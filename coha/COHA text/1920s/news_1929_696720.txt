txt J. Ramsay , Prime Minister of Great Britain , returned last night to what he described as the city of his adoption , confident that out of his historic conversations with President Hoover would come a new era of peace . His official visit had ended in Washington and he was here for three days as the city 's guest before leaving for Canada . The Premier was plainly tired , although he did not betray his fatigue as he rode through the streets to his hotel . His soft brown hat was off continuously in response to . spontaneous cheers and his smile was quick and genial . When , however . he reached the hotel the . marks ? of his strenuous days in Washington began to show . As he faced a score of interviewer , in his room there was a slight sag to-his sturdy shoulders . The shadows of fatigue showed under his deep-set brown eyes and there was a trace of weariness in his voice . When he spoke of Anglo-American efforts to further world-wide amity the subject stimulated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured the fancy of New York when he paused here a week ago on his way to the conferences with the President . Pleased at Nation 's Response . Then his mission was unfulfilled . He said that he looked forward with hope to the fruition of his task . Yesterday the task was completed and as he looked back he expressed delight over the response of the nation to his visit , which had been " pleasant and very profitable . " " I am going away , " he said earnestly , " convinced that under the more genial atmosphere which has thus been created there will be a satisfactory harvest of results . " The Prime Minister and his party , including his daughter , Miss Ishbel , reached Jersey City at 4:30 P. M. He was escorted to the . Hotel Weylin and last night he dined privately at the home of Thomas W. Lamont , a member of J. P. Morgan &; Co . While Miss was viewing the last act of a musical comedy her father sought rest to fortify himself for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's program calls for three speeches , and in between their delivery he will receive at least two deputations and meet as many personal friends as time permits . He will speak at 1 P. M. - at the Hotel Astor luncheon of the English-speaking.Union . At 4 R M. he will address members and guests of the Foreign Policy Association at a tea and reception in the Hotel Commodore . and at 7 P. M. he will make an important speech at the Council on Foreign Relations dinner to be held in the Ritz-Carlton . Chats on the Train . Mr. spent his time on the train from Washington chatting with friends and catching only occasional glimpses of the scenery . He halted at - Philadelphia to give a luncheon to the physicians and nurser who attended him two and half Year% ago when he was seriously ill there during a-tour . After leaving Philadelphia for U , e run to Jersey City Miss went to the bal-gagsa coach . f the special train and earreed. over a telephone to the engineer , taking him not to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Railroad of New Jersey , the Jersey City terminal of the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad , which supplied the special , was bright with bunting . The platform where the train pulled in was draped . - with the Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack , and two shields of the intertwined flags were at the gates . Fifty policemen from Jersey City were posted iron the platform to the ferry slip . A crowd of about 500 persons was kept rigidly back of ropes , and a special contingent of railroad police saw to it that only members of the official party were on the platform when the train arrived . Sir Harry G ! ester Armstrong . Brit . ish Consul General , greeted the Prime Minister as he stepped from his coach . Automobiles for the party were in waiting , and as thirteen New York motorcycle men fell in ahead the machines were .. . driven onto the ferryboat Bayonne . The boat , glistening in fresh paint and with every electric light turned on , was reserved for the Premier and his party . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While baggage was being ? stowed away below there was a wait of ten minutes . Wearing a single-breasted blue suit and carrying a stick , the Prime Minister braved a rather nipping wind from the river . When the Bayonne headed out into ritidstream for the run up to West Twenty-third Street , the wind in'hacreased , but Mr. , who as faced sterner winds in his native highlands , held to his post . Once , a fiercer gust caught his bat and sent it-spinning along the deck . A guard nabbed the hat as it headed for the rail and the river . The British and the American flags were flown from the ferryboat , and as this caught the eye of tugboat captains they pulled the valves of their whistles in greeting . Members of the crews of British steamships at the Chelsea piers waved as the Premier passed . A crowd of several hundred persons were in the ferryhouse as the boat nosed ' into its slip . Mr. and his party were escorted down to the automobiles and the procession shot through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maze . The honking and hard-riding motorcycle men cleared traffic right and left as the procession went on over to Fifth Avenue and turned north in that thoroughfare . It was 5:15 P. M. and the avenue was jammed . Offices were letting out , the shops sent more thousands to the sidewalks and the traffic was as tangled and as heavy as only Fifth Avenue at its peak hours can provide . The motorcycles cut the traffic cleanly , and the Premier and his party had the experience of cutting in and out , in snakelike contortions , between the other cars . The Fifth Avenue buses were halted until the procession passed . The blare of horns and the British colors served to identify the flight of cars to the public , and cheers and waves were Mr. 's lot all the way uptown . The cars turned off Fifth Avenue at Fifty-fourth Street and sped over to Madison to the Weylin The lobby and the facade of the hotel were pi fusely draped with the colors of the two nations . Arriving at the hotel , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenth floe : and at once acceded to a request for an interview . The newspaper representatives we : e ushered into the living room of one of the suites . The Prime Minister , hands plunged in his trousers poele eta with one thumb protruding and serving as a resting place for his silver-rimmed nose glasses , met them , vith smiles . Sir Robert Van Sittart , iris secretary , was by his side . " Well , gentlemen , " said Mr. Mac ) onald , " I ani ready to answer retty nearly all questions you can lk me . " Tomorrow Premier 's Birthday . Then , when a question did not fol , v immediately , he spoke of his leasure in being back again in the ity which had given him its free-3M upon his arrival . " I feel that I have returned to a ity of adoption , " he said . " I have a ' amily interest in New York now and I feel very proud of it . The official visit is over . It has been very pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fact came out that tomorrow is his birthday . He will be 64 . Mr. was asked if he planned any special observance of the day . " That is in the hands of my friends , " he said , his eyes twinkling . " I shall be seeing friends most of the day , I think . Of course there are none among you who can feel it . but when you get over the age of 60 you feel that a birthday is an occasion for quiet contemplation . both of the past and of the future . " The Prime Minister was asked if he expected to speak at the convention of the American Federation of Labor , which will be in session next Tuesday when he reaches Toronto . Mr. said that he had hoped to speak . but that his Canadian program , arranged far in ad. vance , was so full he - would*not have time to address the labor organization . " Besides there are so many things that I shall have to do in Toronto , " he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " When another question concerning the labor meeting was put Mr. , chief of the British Labor party , re-emphasized the non-political nature of his visit . " I should like to make this clear . " he said . " I am not here as a party man . I am not here as a Republican , and not here as a Democrat . I am here officially representing a nation . I speak as nation to nation . " I have been a guest of a nation composed of all colors and creeds and when I am out visiting I play the game straight . I speak as from one nation to another , and I can not allow any secondary disputes to arise and obscure the sole mission for which I am here . " After a short rest in his rooms , the Premier motored to the home of Mr. Lamont at 107 East Seventieth Street .
