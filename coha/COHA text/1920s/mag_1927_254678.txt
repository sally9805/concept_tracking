There is no doubt that Pilot Clarence Duncan Chamberlin and Passenger Charles A. Levine accomplished a heroic feat ( TIME , June 13 ) . Daring , they made a non-stop flight of 3,905 miles-the longest in history . Resolute , they reached Berlin after twice being forced to descend en route . Worthy , they were honored by President Paul von Hindenburg and the German people . <P> Yet , despite their courage , despite their achievement , certain critics , captious , unpraising , sought to undermine their standing as heroes . Passenger Levine was particularly subjected to ill-natured criticism . Glorious in itself , their flight was followed by a series of " incidents " regrettably interfering with true appreciation of their accomplishment . Prominent among such incidents were : <P> Unlucky . Among the first utterances of Passenger Levine , after landing in Germany , was a cablegram to the Hearst press : " Lindbergh was lucky and we were not . If we had had one-tenth of Lindbergh 's luck , we would have done much better . The wind was against us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we flew for 44 hours , and covered 4,400 miles as against Lindbergh 's 33 hours and 3,600 miles . But Lindbergh was lucky and we were not . " <P> Coolidge 's Congratulations . The Jewish Press was irate because President Coolidge ignored Passenger Levine in cabling congratulations to Pilot Chamberlin . Said The Day ( Jewish daily published in Manhattan ) : " At last we , too , are convinced of the great economy of our President . He is so parsimonious , he watches so closely the cash register of Uncle Sam that even the great sum of about 66c ( the cost of cabling three words to Germany ) is of importance to him . . . . <P> " Two men left New York ; two men risked their lives ; two men have shown heroism and created a record even greater than Lindbergh 's . Two men left ; two men arrived , Americans both . But the President of the United States congratulates only one , and by strange coincidence the one whom the President has not found worthy of being mentioned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would Roosevelt have acted in this way ? Would Wilson have done it , or , for that matter Alfred Smith if he happened to be in the White House ? But why should we wonder ? Was ever a man with a Jewish name honored and recognized during the last Administration ? <P> " Sixty-six cents economy , or the recognition of an American pioneer-and the 66c win , or is it only because the pioneer happens to be called Levine ? " <P> Cancelled Stamps . Postmaster General Harry S. New reprimanded Fred Sealy , Hempstead , L. I. , postmaster , because he had cancelled air mail stamps on 250 letters which Passenger Levine carried across the Atlantic . Neither Levine nor Chamberlin had any right to carry U. S. mail . Furthermore , the cancellation and the trip to Europe increased the value of each stamp from a few cents to $50 to $1,000 , according to varying estimates . Several dozen of the letters bearing these stamps were said to be addressed to Passenger Levine . <P> Said Hempstead Postmaster Sealy : " Gosh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know that there was any controversy between the Post Office and Mr. Levine . <P> " Gosh , I did n't mean any harm . I just felt patriotic and wanted to do a personal favor-that 's all . "
