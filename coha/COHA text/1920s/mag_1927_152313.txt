Since Judge Elbert H. Gary 's death ( TIME , Aug. 22 ) no one until last week had spoken as he did for the U. S. Steel Corp . He would rarely , except for politic reasons , let anyone else stand as spokeman for the corporation . Then came a meeting of the board of directors and potent finance committee , and there was melancholy necessity for a presiding officer for each . The duty , in both cases , fell to the corporation 's president , practical Steelmaker James Augustine Farrell . His post-meeting statement , optimistic as most of Judge Gary 's had been , was : " . . . Improvement in steel business , an increase in volume and firmer prices . " <P> Commentators , who attempted to prognosticate Judge Gary 's successor , saw in last week 's event President Farrell as the chief executive officer of U. S. Steel Corp . Head of the directorate and the finance committee might be Myron Charles Taylor , lawyer ( like Judge Gary ) , banker , member of both bodies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
