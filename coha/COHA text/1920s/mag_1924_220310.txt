John W. Davis spent the week following his notification struggling with party organization in Manhattan and preparing his later speeches and his itinerary . At best , a national political campaign in America is but a temporary alliance of local units . The only permanent political organizations are the local ones . National party organizations give an appearance of permanence , but in reality partake rather of the nature of a loose federation which , to a certain degree , is brought into a closer union at election time . <P> It is an open secret at present that the Democratic National organization is weak , uncoordinated . Mr. Davis ' selection of Clem Shaver of West Virginia as Chairman of the National Committee did nothing to improve this condition . Mr. Shaver is not only shy and inexperienced , but as yet he has failed to exhibit traces of the dynamic , directing energy which is necessary to knit the local organizations into a great unit for the purposes of a national campaign . Many of the local units are strong , but they remain largely uncoordinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rests largely on the candidate himself . He has been overtaken by a host of necessary conferences , of campaign appointments , of arrangements for raising adequate campaign funds . His duties are doubled . He has Herculean labor ahead . <P> There is one respect in which his trouble is diminished . The Democrats are usually faced with more difficulties in raising campaign funds than are the Republicans . This is evidently going to be the case this year . In spite of the misfortune for Mr. Davis which has risen from the fact that he has been labeled " a lawyer of the big business interests , " the fact remains that these same interests seem more inclined to contribute to the Coolidge than the Davis campaign chest . But a report came out of Washington that , at President Coolidge 's orders , the Republicans are going to limit their campaign expense to 2 or 3 million dollars . This is less than half the amount which the Republicans spent in 1920 , and offers the Democrats an opportunity of coming nearer parity with their opponents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years .
