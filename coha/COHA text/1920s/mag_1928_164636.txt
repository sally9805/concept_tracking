Every nation wants for itself the glory of making and breaking records . Italy is no exception . Vexed because major aeronautical records were scarce in Italy , because the Schneider Cup race had been lost to England , Dictator Mussolini last winter ordered civil aviators to concentrate on the problem of record-gathering . Obligingly , three faithful Fascists chalked up three new records in a little more than three months . <P> Major Mario de Bernardi , hero of the 1926 Schneider Cup race , when Italy wrested the trophy from the U. S. , was the first to obey Mussolini 's command . Already the holder of the seaplane speed record , he went up last March and averaged 318.57 miles an hour over a measured course , beating his own record by more than 20 miles ( TIME , April 9 ) . <P> Scarcely had the echoes of this achievement died down when two veteran Italian aviators turned to the record business in earnest . Captain Arturo Ferrarin , 32-year-old War veteran , pilot of bombers and pursuit planes , was a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delprete accompanied Commander Francesco de Pinedo on his tour of the Americas in 1927 . No tyros , these two airmen chose a thick-winged Savoia-Marchetti monoplane , set out to break the endurance record won for the U. S. by Stinson and Haldeman . They remained in the air 58 hours and 34 minutes , bringing another major record to Italy . <P> Dictator Mussolini , eager for records , frowned upon trans-Atlantic hops . To Record-Holders Ferrarin and Delprete , however , he could not refuse permission to attempt the long and difficult flight from the mainland of Europe to South America . Pilot Clarence Duncan Chamberlin and Passenger Charles A. Levine had set the airline distance record at 3,911 miles with their flight from Roosevelt Field ( N. Y. ) to Eisleben , Germany . The distance from Rome to Brazil , by any calculation , is over 4,000 miles . Ferrarin and Delprete took off from Monticelio Flying Field , Rome , last week , in the same single-motored Savoia-Marchetti which had weathered the endurance test . <P> They were in the air for more than two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed at Point Genipabu , ten miles north of Natal , Brazil , having flown 4,417 miles* to give Dictator Mussolini his third major record of the year . <P> Italy 's press burst into florid rhetoric . The Nobile disaster had pained and depressed the most patriotic editors , but Ferrarin and Delprete pushed the Polar Pilgrim into obscure corners . Typical of the unrestrained expression of the newspapers was the comment of Lavoro : " It almost seems that today in all the skies of the world can be heard the palpitating of Italian wings ; from the overcast skies of the Arctic regions to the scintillating heavens of the tropics is being carried that great magic word , ' Italia , ' by intrepid hearts and by robust wings . ... " Somewhat obscurely , La Tribuna mused : " We are in the presence of the flight of an entire generation of Italians and we ourselves are at once actors and spectators . " <P> Should Dictator Mussolini 's eagerness remain unsatisfied , what can obedient Fascists add to Italy 's aeronautical glories ? Rival nations reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Italian onslaught . Among them : <P> Balloons : <P> Endurance ( Germany ) - Hugo Kaulen , 87 hrs . <P> Distance ( Germany ) - Berliner , 1,896.9 miles .
