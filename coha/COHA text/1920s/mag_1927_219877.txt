On important issues before the Senate there often develops " a little group of willful men , " to confound the majority . The group changes with the issue . Last week it was composed of a few old-guard Republicans and one Demo-cratic buffoon . It was dangerous because the end of the session was near . By a 40%-hour filibuster it accomplished its purpose , damaged its members , killed an appropriation bill and a half dozen other important pieces of legislation . <P> This group-David A. Reed of Pennsylvania , sometimes called a " higher type of statesman " ; George H. Moses of New Hampshire , implacable diehard ; James E. Watson of Indiana , old-school behind-the-scenes man ; a few other Republicans ; and Democrat , Cole L. Blease of South Carolina , whom only Mr. Heflin robs of the title " Buffoon of the Senate " - were determined to prevent Senator James A. Reed 's committee from making any more campaign fund investigations . Mr. Reed of Pennsylvania , particularly , did not want his distant cousin , Mr. Reed of Missouri , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vare . The Pennsylvanian insisted that the regular Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections , containing a majority of old-guard Republicans , was best fitted to count these ballots . The result was the Battle of the Cousins which displaced all other Senate business ; which turned Senators into a pack of snarling , sleepless animals ; which littered the chamber with apple cores , pitchers of ice water and ancient documents . The time-filling tactics of the filibusterers were crude . Instead of reading Shakespeare or Byron , they had the clerk read yesterday 's journal . Senator Cameron plodded through a document on copper mining , of which he could not pronounce some of the words . Senator Moses , protectionist , read a four-year-old low tariff speech of Senator Underwood . Senator Blease mouthed the Constitution of South Carolina and described the life and death of Jefferson Davis . Senator Reed of Pennsylvania mumbled election returns from his state , said he hoped to reach Georgia by dawn . A correspondent in the press gallery whispered : " Poor fellow , Reed would stand on his head on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " The Senate restaurant was out of coffee . Mr. Heflin was asleep on a lounge ; a thoughtful jester had covered him with a red drapery . <P> Senator Warren was pleading for his deficiency appropriation bill ( see below ) . Once it seemed likely that a compromise would be reached . Senator Reed of Missouri offered to displace his investigating resolution to allow quick passage of the deficiency bill , the alien property bill and the public buildings bill . Thereupon , Mr. Blease wandered in , half-asleep . He heard the words " unanimous consent . " He shouted : " I object . " Nobody was going to pull any wool over his eyes . <P> The filibuster went through the dawn , through the next day , into the next night . At midnight the Senate adjourned until 8:30 a. m . From that hour until the final adjournment at noon , the wrangling grew bitterer . . . bitterer . <P> " These shrewish scoldings , " began Mr. Reed of Pennsylvania . <P> " Oh , I hope the Senator is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas .
