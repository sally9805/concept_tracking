" J. Pierpont Morgan takes Judge Gary 's place as chairman of the United States Steel board of directors . That will please stockholders . Mr. Morgan 's father created the company , with the assistance of Judge Gary , James A. Farrell* and other able citizens , and changed a half a billion worth of stock that Carnegie called ' not even water , mere air ' into stock , now worth more than $220 a share , the 40 per cent dividend included . <P> " To change ' thin air ' to a solidly established stock worth more than a billion real dollars shows what American business can do . " <P> In such summary fashion did that super-journalist , Arthur Brisbane , dispose of an item of financial information that had appeared on the front page of almost every U. S. newssheet . He had apparently forgotten to point out the name of the little-known man who had been elected , with John P. Morgan , the new chairman of the board , and James Augustine Farrell , new chief executive officer , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was Myron Charles Taylor who had been made head of the finance committee . <P> Of the first two , there was little to be said . It was true that John P. Morgan , the big , impressive , genial 61-year-old , Episcopal banker , whose name in every language is a synonym for the power of wealth , had never before accepted a principal office in an enterprise which his banking house had financed. * Many people have observed the increasing potency of silver-haired , 65-year-old , Catholic James Augustine Farrell , whose father was a New Haven shipowner . <P> Myron Charles Taylor , the 54-year-old Quaker , was born in Lyons , New York . After graduating from Cornell , in 1894 , he practised law in Manhattan until his legal connections brought him an advantageous opportunity to enter the textile industry in which other members of his family already held interests . None of them had ever displayed the energy or ability which characterized the operations of Myron Taylor . The consolidations which he effected , his ability to push his companies into prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention of George Fisher Baker , Chairman of the First National Bank of Manhattan . Banker Baker , who with the first John P. Morgan and the late Judge Gary constituted the first U. S. steel triumvirate , made Mr. Taylor a director of his bank . <P> Gradually , Myron Taylor cut down his textile holdings and became essentially a banker . He was elected to the directorate of two railroads- the New York Central and the Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe ; he was made a trustee of the Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York . It was rumored that Banker Baker persuaded Myron Taylor to become one of the directors of U. S. Steel ; surely , it was his support coupled with the approval of John P. Morgan that gave Myron Taylor one of the three executive offices in this gargantuan corporation .
