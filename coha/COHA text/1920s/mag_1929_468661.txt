SPONTANEOUS uprisings of the people are few . There is some patient quality in man that makes him endure long past the point of actual suffering . Especially is this true of man 's economic state . It is appallingly easy to get used to poverty ; if one has been poor always one can scarcely comprehend any other way of living . When I first learned last winter that a wave of spontaneous strikes was sweeping through the mill villages of the South I was skeptical . I know how helpless and docile leaderless workers are . I remembered the complaint of one good striker , Reilly , to Elizabeth Gurley Flynn , " Gee ! Gurley , me fut is bruk on me ! I been assistin ' at a spontaneous uprisin ' o ' th ' workers . Me an ' Finnegan kicked them Ilunkies in the pants an ' they spontaneously arose an ' wint out of th ' fact'ry 1 " Many " spontaneous " uprisings have had such motivating causes ? but not that in Gastonia , North Carolina , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the number of people who had struck which made this Southern revolt significant . It was the number and variety of communities involved . It was also the fact that those primitive and unorganized workers had struck without union or leaders . There was a shouldering thrust as of a folk movement ? of a great many mute , patient people being driven by desperation to revolt . They had moved in almost a score of communities separated by miles . Over the mountains in Tennessee the rayon workers had struck . Far away in Thompson , Georgia , the workers had struck too ; and through all the textile towns they were quiveringly awake . One remembered the weavers ' revolt of the last century . There was a reverberation of strikes through the textile South . People were talking strike everywhere . Everywhere these " loyal and one hundred per cent American workers " were talking of organization . In widely separated mill towns you will find the same reasons for discontent . There are two of equal force ? the introduction of the Bedaud efficiency system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the substantial cutting of wages which has been almost universal during the past two or three years . Through the operation of the stretch-out men and women often do double work while they receive Iess pay . The mill hands who endured long hours and low pay as their lot , broke down under the burden which was laid upon them . One after another I have heard them say , " We could not do it . " The effect of the stretch-out was explained to me most lucidly by a strike leader in Greenville , South Carolina , named Rochester . He is thirty-seven and has worked twenty-nine years in the mill . He began to work in the mill in 1900 when he was eight years old and did not make a penny his first month . Later he got seventeen cents a week . When he made a quarter a day he " thought he was running into money . " " It amounts to this , " he said . " They cut my wages and increased my work . I used to tend forty-eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety looms , and I could n't do it . Three years ago I was makin ' over $19 a week . Now I make $17.70 . I ai n't a-braggin ' . I 'm an experienced weaver . I do n't believe there 's many can beat me . I make a hundred per cent , the most any weaver can make . " He hopes again to make nineteen dollars , the highest reward to which he can aspire for a lifetime of unremitting work . The average weekly wage scale in the great Loray Mill in Gastonia , North Carolina , is less , apparently owing to the parings and cuttings of workers ' wages by the management . In 19 ' 27 , $500,000 was saved on the payroll without cutting production . To make this possible two people had to do the work of three . Piece-work prices were cut . This mighty saving was continued up to the moment of the strike . The workers in the Loray Mill went out on strike on the same heaving surge of revolt which runs to-day through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spontaneous demonstration even though a single organizer of the National Textile Workers ' Union , Fred Beal , had been laying the foundation of a labor union in that mill . At the beginning of the strike whose tragic climax has been filling the newspapers of the country only a handful had as yet joined the union . II The Loray Mill is in West Gastonia . It is owned by the Manville-Jenekes Company , a Rhode Island concern . The mile of road which separates Gastonia from its suburb begins with ample houses surrounded by rose gardens . In West Gastonia the same street which began so pleasantly is lined with brick and wooden stores whose wares tell eloquently of how little people buy . The great mill dominates the settlement . Behind it is the mill village , a flock of little houses all alike , perched each one on brick stilts . The big mill is like a huge hen with uncounted chicksaround it , so obviously do the little houses belong to the mill from which a roar of turning wheels comes night and day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the little houses go into the mill . It is their whole life . The strikers ' lawyer , Tom P. Jimison , outlined for me the course which the strike took . On April 1 , seventeen hundred of the twenty-two hundred employees of the mill came out on strike . The immediate cause was the discovery of union activities and the discharge of union members . On April e the public street was roped off to prevent the strikers from approaching the mill . The workers pulled the rope from the hands of the police . The Governor was then asked for troops . During the first days of the strike there were large and orderly picket lines . These picket lines were broken up with increasing severity . Workers were beaten after their arrest and scores were thrown into jail . All the leaders were arrested at one time or another . Gastonia was in a ferment . As soon as the strike was called , Vera Ruch , Ellen Dawson , and George Pershing were sent down as organizers from the headquarters of the National Textile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements , which was active in textile strikes in Passaic and New Bedford . The feeling in the town against the Northern organizers ran high . Welldressed people swore at them when they appeared on the streets of Gastonia . Threatening letters and telephone messages were frequent . Since then Mr. Jimison 's life has been threatened for defending them in the murder trial . The National Textile Workers ' Union had rented a small shack on the main street of West Gastonia which it used as strike headquarters . An empty store near-by had been hired as a relief depot , and to it the strikers went daily to get their food supplies . This relief store was supported by the Workers ' International Relief , an organization which collects money from labor unions for workers on strike . I speak of these two buildings especially because it was against them , instead of against the strike leaders , that the threats of mob violence materialized . On the night of April 18 a mob of between one hundred and fifty and two hundred masked men descended upon the headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . They broke into the relief store , smashed the windows , and threw the supplies of food intended for women and children out into the road and destroyed them . The nine boys who , unarmed , were guarding the headquarters and store were arrested by National Guardsmen . None of the raiders was arrested . The militia was dismissed at the end of that week . A large number of extra deputies were then sworn in and armed with bayonets . On Monday , April 22 , they charged the picket line with bayonets and blackjacks . A reporter was beaten unconscious . Women were beaten . Men and women , their clothing torn , were scratched with bayonets . Large numbers were arrested . The events of that Monday afternoon were a premeditated attempt to terrorize the workers from holding the picket line . This was the general state of affairs when I arrived . A Grand Jury had already been called to investigate the mob outrage , which was very badly looked upon throughout the State . It failed to bring indictments or to throw any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nine guards made affidavit that they recognized members of the mill police among their assailants . III The first day I was in West Gastonia a striker , guiding me to the open lot where the " talking " was , pointed out the little lamentable wrecked building . Fred . Beal was addressing a big crowd from a square platform . It was the first time I had seen an audience ofpurely American workers at such a meeting and I found the sight of them unexpectedly moving . I got an impression of a people unmistakably American yet of a different flavor from any I had ever known . Fred Beal is wide-shouldered and heavily built ; boyish , red-haired , sunburned , with very blue eyes set far apart . He has absolutely no pose , no " front " whatsoever . He is unassuming and seemingly unconscious that he is a big man hereabouts . He is one of the few young men who can stand the applause of crowds . He was sweating when he got off the platform . He slumped down in depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the picket line , he said , without their guns . When the militia had been succeeded by deputies with bayonets , the strikers had gaily said , " We 'll get our guns , too ! " This they had been restrained from doing by the young organizer from the North . The mountaineers were glum enough about this . Without their guns they felt emasculated , deprived of their manhood . Beal felt deeply both his responsibility and his isolation in the South . For the moment he was the most conspicuous person in North Carolina . In the eyes of the well-to-do people and the mill owners , he was the " outside agitator , " a menace which threatened the peace of the commonwealth . His shoulders , though broad , were not quite broad enough to carry the burden of so much hatred . But if he was the object of fear and hatred of thousands , he was also the spark of hope of thousands more . As Fred Beal walked through the crowd you could see the people loved him . The faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women broke into smiles at the sight of him . He and the other Northern organizers were the focus of so much emotion that it was as if they were small incandescent points of radiance made visible by the burden of love and hatred which they carried . There was an apprehensiveness among them that had nothing to do with fear . It was almost as if they , and Beal especially , had a prescience of what was coming . They all agreed that the terrible weight of public enmity oppressed them , this core of white-hot hate which the South visited upon them . Around these young people were the gaunt mill workers , who are all of them American of the early English migrations . They come from the hills and from tenant farms in the valleys . It is largely upon the cheapness of their labor that the textile South has based its mighty development . Northern capital has poured in to take advantage of the " one-hundred-per-cent loyal American labor , " following the advertisements which in the trade journals have read " Avoid labor troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The laws requiring children to go to school until they are fourteen have been in effect only a few years . It is not unusual to find mill workers in their late twenties who already have worked twenty years . Such people are , of necessity , illiterate . Yet there is a direct quality , a completeness about them . They do not belong to this century . Their point of view toward the elan , their kin , society , their bosses , is of the seventeenth or eighteenth century . The doubts of our time have escaped them . They arc living in another day , when man occupied the center of the universe and communicated directly with his God . And when , moreover , he was the head of the family . Poverty and lack show in their every line . The old women dress in dark , homemade calicoes as they did in the mountains . They show the effects of malnutrition . Pellagra is common among them and has increased during the last two years . Yet the men have dignity and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of hospitality . The little girls are often exquisite ? many of them blonde and blue-eyed andvery English in appearance . At forty they are old women . The men are tall and spare and strong looking . One sometimes sees one of the Lincoln type -- tall , rangy , and lantern-jawed . Among the women one frequently comes upon that delicate and lovely profile which has made Southern women famous for beauty . The women of forty who look so worn still have heartbreaking moments of evanescent love-Ii Like all people who read but little , they are great story tellers and they love a political argument . They are law-abiding and have the Jeffersonian jealousy of their constitutional rights . No policeman may enter a house without showing his warrant . They believe that a man should defend his rights as he defends his honor . Among these mill " hands " you will find names that are famous in Southern history ; they are many of them descendants of the men who turned the tide of battle at Kings Mountain , which is only a few miles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikers and the history of the strike to look at its setting . I spent some time acquainting myself with the look of the city and its surroundings . Nothing I had read prepared me for what I saw . The industrial revolution had here run its completed cycle in thirty years . I found myself in the presence of an industrial development which was so gigantic and had been encompassed in so brief a time , that it had the terror of incalculable energy . There is in North Carolina a sense of ordered direction as though these multitudinous cotton mills had not sprung up for many varied reasons , but as though the whole industrial South was the plan of one . The transformation of North Carolina , within a period of thirty years , from a sleepy agricultural State still struggling with the problems of reconstruction to one of the richest States in the Union , is a miracle . The cities have appeared as if by magic . North Carolina is so beautiful and so finished , there is such mastery in its great highways , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superman ? the result of a stupendous , organized plan . It has beauty enough to make the fortune of a European country . In the springtime red , fertile plowed hillsides overwhelm the eyes with the flame of their color . There is no poet who has sung adequately of the gamut of reds which shout and sing in the Piedmont fields , and which in the evening light are washed with purple . Among the red fields marches a mighty procession of ordered factories . And again one has the impression that the red earth has blossomed spontaneously and monstrously with red brick and plate glass ; as if the God of Machines of the industrial revolution had said " Let there be factories " and there were factories . Take the city of Gastonia , with its twenty-two thousand inhabitants . It is situated in the southern part of North Carolina in that principality within states known as Piedmont . This is the high red-earth country which begins in Virginia and continues through the Carolinas . It encloses within its confines the richest portion of the textile industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gastonia is one . Thirty years ago Gastonia was a hamlet on the crossroads . It gives the impression of having sprung out of the earth fully equipped . There is a new city hall , a new courthouse , a new county jail , all fine buildings . On an elevation stands a splendid new high school . There is a great orthopedic hospital , where miracles are performed on children and where nearly ninety per cent of the work is done free . The only public building lacking is a library , and this lack , one feels sure , will soon be remedied by Gastonia 's public-spirited citizens . There are new churches and new residenceseverywhere . The city is completely surrounded by fine new mills , of which I was told that the Loray in West Gastonia is the largest . Few if any of these mills are over thirty years old . It is they which have supported the prosperity of the town and its well-to-do people . The mills created Gastonia , the city of spindles . It is handsome , prosperous , thriving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from farms supporting the handsome city . The picture one gets is as complete as an egg . Gastonia tells you its story , loud and clear , the very first day . The order of these modern factories with their new machines is in strong contrast with the absurd disorder of mob violence : men with stockings pulled over their faces chopping down union headquarters and throwing workers ' food into the street ; militia called out against these workers ; Americans chased by deputies with bayonets on American streets ; all the old silly saws printed in the papers about the trouble being caused by outside agitators . How , the visitor asks himself , can a community be so orderly about industry and so disorderly about human life ? The answer was clear . Although other parts of the United States had already accepted the economic theory that short hours and high wages lead to prosperity , this splendid , vigorous , vital South had not yet attacked the human problem . V There was no communication , I found , between the mill people and the well-to-do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be found at least a few women who would contribute to a milk fund for the babies ? . for this is one thing for which one can always get a committee in a Northern community , even among people who disapprove violently of unions ? he answered bitterly : " You do n't understand . You , in the North , think of workers as human beings . The folks here think of them as hands ! " They can hardly think of them otherwise under the existing system of paternalism . Each factory is surrounded by a settlement of company houses . In East Gastonia , surrounding such factories as the Plymouth , are pleasant streets with rose- and vine-bowered cottages ; elsewhere bare dwellings stand in naked and sun-dried earth . There are all grades of villages between the two extremes . The mill village will be bare or flowering according to the will of the factory owner . Within seven miles of Gastonia are to be found villages both better and worse than those within city limits . Cramerton is one of the mill towns where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But whether the towns give information concerning a good or bad master , it is always a master of whom they speak . There are towns in North Carolina which are not incorporated . This means that the very roads belong to the mill owner . He hires the police force , and if the schoolmaster or the minister does not please him he must go . In such towns paternalism becomes a despotic autocracy . There are many mill owners throughout the South whose paternalism is infused with an ardent desire to do all that they can for the workers . There are few mills within corporate limits to-day which have not some form of welfare work . There are often women nurses and welfare workers attached to the factory . Some mills have ball fields , recreation grounds , community houses . Frequently day nurseries and rooms are provided where women may nurse their babies , the time they are absent being taken , of course , from their pay . The workers buy their food at the company store . They buy their coal , oil , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company doctor attends them . All this , of course , will be deducted from their pay . Conscientious mill owners frankly consider their " hands " as children , incapable of taking care of themselves . But whether their conditions are good or bad does not depend upon the workers ' joint effort to control hours , wages , and factory conditions . All depends upon the policy of the owners . Company houses covered with roses still remain company houses . The workers can not own them . Community activities do not raise the wage scale , which is so low that almost without exception children of fourteen go to the mill as a matter of course . Mothers of young children must work at night . I heard of these things in terms of human lives . The strikers wanted to talk about themselves . Every day yielded stories like that of Mary Morris , who passed all the young years of her marriage in want because " when I was goin ' to have a baby and got so I could n't work , they 'd fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless there 's two hands in the family working . " Or of Daisy McDonald , who told me she has to support a husband and family of seven children on $1.90 a week . " My husband lost his leg and has a tubercular bone . What do you think 's left to feed my people on when I pay my weekly expenses ? My home rent is $1.50 , light 50 cents to 85 cents , furniture $1.00 , insurance $1.25 . What do you think was left the week I paid $e.eo for wood ? " " I used to work in the Myers Mill in South Gastonia , and they would n't take my husband unless I worked too , and I had a little baby . " James Ballentyne added another detail . It was a story of police brutality which recurred often in different forms . " I was leading the picket line and I was trying to get through a mob of deputies . They said , ' What do you think you 're doing ? ' I said ' Leading a picket line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . They jumped on me and hit me with clubs over the head and in the belly so I was spitting blood and hemorrhaging all night . It was two weeks ago , and I ai n't well yet . I was all mashed up inside . " When I had seen some of the sights of Gastonia 1 went strike-sightseeing with a minister from Greensboro . We were going about strike headquarters getting the addresses of some of the people who had been chased with bayonets by the police , in order to verify to our satisfaction some of the well-nigh incredible stories poured into our ears by strikers and organizers , when Amy Schechter , the relief director , came up saying , " They 're evicting people over in the ravine ! " We drove to the place , a striker guiding us . A woman I had noticed at headquarters , a Mrs. Winebarger , was standing in front of a lamentable little heap of household furnishings . Pots , pans , bedding , bureaus were piled helter-skelter . What had been a home of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children sat solemnly on the heaped-up wreckage . The baby was asleep at a neighbor 's . It waked up presently , and the little girl lugged it around . We went into the house , which like most houses in the neighborhood was built without a cellar and stood on little brick pillars . The lumber was of the cheapest . There were knot-holes in the floor through which the wind poured . ( This was not a company house but was owned by a private landlord . ) Mrs. Winebarger told us , " It rained in like a sieve . When it rained we had to keep moving our beds around to keep them dry . " She had never had the electric lights turned on . " Where 'd I get my five dollars for the deposit ? " she asked angrily , for she was angry at her house , at the circumstances of her life , and she wanted to go back to the mountains whence she had come . " But it would cost an awful lot to get us back ? fifteen dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting him and her four children on what she made . She had a venomous feeling toward thehouse which had finally spewed her forth . " Look at that chimney ! It always smoked ! We could n't have no fire here ! We could n't keep warm . Once , I was buyin ' a coal stove for my kitchen and I had $19 paid on it . Then I had to buy medicine for him and I could n't make my payments and they tuk my stove away . " The furniture of the mill workers is almost inevitably bought on the installment plan . Mrs. Winebarger made $12-50 a week . She paid $1.50 a week for house rent , between fifty cents and a dollar for fuel and light , and more than a dollar a week for medicine . The house was a bungalow of four rooms . It had a fairly wide hall and small shallow fireplaces . Except for its flimsiness it was much better than the tenements of Passaic , New Jersey , or the over-crowded houses of Lawrence , Massachusetts , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mrs. Ada Howell , an old woman who had been beaten up on Monday , April u , after the withdrawal of the militia . Mrs. Howell sat in a rocking chair , her two eyes blackened , her face discolored . It gave one a sense of embarrassment and impotent anger to look at her . She told her story in a detached way . She was curiously without passion as she described something as unbelievable as a nightmare . She had been going to the store for supper on Monday , April 22nd . Policemen came down the street " chasing the strikers before them like rats . " A policeman rushed at her with a bayonet . " He cut my dress and he cut me too . Lawyer Jimison told me I should keep that dress without washing it so I could show it , but I did n't have enough dresses to lay those clothes away . " Her idea was that the policeman had gone crazy . " They acted like crazy men . They was drunk crazed , " her son said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " an ' they must ' a been a-drinkin ' to chase women and little kids with baynits . They chased ' em in and out the relief store like dogs buntin ' rats . " An ' they had n't no call to go in that relief store ? the laws had n't . You ca n't go in any place if you ai n't any warrent . " An ' then the policeman came up an ' bit me between the eyes with his fist . He hit me more'n twenty times , I reckon . I was all swelled up an ' black an ' blue . " I had seen photographs of her mutilated face . We did n't say anything . There did n't seem to be anything to say . I suppose when comfortable people read such stories they think , " This ca n't be true . Why , that just could n't happen in our town . Such things do n't happen . " No wonder they feel this way . We went on . Strike-sightseeing is a rather awful thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be beaten for no reason when they are peacefully proceeding on their business ; there is equal obscenity in the fact that a mother with four children to support has to work all night for $12.50 a week , and then be evicted because she can not pay her rent . It does not seem reasonable that such things should happen here in this country , in 199,9 . This was not the end of the sights Gastonia had to show that day . In the late afternoon I went out to watch the picket line . Perhaps a hundred men , women , and children walked two by two in orderly fashion . The procession was led by two boys and two gay girls of about fifteen , in overalls . The police whistles shrilled . Two or three automobiles containing police and deputies armed with bayonets speeded after the picketers . The picketers walked away from the mills . The deputies herded them with their bayonets . I stood on a high bank , watching . A nice-looking woman was rushed to a waiting car by the police . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her hair and twist her arms cruelly . She struggled . And still theytwisted her arms . Women near me were crying . Murmurs of " Shame ! " came from the crowd . One of the village women grasped my arm , trembling . Everyone was saying , " Why do n't they do something ? " The arrested woman had n't been in the picket line . Her little boy had been swept into the procession as it was rounded up by the police , and she had pulled him out . The reason she had struggled so against arrest was that she had a nursing baby . A few hours after her brutal mauling she was set at liberty . Why was she treated this way ? There is no answer . Why was Mrs. Howell set upon when she was going to the store to get her evening 's supper ? VI A few days after this a mill company began mass evictions . The fifty people evicted that first day lived in houses distributed through the different sections of the mill village . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a mill official remarked grimly . One official stated frankly that it was intentional that union officials and the most active strikers should be the first to be thrown out . Accordingly , the house of J. A. Valentine was one of those where the sheriff and deputies stopped first . Mrs. Valentine was sitting on a bench , a little girl in her arms . The child had been in bed when the mill doctor arrived to see if there was sickness in the house . When the doctor was questioned about her , he answered : " She 's convalescing from the smallpox . She 's all right now ; ai n't any temperature . This ai n't a smallpox-quarantine state . Compulsory vaccination and compulsory school age is enough without quarantine . " On the next street the deputies were at work taking out the possessions of fourteen people . It was Henry Tetherow 's house . Henry is the bead of the family . He is seventeen , and looks fourteen . He and a sister support a family of nine . His father is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of William Truitt , the secretary-treasurer of the local union of the National Textile Workers . " This house has been a hotbed of union meetings , " said the company doctor . " The company 's been patient to let ' em stay here so long . Let ' em stay five weeks . What 's the matter with the little girl in bed ? Oh , she 's got nothin ' but runnin ' ears . Might have ' em for weeks . " Men came out , bringing children 's beds , a basket of pretty glasses , a tiny old-fashioned organ . A big doll was being evicted . Henry , pale of face , very small , wandered at random among the swelling mountain of things . Mrs. Tetherow stood as if she would never move again . At another house in the midst of the immense disorder of eviction a woman sat tranquilly writing a long letter to her husband . Not far from her , tucked into a fold of a featherbed , a little baby lay peacefully sleeping . She was a delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and freshly painted . Only one woman sat crying . The tears slid slowly down her cheeks . She had four small children and expected her new baby to be born any day . Around her were the shards of a home . The work of eviction continued relentlessly day after day . The mill village became a gypsy encampment . People set up stoves and beds in the lots . The dwellers of two hundred homes were evicted . Over a thousand people must have been homeless . VII I went to visit other strike areas , and when I returned the Workers ' International Relief , together with the National Textile Workers ' Union , had erected a tent colony . Close by was a new union headquarters which the strikers had built with their own labor . The tent colony was picturesquely set among woods near a ravine . There was an air of general happiness and wellbeing among the strikers and organizers . There were rumors of great discontent among the workers at the mill . The strikers and the organizers talked hopefully of another walk-out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Hags was walking gaily off toward the picket line . They were led by little Sophia Melvin , who had come down recently from the North to teach organized play to the children , Old friends came up and greeted me . Everybody was brown ; they looked as if they had gained weight since the early days of the strike . The women 's faces were rested . I was told that there had been prowlers around the tent colony and frequent threats that the new headquarters would be destroyed as the old one had been . Because of this the boundaries were patrolled at night by an armed guard . But this did not seem strange to me , coming as I did from Elizabethton , Tennessee . The place where I had stayed there had been guarded every night by boys peering out of the windows , their fingers on the triggers of their guns . It did not seem possible that further trouble should occur . Least of all did the Northern organizers expect it . Yet just a week later , during trouble at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed , and three other policemen and one striker wounded . Two policemen , after a celebration in Mecklenburg County , chased a man into the Catawba River and playfully shot at him . Two hours later they were at the tent colony . It was nine o'clock . The guard refused to allow the police to enter without a warrant . Another policeman tried to disarm a guard . In the scuffle a gun went off and the shooting began . Each side claims the other fired first . In the next few days seventy persons were arrested . Sixteen people , including three women , were held without bail for first-degree murder , the unfailing penalty for which in North Carolina is the electric chair . The death penalty against the three women was later dropped . Seven others were held for conspiracy . Every Northerner , man or woman , was arrested . VIII It is idle to think of Gastonia as a situation peculiar to itself . Edward McGrady , loyal representative of the American Federation of Labor , and Alfred Hoffman of the United Textile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee . In Ware Shoals , South Carolina , George L. Googe , vice-president of the South Carolina Federation of Labor , was threatened by a mob and left town under police protection . There is no doubt in my mind and in the minds of many other people that had it not been for the Northern organizers and their desire to avoid violence the workers would have shot in what they consider self-defense long ago . Not only would they have shot in Gastonia , but also they would have shot in Elizabethton and elsewhere . Everybody in the Carolinas and Tennessee has a gun . Peaceful citizens going on a long journey take revolvers with them as a matter of course . People think in terms of defending themselves . The trial now in progress will concern itself with the question whether the strikers shot in self-defense or not . This trial began with a scene of grotesque unfairness , unprecedented in any American court . A life-sized manikin of Chief of Police 0 . F. Aderholt was rolled into the courtroom dressed in a blood-stained uniform . Conspicuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chief of Police . Confronted with this unexpected sight they burst into tears . Judge M. V. Barnhill , who throughout the trial was a paragon of impartiality , commanded the figure to be removed . The jury and the appalled audience , however , had filled their eyes with the ghastly effigy . Three days later one of the jurors went violently insane ? from the shock he had suffered at the spectacle of the " ghost , " it was claimed . The trial had to be delayed . The defense had not been heard . The principal witnesses for the State had already been examined . Not one of the defendants had been connected with the shooting of the Chief . The released jurors told the press that on the evidence before them they were for acquittal . At this point of the story the mob reappears . Already on the Saturday before , union organizers going to a meeting in South Gastonia had been surrounded by a mob of two hundred , threatened with lynching , and beaten with blackjacks and bottles . The taxi had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only minor injuries . Apparently as a result of the jurors ' statement that they would release the prisoners , an " Anti-Red " demonstration was held in Gastonia on Monday , September 9th , the night the trial came to its abrupt pause . A procession of one hundred cars went to strike headquarters , which was looted . The strike headquarters at Bessemer City , a small town seven miles from Gastonia , was raided . The mob went next to a house in Gastonia where union organizers lived . A hundred men crowded into the house and kidnapped Ben Wells , an Englishman , and C. D. Saylor and C. M. Lell , local men . They were driven to a wood in a neighboring county where Wells was stripped and flogged . Two ' possum hunters heard his cries . The night riders heard the hunters approaching and thought it was the law and fled , leaving Wells unconscious to be rescued by his companions . Meantime the major part of the mob had streamed over the twenty miles that separates Gastonia from Charlotte with cries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Let 's clean up all the Communists ! " " Let 's get out Jimison and lynch him ! " They went to a hotel where some of the Communists and organizers lived and tore up the hotel register and broke fixtures . They proceeded next to the headquarters of the International Labor Defense , an organization which has been defending the accused men as well as those arrested on charges connected with the strike . The sympathizers and organizers in the office had been warned by telephone from Gastonia and escaped only one minute before the arrival of the mob . After breaking into the International Labor Defense office and finding no one there , the mob went to Tom P. Jimison 's house , where they shouted and milled around and finally dispersed . Two significant facts stand out in this night of terror . One is that no police protection was afforded . The other is that the mob was in nowise a rabble but proceeded along planned lines . It is considered by defense counsel part of the reign of terror which has been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raid of June 7th an integral part . The better element in North Carolina has been deeply stirred by this lawlessness in which prominent mill people and members of the police took part . An investigation was promptly begun . Fourteen people were arrested including prominent mill men and police officers who were in the tent colony raid . Members of the Gastonia mob have asserted that they will not stop till they have cleaned out every union organizer in their part of the South . The culmination to mob violence came on September 14th . A truck load of union members were going to an attempted union meeting . The meetingwas never held , armed mobs turning away all union members . The truck turned back to Bessemer City , whence it had come , and was followed by a number of cars containing members of the mob . A car swerved in front of the truck apparently to stop it . The truck crashed it , and the car was upset . Immediately rifle fire was opened on the unarmed workers . A woman was shot through the chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five young children . She was especially beloved among the strikers as the composer of the strike songs and ballads . When the Chief of Police was shot , sixteen people were indicted and tried for murder . It will be interesting to see if anyone will be tried for this murder . Meantime , ever since the arrest of their leaders , the workers have been flowing into the union . This demand of the Southern workers for better conditions , and a union to help them get it , is spreading . The South knows it . Up to now , mob violence , police brutality , wholesale arrests of workers , ordinances against picketing , intimidation , and the calling out of the militia ? in a word , repression has been the only answer the South has made to this movement for economic equality among Southern workers . History shows that repression has always failed . Not all the Inquisitions , not all the Black Hundreds , not all the various spy systems that humanity has devised have ever stopped an idea . If the Southern industrialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody war , bitter and costly . Sooner or later they will have to yield . Political equality can not exist side by side with industrial feudalism.
