txt Ex-Governor Alfred E. Smith went to Tammany Hall yesterday afternoon and had a long talk behind closed doors With Tammany leader Charles F. Murphy . His purpose was to give the lie to recent reports of his willingness to become a candidate for Governor this Fall . He told the Tammany Chairman that he had made up his mind to stay in the trucking business . Tammany leader Murphy afterward declined to discuss the conference in detail . " ' Al ' just dropped in and we had a little talk but there was no political significance to it , " he said . When asked if they had discussed State politics , the Gubernatorial nomination and the nomination for United States Senators , Mr. Murphy smiled . " These matters will be settled by the State Convention , and that does not meet until late in September , " he replied . " That is a long way off yet . " It was Mr. Murphy 's first appearance at the Wigwam in a month , and not only the room where he holds his levees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , office holders and members of the rank and file of Tammany Hall , who had come to seek an audience with " the Boss . " " Can you tell us something about what you expect to do in politics during the Summer and Fall ? " the former Governor was asked just before he hurried away . Will Stick to Trucking . " I am going to stay in the trucking business , " he replied earnestly and emphatically . " That 's what I have been baying right along and yet I wake up to see stories printed to the effect that ' Al Smith is willing to run for Governor ' and stuff like that . I repeat now that I am going to stay in the trucking bualness . " " Of course , " it was suggested , " you may be drafted by your party . That can be done , you know . " " I do not know what the party may do , " he replied . " I am not setting myself up as a person regulating the party or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing either . But I am regulating the affairs of ' AI ' Smith . " " 1 am not saying what may happen in the future , " he added in a more reflective mood . " But I know my own mind as of today  --  April 6  --  and it is exactly as I have just stated to you . " While Tammany Leader Murphy saw most of the district leaders and others with whom he talked at his desk in the big room , his half-hour talk with the former GoVernor was in the room where the Tammany Hall Executive Committee holds its secret meetings . When the Tammany chieftain came out there were at least a score or two doien callers waiting for him . Ex-Sheriff " Tom " Foley , who. returned from Europe recently and was reported to be " full of fight " in the event that a fight should be required to keep his political foe , William R. Hearst , from landing the nomination either for ' Governor or United States Senator with the aid of Murphy , was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The two talked pleasantly for a few minutes , and then " Tom " Foley came away smiling . He declined to be interviewed , but his friends said that they understood he had every reason to feel reassured . Hearst 's Chances Waning . Hearst has no friends among the Tammany regulars . Of those who visited the Wigwam yesterday and were willing to discusft the Fall campaign , the consensus of opinion appeared to be that , while not entirely out of the picture , the possibility of Hearst figuring in the C.ampaign as a candidate was becoming remote . They realize , however , that Hearst 's close relations with Mayor Hylan and the newspapers under his control render him a figure to be reckoned with and that should he make a dead set for the Gubernatorial or Senatorial nomination , Tammany may have to make a fight for him in the convention , much as they would dread and dislike to do it . The campaign and candidates , it was learned last night from persons who talked with Murphy , came in for only incidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper men was that some way would be found to induce Al Smith to run against Governor Miller . No other candidate was mentioned by any of the Tammany men . There is an aggressive and hopeful aspirant for the Gubernatorial nomination , however , in Bird S. Coler. " if Al Smith does not take it , it will come to me , " Mr. Coler recently predicted in talking to a friend . Democratic State Chairman Herbert C. Pell Jr . ' had a few minutes ' talk with Mr , Murphy late yesterday afternoon . He had nothing to say regarding candidates . Al Smith will leave for Atlantic City today and will not attend the big Jefferson Day dinner at the Hotel Commodore tomorrow night . Tammany Leader  --  Murphy , it was learned , will be at the dinner . Possibly because William R. Hearst had been overlooked when the invitations were sent out , Mayor Hylan has declined to accept an invitation . He was not on the list - of speakers , anyhow . These include , besides ex-Governor Tames M. Cox of Ohio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holt and Wilton Lackaye . Among the guests will be Democratic National Chairman Cordell Hull , Homer S. Cummings and George White . The dinner will see a reunion of many ardent supporters of Woodrow Wilson . Among those who have accepted invitations are Joseph P. Tumulty , Bainbridge ' by , John W. Davis , James W Gerard , Henry Morgenthau and Unitel States Senators Stanley of Kentucky and Overman or North . Carolina . .
