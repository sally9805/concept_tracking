Tensed like a tiger ready to spring , Super-Tuchun Sun Chuan-feng waited throughout the week with 40,000 soldiers mobilized at his stronghold in Chekiang Province , on the seacoast between Peking and Canton . <P> Sun , thus waiting , was playing the usual game of a Chinese Super-Tuchun when not actually at war . He was trying to decide which of two contending armies was the stronger , so as to throw his soldiers on the winning side . Hourly telegrams arrived from Super-Tuchuns Wu Pei-fu and Chang Kai-check informing Sun that each of these death-grappled war lords believed himself soon to be victorious , but would pay heavily and gladly for re-inforcements from Sun . <P> The scene of conflict was of course Hupeh Province , the stronghold of Wu . Against this base the Cantonese troops of Chang Kai-check , subsidized by Russian gold , have been making steady progress ( TIME , Sept. 13 et ante ) . They were reported last week to have driven Wu from Hankow on the Yangtze , but all information from the battle sector was admittedly untrustworthy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in the form of a telegram from Sun . He , having pondered well the strength of Wu and Chang , telegraphed Chang a 24-hour ultimatum to get out of Hupeh province and moved up like thunder from the coast with his troops to the aid of Wu.
