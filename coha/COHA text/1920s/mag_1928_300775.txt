Irish housewives bridled last week as gossips repeated to them a doctor 's scorn : " You will not in the length and breadth of the world fine worse cooking than in Ireland or a worse lot of housekeepers . " <P> The Women 's National Health Assn. had asked Dr. Louis Cassidy to talk at their recent meeting in Dublin , and such was his arraignment . He added : " The more you ponder , the more you come to the conclusion that many of the troubles of this country can be directly traced to two facts-there is too much tea and baker 's bread consumed and vegetables are hardly thought of . " <P> One rebuttal is that vegetables are too expensive in Ireland for the poor or ordinarily well-to-do . But the criticisms of poor cookery and housekeeping went uncontroverted . The women 's association has started to get better domestic science instruction in the Irish schools , to induce housewives again to bake at home .                  @ @ @
