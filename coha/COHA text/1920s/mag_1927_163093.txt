To the President at the State Lodge last week came Governor General of the Philippine Islands Leonard Wood . No other U. S. citizen has had so long or so distinguished a colonial career as General Wood , whom four Presidents ( McKinley , Roosevelt , Harding , Coolidge ) have placed to take charge of U. S. colonies. * Yet last week it was generally felt that the Governor General had come home to stay . For General Wood returned a sick man , his future career depending upon the decision of doctors whom he will later consult in the East . They will be called upon to consider the following disabilities : <P> Many years ago in Cuba a heavy chandelier fell on the Governor General 's head . It was said that the effects of this accident never entirely wore off . <P> As far back as 1920 General Wood walked with a slight limp , the result of a paralysis in his left side . <P> Within the past year the General has twice been operated on for hernia . <P> While on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wood was thrown to the deck by a sudden lurch of the boat ; refractured three ribs which he had broken in a recent automobile accident near Manila . <P> The eastern doctors may also be told that when General Wood left the train that brought him to Custer , S. Dak. , and entered the motor car that took him to the State Lodge , he had to be assisted by his aides . At the Lodge , attempting to show that he was still active , vigorous , the General rose from a chair , toppled suddenly , was prevented from falling when his two Filipino servants grasped and steadied him . <P> *Cuba , to be sure , is no U. S. colony ; but in the days following the Spanish War it was virtually on a colonial basis .
