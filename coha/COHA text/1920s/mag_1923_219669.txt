By provision of the Budget Act ( 1920 ) there is in existence the office of Controller General of the United States . He is appointed for 15 years and can be removed only by Congressional action . His business is to head the General Accounting Office which " controls the pulse beat of Federal expenditures . " What is more , he is empowered to exercise his functions " without direction from any other officer . " The occupant of this important office is J. R. McCarl , of Nebraska . <P> The object of Congress in creating this office was to keep in its own hands the control of Federal expenditures . The result is that there is now an executive officer who is not controlled by the Chief Executive . Already there have been several clashes between Mr. McCarl and members of the Cabinet . The latest of these is with Secretary of the Navy Denby , over what is of itself a comparatively minor case . <P> Mr. McCarl ordered the Navy Department disbursing officer to get back the money involved in an overpayment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objected on principle to this " interference " in his Department . Naval officers and enlisted men protest that Mr. McCarl , in effect , overrules formal naval orders . Mr. McCarl replied in a letter to Secretary Denby : " There was no authority in such Administrative powers as are given the head of the Navy Department to issue an order annulling a request of this office to protect the fiscal affairs of the United States . " <P> The Controller General also offered to send orders directly to the Secretary of the Navy instead of to the officers concerned . <P> Mr. Denby , however , objects to taking orders from Mr. McCarl and is prepared to take the case to Attorney General Daugherty for an opinion . If the Controller General is upheld , it means practically that there will be " two chief executives , " and in matters of expenditure , at least , Cabinet officers must acknowledge two superiors . <P> The Secretary of the Navy is not the only Cabinet officer to come in conflict with the Controller General . Before Mr. Fall retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow to Mr. McCarl on several occasions . Army officers have felt themselves abused in a number of instances by Mr. McCarl 's rulings . Evidently Mr. Denby now intends to force a " showdown " as to the scope of the Controller General 's powers .
