 | DURING the latter phase of the war , while I was flying with the Number One Australian Flying squadron in Palestine , a Handley-Page aeroplane was flown out from England by Brigadier - General A. F. Barton , C. M. G. , D. S. O. , A. F. C. , to take part in Allenby 's last offensive . It was intended that this monster aeroplane should be chiefly employed in carrying out active night bombing operations against the enemy . I hailed as good fortune the orders that detailed me to flv it . The remarkable success eventually achieved by this terrible engine of destruction , and its unfailing reliability during the ensuing long-distance flights , inspired in me great confidence and opened my eyes to the possibilities of modern aeroplanes and their application to commercial uses . A CHALLENGE IN JEST It is in a large measure due to the extensive experiences gained while piloting this Handley-Page machine that I was induced to embark upon and carry to a successful issue the first aerial voyage from London to Australia . In a lesser degree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Barton visited our squadron and informed me that he was planning a flight in order to link up the forces in Palestine with the army in Mesopotamia . He invited me to join him . There was a further proposal , that after reaching Bagdad we should shape a route to India , " to see , " as he jocularly remarked , " the Viceroy 's Cup run in Calcutta . " " Then , after that , " I replied . " let us fly on to Australia and see the Melbourne Cup , " little thinking at the time that I should ever embark upon such a project . Just after the Armistice was signed , General Borton decided to start out in the Handley-Page for India . MajorGeneral Sir V. G. H. Salmond . K. C. M. G. , C. B. , D. S. O. , commanding the Royal Air Force in the Middle East , would accompany us and carry out a tour of inspection . On November 29 , 1918 , we took our departure from Cairo , accompanied by my two air mechanics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. S. M. , and Sergeant W. H. Shiers , A. F. M. , both of No. i Squadron . It took just three weeks to pioneer a route to India , where we arrived , without mishap , on December to , i918. scarcely a month after the signing of the Armistice.  | Major - General Salmond was very proud of this achievement , for it demonstrated that the new arm of the service , the Royal Air Force , had begun to concentrate its efforts on peaceful developments and the establishment of longdistance commercial air routes . This was the longest flight that had ever been made up to this time , and it convinced me that a machine , properly attended and equipped , was capable of flying anywhere , provided suitable landing grounds existed . EXPLORING THE ROUTE After our arrival in India , General Barton communicated with the Air Ministry and asked for permission to charter a steamer to enable him to proceed to Australia to explore the route and arrange suitable landing grounds . I was to accompany General Borton on this expedition as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveying out the route , to return to India , join up with our machine , and continue the flight to Australia over the established course . The Air Ministry acceded to General Borton 's wishes , and the Indian Government accordingly placed at our disposal the R. I. M. S. Sphinx . On February to . 1919 , we sailed from Calcutta , our hold stowed tight with stores and equipment and 7,000 gallons of petrol . We intended to dump 200 gallons of petrol at each . landing place for the anticipated flight . But all our well-laid schemes ended in smoke . THE " SPHINX " BLOWS UP Two days later , just after leaving Chittagong , in East Bengal , our first port of call , the Sphinx caught fire and blew up .  | Drawn by A. H. Burnstead We narrowly escaped going up with it . We lost everything but our lives . After this mishap we were compelled to return to India to refit . The Indian Government generously lent us another vessel , the R. I. M. S. Minto . This time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success during the period of three months we were engaged upon it . We visited Burma , the Federated Malay States , the Netherlands Indies , Borneo , and Siam . Upon our return to India we were chagrined to find that our machine had been taken up to the northwest frontier to participate in a bombing offensive against the Afghans , and had been crashed in a storm . However , our heart-pangs were mitigated when we learned that the Australian Commonwealth Government had offered a prize of L10,000 for the first machine ( manned by Australians ) to fly from London to Australia in 30 days . Hearing this , I knew there would be many competitors , and the spirit of rivalry grew tense . It stimulated in me a keenness ? more than ever ? to attempt the flight . My difficulty was how to reach England in time . SECURING A MACHINE TOR AUSTRALIA Shortly afterward General Borton was instructed to return to London to report on the route . This opened the avenue of transport for myself and my two mechanics . General Borton himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , unfortunately , not being an Australian , he was debarred from entering the competition . He very kindly approached Messrs . Vickers Ltd. and asked them if they would supply a machine for  | the flight . This , at first , they refused to do , but after General Borton pointed out that I had already done a considerable amount of long-distance flying and had been over nearly the whole route , as well as assisted in pioneering it , they finally consented . My brother Keith was at the time in England awaiting repatriation to Australia . During the latter part of the war he had been flying with the Royal Air Force and had gained extensive and varied air experience . I therefore decided that he would be the best man to take as assistant air pilot and navigator . Sergeants Bennett and Shiers , in view of their excellent services and the knowledge of machines that they gained in the flight from Cairo to Calcutta , were to accompany us as air mechanics , thus making a total crew of four . Vickers did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until October , and as we left London on November 12 , it will be seen that the time to prepare for such an undertaking was very limited . Our preparations were doubly hurried , first by the knowledge that four other machines had entered the competition and were actually ready to start before the Vickers Company had handed over their machine to us , and .  | second , by the fact that winter was fast approaching and the season might break atanv time , thus rendering long-distance flying extremely hazardous . Once Vickers had decided to enter the machine , however , they threw themselves whole-heartedly into the project and practically gave me a free hand to make whatever arrangements I deemed essential . I had gone minutely into all the intricate details of equipment , the question of supplies , fuel , etc. , during my return voyage to England . The " Shell " Marketing Co. agreed to have our petrol supplies at the required depots to tabulated dates , and Messrs . Wakefield Ltd. in a similar capacity undertook to arrange for lubricating oils . MAPPING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roughly , England , France , Italy , Crete , Egypt , Palestine , Mesopotamia , Persia , India , Burma , Siam , Federated Malay States , Dutch East Indies to Port Darwin . With the route from Port Darwin to our ultimate destination we were unconcerned , for we had received intimation that the Defense Department of Australia had made all necessary arrangements . The great thing was to reach Australia , and , if possible , land our machine there under thirty days . For my convenience , I divided the route into four stages : First , London to Cairo ; second , Cairo to Calcutta ; third , Calcutta to Singapore ; fourth , Singapore to Australia . I had been over the entire route with the exception of the first stage , and so was fairly cognizant of the existing conditions ? the weather , climate , and the nature of the landing grounds . General Borton had pioneered the first stage in August , 1918 ; his generous advice , directions , charts , and photographs were invaluable .  | For the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as Calcutta , passable aerodromes existed , and I could rest assured of Royal Air Force assistance at almost every landing place . From Calcutta onward we would be entirely dependent on our own arrangements . I considered these last two stages the most hazardous of the flight . Owing to the dense jungles and rough ground , landing places were few and far between , and even those at which we contemplated stopping were very small and unsuited to landing a big machine . After leaving Calcutta , I proposed landing on the race-course at Rangoon , from which I would fly across the mountain ranges to the Siamese aerodrome at Bangkok . I then proposed to skirt southward down the coast of the Malay Peninsula to Singapore , where once more a landing would be made on a race-course . The next stop would be made at the hangars of the Dutch Flying School , near Batavia . There would then be no further aerodromes until Port Darwin was reached , a distance of 1,750 miles . I knew that the Vickers Vimy was quite capable of carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been demonstrated by the late Captain Sir John Alcock , K. B. E. , D. S. C. , on his famous transatlantic flight ; but I was also aware - at to attempt such a long flight with . igines that by that time would have , lone over Too hours running and cove red nearly 10,000 miles would be much t expect . I therefore decided that , in order to rake more nearly certain my chances of success , an aerodrome must be con ... meted midway . General Barton had selected an admirable site at Bima , on the island of Sumbawa , in the Dutch East Indies . If a landing could be made there , the long stage of 1,750 miles would be halved and the possibility of success more than doubled . A VALUABLE ALLY When on my previous visit to Java , I had had the honor of a lengthy interview with His Excellency the Governor-Genal . Count Van Limberg Stirum , concerning the aerodromes which General Borton and I were selecting in the Netherlands Indies for the proposed aerial route to Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial aviation , and I found him particularly well informed on all aerial matters . He also stated that any aerial route passing over the Netherlands Indies would receive his whole-hearted support and the assistance of his government . In the course of the conversation I mentioned that I hoped , personally , to attempt the flight from England to Australia a few months later . He said that he would be gratified to assist in any capacity . Remembering this while in London , I decided to ask His Excellency if he would prepare an aerodrome at the selected site al Bima , and sent off a private cable . LENGTH OF THE LONGEST NON-STOP STAGE REDUCED To 1,000 MITES Ten valuable days elapsed before I received a reply , but when it came I was overjoyed to learn that he was not only having Bima prepared , but also another aerodrome at Atambcea , in the island of Timor . This greatly eased my mind , for it meant that instead of having to accommodate our machine with a petrol capacity for 1,750 miles , we need only install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly added to the buoyancy of the machine , and , through the saving in space , to our personal comfort . The machine was an ordinary Standard Vickers Vimy bomber , similar to that used by Sir John Alcock for the transatlantic flight , and , apart from the installing of an extra petrol tank , we made practically no alterations . The machine was powered by two Rolls-Royce " Eagle VIII " engines , each of 36o horse-power . The wing-spread was a little over 67 feet and the total weight , loaded , was six and a half tons . Vickers ' factory , the home of the " Vimv , " is at Weybridge , about 20 miles distant from London , and is built by the side of the famous Brooklands Motorracing track . After completing the office work in London , the four of us moved to Weybridge and practically lived on the machine .  | The fitting , testing , and final adjusting were thoroughly interesting , and great enthusiasm was shown by the employees of Vickers . It was gratifying to observe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great machine flown by Sir John Alcock , felt that their efforts were something more than mere labor . They were producing an ideal from their factory to uphold national prestige . Every man and woman did his or her best , and wished us God-speed . Thus we were able to place the deepest confidence in the machine ; we feared no frailties in its manufacture , and hundreds of times during the flight we had occasion to pay tribute to and praise the sterling efforts of those British workers . Our petrol capacity would carry us for 13 hours at a cruising speed of 8o miles an hour ? ample for the longest stages between aerodromes . CUTTING DOWN THE BAGGAGE The question of " spares " was of vital importance and one into which I had previously gone minutely . As we intended starting almost immediately , I decided that it would be useless to ship " spares " ahead , so that the only course left was to carry them with us . This added considerably to the weight of the machine ; but the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might delay us for weeks , and so put us out of the competition .  | Eventually the spare parts , personal kit , and miscellaneous gear were assembled and weighed . I decided to limit the total weight of our machine when fully loaded to 13,000 pounds . I was aware that the deadweight of Sir John Alcock 's machine in the transatlantic flight was over 14,000 pounds . but in the vastly greater distance that lay before us , I intended to give my engines as little work as possible . We discovered that , after the " weighing in , " there was an excess of 300 pounds ; so something had to go . Our " spares " were indispensable , and so we drastically attacked our personal kit . It was easy enough to cut down our kit ? so soon as we were unanimous in deciding to go without any and so it eventuated that we left England in the garments we wore and with the proverbial toothbrush apiece . As my brother was navigator , all arrangements concerning maps , etc. , were left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our course by maps and direct observations of features on the ground ; but when cloudy or misty weather rendered terrestrial observation obscure , we would rely solely on navigation . For this purpose eye . carried an admiralty compass , a ground-speed and drift indicator , and we had our own flying experience to fall back on . DELAYED BY WEATHER The machine ryas at last ready , and , after being flown and tested by Sir John Alcock , was pronounced fit for the undertaking . I considered it advisable to remain another week in England in order to give our supplies of fuel and oil sufficient time to reach some of the more remote aerodromes . It was galling to have to idle in England while every day we read in the press of the progress of Monsieur Poulet , who had left Paris on October 14 and had by now reached Mesopotamia . The Sopwith machine , piloted by Captain Mathews , had also left England some time previously . The weather during this week 's stay was abominable . Winter was fast closing in with typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost without intermission . One after- noon there was a brief lull , and I managed to get the machine into the air for about an hour and make a final test . Our machine was still at Weybridge , and the official starting place for the competitive flight was the Hounslow aerodrome . " WE 'RE OFF ! " I had intended flying over to Hounslow on November 13 and starting off on the flight the following morning . On November i t we were pottering around our machine when the rain suddenly ceased and the fog lifted . It was too good an opportunity to miss ! We ran the machine out of its hangar , and I was just about to start up when the clouds closed down again and snow fell heavily . The weather was very capricious , for in half an hour the clouds rolled away , clearing the air and giving promise of a bright , fine evening . The engines were started up , we climbed into our seats , and took off from Veybridge . As far as we were concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hounslow the machine in every part worked to my entire satisfaction and we landed at the official starting ground without difficulty . Hounslow is the main " civilian " aerodrome of London , and all commercial machines inward and outward bound from or to the continent start from or land there . So soon as the machine was in its hangar , I got in touch with Vickers and informed them that I intended starting next morning . On the morning of November 12 we were called at 4.30 , and I was delighted to find a clear , frosty morning . However , at 6.3o a dense ground haze appeared , and weather reports sent by the Air Ministry forecasted bad weather in the southeast of London and the north of France . The machine was run out from the hangars and Commander Perrin , of the Royal Aero Club , marked and sealed five parts of it , in accordance with the rules of the competition . It was necessary to produce three of the marked parts upon arrival in Australia , in order to identify the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecast was Class V , or totally unfit for flying . This was not very reassuring , but our minds were made up and , come fair , come foul , we were determined to start . A few friends had gathered to bid us God-speed , and , with their kindly expressions and cheers sounding in our ears , we climbed into our seats and took off from the snow-covered aerodrome . THE RACE BEGINS IN EARNEST We climbed slowly upward through the cheerless , mist-laden skies , our engines well throttled back and running perfectly . So as to make sure that all was in thorough working order , we circled for ten minutes above Hounslow , then set off . At 2,000 feet we suddenly emerged from the fog belt into brilliant sunshine , but the world below was lost to sight , screened by the dense pall of mist . Accordingly , we set a compass course for Folkestone , and just before reaching the outskirts a rift in the mists enabled us to pick up the grand old coast-line , every inch of which is measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOOD-BYE , OLD ENGLAND ! There was a certain amount of sentiment , mingled with regrets , in leaving old England , the land of our fathers . Stormy seas were sweeping up channel , lashing white foam against the gaunt , gray cliffs that peered through the mists in the winter light , phantom-like and unreal . The frigid breath of winter stung our faces and chilled us through ; its garb of white had fallen across the land , making the prospect inexpressibly drear . The roadways , etched in dark relief , stood out like pencil-lines on the snow-clad landscape , all converging on Folkestone . I looked over the side as the town itself , which had played such an important  | part in the war , came under us . Thither the legions of the Empire , in ceaseless tides , had passed to and from the grim red fields of East and West , all acclaiming thy might , great land of our fathers ! It seemed hard to realize that we had at last started out on the long flight for which we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced over the machine-and the instruments , I wondered what the issue of it all might be ? if the fates would be so kind as to smile on us ever so little and allow us to reach the goal of our ambitions , Australia , in thirty days . The machine was flying stately and steady as a rock . All the bracing wires were tuned to a nicety : the dope on the huge planes glinted and glistened in the sunlight ; I was filled with admiration . The engines , which were throttled down to about three-quarters of their possible speed , had settled down to their task and were purring away in perfect unison and harmony . THE JOY OF FLYING A small machine is ideal for short flights , joy riding the heavens , or sightseeing among the clouds ; but there is something more majestic and stable about the big bombers which a pilot begins to love . An exquisite community grows up between machine and pilot ; each , as it were , merges into the other . The machine is rudimentary and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nervous system of the machine , through which the will of the pilot may be expressed ? and expressed to an finfinitely fine degree . A flying-machine is something entirely apart from and above all other contrivances of man 's ingenuity . The aeroplane is the nearest thing to animate life that man has created . In the air a machine ceases indeed to be a mere piece of mechanism ; it becomes animate and is capable not only of primary guidance and control , but actually of expressing a pilot 's temperament . The lungs of the machine , its engines , are again the crux of man 's wisdom . Their marvelous reliability and great intricacy are almost as awesome as the human anatomy . When both engines are going well and synchronized to the same speed , the roar of the exhausts develops into one long - sustained rhythmical boom ? boom boom . It is a song of pleasant harmony to the pilot , a duet of contentment that sings of perfect firing in both engines and says that all is well . This melody of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to probe the inscrutable future , as we swept over the coast of England at 90 miles per hour . THE WEATHER PROPHET And then the sun came out brightly and the channel , all flecked with white tops , spread beneath us . Two torpedoboats , looking like toys , went northward . And now , midway , how narrow and constricted the straits appeared , with the gray-white cliffs of old England growing misty behind , and ahead ? Gris Nez ? France , growing in detail each moment The weather was glorious , and I was beginning to think that the official prophet , who had predicted bad conditions at our start , was fallible after all . It was not until we reached the coast of France that the oracle justified itself ; for , stretching away as far as we could see . there lay a sea of cloud . Thinking it might be only a local belt , we plunged into the compacted margin , only to discover a dense wall of nimbus cloud , heavily surcharged with snow . The machine speedily became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goggles and the wind screen and covered our faces with a mushy , semi-frozen mask . Advance was impossible , and so we turned the machine about and came out into the bright sunshine again . We were then flying at 4,000 feet , and the clouds were so densely compacted as to appear like mighty snow cliffs , towering miles into the air . There was no gap or pass anywhere , so I shut off the engines and glided down , hoping to fly under them . Below the clouds snow was falling heavily , blotting out all observation beyond a few yards . IIOV AN AERIAL COURSE IS SET Once more we became frozen up , and , as our low elevation made flying extremely hazardous and availed us noth-  | ing , T determined to climb above the cloud-mass and , once above it , set a compass course for Lyons . Aerial navigation is similar to navigation at sea , excepting that the indispensable sextant is of little use in the air , owing to the high speed of travel and the consequent rapid change from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also to be made for the drift of the machine when side winds are blowing ? an extremely difficult factor to determine accurately . As the medium on which the machine travels is air , any active motion of that medium must necessarily have a direct influence on the machine . If , for instance , the medium on which we are traveling is a wind of 40 miles per hour , blowing directly toward our destination , and the velocity of the machine is 8o miles per hour , then the speed which the machine will travel in relation to the ground would be 120 miles per hour . If we had to forge directly ahead into the same wind , then our speed would obviously be only 40 miles per hour . To determine the speed of a machine in relation to the ground , an instrument is fitted , called a ground-speed indicator . In side winds the machine makes leeway in addition to its forward movement , and it is the ratio of the one to the other that provides the greatest problem of aerial navigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are obscured . On this particular occasion the Air Ministry had furnished us with charts indicating the trend of the winds and : heir approximate force at various alt , i:ndes , and so we knew , roughly , what allowances to make in our dead reckonng if we lost sight of the ground . INTO cLOUDLAND So we climbed steadily in a wide , assending spiral , until we reached an altitude of 9,000 feet , and were then just above the clouds . Below us the snowstorm raged , but we had entered another orld ? a strange world , all our own , with bright , dazzling sunshine . It might have been a vision of the polar regions ; it undoubtedly felt like it . The mighty cloud ocean over which we were scudding resembled a polar landscape covered with snow . The rounded cloud contours might have been the domes of snow-merged summits . It was hard to conceive that that amorphous expanse was not actual , solid . Here and there flocculent towers and ramps heaved up , piled like mighty snow dumps , toppling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so vast , that one 's sense of proportion swayed uncontrolled . Then there were tiny wisps , more delicate and frail than feathers . Chasms thousands of feet deep , sheer columns , and banks extended almost beyond eyereach . Between us and the sun stretched isolated towers of cumulus , thrown up as if erupted from the chaos below . The sunlight , filtering through their shapeless bulk , was scattered into every conceivable gradation and shade in monotone . Round the margins the sun 's rays played , outlining all with edgings of silver . A BEWILDERING SCENE The scene was one of utter bewilderment and extravagance . Below , the shadow of our machine pursued us , skipping from crest to crest , jumping gulfs and ridges like a bewitched phantom . around the shadow circled a gorgeous halo , a complete flat rainbow . I have never seen anything in all my life so unreal as the solitudes of this upper world through which , my companions and I were now fleeting . My brother worked out our course , and I headed the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went , riding the silver-edged sea and chased by our ( lancing shadow . For three hours we had no glimpse of the earth , so we navigated solely by our compass , hoping eventually to run into clear weather , or at least a break in the cloud , so that we might check our position from the world below . My brother marked our assumed position off on the chart , by dead reckoning , every fifteen minutes . The cold grew more intense . Our hands and feet lost all feeling and our bodies became well-nigh frozen . The icy wind penetrated our thick clothing and it was with greatest difficulty that I could work the machine . Our breaths con-  | densed on our faces and face-masks and iced up our goggles and our helmets . Occasionally immense cloud barriers rose high above the lower cloud strata , and there was no circumventing them : these barriers were invariably charged with snow , and as I plunged the machine into them , the wings and fuselage were quickly armored with ice . Our air-speed indicator became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accumulating layer of driving snow . Goggles were useless , owing to the ice , and we suffered much agony through being compelled to keep a lookout with unprotected eyes ? straining into the gomiles-an-hour snow-blast . A FROZEN LUNCH About i p. m . I suggested to my brother that we should have some sandwiches for lunch . On taking them from the cupboard we discovered they were frozen hard . Fortunately , we carried a thermos flask of hot coffee , and the piece de resistance was a few sticks of chocolate , which was part of our emergency rations . I have never felt so cold or miserable in my life as I did during those few hours . My diary is terse , if not explicit :  | " This sort of flying is a rotten game . The cold is hell , and I am a sill- ass for having ever embarked on the flight . " To add to our discomfort and anxiety , we were quite uncertain as to our location , and I had visions of what would happen if we encountered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic . The only really cheerful objects of the whole outfit were our two engines . They roared away and sang a deepthroated song , filled with contentment and gladness ; it did not worry them that their radiator blinds , which we kept shut , were thickly coated with frozen snow . I regarded those engines with envy . They had nice hot water circulating around them , and well , indeed , they might be happy . It seemed anomalous , too . that those engines needed water flowing around their cylinders to keep them cool , while we were sitting just a few feet away semi-frozen . I was envious ! I have often thought of that day since and smiled about it ? at that diary entry , and at my allusion to the two engines and my env . of their warmth . The situation was becoming desperate . My limbs were so dead with cold that the machine was almost getting beyond my control . We must check our position and find out where we were at any cost . A PASSAGE THROUGH THE CLOUDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver edges . It was symbolical : and when all seemed dark , this rekindled in me the spark of hope . By the side of the " cloud with the silver lining " there extended a gulf about two miles across . As we burst out over it I looked down into its abysmal depths . At the bottom lay the world . As far as the eye could reach , in every direction stretched the illimitable cloud sea , and the only break now lay beneath us . It resembled a tremendous crater , with sides clean cut as a shaft . Down this wonderful cloud avenue I headed the Vimy , slowly descending in a wide spiral . The escape through this marvelous gateway , seven thousand feet deep , that seemed to link the realms of the infinite with the lower world of mortals , was the most soul-stirring episode of the whole voyage . Snow was falling heavily from the clouds that encircled us , yet down , down eye went in an almost snow-free atmosphere . The omen was good : fair Fortune rode with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we picked out a fairly large town , which my brother at once said was Roanne . This indicated that we were directly on our route : but it seemed too good to be true , for we had been flying at over 8o miles per hour for three hours by " blind navigation , " and had been unable to check our course . THE END OF THE FIRST LAP At 1.000 feet I circled above the town . Our maps informed us it was Roanne ' . Lyons , our destination , was only 40 miles away . Exquisitely indeed is the human mind constituted ; for , now that we knew where we were , we all experienced that strange mental stimulus ? the reaction , after mental anxiety and physical tribulation . We forgot the cold , the snow , the gloom ; everything grew bright and warm with the flame of hope and success . And so eventually we reached Lyons and landed . I have always regarded the journey from Hounslow to Lyons as the worst stage of the flight , on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a day officially reported " unfit for all flying . " Furthermore , we had convinced ourselves that , by careful navigation , we could fly anywhere in any sort of weather , and , what was still more , we had gained absolute confidence in our machine and engines . byre were so stiff with cold when we climbed out of the machine that we could hardly walk . But what did it matter ? Our spirits ran high ; we had covered the worst stage ; the past would soon be forgotten , and new adventures lay awaiting us in the near , the rosy , future . The French flying officers were very surprised when they learned we had come from London . They looked up at the weather , at the machine , then at us , and slowly shook their heads . It was an eloquent , silent expression . They were still more surprised when they learned that we intended leaving for Rome the next morning . Not one of us could speak French very  | well , and we had considerable difficulty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by next morning . Sergeants Bennett and Shiers just had time to look over the engines before the winter darkness settled down . We all turned into bed very early , very tired , but very happy . On opening my personal kit that night I found it , too , had suffered the rigors of the sky journey . It was still frozen stiff ? my solitary tooth-brush ! THE SECOND DAY OPENS Next morning was November 13. always hold that such a date should be banned from the months of the calendar . Davlight 6.30 , cold and frosty . The petrol had not arrived at the machine , so sent my brother Keith in search of it ; his French was even less eloquent than mine . A couple of hours later he returned , looking very grim , followed by 300 gallons of very servile spirit . I explained in execrable French to a mechanic that I required 24 gallons of hot water for our radiators . It had been necessary to drain the water from the radiators the night before , owing to the low temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid block and burst the radiators . Ten minutes later the mechanic returned bearing a small jug of hot water . Our faces had been too sore to shave that morning , so I suppose he gathered from our appearance that we wanted the hot water for that purpose . My brother Keith then had a try in that Australian tongue , famed alike for its potency and rhetoric , and universally understood throughout the breadth of the battlefields . That mechanic bowed most politely and profusely and returned in great haste , bearing triumphantly a second jug of hot water . My brother 's growth , like his temper , is much more bristly than mine . While we both were  | literally " losing our hair , " my indispensable Bennett and Shiers had filled several petrol tins with water and had borrowed a large blow-lamp . Thus was the water heated and our tempers cooled . II . FROM LYONS-ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN-TO CAIRO We had planned overnight to leave Lyons immediately after an early breakfast , and we hoped to land at Rome well before the day closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , meant that we were not in the air till 10 o'clock . It was a frosty daybreak , and for a short time we encountered some clouds ; but as we progressed these drifted away , clearing the atmosphere and unfolding a scene of bewildering beauty . Eastward the Alps reared up , serrating the horizon with a maze of glistening snow-peaks . Seas of cloud filled the valleys , with innumerable dark , rocky pinnacles piercing through and giving the whole scene the appearance of a rock-torn surf . Charming villas , set amidst lawns and gardens , lay tucked away over the hillsides . White roadways streaked the landscape , and close by the coast ran the thin lines of steel along which a toylike train was passing with its burden of , sightseers to Monte Carlo and the playground of Europe . ACROSS THE RIVIERA The air was keen-edged and the cold was still severe , but after the icy blasts and the spear-pointed showers of the previous day . the going was excellent . We were freed , too , from the anxiety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map was no longer obscured . It lay unrolled below , an enlarged edition of our own tiny charts , on which we checked its features . Picking up the River Durance quite easily , we crossed it and passed above the city of Aix ; then swung east , heading for the st and Cannes ? across the famous iviera . Soon we caught sight of the sea . Five thousand feet below us the Mediterranean was laving the cliffs of innumerle little bays and inlets . embroidering thin white edging of surf round their @# rugged bases ? a narrow , white boundaryline separating green-topped cliffs from deep-blue waters . Nice soon lay below us . The city , with its fine buildings and avenues of palms , encircled by high hills , rests on the shores of a sea of wondrous blue . It is a place of ineffable charm and peace . A large crowd had collected on the Promenade des Anglais to witness our flight and cheer us up . We flew low enough to distinguish the doll-like figures , and though we could not return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onward again with a following breeze , white-cresting the blue sea that stretched away from beneath us to the southern horizon . We circled above Monte Carlo and the famous Casino , admiring the wonderful terraces and gardens , which looked like a skillfully carved and colored model rather than a real palace and its gardens . We swept round , looking for a landingplace , for I was inclined to test Dame Fortune and see if she would be as kind to us at the tables as she had been to us in the air . There seemed to be no suitable spot on which to land , however , so we headed on to our course again , and soon our regrets faded in admiration of the glorious coast-line over which we were speeding . Suddenly I remembered it was the 13th ; Fortune had been kind to us after all . FAREWELL TO FRANCE AT MENTONE ; ITALY 'S BORDER CROSSED Mentone , nestling in its bay , was the last glimpse we had of France ; then , stilt following the railway line that runs along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble from the customs officials . Less than half an hour later we passed San Remo , and , instead of following the coast-line north , I kept the Vimy headed almost due east , and , crossing the Gulf of Genoa , picked up the coast again at Spezia and turned south once more . Here we met a strong head wind , and this , added to the handicap of our delayed start , made it evident that we could not reach Rome before dark . I knew that there was an aerodrome at Pisa , since it was one of the stations on   the air route to Egypt , so decided to spend the night there and go on to Rome early next day . It was well down the afternoon when we picked out the aerodrome , and the ground looked very wet and desolate as w e circled above it . But we landed successfully through a whirl of mud and water , whisked up by the propellers . A CORDIAL WELCOME AT PISA As we taxied across the slippery ' drome toward the hangars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were profusely polite , and while our scholarship boasted " little French and less Italian , " there was no doubt about their cordial welcome and their curiosity . By means of that universal language of gesture , in which these Latins are so accomplished , they made us at home and indicated that an English officer was stationed in Pisa and that we might reach him by telephone . After considerable trouble I managed to have him called up and asked him to come down to the aerodrome . I was delighted to find that the officer was Captain Horne , of the Royal Air Force , who had been appointed to the air-route station . Accommodation for our party was promptly arranged , and after attending to the machine we motored into Pisa and stayed the night at an hotel . I l eavy rain set in , and when we were awakened in the morning it was still pouring , with a strong slant from the south . In spite of the unsuitable conditions , we decided to go down to the aerodrome and , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On our arrival at the hangars we  | found , to our dismay , that the aerodrome looked more like a lake than a landing ground . However , I started up the engines and endeavored to taxi into the wind , but the machine became badly bogged , the wheels refusing to budge an inch . A force of thirty Italian mechanics came to help us , but it took us an hour and a half to extricate the machine . Our difficulties in getting anything like " teamwork ' ' were increased by our lack of knowledge of Italian , and Sergeant Bennett amused us greatly by breaking into Arabic , with all the French he knew sifted in . A second attempt also resulted in failure , and by the time the machine had been dug out I came to the conclusion that it was hopeless to try to leave that day . It was still raining , so we covered up the engines and reluctantly returned to the town , soaking wet and grimed with mud . SEEING PISA Late in the afternoon the rain ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited the usual hackneyed tourist sites , including the famous Leaning Tower . Elections were in progress and the whole town was swayed with excitement . We attracted much attention walking about in uniform ; for , besides Captain Horne , we were the only British officers in Pisa . BENNETT 'S FLYING LEAP We were cheerful , for we had hopes that the water would drain off the aerodrome by the following morning , but once more we awoke to disappointment . Drizzling rain and a cold south wind ushered in the new day . However , we went down to the aerodrome , determined to get the machine into the air somehow . My brother and I walked over the aerodrome , stamping in the mud to try to find a hard track for the machine . We got very wet , but managed to find a pathway with a fairly hard surface . All went well until I swung the machine round , just preparatory to opening the engines full out for getting off . In doing this sharp turn , one wheel became a pivot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly bogged . Our  | Italian friends came to the rescue again , and bv digging and pulling got the machine out of the hole which it had made for itself . The ground was so soft that the wheels began to sink iii slowly , and I realized that if we were to get off at all it must be at once . I opened out the engines , but the machine would not move forward , as the wheels had become embedded in the mud ; on the other hand , the tail lifted off the ground and there was the danger of the machine standing up on its nose . To overcome this difficulty . Sergeant Bennett applied the whole of his weight on to the tail-plane , and I once more opened the engines full out . Some of the Italian mechanics pulled forward on the wingtips , and this time the machine started to move forward slowly . I suddenly realized that Bennett was not on board . but as I had got the machine moving at last , I was afraid to stop her again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow , as I had previously told him that as soon as the machine started to move he would have to make a flying jump for it or else take the next train to Rome . We gathered way very rapidly , and , after leaving the ground . I was delighted to see Sergeant Bennett on board when I looked round . The take-off was very exciting and hazardous , as the A-imy had to plow her way through soft mud and water . The water was sucked up and whirled around by the propellers , so that we became soaked through and plastered with liquid mud . I am sure that in a cinema picture our performance would resemble the take-off of a seaplane more than that of a land machine rising from an aerodrome . We were tremendously relieved to find the freedom of our wings again , and though we laughed at our discomfiture , it was certainly a providential take-off and one that I should not care to repeat . We afterwards learned that we had been doubly lucky , for the rain continued to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporarily impossible . A ROUGH PASSAGE , ' Our flight toward Rome was one long battle against heavy head winds and through dense clouds . We had been in the air barely an hour when the oil-gauge on one of the engines dropped to zero . Thinking that something had gone wrong with the lubricating system , I switched off this engine and flew along close to the ground on the other engine , looking closely for a place to land . Fortunately we were not far from the Italian aerodrome at Venturina , and there I landed . Sergeant Shiers quickly discovered that the fault was in the gauge itself , and not in the lubricating system , and it was only a matter of minutes before we were in the air again . The wind had increased , and the rest of the voyage to Rome was boisterous and unpleasant . Our average ground speed was a bare fifty miles an hour . so that it was not till late in the afternoon that we were above the city of the Caesars . STIRRED BY THE BEAUTY OF ROME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day and our eagerness to get down to earth , I could not help being stirred by the beauty of the historic city . The sun was peering through the space between the clouds and the distant mountain tops and , slanting across the city , gave it an appearance of majestic splendor . In this soft evening light , Rome reflected something of its old glory . Details were subdued , so that much of the ugliness of its modern constructions was softened . Below , " the Yellow Tiber , " spanned by numerous bridges , curved a silvery course out into the twilight and to the sea . In the brief space of a few minutes we had circled the city within the walls , and it was with feelings of relief that we landed at the Centocelle aerodrome . A hospitable welcome was accorded us by the commandant of the Italian Flying Corps and by the British air attache . The latter kindly attended to our wants . had a military guard placed over the machine , and acted as interpreter . -f fy original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Rome to Athens , thence to Cairo in another flight . This decision was the result of a report received in England that the aerodrome at Suda Bay , on the northern side of  | Crete , was flooded and would be unfit for landing till after winter . The air attache at Rome , however , told me that the Suda Bay ' drome was still in good condition , but that I could make sure by dropping down at Taranto and inquiring at the British aerodrome there . A glance at the map will show that the Cretan route saves a considerable distance , Suda Bay providing a half-way house . I therefore decided at once to take the Taranto course and try to save the long stretch of Mediterranean from Athens to Cairo . HOW WE FAILED TO " SEE NAPLES AND DIE " After daylight , we left Rome in very bad weather . Our route for the first few miles followed the Appian Way , and as we were flying low we had a fine view of this ancient highway . The landscape for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rifts we had fleeting glimpses of the wild and spectacular nature below us . Naples was not directly on our course to Taranto , but having visited it previously as a tourist , I made a detour in order to photograph and gaze down upon its wondrous bay from the sky . To my intense disappointment , clouds and mist robbed us of my desire , and even the mighty Vesuvius was buried somewhere beneath the sea of clouds ; so , reluctantly , I turned away and resumed our course to Taranto . Our course now lay almost due east across the Apennines ; but here again the clouds had banked against the mountains , and only an occasional peak peered through them . Owing to the clouds and my scant knowledge of the country , I determined to fly low , following , more or less , the course of the valleys , which were nearly cloud-free . From breaks in the cloud , the sun beamed down on to vales of great loveliness . Numerous small waterfalls dashed down the mountain sides , and streams like silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps of the mountains were terraced , and wherever a flat stretch of soil presented itself small homesteads nestled , surrounded by cultivation . Sometimes we would be only a few hundred feet above the ground when crossing the crest of a ridge ; then we would burst out over a valley several thousand feet deep . Flying became extremely difficult at this stage , owing to the bumpy nature of the atmosphere . At times the machine was literally tossed about like a leaf . and for three-quarters of an hour we experienced some of the roughest flying conditions of the whole journey . On one occasion our altimeter did a drop of 1.000 feet , and bumps of 400 and 500 feet , both upward and downward , were frequent . I can only attribute this aerial disturbance to the rough nature of the country and the proximity of clouds to the mountain tops . A strong following wind was blowing , and I was very much relieved when we got clear of the mountains and were following the coast down to Taranto . THE HEEL OF ITALY The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A great number of ships and transports were anchored off shore , and as the air had now cleared somewhat , we had a glorious view of this great Mediterranean seaport , which played such an important part in the Eastern campaign . We could still discern long lines of tents in the British camp . and everywhere there was the great activity which characterizes a military center . The town is small and picturesquely situated at the head of a little inland bay , which forms a magnificent natural harbor . Below us the boom protecting the  | entrance from submarines was clearly discernible . When we landed we were greeted by a number of officers of the Royal Air Force who were stationed there , as Taranto at that time was one of the main aerodromes on the route from London to Cairo . The machine was pegged down and lashed , and after an excellent lunch at the officers ' mess we spent the afternoon working on the engines and preparing for the flight across the sea to Crete the following day . The British camp was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a fine garden with the chrysanthemums in full bloom . Here I met many old comrades with whom I had been associated during the war . This meeting was a pleasant relaxation from the mental strain of the past few days , and I gleaned much valuable information about the aerodrome at Suda Bay . I was delighted to learn that it was still in good condition and was in charge of Royal Air Force personnel . This information finally decided me to cancel the idea of flying on to Athens . I now determined to fly on to Suda Bay , thus cutting the long sea flight of the Mediterranean into two shorter sections and saving upward of 200 miles . After a good night 's rest in comfort-  | able beds , we were up at our usual hour and made an early start for Suda Bay . Once again the weather was cruel to us . First , we flew east to the heel of Italy , and then headed across the open sea to the island of Corfu . Low cloud and rain forced us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was miserable . The driving rain cut our faces and obscured all distant vision . Almost before we realized it , Corfu loomed up in the mist , and so I altered the course to southeast and flew down the coast of Greece . The bad weather made our voyage down this rugged coast very hazardous , and on one occasion , after passing through a particularly low bank of cloud , I was terrified to observe a rocky island loom up in the mist directly ahead . It was only by turning sharply at right angles that I avoided crashing the machine against its precipitous sides . All this time we were flying at a height of no more than 800 feet , and so it was with intense relief that we reached Cape Matea , the most southern point of Greece , and headed across the sea to Crete . The clouds now lifted , and the mists dissipated , unfolding a scene of rare enchantment . The high ranges of Crete soon loomed up before us . A layer of cloud encircled the island like a great wreath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coasts , rocky and surf-beaten , could be seen below . All this , set in a sea ' of wondrous blue , bathed in bright sunshine , lay before us . It was a gladsome and welcome sight . Wheeling above the town of Canea , which is on the opposite side of a narrow neck to Suda Bay , we soon located the aerodrome and circled above it preparatory to landing . THE LAND OF ' HISTORY AND LEGEND The aerodrome is not of the best and is rather a tricky place for negotiating a landing , being surrounded on three sides by high , rocky hills ; but we succeeded in making a good landing . Here , too , we were welcomed by an officer of the Royal Air Force and a small crowd of inhabitants , who gathered round the machine , examining it ? and us ? with curious interest . With the knowledge that on the mor- row our longest oversea flight , in this half of the voyage , awaited us , we spent most of the afternoon in a particularly thorough overhaul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. friend 's invitation to look over the town and take tea at his house . We found Canea to be an extremely picturesque and interesting old place . Its massive castle walls , its narrow , cobbled streets , and its quaint , old-fashioned , but substantial , buildings , reminiscent of a bygone age , are all in keeping with its history , which runs back of the Christian era , and its legends , which run back a league or two further . Our pilot excited our admiration by the expert way in which he steered us through a maze of rough-surfaced alleyways , our Ford causing a great scattering of children and dogs ? both of which appear to thrive here in large numbers . AN ATTACK OF " PRICKLY HEAT " Eventually he conducted us to a quaint little cafe ? a sort of tavern , at which the people seem by custom to foregather for a cup of coffee before dinner . The cafe-au-fait was excellent , and , as our host racily recounted his experiences , I came to the conclusion that life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensations , and is not nearly as dull as it appears at first glance . The short run home to our R. A. F. friend 's house was certainly not monotonous , but we arrived undamaged and undamaging . Since the house was rather small to accommodate unexpected guests , we cheerfully agreed to sleep in the small British hospital close by . We turned in early , planning to take a good night 's rest and get away betimes in the morning . A few minutes after putting out the lights , I heard my brother heith tossing about in bed , and called out to know if anything ailed him . " Yes , " he said , " I fancy I 'm getting prickly heat . " A few minutes later I got a touch of it myself , and , bounding out of bed , reached for the candle . The beds were full of prickly heat ! " Prickly heat " held the fort in large and hungry battalions . We retreated and spent the night curled up on the floor of an adjoining room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been raining heavily and the air was still thick with drizzle . The prospect was not good for crossing the island , which , though only a few miles wide , is intersected by an irregular range of mountains , of which the famous Mount Ida is one of several peaks . But , with our experience of the muddy aerodrome at Pisa fresh in our minds , we decided to get aloft as soon as possible rather than risk the ground . which was already becoming soft . degenerating into a bog . THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN PASS We took off quite easily , and soon after leaving the ground encountered a layer of cloud , but pushed through and out ? only to find ourselves beneath another stratum . Our charted route lay southeast , then south , with the southernmost point of the island as the objective , and I had been told that it was easy to follow a rough track leading from Canea through a pass in the mountains but , with clouds above and below , it was not so easy . I decided to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the necessity of climbing above the mountains , and so wasting valuable time . Fortune favored us . I found the pass and to my joy discovered that there was just sufficient room for us to scrape over the top without entering the cloud . We appeared to be only a few feet above the rocks when we cleared the crest , but it was preferable to having to barge blindly through the clouds , running the consequent risk of hitting a mountain crag . On the southern side of the ranges the air was much clearer . and we were soon flying over the coast-line . We took observations and set a compass course for Sallum , on the African coast Two hundred and fifty miles of open sea had to be crossed . Be-  | fore we started , Bennett and Shiers had given a final look over the engines , which had been running perfectly , and almost the last thing they did before climbing aboard was to inflate the four spare inner tubes of our landing wheels ; they would make first-class life-buoys if we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have preferred flying at about 5,000 feet , but our enemies , the clouds , which ever harassed us , forced us to fly at an altitude of from 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the face of the sea . There was a light , favoring wind , and the going was smooth and even ; but as the land dropped behind , and mile after mile was flown , one began to realize the meaning of the term , " a waste of waters . " On and on we flew , yet , save for the wind of our own passage through the air , could scarcely tell that we were moving ; for , unlike the flight across the land and down the seacoast , there was nothing by which to gauge our movement . The cloud roof was dull and uninteresting ; the sea-floor gray , desolate , and empty as far as the eye could reach . SHIPS OF THE SEA LEFT FAR BEHIND My brother took out his case and began writing letters . I studied the charts and the compass and kept the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right of the course , appeared a minute object that separated into two as we drew nearer , and finally resolved itself into a pair of vessels linked together with a towline . Very tiny they looked down there and very lonely . We were heading for Sallum , on the African coast , 25o miles from Crete , as the ' plane flies . 1 wondered if these ships were making the same port , and how long it would take them to do the journey that we were counting on accomplishing in about four hours ! I felt quite sorry for the poor midgets toiling along with their tow-rope , and speculated on what would happen if a big sea got up . Doubtless they looked tip at us ? they must have heard our engines booming ? and wondered , too . Perhaps they envied us our wings ; perhaps they pitied us and congratulated themselves on the sound decks beneath their feet . Ten minutes and they were far behind us ; another ten and they were out of sight ; but they had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only speck of life we saw on all that area of waters . Once more we entered the loneliness of sea and sky , but we had the sense of having passed a definite point , and now we kept a keen lookout for land . ON AFRICAN SHORES Our first glimpse of Africa was of a barren , desert coast-line , but it was a welcome sight none the less . On reaching Sallum we turned and flew along the coast as far as Mersa Matruh . The land below was flat and uninteresting desert , with nothing to relieve the monotony . Without landing at Mersa Matruh , we headed direct for Cairo , across the graybrown sea of sand , passing over Wadi Natrum , which is merely a cluster of straggling palms beside a salt-pan . We were not sorry to descry those landmarks of the ages , the Pyramids , and soon we could pick out the minarets and mosques of the Egyptian capital itself . Now we were winging our way over Old Father Nile and across landmarks that were as familiar to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was guiding the Vimy . No wonder I glanced affectionately over the silent engines as we came to rest . I felt extremely happy as we sat there a moment or two , waiting for the fellows to come up and welcome us . We had come through from Suda Bay , a distance of 68o miles , in a non-stop flight of seven and a half hours , thus completing the first and worst of the four stages into which I had divided the total journey . THE LAST STAGE That bit of route from London to Cairo ? pioneered in 1917 by my old commanding officer , General Bortonhad taken its toll , and I had been more than a little afraid of it on account of the possibility of bad weather and my ignorance of the country and the aerodromes . And here we were , safe , with our machine as sound as when she started . A familiar stage , with all the prospects of fine weather , lay before us . There was some excuse for a flash of thankfulness and exultation . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was from men with whom I had served during the war . Our mechanics , too , found old comrades who hauled them off to celebrate the occasion before attending to the engines . It was quite like old times to climb into a car , to spin through well-known thoroughfares to Shepheard 's , to sink luxuriously into the arms of a great and familiar lounge chair , and to yarn over the events that had happened since last I occupied it . A NIGHT IN CAIRO My friends tried to persuade me to attend a dance that was being held there ' that night , but I needed all the sleep I could get , and so declined reluctantly . But for an hour or more I sat in an easy chair on the well-known veranda , listened to the sweet strains of the music inside , and that other strange blend of street cries a veritable kaleidoscope of sound that may be beard nowhere save in Cairo . I noted , too , the beauty and the chivalry coming in , and watched the curious procession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be assured that it was not a splendid and fantastic dream . As we lounged there a messenger boy brought a cable for me ? we had sent our own messages off long before . It was from General Borton , congratulating us on our safe arrival in Egypt and wishing us good luck for the next stage . While I was reading this kind remembrance from my old O. C. , an Arab paperboy came crying his wares , and I bought a news-sheet and read with amused interest the story of our doings during the last few days . I also read , with a shock of keen regret , of the accident that had befallen our gallant competitors , Lieuten-  | ants Douglas and Ross , who had both been killed practically at the starting-post , lust a few days after we left , through the crashing of their machine . Then we turned to the column that recorded the progress of Monsieur Poulet , who had left Paris thirty days before and who , we saw by the cables , was now in India . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he still held a big lead , and we were keen to get on with die next stage . We turned in that night feeling happier and more rested than at any moment since we left England , and ? e slept like proverbial tops . III . FROM CAIRO ACROSS PALESTINE AND MESOPOTAMIA We had intended staving a few days Cairo to rest , but , owing to the day e lost at Pisa , we were now one day behind our scheduled time ; so I decided that it must be made up . There had been a heavy fog overnight , and on our arrival at the aerodrome the weather conditions were not at all enticing . Telegraphic reports from Palestine indicated " Weather conditions unsuited for flying . " LEAVING EGYPT My inclinations wavered . We were at a hospitable aerodrome , surrounded by old friends ; rain had-begun to fall and we were all very tired . The Vimy , however , had been overhauled the night before and everything stood ready . Perhaps at the end of the journey- we would be more limb-weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the venture ; so I made up my mind to proceed . We took off from Heliopolis aerodrome with the cheers of my old war comrades sounding above our engines . For fifty miles we followed the Ismailia Canal to Tel-el-Kebir . The banks were bordered  | by a patchwork of densely cultivated and irrigated lands ; beyond , arid barrenness , sand , and nothing . On the canal the great white lateen sails of dhows and feluccas in large number resembled a model yacht regatta . It was all very beautiful and wonderful . Northward the waterways , canals , and lakes of the Nile delta stood out like silver threads woven around the margins of patches in a patch-quilt , for the sun had now burst through the clouds , and all the world sprang into life and light . From aloft , without the sun , the world is a gloomy-looking place , doleful and dead . Over the famous old battlefield of 1882 ? Tel-el-Kebir ? where Arabi Pasha suffered ignominiously by the valor of British arms , even now there is a camp of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canal that  | links north with south ? a straight cut of deep-blue water , running to the horizon transversely to our course ? and ahead the gray desert sands , only limited by the ' flue sky . Below , a P. and O. steamer , heading south , passes down the Suez Canal . Perhaps she is bound for Australia ; she will call in at Adelaide , my home and destination ! With a smile , I contrasted the old and the new methods of transportation , and a throb of exultation thrilled us all . Still , we wondered ? unspoken the thoughts ? who would reach Australia first . Kantara now lay below us , that vast series of store-dumps ? a mushroom city beneath canvas ? which had sprung into being since the British occupation of Palestine , and from which practically all commissariat and munition supplies were drawn . As we passed over Kantara , feelings of confidence , mingled with no small satisfaction , filled me . We were now entering upon country I knew as well as my own homeland , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Light Horse before I started flying ; furthermore , I had been over the entire air route which now lay before us , as far as Java . A BRIGHT PROSPECT The section from Hounslow to Cairo I had always regarded with some trepidation , on account of the winter storms and bad weather . Now we could look forward to improving atmospheric conditions and good aerodromes as far as Calcutta at least . This enabled us to view more rosily the ultimate issue . Kantara soon lay beyond the rolling eternity of sand which all who served through the rigors and privations of the desert campaign call " Hell . " It was somewhere in these regions that the Children of Israel wandered for forty years . Forty minutes in the grimy was quite  | sufficient for us . We looked down upon that golden sea of desolation , with only here and there a solitary clump of date palms that boasts the name oasis , and we felt very sympathetic toward the Children of Israel . Two things alone stood out clearly in the wilderness ? the iron way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kantara to the fighting front , and the line of water-main beside it . We were flying at an altitude of 1.500 feet , so that it was possible to pick out all details readily . As we passed over the old battlefield of Romani . I picked out my old camping site and machine-gun nests . THE AIR LINE , ACROSS PALESTINE El-Arish , Rafah , Gaza ? all came into being ; then out over the brim of the world of sand . Gaza from the air is as pitiful a sight as it is from the ground . In its loneliness and ruin , an atmosphere of great sadness has descended upon it . On the site of a once-prosperous town stands war 's memorial ? a necropolis of shattered buildings . The trenches before Gaza and on the hill Ali Muntar looked  | as though they had been but recently vacated . Next we passed over the Medjdel aerodrome , and as I gazed down at the marks where the hangars had stood . many memories of bygone days came pleasantly back to me . Soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching Ramleh heavy rain began to fall . There was an R. A. F. squadron station on the old aerodrome , and I was sorely tempted to land and renew old friendships , for I had been stationed at this aerodrome for five months at the latter etld of the war . However , this was no joy-ride : so I reluctantly passed over this haven of refuge , and then once more out into the bleak world of storm and rain : but I was much cheered by the whole squadron turning out on to their aerodrome and waving up to us . THE ENGINES ' SONG My past experiences in Palestine rainstorms steeled me for what was to follow . and from Ramleh to the Sea of Galilee the weather was despicable and smote us relentlessly . The torrential rain cut our faces and well-nigh blinded us.  | We were soaked through and miserably cold . One thing only comforted me , and that was the merry song of the engines . Whether " in breeze or gale or storm , " they heeded not . On through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times of warmth and sunshine , singing their deep-throated song ? " All goes well ! " Fortunately I knew the country very well , for after passing Nazareth I had to follow the winding course of the valleys , owing to low clouds , until the Jordan was reached . The River Jordan presented an extraordinary sight . The main stream has eroded a narrow channel between wide banks , down which its waters meander in an aimless way , zigzagging a serpentine course across a forbidding plain of great barrenness and desolation . A narrow green belt , somber in color as age , pursues the river through the Jordan Valley , which for the greater part is an arid waste , speckled with sparse and stunted shrubs . The river enters the Dead Sea at nearly 1,300 feet below the level of the Mediterranean . TRAVELING Ix THE AIR BELOW SEA-LEVEL The Sea of Galilee is , roughly , 700 feet above Dead Sea level , and , as we were flying 500 feet above the river , most of our journey through the Jordan Valley was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean . On reaching the Sea of Galilee the weather improved . As we passed over the great lake , where deep-green waters rest in a bowl encompassed by abrupt hills , strange emotions passed over me , for below us lay a hallowed place ? a scene of ineffable charm , peace , and sanctity . I now headed the Vimy northeast for Damascus and climbed up to 5,000 feet . Occasional cloud patches passed below us , but the landscape for the most part was drear and featureless , save for a line of snow-clad summits that lay away to the north , Mount Hermon and the AntiLebanon Mountains . The flight through Palestine had been an ordeal ; extreme weariness gripped us all , for we were still soaking wet and very cold . Then once more joy filled our thankful hearts when our straining eyes picked up Damascus , a miraged streak on the horizon of a desert wilderness . The streak became irregular . It grew into a band assuming height and breadth , minute excrescences , and well-defined contours . Color crept in ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from out the waste of sands , an oasis , glorious , magical , enchanting ? this was Damascus . A city almost ethereal in its beauty , rearing a forest of slender minarets and cupolas , surrounded by dense groves and woods , had sprung into being , as if by magic , from the Syrian desert . WE LAND IN DAMASCUS Although one of the world 's most ancient cities , age has dealt lightly with Damascus . From the air it appears no older than the blaze of poplars and cypresses that features the gardens and shades the sun-baked mud-houses and mosques . Beyond the city , beautiful gardens and glades extend , gradually dwindling and blending into the desert spaces . To the north and west rise the multicolored foothills of the Anti-Lebanon Mountains , flanked by the higher peaks with radiant snow mantlings . Damascus invited and offered a haven of rest . Great was our joy on touching the ground ; greater still to be welcomed by old comrades , and to be cared for . The Vimy , too , was looked after . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I overhauled the controls , and my brother Keith filled up with " shell , " to be ready for an early start on the morrow . A NIGHT IN OLD DAMASCUS After attending to the machine , we drove in another machine ? a Ford ? into Damascus and took lodgings at the leading hotel , where the fare was excellent and sleep undisturbed by the parasites common to the country . Damascus is wholly Oriental , though in many ways it is adopting Western fashions and customs . Trains run in the city , and though their speed harmonizes with the indolent habits of the Orient , they seem strangely out of place , as also does the electric light , that sheds its beams of searching and misplaced effulgence in the bazaars and  | squalid stalls , where shadow , deep shadow , is essential to effect a successful sale . I looked out of my window before turning in . A myriad spires , misty and intangible , pointed to a heaven brilliant with stars ; a faint breeze drifted in from the desert . The atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The skies promised sunshine , and henceforth the weather would be good ! Conceive my dismay when , on awakening with the morning , I discovered heavy rain falling ; still further was I dismayed to find the aerodrome surface rapidly becoming soft , and the wheels of the Vimy = sinking in . As there was no sign of the weather clearing up , we greased our tires to assist their passage through the sticky clay , started up the engines , and , to my unspeakable relief , the Vimy moved ahead . But the take-off was not lacking in excitement . The propellers sucked up water and mud , whirling it in all directions ( we happened to be included in one of them ) , and so we rose into the air , once more to be cut by the lash of the elements . To my intense relief , the storm did not extend more than a score of miles beyond Damascus . A MUD VILLAGE ON PALMYRA 'S RUINS We were now heading for Tadmur again the desert extended before us ? a rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction to speed at eighty-five miles per hour . Tadmur is a miserable village of mud huts that has sprung up amidst the noble ruins of ancient Palmyra . The modern bazaars are built for shelter among the ancient columns and fragmentary walls of the Temple of the Sun . These magnificent ruins are the bleached skeletons of a glorious past . austere and dignified even in the squalor and meanness that surround them . From Tadmur the route lay east to Abu Kemal , on the Euphrates . Shortly after leaving Tadmur we observed an encampment consisting of several hundred black goat-hair tents , and gathered around them were vast herds of camels . As we were flying low at the time , our sudden appearance caused a stampede , not only among the beasts , but also the occupants of the tents . They decamped , evidently terror-stricken . We subsequently learned that the camels were the spoils of a victorious raid . Perhaps the raiders thought we were the judgment ! FOLLOWING THE EUPHRATES On reaching Abu Kemal we turned southeast , following clown the course of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interminable desert , to pursue the lazy course of the great river and to pass again over fertile tracts and numerous villages . The most remarkable of these villages is Hit , not only on account of the ancient city which lies buried here , but because there are several bitumen springs , from which this valuable commodity oozes in vast quantities . Practically every native who owns a boat on the Euphrates has copied Noah , who was commanded to " pitch the ark within and without with pitch . " On leaving Abu Kemal we encountered strong head winds , which diminished our speed considerably . I was becoming anxious as to whether we could reach Bagdad before ( lark , as I was not keen to make a night landing there . The sun was fast sinking in the west , and as eye flew over Ramadie it dipped below the horizon . I decided that there would not be time to do the forty miles to Bagdad before dark . We selected a suitable landing ground among some old trenches , close to a cavalry camp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battlefield , which was one of the notable sites of the Mesopotamian campaign . Soon after landing the C. O. of the Indian cavalry regiment came out to greet us , and proffered the hospitality of his camp . We were delighted to learn there was a small supply of aviation petrol here , and we obtained sufficient to carry us through to Basra without having to land at Bagdad . An Indian guard was mounted over the machine , and the Vimy was securely lashed down for the night . The O. C. of the loth Indian Lancers and his staff were thoroughly pleased to meet us. and over the excellent dinner that was prepared I told the latest happenings in London ? their home . They were a fine , stout-hearted lot of fellows and greatly we appreciated their hospitality . We felt truly sorry for them , stationed in such a remote , isolated place as Ramadie . A BLOW IN THE NIGHT About 11 o'clock that night a heavy windstorm swooped down upon us , and my brother and myself rushed out to the machine . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the tail of the machine . The Vimv was in imminent danger of being blown over and crushed . We turned out fifty men from the nearest camp . They hung on to the machine until we started up the engines and swung her head round into the wind . It was a pitch-dark night , and the gale whirled the sand into blinding eddies . cutting our faces and eyes . One very  | severe gust caught one of the ailerons and snapped the top balance-wires . This allowed all four ailerons to flap about in a very dangerous manner , and it looked as though they would all be wrenched off before we could secure them . By weight of arms , however , we eventually managed to secure the ailerons before serious damage was done . At last the machine was turned , facing the wind , and in that position successfully weathered the storm . Throughout the rest of the night the guard hung on to the machine and all stood by . REPAIRING THE DAMAGE The storm abated by morning . We found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sand had choked up everything exposed to the weather , and by the time the damage had been repaired and our tanks filled with Petrol it was noon . For the first time since leaving London we had promise of a good flying day with a following wind . This good fortune atoned for our troubles of the night and for our lack of sleep . We were - weeping along at Too miles an hour , and m less than thirty minutes Bagdad lay below . Glorious old Bagdad ! Bagdad today , faded of all its old glory , is a place of poverty and decay , alluring only through name and association . Yet , in spite of its meanness and squalor , the magic city of Haroun-al-Raschid , the hero of the Arabian Nights , of Aladdin , and Sindbad the Sailor , shall remain immortal . OVER THE GARDEN OF EDEN It is hard to believe that the land above which we were now speeding was once the garden of the world . Oh , where is thy wealth and prosperity , fair Babylonia ? Despoiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted by the accursed methods of the Turkish Government , it seems incredible that this void of marsh and waste land was once a country of milk and honey , a land of pomp and luxury that led the civilization of the world . From a height , the aspect of Bagdad is more inviting than from the ground . A maze of narrow streets , wandering through a tesselated plan of flat roofs , of spires and green splashes of cultivation and date palms , of a great muddy brown river , covered with innumerable little round dots , which on closer investigation resolve themselves into circular , tublike boats ? all this is Bagdad , and the impression is pleasing and reminiscent of bygone glory . A LAND OF MEMORIALS There is but one thoroughfare that stands preeminent today in Bagdad ? a wide road which the Turks had cut through the city to make way for the retreat of their routed army before the victorious British under General Maude ; and so now may we see the dawn of a new era and fairer days ahead for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we were passing was a measure of history of valorous effort , mighty deeds , and heroism . The map of Mesopotamia unrolled before us . Here lay the old battlefields of Ctesiphon , Laff , Tuba , the trench systems still being clearly observable . Kut el Amara , where was enacted the most dramatic and heroic episode of the Mesopotamian campaign , next came into view . For five awful months that little garrison of British men , led and cheered by their beloved general , had held out against the Turk , disease , and the pangs of starvation . The glorious story of the defense of Kut and the surrender is one of those splendid episodes that thrill the heart of every Englishman , and which shall live immortal with the memories of Lucknow , Delhi , Khartoum , Ladysmith , and 1fafeking . IV . CHASING POULET ACROSS PERSIA AND INDIA In describing Mesopotamia I am inclined to quote the terse , if ineloquent , account of the British Tommy who wrote of it : " A hell of a place , with two big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yet the possibilities of development are infinite and the potentialities golden ? a land of suspended fertility , where animation and prosperity lie for the time dormant ? a wondrous garden , where centuries of neglect and rapine have reaped desolation and bar-  | renness . The land is athirst , but the two great rivers , the Tigris and the Euphrates , move sullenly on , ebbing their life out to the sea . Turn back these tides into the veins of irrigation and the land will be replenished , Eden shall be again , and even the valley of the Nile shall be despised to it . Exulting in the fair weather and following breeze , we swept over the world at zoo miles an hour . Three thousand feet below , the two great rivers conflux and unite in the Shatt-el-Arab , with the miserable village of Kurnah at the junction a village built of mud , and its humanity of the same color as the turbid streams that bear the soil of Asia Minor away to the Persian Gulf . Clusters of date palms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond a half mile or so there is nothing but the dun-colored wilderness , the miraged sky-line , and the blue canopy where the sun rules king . All this once was the Garden of Eden . Today it is not a delectable site ; but who may speak of the morrow ? The waters of the Shatt-el-Arab , heavily impregnated with mud , resemble the outflow from a mud geyser , swirling and boiling ; they move oozily forward as their caprice inclines , the silt is precipitated , shallows form , mud-banks come into being , grow into islets , and disappear with the next flood . BASRA , A HIVE of ACTIVITY The flight from Bagdad to Basra took just under three hours . The crazy river barge , probing its way through shallows , rips , and mud , generally takes a fortnight ! Basra we discovered to be a hive of activity . It was the main shipping port during the Mesopotamian campaign , and a large military base and aerodrome were still in evidence . The aerodrome stretches to the horizon , and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see pages 271-273 ) . We crossed over to the town in one of the characteristic river boats called mahailas ? a Viking vessel strangely and crudely carved at prow and stern , and with sails as multi-patched as the garments of the crew . The town is an unlovely place of strange and variodorous perfumes ; so after dispatching mails we hastened back to the Vimy . As there was a Royal Air Force depot here , I decided to delay a day and allow Bennett and Shiers to overhaul and adjust the engines . A LONG DAY 'S FLIGHT On the morning of November 23 we made a daylight start for Bander Abbas , 65o miles south . Soon after starting , the sun came up from the distant hills ; the world threw off its somber gray , and in dawn 's fair raiment became beautiful . The delicate shades of pink that flushed the horizon mounted higher and higher until the zenith grew gay ; and so another day of the flight had begun . The sunlight sparkled on our varnished wings , and the polished propellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merrily . The Vimv ceased to be a machine and pulsed with life , as if feeling the glory of the morning ; my brother scanned the landscape below , plotting off the course on the chart and checking our position from time to time by villages and salient features , remarking how wonderfully accurate the world was created ! Bennett and Shiers had stowed themselves away in the after cockpit and were reclining inside the fuselage with the spare parts , endeavoring to secure wellearned rest from their strenuous efforts of the past few days . As the spare parts crammed all available space , theirs was painful comfort indeed . The dimensions of our front cockpit were of those adequate proportions generally attributed to wedges . The weather continued fine , but for the most part the flight was uninteresting and monotonous . We passed over Bushire and several coastal villages , but the only really impressive sight was the ruggedness of the coastal belt and the hinterland ranges . Some of the country presents a remarkable sight , and appears as if a mighty harrow had torn down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razorbacks rise precipitously from deep valleys barren of vegetation and desolate of life . Occasionally w e passed over small flat plains dotted with abrupt hills and flat tabletops . The whole earth appeared as though some terrific convulsion had swept it and left  | in its wake this fantastic chaos of scarred mountains and gouged valleys . DOWN THE PERSIAN GULF TO BANDER ABBAS In striking contrast , the shores of this wild scene are washed by the stagnant waters of the Persian Gulf . The color ation of this phenomenal panoi ama was equally bewildering . The dead expanse of the Persian Gulf , mingled with the mud of the rivers , was an exquisite shade of green , patched here and there with darker areas , where the wind had caught it up into ripples . Mountainward , the first impression was that all had been molded in yellow clay . A closer survey showed streaking , ' and strata of infinite shades , of which the rust color of ironstone appeared dominant . : At intervals the dry beds of waterways cut well-marked defiles from the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding through the maze and seeming as if blasted out by the hand of man . Throughout this terrible country I scarcely observed a possible landing ground , and had our engines failed us it mould have ' meant either crashing or else an immersion in the Persian Gulf . it was with no small relief that I brought the ' imy to a safe landing at Bander Abbas , where a hearty welcome was extended to us by the British Consul , the Persian Governor , and a great concourse of interested natives . Although dog-tired , I could not sleep that night . The coming day 's trip , I hoped , would enable us to reach Karachi in a non-stop flight of 730 miles . The distance did not perturb me in the least , but the treacherous country and the isolation from civilization in case of a forced landing . and another long stretch of detestable mountain-scored country was in itself enough to give one a nightmare . The British Consul had prepared an ostentatious-looking document which eye were to carry . It commanded the murderous tribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case we were compelled to land among them ! Fortune favored us once more with a following breeze and excellent weather . The country was a repetition of that passed over the previous day , and , with the morning sunlight striking aslant , heavy shadows gave the scene the semblance of a mighty rasp . The engines were perfectly synchronized , and roared away harmoniously ; but it is imperative for the pilot to watch every part of his machine , especially the engines . As I sat there hour after hour , I found myself automatically performing the same cycle of observation over and over again . My supreme difficulty was to keep my sleep-heavy eyelids from closing and my head from nodding . First of all I would look at my starboard engine and see that the oil-pressure gauge and revolution counter were registering correctly ; then listen to hear if the engine was firing evenly . Next , glance over the engine and oil-pipe connections and check off the thermometer which indicated the water temperature iii the radiators . The altimeter , air-speed indicator , and petrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look up to the port engine and go over the instruments and engine as before ; then over the side to scan the landscape , and ever keep an alert eye for a suitable spot in case of a forced landing . Bv the time I had completed this performance it would be time to start all over again . When flying over interesting country the monotony of this ceaseless routine is relieved , but where flying over country such as the present stage the only mental stimulus that buoyed us up was the anticipation of rosier times ahead . Often our thoughts were of Poulet , who was somewhere ahead , and we wondered if ever we would catch up with him . ENTERING THE AERIAL GATEWAY TO INDIA AFTER A 730-MILE FLIGHT Frequently we passed over small villages , and our advent instilled terror into the inhabitants and their animals . For the last Too miles we left the coast and flew on a compass bearing direct for Karachi , and so we entered the aerial gateway to India after a non-stop flight of eight and a half hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refilling our  | tank with petrol had to be carried out before we could seek rest . This took from three to four hours ; and as we had a flight of 750 miles to do in order to reach Delhi next day , it was necessary for us to put 369 gallons of " shell " into the machine . This petrol was in four-gallon tins , which meant that we had to handle , lift up . and filter ninety tins , or well over a ton of petrol ( see page 233 ) . NO ROMANCE IN POURING PETROL My brother and I generally filled the tanks , while Bennett and Shiers worked on the engines . It was not much fun . after piloting the machine for eight and a half hours in the air , to land with the knowledge that we had to lift a ton of petrol , besides doing innumerable small jobs , before we could go off to rest . In addition , we had to run the gauntlet of functions and ceremonies , and it was difficult to make folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciated every one 's generous kindness , but I fear that on some occasions people must have thought me very discourteous . The first news that greeted us on landing at Karachi was gratifying . Poulet was at Delhi , only a day 's flight in the lead ! This was a great surprise , for we fully expected that he would be well on his way to Singapore . From now onward added zest would be given to the flight , for I intended to pursue the chase in keen earnest . Already I considered the race as good as won , for the Vimy was superior both in speed and range . We had hoped for a good rest at Karachi . but the local Royal Air Force officers had arranged a dinner , and it was not before " the very witching hour " that we turned to bed . Three hours and a half later we were called to continue the flight . This was to be the longest non-stop we had undertaken . Nine hours ' flight should land us in Delhi , 75o miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned east . heading straight into the golden sun that was just rising above the horizon . A low ground haze that changed into a golden mist as the sun mounted higher hid the earth from view . Pass- ing over Hyderabad , the vapors rolled away and we had a grand view of the River Indus . Once more we entered the monotony of the desert . For the next three hours we flew steadily onward , pursuing the railroad track across the dreary Sind Desert . It was a joy to reach Ajmere , a delightful little city , beautifully situated in a basin of green hills . The country beyond is for the most part flat ? a vast verdant carpet irrigated from the great rivers . Practically from the time we had reached the African coast , when on our way to Cairo , the flight had been across deserts or desolate lands . Now the new prospect that opened ahead invited and attracted . During the afternoon flying conditions became very boisterous , and the turbulent atmosphere tossed the Vimy about like a small vessel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome diversion , for the flights of the past few days had cramped me in one position , and now I was kept actively on the move keeping the machine straight and fighting the air-pockets and bumps into which we plunged and fell . DELHI IN THE DISTANCE We first noticed Delhi from fifty miles distance ? a white streak in a haziness of green plain . Quickly details became apparent , and soon the streak had germinated into a considerable town . I circled above Delhi to allow the people to see our machine , which had established a record by arriving thirteen days after leaving London ? a distance of 5,870 miles . We climbed crampily out of the machine and were welcomed by General McEwan , the Royal Air Force chief in India , and many other old friends . I regretted that I was quite unable to reply to their kindly expressions , as I did not hear them . The roar of the exhausts for nine consecutive hours ' flying had affected my ears so that I was quite deaf . After several hours my hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the same morning for Allahabad . Great excitement prevailed , for one aeroplane had departed and another  | had arrived on the same day , both engaged in a race half-way around the world ! After attending to the machine we ( lined at the R. A. F ' . mess , thoroughly tired but extremely happy . Nalf the journey was completed and Poulet was within range . FROM BASRA TO DELHI We had left Basra at 6 a. m. on November 23 and arrived at Delhi fifty-four hours later , covering a distance of 2,100 miles . Out of the fifty-four hours we had spent twenty-five hours ten minutes actually in the air , and in the balance we had overhauled the engines and machine twice , and had by our own efforts filtered two and three-quarter tons of petrol into the machine . I had intended pushing on to Allahabad next day , but on arrival at the aerodrome we were feeling the effects of the past strenuous days so severely that I decided that rest was imperative . We took it - in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good hours on the machine , made every- p 300 thing ready for an early morrow start . Toward evening my brother and I drove into the city sight-seeing . As I had been to Delhi during my flight to Calcutta with General Borton , I played the guide , and an enjoyable ramble through this future capital diverted our thoughts from the Vimv for the moment and enabled us to relax . Further diversion , with less relaxation , was provided by the native driver of a car we hired . In the language of the realm in which we had been living , he navigated full out and nearly crashed us on several occasions , in his desire to show what a pilot he was . I declare that I " had the wind up " far more often on this bit of journey than during the whole flight . However , the casualties were few and the fatalities nil , and we paid him off at the R. A. F. quarters . At 4.30 next morning I tumbled stiffly out of bed on the insistence of a Yankee alarm-clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others had uncoiled and emerged into the early Indian dawn ,  | I felt again the keenness of the chase . A friendly R. A. F ' . pilot came up in a Bristol fighter and flew with us for a few miles along the course of the Jumna . Half an hour later the oil-gauge surprised us by setting back to zero , and we made an unexpected landing at Muttra , to find that it was happily only a minor trouble ? the slipping of the indicator on its spindle . And so into the air once more , and on to Agra ? Agra the city of the Taj Mahal . Of all the remembered scenes , wonderful and beautiful , that of the Taj Mahal remains the most vivid and the most exquisite . There it lay below us , dazzling in the strong sunlight ? a vision in marble . Seen from the ground , one 's emotions are stirred by the extraordinary delicacy of its workmanship . Viewed from 3,000 feet above , the greater part of its infinite detail is lost , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfectly  | We hovered lazily around , exposed our photographic plates , and swung off on our course . In the vastness of space through which we were speeding , the magnificent monument became a toy . . a mote . . . a memory . New scenes , villages , and towns rose from the unreachable brink ahead , grew into being , passed beneath , then out over the brim of the world behind us . We were crossing the vast plains of central India , a great flat tessellation of cultivated patches that gave an impression of the earth being covered with green , brown , and golden tiles . These multitinted patches were framed with brimming channels carrying the irrigation waters from the great river . A BULL . ATTACKS THE VIMY Allahabad was reached after four and a half hours , and we eagerly but vainly searched the aerodrome for a glimpse of Poulet . There were several hangars on the aerodrome , however , and we thought that his machine might be under cover .  | On landing we were informed that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable garrison stationed at Allahabad , and the commandant , fearing that a deformity- might overcome us through being cramped hand and foot in the machine , had arranged an active function called a jazz . Unfortunately , we were unable to test the efficiency of this form of exercise , though we appreciated the thoughtful hospitality of our hosts . There was great excitement at the aerodrome next morning . While we were taxi-ing to the far end , preparatory to taking off , a fine bull broke on to the ground , and as we swung round to take off he charged head on toward the machine . The position , though ridiculous , was extremely hazardous . No doubt , to quote the celebrated railway engineer , it would have been had for the coo , " but a collision would also have been extremely " bad for the Vimy . " I frightened him for the moment by a roar from the engines . Evidently he took the roar for a challenge , and stood in front of the Vimy , pawing the ground and bellowing defiantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd to move the monster , and , much to the amusement of ourselves and the crowd . the bull changed his intention and turned on the hero . Our brave toreador retreated to the fence , pursued by the bull . the ARRTV L AT CALCUTTA We took advantage of the diversion and made a more hurried ascent than usual . What became of the scout I do not know , but as we circled above I noticed that the bull was still in sole possession of the aerodrome . Once more pursuing the course of the  | Jumna as far as Benares , we headed southeast and followed the railroad to Calcutta . Forty miles north of Calcutta we came above the River Hooghly . Here and there factories and jute mills came into view , with villages clustering around them . The villages grew dense and became the outskirts of a great and expansive city ? a mighty congestion of buildings , white , glaring in the sun : green patches and gardens , thoroughfares teeming with people , a vast fleet of shipping , of docks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thousands of people had collected on the race-course , at the far side of the city , to witness our arrival , and when we landed it was with great difficulty that  | the police kept back the multitude of natives that surged around the machine . A barrier was at last placed around the Vimv , and soon we became the center of a compact mass of peering faces , all struggling to get closer and obtain a better view . The elusive Poulet , we learned , had moved off the same morning for Akvab . PAST THE HALF-WAY MARK That night , after the usual overhaul of engines and filling up with petrol , we stayed with friends and slept well . We had crossed India and were now more than half-way to Australia . Our departure next morning from Calcutta was marked by an incident that to the layman may sound insignificant , but it might easily have spelled disaster to us . Thousands of natives and a great many distinguished white people came down to see the start . The race-course is really too small for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety , and I was a trifle nervous about the take-off ; but the surface was good , our engines in fine trim , and she rose like a bird . A NARROW ESCAPE FIROM DESTRUCTION 111 HAWKS Then came our narrow escape . A large number of kite hawks were flying round , alarmed by the size and noise of this new great bird in their midst . When we had cleared the ground by about tell feet two hawks flew across us at an angle ; they seemed to become confused and turned straight into us , one striking the wing and the other flying straight into the port propeller . There was a crash as if a stone had hit the blade , and then a scatter of feathers . It may not sound very dreadful ? except for the hawk ? but as a matter of fact it was a breathless , not to say a terrifying , moment , for we fully expected to hear the crash of broken propeller blades . We were at the time flying straight for the high trees , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a terrible crash . However , more hawks were circling about , and in endeavoring  | to avoid them I almost crashed the machine on the tree-tops . By a very narrow margin indeed we cleared them , and I was deeply relieved when we had climbed to 1,000 feet and were clear of the pestilent birds . I marveled that our propeller stood the impact , for a very trifling knock will cause the disruption of a propeller when running " full out , " and so in an extremely high state of tension . ( I have known so tiny an object as a cigarette end thrown carelessly into a propeller to cause the whirling blades to fly to pieces ! ) On looking over the machine I noticed one of the hawk 's wings had become pinned in the rigging , and we secured it after the day 's flight as a souvenir of a hairbreadth escape . Calcutta marked the completion of the second stage of our journey , and from now onward the route would be much more difficult and hazardous . We had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every landing place , but henceforth we would have to land on race-courses or very small aerodromes . Also , I knew that the only possible landing places right on to Port Darwin were at stated places hundreds of miles apart , and that in the event of engine trouble our chances of making a safe forced landing were very slender .  | I had originally intended flying from Calcutta to Rangoon race-course in one flight , but as the next day , November 29 , was a Saturday , and I was informed that a race meeting would be held at Rangoon on that day , I decided to stop at Akyab . We were now passing above a dreaded span of country , the sundarbans , where engine trouble would have meant the undoing of all our efforts and labor . The mouth of the Ganges here frays out into a network of streams , producing a jigsaw of innumerable islets and swamps . We breathed much more freely after we had reached Chittagong , a place I had reason to remember well , through having spent four days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire and was blown up ( see page 230 ) . From Chittagong we followed the coast - line of Burma , and eventually reached Akyab . My brother peered over the side as we circled above the aerodrome and showed symptoms of great excitement , while Bennett and Shiers waved joyfully from their cockpit and pointed down to the ground . They indicated a small machine near the center of the field . It was Poulet ! V . THROUGH CLOUD AND MONSOON TO SINGORA Poulet was the first to greet us on landing . He came forward with a cheery smile and outstretched hand ? a true sportsman , the hero of a gallant and daring enterprise . I was deeply interested in inspecting Poulet 's machine , which was drawn up alongside the Vimy . In Proportion , the contrast was reminiscent of an eagle and a sparrow . The Vimy towered above the tiny Caudron , which appeared altogether too frail and quite unsuited for the hazardous task these two courageous fellows had embarked upon . I had a long talk with Poulet and his mechanic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that theirs was a novel and exciting method of touring the globe . We agreed to fly on together the next day to Rangoon , but when morning arrived , as we still had some work to complete on the machine , Poulet set off , and by the time we were ready he had an hour 's lead . No aeroplane had ever landed at Rangoon before , and naturally I was very keen to win the honor for the Vimv . For the first too miles I followed the coast-line southward and did not observe a single landing place in case of necessity . The coast , for the most part , fringes out into vast mangrove swamps . while farther inland the country becomes mountainous , with rice-fields checkering the valleys and every available irrigable area . The hills are densely wooded and very rugged . Flying east , we crossed a low mountain chain , and on the other side found the Irrawaddy River . We followed down its course as far as Prome . From here the railroad guided us on to Rangoon . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a green patch framed by a compact ring of cheering humanity . THE RACE TO RANGOON We came to earth midst tempestuous cheering , and were welcomed by the Lieutenant - Governor of Burma . Sir Reginald Craddock . and Lady Craddock . We were told that no race meeting had been so well attended as the present , nor had the betting been so widespread . The multitudes had massed to witness two aeroplanes racing half-way across the globe . To them the race was more than novel ; it was a great event in their lives , for few indeed of the vast assemblage had ever seen an aeroplane . As flying conditions from Akyab had been boisterous , we in our high-powered machine had a great advantage over Poulet , and in spite of the hour 's handicap at the outset . we succeeded in reaching Rangoon an hour ahead of him . Poulet 's arrival was the signal for another burst of cheering , and he was welcomed no less warmly than ourselves . The police experienced great difficulty in clearing the race-course that evening , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intent on holding a festival for the duration of our stay . I was told that when the first news of our departure from London appeared in the local papers , and the fact that we intended calling at Rangoon became known , a large crowd of natives straightway as-  | sembled on the race-course , expecting to see us arrive in a few hours . Later , when the news of our reaching Akyab was noised abroad , a multitude camped overnight on the race-course , so as to make sure of witnessing our arrival . A GOOD OMEN That night we were the guests of Sir Reginald and Lady Craddock , who did everything possible for our comfort and insisted that we should go to bed early . It was the first time such a suggestion had been made to us , and , as we were very weary , we deeply appreciated their kindly consideration . There is a strange lizard in the East which makes a peculiar noise . like " tuktoo , " and it is a popular superstition that if one hears this sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , just before going to our room , a lizard " tuk-tood " seven times . The omen was good and we slept peacefully . We had arranged with Poulet to start off together next morning and keep company as far as Bangkok . The Wimp- was considerably faster than the Caudron , but by throttling down and maneuvering , it would be possible to keep together . The way to Bangkok lay across high ranges and dense jungle , and the mutual advantage in making the journey together over this unfrequented and practically unknown country , should a forced landing have to be made by one of us , was obvious . Traffic fills the highways before sunrise in the East , and a considerable portion of it was moving toward the racecourse . A great crowd of interested natives swarmed over the aerodrome , and the police and troops were already busily engaged clearing them off prior to our departure . We started up the engines , took leave of our kind friends , and waited for Poulet . Poulet had some 1 difficulty with his machine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to get hot , I took off , intending to circle above the aerodrome until Poulet arose on the wing . The take-off was not without a thrill . As a matter of fact , to this day it is a mystery to me that we ever left the ground . The race-course was much too small for so large a machine as the Vimv and heavily laden as it was . It had barely attained flying speed when a fence loomed up in front of us . The Vimy just scraped over , but ahead were trees and buildings . I acted instinctively . The undercarriage brushed the tree-top , and danger was past . It was over in a breathless moment ; but had the machine been but a single foot lower , disaster must have overtaken us . How slender is the cord that holds success from failure ! I circled above the race-course for twenty minutes ; but , as Poulet had not yet left the ground , I concluded that he must be experiencing engine trouble , and so reluctantly we had to push off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortalized in Kipling 's famous ballad , " On the Road to Mandalay , " and as no aeroplane had ever flown above this land before , Sergeant Shiers , in words worthy of the great poet , said it was fine to be flitting through air that had never smelt a blanky exhaust ! LOST IN CLOUDS ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS The maps we carried of this country were very poor and sadly lacking in detail , but they indicated that a 7,000-foot mountain range had to be crossed before reaching Bangkok . After leaving Moulmein we headed southeast over country rapidly becoming mountainous ; but , instead of encountering lofty summits , a mighty cloud bank , that seemed to reach to heaven and bar the entire prospect in the direction , of our course , extended before us . The monsoon season was now due , and I concluded that this would be one of the initial storms . Somewhere in that dread barrier lay the high peaks over which we must cross , and I admit that I was afraid of the prospect . As time wore on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I decided to plunge ahead . The clouds rested down to 4,000 feet , and we were flying just beneath them . Somewhere ahead lay the mountains that had to be crossed , rearing their summits another 3,000 feet higher . Our maps indicated a pass which we tried to find , and so we started off along a deep valley . At first it looked hopeful , but after five min-  | utes ' flying the cliffs narrowed in , and , fearing I might be trapped in a tapering dead end , I turned the - imv about . There was just sufficient room in which to effect the maneuver . After a consultation with my brother , we agreed that our safest course was to climb above the cloud-mass or at least to an altitude sufficiently high to clear the mountain tops , and barge our way through the mist . At 9,000 feet we emerged above the first layer ; but eastward the clouds appeared to terrace up gradually , and in the distance there extended still another great wall , towering several thousand feet higher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before starting off over this sea of clouds , my brother took observations with the drift indicator , and we found to our dismay that we would have to fight into a twenty-mile-an-hour head wind . He gave me the compass bearing to fly on , and away we went once more , with the world lost to view beneath us . It reminded me of our first day over  | France ; but the weather was not so cold , so we felt physically more comfortable . The map showed the range to be about fifty miles wide , and after we had flown for half an hour . still another cloud barrier appeared directly ahead . Our machine had now reached its " ceiling , " so there was no alternative but to plunge ahead into the mist . We were then flying at an altitude of 11,000 feet , and were soon engulfed in a dense blanket of mist . As we had left England hurriedly , there had been no time to fit special cloud-navigating instruments , and the only ones we carried for this purpose were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any one who has flown through clouds in a big machine , under similar circumstances , will appreciate my feelings at this time . Down below us lay jagged mountain peaks buried by cloud . Ahead , around , and behind , the mist enfolded us in an impenetrable screen , and if I once allowed the machine to get beyond control , a horrible fate would be waiting for us all below . WHAT FLYING IN CLOUDS MEANS To those who have not experienced the anxiety of cloud-flying , I will attempt to describe briefly what happens . The moment one plunges into heavy cloud there is misty blankness ; all objects are lost to view ; and as time wears on , a helpless feeling grows upon one that all sense of direction is lost . To overcome this predicament , I was provided with the aforementioned instruments , and settled clown to try to watch all three at once and maintain their readings correct . In addition it was necessary to glance over the engine and the gauges continually . At first all went well ; but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unconsciously , with the natural movement of my body , pushed one foot , which was on the rudder bar , slightly forward . This turned the machine off its course , and when next I looked at my compass I was ten degrees off course . I then kicked on the opposite rudder to bring the machine back ; but , as the Vimy is much more sensitive to respond than the comparatively sluggish compass-needle , I found that I had put on too much rudder . The result was that when the compassneedle started to swing it did so through an angle of forty-five degrees . In my attempt to correct the course and bring the needle back on to its correct reading , I glanced at the air-speed indicator and found it registering over one hundred miles an hour ? twenty-five miles above normal flying speed . This meant that I must have pushed the nose of the machine down . The inclinometer indicated that the machine was not flying laterally correct in fact , we were flying at an inclined angle of forty degrees . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I did not get matters righted at once , the machine would get out of control and go spinning down to earth . LONG AND ANXIOUS MOMENTS It is useless attempting to describe how I acted . A pilot does things instinctively , and presently my instruments told me that we were once more on our course and on an even keel . All this took but a few seconds ; but they were anxious moments , as a single mistake or the losing of one 's head would have been fatal . This happened several times , and at the end of what seemed hours I glanced at my watch and found we had only been in the clouds for twelve minutes ! Perhaps my nerves were a little ragged , owing to strain and lack of sleep during the past fortnight ; but I felt at last that anything would be better than going on under these tense and nerveracking conditions . It was now an hour since we first started across the clouds , and both Keith and I concluded that we must surely be across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go lower and " feel . " Shutting off both engines , we glided down , and I held up the machine so that we were going as slowly as possible -- only about forty miles an hour . The sensation was akin to the captain navigating a vessel in uncharted shoaling seas ? expecting every moment to feel a bump . Lower and lower we went ? ten , nine , eight thousand feet ? and then we both anxiously peered over the sides ? straining for a glimpse of hidden peaks .  | As we approached the 7,000-foot level , which I knew to be the height of the range , we huddled together and held on tight , in anticipation of the crash ! I noticed a small hole in the cloud , with something dark beneath . It was past in a flash , but instantly I pushed the throttle full open and flew level again . At first I thought it was the top of a dreadful peak , but on further consideration I remembered that in my brief glance the dark patch had looked a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more I shut off and went lower . and as we had not hit anything by the time we reached 4,000 feet , I concluded that the range had been crossed . A few minutes more and we burst out into full view of a glorious world , carpeted with trees , 1,500 feet below . The sudden transformation was stunning . It was an unspeakable relief ? the end of an hour that was one of the veriest nightmare experiences I have ever passed through . Before our bewildered gaze there stretched a dark-green forest , only limited by the distant skyline . Here and there the dark green was splashed with patches of bright-colored creeper , and in spite of the fact that there was not the vestige of a possible landing place , it was beautiful and a welcome relief . Later , the Siamese told us that all this country was unexplored . The country now began to fall away gradually to the east : the hills became less rugged and petered out into undulating , yet heavily wooded . jungle . An hour later and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Small villages lay scattered along its banks and wide expanses of irrigated lands verdant with rice crops . Following downstream , we landed at  | Don Muang aerodrome , twelve miles north of Bangkok , after a flight that will live long in my memory . Don Muang is the headquarters of the Siamese Flying Corps . They have several hangars , a number of machines . and up-to-date workshops . During my visit to Siam the previous year I had been to Don Muang , so that on landing I found myself among friends . We were met by the British Consul General , Mr. T. H. Lyle , with whom I had stayed on my previous visit and who now rendered us valuable and appreciated assistance . The Siamese also displayed the warmest hospitality , and the commandant very kindly placed his own bungalow at our disposal . It was found necessary to regrind the valves on two of the cylinders of the starboard engine : and , as this was a lengthy job , Bennett and Shiers worked all night to complete it , so that we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp was rigged up over the engine , and all the flying ants and insects in Siam collected around it , which greatly added to the discomfort and hindrance of the work . My original plan was to fly from Bangkok to Singapore , roughly 1,000 miles , in one flight ; but as I learned there was a good aerodrome at Singora , about halfway , with 500 gallons of petrol depoted there ? and as I was anxious to reserve the machine as much as possible . I decided to land at the latter place . We left Bangkok in good weather , and were escorted for the first fifty miles by four Siamese machines . For the first hour the flying conditions were ideal , with a good following wind helping us : then ahead again lay our old enemies , the clouds . At this time we were living along the coast , so did not deem it necessary to climb above them . The clouds became lower and heavier and soon we found ourselves only 1,000 feet above the sea . CAUGHT IN A MONSOONAL STORM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to come . While we were over the sea , with the land on our right , there was comparatively little chance of our crashing into anything . This was fortunate , for in a few moments we were soaked through , our goggles became sat- urated , and all vision for more than a few hundred wards or so was obliterated . The rain came down literally like a sheet of water , and , as we had to remove our goggles and maintain a constant lookout ahead , we were almost blinded by the rain lashing our unprotected eyes . At this time ewe were doing ninety miles per hour , and as the torrential rain clashed against us and the machine it pattered and smote like hail . Narrowing my ewes down to slits , I peered out ahead as long as I could endure it ; that was but a few minutes . I then tapped Keith to keep the watch while I rested my eyes ; then , when he could see no more , I would " carry on " again . So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , this heavy rain was not continuous , but the squalls which we went through at frequent intervals generally took ten minutes to pass . RACING THE STORM Still another difficulty presented itself . As long as we were flying south , the strong wind helped us ; but as we had to follow the coast-line in detail , and there were many bays and headlands , we frequently found ourselves fighting right into the teeth of the gale to get out of a bay or weather a headland . I was afraid to go inland , as the rain only allowed us limited visibility . Once we almost crashed on to a hill , which suddenly loomed up through the rain ahead . I just had time by a hair 's breadth to pull the machine around in a climbing turn and go farther out to sea . I have never experienced worse flying conditions , and had it been at all possible to land , I gladly would have done so . All the flat stretches along the coast were paddy-fields under water . We were wet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what an ignominious end it would be if we had engine trouble and were forced to land in a paddy-field of mud and water . I wondered at our marvelous engines ? through the snows of France , the blaze of the tropics , and through these terrible rains , they still roared merrily on . An hour before reaching Singora we passed through and outstripped the storm . As the clouds were still low , we kept our  | altitude down to 1,000 feet , passing here and there scattered villages , scaring the water buffaloes , which would career off , flashing across the paddy-fields as fast as their bulk would allow . At last we reached Singora. and a glance at the aerodrome showed that at least half of it was under water . There was , however , a narrow strip along the center which appeared more or less dry , but I would have to make a landing across wind . I came down low to examine this , trip , and to my utter dismay noticed that it was covered with small tree-stumps ! A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no other spot on which to land ; so there was nothing for it but to attempt to make a landing on this narrow strip of stump-studded ground . As we touched and ran along , I expected every moment to feel a jolt and the under-carriage wrenched off , or else the machine thrown on to her nose ; but by the merciful guidance of Providence we miraculously came to rest safely . The only damage sustained was to our tail-skid , which had caught in a stump and been wrenched off . I walked back along our tracks and found that in several instances our wheels had missed by a few inches stumps a foot to eighteen inches high . THE DEVIL IN THE MACHINE The whole native population assembled to see us . None had ever seen an aeroplane before . and at first they would not venture near . Three Englishmen live at Singora , and one of them had imposed upon the simple native minds that the devil was going to arrive in a flying chariot to take charge over all the convicts there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans climbed out of the machine , they quickly surged around us . I noticed that they were staring , arguing , and pointing at us in a peculiar way ; but it was not until I heard of our friend 's joke that I understood the full significance of their interest in us . Several of them walked in front of the machine , flapping their arms and performing birdlike evolutions . We concluded that they were solving the mystery of flight and demonstrating how the Vimy flapped its wings to rise from the ground . My brother , unobserved , climbed into the cockpit and , seizing the control column , vigorously moved it to and fro , which caused the ailerons* and elevators to flap about . There was a wild scamper in all directions . We learned afterwards that the natives imagined that we were flapping our wings preparatory to starting off ? A PETROL SHORTAGE My first inquiry was as to the quantity of petrol available . I discovered that the supposed goo gallons was only goo liters , depoted there for Poulet . This meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get sufficient petrol from Penang or Bangkok to take us on to Singapore . I accordingly sent off an urgent wire to the Asiatic Petroleum Company at Penang , asking them to send me 200 gallons of aviation petrol as speedily as possible . I also wired the resident councilor at Penang , asking him to assist , in the event of there being difficulty in getting this quantity of petrol shipped at such short notice . I next requested the Governor of Singora to have part of the aerodrome cleared of stumps to enable us to take off . Our machine was left standing on the strip of high ground and we pegged her down securely for the night . Our next contract was to mend the tailskid . An examination showed that the fitting which attaches it to the fuselage had broken off . This meant at least six hours ' work , provided we could find the  | necessary materials . One of our English friends took us to a local Chinaman , a jack of all trades and the master of a promising heap of scrap-iron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lathe was available to turn it down to shape and size , fitted our purpose . We then proceeded to a near-by rice mill which was just whistling off for the night . There we found a good lathe , but of primitive motive power . Four coolies turned a large pulley-wheel , and their power was transmitted by belt to the lathe . Bennett got to work at once by the light of a kerosene lamp . After an hour 's hard work , little impression was made on the steel , and our four-cooliepower engine " konked out . " Four more coolies were secured , but after half an hour they went on strike and demanded more money . I gave them the increase , but fifteen minutes later they went on strike again . This time we called the foreman from the rice mill . There was a different kind of strike , and so the work proceeded . VI . How WE MADE OuR HOMING FLIGHT By to p. m . Bennett had completed the job . and , considering the makeshift tools , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rain began to fall , so we returned to the bungalow which had been placed at = our disposal by H. R. H. Prince Yugula. just before midnight we were awaz = kened by the sound of a torrential downpour ? the storm which we had passed through ( luring the day had reached Singora . The wind increased to a gale , p = and , fearing that the machine might be in danger , we all turned out and kept watch . Fortunately . we had pegged her nose into the wind . but ( luring the heavysqualls the Vimy so strained at her lashings that several times I feared she would be swept away and crushed . We stood by all night . obtaining what little shelter we could from the wings , and at every squall rushed out and held on to the planes . Needless to say , we were drenched to the skin , and when the wind eased down . shortly after daybreak , TRALIA BY AEROPLANE , 321 we felt tired and miserable , with no dry clothes to put on . Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of the aerodrome excepting the ridge on which the machine was standing resembled a lake . Luckily , the ground was sandy , and after the rain ceased the water drained off rapidly . Squalls continued throughout the day . but Bennett and Shiers. after rigging a tarpaulin shelter , were able to work on their engines . After breakfast in the bungalow we returned to the machine and found that the government had sent down zoo convicts from the local jail to clear away the stumps ; and so we set them to work to clear a strip about 400 yards long and fifty yards wide across the aerodrome . The day 's rest from flying was a delightful relaxation ; in fact , an imperative necessity , for my brother 's and my ow'n eyes were almost too painful for vision , after the previous day 's battling with the storm . Late that afternoon our petrol arrived from Penang , but it was raining too heavily to risk putting it into the machine . We were greatly indebted to Captain Owen Hughes , an ex-Royal Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his prompt attention in arranging for its transport . A TRICKY TAKE-OFF After a much-needed night 's rest , we were down at the aerodrome at daylight , and after putting the zoo gallons of petrol into the tanks , started up the engines . Getting the machine into the air was a questionable problem , but , as our time for reaching Australia was fast closing in , we decided to make the attempt . Three large patches of water extended across the aerodrome at intervals of about fifty yards . This water was , on the average , six inches deep ; but , as the aerodrome was sandy , our wheels did not sink appreciably into it . A clear run of fifty yards allowed the machine to gather fair headway . Then she struck the water , which almost pulled us up ; a race across another fifty yards of hard ground , and by the time we had passed through the second patch of water the machine was  | moving very little faster than at the beginning . The third patch of ground was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were traveling at about thirty miles per hour . The sudden impact with the water almost threw the Vimy on to her nose , and water was sucked up and whirled in every direction by the propellers . Our flying speed had to be gained on the seventy yards of dry ground which now remained ; beyond that extended scrub and gorse bushes . The Vimy bounded forward as soon as she left the water , and just managed to get sufficient lift on her wings to clear a ditch and scrape over the scrub . I had been informed that the weather would be much better on the western coast of the peninsula , so we followed the railway line across to that side . As the clouds hung only a few hundred feet above the railroad , we were compelled to descend to a perilously low altitude , which was rendered the more hazardous by huge limestone outcrops , rising four to five hundred feet , scattered over the country . A FASCINATING LAND Along the western shores we found the weather much improved : the clouds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shadow effects across the paddy-fields and scattered villages . We still maintained a low altitude , which added greatly to the interest of the flight and also gave us a splendid opportunity of studying intimately this remarkable and productive country . Near Kaular Lumpar we entered the tin country and observed many tin dredges in full operation . Lower still we flew across the rubber plantations , cheered by the planters and waving back . Then , passing above Malacca , we reached Singapore in the afternoon , after one of the most interesting stages of the journey . I had been dreading the landing and take-off at Singapore , as the improvised aerodrome , the race-course , was altogether too small for our large machine . I glided the Vimy down at as low a speed as possible , and just before we touched the ground Bennett clambered out of the cockpit and slid along the top of the fuselage down to the tail-plane . His weight dropped the tail down quickly . with the result that the machine pulled up in about one hundred yards after touching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my birthday , and to reach Australia within the specified thirty-day time limit meant that we had to arrive in Darwin on the 12th , eight days from now , and four more landings to make after leaving Singapore . Thus it will be seen we still had four days in hand . I therefore decided to remain the whole of next day at Singapore and work on our machine . AN " EARLY " DANCE We now had , roughly , 2,500 miles complete , and in all that distance I knew of only five places at which a landing could be made ; the rest of the country was either mountain , jungle , or swamp : so it behooved us to look well to our machine , for a single engine trouble and a forced landing away from any of these aerodromes would have ended all . The heat at Singapore was intense and , coming from the cold of the English winter , we felt it severely . After a heavy day on the machine , we were asked that night to a dance at the Tanglin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My host , in a very persuasive manner . did his utmost to induce me to go . assuring me the dance would be over very early . However , when we arrived at our machine , at daylight next morning , and were getting ready to start off , my quondam host of the night before and some of his party arrived , all still wearing evening dress . They had just come from the early dance ! As I have mentioned previously , the ground was much too small for an aerodrome , and the heavy rain which had fallen overnight made it very heavy . My brother and I paced over and examined the ground and discussed the best way to take off , but we were both very dubious as to whether we could get the machine into the air or would pile her tip on the adjacent houses in the attempt . I taxied into the position , so as  | to give the maximum amount of run , and then opened the throttle full out . We gathered way slowly , and I watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still we were not off the ground . It was a tense and anxious moment . When fifty yards from the rails , I pulled my control-lever back ; the trusty Vimy rose to the occasion and iust cleared the rails . There were still houses and trees to be negotiated , and I set the Vimy climbing at an alarmingly steep angle . Another breathless moment passed , and the wheels of the under-carriage just brushed the tree-tops . It was a great triumph for the Vimy . She achieved the seemingly impossible , and to this day I regard our escape from disaster during this perilous take-off as providential and one of the finest maneuvers of the whole voyage . HEADING FOR JAVA After a wide sweep above Singapore , we headed for the open sea and Java .  | Passing down to the Sumatran coast , we ran into characteristic doldrum weather ? isolated patches of dark thunder-storm clouds , from which the rain teemed down in heavy , murky columns . Occasional forks of lightning seared the clouds , throwing up into relief their immense bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where almost stagnation expanded . Occasionally a light zephyr came out of the east , but almost in the course of a few minutes the puff had boxed the compass and died away . BUMPING OVER " THE LINE " The spectacle of these local storms was extremely uncanny , and by navigating accordingly it was easy to avoid them . On reaching the coast of Sumatra we encountered a light head wind and flying conditions became very bumpy . One immense vacuum into which we fell made us hold tight and wonder .  | " That 's the Equator , " ejaculated my brother , and , sure enough , by dead reckoning , we had bumped across the line into the Southern Hemisphere . Our entrance into the Southern Hemisphere was welcomed by improved weather , but the landscape below ? dense jungle inland , fringed along the seashore by belts of mangrove swamps and the blue tropical sea ? often kindled in my mind thoughts of utter helplessness in case of engine trouble . There developed in me a strange admiration ? almost reverence ? for the supermechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles without an overhaul , and at the opposite side of the globe was still singing a hymn of praise to the makers , as it had done when the bleak wintry snows had carpeted the aerodrome at Hounslow and northern France . How far away this all seemed ! These were times , indeed , for musing , as we sped along above this tranquil tropical landscape , home only a few days away ? an achievement ! Numerous small islets ? emeralds in a setting of turquoise ? passed below us . There were yearlings to land and explore their mangrove-fringed bays and foreshores , but the nearest landing was our destination , Batavia . Soon the large island of Muntok came below , and in the strait separating the mainland we passed a vessel . Subsequently we learned she was equipped with wireless and had transmitted news of our arrival on to Batavia . I had originally intended to hug the coast of Sumatra on to Java ; but as it was all dense mangrove swamp , with no sign of a possible landing-place . I reasoned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My brother computed the compass course , and so we headed direct for Batavia . THE LANDING AT KALEDJAT The hazy contours of the mountains marking the western end of Java soon began to show up to starboard , and ahead a scene of rare enchantment began to resolve itself upon the bosom of the tropical sea . The sea was a glorious mirror almost as rippleless as the canopy above , and scat- tered broadcast lay a thousand isles , each one beautiful , and all combined to make one of the most beautiful sights I have ever looked down upon . Many of the islands are heavily grown with palms extending to the very water 's edge ; others , sparsely cultivated , fringed with a narrow ribbon of beach ; but around each is a setting of an exquisite shade of green , marking a sand-girt shallow ; then deepblue and depth . Myriads of tiny white fisher-sails passed through the channels , gleaning their harvest from the sea . Reluctantly we turned from this glimpse of fairy-land , and , bearing for the Garden Island of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beautiful avenues . Following the railway line , we landed at the Dutch Flying School at Kaledjat . The Dutch had sent an escort of four machines to welcome us ; but , although they passed within about 50o feet of the Vimy , they missed us . The distance of 60o miles from Singapore we had covered in just nine hours . Hearty greeting was extended to us by His Excellency Count Van Limburg Stirum , the Governor-General of the Netherlands Indies , and a large number of leading officials . After a well-enjoyed meal , we set to work on the machine . The petrol available was very heavy , and it took us eight hours to filter 350 gallons through the chamois leather strainer into the tanks . As the next stage to Soerabaya was only a short lap , we did not leave Kaledjat before 7.30 . THE BOUNTEOUS GARDEN OF ' JAVA With beautiful weather favoring us , we sped rapidly over fertile tracts of this amazing island , charmed by the unsurpassable beauty that unfolded below . Java impressed me as one vast bounteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of volcanic mountains . Perhaps one of the most striking sights was the " paddy " country . From our height , the whole expanse of the land appeared to be inundated by irrigation water ? all contained in miniature , celllike squares , that gave the effect of a mighty grid , stretching away to the moun-  | tains on our right . Even there the irrigation ( lid not cease , but climbed up the mountain sides in a system of stairlike terraces . Here and there native villages nestled beneath the shelter of the palm groves or among the verdant green of sugar plantations . Always in the background , subdued by tropic haze . rose the chain of peaks , practically all quiescent , and far away to the left that faint blue line which marked the Pacific horizon . Nearing Soerabaya , flying became very bumpy , and it was no small relief when the town , like a magic carpet of multicolored fabric , spread beneath us . Heading the Vimy down , we made a low circle above the town , to the infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets , petrified , evidently , by the visitation . As the aerodrome was small . I decided to land on the north side , so that , if we overshot its length , I could , perhaps , swing round to the left . This maneuver , however , I discovered to be unnecessary . We made a good landing and were easing off to rest when the machine seemed to drag , and from past experience I knew at once the Vimy was becoming bogged . IN THE MUD Opening up the starboard engine , v , -e began to swing slowly , but the port wheels immediately sank into the mud and we tilted on to our fore-skid . At once I shut off both engines and the Vimy adually eased back to her normal position . The natives and people . who had been kept back by the Dutch soldiers . rushed the ground . and their weight on the sundried crust soon broke it up . and mud began to ooze through . In a very short while the Vimy subsided to her axles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition literally was a decidedly sticky one . It was midday , broiling hot , and the tenacity of the mud reminded me forcibly of that clinging tendency familiar to our black-soil plains . Moreover , only four days of our prescribed time remained in which we must make Port Darwin . @# The engineer of the Harbor Board arrived , and together we discussed the situation . He collected a horde of coolies and a large quantity of bamboo matting , and so we set to work to dig out the wheels . After some hard work we got the matting almost under the wheels , started up the engine , and , aided by the coolies and Dutch soldiers , the Vimy was hauled from the bog . I then stopped the engines , tied ropes to the under-carriage , and the machine was pulled on to a pathway of mats ( see page 316 ) . After a couple of hours the machine was safe out of the morass , and the ground on which we stood felt quite solid ; so I thought we had landed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to taxi to the opposite end under our own engine-power . I was soon disillusioned , for , after moving but ten yards , down went the wheels again . More digging , tugging , and pushing , and we . apprehensive all the while as to whether the coolies would drag off the under-carriage , finally had to lay down a pathway of bamboo mats and have the machine hauled by 200 coolie-power . I should say here that our hearty thanks are due to the harbor engineer and the officials ? indeed , to all who lent a hand ? for without them it would have been impossible for us to have completed the flight on the scheduled time . MAKING A RUNWAY OF NATIVE ROOFS My brother and I had decided that it would be impossible to get the Vimy into the air in the usual way , so we consulted with our invaluable friend , the engineer , and he agreed to collect bamboo matting from far and wide . so that we might construct a mat-paved roadway . I observed that this matting formed the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire villages in the immediate vicinity were stripped bare to provide us with the necessary materials . The British consul invited us to a " quiet " dinner that evening , but when we arrived at the cafe even- British resident in Soerabaya had gathered there to welcome us.  | Next morning saw us at the aerodrome by daylight , and a gladsome sight met our eyes . Natives were streaming in from every direction bearing sheets of bamboo matting ? they were literally carrying their houses on their backs ? and already a great pile of it lay by the Vimy ( see pages 314-317 ) . At first a pathway of mats was merely laid down , but in our keen anxiety to get off we had overlooked the " slip-stream " from the propellers . The engines were opened up and we were just gathering speed nicely when some of the sheets were whisked up and blown into the tailplane . The fabric was torn , a tire punctured , and the Vimy ran off and bogged badly . Once more we had to extricate the wheels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interlaced the mats . More matting arrived on a motor-lory. so we lengthened the road , said a second  | good-bye , and , just twenty-four hours after our arrival at Soerabaya , made a sensational take-off , with the mats flying in all directions . We circled low over the town and anchorage , so as to give the engines time to settle down to normal . running , and then we headed on a direct compass course for Bima . From the point of view of a prospective forced landing , the 400-mile flight to Bima was impossible . Not a single flat occurred on which we might have landed . Scenically , this lap was glorious . We skirted the coast of Bali and Lombok , keeping only 2,000 feet above the sea . The Bima aerodrome we found in excellent condition , clearly marked with a white ring and encircled by a waterretaining wall . The natives scampered in all directions and would not venture near until they saw us walking about the machine . The local sultan and the Dutch officer met us and proffered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine . Here we aroused intense interest ; eyes taking little furtive glimpses at us peered through every crack and During that night some gentleman tried to force my window . I waited quietly until he had raised the sash halfway ; then a shot from my Very light pistol put him to a screaming and , I have no doubt , a terror-stricken flight . The natives had recovered from their shyness by next morning , and on our arrival were swarming around the machine with presents of coconuts sufficient to start a plantation ; evidently they thought the Vimy a very thirsty sort of bird . We took a cargo of nuts on board , as the water was unsuited for drinking , and , setting off in dazzling sunshine , once more pursued our course above scenes of tropical enchantment and alluring charm . AT TIMOR After following the north coast of Flores to Reo , we crossed over to the south side of the island and ran into isolated rainstorms . We observed a volcano in active eruption on the eastern horizon , but , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not afford to make a deviation . We flew on as far as Pandar , and then swung off direct for Timor .  | We had by this time acquired such confidence in our engines that it mattered little what lay below us ? sea or land . The thick volcanic smoke soon obscured the land and all distant vision , but we eventually picked up the Timor coast a few hundred yards from our calculated position . Ten miles inland we came down on the aerodrome at Atamboea. our last landing ground before Port Darwin . The Dutch officials , who welcomed us , had thoughtfully arranged our petrol and oil supply close at hand , saving us a good deal of valuable time , which we were able to devote to a thorough overhaul . THE NIGHT BEFORE THE FINAL " TAKE OFF " Tomorrow would be the great day whereupon reposed the destiny of our hopes , labors , and ideals . This was one of the aerodromes specially made by the Governor-General of the Netherlands Indies for the Australian flight , and had been completed only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers kept watch over the machine while we proceeded with their officers to camp , some six miles away . It is hardly necessary to say that none of us overslept . We were too excited at the prospect of the morrow . We felt sure that if it dawned fine and hot . our homing was assured : but as we stepped out , before sunrise , into the still , sluggish air , we realized that our hopes of an early start were small . A heavy haze lay over the sea and the coast , obscuring everything ; so we decided to await its clearing . We were at the aerodrome before sunup to discover that a great swarm of natives were even earlier risers than ourselves . Most had come afoot , but many had ridden their ponies , and they clustered on and around the fence , behind and beside the Vimy , like swarming bees . We had hauled the machine well back and raised the tail over the fence in order to take advantage of every foot of the short run . ONE Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those incidents that usually make material for comic papers . The pro- pellers were just " kicking " over , like two great fans , and those natives sitting on the fence in the line of the slip-stream were enjoying the cool breeze and looking pleased with themselves . When I opened up the engines and both propellers swung into action , the sudden blast of air sent these particular spectators toppling back into the crowd , where ponies and natives made a glorious mixup , at which we all laughed heartily . Soon after 8 the fog began to thin , and by 8.35 , to be exact . I opened up the engines and just managed to scrape out of the ' drome . Scrape is exactly the word , for the branch-tops of the gumtree rasped along the bottom of the machine as we rose . It was indeed one of the closest shaves of the trip . In front of us rose a chain of high hills , and , as the atmosphere was hot and we climbed very slowly , we made a detour to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast and pulled ourselves together for the final lap ? the jump across the sheet of blue Indian Ocean that lay between us and Port Darwin . Keith took all possible bearing 's , noted wind direction , and made numerous calculations of ground speeds . Then we set compass course for Darwin , and with a " Here goes ! " we were out over the sea . All our hearts were beating a little quicker even our tine old engines seemed to throb a trifle faster . SIGHT LNG Tint " SVDNI:Y- " Our watches registered 11.48 when Keith nodded ahead , and , dead on the line of our flight , we made out a faint smoke haze that soon resolved itself into the smoke-plume of a fighting-ship . It was the Sydney , and we knew now that , whatever might befall , we had a friend at hand . We swooped low , and exactly at twelve minutes past noon passed over the vessel . seeing plainly the upturned faces of the sailors and their waving hands . It was a cheer of welcome quite different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps it is not to be wondered at that the result of our snapshot was blurred through the shaking of the camera ( see page 324 ) .  | We took the opportunity of snatching a speed test , and found that we were averaging seventy-five miles an hour . THE FIRST GLIMPSE OE HOME An hour later both of us saw ahead and to port what appeared to be haze . but which we hoped was land , though neither dared express his hopes . They were justified , however , ten minutes later , and hailing Bennett and Shiers , we pointed joyfully to Bathurst Island lighthouse . It was just 2.6 p. m. when . as our diary prosaically notes , we " observed Australia . " At three o'clock we not only observed it , but rested firmly upon it , for . having circled over Darwin and come low enough to observe the crowds and the landing-place , we settled on Terra Australis on December loth , 27 ( lays 20 hours after taking off from Hounslow . Two zealous customs and health officials were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just ordinary citizens , and the odds of i , 000 to I were rather long for those departmental men , and our welcome was not delayed . The hardships and perils of the past month were forgotten in the excitement of the present . We shook hands with one another , our hearts swelling with those emotions invoked by achievement and the glamour of the moment . It was . and will be , perhaps , the supreme hour of our lives . Almost reverently we looked over the Vimy , and unspoken admiration crept over us as we paid a silent tribute to those in far-off England for their sterling and honest craftsmanship . The successful issue of the venture , in a great degree . was due to them , and surely they merited and deserved a large proportion of the praise . Through every possible climatic rigor the Vimy had passed , and practically without any attention . Not once , from the time we took our departure from Hounslow , had she ever been under shelter . And now , as I looked over her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zenith of man 's inventive and constructional genius . I could find neither fault nor flaw in the construction , and . given a few days overhaul on the engines , the Vimv would have been quite capable of turning round and flying back to England . OUR WELCOME HOME These reflections were of brief duration , for the crowd , having satisfied its curiosity over the machine , directed it to  | us The Administrator of the Northern Territory and the Mayor of Darwin were given barely time to make an official welcome when the assemblage , brimming with enthusiasm , lifted us shoulder high and conveyed us to the jail ! This sinister objective , for the moment , gave us qualms , for we fully expected a charge of exceeding the speed limit to be preferred against us . That drastic apprehension resolved itself into being dumped on a tree-stump , historic or otherwise , in the garden . while raucous howls of " Speech ! Speech ! " came from the hospitable multitude . After the exchange of much hot air on both sides , we returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her down for the night . OVERWHELMED WITH TELEGRAMS During our stay at Darwin we were the guests of Mr. Staniford Smith , at Government House . And now we were to be bewildered by an amazing array of cables and telegrams . They arrived in great fifteen-minute shoals from every corner of the globe . What had gone wrong ? Surely every one had gone mad ? or had we ? Why all this fuss and excitement ? In our race across the globe eye had not read a newspaper , and , beyond the local natural attention evinced at our numerous landinggrounds , we knew nothing of the interest the rest of the world was taking in the flight . Great indeed was our astonishment when , on turning up back files of newspapers , we read of our exploits , recorded with a degree of detail that must have taxed the imaginative resources of editorial staffs to gray hairs . The rush , strain , and anxiety were over ; henceforward the conclusion of our flight across Australia could be undertaken leisurely ; and , what was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best possible flying conditions . Much of the flight over featureless wastes would have been drear and monotonous , but it was Australia and that was compensation enough . Moreover , we had the occasional diversion of passing over the small out-back towns , where many of the inhabitants rushed into the streets and stood looking up , waving and cheering . The sublimest spectacle of the entire flight from Hounslow to our journey 's end was to burst upon us when we arrived over Sydney and its wonderful harbor . Like a mighty fern-leaf , ramifying and studded with islets , this glorious waterway unfolded below . The city and its environs , massed along the waterfront and extending into the hinterlands , flanked by the Blue Mountains , compose a spectacle of exquisite charm and beauty. * We headed up the coast and , turning through the entrance , entered the port . Planing down to boo feet , we flew above a myriad ferry-boats and vessels , front the whistles of which little white jets of steam spurted up , screaming a welcome ; then across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the streets below , where little specks paused to look tip and join in the greeting . It was a great day ? a time that comes once in a lifetime . THE PRIZE IS DIVIDED EQUALLY Not the least pleasant incident upon our arrival finally in Melbourne was the paying over of the f10,000 prize by the Prime Minister , the Right Hon. W. M. Hughes , on behalf of the Commonwealth Government . As all participated equally in the perils and labors of the enterprise , the prize was divided into four equal shares . In Melbourne I formally handed the Vimy over to the Commonwealth Government on behalf of Messrs . Vickers Ltd. , who generously presented the machine to the Commonwealth as an historic relic of the first aerial flight from London to Australia . At the request of the authorities , I flew the machine on to Adelaide , my native city , and thus realized to the full my ambition and dream of flying from London to my own home . It would be hard indeed to comprehend the feelings that surged through me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native city ? the recognition of familiar faces ; the greeting of well-known voices ; the See " Lonely Australia , the Unique Continent , " by Herbert E. Gregory , in the NATIONAL GeocRAPaiC 1IACAZNq for December , Ig16.  | hand-clasp of innumerable friends ; but , greatest of all , the reunion with my parents after five long years . Our heartfelt thanks are due to the officers and mechanics of the Royal Air Force : to the Dutch authorities for constructing aerodromes and other assistance , and for the cooperation of numerous friends , whose willing and generous help laid the paving-stones over which Fortune piloted me . My brother Keith shares equally any worthiness that the effort might merit , as also do my two master mechanics , Sergeants Bennett and Shiers , whose loyalty and devotion to duty have done much to bind closer the outposts of the Empire through the trails of the skies .
