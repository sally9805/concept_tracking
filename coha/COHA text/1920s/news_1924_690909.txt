txt For Limiting the Pump-Gun . I noted with interest your editorial In this morning 's TIMES in relation to the elimination of the " pump-gun " from our hunting fields . This is indeed a worthy move both from the standpoint of conservation of our wild life and froin that of the true sportsman . I was sorry to note , however , that your unfamiliarity with this type of weapon forced you to give the impression that to eliminate this aid to the wholesale slaughter of game would necessitate the choice between depriving many hunters who possess this type of weapon of their sport or else purchasing new guns , or the more impracticable method of educating them all to the principles of true sportsmanship . The method used in the State of New Jersey-ls more simple than either of the above , I. this type of weapon is prohibited unless so arranged that not more than two shells can be inserted in the gun at one time . As practically allmakes of repeating shotguns can be fixed so as to comply with this ruling by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length in the magazine , or by some similar simple contrivance , the passage of such a worthy law would entail practically no hardship to any but the " game hogs .
