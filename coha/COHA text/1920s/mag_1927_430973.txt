 | DEAR AGNES : Wo n't you please stop worrying about me ? In the first place , you ought to know by now that I always land on my feet sooner or later , and if there is sometimes a whirl through space before the landing , it is a whirl so full of thrills and joie de vivre that it never occurs to me there is any danger to it . In the second place , I wish I could convince you that the gravity of conditions abroad is always exaggerated at home , either consciously or unconsciously . In spite of assurances that we were headed for battle , murder , and sudden death , the boys and I left London for Vienna during the recent " revolution " on schedule time , determined to go as far as the train would , and then , if stopped , to wait until it could continue or another one came along . We made the trip from London to Folkestone without so much as a jar , devouring an excellent lunch meanwhile ; crossed from Folkestone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channel ; and were whisked into our conzpurtemen.ts on the Suisse-Alberg Express , which was waiting at the wharf , without confusion , delay , or inconvenience . We woke the next morning beside the shining shores of the Lake of Zurich ; and crossing the Austrian frontier at Buchs , two hours later , passed the most delightful day , without any exception , that I have ever spent in a train . The road is electrified almost as far as Salzburg , with plans for further electrification in the immediate future ? in this respect Austria leads the world in travel comfort ? and so , the nuisance and menace of cinders being entirely eliminated , we were able to leave the windows wide open to admit the sparkling sunshine and stimulating air . Meanwhile the train wound its way through the Tyrolean Alps , which are unsurpassed and unsurpassable in the splendor of their scenery : snowcapped mountains wreathed in clouds ; precipices of solid rock cutting their way from sky to earth ; gentle green slopes , soft as velvet ; deep evergreen forests , erect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to dim mysterious  | distances ; wide golden plains of wheat , poppy-peppered ; gardens and fields , beautifully cultivated and fertile ; towered castles clinging to bleak bedrock or crowning the crests of hills ; villages of clustering , redroofed houses , the names of their owners written bravely between their gables , the slender spire of the high and narrow village church , heaven-pointed , in their midst . For twelve hours without a break , this ever-changing , everlovely panorama unrolled before our eyes ; then the setting sun turned snow and clouds to rosy brilliance and the crosses on the steeples to living gold ; and , as we left the mountains and came upon the plains , a jagged , ruddy moon tipped jovially against the black horizon . We reached Vienna , as we had left London , on schedule time ; betook ourselves to a hotel quite as good as the one we had somewhat reluctantly left , fearing that such comforts as it provided were not likely to be our lot again this summer ; and went soundly and peacefully to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely as when I came here as a young girl ? more freely , in fact , for then a good many restrictions were placed upon a jeune fills comme it fact in a continental city , and during the recent disturbances not a single foreigner was molested or even inconvenienced . And , wandering , I find it as charming as ever : a city of such elegance ? if one may use such a word of a city ? of such distinction , that it is unsurpassed anywhere in the world ; a city of parks and palaces , of insidiously attractive shops , and obviously attractive , open-air restaurants , set simply on the broad sidewalks , or ? with more elaboration ? in the midst of gardens . A city of such music as one never hears anywhere else so brilliant , so beguiling , and yet so hauntingly wistful . A city that offers open-handed so many delights that we can not accept them all , and it is difficult to choose between them . We may go to the Burggarten , and listen to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivy-covered wall , and the old Imperial Palace looming behind them . We may wander through the Suburban Palace of Schonbrunn , peopled with the spirits of the Hapsburgs , though they have left it in the flesh . We may linger in the perpetual and peaceful twilight of St. Stefan 's Cathedral or in the gold and rainbow glory of Santa Maria von Siege . We may go to tea at Kobenzl , that lovely suburban spot with the most enchanting of views , only twenty minutes by motor from the heart of the city which it surmounts , though flanked with virgin forest . We may eat our late supper in the Rathauskellar , the  | basement of the town hall ? the musicians , who clap their hands with a strange thudding beat between the verses of their songs , are placed directly in front of a great , carved , illuminated cask . The flower-girl who offers you roses is plump and a little frowsy , and her dress is shabby , but her ruddy face shines with good nature , and her yellow hair is crisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables about the room , and the knives and forks are certainly not silver , and there are not plates enough to go around ; but the creamed venison and the omelette aux confitures are delicious . There are only three harassed waiters for the entire company , but how skilful and interested these waiters are , how content and congenial the company , taking its ease with no sense of either haste or excitement , at the end of a day 's work ! More fashionably inclined , for a change , we may dine at the Schloss Cafe , with scarlet shades on our table candles , and the utmost luxury of appointment and service . And being Americans , and fortunate ones at that , we go to our Legation , where the Minister , Mr. Washburn , and his lovely and charming wife dispense such delightful and boundless hospitality . They live in the oldest palace in Vienna ? a palace of which the barred and bolted door opens from a narrow slit of a side street into a paved courtyard of austere gray beauty ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone stairs , we pass through a finely proportioned hall into rooms that are impregnated with history and romance . King John Sobieski of Poland lived there during the Turkish invasion , and the ballroom was the scene of his triumphal dinner after he had conquered the enemy . Later the palace was occupied by the Esterhazy family , and in the red drawing-room Schubert first rendered his immortal serenade to the beautiful countess . There are vaulted underground chambers , indicating that an early Christian church was beneath the palace , and there was also an underground passage to St. Stefan 's Cathedral . There is even a traditional ghost , protecting a buried treasure , to make the glamour complete ! Many great artists have spoken of the friendly atmosphere which the old walls have accumulated , and which inspires them to do their best , and in this colorful setting the boys and I take our first luncheon in Vienna ; and I celebrate my birthday , with a party and a cake " n'everything , " so-that I am not lonely ? that is , not too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attend the dansant given in honor of the touring Smith College girls ? of which institution Mrs. Washburn is a graduate , not to mention a grand and glorious official dinner to which the members of the diplomatic corps are bidden in full force , resulting in a gathering so distinguished , and withal so delightful and merry , that we reluctantly tear ourselves away from it at two o'clock in the morning . The Austrian Tyrol But the palace is not the only place in which we see the Washburns . One day we go , at their invitation , to Semmering , the beautiful mountain resort in the Austrian Tyrol , which lies about two hours from Vienna by motor , through scenery past my powers of description , with a marvellous turreted castle on a rocky cliff thrown in for good measure . Venturing far beyond that , up a valley through which runs a crystal stream in whose emerald depths trout are darting to and fro , we glimpse the famous hunting lodge of the former Kaiser near the village of Miirzteg ; and proceed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " Dead Wife , " so-called because a young and lovely bride lost her life there long ago , and which , marked with a simple cross , still flows in white and deathless purity down the mountain side . Then , retracing our footsteps , we find the simple gasthaus ( inn ) of Franz Frost  | " under the lindens , " as the sign above the low lintel of the door reminds us ; and under these lindens that shade the humble hostel we lunch largely and wondrously on the trout which Mr. Washburn and Mr. Groves , the Commercial Attache have caught that very morning ; on potatoes brought from the nearest village , for . there are none nearer ; on lettuce plucked by our hostess in the garden while we wait , and piquantly dressed ; on apfel strudel , the glorified apple-pie of Austria ; on " white coffee , " which means perfect black coffee sweetened to a turn and topped with whipped cream . And , when we can eat no more , we relax in the afternoon sun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to lengthen , and we must turn our faces cityward again . Do you wonder that I say Vienna is a city of so many attractions we can not accept them all and it is difficult to choose between them ? And yet it is a sad city , too , a city haunted with tragedy . It was once the sparkling capital of a great empire " the most brilliant capital in Europe . " It is now the one large city of a poverty-stricken republic , an economic deadweight on the rest of the country ? for the entire population of present-day Austria is only 6,000,000 , and that of Vienna is 2,000,000 . And granting that the dogged determination without which the new order could not possibly have survived , reveals something far finer than anything that existed in the aristocratic but decadent and moribund old order , the ashes of empire , still scattered about , are redolent of pomp and pagentry which are dead forever , and which have left many mourners . This condition in itself emanates grief , but there is another sadder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly starved to death . This is not a figure of speech . It is a horrible fact . The most brilliant capital in Europe escaped annihilation from hunger by so narrow margin that it has not yet fully recovered from this experience , and many survivors of the famine are indelibly marked by what they went through . Poverty Under the Pomp You sometimes succeed in forgetting this ? heaven knows you try hard enough , as a matter of national pride ; for it is no credit to us that we did not help her more ! ? and , as I have said , there are countless attractions and distractions to help you do it . Then suddenly you are reminded of it so forcibly that it is almost impossible for you to keep your self-control : by the servant whose swift and skilful attention to your needs you seek to recompense , and whos startled gratitude reveals his present need an past suffering . By the musician who lays down his violin , and whose face , so animated an instant before , is in repose full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who greets you with all the inimitable charm of the grande noblesse , but whose bands of crepe are wrapped around a broken heart . Even in those contented groups which foregather in the Rathauskellar and the Burggarten you catch an undercurrent of feeling so strong that sometimes you can hardly believe that there has been no audible expression to it . " Yesterday we had no money ; tomorrow we may have none ; therefore let us spend what we have today on music that we may be cornforted . " ? " Yesterday some of us were hungry ; tomorrow some of us will be hungry again ; let us therefore eat , drink , and be merry . " It is the sort of resignation , long developed , which has been known through countless ages , and in many countries , to produce revolutions . Indeed , the taxi-driver who took us home from the Rathauskellar told us that the last time he had driven away from that vicinity he had had three dead men in his car . And this brings me to the saddest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riots , and which , as described in the American press , caused you such concern in connection with my visit to Austria . The political situation of that nation is peculiar : the country  | districts ? the provinces , or Lander , as they are called ? are almost wholly conservative , in both sentiment and government , and the balance of national power is held by the conservatives ( " nationalists " or " Christian socialists " ) headed by the Chancellor , Monsignor Seipel , of whom more hereafter , for he is a personage so remarkable that I planned to go to Vienna on purpose to see him long before I knew that a crisis was to bring him into still greater prominence . The city of Vienna , on the contrary , is " social democratic , " or radical , in both sentiment and government , and its Mayor , or Burgomeister , Seitz , is a strong socialist . It is only fair to say , in passing , that this city government has done much for the welfare of the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gymnasia , playgrounds and schools . A short time ago , two nationalists who had been charged with manslaughter in connection with the death of two socialists which occurred in a shooting affray at Shattendorf , near the Hungarian border line , were acquitted , after it was alleged that they had pleaded guilty to this offense . When the news of this acquittal was made public , a socialist parade was arranged as a demonstration of protest . It seems clear that nothing more than this was intended , either by the socialist leaders or by the great majority of their followers , though they should not have been wholly unprepared for what followed , since such demonstrations have been known to get out of hand , both in Austria and elsewhere , before they are over . That , as you will recall , is what happened in Canton during the parade " protesting " against the Shanghai police ; and it is what happened this time in Vienna . The Parade of Protest Work ceased spontaneously in the morning set for the parade , and the first procession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine o'clock . Endeavoring to enter this and the University , it was held in check by the police , who did not have to fire . But by this time mob spirit had asserted itself ; bolshevistic propaganda began to harvest its poisonous fruit . The police station near the Parliament building was fired , and , a few minutes later , the rioters entered the Palace of Justice by means of ladders and set it afire with gasoline , their indignation ? which up to that time had found no adequate outlet ? against the criminal court which had given the verdict of acquittal , being given as the cause of the destruction . The Burgomeister mounted a fire engine and endeavored to remonstrate with the rioters , but his pleading was of no avail . Invaluable records and documents of all sorts , which can never be replaced , were burned both inside the Palace and by bonfire in the open court before it , and the fire brigade was prevented from approaching . By this time the police and the mob were in open conflict , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed , at least five times that number wounded , and many more arrested . That a general strike of public utilities should follow this day of bloodshed , fury , and unleashed class hatred was inevitable . By night , trains and trams had ceased running , mails and wires were completely tied up , and intermittent disturbances of a violent character continued . But the turbulent socialists had reckoned without their host : the provinces refused to respond ; and crippled without their cooperation , which meant that in eight days Vienna would have been without food , the strike was necessarily of short duration . The threats made to the Chancellor that it would not be called off unless he would resign , or at least compromise , were powerless to produce results ; he refused to be either intimidated or moved . The funerals of the victims of the riot took place without disturbance or demonstration of any kind from either party , normal conditions of transportation and communication were reestablished ,  | and the smoke of battle cleared away to reveal Seipel more firmly entrenched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Austrian people ? not to mention their neighbors in Czecho-Slovakia and Hungary ? determined to enforce Mr. Coolidge 's doctrine that " No one has a right to strike against the public safety , anyhow , anywhere , any time . " I reached Vienna in the midst of these events . Some of them I saw myself ; others I did not ; so I have reconstructed them for you from the best evidence I could obtain . Remembering how much you enjoyed the account which Mr. Sokolsky wrote , as an eye-witness of similar disturbances in Shanghai ? an account which he was good enough to allow me to interpolate in my own letter from there , greatly clarifying the recital of my own experiences ? I felt you would also welcome such a story from Vienna . So I consider myself fortunate in being able to repeat to you the account which Henry 's friend and classmate , " Bill " Nichols , has given me of " Bloody Friday , " as it is now generally known . " Bill " has just resigned from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of twenty-two ; his literary attainments ? among other attainments ? are great , and have already found numerous channels of expression ; and he spent the last days of a month 's visit in and near Vienna with us , adding greatly to our personal enjoyment , and to our general understanding of the city . " You know the steel shutters thay have on all the shop windows here ? " he said , settling himself comfortably in our salon upon his arrival . " Well , they pulled down the shutters and had a revolution . And then they pulled them up again . " " Yes , but seriously , Bill ? ? " I said , laughing and handing him his tea . An Eye-Witness Account " Well , then , seriously , my dear lady , it was like this : I started from the hilltop of Kobenzl , six miles out of the city , that morning to do a few errands , and on reaching Grunzing , the nearest tram station , found that there were no trams running . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word I could get from his volley of German was streichl I was left guessing whether a streich meant a sort of halfholiday , or a strike in the American sense of the word , but one thing it certainly did mean , and that was that there were no trams . So I decided to set out myself on foot and find out what else it meant . " For the first mile or two , the way led through a long stretch of dusty suburbs . Here everything was proceeding as usual . But nearer the center of the city , signs of the extraordinary began to appear . More and more the shops had their steel window screens pulled down . As I went on , I saw a body of road workers , with tools laid aside , engaged in violent discussion ; then a procession of workmen , all clad alike , in blue dungarees and jumpers , with close-cropped heads stooped forward , as they plodded slowly on in a heavy , ominous rhythm . Further on , a hospital , with a crowd gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a figure in blue , entering it . Next , from a side-street , a file of police , with sabres at their sides , marching slowly and ominously as the other procession had done ? all this made doubly strange by the blankness of the shuttered streets , and the strange quiet resulting from the absence of the usual clang of street cars . " I trusted that the police would take me into the center of things , so I fell in behind them . As we drew nearer the city , the streets became more noisy . Ambulances went whirling back and forth , fire engines passed us in a flash of red , taxis sped by with the piercing shrieks of the continental motor horns . " At last we struck the Ringstrasse , the great , octagonal boulevard built around the inner city ; and as we rounded the Votiv  | Kirche ? the votive church , built by the Emperor Franz Josef as a thank-offering for his escape from assassination ? I caught my first glimpse of the Rathaus , where a mob of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Palace of Justice , from which flame and thick smoke were pouring out . " From a distance it looked just like any other big fire ; but as I came nearer I discovered that the crowd was not an ordinary crowd . It was the Lower Depths : all the people you never see , and therefore are apt to forget ? the people who live in slum suburbs , and work invisibly ? by night , or in underground boiler rooms or high-walled factories , It was the submerged populace suddenly boiled over and spewed forth on Vienna 's most fashionable ' boulevard . They were all workmen , many of them in overalls and jumper , but some of them naked to the waist . A few were armed with long wooden clubs wrenched from the benches in the park and the Ringstrasse . They were milling about , shouting and gesturing , and now and again making a united sound describable only as Phewee ' with a terrible half-groaning , half-spitting quality , supposed to indicate the workmen 's hatred and contempt for the police . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed , halted , turned in another direction ; then , suddenly , as sounds of shouting came from the other end of the street , burst into full stampede , filling the pavements with the noise of thousands of clattering feet . Once they slowed down . Then , their curiosity getting the better of their fear , they turned , and very slowly at first , came walking back . There was a fresh alarm from the head of the line . The crowd halted , turned , and broke into a run . I dodged behind the Goethe monument , on which the rioters burst in a wave , rushing by from either side . " First came the casual observers , well-dressed men and pretty ladies . Then old workmen and their wives , who had come passively to view the spectacle as if it were a country fair . Behind them a body of workers in their greasy blue dungarees . Twice I saw men carried past by their fellows , with great sabre-gashes in their scalps , and the blood streaming down their necks ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it : a squadron of green-coated police , with sabres waving , who had charged the rioters in order to make way for the fire engines . Half-way down the street the police halted and withdrew ; and again the mad flight of people stopped , and they began to drift back , just as dust settles after it has been stirred up by a broom . The Riot Begins " Gradually the front ranks became more aggressive . Paving stones began to fly . Several mounted police were pulled from their horses and man-handled by the crowd . And the police at last gave up their sabres and took to their rifles . There was a sudden crackle of shooting behind the Parliament House , and again the rioters swept backward . They started down the Ringstrasse , and as that clogged , they flattened out against the high fence of the palace gardens ? great iron palings , a good fifteen or twenty feet high . There came another and louder spatter of rifle fire ; and the people crouched , climbing madly up the iron palings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring out of a log . " But I did n't stop long to watch them , for by this time I was in full flight , too . I found my refuge behind a wing of the great Burgtheater . From there I could peer out and get glimpses of the fire , and watch the people streaming past . And whenever the shooting broke out , as it did every few minutes , I could flatten down in an angle of the wall in comparative safety . I found two other persons in my sanctuary , one a workman 's wife and the other a shabby and unshaven but rather striking young man of twenty-seven or so . We stayed there for nearly an hour , @#  | since it seemed far safer than venturing out in the open . The crowds poured past us , only to be turned back by the police , who were holding the streets leading to the inner city . The noise of the shooting came nearer and nearer , and the people went rushing by in little clusters . One group passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead ; another was carrying a girl of fifteen who had been shot in the arm , which hung down limp , with the blood dripping from her fingers in a little trail . In the next group was a little old man , all hunched up and pushing his ice-cream cart for dear life . For all he was in full flight , he was still ringing his little bell with one hand , and stopping during lulls to vend ice-cream and soda-water ! " Finally came the last defiant group of workmen , their faces made wild and animallike by the passions suddenly let loose within them . Behind them were the police , all with their rifles over their shoulders , except those in the front rank , who had them leveled , covering the crowd in front . The defiant group of young workmen hung on at the corner till the very last moment , and then , as the police advanced within easy shooting distance , gave one more of their spitting , scornful shouts and scattered in every direction . " I made my exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police . Accompanied by the young man who had shared my shelter , I fell in beside them and marched to the entrance of the inner city , where my passport admitted us both . We went through several shuttered streets , where people were pattering anxiously by , and at last came to a restaurant , locked , but with some waiters peering through a glass door . My friend became voluble in German , I waved my passport , and at last we were admitted to a little cellar cafe , where two men were eating and a genteel old Viennese lady in black silk was rustling on the edge of her chair , ejaculating from time to time in my honor the only English words she knew , which , inappropriately enough under the circumstances , happened to be , Vienna is a beautiful city . ' As we ate , the guests , the manager , all the waiters , and even the chef gathered around our table , while my friend narrated first all the wild-fire rumors we had picked up on our flight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a country district to Vienna in order to learn a new trade , which I discovered to be the gentle art of swallowing swords , extinguishing cigarettes on his tongue , eating broken glass , and the like . He became so enthusiastic in describing his art that he began to demonstrate , and I confess that for all the flash of sabres , crackling guns , and dripping blood that I had seen during the day , my first real taste of horror came when I saw him put a burning cigarette in his mouth and then run a needle clear through the palm of his hand ! After the Battle " Finally the proprietor informed us that he had been ordered to close his shop , so we went out into the streets again , and strolled about the inner city until my sword-swallowing friend decided that it was safe to make a break for the suburbs . The trip back to the hilltop was a long and difficult one . Two taxicabs were taken away from us , Fur sanitat . ' But at last we found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crooked back streets , to avoid the crowds , and brought us back in safety . That night , looking down on the lights of the city , glimmering as they had always done , and with the placid width of the Danube showing blue in the moonlight , the events of the day faded away into dream-like unreality . But there remained indelibly the impression of the day , which can not and must not be forgotten . It was an impression of mob-passion suddenly rising , for reasons which it scarcely understood , like some prehistoric monster out of the slime , to trample down everything that came within its path . The times in Austria have been thrown badly out of joint . The pre-war industrial organization is out of proportion to  | the present purchasing power of the country ; and with no seaports , and a surrounding hedge of tariffs , the old export trade has gone . At the same time the natural resources of the old empire have been divided up among the neighboring states . From all this comes poverty , from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readjustment can be made to the new bare facts with which Austria is being faced , the monster may rear itself once more , and walk again . " So much for Bill 's story ; and now to continue my own : Ten days after " Bloody Friday , " Parliament was convened , and thanks to the kindness of Monsignor Seipel and of Mr. Washburn , I attended the opening session . The Parliament Building itself has a most impressive exterior , with spreading wings and lofty columns , and the semi-circular Chamber , decorated in shades of dull gold and soft brown , the rostrum flanked by statues of the great Greek lawgivers ? Lycurgus , Solon , Sophocles , Pericles and others ? has dignity and stability as well as beauty . The nationalists are placed on the left , the socialists on the right as they face the platform ; there are a number of women among the latter , six of whom , simply dressed in black , sat together in a little cluster ; and gradually the chief figures in the drama of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in simple black clerical garments , calm , erect , and ruddy ; Burgomeister Seitz , with Bauer , the secretary and leader of the Socialists , beside him , dark , intense , stooping . The Governor of Lower Austria is there , a quiet and comfortablelooking man , the Minister of Agriculture with a splendid red beard and fine head ; other cabinet officers . The President of the body , Michaelis , enters silently behind parted curtains , rings a great bell with violence , then raises his hand and motions to galleries and floor . Every one rises , and there is a hush , which I assume to presage a prayer , for the air is sentient with solemnity . But it is , instead , a eulogy . Michaelis is calling on all present to mourn with him for the dead . Then , while the audience still stands with bowed head , he reviews , briefly and with the greatest temperance , the events that have taken place , and exhorts the deputies to justice , to moderation , and to patience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is adjourned before any untoward event can break the spell of sorrow that he has woven with such consummate skill . Meeting the President of Austria Of the prominent persons in Austria today , there are two with whom I especially wish that you might become acquainted ; one of these is the President of the Republic , Herr Michael Hainisch , the son of the great leader of women in Austria and Southern Germany , Marianne Hainisch , who is still , at eighty-two , the outstanding feminine figure in her country . Michael Hainisch , after a short career in the Austrian public service , devoted himself to the study of social and agricultural subjects , and to the management of his model farm . He is the Founder of the Austrian Fabian Society , and of many public libraries , having been particularly active in the cause of popular education ; and is the author of several books . He was first elected President in 1920 , and again in 1924 . I was presented , with three other persons , to the President by Mr. Washburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed around a table in the corner of the pleasant , unostentatious room in which this presentation took place , the President entered literally into a round-table conference with us : a benign , elderly man , with a white beard and shrewd kindly eyes illuminating a pale and rather tired face which was strangely gentle and at the same time strangely strong ; a man of patience , endurance , charity , intelligence , whom both parties in Austria have combined to elect and reelect and retain a man  | of the people , in something the same sense that Lincoln was a man of the people ; a man whose burdens Lincoln would have understood and appreciated . He invited us to question him , but indeed little questioning was necessary , for he talked with fluency and freedom , first , very naturally , about the riots , and then on more general subjects of national and international concern : of the problems of peace and how to meet them ; of the possibilities of war and how to meet those . He spoke of Austria 's enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length and with enthusiasm of a trip he had once made to America ; and , leaving all question of politics aside , of his mother , and of a flight she had recently taken with him . " She has long been eager to go up in an aeroplane , " he said , " so I planned a short and easy ascent for her ? over the city of Vienna . But this was not long enough to suit her . When the time came to descend again , she wished to go on indefinitely . She was enjoying herself immensely . " The morning was slipping away so fast , in the course of this agreeable conversation , that at last I turned to the secretary who had " assisted " at the conference ? Mr. ' Washburn had long since excused himself because of other important appointments ? and asked if the " Herr President " would dismiss us when he wished us to leave . " It is the custom in our country for the President to do this , " I explained , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , never ! " exclaimed the secretary . " He never dismisses his guests . Only when you shall tell him you shall go , shall he say farewell . " When we reached the antechamber and saw the number of persons patiently waiting for our visit to end , our consciences smote us because we had not acquainted ourselves with the differences in Presidential customs somewhat earlier ! But there was nothing in the Herr President 's manner to make us feel that we had overstayed our welcome ; and the memory of his simple and gracious presence will linger in my memory as long as I live , together with the sense of privilege in having met him . Received by the Chancellor The other prominent personage with whom I wish you to become acquainted is , as you have doubtless guessed , Monsignor Seipel . For the crowning event of my stay in Austria was my audience with this man , who , born of humble parents , became first a simple priest and then a college professor , teaching and writing at the Universities of Salzburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " brought him to the attention of Emperor Charles , under whom he served as Minister of Public Welfare , and to whom he remained faithful until the very end of the ill-fated empire . In I922 he became Chancellor of the infant republic , a position which , with slight interruptions , he has held ever since , being also charged with the direction of Foreign Affairs and of the Department of the Interior . The consummate skill and delicate art with which he has worked for the economic and political reconstruction of Austria have made him the undisputed leader of the Nationalist party ; and his triumph over recent events have caused him to become an outstanding figure in all Europe . My presentation to the Chancellor , like my presentation to the President , was made by Mr. Washburn , but on this second occasion no one else was received . The Minister and I were ushered into a very beautiful and formal drawing-room in the famous Bandehaltz , the severity of its high white-paneled walls relieved by gilt tracery , its gilt furniture upholstered in pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private office , the apartment which was similarly used by his great predecessor Metternich , and which is known as the " Maria Theresa Room " from the superb portrait of the great empress  | which hangs in the center of its yellow-brocaded wall ; while beyond is the famous conference chamber used during the Congress of Vienna , with the five large doors through which the representatives of the five participating powers entered simultaneously for their meetings , in order that none might consult without the others . Into these historic chambers the Chancellor afterward took us , himself ; but the first greetings were exchanged in the reception room which I have described , and which he entered from his study unattended . He welcomed us without ceremony ? as calm , as erect , as ruddy , as dignified , as I was later to see him at the opening of Parliament , and dressed in the same simple black clerical garments ? but , of course , more smiling and more unbending than on that formal and solemn occasion . " It is my great pleasure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using that customary form of salutation which is so much more beautiful than that of any language with which I am familiar ? it makes me feel like striving to really deserve the title , " gracious lady , " every time any one calls me that ! And then he spoke , of my travels and of my writings in such a kind way that I was greatly embarrassed and not ff a little touched , and registered an inward vow to try harder than ever to make both worthy of praise . " I congratulate you upon coming to keep your appointment with me , " he said ( the date of the audience had been fixed by cable about a fortnight earlier ) , " for I am sure you have just been told in London that it was not safe for you to proceed , is it not so ? And that I would have been forced to resign before you reached here , so that it was hardly worth while in any case , and all that ? Ah , yes ! I thought as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope , at your hotel , and quite free to go about the streets , as you observe , and we are very glad to see you . " Of course , we spoke of the riots ? every con-. versation in Vienna this last fortnight has begun with that subject ! ? and naturally the Chancellor spoke of them with great feeling and regret , though deprecating any attitude which would magnify their lasting importance , and calling my attention to the fact that Austrian currency had not undergone even a temporary fluctuation ? always a significant indication of a country 's stability . But it was not to talk of riots that I had come all the way from London to talk to Monsignor Seipel . It was because he is the most famous figure in the world today who occupies a position of great political importance and who possesses great temporal power , who is also an ecclesiastic ; whose practise of the rites of the religion of his church is as constant and as faithful as it was in the days of his obscurity ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell which would be invaluable to you and to me . The Value of Religion I was neither disappointed nor mistaken . Monsignor Seipel slipped into the subject which I had hoped he might discuss with ease and earnestness . " You must not suppose , " he said , " that there are not many times when I think of my former peaceful life and wish that I might return to it . But I know that is a selfish wish , and therefore I strive to make it a temporary one . For it is here in the Bandehaltz , and not in seclusion among my books , that I can best help my country and worship my God . Men ? and women ? are called upon to serve in different ways , and they must serve where and as they are most needed . Otherwise they are not true to their religion . " That my religion has been a source of the greatest strength and comfort to me , that it has been the mainstay of my life , a very present help in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just passed ? and the power which has helped me to such success and triumph as I have attained , I do not need  | to say to you . But this one point I should'like to stress , Gnddige Frau ; I have never seen the time when my religious life and my political life were incompatible . Each sustains and illuminates the other ; they are complementary ; they are , for me , indivisible . " And this , my dear cousin , is , after all , the really import at message that I want to send you from Austria . I have tried , though describing them to you as fully and as accurately as I knew how , to convince you that the permanent gravity of the recent disturbances has been exaggerated ; and certainly they carry no message which I feel that I must share . I do not dare to try to predict the probable eventual fate of Austria , for that is something that no one should do without long residence and deep study , and even then it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutilated nation , economically unbalanced , surrounded by unfriendly frontiers , without a seaport , inevitably contains elements of uncertainty . Yet I believe the solution will come , and I hope it will come through internal reforms and international alliance , and not through annexation and loss of national entity ; and hope still more that the United States I will do her fair share ? and a little more than that ? in holding out a helping hand meanwhile . But more than this I shall not venture , and so ? as I realize very well , I have no message for you on that subject . But in the words and in the life of the Chancellor of Austria there is something permanent and priceless which will be no less valuable even if the days of his power should pass . There is the challenge to take our religion beyond the doors of our churches and chambers , and , having done this , to prove , by the uprightness of our conduct and the depth of our faith , that our religion is not incompatible with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lives incompatible with our religion . We may not all succeed in doing this so significantly as Monsignor Seipel has ? in fact , it is probable that few of us will . But the mere fact that we have tried will help us along the road in the direction of such success , and I know that our endeavors will be blessed . Always affectionately yours , Frances Parkinson Keyes
