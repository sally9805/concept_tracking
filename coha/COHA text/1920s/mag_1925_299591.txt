In a book of memoirs published in Russia by Sergius Tschoudnovsky was described the last moments of Admiral Kolchak and his able comrade , General Pepeliayev , the two leaders of the Siberian White Army that tried to smash the might of Bolshevism . Tschoudnovsky , as Chairman of the Investigation Committee , was commissioned , in 1920 , their executioner . <P> It was on the night of Feb. 7 that Tschoudnovsky , accompanied by Red soldiers , went to the prison to inform the captives of their immediate execution . Admiral Kolchak was in his cell , fully dressed under a fur coat , and wearing a Cossack hat . He was expecting rescue at the hands of White forces under General Kappel , who was not far distant . <P> Wrote Tschoudnovsky : <P> I read to him the death sentence . He remained silent for a minute and then firmly replied , " Why without a trial ? Will there be no trial at all ? " <P> I responded with a counter query , asking since when had he become a convert to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was left unanswered . <P> Kolchak silently obeyed orders and followed me to the prison office . <P> Then I went for Pepeliayev . He , too , was dressed and sitting on his iron bed . He broke into convulsive sobs while listening to the death sentence . Having recovered his composure , he expressed surprise , declaring he had made peace with the Soviet regime and addressed a petition to the Central Executive Committee , asking for a reprieve . He begged us not to shoot him until the executive 's reply came . I informed him this was impossible , and took him to join Kolchak . <P> While the latter conducted himself with the utmost indifference , Pepeliayev remained in a state of collapse , sobbing loudly , till the last minute . <P> While in the prison office Kolchak asked permission to see the Princess Timireva , first stating that she was his wife , but immediately afterward explaining " She 's not wife , but she is a good woman who was in charge of the lingerie department of my armies . " <P> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , the soldiers could not help meeting such a request with a hearty laugh . <P> We arrived at the spot , carrying out the sentence near the river in the small morning hours . I addressed my soldiers , pointing out to them the significance of the situation , and gave the command . The volley was fired and both leaders fell dead . " <P> Kolchak refused to have his eyes bandaged . <P> The question then arose what to do with the bodies . The soldiers suggested that they deserved the same fate as thousands of workmen and peasants whom Kolchak had assassinated during his punitive expeditions . <P> We towed the bodies to the river , cut the ice and threw them into the water .
