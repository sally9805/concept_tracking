txt Armour Co. say : " From the viewpoint of meat packers and live stock producers , the meat business for 1919 in many respects was a disappointment . " Prices for livestock advanced during the first half of the year in ' the expectation of heavy foreign business , hogs reaching the record figure of $23.60 a. hundred on July 31 . " There were large shipments abroad and indications of an almost unlimited demand for meats , fats and live stock . Failure to adjust credit for European buyers interfered with this anticipated foreign business . The demand for American meats existed and still exists , but the rate of exchange has been so unfavorable that over-seas purchasers dropped out of the market to a considerable extent . " This and other causes brought a decrease in the value of all meat products during the last half of the year , until at the close of 1919 they were about 30% less than they were a year ago . Sales of the accumulated stocks of last year were made on a falling market . " Agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the wholesale meat business  --  proposed radical legislation , sales of foodstuffs by the Government , strikes and industrial unrest all had their effect in lowering the price of packing house products . " Armour S. ? Co. did a large volume of business last year , but at a smaller margin of profit . Much of our meat business was conducted at a loss . " While this drop in prices may have been welcome to the consuming public , nevertheless consumers ought to bear in mind that if it is due to uneconomic conditions , it will react against the producers of livestock and cause them to reduce their herds , so that in the long run a shortage of material will result in higher prices for meat . " It is our opinion that until we remove the =use for high costs in producing cattle , beef necessarily will be higher than in preceding years . " We are hopeful that conditions in the meat-packing business will mend as soon as a peace treaty has been signed and satisfactory credit arrangements made for European buyers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for surplus products from American farms .
