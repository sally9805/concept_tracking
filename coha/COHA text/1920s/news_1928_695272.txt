txt Timely Letters to the Editor From Readers of The Times on Topics in the News TALKING MOVIE , MAY BRING CHANGE IN QUALITY OF MUSIC Musicians Who Fear Unemployment Might Break Away From Tiresome Jazz , It Is Suggested To the Editor of The New York Times : I have noticed with interest the published objection of an officer of the Musicians ' Union to the talking movie and their fears for its unhappy effect on the employment of ? rausicians . It is the ancient tale of attempting to block progress by protest . King Canute attempted to stop the advance of the tide by his command , but without effect . Protests against the talking movie will be just as ineffective , if the talking movie meets and keeps public approval . The remedy . for the unhappy situatiou which the musicians foresee , lies largely with themselves , as is usually the case in similar situations . How many consider the average orchestra or jazz band to be real musicians ? One can usually , but not always hear vastly better and more harmonious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better radio stations . Slowly , but surely constant repetition on the radio is killing the tin-pan variety of jazz , with its frequent raucous accompaniment of songs . Music Lovers Satiated . People who like music and not mere syncopated noise are more than fed up on the stuff that comes over the radio , as so-called dinner and dance music . It takes a lot of artificial conviviality to get anything like enjoyment out of it . It is nothing for an intelligent sober person In his or her right mind to grow enthusiastic over . There are just a few orchestras playing popular music which do not murder it and make it a mere medley of discordant sounds comparable to the music of savages , but most of our hotel and radio staff orchestras are not to be included among their number . If the musicians are becoming fearful for the future , it is largely because of the fearful stuff they are perpetrating on the public .

It is up to the composers and musicians to lead the way back to music which is enjoyable to listen to , as well as to dance to . Thus , if they will perform it decently , leaving out the all too usual saxophone and banjo gymnastics , and worse vocal efforts , perhaps the talking movie will not entirely uproot and replace the orchestra . Those of us who storm in our homes regarding the prevalence of such " music " on our radio programs must also share some of the blame . Radio program directors and advertisers who utilize radio programs are just as sensitive to criticism and praise as are the makers of the clothing we wear and the automobiles we drive . If those who disapprove this kind of music and the Usual pandemonium of mere noise which constitutes a good part of our radio programs would make it emphatically known by large numbers of letters or cards addressed to their favorite radio stations , the wishes of the majority would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N.

HOOVER AND PROSPERITY One Disagrees With Professor Fisher 's Reasons for His Preference Professor Irving Fisher of Yale has announced his preference for Mr. Hoover on the ground that the Republican nominee is " a practical economist " and " one to whom is due more largely than to any other one man improvement in our prosperity . " Professor Fisher is delightfully vague as to the manner in which Mr. Hoover has made this improvement , and also as to how Mr. Hoover will continue to make our country more prosperous in the future . Perhaps , after all , Mr. Hoover is being used by Professor Fisher to build up another of his explanations of prosperity . For the professor has the happy faculty of changing his views as to the causes of prosperity . During the period 1911-23 Professor Fisher believed that the interest rates lagged behind price movenm-nts and that this lag accounted viten prices are rising for the in ( ( ease in the profits of business men %vs.o had borrowed capital , and also tor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " Purchasing Power of Money , " 1911 , Chapters IV and XI , Sections 15-17 . ) In December , 1923 , Professor Fisher wrote " that the principal force affecting the cycle is the real rate of interest , the sum of the money rate of interest and the rate of appreciation ( positive or negative ) of the purchasing power of the dollar . " ( See Journal of the American Statistical Association , Volume XVII , p. 1024 . ) In 1925 Professor Fisher modified his ideas . " The " business cycle no longer existed . But fluctuations " in trade " are due primarily to " price change . " However , he can not entirely desert his first love . for the next most significant factor " is probably that of the rate of interest . " ( See Journal of the American Statistical Association .

REMARKS ON UNEMPLOYMENT To the Editor of The New York Times : Meredith B. Givens ' assertion before the conference of unemployment , at Bryn Mawr College , that " the key to the problem of unemployment . is control and stabilization of employment by management , " shows either a very narrow conception of the problem or a deliberate evasion of the true underlying causes of unemployment . In the first place , what right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not organized  --  to demand of employers that they employ any one at all ? What right then , has society to demand that employers employ labor that they do not need or can not afford ? Industry , as it is carried on today , can not possibly employ every one even if every one were employable , which they are not . Mechanized industry today , without employing nearly the number of workers available , can produce more than it can possibly dispose of . The unemployed and underemployed , necessarily , are unpaid and underpaid , and therefore can not buy what they need . These two conditions together constitute a cause of unemployment that can not be overcome under the present system of industry . Miss Mary B. Gilson , before the same conference , said , " that every effort should be made to reduce unemployment to a minimum . " Just what amount of unemployment would be considered a satisfactory " minimum " ? Would Miss Gilson be satisfied to be numbered in that minimum ? The use of the word " minimum " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The right to work is a fundamental human right , and so long as even one human being is denied this right  --  no matter how poor in kind or quantity their work  --  that unemployed one is one too many . There is but one greater disgrace to us than unemployment , in this the richest nation in the world , and that is that we do not care . So indifferent are we as a nation , to this phase of human misery , that we have a Federal Department of Labor which is so inadequate and inefficient that it can not inform us even approximately as to the number of unemployed . Further than this , so indifferent to the pleadings of millions for work throughout the land are we that the two major political parties , whose presidential conventions have just been held , scarce mentioned the subject of unemployment instead of making it their principal issue .

OUR OWN ROADS NEED CARE To the Editor of The New York Times : It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pyramids , so of course I can not say how it has been treated since then , but I feel that some of our own roads are so bad that we should sweep our own doorstep before going as far afield as Egypt . Last Autumn I took the road to Niagara Falls . Every foreigner who comes to our shores is sure to take tnat road , and I can not find words to describe its ugliness . One passes through a labyrinth of small , squalid streets , and then past miles of black and sooty factories and power houses . And when one nears those narvelous falls , the park surrounding them is so badly kept , the pipeiron fence around it so rickety that one wonders , since the city of Niagara Falls seems too poor to keep it Iii order , whether the Empire State could not afford to spend some money on its upkeep . And when one crosses the bridge onto the Canadian side , going into that very beautiful park with its granite wall , and looks over at the hideous shore line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business of America seems to be only business ! And one thing more , may I suggest that the gentleman from Boston , Mass. , before he goes so far afield as Ghizeh , consider the Mohawk Trail , where every incomparable prospect has been allowed to be made vile by man .

Bushnell  --  I think his name also was Cornelius  --  told me that after Presidentl Lincoln had looked over the plans of Ericsson 's new ship Monitor and was leaving the room without saying much , his father said : " Well , Mr. President , what do you think of it ?

OLIVER KAMM Grosse Pointe , Mich. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Advised to Use More Care in Picking Attractions . To the Editor of The New York Times : Mr. Rickard is complaining because he took in only $650,000 or so on a recent exhibition . He says he lost money , and he ascribes this to the radio broadcasting of the fight . He might better ask himself where the public interest comes from that resulted in giving him even a beggarly $650,000 and then he 'll put away the axe that he is sharpening for the poor geese that lay him golden eggs . Newspaper publicity has made the fight game profitable , as it has made all professional sport profitable , even such idiocies as dance marathons and bunion derbies . Before the newspapers took the fight game up it was a clandestine affair , and $5,000 was a thumping big gate . If the newspapers stopped their ballyhoo , what would happen to the fight game ? Mr. Rickard can answer that like a shot . Let him then ask himself if it is a mere coincidence that his million dollar gates came in with the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Johnson-Jeffries fight for the fistic and racial championship of the world and its environs ; and that fight was strenuously ballyhooed by the newspapers , and yet the gate was nothing like the one he complains of . Now , with the euphonious voice of Mr. substituted for the labor of reading , the entire moron population of the civilized world may be ballyhooed . Millions who ca n't read or who have to wiggle their lips while reading ; millions who can read but who lack the normal power of sustained attention , listen to the tones and discover in themselves an interest in fighting . Mr. 's vivid description of the steady deterioration of Mr. Heeney 's nose was peerless advertising and will win Mr. Rickard a fortune when noses are again to be battered . The trouble with the recent fight is that comparatively few people cared to pay $25 or $40 to see either Mr. Tunney or Mr. Heeney walloped on the nose . He did not have the attraction . I could send Mr. Rickard a list of people , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Tunney I would pay $25 to $40 . The next aviator to fly the ocean would be on my list , to be introduced to Mr. Tunney by Grover Whalen with all the honors of war . The man who invented the infernal outboard motor would be on my list ; the man who puts New York 's garbage on the beach before my house here every morning . Other fight fans have lists of their own , and Mr. Rickard should call for suggestions , because that is what put his latest venture in the red . Nobody cared to see Mr. Heeney walloped on the nose ; nobody knew him , and it is probable that if peep ' had known him they woUld hoe o liked him . It is silly of Mr. Rickard to blame his predicament on the radio and not on his own miscalculation a the public demand . Let him stop broadcasting . Let him go the whole hog and stop newspaper reporting of his queer business . And then , with not only the public 's money withheld from him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibiting laws will be passed , prize fighting will be again on the plane of dog fighting and Mr. Rickard will be pathetically glad to get a $5,000 gate for an attraction intrinsically equal to David and Gol:ath . There 'll be no more battles of the century nntp for a rineside seat . that 's sure . THOMAS . Ocean Beach , N. Y. , July 29 , 1928 . APHORISMS .

" " Familiarity breeds contempt " refers to familiarity in the active voice .

" Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added , " or , as J. W. D. says it ought to be , " Seek first the almighty dollar , " means nothing unless the seeker find what he is looking for . Also in interpreting this maxim .7 . W. D. tumbles into the popular error of applying it individually . The pronoun " ye " shows this to be a collective proposition .

ANOTHER CONSTITUTIONAL POINT ON THE PROHIBITION AMENDMENT The Right of Even the Supreme Court to Override Its Own Rules of Construction Is Questioned To the Editor of The New York Times : The interesting and vital discussion of the two-thirds provision of the Fifth Article of the Constitution between . Jesse F. Orton and Eliot Tuckerman moves me to suggest that the more important question is the right , even of the Supreme Court of the United States , to read into the fundamental law a provision which overrides the rules which that court has itself laid down for the construction of the Constitution , and to make It mean something different from its plain and unan biguous language . The eo-called Eighteenth Amendment rests upon a mere declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 350 , 386 ) that the two-thirds vote in each house which is required in proposing an amendment is a. vote of two-thirds of the members present ? assuming the presence of a quorum ? and not a vote of the entire membership , present and absent . The only authority cited for this proposition is Missouri Pacific Ry . Co. v. Kansas ( 248 ' U. S. ) , where it was held that a veto by tae President could be overridden by two-thirds of a quorum , relying upon the provision a section five of Article I , that " a majority of each ( house ) shall constitute a quorum to lo business . " The court says " the question depends upon the significance of the words , ' that house ' ; that is , whether these words relate to the two houses by which the bill was passed and upon which full legislative power is conferred by the Constitution in the case of the presence of a quorum ( a majority of the members of each house ; ? 5 , Art . I ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be assumed to embrace , not a majority , but all its members , for the purpose of estimating the two-thirds required . " The Intention of the Framers . If the court had read the first article of the Constitution in the light of the rule laid down in Lake County V. Rollins ( 130 U. S. 662 , 670 ) and followed in Yerke v. United States ( 173 U. S. 439 , 442 ) ; Caminetti v. ' United States ( 242 . U. S. 470 , 485 ) . and United States v. Standard Brewing Co. ( 251 U. S. 210 , 217 ) and many other cases , that " the object of construction , applied to a constitution , Is to give effect to the intention of its framers , end of the people in aciopting it , " and that it may be assumed " that the framers of the constitution and the people who voted it into existence meant exactly what it says , " it would hardly have made this assertion . It is not true that by section 5 of Article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution on the two houses , " in the case of the presence of a quorum . " TbA language of the first section is that " all legielative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the United States , which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives , " and the second section provides that " the house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several States , " upon a basis therein erovided for ; and the third section provides that " the Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State . " It is in these two houses consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate . which in turn are composed of definite members upon a mathematical basis , that the legislative powers " herein granted " are vested , and " a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business . " But this business is subject to the very important limitation , that " every bill which shall have passed the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes a law , be presented to the President of the United States ; if he approves he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it , with his objections to that house in which it shall have originated , who shall enter the objections at large on their journal , and proceed to reconsider it . If after such reconsideration two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass the bill , it shall be sent , together with the objections , to the other house , by which it shall likewise be reconsidered , and if approved by twothirds of that house , it shall become a law . " The language of the third clause relates to orders , resolutions , &c.,; " to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary ( except upon a question of adjournment ) " and as to these they " shall ' a presented to the President of the United States ; and before the same shall take effect , shall be approved by him . or being disapproved by him , shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " &c.; Not Full Legislative rower . Certainly a power thus limited is not " full legislative power ; " it is qualified by the veto , which is absolute if not overridden by " two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives , " and it deals only with the " legislative powers herein granted , " not with " full legislative powers . " That no competent authority exists for the construction that the Court has placed upon the clause providing for a quorum , is certain from all of the related clauses of the first article , which refer to " each house , " and provide that " with the consent of two-thirds " of the members of these houses , a member may be expelled . ( 5 , sub-div. 2 ; Growth of the Constitution , by Meigs , pp 923 . ) Speaking of the veto power of the President and tu the very point here under consideration , Justice Story ( 1 Story on the Constitution , ? 881 ) says : " In the convention there does not seern to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety of giving to the President a negative upon the laws . The principal points of discussion seem to have been whether the negative should be absolute or qualified ; and , if the latter , by . what number of each house the bill should be subsequently passed in order to become a law ; and whether the negative should in either case be exclusively vested in the President alone , or in him jointly with some other department of the Government . The proposition of a qualified negative seems to have obtained a general , but not universal support , having been carried by a vote of eight States against two . ( Journal of the Convention , 97 . ) This being settled , the question as to the number , was at first unanimously carried in the affirmative in favor of two-thirds of each house ; at a subsequent period it was altered to three-fourths by a vote of six States to four , one being divided ; it was ultimately restored to the two-thirds , without any apparent struggle . " ( Journal of the Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The first thing that offers itself to our observation , " says Alexander Hamilton , addressing himself to the ratifying conventions and the public generally , through The Federalist ( No. 73 ) " is the qualified negative of the President upon the acts or resolutions of the two houses of the legislature ; or , in other words , his power of returning all bills with objections . to have the effect of preventing their becoming laws , unless they should afterward he ratified by two-thirds of each of the component members of the legislative body . " Again , hi support of the qualified veto . in the same paper , he says : " This is a power which would be much more readily exercised than the other . A man who might be afraid to defeat , by his single veto , might not scruple to return it for reconsideration ; subject to being finally rejected only in the event of more than one-third of each house concurring in the sufficiency of the objections . * * * It is to be hoped that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proportion as twothirds of both branches of the legislature at the same time . " Again , in The Federalist ( No. 69 ) Mr. Hamilton says : " The President of the United States is to have the power to return a bill , which shall have passed the two branches of the legislature , for reconsideration ; and the bill so returned is to become a law , if , upon that reconsideration it be approved by two-thirds of both housee . " Black 's Opinion . Considering the question whether the provisions of Article V of the Constitution were legislative , calling for the action of the President , Black 's Constitutional Law says that this has been answered in the negative , and that the question is of no great practical importance , " because the concurrence of two-thirds of both houses of Congress is required to the proposing of amendments , and the same majority would be sufficient to override the President 's veto should it be interposed . " The language of the Constitution contemporaneous construction , the rules governing in the construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced and unnatural construction which makes two-thirds of a quorum sufficient to override a veto or initiate an amendment , and the Supreme Court , removed from the hysteria of a great war , will one day refuse to be controlled by that construction .

MOHAWK VALLEY HISTORY To the Editor of The New York Times : THE TIMM ; recently published an article entitled , " Mohawk Valley 's Place in History , " which described many famous landmarks . One is Inclined to ask if certain phases of history , which are written indelibly In the Mohawk Valley in letters of blood , are not worthy of note . I refer to the history of the Christian religion of New York State . It was on the banks of the Mohawk , near the present site of Auriesville , in 1642 , the same year , by the way , in which , according to your account , that Are nt Van Curler first visited Schenectady , that Isaac Jogues , priest of the Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , located where the Shrine of the North American Martyrs now stands . Father Jogues , the discoverer of Lake George and Lake Superior , was laboring among the Hurons in Canada when he was captured by the Iroquois . He had come to this country for the express purpose of bringing the Gospel to the Indians . But because of the savage nature of the Iroquois , little progress had been made in their conversion . To recount the story of the sufferings , tortures privations and maltreatment of ' Father Segues at the hands of the Iroquois would be to tell an oft-repeated tale . And yet there are few people acquainted with the manner in which Christianity was first preached in New York State . But there is no need of going into the story here . Suffice it to say that of all the landmarks in and about the Mohawk Valley none can and should take precedence over the cradle of New York State Christianity at Auriesville . THE Timms article speaks of some of the old houses in the Mohawk Valley . At the Shrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still in evidence . Just prior to the transfer of the property from the Putnam family to the Jesuits the palisade , which marked the boundary of the Long House , was plowed into the ground . But enough of . it remains to mark the outline of the Village of Ossernenon . An old resident of Amsterdam , who was formerly employed by the Putnam family , and later by the directors of the shrine , visited the shrine during the past month and described In detail the manner in which John Gilmary Shea , the historian ; General John H. Clark of Auburn , then the State Archaeologist and Surveyor , and Father Loyzance , S. pastor of St. Joseph 's Church , Troy , went over the history of the county and State , the Ontario Archives , the Jesuit Relations , and consulted the Indians in order definitely to establish the ' , cation of the spot where Father Jogues found an altar erected to an unknown god , only to demolish it and replace it by the cross of Christ . General Clark assured several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place of jogues 's martyrdom , that there was absolutely no doubt of the exact location of Ossernenon . At the time of General Clark 's survey of the present shrine property that eminent authority on the location of former Indian villages assured the men working with him that if they excavated in the places which he indicated certain Indian remains and relics would be found . The excavations , carried out under his direction , proved the truth of his assertions . The author of the article which you published describes graphically the Mohawk Valley as a " Pathway of Armies . " He does not state , however , the fact that from the village of Ossernenon , an army of missionaries went forth to bring souls to the feet of Christ , nor does he mention that-in the thirty years in which Ossernenon and its neighboring Indian villages were missions twentysix white men suffered untold hardships and suffering in an effort to make Christians of the savage Iroquois ; neither does he advert to the fact that not only did the Jesuits toil themselves , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own way , served to bring the faith to their pagan brethren . The history of the inception of New York State Christianity has been written by very efficient and authoritative hands . Beginning with the work of Father Jogues himself . when he sat , a slave of the Iroquois , In his rude hut and wrote with his mangled hands the history . geography and traditions of the Iroquois. right down through the work of Parkman and other fair-minded historians , to the present day , there is not one unsatisfactory link in the chain of deeds performed by the men whose first missionary labors In New York gave the impetus to the marvels which Christianity has wrought within the Empire State .

Kearns protested but Carpentier would not let him press it .

To the Editor of The New York Moue : Apropos of the phonograph records of American speech which are being made at Columbia University . there has been comment that if the records were made of conversation rather than of reading aloud , far more dialect quality would be preserved . This is true , and it might be added that syntax and choice of words , which are at least as important as pronunciation in determining dialect . are not tested by the method which we follow . Later we hope to be enabled to secure an apparatus that can be carried about to make records of conversation , if possible in the neighborhoods where the accents are purest . It seemed best to begin , however , by having a number of people from different parts of the country read in as lively a manner as possible the same words and phrases before a recording instrument of the greatest precision . The differences in vowel quality appear very clearly , and often , when the subject has rehearsed once or twice , the peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records afford a survey of regional differences which may be conveniently analyzed and presented .

This modest beginning has been made possible by the Victor Talking Machine Company and gifts from the Modern Language Association and Columbia ' University . CABELL GREET . New York , July 1926 , . OMISSION OF WORD ' BUT ' LENDS UNDUE POWER TO A QUOTATION Washington 's Remarks as Contained in the Republican Platform Is Not in Accord With Historical Text To the Editor of The New York Times : The law enforcement plank of the Republican national platform contains the following : " We reaffirm the American constitutional doctrine as announced by George Washington in his ' Farewell Address ' to wit : ' The Constitution which at any time exists until changed by the explicit and authentic act by the whole people is sacredly obligatory upon all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Presidents , " compiled by the late James D.

The very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established government . " Discrepancies Apparent . The italics are used to show the discrepancies in phraseology between the official version and the garbled quotation in the Republican platform , for the most part so inconsequential in themselves as to indicate a clumsy inaccuracy in quoting from one of the greatest of American political documents , and without improving the syntax of the original . However , the omission of the word " but " at the beginning of the - sentence tends to magnify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular occasion Washington clearly intended it as a corollary to the fundamental principle expressed in the preceding sentence , that is , the right of the people to make and to alter their " constitutions of government " as the " basis of our political systems . " None of the earlier statesmen did more than Washington to establish and maintain the Federal Constitution as the supreme law of the land , and it should not be considered necessary to misquote his Farewell Address to call attention to this fact. , In this case , as a matter of fact , the first President very clearly was referring , not to the Federal Constitution alone , but to the " constitutions of government " of the individual States as well . This is proved , not only by his use of the plural " constitutions. " but by the fact that In his messages to Congress , his proclamations and other State papers , including several references in the Farewell Address itself , he invariably spelled " Constitution " with a capital when referring to the Constitution of the Milted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1928 have kindly capitalized the word also , in their misquotation of the original , probably sympathizing with the inability of even George Washington to anticipate their exact phraseological requirements 132 years . ALBERT H. ROBERTS . Tallahassee , Fla. , July 30 , 1928 . A PLEA FOR DECENCY Clergyman Urges That an End Be Put to Campaign Vituperation To the Editor of The New York Times : It looks as if this Presidential campaign was going to be one of much bitterness , vituperation and slander . Not that the leaders either of the Republican or Democratic Party wish to have it such ; in fact , they are doing all they can to give it a different character . But the fanatics are determined that they shall not have their way in the matter and are doing their best to stir up the spirit of animosity by misrepresentation and abuse . The greatest sinners in this respect are the extreme drys , who are heaping no end of obloquy upon Governor Smith . as the Democratic candidate for the Presidency . The Southern dry convention recently characterized him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immoral . " These self-appointed defenders of the Constitution and the good name of the Democracy also accused him of " brazen effrontery and shameless political double-dealing . " It is of course unnecessary to defend the Governor against these false charges , as they will prove to be a boomerang to those who made them and will do him no harm . I heard not long ago a member of the Women 's Christian Temperance Union speak of the Governor as " that rascal , " a not infrequent way of alluding to him among these intemperate female champions of temperance , which shows how unjust their zeal for their cause can make them . Governor Smith may be a wet Democrat . bet he certainly is not a rascal . The Voice , Methodist organ of pro- hibition and public morals , by insinuation accuses him of being a beer guzzler himself as well as desiring to make everybody else one . A clergyman went so far in conversation with me as to declare that the Governor had been seen intoxicated in public , and I have heard others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and party zeal lead even good men to go in wronging a political opponent . But not only is the Governor subject to this campaign abuse , but his friends also . Everybody who is for the Democratic candidate for President is said by the drys to be in favor of booze and to be for him because they want it to drink themselves , which is a deliberate lie . A Protestant clergyman who dares to support the Governor openly is regarded with suspicion and strong disapproval by many church people . I have been told to my face more than once that I was a disgrace to the ministry for doing so . One of the fanatical drys In this town said that I " ought to be tarred and feathered , " and I have no doubt that there are others who are of the same opinion . If I am not lynched before next November it will not be the fault of these pious haters of the Governor . But is it not time to call a halt to this kind of campaign ? I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , irrespective of party , to frown upon it . Let us try to be more decent . ( Rev. ) JOHN P. EASTMAN . Avon , N. Y. , July 80 , 1928 . YOSEMITE FOREST CONDITIONS the Editor of The New York Tunics : The communication from Franklin W. Reed on the kubject cf the Yosemite National Park forests is one that should not be left unanswered . The best reply to it will be to call attention to things he avoids mentioning . In the first place he does not tell us that although logging in that national park may not be going on just at this moment , it may be begun again any day and certainly Will begin and be carried to completion soon unless action is taken to prevent it . This is no time for the public to go to sleep on the subject . He does not tell us that the larger part of the finest forests of the park are already gone and that extensive areas of its land are now the scenes of hideous desolation and destruction . He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yosemite Park have already made away with nearly one-third of its area . Does the nation want the park trimmed still more to facilitate private exploitation ? Certainly the difficulty of protecting the Yosemite Park would , as he puts it , be " settled for all time " if we should exclude from the park and turn over to private exploitation everything out of which a dollar could be made . But how much of a park would we have left ? The idea expressed that all that is needed in a national park is a " screen of trees " along the highways so that those who speed by in their cars will not notice the devastation and disfigurement of the rest of the area needs a little thought . Might it not happen that we would want to build more roads through the park ? What will the scenery along them be like then ? The big trees that are being cut are 500 to 800 , sometimes nearly 1,000 years old . What nonsense to talk of " reproduction " of such trees ! No power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten centuries . The Yosemite National Park is one of the nation 's most unique and beautiful possessions . We should be thankful for it and proud of it and protect it against vandalism for the personal profit of politicians , lumbermen and water-power interests . The suggestion in the commUnicatioit that there is economic necessity for its desecration is preposterous . The nation has over 158,000,000 acres in its national forests . Not a particle of excuse exists for destroying the few thousands of acres of timber that are needed to preserve the beauty of the grandest park in the world . WILLARD G. VAN NAME . New York , Aug. 1 , 1928 . SENATOR SHEPPARD 'S STAND To the Editor of The New York Times : United States Senator Morris Sheppard of Texas , author of the Eighteenth Amendment and one of the outstanding . figures in the prohibition world , has announced that he will support the candidacy of GOvernor Smith and Senator Roblneon for President and Vice Presideut , respectively . This announcement should put to shame the rule-or-bolt prohibition element within the Democratic ranks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thet Mr. Hoover is a rabid prohibitionist , and If elected will devote the major part of his time to the employment of none but prohibitionists in the rigid enforcement of the Volstead law  --  and that if Governor Smith is elected the open-saloons will at once appear on every corner and the breweries will run night and day . No man who ever ran for office has been maligned to a greater extent throughout the South than Governor Smith  --  his stand on the liquor and other public questions has been twisted and turned to fit the purpose of each spea7-.cr or writer . Men in the employ of the Anti-Saloon League are back of this propaganda and ? are working from within the Democratic Party . They are ably ae ? slated by the religious bigot . E. R. CHEESBOROUGH ..
