txt Copper has advanced easily from the recent low of 12/4 cents a pound to 11 cents , and as a result there is a more cheerful feeling toward the copper stocks . If the upward tendency of prices continues , copper shares are destined to show corresponding appreciation . Copper has been selling at 15% below pre-war level notwithstanding the great increase in cost of production since 1911 on top of a 100 , , I , increase in United States consumption and 20 ' " e in world 's consumption . Practically all the increase in production has come from old mines as aside from Katanga and Otavi in Africa no entirely new ore bodies of importance have been developed in the last 15 years . It would require more than five years to develop a new copper property to a point where it could produce any great tonnage of metal . Therefore consumers for several years to come will have to depend on mines already operating . A banker who has been buying good copper shares remarked that electrical development over the next 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in copper consumption . " Many large mines . " said he . " have reached their limit in production . Others can make little if anything on 13-cent copper . Under these conditions there is a lot of truth in forecasts of higher prices . " Consumption . which is at a new high record . continues to equal production , which is also larger than ever before . I do not understand why copper producers have been selling their product around 13 cents a pound when they could just as easily obtain 15 cents . ? " Producers like Utah . Chile , Cerro de Pasco , Braden , Kennecott , Calumet S. Arizona , Chino , Nevada Consolidated . Miami . Magma and Ray Consolidated came into existence as large producers over the last 10 to 20 years . Less than 20 years ago the great producers upon which consumers depended for supplies were Anaconda . Michigan mines like Calumet &; Hecla , and Clark and Phelps-Dodge properties . South America was contributing very little copper . But at that time development of great porphyry deposits was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars have since been spent in their development . O 1,11SC-0 VERY IN A DECADE " Now for the future  --  there has not been one great new copper discovery in a decade or more other than Katanga in Africa . No plans are under way for spendinq even millions to open up new copper deposits in the United States for the very good reason that there are no big prospects . " In the Belgian Congo the Kantanga Co. is opening up the lgrgest new tonnage of copper that has been developed in the last 10 years . This ore runs between 7 ' ; - and 155 , copper and averages between and 10 ' 7 , - . The individual ore ' bodies are comparatively small and far apart , and the mineral area hundreds of miles from the seacoast is a backward part of the continent . Costs are high despite the richness of the ore . Kantanga output will increase steadily in the next few years , but the company has yet to raise the capital for developing its concessions on an adequate scale . Otavi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to treat . Except for one or tv.o deposits in South America which are still in a development stage , no other new copper deposits of importance are known throughcut the world .
