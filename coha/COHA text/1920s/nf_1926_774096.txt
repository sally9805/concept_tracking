txt // Inasmuch as products change hands for a consideration , one of the most important questions concerns what and how much will be given by an individual in order to possess the thing desired . This naturally leads to a consideration of supply and demand , money and banking . With the introduction of money and credit , supply and demand , comes the problem of trade conditions and prosperity cycles . Few aspects of economics are more interesting and fundamental than that of value and price . The organization of markets , a part of the field of exchange , is one of the most popular questions of the ( lay . Several middlemen may stand between the product on the farm or at the plant and the person who may ultimately use it . The services rendered by the wholesaler and retailer are seldom fully appreciated . The product may be marketed under competition or under some form of cooperation , a present-day problem of interest to all . The vast systems of transportation lines , water , railway , and motor , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates charged and the service rendered become vital factors in costs . There is at this point another leading consideration in the location of industry . Tariffs and trade agreements may hinder or facilitate the exchange of products between nations , and consequently must be given some thought . 4 . The fourth large division of economics is distribution , not physical distribution , but the share of goods going to the various factors of production . L // What principles and conditions determine the returns of the land owner , wage earner , capitalist , and entrepreneur ? The results of production will naturally go to the economic forces that brought them into existence . We may speak of wages as the income of the laborer , of interest and dividends as the income of those who advance the capital , of rent and profits as the respective incomes of land owner and entrepreneur . There is no more fascinating field of study than that of distribution . It constitutes the discussion of the economic forces that determine the rewards for work done and risks undertaken . A broad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's interest in the subject matter which is to follow in subsequent chapters . Such an introduction also makes it possible to define economics as the science of the consumption , production , exchange , and distribution of goods . FUNDAMENTAL FACTORS IN PROGRESS. ? A business man is apt to interpret human motives and progress in terms of economic activity , a lawyer in terms of law and political organization , and a divine in terms of spirituality . As a matter of fact , every profession tends to interpret the past and predict the future along the lines of its professional interest and understanding . As a result , many reasons have been zealously advanced and defended in explanation of the existing civilization . There are few people who do not recognize religion as an important if not dominating force in the // progress of mankind . The spiritual content of a man or of a nation very largely determines respect for law and order , the strength of the family unit , regard for others , and the maintenance of industry and thrift . It is natural that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spiritual terms should measure the accomplishments of a given age by the prevalence and sincerity of devotion to God ; to them the primary factor is religion , all other conditions being secondary and subsidiary . A second group thinks in terms of nature and its attributes . Such an emphasis interests itself in the geography of a country . It asks about the area , topography , and fertility of the land ; the number , length , direction , and navigability of its rivers ; the timber , rainfall , and seasonal variations , and finally , the nearness and accessibility to other nations . With such an inventory on hand , the geographer builds a prophecy for the future . Tie growth of population as well as the mental attributes of the people will depend upon the area , fertility , climate , and transportation facilities ; the development and type of industry will be reflected in the mineral , timber , and agricultural resources ; even the nature of government will be determined by the natural subdivisions ; and finally , social relations will be limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and climatic conditions . Thus nature and her attributes become a prime cause and a world force to such a group of analysts . In other words , nature has largely set the stage upon which man must // exist ; the part he plays will be quite rigidly stipulated by his physical environment . A less popular but influential group of scientists has stressed the fundamental significance of the biological factor as a master force in human development . Biology has to do with the development of man , with the conception of life as a gradual process of adaptation of the organism to its environment . With this emphasis , interest shifts from nature to man ; from the stage to the individual . Such an analysis is interestd in the causes that bring about the survival of human types and deplores any interference with the domination of the fittest . It is easy to appreciate how the study of man would eventually lead to the study of man in social groups , and how thus the science of sociology was born . In a more recent period the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural environment and the body has stimulated a widespread interest in psychology . And so the biologist , sociologist , and psychologist find in their respective fields the fundamental thing , the essential factor in the progress of mankind . The power of law as a prime force in the advancement of the human race has been recognized . Such an emphasis begins with discipline as a factor in survival and leadership . It finds in law and order the basis for national strength and all forms of organized effort . It views man as a part of a political structure without which the adaptation to a given environment and the development of // man would be impossible . Without authority , discipline , law , and political organization , civilization would pass into chaos and decadence . Economics has not been without its zealous advocates as a factor of prime importance in the history of the world . It has been pointed out that man first eats and then philosophizes ; that the acquisition of food , clothing , and shelter constitutes the basis for civilization ; that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adaptation to our environment , but the character of our law and social organization ; and that all substantial advancement depends upon leisure , which is an economic factor . INTERRELATION OF FACTORS. ? It is not difficult to appreciate the above fundamental factors in a network of interrelation . Nature may , in the first instance , stipulate the conditions of social and political organization , industrial growth , and even the human type best fitted to survive , but on the other hand man is continually changing the conditions of nature . Rivers are made navigable , railroads and highways penetrate the wilderness , and canals cut the continents . Man may destroy the forests , but he also has the power to plant new ones . Even vast desert areas have been converted into compact farming communities by the development of irrigation . Likewise law and political organization may have much to do with the type and organization of industry ; our industrial development in turn has modified the law . There is no doubt // that the industrial growth of the last one hundred years has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate law . The influence of religion is seen in all human conduct . The relation of employer to employee , the care of the unfortunate , and the growing public service attitude of the progressive business man may well be interpreted as a part of the altruistic and spiritual endowment of all mankind ; and no one fails to see the influence of the present industrial age upon religious institutions . For the average man it does not matter much which factor is primary and which is secondary , or which factor is antecedent to the other . Each fundamental cause produces a result , which in turn changes and modifies the cause . These important factors are closely related and no greater mistake could be made than to attempt an interpretation of an existing development in terms of any single force . It is important for the student to begin the study of economics with due regard for all the conditions which may modify economic conclusions , with respect for the broad vision necessary to analyze industrial problems , and with gratitude for the contributions of others . WHY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of reasons why it is helpful , not to say necessary , for the student of banking to have a knowledge of the principles of economics . 1 . The first is a question of citizenship and applies to every one , whether banker or not . Most of T // the political questions of the day are fundamentally economic in character , and in order to vote intelligently , one must understand the economics involved in these problems . The protective tariff is a case in point . The citizen can not possibly decide whether to vote for low tariffs or high tariffs unless he understands how economic forces operate in bringing about the welfare of the nation . Furthermore , the government has definitely entered the field of business and industry by owning and controlling some of our public utilities . How is one to understand whether the government 's actions are wise unless he understands the economics involved in the operation of public utilities ? 2 . Students who arc eager to gain a wide and comprehensive knowledge of banking and the principles of its operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading universities , where courses in banking are taught , economics is always a prerequisite for the more specialized courses . 3 . The banker guarantees the future existence of goods . He is the manufacturer of credit . When he lends money , some security is usually offered by the borrower to assure ultimate payment of the debt . But no banker can succeed unless he lends money to those men and for those enterprises that produce goods and services at a profit . Banks do not intend nor wish to cash the securities taken when making loans . This is done only as a last resort . Therefore , the successful banker must decide whether or not the money loaned will be used in such a way that // the borrower will be able to repay him from actual profits . To do this he must have a knowledge of the laws of demand and supply , which are the very heart of economic science . 4 . The business world seems to move in cycles . Each cycle contains a normal period when prices , wages , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be about the average . This is followed by a time of increasing business activity , accompanied by rising prices and later by an increase in the rate of interest and of wages . This time of prosperity usually culminates in a crisis and a panic which brings upon the country some months of business depression . It is with difficulty that the nation slowly regains the normal position from which it started . So the cycle is completed . The evils of a fluctuating price level are very great ; if changes are not foreseen and discounted , the social evils arising from them are intensified . The hope of the future lies in the banks . It is possible for the bankers , in conjunction with the Federal Reserve System , to reduce overproduction and overexpansion of credit by controlling the rate of interest . But to accomplish this very desirable end , the bankers themselves must be familiar with the laws which affect prices and price levels . Economics greatly contributes to such knowledge . 5 . A banker should know and understand how exchanges of goods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media of exchange . Each individual really lives , in this age of specialization , // by producing one thing and exchanging that thing for products of others . Barter is clumsy ; money is necessary . The supply of money and credit flows through the bankers ' hands a number of times a year . Many banks have the privilege of issuing bank notes which contribute to the total supply of money . No banker can perform this difficult function of assisting in the exchange operations of the world ( for the world is rapidly becoming one market ) without understanding the principles which govern exchanges . Economics studies these principles . 6 . The banker is the friend and adviser of his clients in the matter of investments . In order to give the right kind of advice , he should understand the nature and functions of the leading industries of his country , including railroads , coal , iron , farming , real estate , and merchandising . The central problem of these industries and of all others is price determination through demand and supply . Economics is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake for students of banking to consider their profession concerned exclusively with technique and method . Although banking practice is a necessary part to be learned , the banker who makes his full contribution to social welfare must have the broader and deeper knowledge of economic life that economics , more than any other one subject , will give him . CHAPTER I Consumption HUMAN wants are the beginning of economic activity . Man does not work for the fun of working , but in order to satisfy his wants . Certain wants , such as the desire for food , for shelter , and for objects of worship are fundamental . As a people advances in civilization , these wants become complex , but in spite of their complexity , the fact remains that they are the driving force for all economic activity . SIGNIFICANCE OF CONSUMPTION. ? Consumption plays a much more important role in individual and national welfare than is generally assumed . For more than one hundred years much attention has been given to the standardization of production , while relatively little thought has been devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent that the habits and standards of the consumer are determining factors in his welfare , but it has not been sufficiently emphasized that these very habits determine all productive endeavor . Even a change in style may have a far-reaching effect upon entire industries . Changes in women 's apparel and in hair dressing have brought several lines of business to a standstill . Such changes have an important bearing upon employment and investments . The low-shoe style of recent years has brought about changes in shoe production , and has left retailers with stocks 29 // that have had to be sacrificed . Modern advertising is daily awakening new desires , multiplying existing wants , and entirely changing the nature of our standards of living . Consumption not only regulates production , but it has a pronounced effect upon the distribution of the product in terms of wages and interest rates . As we shall see later , wages are determined by several economic forces , among which is the manner of living on the part of the laborers . Every worker has established a method of living to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always be glad to have more , but he will not accept less save under severe pressure . It has been said that when wages and salaries are reduced without a corresponding reduction in the prices of things that make up the accustomed standard of living , a man is apt to become either a hero or a derelict , a hero in the sense of readjusting his manner of living , a derelict in the sense of giving up a job or a position . At any rate , the standard of living has an important place in the bargaining power of the laborer . Fully as important is the relation of consumption to the supply of capital . The amount of saving is dependent upon the living habits of the consumer . Individual and national welfare are stimulated by the amount that is periodically set aside for the future . Anything that encroaches upon well established habits of economy restricts the capital fund and affects the flow of income going to the various factors of production . // TWO OUTSTANDING CHARACTERISTICS OF HUMAN WANTS. ? Among the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two outstanding characteristics which are common to all such wants . 1 . The first of these characteristics gives rise fr to what is known in economic science as the law of diminishing utility . Each want tends to diminish in intensity as it becomes progressively satisfied . The result is that man will not make as great sacrifices to obtain more , as he will to obtain some , of a commodity . This characteristic may be stated briefly as follows : The more the individual has of anything , the less he is willing to give or to sacrifice in order to acquire more of it . This law has a distinct bearing on human development , for if there were not a diminishing utility in human wants , men might spend their entire lives in gratifying one particular want and never turn to others . The objection may he raised to the foregoing statement that frequently individuals become so habituated to the use of certain commodities , as , for example , drugs and alcoholic stimulants , that as time goes on they want them more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this objection is that diminishing utility must be considered as operating at one particular time , and not over a long period . Again , some one brings up the question of the miser , stating that the more money he has , the more he wants . Most men do not desire money for its own sake but for what it will buy , and the miser is merely an exception to the // general rule . It is safe to say , therefore , that the law of diminishing utility is practically universal in its application , and has been operating since the foundation of the world . From this discussion it is obvious that any one want is satiable , and that when entire satisfaction of a want is obtained by any individual , he is not willing to make the sacrifice necessary to obtain more of the commodity which satisfies it . After the point of satiability has been reached , that which formerly was a utility loses utility altogether , and may even become a disutility . This point is reached much more quickly with certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use much more sugar than he can salt before reaching the point of satiability . This difference in the demand for varying amounts of commodities has a direct and important influence on human consumption , and will be discussed under the subject of Elasticity of Demand . 2 . The second outstanding characteristic has to do with the multiplicity of human wants . Because any one want can be satisfied and tends to diminish with increasing supplies of the commodity which satisfies it , another characteristic of human wants appears , namely , their almost infinite variety . A simple illustration will show how wants multiply . The illiterate immigrant who comes to the United States has comparatively few wants , and these are for the most part physical . His son is educated in our schools and finally is graduated from the high school . The boy 's wants soon become numerous and // complex ; he desires books , pictures , games , good music , travel , and social fellowship . So it is a law of life that as one want is satisfied , many others spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of multiplicity of human wants . Civilization is dependent upon these two laws ? the law of diminishing utility and the law of multiplicity of human wants . As man 's wants increase , he is led to put forth greater effort to satisfy them . As they are satisfied , a hundred others spring into being , and so he advances toward higher and better things . On the other hand , it is also true that if the wants of any individual are base and low , the very satisfaction of those wants tends to bring into being other wants still more depraved , and so man may degenerate instead of advance . This is why it is so necessary for the youth of a nation to strive for the satisfaction of the higher wants rather than the lower . Another important application of the law of diminishing utility to multiplicity of human wants has to do with thrift . As a matter of fact , thrift might be defined as such an expenditure of income as will bring the most sane and reasonable utility . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to what is most sane and reasonable , yet every individual would do well to consider every expenditure in terms of utility . Such a habit might cause the individual to refrain from spending a dollar today in the light of its probable utility in years to come , or to hesitate in buying a non-essential as compared with an essential . // CLASSIFICATION OF HUMAN WANTS. ? According to their degree of necessity , the wants of man may be divided into three groups ; namely , necessities , comforts and luxuries . Necessities are usually considered to be those goods which are needed to keep human beings alive and well . Comforts are those commodities which , while not absolutely necessary to sustain life , are considered to be in keeping with the social standing of the individual . These comforts tend to increase the efficiency of those who enjoy them , even though indirectly . Luxuries may be defined as those satisfactions which , while pleasurable , are not essential to the economic and social well-being of man ; not only do they not increase the Jliciency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Expenditures for luxuries are usually considered to be " wasteful . " ) This classification , although it is of some use to the student of economics , has to be changed constantly to meet varying conditions at different times and in different places . The decencies or comforts of today were the luxuries of yesterday . The laboring man of the United States enjoys many satisfactions which kings did not have in the middle ages . Furthermore , what might be regarded as a luxury for one individual would be considered a necessity for another ; for example , an automobile might be a luxury for a bank clerk , whereas it is admittedly a necessity for a doctor . It is possible for the people of a community or nation to spend too large a proportion of their income for luxuries . When this occurs , so large a perSTANDARD // percentage of the productive capacity of the people is used in creating luxuries that the supply of essential commodities for the poor is relatively small and prices are correspondingly high . DOES WASTEFUL EXPENDITURE MAKE TRADE GOOD ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure is justified because it increases the circulation of money and gives greater employment to the laboring classes . This argument is unsound . If the capital and labor which are expended in producing luxuries were turned to the creation of a larger supply of necessities , society as a whole would be better off . In short , the argument offered in justification of wasteful expenditure takes for granted that labor and capital can not be utilized in any other way than in the reproduction of economic goods wastefully consumed . For example , in times of war , there is an increased demand for labor and capital for the manufacture of war materials . Wages and interest rise . Labor and capital engaged in the production of war commodities increase , and the output of peace-time goods is correspondingly reduced . The general price level rises more rapidly than does either wages or interest . It is usually the case in times of war that , in spite of higher wages , the standard of living of the unskilled laborer and of other classes on fixed incomes is reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation is used in making cannon shot and shell , warships , armies , and navies , the supply of wheat , sugar , leather , cotton , and so forth , tends to be less , and // society as a whole suffers . Only certain individuals profit by war expenditure , not society in general . The same is true of all forms of wasteful expenditure . The problem of wasteful expenditure may be approached in a different way . A $1,000 banquet for a party of ten gives employment to food producers , cooks , and waiters : And it may be assumed that an expenditure of $1,000 will put in a private irrigation system capable of bringing water to a forty-acre farm . Such an enterprise will also give employment to men who produce and install waterpipe . Evidently an equal though different type of employment is the result of either expenditure . The substantial difference in these two illustrations is to be found in the utility of the one expenditure as compared with the other . The $1,000 spent for the banquet will provide a usefulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the irrigation system will provide a utility covering a long period of years . A very effective method for determining the economy of a given expenditure is to compare its utility with the utility coming from some other use of the money . COMPETITION OF WANTS. ? The average individual has so many wants that he can not hope to satisfy them all . One want at any one time competes with another . A man may be in doubt whether to buy a new pair of shoes or to eat more expensive food , for if he buys the shoes , he will have to save on food . So throughout his life he is weighing the satisfaction to be obtained from one commodity // against the pleasure to be gained from satisfying another want . He will choose that want the gratification of which seems to give him the greatest degree of satisfaction . But not only is there competition between present wants ; there is also competition between present wants and future wants . The clerk on a meager salary is called upon to decide whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his money and take a trip to the seaside in his summer vacation . If he concludes to save his money in order to spend it at some future time , he is preferring future goods to present goods . The willingness to postpone gratification is a sign of self-control on the part of the individual and an index of civilization . Backward people prefer present goods to future goods , and it is very difficult to persuade them to save , even to protect themselves against the proverbial rainy day . THE USES MADE OF WEALTH ? CONSUMERS ' GOODS AND PRODUCERS ' GOODS . ? The individual may spend his income to gratify his wants immediately or he may put aside a part of it for the purpose of production . That quantity of goods which is consumed outright by society is called consumers ' goods . That part of the total income which is used for future production is called producers ' goods . The individual may save his money , not merely for the sake of future gratification , but for the purpose of investment which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If people use all their income to satisfy their wants immediately , // there can be no capital , because capital comes from savings . We shall discus producers ' goods in sub-sequent pages . ENGEL 'S LAW .  --  The study of statistics of consumption has been carried to a great length in various ; European countries and in the United States . In 1857 Ernst Engel , head of the Prussian Statistical Bureau , advanced certain theories , con-cerning the relation of expenditures to incomes , which have since become known as Engel 's Law . Statistics of consumption compiled by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics follow the general trend of conclusions based upon facts obtained from Europe. * The circles below show the distribution of expenditures for family income , ; under $900 per year and for family incomes of $2,500 and over . // The above statistical charts create the basis for the following conclusions which in a general way substantiate Engel 's Law : 1 . The greater the income the smaller is the relative percentage of outlay for food . 2 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3 . The percentage of outlay for rent decreases somewhat with the increase of the income . 4 . The percentage of outlay for fuel and light varies but little with the size of the income . 5 . As the income increases in amount , the percentage of outlay for sundries becomes considerably greater . A careful study of the above conclusions serves to bring out some of the important practical results which follow an increase or decrease in incomes . Anything which brings more income to an individual , family , or nation frees a considerable percentage of the wages or salaries for a better environment , more clothing , and miscellaneous expenses . In other words , the margin of cultural expenditure broadens considerably with the economic progress of a nation . There may be many forces that have a part in our civilization , but Engel 's Law constitutes a statistical measurement of the fundamental importance of the economic factor . WHAT IS A REASONABLE STANDARD OF LIVING ?  --  Many attempts have been made to construct a reasonable standard of living . As a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STANDARD ECONOMICS ployers or employees or both , as a basis for wage settlements . One of the first steps in such an ambition is to list both the quantity and quality of the things reasonably necessary to maintain what is sometimes referred to as American decency . Investigations do not proceed far in making categories of food , clothing , home furnishings , rents , heat , and light , before marked differences of opinion are encountered . Such surveys ultimately resolve themselves into compromises that are unsatisfactory to all parties concerned . If it were possible to establish by this method a reasonable standard of living for a given group of employees , the findings would be subject to constant revision due to changes in our economic well-being . It must be concluded that reasonable standards of living can not be determined by surveys and such surveys used as a basis for wage adjustments . SUMPTUARY LAWS. ? Past history has been filled with legislation aimed to regulate consumption , and such acts have been known as sumptuary laws . Several reasons have been advanced in justification of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of some products is highly injurious to the health and morals of a people . Naturally , much difference of opinion exists as to just what should be included in such a list . In ancient Greece women were forbidden to wear gold-embroidered clothes . The censors of early Rome punished all persons guilty of luxurious living . Expensive clothes and funerals were not allowed , and even the // number of guests at banquets was limited . The use of narcotics and dangerous drugs has been forbidden in many countries . In our own day in the United States the manufacture and sale of liquor is illegal , and in several states the sale of cigarettes has been made a violation of the law . In the second place , many desire to control expenditures for economic reasons . During the fourteenth century in England an act prescribed the various kinds of clothing the different classes might wear . History is filled with instances in which people were denied the enjoyment of commodities produced abroad . There are many in the United States who justify enforced prohibition upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discouraging the use of socalled luxuries is to levy an import duty or internal tax upon such commodities . It should not be assumed that the control of expenditures is a relic of the past . There are any number of people who believe in such restrictions upon the ground of either economy or morals . WASTE. ? Inasmuch as the largest percentage of income is spent for food and clothing , it is important that careful economy should be practised relative to these items . Much has been done in recent years by schools and clubs to reduce the waste in the use of food , but it still remains a fact that possibly as much as 10% of the family income is wasted in the unwise purchase and use of life necessities . This means an annual loss running into more than a billion dollars . Waste may be // brought about by the failure to select the proper food for the family , especially for children ; by the selection of needlessly expensive commodities ; by a disregard or ignorance of economy in the preparation of food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts and remnants that should be utilized ; and by losses in fuel due to inadequate ovens . Waste in the use of food does not comprise the only loss in our economic system . Loss by fire in the United States was well over $500,000,000 in 1924 , amounting to about four dollars and a half per capita . These figures are several fold greater than for western Europe through careless and inadequate construction as well as lax inspection . Of course the use of lumber in building throughout the United States is much greater than in other countries and naturally results in an increased fire hazard . The heavy loss of life in the United States through carelessness and sometimes by reason of inadequate protection must be viewed with great social and economic concern . Waste in agriculture , lumbering , mining , manufacturing , transportation , and marketing amounts to many billions of dollars each year . Such losses will be better understood as we proceed with the study of economics . CHAPTER II Production THE production of goods is the creation of utilities , not the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and man only changes them . In producing goods and services , three different kinds of utilities are created : form , time , and place utilities . When raw materials are changed into finished commodities , form utilities have been created . When goods are offered for sale at a time when they are especially required by consumers or producers , time utilities have been created . When goods are carried from one place , where there is abundance , to another where there is relative scarcity , place utilities have been produced . A simple illustration will make clear how these forms of utilities are created . Water is frozen by means of chemicals in the ice plant . During this process the form of the water has been changed to ice , that is , form utility has been produced . Our total supply of ice , however , is not obtained by artificial production ; some of it is harvested from the lakes and streams in the winter , and stored until the summer when it is sold to the people . In this instance , time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced alone ; the ice must be carried from the icehouse to the consumer , for it has no utility to the consumer until it is delivered at his door . So place utility is created . The storage and transportation 43 // of goods are production in as real a sense as is the changing of the form of goods . In other words , the warehouses and the railroads contribute to production just as truly as do the factories and the farms . From a broader point of view , we must also include storekeepers , advertisers , bankers , postal officials , and even policemen among the producers of wealth . Any one who satisfies a human want , even though it be through the mere rendering of an immaterial service , should be considered a producer . The actor , the musician , and the poet are creators of satisfactions , and so producers of wealth . Some wants of man , such as the desire for opiates , for unwholesome plays , and for depraved literature should go unsatisfied . Do those who satisfy such wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics does not raise the ethical question as to whether wants should or should not be satisfied . He merely states what occurs , and so he classifies all who put forth energy which results in satisfying the wants of mankind as producers , irrespective of whether these wants are uplifting or whether they are degenerating . THE PRODUCTIVE PROCESS OF PRESENT-DAY ECONOMIC LIFE. ? This is an age of specialization . Many men and women spend their entire lives doing one thing , which is oftentimes but one small act in the total productive process . Present-day production is often spoken of as " the roundabout method of production . " In other words , the production of goods is no longer direct and is no // longer performed by one or two individuals . The development of a finished commodity from the raw material has grown to be a long and complex process , and a large number of individuals have been drawn into it . To illustrate , the production of a plow begins with the mining of iron and coal ; the ore is carried to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is converted into pig iron ; the pig iron passes to the mill where it is changed into steel ; the steel is then carried over the railways to the factory where the different parts of the plow are produced ; after the parts have been assembled and the plow " built , " it often passes through the hands of the wholesaler to the retailer , from whom the farmer obtains it . It should be noted , that in each one of these stages , from the mine to the consumer , there are many other lines of production which cross each other . For example , in the steel mill there are many machines , each of which has its own line of development , from the point of origin of the raw material to the factory where it is used . Thus , modern industry is a complex network of productive lines which cross and recross each other constantly . One of the results of this complexity is that no one factor of modern production can be increased or reduced without reacting upon all the others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries of the whole nation . AGENTS OF PRODUCTION. ? As we have seen , there are four agents of production , namely , land , labor , capital , and enterprise . Each makes its // definite contribution to production , although no one agent could function without the presence of the other factors mentioned . Land LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES. ? The economist 's use of the term " land " is more inclusive than the popular use . In economics , land includes all natural resources , such as soil , water , air , minerals , and every other gift of nature which contributes to the satisfaction of man 's wants . The two principal characteristics of land are described below : 1 . Land is the source of all the raw materials of production . As already stated , man does not produce materials , but only changes them into forms of greater usefulness . On this characteristic of land , namely , that it is a free gift of nature and that man has done nothing to earn it , the single-taxers and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . 2 . Land is limited in amount . It is impossible to increase to any great extent the supply of land in the world . It is true that in Holland certain lands have been reclaimed from the sea . It is also true that in our own country , either by drainage or by irrigation , the amount of arable land has been greatly increased . But this is such a small proportion of the total that it does not seriously affect the truth of the statement that land is limited in amount . One result of this characteristic of land is that as populaSTANDARD // tion increases there is ever a greater pressure on the soil , and land values increase , even though the owners of the land have done nothing to improve it . Such increase in land values is called the " unearned increment . " Many countries consider this unearned increment to be especially suitable for taxation . PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF THE UNITED STATES. ? Few countries possess more favorable physical conditions than does the United States . The center of civilization at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe rather than in Asia . What is more , proximity favored settlement on the part of Europeans . The United States is also the nearest neighbor to South America and in recent years the Panama Canal has cut the distance between our east and west coasts and the west and east coasts of South America by thousands of miles . Even more important is the relative proximity of the United States to China and Japan . The development of South America and Asia is rapidly putting North America in the center of the world . Location is a dominating factor in the industrial and commercial progress of a nation . With a territory including 3,026,789 square miles , the United States must be ranked with China , Russia , Brazil , and Great Britain . Wealth in land area will always remain a dominating physical factor provided other conditions are equal . One of these conditions refers to the sea coast and internal communications . The United States stands next to Europe in the proportion of coast line to area . We // possess innumerable first class harbors on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five Great Lakes , connected with one another and in turn connected by natural and artificial waterways with the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico , furnish accessibility to the very heart of the continent . The Mississippi River with many navigable tributaries , together with innumerable rivers on the Atlantic , Pacific , and Gulf Coasts , facilitates exit and entrance to a vast empire . The surface features of the United States are also varied , accounting for transportation lines , the location of industry , and the distribution of population . If the human eye could look down and include the territory of the United States , a few striking physical features might be noted as fundamental to our economic development . The great central plain beginning at the Gulf of Mexico and extending north in a fanlike spread might be considered the dominating physical factor . This great valley might well be called the granary of the modern world . It furnishes lumber , minerals , cereals , hay , fruits , sugar , cotton , and tobacco . The Atlantic coastal plain constitutes the ledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded . The southern portion is adapted to agriculture with a special emphasis on cotton and tobacco , while the northern portion early became the center of our manufacturing industry . Two great mountain systems , the Appalachian and the Cordilleran , running north and south on either side include many spaSTANDARD // cious valleys rich in fertility and present great wealth in lumber , minerals , and power , as well as vast grazing areas . These physical characteristics of the United States have played a dominating role in economic advancement . The greater part of North America lies in the temperate zone , thus making it the home of the vigorous and progressive white race . The north and south trend of the mountain ranges is the main cause for a fairly even temperature from the Gulf to the Great Lakes . From east to west , however , the two oceans , gulf , mountain ranges , and vast continental plain produce a much more variable temperature . It has been said that north and south mountain ranges are generally rainfall breakers , and east-west ranges are temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States varies greatly , being heavy around the Gulf , Atlantic Coast , and Pacific Northwest , and lighter in the interior . The north and south mountains of the western half of the United States check the west winds , leaving a large area with a light rainfall . As a result of these most favorable geographical and racial conditions , the United States has been able to take economic strides that have astonished the entire world . A brief inventory of some of our leading basic commodities will prove helpful in appreciating the sources of American prosperity and at the same time will establish a due regard for conservation . LUMBER. ? From the time of the early settle50 STANDARD ECONOMICS ments in America timber has constituted one of the leading items of industry and commerce . The homes of the pioneers were constructed of logs and later of lumber ; likewise wagons and boats made possible the development of internal trade . Not only did the colonists have sufficient timber for fuel , homes , and domestic industry , but a considerable supply for export . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber and its by-products were sent abroad in large quantities . Lumber has always been a substantial part of our foreign commerce . In 1924 the value of lumber and manufactures of lumber exported amounted to $142 , - 876,000 . The original stand of timber in the United States has been estimated at 5,200,000,000,000 board feet . At the present time not more than one-third of that amount remains . Fifty per cent of the re-maining supply will be found on the Pacific Coast . Each year we use about 53,000,000 board feet , and over 7,000,000 board feet are destroyed by fires , in-sects , disease , and windfall . It is probably fair to say that the amount of timber annually wasted by fire and by cutting has a value of more than a billion dollars . That we are using our timber much more rapidly than nature can restore it is seen by the following table Table // There are several economic conditions which will act as modifiers of timber scarcity : 1 . In the light of the world demand for lumber the four primary timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Russia will not suffice for future needs . Consequently an increasingly larger number of substitutes for lumber must be used . At the present time these substitutes save approximately 300,000,000 cubic feet of timber each year . 2 . Reforestation must be depended upon to restore in part the forests of the United States . Government forestry service and state forestry departments are active in developing a program in keeping with the seriousness of the timber problem . 3 . A substantial economy can be brought about by the prevention of waste from fire and improper methods of foresting . Increased prices of lumber resulting from the depletion and inaccessibility of timber will provide more economy in the use of the existing supply and will stimulate greater care in the protection of the forests . IRON. ? The iron industry developed early in the American colonies and became a leading factor in the growth of the middle group . From the early part of the eighteenth century down to the Revolution pig and bar iron were exported to England . The use of iron is so general in present industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single barometer of economic conditions . In 1924 the pig iron production of the United States was about 31,000,000 tons . During the last seventy52 STANDARD ECONOMICS five years the per capita production has increased from fifty to approximately five hundred pounds . The total available ore supply in the United States is estimated at 4,700,000,000 tons . At the present rate of consumption high grade ores will be ex-hausted in the next twenty-five or thirty years . This means that in the near future this country must use low grade ores or import from other parts of the world . There has been much waste in the mining and use of iron ore in the past , but this has been greatly reduced , especially in the Lake Superior region . As the price of iron reflects the smaller supply , many substitutes such as cement and stone will come into greater use . It is also possible that new deposits will be discovered . But the fact remains that we can not look ahead indefinitely without regard for careful economy in the use of our depleted supply . COALIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in smelting pig iron in the United States . Smelting by charcoal continued for a long time because of the abundance of wood . At the present time the United States is the largest coal producer and has the largest available supply . The world 's coal reserve estimated by geologists in 1913 is given in the following table : The world 's production of coal was 1,350 million // tons in 1924 , of which the United States produced 39% . The production of bituminous coal was more than five times that of anthracite . During the last twenty-five years our exports of coal have increased rapidly , amounting to eighteen million tons in 1924 . Great Britain ranks first in coal exports and the United States second . Although the end of our coal supply is far away , much economy could be introduced in mining , distribution , and use . The United States Coal Commission reported in 1925 , " The wastes include waste in mining , found to average 35% of the coal in the ground ; waste through opposition of the union to increased use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time of the worker and of the capital invested in the mine through lack of coordination of underground work ; competitive wastes of transportation through needlessly long hauls , cross hauls , refusal of railroads to agree on joint rates , absence of pooling arrangements at yards , terminals , and lake and tidewater docks ; waste through too many middlemen , necessary as middlemen are ; waste in retailing , shown by the low costs of some retailers as compared with most others ; wastes in burning coal , by which small steam plants utilize only a fifth as much of the heat value in the coal as a good central electric station ; and , greatest of all , the tremendous waste of capital and man power in running mines only 200 days when they ought to be running 290 days . " COPPER. ? The fact that copper plays an im54 STANDARD ECONOMICS portant role in the modern industrial world is due largely to the development of electricity . It is practically impossible to estimate the total amount of copper resources , for this metal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver , gold , and zinc ores . The world 's production of copper in 1924 in short tons was as follows : * Table The above figures indicate that the United States produced more than 60% of the total copper output of 1924 . During this same year more than 300,000 tons of unrefined copper were imported and further processed , while our exports amounted to somewhat over 500,000 tons . Half of the refined copper is used for electrical apparatus and a large part of the remainder is the basic material in the manufacture of brass . Carefully organized large scale units and the high value of the product are factors that modify waste in the mining and production of copper . OTHER MINERALS .  --  - Nearly one-third of the world 's lead and zinc supply is produced in the Footnote // United States . In 1923 we produced 543,000 tons of refined lead and 508,000 tons of zinc . One-third of the lead is used in manufacturing paint and the prin-cipal uses for zinc will be found in the manufacture of brass and a covering for iron that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the leading producers of silver , 73,385 troy ounces being the out-put in 1923 . Gold production for the same year amounted to 2,500,000 troy ounces . PETROLEUM. ? The development of oil fields belongs to the present age and constitutes one of the most important of nature 's contributions . The fol-lowing table* shows the world 's petroleum output for the ten-year period 1912-1922 : // Each year is epoch-making in this industry , oil fields being extended and new ones being discov-ered . There are seven primary oil fields in the United States , the Appalachian , Ohio-Indiana , Illinois-In-diana , Mid-continental , Gulf Coast , Rocky Mountain , and Southern California . In 1924 these fields pro-duced 714,000,000 barrels . About 300 products come from crude oil , the most important of which are fuel and gas oil , gasoline , kerosene , lubricating oil , par-affin , and asphalt . The following table* is an estimate of the world 's petroleum resources : In 1924 the United States exported crude petroleum and its by-products to the value of // $502,432,000 and at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The consumption of petroleum , especially gasoline , keeps close pace with production . The fear of a shortage in this important commodity within the next few generations caused President Coolidge to appoint a Federal Oil Conservation Board to investigate the conditions of supply , production , distribution , and use of petroleum . The future problems include the conservation of proven reserves , the elimination of waste in drilling , production , and distribution , the importation of a larger supply from foreign countries , the utilization of coal in preference to oil , wherever practicable , and the development of substitutes from oil shale , coal , and organic distillates . HYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER. ? The real development of the power industry belongs to the last twenty-five years . General electrification by use of water saves the coal and oil supplies , and at the same time reduces the cost of light and power . The use of electricity is only in its infancy . Electrically operated household appliances are rapidly finding a way into American homes . About a thousand miles of railroads in the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical current . With increasing costs of coal and oil , together with the importance of power cost in transportation , a much greater application of electricity may be expected in the future . One of the great uses for electrical power will be found in the manu58 STANDARD ECONOMICS facture of fertilizers . More than one hundred million dollars worth of fertilizers are used annually in the United States . We import every year about six million tons of nitrates from Chile alone . It is said that the fertilizers produced by electricity contain 60% of active product and only 40% of waste . The air contains the nitrogen necessary for fertility , and we have an abundance of water power , so nothing should prevent the development of this industry . The future market is better appreciated when one compares the yield in bushels per acre in Europe , where the use of fertilizers is highly developed , with that in the United States , where their value is just beginning to be appreciated . Table The potential water power of the United States has been estimated to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount developed is about 10% of the total amount available . Over 40% of the total is in the Pacific Coast states and about 20% is in Montana , Wyoming , and Idaho . One reason for the slow development of electricity for industrial purposes is to be found in the concentration of power in the West . If this energy were located in Pennsylvania , New England , and southeastern New York , it would have a much more extended use . Footnote // AGRICULTURE .  --  Throughout the history of the United States agriculture has always ranked as the largest single industry . From the time of the first settlements forests were cleared away and grain , corn , beans , and vegetables raised . The great waves of westward expansion were little more than a repetition of colonial agriculture except for the fact that crops were larger and more varied . Flax , hemp , cotton , sugar cane , and tobacco became staple crops in the southern colonies and to this day remain , with the possible exception of hemp , the leading farm products . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshes constituted the grazing area for cattle , horses , sheep , and swine . These herds were constantly driven farther west , and in a way might be looked upon as the advance guard of western settlement . As land was cleared , hay fields became a part of each farm , and the introduction of timothy grass and clover revolutionized the stock industry . For many years the agricultural expansion of America was little more than a movement from old , soil-exhausted areas to the newer , fertile valleys and plains . But with an increasing population , better farm methods were developed and very slowly a more intensive cultivation took the place of the earlier primitive agriculture . Dairy cattle and poultry , fruits and vegetables , sugar beets , and alfalfa have done much to introduce scientific farming . The following table based upon figures furnished by the U. S. Department of Commerce shows the magni60 STANDARD ECONOMICS tude of our leading agricultural products for the year 1924 . Crop statistics and prices fluctuate greatly from year to year for which due allowance must be made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States is the leading agricultural country of the world , not only furnishing our own population with the leading foodstuffs , but exporting animal products and vegetable food products to the value of more than $1,000,000,000 in 1924 . There are large wastes in agriculture . For a long time it has been recognized that farming is a business requiring great skill and foresight . It is also fully appreciated that hard times and depressions in agriculture are frequent and severe . A brief // discussion of the causes for hard times in farming communities will make it possible to understand the technical nature of agriculture as well as the many plans now under way for assistance and betterment . First , the farmer never knows whether he will be able to reap what he sows . A late spring may delay planting and an early fall may not permit crops to mature ; droughts , hot winds , too much rain , or frost may destroy crops over a wide area ; and finally , plants and animals are subject to a score or more of destructive diseases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results from a given area without depleting the soil of its plant food . This means that the farmer must select the proper crops for each piece of land , being guided by soil and market conditions . Likewise , he must apply the proper amount of labor , working with the right kind of equipment , in order to obtain the largest profits . This is a delicate task requiring good judgment , long experience , and very often special training . Third , many products of the farm are marketed under keen competition not only within the United States , but with foreign countries . The wheat of Russia , Canada , Australia , and Argentina , the dairy products of Holland and New Zealand , the wool and meats of Australia , the sugar of Cuba , as well as many other agricultural commodities , compete with the output of American farms . Fourth , it is difficult to adjust the supply of farm products to the demand . When prices are unreasonably low for certain agricultural products , farmers do not quickly // curtail overproduction . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are in the habit of cultivating . On the other hand , when the prices for manufactured commodities drop below the cost of production , the supply is quickly restricted and prices go up . This is one of the chief reasons why a depression in agriculture is apt to continue for a long time . It has been fully demonstrated that the careful selection of seed must be regarded as one of the first steps in successful farming . It costs as much to prepare the ground and to sow poor seed as the more carefully selected kind ; expenses of harvesting are also about the same . But results in yield are entirely different ; so much so that one can say that the difference between profitable and unprofitable farming is very often the difference between good and bad seed . If one can raise as much or more on a smaller acreage , not only are the costs reduced , but a considerable amount of land is released for other crops . What has been said in regard to the quality of crops applies even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only the quantity but the quality of milk , not only the amount but the quality of wool that is important . For meat purposes it is necessary to select the kind of stock that will produce weight during a reasonable feeding period . Farm agents have conducted feeding demonstrations that show vastly different results when the proper type of animal has been selected . The good farmer knows // that it costs as much in labor and feed to keep " scrub " stock as it does to take care of the finer breeds . One of the urgent needs in agriculture is a system of farming that will bring an adequate , dependable , and continuous profit . Any single crop system is highly speculative and is unsound business . When a farmer plants a single crop he is putting all his eggs in one basket . It may easily happen that the climatic hazard will make it impossible to harvest either a normal quantity or quality . Or if a favorable season produces a large crop , the market may not be able to absorb a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of greater importance is the experience that the single crop system soon depletes the soil of its productivity . Many regions in the United States have had to be abandoned because of cultivating the same crop year after year . Diversified farming constitutes an insurance against heavy losses . One of the most successful methods of diversification consists in keeping the farm properly stocked with cattle , sheep , swine , and poultry . With stock on the farm , the farmers find it necessary to raise a variety of crops for feed purposes , thereby introducing not only a diversity in agriculture , but an abundance of fertilizer for the land . Shrewd observers have noted that it is the community with diversified farming that most successfully weathers hard times in agriculture . AGRICULTURAL LAND. ? Most of the land // in the world can be classified , according to the purpose which it serves , into two main divisions ; namely , agricultural land and building sites . The value of agricultural land depends upon its fertility and its location . There is a wide range of difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so unproductive that the costs of the produce are almost as great as the selling price ; this constitutes the marginal land which will be discussed elsewhere in this book . Much land , however , is more fertile than this marginal land , and produces a large quantity of produce at a lower cost . Again , location is a highly important factor in determining the value of agricultural land . If the land is near a market , its value is increased . An example of the combination of these two qualities , fertility and location , is found in the market gardens which lie close to large cities . The soil is maintained at a high degree of fertility by the use of artificial fertilizers , and the produce , which is very often highly perishable , is shipped to the city market without loss of time in transmission . BUILDING SITES. ? The value of land to be used as building sites depends upon location . The more concentrated the population , the greater is the increase in the values of urban building sites . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate values . Factory production , the development of transportation facilities , and the localization of labor and capital in certain centers have brought about great increases in land values . OrigiSTANDARD // nally , one location as a building site was better than another as a result of natural causes , such as climate , harbors , rivers , elevation , and the proximity to productive soils or mines . But at the present time artificial or human causes are increasingly instrumental in raising real estate values . The erection of each factory , or apartment house , or department store , invites others of like kind to locate close at hand . The old adage , birds of a feather flock together , applies especially to industry , and this flocking together influences the values of building sites t o a great extent . THE LAW OF DIMINISHING RETURNS IN AGRICULTURE. ? As increasing amounts of capital and labor are applied to any given piece of land , there will come a time when the return per unit of capital and labor will not be as great as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t hroughout the world and is chiefly due to the limitations of the mechanical and chemical properties of the soil . The law does not mean that increasing amounts of capital and labor spent upon land must necessarily yield a smaller total of produce , but it means that the yield will not be in proportion to the capital and labor spent . In the following table it has been supposed that t he only cost of the production of corn was that of labor . When ten laborers were employed , the yield per laborer was 200 bushels . When eleven laborers were employed , the yield per laborer rose to 209 bushels and increasing returns for each , unit of labor // operated . But with the employment of an additional laborer , the total yield was only 2,350 bushels , or a little less than 196 bushels per laborer . The yield for each unit of labor cost was less with the employment of twelve laborers , than with the employment of eleven . Diminishing returns operated with the employment of the twelfth laborer , and continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIMINISHING RETURNS IN EXTENSIVE AGRICULTURE. ? The law of diminishing returns holds true , not only for intensive cultivation , but also for extensive cultivation , of agricultural land . The illustration given applies to increases in intensive cultivation , that is , the spending of more units of labor upon the same land . In extensive cultivation , as it is practiced in the western states of this country , diminishing returns will also operate because of the fact that after a time it becomes more difficult to maintain a uniformly low cost of production per bushel as the acreage of a farm is increased . The point of diminishing returns in extensive cultivation changes with localities and with the improvements in the tools of production . The invention of the // tractor plow has undoubtedly increased the profit to be made in large farms in the western plains of the United States , but has not helped the farmers of New England , since the tractor can be used profitably only on farms that are large and level . The causes of diminishing returns in extensive farming are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the shortage of efficient labor , and in the inability to store and market produce to good advantage . It should be noted that the point where diminishing returns begin to operate does not necessarily coincide with the point where a loss is incurred in agricultural production . It usually happens , even after diminishing returns have begun to operate , that the price at which the produce can be sold is high enough to permit production under diminishing returns for some time . As the yield per unit of cost grows less and less , the time will come when the cost of an additional unit of produce will be equal to the amount that can be realized by its sale . Beyond this the wise farmer will not go . CHAPTER III Production ? Labor ABOR , in economics , is that exertion , physical or mental , which is put forth in the hope of an economic reward . This definition of labor would exclude the physical efforts of one who plays baseball for pleasure or for exercise , but would include the exertions of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made by such efforts . The distinction depends upon the purpose of the individual putting forth the effort . THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ECONOMIC LABOR. ? Of the four agents of production , labor is the only active agent ; land and capital are inanimate and are acted upon or utilized by man . For this reason , many economists have tried to measure the value of all commodities by the amount of labor spent in producing them . This concept is called the labor theory of value , and will be discussed under the general subject of Value . Another characteristic of economic labor is that those who work are not only producers , but also consumers . The invention of labor-saving machinery is often looked upon by the workingman with antagonism . History has been filled with instances of this opposition even to the extent of the destruction of machines by workers . It can not be denied that such inventions very often displace men , making it difficult for them to obtain new employment . But from the point of view 68 // of the general public and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production are the very basis of greater economic welfare . This distinction between labor and the other agents of production has real social significance ; as labor is both producer and consumer , there arises a close relationship between these two divisions of economic science . Society should produce those things which the largest class of consumers , the laboring class , needs . The laborers should consume those things which are most likely to make them efficient producers . DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LABOR AND COMMODITIES. ? The leaders of the labor unions object very strenuously to the use of the phrase , " labor as a commodity . " There is much to justify this contention . It is frequently pointed out that labor is peculiarly human , and it is a good thing to keep this emphasis very definitely in mind . Certain differences between labor and commodities are evident . First , labor is perishable , meaning that a day lost can never be replaced . Most commodities may be stored and withheld from the market for a considerable time without greatly affecting their value . Prom the standpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storing up labor . " The workingman must work from day to day without interruption . Second , labor can not be separated from its human characteristics . Employers can not disregard the conditions under which men work . Naturally , there is a great opposition to the classification of labor as // a commodity , for such a definition tends to disregard the human factor . It was natural that economists in discussing the supply of general commodities would find an appealing parallel in considering the supply of labor from a scientific , dispassionate point of view . Had human modifications been clearly and definitely developed , much misunderstanding would have been avoided . Table Agriculture , forestry , and animal husbandry include farmers and farm hands , fishermen , lumbermen , poultry raisers , and gardeners . All these occupations have to do with the production of raw materials , elementary utilities . The extraction of minerals includes owners , managers , and operatives in coal , copper , gold , silver , lead , and zinc mines , as well as in quarries , oil fields , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industry . *Bureau of the Census , U. S. Department of Commerce . // In the manufacturing and mechanical industries will be found several scores of the leading trades , the most numerous being iron and steel , clothing , lumber , furniture , and building . This broad group converts raw materials into useful products . Transportation refers to those engaged in the railroad , steamship , express , telephone , and telegraph business . These men produce place and time utilities by moving materials and commodities to the market and by furthering communication . The trade group has reference to banking , wholesaling , and retailing . It is interesting to note that there were 1,328,000 retailers , 1,500,000 salesmen , including clerks in stores , 170,000 delivery men , and about 250,000 real estate and insurance agents in this classification . For the greater part this group represents the marketing and merchandising of products . They are known as the middlemen of industry . Public service has reference to the work of firemen , policemen , city , county , and state inspectors , United States Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and property of a country and promote general well-being . Professional service includes the well known professions such as teachers ( 752,000 ) , technical engineers ( 136,000 ) , lawyers ( 122,000 ) , physicians and surgeons ( 144,000 ) , clergymen ( 127,000 ) , trained nurses ( 149,000 ) , and musicians ( 130,000 ) . They interpret the law , maintain health , and educate for greater usefulness . // The most numerous groups in domestic and personal service are servants ( 1,270,000 ) ; barbers , hairdressers , and manicurists ( 216,000 ) ; and laun-dry workers ( 500,000 ) . Domestic and personal ser-vice promotes culture , cleanliness , travel , and edu-cation . The clerical occupations include 175,000 agents , canvassers , and collectors ; 734,000 bookkeepers and accountants ; 1,487,000 clerks ( except clerks in stores ) ; 113,000 messengers ; and 615,000 stenogra-phers and typists . This group represents the great office force of the country , preparing business com-munications , keeping records , and establishing costs of production . SUPPLY OF LABOR. ? The supply of labor within any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of births over deaths ; sec-ond , emigration and immigration . The statistics below show births and deaths in the United States for 1923 covering about two-thirds of the states. * // The birth and death rates of the several countries vary greatly as a result of biological , social , and economic conditions . During the early period of our history , large families were traditional and naturally received social approbation . But behind the tradition of the large family was an economic condition of great importance . For many years the United States had vast areas of unoccupied land , and at the same time the people had a simple but substantial standard of living . In other words , it was relatively easy " to start out in life , " and to enjoy the same or even a better condition of living than had been customary for the parents . With the growth of wealth a much larger population can be supported upon the same standard of living . It may easily happen , however , that people prefer to restrict the birth rate in order that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at our excess of births over deaths for a longer period of time would indicate that the percentage of population increase is declining slowly . Inasmuch as our per capita wealth has rapidly increased , the conclusion is evident that we have bettered our standard of living more rapidly than we have increased our population . The death rate of a country depends upon physical conditions , the intelligence of the people , and the progress of medical science . For many years Hungary had a birth rate of about 40 per thousand while the death rate was over 30 . On the other hand , the above table shows a 1923 United States birth rate of 22.4 per thousand and a death rate of 12.4 . Evi // dently the net gain in population for these two countries would be about the same . Generally speaking , the death rate is heavy where the birth rate is large , and vice versa . This conclusion only emphasizes the significance of the standard of living as a factor in vital statistics . IMMIGRATION. ? Although emigration and immigration do not directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect the population in the countries from , which people come and into which they go . The population of Ireland and certain sections of western Europe in years past has been considerably lessened by emigration . The United States has had a larger immigration than any country in all history . During the past one hundred years it has been estimated that almost 30,000,000 people have come to this country . In 1820 not more than 8,000 came , while during the years immediately preceding Footnote // the World War , immigrants were coming at the rate of about 1,000,000 annually . The foregoing table gives the arrivals , departures , and net increase of aliens from 1913 to 1924. * Immigration has played an important role in American political , social , and economic life . This vast influx of people has helped to settle the West , to develop mining and lumbering , and to operate vast manufacturing plants . As a rule , the immigrants have had a lower standard of living , a higher birth rate and death rate than the native-born families . In certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but more frequently the immigrants have stimulated the Americans to prepare for the skilled trades . It has been said that emigration and immigration in the long run do not decrease or increase population in the countries concerned . This means that emigration only temporarily decreases population , for eventually the birth rate will increase as a result of the migration ; and that immigration only temporarily increases the population of the country to which the immigrants go , for in the long run the influx will decrease the native-born birth rate . To the extent that this is true , a powerful argument has been added to the significance of the standard of living and of economic opportunity as determining factors in population growth . It is not difficult to see that the supply of labor has an important bearing upon the growth of locali-Footnote // ties and of the nation as a whole . We shall soon see that it also affects the organization of industry , the degree of individual specialization , and the nature and amount of capital used . The supply of labor also bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be discussed in a later section . THE MALTHUSIAN THEORY ? A LIMITING FACTOR IN THE SUPPLY OF LABOR. ? The Malthusian Doctrine of Population ( so named after its author , Thomas Robert Malthus , 1766-1834 ) is based upon the idea that population increases in geometrical progression ( 2-4-8-16 ) , while food supplies increase in arithmetical progression ( 2-4-6-8 ) . Malthus did not teach that agricultural produce can not actually be increased in geometrical progression , but that , because of the limitation in the supply of land , population increasing geometrically in much greater proportion will sooner or later bring upon the soil a pressure greater than it can bear . In other words , as population increases , it will be impossible for agricultural produce to increase in such proportion that the per capita supply of food may remain the same . According to Malthus , there are three checks to overpopulation : disease , famine , and moral restraint . By the last-mentioned check , Malthus meant that a man should refrain from marrying until he is earning enough to maintain a wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this check could not be made effective , he concluded that disease and famine were the only checks that would ever operate successfully against // the evils of overpopulation . The fundamental contention of Malthus , that increasing population brings a greater pressure upon the soil , is sound ; but Malthus did not realize , could not have realized , that better methods of agricultural production , the use of machinery and the factory system , would make it possible not only to increase the yield from land , but also to use more advantageously the products of the soil . Nor did Malthus sufficiently realize that with an advancing standard of living the problem of overpopulation carries its own solution . Greater vision for the future not only delays marriages , but reduces the size of the family . This conclusion may not meet with social approval ; nevertheless it remains an effective factor in the supply of labor . Until the beginning of the Great War , most of the advanced countries of the world had been enjoying a very much higher standard of living , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This does not mean that Malthus erred in principle , but that by more efficient methods of production , the world has been able thus far to avoid the evils of overpopulation . THE QUALITY OF LABOR. ? The supply of labor of any nation can not be accurately measured merely by the number of workers ; it must take into account also the efficiency of the different classes of labor . The efficiency of a labor force depends upon physical strength , native ingenuity , general education , manual and technical training , and temperament that responds with cheerfulness and courage to // responsibility and demands . Nations differ in the degree to which the labor supply meets these various requirements for efficiency . The Chinese people have great physical endurance , but little technical training . The East Indian is faithful and willing to work long hours , but is weak physically ; and because of caste restrictions and other reasons , he has received almost no training in the modern methods of production . English labor is well informed , takes an active interest in labor solidarity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most competent labor supply in the world is found in the United States ; this fact is probably attributable to universally compulsory education , to native ingenuity , and to the mobility of the labor force of the country . In so far as every man is , in theory at least , a laborer , one might ask , what are the characteristics of a capable , progressive nation ? The following outline contains the leading requirements of a strong people : Table The physical vigor of the American people has never been questioned . By tradition we are a frontier nation , leading an outdoor life in a country loSTANDARD // cated for the most part in the north temperate zone . It is a fair assumption that immigration as a whole has contributed to the physical vitality of the United States . We have received the youth from other lands , who possessed the courage to break home ties and cast their lot with strangers . In no country of the world is there such a development of athletics . Our low death rate is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American workingman is capable of standing the physical strain of modern high powered production . There are more older people per thousand in western Europe than in the United States . Older men and women tend to remain at home while the younger men move west . Below will be found the age distribution for alien immigrants and for the United States as a whole , in 1920. * Footnote Seventy-one per cent of the people coming to the United States were of the most productive age as compared with 47% of our own population . Only 9.4% of the immigrants were over forty-five years of age as compared with 20.8% for the United States . It is also striking to note that 19% of our immigrants are classified as under sixteen , while 31.8% of our own people are under fifteen years of age . It is evident that the movement of people to the United States is largely made up of Footnote // the unmarried and men who leave their families behind . In recent years an ever increasing number of foreigners have come to this country with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more years . This condition has created both a social and an economic problem of considerable importance . The American native stock is naturally resourceful . The same conditions that have contributed to the physical vitality of our people have been powerful forces in the development of alertness , adaptability , and invention . Equal opportunity for all and the Anglo-Saxon principle of individual competition have done much to endow the people of the United States with initiative and energy . This has been no small consideration in the industrial progress of the country . A survey of the United States would show an average of 500,000 students pursuing work in institutions of higher learning . More than 50,000 are enrolled in economics and business administration . Extension and correspondence courses plus the educational programs of religious , business , civic , and fraternal organizations are so numerous as to leave one amazed at the ambition of our adult population . In 1923 , 23,239,000 pupils were enrolled in the public schools of the nation , involving an expenditure of $1,580,000,000. * It would be conservative to say that from 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized education . Footnote // Immigration figures , since the influx of aliens from southern Europe , Poland , and Russia has been so heavy , are not so reassuring . From 1910 to 1913 , 1,143,000 , or 22% of the aliens admitted to the United States were unable to read or write in any language . However , in 1914 only 1.5% were illiterate ; this shows a remarkable change in the nature and administration of our immigration laws . Illiteracy for the United States as a whole , considering persons ten years of age or over , was 6% of the total population in 1920 . Of a total of 4,900,000 illiterates in that year , 1,700,000 were foreign-born whites and 1,800,000 were negroes . The widespread ambition to study has accomplished more for the economic advancement of the United States than any other factor . We may have been rich in natural resources , but we are infinitely richer in mental ambition . Little wonder that we lead the world in the invention of machinery and in the organization of business . The character of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The disappearance of the frontier and the vast accumulation of wealth have been viewed with alarm by many , but the expansion of education must be depended upon to maintain the progressive stability of our people . As a race we are industrious as well as honest and courageous . The power of the American people to save is very great in the light of our vast productivity . We have a broader margin for saving than any other country , which accounts for our // heavy capital accumulation . At the same time , no nation has gone farther in the expenditures for culture and even luxury than has the United States . It can not be said that we have been thrifty in the use of natural resources , though much of our loss has been offset by economies in production and distribution . It should be kept in mind that much of the waste in the United States is the result of not having done what might have been done at certain points in our economic system . Cooperation is one of the greatest economic forces in modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it difficult at times to secure the proper cooperation . Education and experience are doing a great deal to correct this condition . When industry passed to the machine age , it was assumed by many that the laborer likewise had become a machine ; that the workingman had for the most part become a mere helper to a piece of mechanism ; that the machine had incorporated the brains ; and that the laborer had been relegated to a secondary position . No greater error was ever committed . Modern industrial organization calls for the highest degree of team play and cooperation . The uses of land and capital have been largely standardized , but labor remains as the most variable and elastic of all the factors of production . Whatever is accomplished in a given enterprise , be it a bank , manufacturing plant , or grocery store , depends upon the quality of labor , upon the character , morale , and cooperative spirit of the employees . DIVISION OF LABOR. ? The outstanding // feature of the economic life of the nineteenth century after the Industrial Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labor . Individual division of labor means that each person gives his entire time and effort to the production of one commodity or one part of one commodity . Naturally , each laborer will seek to do that which he is best fitted to do , either by virtue of ability and training or because of the possession of exceptional supplies of raw materials . There are four kinds of division of labor : 1 . Occupational Division of Labor ? When the pioneers first settled in the United States , very little occupational division of labor was practised . Each family built its own cabin , tilled its own fields , and made its own homespun , so that each farm was , more or less , an independent economic unit in itself . It soon appeared that certain individuals of a community were especially skilled in the production of certain commodities . The result was that the members of the community would frequently call upon the individual who was the most skillful along one particular line , such as carpentry , for example , for assistance in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with goods , services , money , or some other commodity . In this way , the carpenter gave more and more time to assisting his neighbors in the making of chairs and tables , and spent less and less in the raising of grain or in the hunting of game for the use of his own family . As the population increased , he specialized still further , until all of his // time was spent in doing the work of a carpenter . Another individual of the community , especially skilled , now gave all of his time to the tanning of leather and to the production of shoes , harness , and other goods . Others , especially trained , took charge of the government , of the schools , and of the church . Occupational division of labor had begun . As division of labor increased more and more , exchange became more general ; each individual who produced one class of commodities met his own requirements by exchanging his surplus for the surplus of others . Exchange is the child of specialization or division of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible . 2 . Technical Division of Labor ? After the Industrial Revolution , division of labor was accompanied by machine production and the factory system . Each factory produced one kind of goods ; but within the factory , a new kind of division of labor was being developed . Instead of each individual producing an entire commodity from start to finish , as was the case in occupational division of labor , we now find that commodity production has been broken up into a number of distinct productive acts , each act being performed by a different individual . For example , in the manufacture of shoes , one workman operates the machine which cuts the leather for the soles ; another cuts the softer leather for the " uppers " ; still another operates the stitching machine which sews the different parts of the uppers together ; another workman is in charge of the punch // or the machine which makes the eyelets , and so on . There is an orderly process of employment throughout the factory , each individual carrying the process of shoe production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3 . Industrial Division of Labor ? More recently , certain factories have been giving their entire attention to the production of one part of the finished commodity . One factory produces nothing but soles ; another produces nothing but uppers . In the cotton industry , certain mills produce yarns ; others weave the yarns into cloth ; the cloth is then taken to another factory where it is dyed ; in certain cases the dyed cloth is sent to still another factory for printing . So industry itself has become specialized , divided , and subdivided . According to Professor Edwin R. A. Seligman , " the manufacture of a fine watch calls for no less than 1,088 different sets of workmen , not including the operation of furnishing the power , each using a different kind of a machine . " 4 . Territorial or Geographical Division of Labor ? Geographical division of labor means that each locality produces the commodity which it can best produce . Such local specialization naturally requires that each locality shall exchange its surplus of production for the products of other localities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division of labor is in practice . Pittsburgh is famous for its steel production . Minneapolis handles enormous quantities of wheat and flour . Meat products have become centralized in Chicago . The boot and // shoe industry has been greatly developed in New England . This subject of geographical specialization has been frequently discussed , because it is the foundation of the free trade policy . Protectionists oppose complete geographical division of labor ; free traders argue , " Let each country produce that which it can best produce . " Free traders favor a few industries highly developed ; whereas protectionists plead for a diversity of industries and the economic independence of each country . GROWTH OF INDUSTRY. ? Closely identified with the division of labor is the evolution of industry . There have been several stages in industrial progress : ( 1 ) The hunting stage when practically all economic endeavor was directed toward obtaining game and fish ; ( 2 ) the pastoral stage , a time when flocks and herds of animals contributed the chief items of wealth and endeavor ; ( 3 ) the agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to individual ownership ; ( 4 ) the manufacturing and commercial stage when the raw materials obtained from hunting , agriculture , and mining were made into innumerable finished products and when the exchange of products began on a fairly large scale ; and ( 5 ) the industrial stage when machinery appeared and the division of labor multiplied production and created the basis for a large volume of foreign trade . It must not be assumed that all the people of a country pass from one of these stages to another at the same time . In the United States today there are // still a few people who live entirely by hunting and fishing , a few nomads who depend upon flocks , many who pursue a primitive agriculture , and numerous craftsmen or hand workers who create products without the use of machinery ; yet our industrial emphasis would be , beyond all doubt , that of the machine age and worldwide commerce . Therefore these stages represent an emphasis and not a complete transition . In such an evolution of industry one sees the accumulation of wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , and the development of a complex political , social , and industrial organization . One might readily interpret these stages as the historical division of labor . ADVANTAGES OF DIVISION OF LABOR . ? Many arguments have been advanced both for and against division of labor ; that it has done much toward the advancement of present-day civilization will scarcely be denied . With judicious policies on the part of the employers which will tend to mitigate the evils of the system , there is no doubt that specialization in industry will continue to advance the social good . Among its advantages are : 1 . Increase in Skill ? Division of labor results in a great increase in skill and efficiency in production . Each laborer , making one commodity or performing one productive act in the manufacture of a commodity , soon develops a high degree of skill because of the constant repetition . 2 . Adapting Ability to Kinds of Work ? In order to obtain the maximum of production from any // given supply of labor , it is necessary that the strength and ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division of labor makes this adaptation possible . The more skillful workman can give his entire time to performing the most difficult parts of production ; the weak and inefficient man can find tasks that are not beyond his strength and ability . Through specialization , the productive power of labor has been greatly increased by the adaptation of strength and ability to the different tasks to be performed . 3 . Saving in Time ? In the modern factory , where the individual uses one machine or one tool all day long , there is a great saving of time . In plants where workmen turn from one task to another , using one tool after another , or pass from one part of the factory to another , much time is necessarily lost . The saving of time effected through division of labor is of immense importance to our industries . 4 . Increase in Inventions ? The laborer , by constantly repeating the same act , soon learns how to perform that act with the least possible effort . Furthermore , the intelligent laborer is often able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy and strength in the performance of his work . A large percentage of the improvements and inventions in any large factory comes from the laborers themselves . 5 . Better Use of Capital ? Capital Invested in plants and factories should be utilized to the fullest capacity . Division of labor has made it possible to // keep each machine in operation most of the time . Without division of labor , this continuous production would be impossible . EVILS OF DIVISION OF LABOR. ? The modern factory system tends to make the laborer a human machine . The deadly monotony of performing the same act over and over weighs upon the spirit of the laborer . After the act is learned , no thought or intelligence is required for its repetition . The individual who operates a machine day after day , performing only a small part of the entire process of production , is not able to experience " the creative impulse in industry . " The shoemaker who makes the entire shoe , the painter who paints a sign , and the cook who makes a loaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . The laborer who merely punches a hole in leather , or in tin , or in steel can not experience this satisfaction . So division of labor has tended to make the individual who runs a machine or pulls a lever a human automaton . Employers who have the well-being of their laborers at heart are doing what they can to eliminate this evil of technical division of labor . Charts , showing the relation of each act to the finished article , are posted in the factory . Rest periods have been introduced at those hours when the monotony is known to be greatest . In some factories , various methods have been used to drive away , if possible , the feeling of weariness and monotony . These efforts , while helpful as far as they go , can not do away entirely with this evil of division of labor . // MOBILITY OF LABOR. ? Two kinds of mobility of labor are generally recognized ? vertical and horizontal . There is also a third division , namely , geographical mobility , which involves both vertical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobility is meant the ability of a laborer to rise from a lower grade of occupation to a higher . Attention has been called to the fact that the efficiency of American laborers is , in part , dependent upon their mobility . In no country in the world do laborers rise from the ranks to such high positions as in the United States . The possibility of such advancement gives to at least a part of the labor supply a spirit of hopefulness and courage that goes far toward increasing efficiency . Sometimes this rise from lower grades of labor to positions of power and influence requires more than one generation ; the son , with the advantage of the training which he receives from his father and in the schools , frequently goes far ahead of the position occupied by the father . 2 . Horizontal Mobility ? Labor should also be able to pass from one kind of employment to another of the same grade ; this is horizontal mobility . The degree to which a labor force is able to pass freely from one kind of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withstand dislocation of industry . Unemployment for a long period of time is almost impossible if the labor supply is able to turn its hand from one kind of employment to another in a short space of time . // 3 . Geographical Mobility ? Both vertical and horizontal mobility have a certain relationship to geographical mobility of labor . Geographical mobility requires that the labor supply be free and able to pass from one market to another . To obtain the maximum power from a given labor supply , it is necessary that the laborers themselves should move from that place where there is an oversupply to other places where there is a scarcity of labor . Geographical mobility of labor increases the probability both of vertical and of horizontal mobility . The limiting factors in geographical mobility are love of home , lack of funds to pay moving expenses , lack of the pioneer spirit to take chances in an unknown locality , and lack of knowledge as to the place where labor is most in demand . CHAPTER IV Production ? Capital THE third factor of production , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and labor are primitive and fundamental forces in economics . Turn a man loose in a land where game , fish , berries , and nuts are abundant and he will live , but his living will be precarious unless he has the vision to create a bow and arrow , a fish net , a spear , or some other means of acquiring game more effectively . Very slowly primitive people fashioned crude tools and weapons in order to make land and nature yield greater results . Such ' intermediate , secondary , derived aids or helpers constitute capital . Labor , brains , and vision have created the many forms of capital which have redeemed men from a state of savagery . Beginning with crude tools and implements , each discovery or invention made primitive people more certain of a livelihood . Thus modern capital , comprising the most elaborate machinery for the generation and application of power for man 's use , had its beginning in the simple life of primitive people . LAND IS NOT CAPITAL. ? Most definitions of capital are so constructed as to exclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered capital . First , it was not produced by man but was a gift of nature . True it is that most land has to be reclaimed from its natural state before 92 // it is properly adapted for agricultural purposes , yet for the most part it remains outside the accomplishments of man . Second , it would not be consistent to consider land as an independent factor of production and then establish a conception of capital which would be broad enough to include it . Third , it is expedient to keep land clearly and distinctly separated from capital , for as we shall later see , the understanding of many economic problems depends upon such an interpretation . ABILITY IS NOT CAPITAL. ? Likewise , nothing but confusion is introduced into the subject matter of economics when knowledge is included in the definition of capital . Sometimes a person speaks of his education as his capital , quite correctly assuming that it is largely the result of his own labor and quite logically insisting that it is a most important contribution to production . But acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efficiency of labor . What is more , a man can not sell his knowledge on the market . He may sell the use or results of his training but not the education itself . Capital is something that can be transferred from one person to another . It is objective and not subjective , a part of one 's possessions and not something that must forever remain a part of the individual himself . CONSUMERS ' GOODS ARE NOT CAPITAL. ? The wealth of the world may be divided into two great classes , consumers ' goods and producers ' goods . The former include food , clothing , dwelling // houses , pleasure automobiles , novels , and everything else which is used directly by the consumer to gratify his wants . Producers ' goods are not used to satisfy wants directly , but to produce more goods . Tools , machines , factory buildings , raw materials , fertilizers for the land , business automobiles , and means of transportation are examples of capital or producers ' goods . It is also well to keep consumers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workingman to produce wealth and are therefore necessary parts of the productive processes ; but as we have seen , not all things that contribute to production are included in the economic conception of capital . Both land and knowledge are necessary parts of wealth creation , but for good reasons have been excluded from the category of producers ' goods . When food and clothing reach the ultimate consumer , they have run the course of the economic system . The same products in the hands of the grocer and the clothier have not yet reached the last stage of the productive cycle . Commodities on the shelves of the retailer are producers ' goods ? capital ; in the home of the workingman they are consumers ' goods . They constitute a part of the business inventory of the merchant who is holding them in order that they may have greater time and place utility . Such commodities are on the margin line between producers ' and consumers ' goods . Just one more stage is necessary before they cease to be capital . // PRIVATELY OWNED DWELLING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opinion as to how private residences should be classified . If food and clothing are to be considered consumers ' goods , then homes should be included . A home is simply a more durable form of the means of subsistance . Pianos and many other home furnishings will last as long as does the house itself . There is no fundamental difference between foodstuffs , pianos , and dwelling houses . They are all consumers ' goods . However , the man who builds homes for rent is in an entirely different position from the home owner . In his case dwellings should be considered capital . No one would hesitate to consider pianos rented out to individuals as a part of the capital of the music dealer . Likewise dwellings rented out to families must be looked upon as a part of the capital of the owner . The business of renting houses is not different fundamentally from loaning money . Some economists have found it helpful to consider rented dwellings as acquisitive capital . After all , " the distinction between capital goods and consumers ' goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing economic system ? the fact that men acquire capital goods in order that they may secure a money income . " * ROUNDABOUT METHODS OF PRODUCTION. ? From the beginning of human existence , production has been roundabout or indirect . The Footnote // savage paused in his struggle to get fish with his hands and made a spear which enabled him to multiply his catch many fold . It may be a long step from the spear of the fisherman to the Panama Canal , but the same principle is involved in the one as in the other . Modern industry is becoming more and more roundabout , involving long periods of time and vast expenditures of capital . A lumber company recently acquired thousands of acres of timber in western Washington , laid out a modern city , created port facilities , built railroads , established water lines , and created marketing facilities , as a preliminary step in lumber production . When the land has been cleared , it will be cut up into ranches for agricultural purposes . It may be said that the longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a country increases its capital and progresses from a simple to a complex industrial order , the more difficult does it become for the individual with small means to create such a business unit as will be able to compete in the production of goods . This is but another way of saying that roundabout or indirect methods of production and distribution have progressed so far as to handicap the more immediate and direct processes . CLASSIFICATION OF CAPITAL. ? Capital may be classified as follows : 1 . All permanent improvements on land , such as drainage and irrigation systems , and fertilizers , dams , fences , railroads , highways , canals , and harbors , are capital . In the course of time both fertiliSTANDARD // zers and drainage systems become merged with the land itself . 2 . Buildings including warehouses , factories , stores , banks , power houses , and barns . 3 . Tools , professional equipment , machinery , trucks , wagons , boats , cars , and locomotives . 4 . Horses , cattle , sheep , swine , and poultry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in stores . 6 . Raw materials at mines , in forests , and on farms , as well as auxiliary materials of production such as coal , wood , and lubricating oils . 7 . Money , weights , and measures . WEALTH , CAPITAL , AND MONEY . ? Very few people are able to distinguish clearly wealth , capital , and money . Wealth from the economic point of view consists of all those things that satisfy wants , provided that they be obtained only by some sacrifice . This excludes a broad list of free goods such as air and sunshine . Wealth is the most inclusive of all economic terms . Capital is but a part of wealth ? that part which is produced by man and set aside for future production . Land and food and clothing in the hands of the ultimate consumer are wealth but not capital . In other words , all capital is wealth , but not all wealth is capital . Russia has vast stores of wealth but little capital . Metallic money is but a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also wealth . Although money is capiital it must not be assumed that a nation can become either wealthy or rich in capital by printing vast // quantities of paper currency . Evidently not all forms of money can be included as either wealth or capital . This will be better understood after a discussion of the nature and purposes of money . The following table gives the total wealth , capital , and money in the United States in 1924 . The total wealth and capital are approximated , while the money is for May 1 , 1924. * Wealth Capital Money $395,000,000,000 $125,000,000,000 $8,776,575,139 Two practical conclusions can be drawn from the classification of capital and from our wealth statistics . First , if a capitalist is an individual who owns capital , then farmers , manufacturers , merchants , and most laboring men are capitalists . Second , if all the wealth of the United States were divided equally , there would not be more than $3,424 per person . The quantity of capital per individual would be about $1,124 , while the amount of money per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divide " as sometimes advocated by the radical would not result in large individual portions . SOCIAL CAPITAL .  --  A considerable amount of capital is owned by the people as a whole , through the agency of city , state , and Federal governments . A vast system of public schools , playgrounds , hospitals , libraries , museums , and art galleries must be counted a part of the nation 's capital . In the cities are found municipal railways , water systems , gas and electric plants , and telephone systems which must be included in the classification of producers ' Footnote // goods . It is also necessary to consider government administrative buildings , law courts , jails , forts , warships , and their necessary equipment as part of the capital fund . Protection and research facilities are a necessary part of production , and the buildings and apparatus necessary to make them effective are capital . The equipment of the Weather Bureau at Washington , D. C. , as well as of the Department of Commerce and other branches of government economic service , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business organization should establish a school for its employees or a research laboratory , no one would question an inventory which included both as part of the capital resources . Ownership by the government does not change the nature of these agencies of production . THE SOURCE OF CAPITAL. ? Capital comes from the savings of people . It is only when individuals have a surplus of production over consumption that there is a possibility of capital accumulation . When the primitive man put aside some of his game or fish , he made it possible either to do nothing the next day or to spend the time making some aid for future production . In this manner boats and other forms of capital were made possible . The creation of capital was the result of looking ahead and appreciating the help that a tool would render . This larger vision was the first step in capital formation . The second step consisted in abstaining from some present satisfaction in order to obtain a greater satisfaction in the future . The third step         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
