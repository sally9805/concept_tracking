The author of the following article has for more than ten years conducted a personal inquiry department in one of the most widely circulated metropolitan newspapers . Perhaps no one in America has been the recipient of so many intimate confessions and appeals or has reviewed u more bewildering array of human tragedies . She has been the recipient of hundreds of thousands of letters , and her pseudonym , if it were given here , would he recognized by renders everywhere . WE who sit behind our desks in newspaper , magazine , or syndicate offices reading the thousands of appeals which come to us , and generally to us as courts of last resort , can succeed in our work only in terms of an honest interest in humanity and its problems , a sturdy pride in the confidence shown in us , and an humble desire to meet our opportunity and obligation wisely and well . Ours is all informal social service work . Because we are not officials demanding confidence , it is given us the more freely ; because we offer suggestions rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ; because we are hidden behind the modern smoke screens of large organizations , confession to us becomes impersonal and so practically uninhibited . The thing with which we are occupied and preoccupied is the opportunity for serving those who are too close to their problems to gain a perspective on them . The underlying thought which defies us to be anything less than humble and honest is , " There but for the grace of God , go I. " So for ten years I have been trying to make constructive suggestions to the heart-sick , the brain-fagged and the ghost-ridden who have laid their problems before me with the touching and sometimes terrifying assertion , " I 'll do whatever you say . " The average day 's mail brings one hundred letters , but the number has mounted to eight hundred . Twenty per cent of my letters cry out desperately against loneliness , the " weltschmerz " from which most of us suffer ; but no two letters express their longing in precisely the same terms . Almost as great a percentage deals with the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . In one day ten Italian girls may write their protests against the surveillance under which they are kept . They want to go about to dances as Mamie Casey and Rosie Schloss do ; they want to choose their own husbands , not sit at home sewing for dower chests which will go to men whom their fathers or uncles select . In each letter there is an individual protest against old-world custom ; each girl stresses a different phase of the situation . Ten Polish or Lithuanian or German-born mothers may write that same day to cry out against the lack of respect which their boys and girls show their parents and the traditions of their race ; again ten problems , not merely so many statements of the same question . So the first thing I learned to read between the lines of my day 's mail is that humanity is a many-faceted thing . It is individualistic ? and not rubberstamped . Though all the Babbitts in the world wore gray suits and read detective novels and preferred their film heroines with blond curls , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual ; no two of them would make the same statement of the problem of a seventeen-year-old daughter enamored of the chauffeur ; no two of them would raise precisely the same objections to the match or acquiesce on exactly the same terms . Because I so firmly believe in the philosophy implied in Ruskin 's , " If the heart sinks , the boat sinks , " there is one thing I always try to put between the - lines of my reply to those who ask my advice . That is hope . The courage to go on , the hope which inspires that courage , and the intelligent use of Godgiven powers are the best equipment for conquering defeat , so the other thing commanded and demanded by the responsibility of being arbiter of thousands of human problems each year is not advice , decision , nor admonition . It is perspective . That , in short , is the universal , if unconscious , plea of all the letters I read : " Give me a perspective on this problem . ' lie cyclone is whirling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on outside the storm-belt . " But I am getting ahead of my story and on toward the conclusions I have drawn from my survey of human documents . Before we " conclude " it might be a good plan to begin , and to give the letters a chance to speak for themselves . So we must now indulge in a motionpicture cut-hack to account for the recipient of the letters as well as for her days mail . One August day ten years ago when there were no wars or international debts to crowd the front pages , an astute and hard-pressed city editor decided that lie would have to follow a few unimportant-looking leads in the hope that something better than the fillers he was using might be revealed . My assign-ment was to see if there was n't a story back of the drowning of a famous young swimming champion a few days before , in shallow water , and so near land that he might almost have walked in . " Cramp , " said his friends ; his family had said nothing so elaborately and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill half a column , or more if I could manage to get hold of some good photographs . I was given certain instructions , and , armed therewith , I set off for the tenement where Sam C. , the pride of his district , had lived with his mother , father and two younger sisters . I climbed four flights of stairs to the C. flat at an hour when the father and sisters would undoubtedly be at work . It was the stricken mother , foreign born and dazed by the tragedy , who was most likely to give me the material for a " sobsister story . " When the door opened a reconnoitering crack in answer to my timid knock , I pushed through brazenly and faced a stooped , prematurely old woman in neat print . As her eyes questioned me with dumb hostility , I pulled out the tremolo stops in my voice and cried : " You must be Sam 's mother . I had to see you . I could n't keep away . want to talk about him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I let my voice trail away on the implication that I had cherished an unreciprocated passion for Sam , his mother threw her apron over her head and began to sob . Shame for what I had done might have driven me out of the cluttered little red-plush parlor I had invaded , but I had to stay and comfort the mother I had been sent to lure into the witness chair . And the more gentle and contrite I was , the more I became the outlet for the expression those dry eyes and tight lips had been craving . The mother talked ; she poured out her heart . Sam had been her boy until that girl came to turn him away from his own people . To his mother Sam had brought his medals , his prizes , until that girl came to make him ashamed of his people and their ways . Never would she consent that Sam should marry outside his religion ; never would he do what his mamma said he should n't ; but that girl would n't leave him be ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could n't give her up neither . The mother got out Sam 's pictures , a record of loving pride in her oldest-born from fat baby days to muscular championship ones ; she showed me his new blue serge suit and ox-blood shoes and the straw sailor he had planned to wear next Sunday when he took his mamma and not that girl to the Athletic Club . Now he would never wear it . Dead he was now ; dead to his people he should anyway have been if he married that ? foreigner . The whole story was indicated . Between the lines of the mother 's revelations there was a column at least . I ran lest I read too clearly . Back to my paper I fled to confess that I had seen Mrs. C. , but that I had no photographs , and there was n't a story I could write . The astute editor looked at me out of probing ice-blue eyes and sent me in to the Chief . Into the sanctum went ' my tangled reactions and firm determination to keep faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself clear to the Chief ? clearer than I considered it efficient to be . I tried to gird myself to join the army of the unemployed ; I wondered how I could meet the statement that I owed my first loyalty to my paper ; it seemed almost as if the presses were stopping and waiting with empty maws for the story The Girl Reporter would never write . " The Girl Reporter " went out of print and existence that day , for she was sent to her desk with a sheaf of letters under her arm and the words of the Chief ringing in her dizzy brain . If you are so much interested in human problems that you ca n't see when they arc news , go out and study these letters . They are all that is left of a feature which used to bring in two hundred and fifty letters a week and is down to about thirty now . The department is yours if you can bring it back to a hundred letters a week . You do n't know a story when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent a few of them from happening . " I have tried ! But the front pages continue to blossom in headlines recording suicides , divorces , and murders . Settlemeat workers , however , do not resign their positions or lose faith in humanity because reform schools and prisons continue to hold their sad quotas . They go on striving to reduce the quotas and to find the solvent for some of our social ills . I go on reading my hundred letters a day , and hoping I may be the channel now and then through which faith and hope and new courage will flow into a sad heart . The letters which came to my desk for the first month were a heritage of the " thirty a week . " Trivial , jocose , or even obscene at first , presently they began to yield to an attempt to make the three editorials a week ( which are included in the department ) honest discussions of human interests and not always of Heart-interest . Long , careful analyses instead of two-line snap-judgment answers began to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day there came an amazing document with a self-addressed stamped envelope enclosed for reply . " I 'll bet you put this in the wastebasket before you 've read ten lines , " it said . " I 'm nineteen and I tried to commit suicide , but they yanked me back to the world I wanted to get out of , and here I am working as maid in the house of a woman who thinks she can handle me for the probation officer . But she ca n't . I have red hair and a terrible temper . And I do n't see why I should go on living if I do n't want to . Men are horrible and women no better . My father was an artist of a good family which disowned him for marrying my mother , who was his model and a nobody . He broke my mother 's heart before lie died . But it was not till he was gone that she had me trained as a toe-dancer . She died when I was fourteen , and for five years I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutes and that there is nobody you can believe in . Next time I try to get out of this ugly , foolish world , I 'll make a better job of it . I would n't have bungled this time if the hospital and court had minded their own business . You can write my story if you like . I 'll send you further details if you are foolish enough to be interested . Madge . " Taking my cue from the girl 's letter , I mailed her a ticket to New York , a time-table , and a nonchalant : " Get permission to be at my office as near three as you can make it on Thursday . If that is not your free day , write me what day you can come . " Madge ( which , of course , is n't her name ) appeared at three on Thursday . She said she liked my peremptory note ; she liked my not telling her she was a poor , dear , sweet child , which she knew she was n't . When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had decided to see what I could make of her , she was brought to New York , put under the care of a young nerve specialist , and provided with various jobs , from which she industriously ran away . She always came back to me to report , for she had promised that if ever she determined to depart from the stage of life she would give me due warning , and I had promised that if I could not persuade her to stay , I would n't actively interfere with her going . For twenty-four hours after Madge lost her position in a hospital where the young physician had induced her to go for training , she was a " missing person . " When I came home from the " shop " two evenings later I found Madge on my living-room couch in a little huddle of desperation . " I 'm a failure , " she moaned . " I 'm bringing the most terrible discredit on you . I 've prowled around the Palisades since they fired me . But I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm no good at all . I made chicken broth in the same pot another nurse had used for peppermint tea . And I did n't wash it first . " I could n't even smile , for Madge pointed to the library table and ended with a lethargic : " So I got that out of the bottom of my trunk . You know why . " " That " was a small pearl-handled revolver . I managed to pick it up and examine it with a slightly scornful air . I trumped up a laugh and suggested that I was starved and Lhought it would be a good plan to go out to dinner first and discuss our plans afterward . Madge said I was heartless . But she came along to dinner and , after declaring that no one in her state of mind could touch . food , she ate half a broiled chicken and a few accompanying trifles . Then I explained the girl to herself curtly and concisely : " You have the theatrical temperament . it is high time you used it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stage , earn it , do n't steal it by fake attempts at suicide . I 've gone on believing in you for six months though you have n't taken the trouble to justify me . You 've thrown away every job Dr. R. and I found for you ? not because you could n't make good , but because you did n't want to . Suppose you get yourself a job ! " " All right , " said Madge meekly . Bullying her worked well ; the pearl revolver was disposed of via the janitor ; Madge went quietly to sleep on my living-room couch , and within three days she had a place in the chorus of a new musical comedy . A year later when she was doing a solo bit in a road company , the amazing girl sent me this letter . " I 've jumped the show . The enclosed money I 've saved to repay what you and your friends spent on me . I made up my mind when I could cancel the debt , I 'd say good-by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know I could be as big a fool as my mother was . So I 'm cutting myself off from all who know him -- even you . Do n't worry . You 've bolstered me up to stay if I keep away from him . I 'm going to change my name and get new work . I 'll make good , but you wo n't hear from me again . You acted as if you liked me , but I have too much respect for you to believe you really could care enough for a person like inc to miss her . I 'm doing this not to worry you , so do n't worry . If I got to thinking of quitting again , I 'd play fair and give you a chance to feed me up and argue me down . Thanks for everything . Good-by . Yours sincerely , Madge . " That was all . There never was any more . To this day I am not sure whether the affection Madge scorned would have held her in safe harbor , or whether her fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder ? and hope . As Madge 's story may have indicated , it is no Com ? die 11 umsaine I read , but more often a record of tragedy . It is set down on a scroll of varied pattern and hue . Every day I deal with enough individualities to make up the cast of characters for a Thackeray novel . The college professor and his cook ; the farmer of Saskatchewan and the danceliall girl from Saskatoon ; the cash girl and the president of the corporation which doles out her nine dollars a week ; the captain of a great battleship and the sailor who has n't found a sweetheart in any port ; the light-of-love who lives just off the Avenue and her drab old mother up in the Bronx ; the banker whose wife spends twice his income and the wife of the bank clerk who wo n't give her a tithe of his salary -- all these pass in review in the day 's mail . A strangely assorted caravan winds before the eyes of one it dare acquaint with facts because she is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers try to conceal rather than what they confide which gives the clue to solution . In rationalizing facts , denying them , or protesting too much against them , the whole truth may be revealed ; sometimes the seeker after advice manages to convey by a gesture what she would never put into words . It is not often that I am permitted to read the end of the story I am urged to help write . Generally , just before the final installment , my collaborator disappears from my day 's mail and mental horizon . Sometimes there is a glimpse of coming tragedy that might be avertedif only the right word were said , the right thing done , the right expert ? doctor , lawyer , preacher , or friend ? called in consultation . But when letters are signed , " Constant Reader " and the problem involved can not be discussed in the public prints , there is nothing to do but put a little " box " at the top of my column and say that if " Constant Reader " from Weehawken or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can make a helpful suggestion . Sometimes there is no reply ; sometimes a dozen " Constant Readers " telephone , but they are from Brooklyn or Bronxville and want to know how to take iron rust out of white damask or whether the man precedes the woman down the theater aisle . One day I had twenty frantic pages from a woman who wrote that she was in love with her employer , that he was her mental and spiritual mate as well as the one man in the world for her . She could n't steal him from his wife and children . She could n't go on without him . She gave no address , but the story she outlined showed that she was desperately in need of friendship . She ignored all efforts to reach her . A few days later the front pages carried the story of the double suicide of this girl and her employer in Central Park . At moments like this society , my work , and human nature itself might seem atoms in a whirlpool of futility if life were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cheer . On the very day when I read of the tragedy it seemed my impotence should have managed to avert , along came the first of a series of letters from a girl who wrote happy little accounts of the kindness she observed all about her every day ? of the motorman who lifted a baby out of the street car ; of the policeman who escorted a blind man across the street ; of the lame bootblack who always had a cheery good-morning . These sagas of kindness were always signed " Kid " ( which is the one actual signature employed in this chronicle ) . One day I wow them into an article , hoping the unknown would respond to the implied invitation to become a more definite figure on my horizon . But it was not until over a year had passed that " Kid " came in and told Inc her story . " I was suspected of forging a lot of checks when I was temporarily in charge of the pay roll at our factory , " she told me . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years and had a good record and was only seventeen when it happened , so though they would n't believe me innocent they said they 'd give me a chance and keep me on . I had to work there under a cloud . I could n't tell my mother , for it would have killed her . I could n't tell my father , for he would have gone down and killed the boss . I had to find some way of bearing it , so I decided to look around for some one with worse troubles than mine and try to cheer her up a bit . Then I thought how terrible it must be for you reading about people 's troubles all the time , so I decided I 'd try to lighten the gloom with a few accounts of sunshine . I found it easier to stand my own worries because I thought I might be making things easier for you . And I made up my mind I 'd never come in and bother you with another hard-luck story . I would n't have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessed . " Sherlock Holmes might have failed to deduce the motivating cause behind " Kid 's " letters but even Watson could have read between the lines something of the fine courage and cheer and faith in humanity with which the child made her heroic stand alone against suspicion and lies , and waited , with her head high , for truth to prevail . Many letters are sent to my department merely because it offers an outlet for expression . In similar case a Chopin might write a nocturne . Sometimes such a letter may be sent in the hope of having resolution fortified , sometimes it wants its judgment verified so the other person concerned will see that my correspondent " is not such an idiot after all ! " , often itis impelled by the fairly nor/nal desire to get into print . Whatever the gesture , it has to he ignored , since the avowed purpose of all columns of advice is to help those who need help rather than to give publicity to those who can mint a sorrow into a telling phrase . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the flourish . This is what happened when D. P. wrote that with his wedding day less than a month off lie had been arrested for a crime with which he had no connection . His new home was furnished and waiting when circumstantial evidence crashed down to connect him with an ugly crime committed by a group of wild fellows with whom he had allied himself in the days before he met his sweetheart . " Jane says she thinks I 'm innocent , " he wrote . " But she says that if I 'm found guilty she will break with rue , as her folks would never stand to have her waiting for a man who had been sent up for what I 'm accused of doing , I 'm madly in love with her and she has always seemed devoted to me . I ca n't imagine ever putting another woman into the home Jane and I planned . But if I am acquitted , how ca.n I marry the girl who is ready to desert me if I 'm sentenced ? " A day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't bother about my first letter , " it said . " I was sure of myself within a short time of writing to you . So I sent Jane a letter telling her that I did n't care for her any more , that a girl who would n't stick to a man she thought guilty would n't make much of a hit with me , but that one who would desert a man she considered innocent reminded me too much of the proverb about rats and a sinking ship , Do n't print my letters . I 'd rather our friends thought I jilted Jane than to have them know the trick she played on me . It would queer her for life . " I believe in D. P. The man revealed in his letters is not a criminal . His final protective attitude toward the girl who failed him is that of a thoroughbred ... . I 'm afraid Jane will never let him get away . Most letters , however , do not lift the burden of decision from the shoulders of the figure behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their story as they are willing to acknowledge or are consciously aware of , and then demand clear direction for reaching an imperfectly indicated Ultima Thule . " Do n't tell me to sacrifice my pride , " commands the dignified man who is revolting against the fact that a secondrater has found the chink in the wall of his hitherto impeccable wife 's reserve . What he does not say is , " Find me a miracle whereby I can have both pride and love . Let me go on loving myself too much to risk one atom of my vanity and carefully hoarded emotions . " Turning on life and seeking the ugly cause behind so many of these puzzling effects , one outstanding thing appears to be responsible . It is fear one reads between the lines of so many tear-stained , scribbled , imperfect human documents . It is fear that stalks always behind the longing for a miracle to banish human woe and evoke harmony from discord . Though facts elude expression and words whip moods up the beanstalk of chance and change and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality behind a grim percentage of my letters is that humanity is afraid of the circumstances it has set in motion ; afraid to do something , afraid to do nothing ; afraid to trust to chance , to human nature , to its own view of the situation it has created . Humanity races to the crossroads , and hesitates there , doubtful of its destination , afraid to go west for fear the eastern pa di is the one that leads to happiness ; fearful of going north for fear the southern route would agree better with its health and disposition . When letters are dark with the shadows fear casts it is sometimes impossible to find the road , or finding it , to persuade my correspondent to take the path leading from darkness to the sunshine which may be shining just over the hill . There was a boy who wrote me nine years ago , and who remained " X. Y. Z. " until he became , too late , an unforgettable presence , the symbol of humanity which never knows or cares that only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peaceful blue of a harbor where a frail bark may ride to safety . X. Y. Z. 's first letter told that he was a clerk in a law office and had appropriated a thousand dollars of the firm 's money to his own use and the wooing of an expensive lady , whose opera tickets and caviar-alligator-pear dinners other men were clamoring to furnish . Facing discovery and the consequent gray of prison walls , the boy pleaded for some miracle to make his forty dollars a week meet both the orehidaceous tastes of the siren and the need of restitution . His document revealed far more than its meager words set down . " I ca n't go to prison . I 'd lose Miladi . I 'd die of shame if the folks back home ever found out that I 'm a thief . I ca n't see how to pay back that thousand dollars , but I must . and right away , for the firm is bound to find out that it 's gone . My day of reckoning is near and I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Between the lines of a ten-page letter which repeated over and over again in varying keys what I have transcribed in a paragraph , the boy was revealed as proud , ashamed , longing for some une to tell him he was n't actually a criminal , frightened of life itself , tenacious of his gnawing fox ? a small-town Samson shorn by a city-spewed Delilah . The little " box " in the daily column asked X. Y. Z. to communicate with me at once . He sent a sheet of paper giving a room-number in a cheap hotel and the information that he would call for the next two mornings seeking a letter in his box . " But do n't try to see me . I wo n't face anyone who knows . You ca n't help me by trying to force yourself on me , " he concluded . A letter went off special delivery to X. Y. Z. 's furtive address . I might have broken the law of anonymity which then shrouded my work ; but I was not sufficiently schooled in reading between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law that half-mad boy had set down because he was afraid of everything save what he should most have feared . The letter offered a solution worked out with those who stand ready to make a ' newspaper column a real rod and staff to comfort them whose needs can be materially met . We would pay off his debt to his firm . We would sponsor X. Y. Z. and his future honesty . If he dreaded the moment of revelation to his firm , I would make his confession for him , make it in terms of my faith that he had learned how to walk by stumbling and picking himself up again . He could name his own terms and time for repaying our loan . Hard work and fine things lay ahead and they would fill his life until he found real love ? a star flower , not a dust flower . We were his friends because we too had known loneliness , the difficulty of getting your bearings in a big city , and because we felt sure his fine future was his to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid upon my desk a soggy blue , specialdelivery-stamped envelope with my initials in the corner . It was addressed to X. Y. Z. at his obscure hotel . " Harry ! You did n't ? " I gasped , scenting a hoax which would send the whole city room tintinnabulating . " I was sent for . " said Harry , staring at me somberly . " Bob was my roommate in college , my f rat brother . They got me to identify him and send word to his folks down hi Do n't you hear me ? I got that letter off Bob 's body in the morgue . " With wavering finger I sat tracing my way along the triangle of the envelope 's sealed flap . Harry went on droning out his account of the sister who was coming to take Bob 's body home and what a ghastly business it was fur a fine family . " I had n't seen him for months until I saw him ? like that , " protested Harry . " Guess he was as busy as I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it , brain fag , I mean , or do you know any reason why he should have quit ? " " Did you read my letter ? " I temporized , my heart in my throat as I visualized a possible double spread if Harry were steeped in traditions of loyalty to the news rather than to the " fine family " waiting at home for Bob 's body . " It was sealed when I found it . Could n't bring myself to open a letter Bob had n't read . But why under the sun was he writing to you ? Could n't lie have spilled whatever was on his chest to an old pal ? " " People sometimes write to me for lack of anything better to do , " I contrived . " Sure they do ! There could n't have been anything special on his mind or I 'd have known of it . The heat or overwork must have got him , " said Harry , and went off to find a real story . But I shall always wonder why " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not read that special delivery letter and whether he would have found in it a glimmer of the light he had lost . Perhaps he had read between the lines of fate 's decree that he must give up his expensive lady , and found it easier to give up life itself . Who knows ? For sadly enough there are some who are afraid of everything except death ; they choose the grim solution to the problems of which they are weary ; lacking the quiet courage to fight back an inch at a time from the abyss to which they have stumbled , they find only the flare of energy to rush on into the unknown . Impatience , skepticism , a lack of sustained energy with which to plan a campaign and work it out detail by detail , and effort by effort. , are too often indicated in the letters of those who turn to us of the newspaper columns for the solutions they need to find for themselves if they are to learn how to meet life 's next problem . Like children who BETWEEN THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer to a difficult example in arithmetic , they have not realized that it is only the " answer " they find there ? not the method of solution . So we who take our work seriously , solemnly even , strive to point toward the choice of paths lying before our correspondents , and to indicate where those paths appear to lead . We know that we are not oracles , not even umpires , but merely referees , so we try not to say , " Go here ? or go there . " Our mail would be infinitely less , no doubt , were it not for the jerky , staccato tempo of to-day 's living . Since our correspondents find so little time or inclination for discovering " durable satisfactions " or for quiet , measured thought , there is seldom a note of peace and serenity in any of our letters . Even when doctors , preachers , lawyers , or teachers write ( as often they do ) to suggest that our departments should deal with some problem to which their attention has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When flinging jeremiads at the jazz complex , it is easy to fall under the spell of that blaring , jerky , but altogether insidious tempo . The smooth activity which is life itself , as it goes down dale to plod up hill again , shows now and then in some fragrant letter from one who has found serenity and longs to show others the way . But to leap froni pinnacle to pinnacle or flounder from morass to morass seems to be to-day 's concept of pattern . Nor can my correspondents be classified as apart from the normal social group . Their callings and stations in life are so diversified , their number so great , their difficulties so similar to those which beset the people I meet at work or at play , that in reading the numberless letters of the last ten years , I feel I have been given a chance to study a fairly typical crosssection of life . What those letters reveal may well speak for us all they tell what goes on in the apartment across the hall or the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pang of being alone sets men and women searching for the adventure which so often turns out to be drab and dingy when it is not sordid and cruel . The fear of scornful laughter or of puritanical judgment makes them lie and cheat and steal rather than face an honest accounting . The fear of being unpopular , or bored , or seeming different or dull , the fear of failure , of poverty , of age ? all these minor fears crack the whip and drive humanity into the fear of life itself . Afraid of inhibitions and of the primitive self who might dart forth if the barriers were torn down , is it astonishing that indecision rules the ghost-haunted and that bravado masks as courage ? As revealed in my day 's mail , those we name " our wild young people " are not so brave as they pretend , nor yet so flaming and insurgent as they are called ; rather they are frightened reactionaries impelled by fear of the " chaos and old night " in which they saw the previous generation stumbling about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been unable to lay and a terror of the unknown , transcending the accustomed fear of penalties and shackles . So it cries out to each young Columbus that the world is probably flat after all and that it is mot well to adventure beyond the frontiers of the explored . As long as age and youth do not speak the same tongue , nor see from the same angle , they will doubt each other , and so evoke misunderstanding with all its train of fears . Afraid to seek new standards , to appraise untried values , or to explore our own mental labyrinths , we refuse to discover the truth that would set us free . This lack brings hypocrisy to add to the confusion ; for those who can not bear pain in the hope of growing through enduring , are afraid also to inflict it honestly . So fetishes and lies enmesh bemused humanity . Who fears to look Medusa 's head squarely between the eyes can not see that it is no more terrifying than poor Yorick 's skull . Yet how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelations of my Trag ? clie Hurnaine , I am not worried over humanity ? only concerned ! Ten years ago a brilliant , kindly woman writer said to the Girl Reporter I was then : " Do n't be surprised that so many of the little nine-dollar a week shop girls go wrong . ( Note ? we antedate the Minimum Wage law ! ) Be surprised that so many of them go right . " So perhaps we humans all do surprisingly well ! Whatever of tragedy and hopelessness my day 's mail has been revealing for ten years , it has also revealed so much of love , of gratitude , of generosity , of tenderness , of eager groping , of fine ambition , of fierce yearning to do right , and of glorious power to " come back " from degradation and crime , that the bitterest misanthrope would find himself awed and humble if he could be permitted to read those human documents . The longer I pour over my letters the more I believe in humanity ? its basic honesty , courage , fineness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mist of lies with which we have let our fears veil our potentiality ? our reality . " Our common problem ? yours , mine , everyone 's " has been voiced so simply and completely by Arthur Christopher Benson that I have come to feel almost as if his words are my thoughts made vocal when he says : There is one step of supreme importance from which a man must not shrink , however difficult it may seem to be ; and that is to search and probe the depths of his own soulthat he may find out what it is that he really and deeply and wholeheartedly and instinctively loves and admires and desires . . . There is always a direct and inner revelation from God to every individual soul ; and strange as it may appear , this is not always easy to discern because of the influences , the ideas , the surroundings that have been always at work upon us , molding us , for good or for evil from our earliest days . We have been told that we ought to admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration , our true life , has been clumsily obscured . Because men shrink from the task of probing their own souls , because they even fear it , columns like mine have their place in the house of life . All these " first-aid bureaus " are built on certain simple facts . Folks are folks ; they emerge gently and cloudily from their own generalities ; their revelation is mere background . No social-service worker can afford to be literal-minded ; every social-service worker must be impelled by the love that is the fulfilling of the law . If we of the newspaper columns help in some small degree to discover that " true life " so obscured by living , have we not eluded the fakir heritage of Delphi and worked our way into the social-service class ? So as I try to discover the real man between the lines of my letters , I have come to believe that behind the seven veils of silence and mystery with which we veil ourselves , lies the true humanity , the humanity we must all strive lovingly to free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
