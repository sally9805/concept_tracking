txt Several hundred miles up one of the world 's greatest rivers , the Yangtze-Kiang , lies the important Chinese city of Hankow . It was an early conquest of the Chinese Nationals . There was hope at the time that the movement was really patriotic , with a new and united China as its object . But the Bolshevik from Moscow attached himself to the party with the usual disastrous result . The patriotic movement had generous outside sympathy up to that point , but has now apparently gone on the rocks . Here is a typical piece of Bolshevism which shows that the Communist is incapable of learning , even in the most expensive school , the school of experience . He repeated his own old mistake . lie persuaded the Chinese commander to confiscate all the silver , not only in the banks but in the pockets of the coolies . Any Chinaman possessing even a single ? dollar in silver was severely punished . Following the usual Moscow method , the Cantonese government , improvised by the Nationalists , issued its own paper money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal currency of Chinese interior trade when not conducted by the foreign banks . Unfortunately nobody would take the paper money . just as no one would take the unsecured Russian paper rouble . The Cantonese government is imploring the foreign bankers to come back . The ridiculous Eugene Chen , who seems now to represent nobody but himself . has been dropped . The execution of a few score Communists has completely failed to restore confidence . What little trade was left in Hankow has been killed . The Chinese shops are shut , very little Remains of the stock of rice , practically the only food of the coolie population . All the cord has been burnt . The farmers decline to bring their produce to market because they do not choose to be paid in paper money with nothing behind it . Hankow is a convenient point fur a great river trade . Cargo for export is held up there because there is no real money with which to pay labor to load the vessels . to say nothing of the Chinese crews . Even the ordinary sanitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with n fairly modern lighting system . because there is no silver to pay wages . It need hardly be said that the whole amount of silver confiscated and partly used for paying troops was 210 great matter , although Shanghai estimates vary . It was enough to wreck the credit of the Cantonese government , which is all that mutters . Democracy is committed to the idiotic proposition , not that all men are equal , but that all opinions are equal . Communism goes further and says that one man 's paper money is as good as another 's . In our curlier days , before the Civil War , that idea was by no means uncommon until the national banking system came to the country 's rescue . There is , however , one point of consistency which may be conceded to the Russian Bolshevists in China . Their policy is consistent anarchy . Glasses can be obtained from oculists that will give the face a pleasant expression  --  states an article . Glasses of real beer will do it cheaper .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
