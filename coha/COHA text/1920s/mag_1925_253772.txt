When a crisis is protracted for an indefinite time , it becomes an accepted event without critical moment . In Germany , there has existed a Cabinet crisis for many months ( TIME , Oct. 13 , et seq. ) : but the continuance of this state of affairs has caused the German people to regard it as a perfectly ordinary event . In point of fact , whether or no Chancellor Marx succeeds in forming a <P> Cabinet from the ranks of the present Reichstag is immaterial ; the so-called crisis is bound to continue , for it will be dependent for its existence on the Right and then on the Left as occasion demands . <P> The position is that the Reichstag contains 493 members , 247 of whom would form a bare majority . The Right Block commands only 216 votes ; the Left Block , including the Centre Party , but excluding the Communists , has only 232 votes . A majority Cabinet is therefore impossible unless the Centre Party ( 69 members ) joins the Right , or the German People 's Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither Party will do . <P> President Friedrich Ebert nevertheless requested Chancellor Marx to make a last effort to form a majority Government . The Chancellor tried , failed . The President then asked the Chancellor to form a so-called nonparty Cabinet-a Cabinet of all the parties except the Communists . The Chancellor began to try . It was assumed that the present Cabinet with its four vacancies would be kept in power , but it was not known who would fill the vacancies .
