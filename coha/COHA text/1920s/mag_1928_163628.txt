Four years ago , there was a rumor in Washington to the effect that Mrs. Nicholas Longworth , 42 , was about to have a baby . Experienced newshawks did n't quite know what to do with the story , even if they could verify it which they could n't quite think how to . Several days later a cub on the United Press picked up the rumor from his superiors , and , without thinking much about it , telephoned Mrs. Longworth . <P> " Mrs. Longworth ? Yes , this is the U. P. Is it true you are expecting a baby ? " <P> " Yes , quite true , - in March . " <P> " Thank you . " <P> " Not at all . Goodbye . " <P> In March , the baby was born and with it , thought sophisticated newsreaders , a precedent . They foresaw future front pages headlined with " scoops " in a day when scoops are rare . . . . ASTERBILTS ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD . . . . MOVIE QUEEN WILL BEAR TWINS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEEKS OVERDUE . . . . <P> As usual , the sophisticates were wrong . Since the advent of the daughter of " Princess Alice " Longworth , not a single birth , except royal births , has been forecast in respectable papers , throughout the U. S.* <P> Last week , an expected baby again appeared as a news item . The despatch , sent by the Associated Press wire , was dated from Chicago . Who in Chicago was important enough to have an impending descendant talked about in print ? A McCormick ? A Swift ? A Wrigley ? An Insull ? Whatever may have been their anticipations , none of these were named last week as prospective parents . Perhaps then a politician or a gangster was expecting : was Big Bill Thompson about to be a parent ? Scar-Face Al Capone , had he a blushing hope ? Or was it Len Small who was soon to gain an issue ? <P> It was no politician , but an opera star . Surely there is only one opera star in Chicago sufficiently distinguished to have her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden . Yet it was not Mary Garden , the aged unmarried maiden . The name that appeared was that of a less spectacular but artistically far more competent diva , Rosa Raisa . She , a lady with an equally imposing stage presence , and a far better voice , who refused this winter the leading role in the world premiere of Boito 's long delayed Nerone , and who , at 34 , is listed among the greatest dramatic sopranos in the world , last week left Manhattan on a boat bound for Italy . Ship news reporters watched her sail away , and whatever they may have observed , reported nothing . Three days later , when Mme. Raisa was far away and out of hearing , the A. P. sent out from Chicago its short despatch which contained a compliment usually reserved for royalty . It said : <P> " Rosa Raisa , prima donna of the Chicago Civic Opera Company , and her husband , Giacomo Rimini , who sailed April 13 for their villa near Verona , Italy , are expecting the birth of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The despatch did not reveal the fact that Rosa Raisa would return to America in time to insure her child a U. S. birthplace . <P>
