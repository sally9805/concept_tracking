Just when he was supposed to be looking intently in another direction , President Coolidge turned around last week and said he would spend the summer in the northwest corner of Wisconsin , in a log cabin , in a cedar forest , on an island in a trout stream . <P> Col. Edward W. Starling , official summer White House inspector , had returned to Washington at last with a description that sounded like the land at the end of a rainbow : high altitude , cool nights , few flies , commodious quarters , beautiful trees , abundant game , and trout-500,000 of them , stocked , bred , liver-fed for 30 years - brook trout , lake trout , steelhead trout - yes , even rainbow trout . President Coolidge announced his decision abruptly ; said he would hold the Budget meeting early , on June 11 and leave immediately afterwards for Brule , Wis. , for Cedar Island Lodge and cool woods , seclusion , trout . Summer White House Inspector Starling sped back to Wisconsin to put all in readiness . <P> The place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierce , oilman , business adventurer in Mexico , millionaire . It was tendered to the President by Clay A. Pierce of Manhattan , a son . Clay A. Pierce had never met President Coolidge . The Pierce heirs are anxious to sell the place . The Coolidge occupancy , brought about by onetime ( 1918-27 ) Senator Irvine Luther Lenroot , of Wisconsin , will probably not lower the obtainable price . <P> The late Mr. Pierce fancied troutfishing so keenly that he had the produce of his fish-hatcheries and nurseries graded by size and put into 17 pools or " holes " in the Brule River flowing north through his property . Wire screens which bob up into place again after a boat passes over them , separate the pools . Brush and windfalls are so dense along the river 's banks that fishing is impossible except from a boat . A onetime employe of the late Mr. Pierce says the Brule trout used to be so thick and tame ( from hand-feeding ) that you could take them with only a landing-net . They were so thick that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their artificial diet made them so ravenous that they would strike at anything you dropped overboard-a cigarette butt , a finger . Mr. Pierce was a sportsman and permitted only flyfishing , with barbless hooks . <P> Last week , idle minds tried to discover a political reason for President Coolidge going to Wisconsin this summer . They recalled that at the 1924 G. O. P. convention the delegates from Wisconsin , which that year gave La Follette to the nation , were the only ones who did not join the joyful demonstration at the first mention of Mr. Coolidge 's name . <P> More practical thinkers finished their scrutiny of Cedar Island Lodge 's piscatorial specifications and passed on to other matters . For example , would Mrs. Coolidge find it comfortable ? <P> There are eight bedrooms , four baths , a big circular living room , a study . Oak logs faced with birch bark make the outer walls . Inside are oriental rugs , French wicker furniture , maple piano ( inlaid with gold ) , Italian oak panelling , brass bedsteads . <P> The dining hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rustic footbridge . Small owls and bears , wrought in bronze , light the way . In the dining-room , the furniture is heavy mahogany , carved with a cloverleaf pattern . The 14-foot table seats 30 people .
