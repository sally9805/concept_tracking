txt The text of Charles G. Dawes 's address ' before the : first Expert Committee on Reparations at Its opening cession today was as follows : The difficulties involved in the determination of the allied policy , both in time of war and In time of peace , are little realized by the average citizen in all countries . To him it seems strange that eventual common-sense agreements , which in times of emergency characterize allied policy , come about so slowly . He does not realize the barriers which must first b. , beaten down , erected by national pride and the pride and selfish Interest of different allied officials whose powers are affected by any act of coercive interallied co-ordination . and by the Incessant nik , representations and intolerable interjections of those foul and carrion-loving vultures , the nationalistic demagogues of all countries , who would exploit their pitiful personalities ut of a common misfortune . Let me illustrate : Napoleon 's sixtyfourth maxim of ? war was that nothing in war is more important than a central command under one chief . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war by all the military authorities in the world ; and yet , after nearly four years of warfare and the-unnecessarY loss of tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of millions in material wealth , the German Army on March 21 , 8 , struck at the junction of the British and French armies and broke through because of the lack of a central command controlling the proper disposition of reserves . The British Army was forced back upon Its lines of communication toward the Channel ports . The French Army was forced back upon Its line of communication toward Paris . A gap was opened . Then It was that the Allies , facing the ? abyss , yielded part of their sovereign power for the time being to , the central command under Foch which paved the way to the allied victory . What brought about tile complete allied co-operation in time of war ? Nothing but an overwhelming emergency . And when the . victory came and the Treaty of Versailles was signed , what again have we seen but those same natural forces and immutable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a central allied command in time of war operating to prevent a common allied plan in time of peace ? The Question of Today . What is the question of today ? Upon what does the success of this committee depend ? Upon the powers of persuasion ? Primarily , no . Upon honesty and ability ? Primarily , no . It depends chiefly upon whether in the public mind and conscience of the Allies and of the world there is an adequate conception of the great disaster which faces each ally and Europe unless common sense is crowned king . Does this conception exist ? We do not know , but we shall know . To this knowledge of whether this concePtion exists the results our work and the action of the Reparation Commission thereon will perilafis be the final contribution . As an American citizen , invited to this place by the Reparation Commission , I can speak neither for the Government of the United States nor for the American people ; but as an Individual 1 cair say that I have read in shame and humiliation the outpourings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to lift themselves Into some petty orrice or to maintain political popularity . Surely I have as much right as they Want Only to Be Helpful . tWe come wanting only to be helpful you who with your superior knowlge and longer experience will take the initiative in the search for a comfinon-sense agreement . We come detertained that nothing shall prevent our full Usefulness , if we have any , to Iron in a work which is your the last war I was Chief of Supply and Procurement for the American aaapeditionasy Forces under command of General Pershing . In the vanguard of our army I came with empty hinds . Our great commander Pershing. at the date of our entry Into the ' war , was faced with the necessity of bnilding lines of communications and other installations which would care , for his eventual army . During the first seven months from the ? time we landed in France there were shipped to us from America only 357,000 ship tons of supplies . Yet Wnen the Americans sailed back to the United States the army had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 0 ( 10,000 had been furnished chiefly by France and Great Britain , already stripped of their resources by three years of devastating warfare . When we came we stood emptyhanded , reaching to our friends for the ? needed supplies . You may be stare that we did not start to tell our allies what great men we were aria how much we knew . At their feet humble in opinion . out of their lage experience , we tried to learn the 16:e-ons of the war emergency . Great Britain furnished us ships to transport the bulk of our troops . We fired only French ammunition from French guns . Our artillery was car.ried . into action by French horses . We fle.w . French airplanes at the beginnitt4 Belgian locomotives carried our mate-oafs . Italy furnished us men to work upon our lines of communica-ation -- All our Allies from their depleted l helped us with a generosity to e4hress gratification for which I find noijadequate terms . But there was one supply in which our Government did not fail , and that was in the supply of l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marched and fought With ' your heroic troops in the final great and victorious struggle . With these memories of old associatiOus is it surprising that I feel as if I bftd , corne among friends ? With the conVdence and belief in each other which we had during the war and the kr:re-which has come from past assoclitiiins in common difficulties : with thb , belief that in the providence of C ' ' ' ' ' ' - humanity is facing brighter days , 7avith the prayer that however little as individuals may be our conteibution to better things ? it will be all cc 's ' have  --  let us approach our common wOrk . ' .1 a-Situation as Americans See It . ? ow let us consider for a moment the situation here as it is confronted bY " ' two- American business men who. sOMe three weeks ago , were invited to by ; the Reparation Commission to give detailed attention In connection with the proposed work which we start today . Like the other citizens of our own and other countries , our information consisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from conversatIcrn with others presumably better informed . l'iTe had seen the Allies , finally and really united under a single command . obtain the military victory which we had supposed was the precursor of a butter world . For five years since that time and the signing of the Treaty of Versailles we had seen the ' . AILies losing the unity of understanding ... Which is always-essential to real peace and progress . We had come to ow -- In common with the citizens of nations  --  that at last the lack of rower to agree upon a common attic , , , tude and common action had brought all Europe to a most critical and dangerous situation . This is no time to mince words . What today , at the inception of the work of this committee , have we tound ? In the first place we see an impenetrable and colossal fog bank of economic opinion based upon premises of fact which have changed so rapidly as to make the bulk of them worthless . even if they were in agreement . With all due respect to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labyrinth. they could not have failed to come out in opposite directions . They were confronted with the necessity of finding stable conclusions where no conditions were stable . If in their computations . designed to clarify the mind , they dealt with the mark , the next week the mark was something else : if they dealt with the dollar , the pound . the French or Belgian franc or the Italian lire , there was one value in exchange for each na : : 11 , - +th , , e in internal purchasing power : if they dealt with gold there vat 1 .. pre-war gold and postwar gold to considered . In general we fail to fina much value'in economic arguments based upon what ought to be instead of what is ? based , in other words . upon a constantly changing status quo . Mesniline , while those immense libraries  --  for they can be called by no other name ? of legal arguments , of more or less obsolete statistics and of economic discussion were being laboriously complied for five years , the foundations of economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productivity of Germany . Again , as the world has seen the economic life of Germany ebbing away , the credit of all the European Allies has felt a preliminary shock , because the world realizes that if the German people lose their capacity for work , German loses her capacity to pay those reparations which are so great an element in European solvency . It would seem that that was the situation as it developed . In the minds of your American members of this committee it must have been regarded in much the same way by the Repara- - tion Commission , to whom this committee of pracalcat men , free from political pressure , owes its creation . Realizing that the house was afire , they proposed to find some water to put it out without the further use of mathematics involving the fourth dimension . No Political Questions to Consider . By their instructions they have enabled us to start work on the basis of the status quo . We are not asked to determine legality of the occupation of the Ruhr . We are not asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sense . We are not asked to give our opinion upon those things which the politicians of all countries have interjected into a situation which primarily demands for its proper consideration business minds uninfluenced by political ambition or thought of personal consequences . Upon our report to the Reparation Commission of a plan for the rehabilitation of German currency and the balancing of the German budget it is for them , not us , to be concerned with the political effects . The more I have talked with those here who are nearest the situation the more I have realized the great wisdom the Reparation Commission has shown in defining the purposea of our convocation. " in order to consider , in accordance with the provisions of Article 234 of the Treaty of Versailles , the resources - and capacity of Germany . " We are not " entrusted with considering means of balancing the budgetand measures to be taken to stabilize the currency . If without fear or favor we suggest a plan for the stabilization of the German currency and the balancing of the German budget which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least have done this ? we will have suggested that which has enabled the ' Reparation Commission to start Germany toward productivity , and the re-establishment of German productivity is the starting point of European prosperity . As the economic processes of Germany under a stable currency and with a balanced budget are revived , there will be demonstrated the capacity of Germany to pay . The basic and controlling facts will then appear . Any common sense individual can estimate the distance a well man can run . Fifty medical experts gathered around the bedside of a dying patient will give fifty estimates of how far he can run if he gts well . The Reparation Commission and the world , upon the question of Germany 's capacity to pay , have been listening thus far to ' the medical experts . Let us first help Germany to get well . Now that we are members of a committee having a definite and authoritatively defined object in view , we are less concerned for the moment with the present capacity of Germany to pay than with the present capacity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of deferring plain statement or for this committee to waste time in formalities and meaningless courtesies and conventionalities ? Let us make thus early one practical suggestion . Under President Harding I established a systhm of executive control set up by executive order under which the first budget of the United " States was prepared in accordance with our recent budget legislation . I hesitate to , call myself an expert on budget matters lest 1 put my reputation for ' common sense under suspicion ; but how could any one , expert or non-expert , suggest anything worth while about the German budget if the money collected through taxes and dispersed under the budget would not buy or pay for anything ? The first step which we should take . it seems to me. is to devise a system of stabilizing Germany 's currency so we can get some water td- run through the budget mill . Let us build the mill after we find the stream to turn its wheels . ? to express my individual opinion of the attitude held by the great inarticulate mind and conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . deavor to express it in our actions npop this committee . We come humble in opinion , knowing there is no barrier against acquiring knowledge like pride and preconceived opinion . SVe come knowing that you know much more about your own affairs than we do . We come realizing the a.crifices which you have made for re victory to which our people also o ntributed and of which we share the enef its . i We know that 1.385,000 of the flower of France 's youth , 946,000 Of rtareat Britain 's youth , 460,000 of lY 's youth . 40,000 of Belgium 's south and 127.000 of Serbia 's , youth . together with the precious bodies of ur own American youth . lie burieslose together here , across the sea . re know that from their sacrifice as come a great desire on the part f all peoples to make it worth while or their sakes as well as for those holive and are to live hereafter in the world . ? i              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
