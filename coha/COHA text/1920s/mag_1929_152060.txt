To harass a Cabinet officer by nipping and snapping at his ankles is the legislative pastime of not a few Senators and Congressmen . Such a nipper-snapper is Tennessee 's rubicund Senator McKellar who , at the Senate 's brief special session last month , raised the question of Andrew William Mellon 's eligibility to serve President Hoover as Secretary of the Treasury . Always antagonistic to Secretary Mellon , Senator McKellar , by resolution , asked : <P> 1 ) Could Mr. Mellon continue his Treasury services without the submission of his nomination to the Senate for confirmation ? <P> 2 ) Did his service in that post violate an ancient statute saying : " No . . . Secretary of the Treasury . . . shall directly or indirectly be concerned or interested in the business of trade or commerce or be owner in whole or in part of any sea vessel . . . . " ? <P> Last week the Senate Judiciary Committee set aside the McKellar complaint against President Hoover 's failure to submit Mr. Mellon 's nomination to the Senate , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that appointments did not require reconfirmation . <P> Point No. 2 against Mr. Mellon was as old as his service in the Treasury . Nevertheless , to clear it up once and for all Mr. Mellon sent to the committee , through <P> Pennsylvania 's Senator Reed , a succinct statement of his business affairs , the abandonment of which before 1921 qualified him for his post . Said Mr. Mellon : <P> " Before I took office ... in 1921 . . . I resigned every office I then held in any corporation and resigned all my directorates . ... I sold every share of stock I owned in every national bank , trust company or other banking institution . I then owned and I now own a substantial amount of stock in the Gulf Oil Corp. , the Aluminum Co. of America , Standard Steel Car Co. and other business corporations , but in every case my holding is very much less than a majority of the voting stock of such corporations . . . . My active connection with them was severed in 1921 as completely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Secretary Mellon 's statement so impressed the Judiciary Committee that without formal action it agreed not to question him further . Senator McKellar , however , ' thought he saw a last opportunity for nipper-snapping in the fact that Gulf Oil operates 29 " sea vessels , " that as a stockholder in Gulf Oil Mr. Mellon is an " owner ... in part " of these vessels .
