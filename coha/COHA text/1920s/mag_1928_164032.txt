Whereupon , he issued a proper reply to the twitters : <P> " Insofar as this office is concerned , no restrictions or rules not now in operation are planned for : <P> " 1 ) Canoeing , rowing , sailing , drifting , swimming or sinking . <P> " 2 ) Hours of rising , eating , tooth-brushing , getting to bed , or turning out lights . <P> " 3 ) Types of clothing ( even to the extent of knickers half way to the ankles and red neckties ) . <P> " 4 ) Bridge , checkers , croquet , knitting , or other boisterous sports . <P> " Of course , student ingenuity might devise circumstances under which any or all of these actions might be unwisely combined or misused . <P> " For example , a man in red flannels might try while brushing his teeth to paddle , with a croquet mallet , a canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it became customary , might need very mild and gentle restriction .
