It remained for Brown University to propound the modern application of that ancient pedagogical canon , mens sana in corpore sano . Last week , President W. H. P. Faunce announced that hereafter his undergraduates will be examined not only as to their lungs , hearts , livers and eyes by physicians , but also as to their worries , doubts , despairs , loves and hates by trained psychologists . There will be the physical examination at the gymnasium , the psychological examination in the laboratory . <P> Inverting a famed trade slogan , Dr. Faunce declared : " Hundreds of American students are held back by mental conditions of which their best friends are often unaware . " The appointment of " the best men in the medical profession " was expected to save unbalanced Brown students from the tender mercies of the psychiatrist , from whose diagnoses amateur introspectors have been known to derive harmful results , trying to " live up to their characteristics .
