i AM an Argentine . Not an Argentinian , as you North Americans say , incorrectly , but an Argentine . I have visited your country several times . I profess to know it as well as any intelligent foreigner who is not a permanent resident can know it . But I am not going to tell you what I think of it . Every foreigner does that . I am going to tell you what you think of my country . I am going to tell you that , although your Government and many of your public men have for years been fostering a creed called " Pan-Americanism , " or " Pan-American solidarity , " such a thing is still more of an idea than a fact . Listen to my conversation with George Hopkins Smith , Esq. , a New York lawyer , graduate of Yale ; or maybe it is Bertram A. Jones , of Chicago , box manufacturer , graduate of the University of Michigan ; or Lucas , Robinson , editor of the Minneapolis Blade . " How do you do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are you ? " he remarks when I am introduced to him as recently arrived from Buenos Aires . " Well , " I reply , " I was born in Argentina . " " Yes , I had heard you were a South American . I 've met quite a number of your countrymen lately , and they all spoke English so well , like yourself . I met one from Santiago . Then I met a most charming South American woman . She came from Montevideo , I think  --  wonderfully well dressed . I took her for an American . Really , you South Americans are corners . How are things in South America , anyway ? " " That 's a pretty big question , " I answer . " It 's rather a big continent , you know . I can speak only for my own country . " " Yes , of course . I mean . t to say how are things in Brazil ? " " But I come from Buenos Aires . " " Oh yes , to be sure ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rio that 's the capital of Brazil . I remember now ? Rio is where Hughes went to the exposition they had there to celebrate Brazil 's declaration of independence from Spain a hundred years ago . " " From Spain ? " I exclaim . " Pardon me for correcting you  --  from Portugal . Brazil was settled by the Portuguese , you remember . They speak Portuguese in Brazil . " " They do ? You do n't say ? Yes , I remember now . I was thinking that all you South Americans spoke Spanish . " " No more than all you North Americans speak English , " I remark . " But we do all speak English , except , of course , in the foreign colonies in the big cities . " " Not in Mexico , " I retort . " Mexico ? Mexicans are n't Americans " ( astonished ) . " Not citizens of the United States , but Mexico is in North America and so is Canada . " " But they are three different countries ; quite different . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries in South America quite different . Had you ever thought of that ? " Thereupon I try to persuade George Hopkins Smith , Esq. , to listen to a lecture , or possibly it is Mr. Jones , the manufacturer , or Editor Robinson  --  let it be any one of them . I have had such conversations with dozens of your fellow-countrymen , and occasionally one of them shows enough interest to hear me through . If so , I say to him : " You North Americans  --  you Americans , as you exclusively call yourselves  --  lump the ten nations of South America into one . Argentina , Ecuador , Colombia , Uruguay , Chile , Venezuela , Peru , Paraguay , Brazil , Bolivia  --  they 're all the same to you . Ethnologically , philologically , economically , and even politically you think of them as a unit . You do not grant them national individuality . I have talked with people in all parts of your country , including your government officials at Washington , educated men like yourself . Almost without exception they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' South American . ' They spoke of ' conditions in South America , ' of products and information that came ' from South America ' ; seldom of any special country . It did not occur to them , as in your case , that they were talking to an Argentine , or that Argentina is as different from Venezuela , and Brazil as different from Chile , as the United States is from Australia . " I am a South American , geographically , " I continue , ? " just as Canadians and Mexicans , geographically , are North Americans , but I was born in , owe allegiance to , and fervently love a country called Argentina , la Republica Argentina , . I have respect and what we call in Spanish confra , ternidad for the people of other South American countries , but I do not relish having my nationality obliterated by ? being classed without distinction with Brazilians , Venezuelans , Paraguayans , Peruvians , and Chileans . I know that they feel the same way about it . " Once , when one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mission of friendship to several South American republics , a number of your journalists who accompanied him were tendered a banquet by the journalists of Montevideo . High Uruguayan government officials , the leading editors , and other important personages were present . There was much good oratory , in Spanish , dwelling on the same old ' bonds of friendship that unite the republics of Uruguay and the United States ' of which the guests of honor did not understand a word . One of them , however , had to make a speech in reply , which he did in English while an interpreter translated it into Spanish , sentence by sentence . He , too , expatiated on the bonds of friendship , but not between Uruguay and the United States . No , his theme was the ties that bind the United States and South America . And in concluding he said ' Gentlemen , I lift myglass to South America . ' ' Uruguay , you chump . Drink to Uruguay , ' stage-whispered a resident and wiser North American correspondent who sat at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the proud country in which he was being entertained . " ' What did you make me do that for ? ' he asked afterward . " ' For the same reason , ' said the resident correspondent , ' that , had you been making a speech like this in Paris and had lifted your glass to Europe -- you would n't have done it . Can you imagine what a hit a toast to Europe would make with the French these days ? You know that it would be meaningless . It is just as meaningless here to drink a toast to South America . ' " " But we have only the friendliest feelings for you , Mr. Quintana , " says my victim . " Oh , we do n't doubt that . We in Argentina accept your good intentions and good-will , but what irritates us is your profound ignorance of us , what we are and what we do . Knowing what a great nation you are , we wish your understanding and recognition of our individuality . We read emanations from the Pan-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources , our high civilization , and our bright future , but when I come to visit you and say I am from Buenos Aires , I am taken for a Brazilian or just a ' South American . ' I wonder who reads this literature of the Pan-American Union , anyway . " The most of you picture us as half-breed Indians squatting about the doors of adobe huts , weaving mats , pounding corn in a mortar , and fetching water from the river in clay jugs . You have seen pictures of the half-naked tribes on the Amazon , or the remnant of the Incas in the Andes , and that is your picture of all of us . " " Oh , I am sure you exaggerate , Mr. Quintana . I never quite thought that myself , and I am certain the majority of Americans know you are far beyond that stage . " " Perhaps I do exaggerate , " I interrupt , " perhaps I do ; but let me tell you what a New York newspaper published about the proprietor of an Argentine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . His paper is as successful and as internationally enterprising as that which sent a reporter to interview him . At the conclusion of the article the reporter wrote : ' The South American editor was dressed like any other gentleman . ' " The editor still keeps a clipping of this article as an amusing souvenir of his visit to the United States . ' I suppose , ' he told me , ' that the reporter expected to find me dressed in a belt of palm leaves or , at the best , wearing a poncho . ' " I replied that I should have thought that a great New York newspaper would know better than to publish such a characterization . " ' No , ' laughed the Argentine editor , ' the reporter was a good reporter when he wrote that . It appealed to him and to the newspaper as news and , I found out , it was news to most of its readers that a person from anywhere in South America was dressed like any other gentleman . ' " Some time ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buenos Aires . He had received big popular demonstrations in Rio and in Montevideo , but when he stepped ashore at Buenos Aires the welcoming populace consisted of about fifty Americans , two Argentines who had been educated in the United States , and the longshoremen . No cheering people lined the streets as he drove to his hotel . There was a quiet reception by Argentine government officials at the pier , an escort of grenadiers , but that was all . What was the trouble ? " Unfortunately it chanced to be New Year 's Day , business was closed , and many people were away . Mr. Colby 's loyal attaches were surprised and chagrined , I happen to know , at what they called a frosty reception , but one of the newspaper correspondents with him sensed the reason when he cabled to his paper : ' Secretary Colby made about as much impression upon arriving at Buenos Aires as the Argentine Foreign Minister would make on arriving in New York . It was not due to lack of respect for Mr. Colby or unfriendliness toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheering thousands . ' It was that he was ' lost in the big city , ' a city of nearly 1,800,000 inhabitants , accustomed to the visits , also , of distinguished Europeans . " - " Your story is something of an eye-opener for me , " say the lawyer , the manufacturer , the editor  --  almost all of them who have heard me through . The editor says that about the only thing that has ever made news from any of them is an earthquake or a revolution . The box manufacturer says he has such a good business at home that he does not need to export to South American countries and therefore has no special interest in them . The lawyer says he has always been interested in foreign affairs , but his outlook has been chiefly toward Europe . He always thought it a good idea for the Government to help the young South American republics along and keep the Monroe Doctrine going to protect them . He always supposed that " South Americans " liked the idea and that they were the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pan-American Union ? " I asked him . " Hm -- m , who did start it ? " he reflects and recalls that it was the United States . This lecture does not pretend to mean that we Argentines believe our country to be in every respect as progressive as yours . But we study you . You do not study us . We know your history . What you know of the histories of the respective South American republics can be summed up in three words ? " series of revolutions . " And what you know of them today seems little more than that they compose that vague geographical place , South America , that reminds you on the map of a top or a ham . So I say , if you really want effective Pan-American cooperation , take some interest in us . It is hard for us to cooperate with people who are not interested in us . Teach your children the histories of the South American republics , give them books to study that will tell them what these republics are today . That will bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are necessary .
