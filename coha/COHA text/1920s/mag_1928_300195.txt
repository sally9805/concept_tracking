Because damp wheat makes musty flour , because damp wood makes warped boards , grain and lumber dealers asked Canada 's National Bureau of Research for a quick , cheap way of measuring the moisture of their goods . The Bureau instructed Professor Eli Franklin Burton of Toronto University to work on it ; he put one Arnold Pitt , his graduate student , at the task . Last week their invention was perfected . <P> It is an electrical moisture gauge , which puts to practical use the knowledge that the more moisture a thing contains , the easier electricity can flow through it . <P> Student Pitt measured the conductivity of various samples of grain and lumber . These he then dried in an oven , collecting the vapor in an absorbent material which he weighed before and after the baking . This is the way dealers grade their goods . Thus the researcher obtained figures on moisture content and electrical conductivity . These he correlated into a chart . So much electrical resistance meant so much water . <P> After that it was easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauge , in which grain or lumber might rest . Where it took hours by the oven process to grade material , the Burton-Pitt machine takes ten minutes .
