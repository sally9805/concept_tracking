On Monday the average reached 94.83 , reducing the spread between current level of prices and the record high of 96.25 in 1917 to 1.42 . Bankers - ho have been predicting a big bond market this year now confidently declare it " has come . " Institutions have been buying , dealers have been buying to build up stocks , investors have been buying for investment . Savings banks , perhaps , have been less a factor currently " in the rise than other banks and life insurance companies , due to falling off in deposits in some cases and withdrawals in others to protect margin accounts in the stock market or to buy securities for investment . There has been some switching from Liberty bonds and highest grade securities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the exchange attractive . Other banks and life insurance companies have been heavy buyers of bonds to employ the large volumes of funds in their possession . There has been a marked change in the character of the life insurance business in the last 30 years which has greatly widened the scope of their sales and enlarged their income . The original insurance contract to pay a certain sum to a specified individual or an estate on the demise of the insured has been amplified by other forms of contract ; for example , that , whereby the company will pay fixed sums monthly to a designated legatee for life . All of these have expanded the field appealed to by life insurance . Great growth of group insurance , a relatively recent feature , has at times almost embarrassed companies in the finding of means of investing the huge sums rolling in . In some sections banks have linked up savings accounts with life insurance . EASY MONEY CONDITIONS /EXPECTED All signs point to extremely easy money conditions this year .

Loaning funds on call at 4% or less would not under these cis -- cumstances be satisfactory to the bank . It seems bound to put its funds into sound securities which will yield a higher return . One of the great factors in the money situation is the entire absence of traffic congestion on the railroads . The present efficient transportation methods have made it unnecessary for the manufacturer and merchant to carry large inventories . Thus they are not obliged to lean on the banks for loans to carry large stocks . In fact , many large corporations have been able to loan substantially in the market where a few years ago they were loaded up with materials and borrowing from banks to carry them . That foreign borrowing will draw upon us for limitless amounts of money is less accepted now than it was a year ago . Foreign loans offered in the first quarter of 1926 were decidedly lighter than in the same period of 1925 . Arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' United States is gradually clearing up those problems . Payments of foreign debts of our government were for a time offset by additional foreign loans but these loans are diminishing ; many of them were only temporary . COMPETITION ? FOR FOREIGN LOANS Great Britain , for instance , . reached a settlement with our government nearly two years ago , the gold basis has been restored there , an unofficial ban upon foreign loans by British bankers was raised nearly six months ago so that we have as competitor for foreign loans our greatest rival in finance and industry . Other European nations are now able to furnish at home funds needed by their own people ; some of them are able to lend to other countries . Germany , a heavy borrower here for government , state , municipal and corporation purposes , is steadily impi-oving her financial position so that certain needs are being met by her own bankers while what are regarded as unnecessary borrowings are rigidly suppressed .

Some lines may show increased gains while others may suffer set-be employment at a high level , commodities decreasing in price and a fairly rapid turnoNer of business , the working-man will have savings to bank and owners of business will have surplus profits for investment . When accentuated by funds from abroad in payment for goods , payment of debts and of interest on debts , a steady pressure of money for investment is to be expected . Education of the people of this country in investments is continuing , though much remains to he accomplished . I There is more disposition on the part of individuals to consult their local bankers before purchasing securities ; this with the variety of effort to suppress fake flotations is making the going smoother for the distribution of legitimate securities .

As bankers and bond houses see it , everything points ' to continued and heavy demand for invcstmert securities ; as against purchase of equities . Its backbone is the as- ? surance of low rates for money which can earn more in vested in sound bonds with a daily market than loaned on call . Hence their declaration that " the bond market has arrived . "
