Louisiana has yet to make history by trying a Governor under impeachment . For a month its House of Representatives had labored mightily erecting an impeachment case against redheaded , dimple-cheeked Gov . Huey P. Long . Last week this whole structure fell to the ground when sufficient State Senators banded together to vote for Gov . Long 's acquittal regardless of any evidence against him . <P> Louisiana has 39 State Senators . Twenty-six would be required for an impeachment conviction , 14 for acquittal . Just after the Long trial started last week in the Louisiana Senate , 15 Senators agreed that the proceedings were technically illegal and unconstitutional because the House had impeached Gov . Long at a special session unduly extended . Six of these Long Senators , despite their oath to serve as fair and impartial judges of his case , had sat on platforms from which Gov . Long was haranguing crowds in his own defense . With the opportunity of a full trial on the evidence thus excluded , the remaining 24 Senators flayed their colleagues ' " locked minds " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a special election for his recall . <P> From a mass of sensational allegations ranging from subornation of murder to " friskiness with a woman on a settee " at a New Orleans studio party , the House had reduced its formal charges against Long to eight . These , upon which the Senate never passed , included attempted bribing of legislators , failure to account for State funds , intimidation of the Press , and general incompetency . <P> Gov . Long had contended that the impeachment campaign against him was instigated by the Standard Oil Co. as a reprisal against his demand for a 5 per barrel oil-refining tax to raise funds for state improvements . <P> When the Senate trial was balked , the Governor , in a white linen suit , held a reception in his office beneath the Senate Chamber . Admirers swarmed about , demanded his autograph . He gave it thus : " Huey P. Long , Governor of Louisiana by the grace of the people . "                @ @ @ @ @
