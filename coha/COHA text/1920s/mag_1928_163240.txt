A possible future Empress of Japan was graduated , last week at Washington , D. C. , from the Friends ' School , a stiff Quaker seat of feminine learning . The graduate , pretty , vivacious , and popular among smart Washingtonians , is Miss Setsu Matsudaira , daughter of Japanese Ambassador Tsuneo Matsudaira , and fiancee of Prince Chichibu of Japan , brother of the Sublime Emperor . <P> Since Emperor Hirohito has thus far begotten only princesses ( two ) , the heir presumptive is now Prince Chichibu , second son of the late Emperor , and his fiancee , Miss Matsudaira , may dream without presumption of Empresshood.
