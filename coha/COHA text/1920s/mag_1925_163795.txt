The winter season of entertaining opened at the White House last week with a dinner and musicale for the Vice President and Cabinet . Pink and white chrysanthemums nodded benignly on the assembled guests : Vice President and Mrs. Dawes , all the members of the Cabinet and their ladies ( except Secretary of the Interior and Mrs. Work ) , Director of the Budget and Mrs. Lord , the Assistant Secretary of the Interior , Mr. and Mrs. Henry White , Mr. Richard Washburn Child , Mr. and Mrs. John Hays Hammond , President and Mrs. James R. Angell of Yale , Mr. Frank A. Munsey , Mr. and Mrs. Frank W. Stearns , Mr. and Mrs. Charles H. Sabin , Mrs. Edward B. McLean and others to the number of 50 . After dinner in the East Room , Madame Schumann-Heink and Mischa Elman furnished music . <P> Paul A. McDuffey , six-foot strapping White House policeman , off duty one night when his family was out of town , had a sudden longing for pigs ' feet . In quest of this delicacy he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors , doped , seriously wounded . <P> Six little Armenian girls in Syria spent ten months tying 4,404,247,000 knots depicting an even gross of animals , and completed a rug for Calvin Coolidge 's Christmas . He wrote to the Vice Chairman of the Near East Relief , Dr. John H. Finley : <P> " The beautiful rug woven by the children in the orphanage in the Lebanons has been received . This , their expression of gratitude for what we have been able to do in this country for their aid , is ac- cepted by me as a token of their goodwill to the people of the United States . The rug has a place of honor in the White House , where it will be a daily symbol of good-will on earth . " <P> Upon receipt of the report of his Air Inquiry Board ( see ARMY &; NAVY ) , the President declared : " The President wishes to acknowledge the distinguished public service rendered by the members of the Aircraft Board , which has just completed its report . He believes that the thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who so promptly responded to his call on Sept. 12 . <P> " They dropped their important personal affairs and for nearly three months devoted their talents and energies to a ' study of the best means of developing and applying aircraft in national defense . ' <P> " The report of the Aircraft Board gives to the public a clearer un- derstanding of all the problems involved than any statement hereto- fore issued . " <P> The St. James High school football eleven of Haverhill , Mass. , champion team from New England , appeared at the White House and was shaken by the hands . Then it was photographed with the President-a privilege which has been denied to most White House visiting elevens . Next day it was beaten 13 to 7 by Gonzago High School , champions of the Capital .
