The Chinese Nationalist Government , now firmly and respectably established at Nanking , wants to wipe from U. S. memories the fact that one year ago , when its soldiers took Nanking , they looted much U. S. property and killed one U. S. citizen* ( TIME , April 4 , 1927 ) . <P> Last week the wiping process began in earnest when six diplomatic notes simultaneously changed hands at Shanghai , between Nationalist Foreign Minister Huang-Fu and the U. S. Minister to China , John Van Antwerp MacMurray . Nanking promised in substance that : 1 ) reparation will be made to U. S. citizens who suffered when the city was captured ; 2 ) the Chinese who looted and in one instance murdered will be punished , and , 3 ) hereafter , U. S. citizens will enjoy protection and security in Nanking . <P> In order that the Nanking Government should not " lose face " in China by making these promises , Minister MacMurray assured Nationalist Huang-Fu that the U. S. State Department is " willing to express regret " that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the troublous times . <P> <P> * The Rev. John E. ( " Jack " ) Williams affectionately esteemed by thousands of Chinese who had attended the Nanking University , of which he was vice-chancellor.
