 | AN architect busy is a man who spends all his busy days s putting people 's air castles into terms of bricks and mortar . For some he designs tiny bungalows , with sloping roofs and cozy fireside nooks . For others , pretentious dwellings to dominate great estates . He experiments with the quaint charm of Italian stucco , and the gabled English cottage . He reproduces the quiet simplicity of the New England Colonial type , and the snug comfort of the Dutch Colonial . For men and women ? different in their tastes and in their incomes ? he builds different houses to suit the pictures that have been growing in their minds perhaps for many years . Through all the years of busy planning for others , his own house is taking shape in his mind . Through looking at a hundred types , one type out of all the others comes to be the one which expresses best his character . And that house is sure to be a good one , for it is built by the man who had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to another to express : sometimes they do not understand ; sometimes they understand , but the dream is too expensive and must be put away forever . But the architect begins his dream with an exact knowledge of the dollars and cents involved . Even the fireplace , which is the real soul of a home , has its price tag . And the architact planning for himself has the technical advantage of being able to weave into his design the intimate requirements of his home problem and to perfect them into a complete . and practical working plan without sacrificing the touch of personality essential in the successful home . The problem of building a home is one of ever-increasing complexity . Care must be taken in the selection and use of the site , in the choice of a style of architecture , in the manner of construction , in the type of heating , and many like considerations . But , after all , we must not lose sight of the principal intent of our undertaking , which is to provide in the best possible manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure of the family in its daily home life . Only by so doing can we hope that our house building will result in the creation of a real home . This , then , is the house designed by an architect to be his own home . As such , as the deliberate choice of a man whose business is houses , and whose days are spent in learning to give the best att and the best comfort for the least money , it can not fail to be of the greatest interest to every one who is thinking of building either now or in the future . In these plans the effort has been to meet each requirement of the home in the most direct and practical manner . This has required the subservience of preference in ; unchiteetur , il style and a disregard of certain customary but inessential details of arrangement . The purpose has been , on the one hand , not to stint or economize in either space or cost beyond a reasonable point , while on the other , to see that each and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose to the greatest degree and with the least interference consistent with a well-balanced whole . To the wellknown adage , " A place for everything and everything in its place " is to be added , " A use for everything , otherwise omit it . " The site on which this home is to be located is on a quiet side street in a pleasant suburban community . The frontage is north or slightly northeast , but it could equally as well be east . There is required hut little front yard , that otherwise useless space which is often necessary to shut out the noise and commotion of a more prominent thoroughfare . The arrangement for entrance permits the front lawn to be kept at the level of the public footpath , providing a direct and inviting approach , without steps and terraces , to the entrance door , which is just at the side of the house , giving access directly to the stair hall . The house plan is divided lengthwise into two almost equal parts . One side , or rather segment , is devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk , driveway , and garage ; the other side is given over entirely to the quiet living  | area , which has an outlook along its principal exposure directly upon the garden . A word of explanation is in order with regard to the practical garden . This is not intended to supply the principal table necessities , but is just sufficient for pleasurable exercise during spare moments , without becoming a burdensome care . However , with an intelligent use of fertilizers and cold frame propagation , such a space will supply many fresh , seasonable delicacies so as to become a factor in the daily menu during a considerable part of the year . The garden is treated as a definite and intimate part of the plan . The entire space required for the house , garden , and service yard is 65 ft. front by 85 ft. in depth . However , as is the case in most suburban property , the lot is unnecessarily deep , and it is proposed that the remaining rear yard shall be used jointly with the next neighbor in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required space , 5o x 120 feet . The basement is to be excavated only under the study and stair hall , with just sufficient space for the heater and its attendant fuel supply and waste . The coal is to be contained in a tight , concreteroofed compartment , and the ashes in a sub-floor container . The heater is to be a magazine feed type , automatically controlled . Thus the use of the basement stairs is confined to a twice-a-day attention to the heater . The necessary dust is confined within a virtually sealed chamber . The entire first floor is supported on a concrete underfloor. eliminating all cracks and annoyances due to wood shrinkage . The dining-room is just comfortably large enough for ample service for the table , which is fifty-sir inches in diameter , providing readily for six places . A serving table , near the kitchen entrance , is placed under the window opposite the living-room door , while the inside wall has a builtin buffet with china cabinet above and drawers below . The fourth side is enlarged by a bright bay window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide window shelf for flowering plants . The living-room is a bright , cheerful room , as large as is consistent with the general extent of the plans . French doors afford access to the tiled porch with a trellised roof , the garden lawn being just a step below the floor level . While this porch might readily be glass enclosed , this would require an additional expenditure , both in original cost and in heating cost and care attendant upon a large amount of additional glass . As an offset to the omission of this very popular feature is to be noted the arrangement of the living-room , in which the fireplace is made to occupy the inside wall , permitting the fullest use of the bright , airy part of the room along the outside walls , as well as leaving space for the very ample windows which look out upon the attractive garden , rather than , as is frequently the case , upon the uninteresting side wall of the neighboring house . In addition , the living space is augmented by the study , a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In its location , entering both from the hall and the living-room , this room has a wide variety of uses , especially in a family in which the children have reached an advanced school age . The fireplace is , of course , a practical open hearth for burning wood . Under the case of double bookshelves is provided a cupboard for the current wood supply . The popular fancy for a one-story house or so-called " bungalow " has been fostered partly by the lack of appreciation of good stair design- . Second-floor sleeping rooms have many advantages , especially where the family is moderately large , and this plan is frankly for a home of two floors . This arrangement is not , however , to be confused with the customary house of virtually four stories , where the basement plays an active role in frequent stair climbing , and an attic is depended upon for storage of bedding , winter garments , and supplies . While it is the intention to provide for roof ventilation and attic storage space , accommodations are made in the numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements of current housekeeping . The stairs are designed with a careful proportion of rise and tread and a broad landing just halfway . The plan of the second floor will be found on page 118 . In the upper hall is a large linen closet , with drop front shelves and paneled doors , while the upper part extends back over the adjoining closet , forming ample storage for bedding . Another hall closet is provided for vacuum cleaner , etc . The principal chamber is of just comfortable size for two beds and other furniture , but has generous closet accommodation and a dressing closet with extra lavatory . - - The room on the opposite side of the bath has a large amount of window openings and may be used as a sleeping porch ; the extra closet is for sewing and mending needs . The bathroom closet accommodates a soiled-clothes basket , towels , medicines , etc. - The small front room is a comfortable size for one occupant with an occasional guest . The wardrobe closet may have mirrored doors . The sitting-room is the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket coal grate or gas log if preferred . This is also the guest room , there being provided a bed which is folded into the closet , except when needed . At the time of occupancy by the guest , this closet is available for his use , without disarranging any of the regular family requirements . Only one bathroom is provided , but should a maid be required , a stair can readily be added to the attic by a slight change in the closet space , and here a maid 's room and bath may be arranged . However , the one bath is generous in size , and there is also the extra lavatory in the dressing-closet , which might be arranged as a small bathroom , if desired . But not only are bathrooms expensive in first cost , especially if provided with good fixtures , but also they require much care and attention . With the addition of the conveniently located first-floor toilet , it is felt that ample accommodations have been provided . It remains then to explain the arrangement and use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all this area , including also the front entrance hail and toilet , is to have a floor of composition , which , if proper selection is made , is as pleasant and attractive as the best linoleum and has no cracks . There is also laid with this floor a sanitary coved base , leaving no corners for difficult cleaning and . extend-ing  | into and forming the floors of all cases , below the refrigerator . etc . The plaster walls are also coved at the corners and ceilings , and the usual wood trim of the doors and windows is replaced by a small rounding of metal painted with the walls . It will thus he seen how readily such limited dirt as may accumulate under such a plan can be cleaned . The laundry is shut off by doors but conveniently related to the kitchen and to the laundry yard . Here are provided two tubs and an electric washer , which is drawn out in front of the tubs when in use ( as per dotted lines ) . a gas stove and boiler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combined gas and electric ironer or mangle . A rack suspended at the ceiling with a drop support will accommodate on wet days such clothes as can not otherwise be handled by dry wringing and the mangle . Off the kitchen entry is a large , cool storage doset. with many shelves and bins for supplies . The kitchen arrangement has been suggested by a study of the daily routine . Foremost in these operations is the thrice daily table setting and dish washing . To this end , the china cases , serving table , kitchen table , and dish washer have been conveniently related . The dish washer has its direct connection with the hot water supply and waste pipe and will care for practically all the table dishes . Some housewives are content to leave most of the regular dishes in the washer between meals , otherwise they are stored in the buffet and kitchen cases , according to their destination in resetting the table . The sink is used chiefly for food preparation and kitchen utensils . Adjoining the sink is a deep cupboard above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and access to both the kitchen and dining-room tables , as well as to plumbing @#  | for waste pipe . However , it is anticipated that ice will be replaced by electric refrigeration , in which case a location under the china case , next to the table , might be substituted . The character of the remaining fixtures will depend upon the individual . In the instance of the author 's own use , an electric stove occupies less space than has been shown for the range , so that a kitchen cabinet may also be placed on this wall and the pot closet devoted to other purposes . Provision is also made for a waste burner . which is a great convenience if the additional first cost can be provided . The author 's past experience with practically all the various appliances suggested in this plan leads him to believe that in the first place their operation is comparatively inexpensive , while if they are conveniently installed and intelligently used , it will be possible so to reduce the more irksome tasks of housekeeping routine as to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least provide conditions under which a willing maid need not become a slave to drudgery . It is hoped that this explanation of the rnore practical but necessary side of housekeeping will not leave the reader with an impression that house planning must be entirely devoted to these prosaic details to the exclusion of the more pleasing contemplation of its design and furnishings . The drawings indicate that these complex matters in home planning may receive consideration without jeopardizing the attractiveness of the house .
