How you going to keep ' em <P> Down on the farm After they 've seen Milan ? <P> To answer the above question Prime Minister Benito Mussolini moved last week with cold and drastic vigor . In a circular letter received by each Italian podesta ( mayor ) the Dictator commanded : " Decrowd your city . " <P> Decrowding should be accomplished , continued Signor Mussolini , by deporting back to the countryside peasant families and individuals who have recently moved cityward . The results to be expected from " a vigorous enforcement of decrowding " are , according to Il Duce : 1 ) Rural begetting by deported fathers of more babes than they would beget in cities ; 2 ) Relief of urban unemployment , since those deported will leave behind them many an open job ; 3 ) Creation of a large pool of deported peasant laborers who will toil to achieve Signor Mussolini 's famed program of " internal land reclamation " upon which the State purposes to spend $375,000,000 during the next 14 years . <P> First to quick step after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under his auspices met , next day , a joint conclave of the local Employers ' Association and the Workingmen 's Syndicates-both arch-Fascist organizations . Within 30 minutes they had adopted a resolution in part as follows : <P> " . . . In considering applications for employment in our factories or for membership in our syndicates we shall exclude , without pity or false humanitarianism , all applicants who belong to peasant families . . . . " <P> Second to quick step was the Podesta of Rovigno , small but flourishing Venetian city . His bid for the Dictator 's favor was to install a visa system . Hereafter peasants who may wish to move in from the country to Rovigno must apply for a permit 15 days in advance and have it visaed by the Chief of Police . Implacable , the Podesta announced that such visas " will only be granted in case the residence of the applicant in Rovigno is considered necessary or extremely desirable . " <P> Throughout the week nearly all Italian podestas ordered their police to prepare lists and descriptions of all residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years . Classification and statistification of these lists is expected to reveal precisely what sorts of peasants and how many should be deported . <P> Decrowding by deportation will not begin , announced Il Duce magnanimously , until the expiration of a three months ' period of grace .
