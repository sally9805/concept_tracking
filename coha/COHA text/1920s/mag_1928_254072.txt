Sacred are the relations of host and guest . Recently a trinity of hosts-the City of New York , its Mayor and President Coolidge-entertained Prince Ludovico Spada Varalli Potenziani , the tall , cadaverous Governor of Rome . Last week Guest Potenziani returned to Italy and on landing at Naples spoke as follows of his hosts : <P> " President Coolidge showed me and my staff a cordiality which astonished even the White House servants . . . who are best acquainted with his usual reserve and scantiness of words and gestures . <P> " Like everybody else in the U. S. the President wanted to hear more of Mussolini . . . . <P> " Mayor Walker of New York is a real old friend . . . . <P> " The Italian quarter of New York gives a clear-cut sensation of a transplanted fragment of the mother country . . . . You know the dream of all Italians in America is to return to Italy . . . . <P> " Mussolini 's character and personality carry a strange fascination to Americans . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my opinion that whatever Italy might ask today of American financiers would be conceded without questioning , for Americans like strong peoples . . . . " <P> Observers praised Guest Potenziani for his good taste and restraint in not having asked the fascinated U. S. higher classes to cancel Italy 's War debt to the U. S. , which Congress has already scaled down .
