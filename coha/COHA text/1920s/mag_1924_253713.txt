Operas abound in fights of all kinds , and always have . There is a sword-fight in Tristan , a bullfight in Carmen , a dagger-fight in Cavalleria Rusticana , a gunfight in The Girl of the Golden West , a Chinese axe-fight in L'Oracolo , not to mention word-fights of staggering intensity , especially when a prima-donna screams in Italian and a baritone roars his defy in French . <P> But a real prizefight has not yet been enacted on any American , French , German or Italian lyric stage . Except for a few halfhearted , ineffectual wrestling-passes , no U. S. operagoer has seen even a hint of its possibilities . <P> In England , however , home of rock-bound tradition , the thing has been done , and no less a personage than H. M. Queen Mary , royally prim and sensitive , has vigourously acclaimed the innovation . The prizefight opera was given a private performance last week before representatives of the Court and critics . Enthusiasm was unbounded . Experts marvelled at the way in which the composer handled his difficult subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two contestants were milling gloriously on the stage , while the orchestra milled away at its violins and double-basses , prestissimo furioso . <P> The chorus was divided-a part of it in each of the rivals ' corners . Choral shouts mingled with the principals ' gasps , with the thud of leather on flesh , with the nervous shrieks of the piccolo . The climax arrived with the referee 's musical cry of " Foul ! ! " , which " rent the ear " and which was followed by the trained diapason of hoots and yowls from rival corners . <P> London now awaits with ill-concealed impatience the first public performance of this alluring work . Something of the sort might have been expected ever since Bernard Shaw , in his The Admirable Bashville , put the fortunes of the pugilist on the stage in heroic blank verse . And now it has been suggested that the American composer turn away from Negro , Red Indian and Sunday Supplement subjects , and devote his muse to creating an interpretation of the character and physique of Jeff or John L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may mean that the operatic star ( male ) of tomorrow will go into training with a skipping-rope rather than with deep-breathing exercises . <P> Said The New York World : " In opera it is essential that the tenor shall be either a very young and poor man who gets the girl at last , or else a very wild and rich rake who eventually receives what is known in ring parlance as the raspberry . The American public would not tolerate any of its fistic heroes in the latter unflattering light . And the American public could not conceivably believe in the verisimilitude of the first role . For none in America ever heard of a poor young boxer . "
