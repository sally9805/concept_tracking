txt Harding 's Plea for World Court . It Is a satisfaction to know that public opinion throughout the country is now asserting Itself in behalf of our joining the International World Court . Certainly this consummation Is , greatly to be desired . The Supreme Court of the United States , in carrying out one of Its most important provisions , has allayed the differences and kept the peace between the States of this Union . Why should not a World Supreme Court do the same in keeping the peace between nations ? If you would be Willing just at this time , when the subject is uppermost , to ; give one of the pages of your Sunday Supplement to the reprint of President Harding 's address to the people of this country , written just before his last illness , It would , I think , be received with very great interest by your readers . It will be remembered that President Harding was asked to deliver an address at a public meeting to be held in San Franclsco . Ile accepted , and prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the closing days of his last illness . He was too ill to deliver it , but he asked to have it read aloud for him , and sent It to the press , His death took place a few days later . and this dear and strong expression of his reasons for wishing us to join the World Court may justly be regarded , under the circumstances , as being his dying request to his countrymen .
