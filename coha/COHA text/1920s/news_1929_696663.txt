txt IN the matter of method and re'sults , Al Szmanski , alias Al Simmons , a hitter with a general average of three-seventy-something , is like an artist who paints swell pictures with his elbows . Mr. Szmanskl bats all wrong , with his left foot planted away off somewhere , and any one who ! knows anything about the right way to stand at the plate will state that any one who bats that way just does n't know how to bat : That 's right , I 'm wrong , " Mr. Simmons agrees and goes right along , hitting with his foot in the bucket ! and busting the baseball with vigor and frequency . AI Supplies-One-Third of That Old Pepper , There are three ball players on Connie 's club who furnish most of the vigor and spirit , more commonly known as pepper or the old pepper . The other two are Mickey Cochrane , the catcher , and Jimmy Dykes , the third basetran . ! These three are now the best outfielder , catcher and third baseman , respectively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Minor leagues demonstrating that the wrong way of hitting was right , if successful , before Connie Mack , in the spring of 1924 , allowed himself to be convinced of it .. He has a young brother , Walter , a second baseman in a semi-pro league , who hits the same way , and it seems that this family trait comes down to the boys from the time when their recent ancestors , armed only with Pick handles and Spades , fought off the Cossacks in the streets of Warsaw . The Szminskis had to be ready to run as they swung , which probably accounts for that foot in the bucket stance . Rewrite Men Made It Simmons . Now that Al has overcome the prejudice , I suppose Walter will receive a more cordial hearing when tim day comes for him and he is pledged to some major league firm for a trial . The Szmanskls live ' in Milwaukee , and it was no fault of Al 's that he renounced a Polish name , which is as honorable as any other , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was playing semi-professional ball on the outlying lots around Milwaukee as a boy , the club manager used to phone the box scores of their games to the papers . The lineup of Al 's club was almost entirely composed of names like Szrnanski , Cinkieviscz , Malkeveisez and so forth , and the rewrite men on the receiving end simplified matters to save trouble . You could spend a whole night taking a Polish or Lithuanian lineup over the telephone and still get it wrong . These names accordingly became Simmons , Sink , Malkey , and no forth . " So when the Milwaukee club of the American association nodded to Al and gave him a quick look in the spring of 1922 , ho was Al Simmons to them , At ilrst glimpse lie was Dot much and the Milwaukee club seht him away to Aberdeen of the Dakota league . There seems to have been something pointed about It . I think they were trying to put him in some place where his terrible style of hitting would outrage the feelings of the smallest num. ber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of home runs and doubles and ranged his field like a wild horse , so Milwaukee brought him back for a second look . In his first game he hit a home run and two dou. bles . Harry Davis of the A 's was present , scouting Wid Mathews for Connie Macky acid he wanted to buy Simmons instead . But when Connie heard about Al 's style of hitting he wanted Mathews more than ever . So Al spent most of 1923 in . Shreveport . Milwaukee still did n't believe anything so wrong could be so right , but brought him back in the fall and he got an average of .400 for 27 games . So Connie Mack decided to look him ever , anyway . " o u are playing left field on this club ; now make good for me , " Mr. Mack said when Al showed up at the camp in 1924 . Now , after five years with the A 's , at the age of 26 , Al Simmons Is rated above Babe Rath in general value . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Copyright : 1020 : By The Chicago Tribune .
