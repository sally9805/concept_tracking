AT THE very beginning I wish to admit that this narrative of two independent , income-earning careers in the same family is necessarily one-sided , since the same events are seen differently by different eyes , and this is the statement of only one of the two chief persons concerned . By profession I am a writer and have always done my work at home . My material equipment for earning money consists of a table , a chair , a fountain pen , a stack of copy paper ; and in addition there is the expense of typing what I have written . In twenty years of writing my cost of production has risen only to the extent that all prices have increased ; and were it possible for me to net a million dollars a year it would mean no appreciable increase in my professional overhead . I can not recall the time when I was not an ardent feminist . From my college days America 's foremost leaders in the causes of suffrage and greater freedom for women have been my close personal friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the great city in which we live , and received my portion of the oral and material garbage hurled from the sidewalks at the men 's scanty section . So I believe that I am not approaching this case with any inborn hostility against woman 's right to a place in the sun ? if an independent , money-earning career for the wife can be considered a precious , sun-nurtured spot . At a very early period in our married life my wife launched into a career unconnected with mine . In all fairness to the experiment of separate careers on which my wife and I embarked , I must say at the start that I took upon ourselves as pioneers in a new world of relationship between husband and wife ? with no set traditions , like those of preceding generations , which we merely had to accept and follow . Ours was a venture more like that of Christopher Columbus , setting forth upon an uncharted sea . And Columbus , be it remembered , is to-day honored for discovering something which he did not set out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pioneers he was the luckiest . Notwithstanding my militant attitude toward the right of the wife to her own career , I married with the instinct which the ages have implanted in the male : to be entirely responsible for the support of his wife and any children which may result from the union . But a few years later , when our oldest child , a daughter , was still an infant , my wife developed a craving for an independent career that was almost unrestrainable ? the urge of unformed powers for an outlet ? what outlet she did not know . Financial necessity was not an important element in this vague , resistless urge ; true , I was then still a beginner in my profession , but from the day of our first home there has never been a day when there was not at least one servant in the house ? except for a brief period now and then when a maid walked out and another maid could not be induced to walk into the vacant place . My wife was tireless ? even frantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position to this business or public movement , to that profession ; but without success . The strain of unfulfilled desire was terrific on her , and also on me , since I loved her deeply and felt the impact of her every disappointment . All the tensity of her suffering had its natural overtones of misery in me , since we were then one instrument . Even at this early period I recognized that ours was a problem marriage , and at that time I conceived a solution which was to be my guide for almost twenty years . My wife had to have an outlet for her energies and a gratification of her desire for personal success or our marriage was doomed . I wanted the strain removed from our home , I wanted our marriage to be a success ; so I decided that the only way to secure peace and save our threatened young marriage was for me to help my wife find and build herself a career . " What is it you 'd like most to do , and feel best equipped to do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she cried out in her genuine and desperate suffering . " But I ca n't be happy just as a figure in the home where I 'm using only part of myself . I 've got to be out in the world where things are happening , doing something . " Being a writer , I was not out in this world where things are happening and where I could perceive opportunities and help her to find an opening . So I suggested the thing nearest to my hand and in which my usefulness to her might prove greatest . " Why not take up the career of a writer ? " I proposed . " You have many of the qualities which go to make up an influential and successful writer . I 'll be your tutor and help you out in every other way I can . But you must remember that learning to be a writer , leaving out any gift for it , is just as hard as learning any other profession . " " Just the thing ! " she exclaimed in ecstasy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do the necessary work ! " So we fervently settled down to this first phase of my wife 's career she was going to show me , and the world , that in her was a great writer ! Our daily lessons kept up for a year or more ; then again desperation seized her for its own . It was soon proved that she did not have the patience to endure the drudgery , the routine which are necessary to acquire even passable skill in any profession . She would have the germ of an idea and then was impatient if it did not flower instantly and perfect -- -that was her nature . We abandoned the idea of writing as a career for her and considered many other possibilities . At length , after frantic searchings in our minds and considering what other women were doing , she hit upon an idea . " I 've hit upon it at last , John ! " she greeted me excitedly one evening after I had come in after a long session with an editor . Instinctively she held back her next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to a prosaic drama of every-day living . " What is it ? " I asked . " I 'm going to be an interior decorator , " she cried . " Now what do you think of that ? " " Fine , " I declared heartily . " You have a knowledge of furniture and furnishings and a natural eye for color , arrangement , general effects . With a little practical experience in the business you should be doing mighty well . " Thus my wife entered upon what was at that time one of the newer professions , interior decoration , which has been her career from that . day to this . Here is an interpolation in this narrative which has no bearing on our specific case since we have two children , but which may have some significance upon the general problem of two careers in the same family . Some time ago I cast my eyes backward , upon friends whose marriages had taken place about the same year as our own . Out of those marriages I instinctively singled out fourteen similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had set forth upon an independent career with all her mental and physical functions controlled by the idea of being a success in that career . The one element of those fourteen marriages which gave me pause was : these twenty-eight persons had produced seven children . We are all of that original class which is frequently referred to as the most valuable stock in America ; and yet this little group had fallen seventy-five per cent short of merely reproducing itself . My wife started her career as an interior decorator upon a modest scale , as befitted a beginner . She acted as consultant to people who were creating new homes or were redecorating and refurnishing old ones . Frequently she first created her effects in inexpensive miniature to secure her client 's O.K. before executing the work upon its full scale . And of course she did much work upon approval ? and frequently the approval was not forthcoming . She continued her career upon this basis for three or four years . But soon this method of conducting her business did not satisfy her . The basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw such clients as she desired . It confined her ambition , which had already grown so that it hungered for a larger and more lucrative stage . I knew that she was doing much private thinking upon this subject . " John , " she suddenly burst out to me one evening , in the enthusiastic way which is hers , " I have worked out the best idea yet . " " Yes ? " I inquired . " It is the natural development of the business of a mere interior decorator on a small scale . You know as well as I do that the greater profits of interior decoration come from dealing with the rich , who can afford to pay the highest prices for materials ? on which there is a proportionate commission ? and who can afford to pay fat fees for services rendered . " " Of course I know that . But what 's your new idea ? " Her brilliant new idea was a house , which was also to be the family residence , every detail of whose arrangement , decoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospective clients of what a home should be . She had the name for the house long before she had the house : it was to be called " The Home Beautiful . " I agreed to this new idea , which was to be put into effect at some later time when there was money to launch it . But for a time , because of the lack of capital , the new development had to remain a desired dream . Then I had one of those minor strokes of fortune which occasionally befall an author , and we had the money to turn " The Home Beautiful " into a reality . This experiment of " The Home Beautiful " continued some thirteen years ; and , running somewhat ahead of my testimony , during its final years ? almost up to the day these lines are written ? it was a large English-basement house in the very social center of our great city , where rentals and corresponding expenses are highest . I shall not go into the further development of my wife 's profession except as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Home Beautiful " had my fullest approval and such assistance as I could give it ; for I have already stated that I wanted my wife to be happy in a career . Years before I had conceived this as essential to a happy marriage , and the new enterprise seemed to me to promise her such a career as she had long hungered for . As time passed there were several consequences of " The House Beautiful " which profoundly affected each member of the family . First , there was the matter of finance . To maintain so large a house up to the standard of my wife 's ideal meant a great deal of service ; and to release my wife from the usual domestic and maternal cares of wife and mother so that she would be unencumbered in her profession meant further service . Hitherto in our married life the banking had been in my name , and I had signed the checks for the family bills . But from the beginning of " The Home Beautiful " enterprise it was taken for granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slight personal expense , could conduct my affairs without banking credit ; whereas my wife , besides handling the family accounts , was now a business woman and required credit for the proper conduct of her business . With my hearty approval , a joint bank account was established which gave my wife free checking access to all my earnings . Without going into details not pertinent to this narrative , my wife 's control over the family income slowly grew with the years until at length the control was entirely in her hands . My agent was given orders to deposit directly into my wife 's account all money earned by me and collected in my behalf ; and for the past seven years I have not once been into our bank , and the only money I have had for my personal use has been money turned over to me by my wife . I may add that during all this " Home Beautiful " period my net income , though irregular , has averaged better than that of a United States Senator or a Justice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in modest comfort without added earnings from my wife . I have often gone over the matter of income and family expenses , comparing them , with the husband of my wife 's older sister , who has no separate career and at no time contributes to her family in terms of money . My brother-in-law lives comfortably for a professional man , has sent three children through college , and has laid by a modest competence , which is growing . " John , " he said to me one day with a troubled air , when we had been discussing money , " during all these years yournet income has averaged at least twice my net income . What 's the matter ? " If at that time I saw the answer at least I did not give it to him . With the expansion of my wife 's ambitions and the need of space in which adequately to express and exhibit it , there came a contraction of the house space allotted to me . I had long had a desire for a study apart from my bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my money ? merely a desk and a table ? that we were hardly more than installed in " The Home Beautiful " than I was crowded into my bedroom to do my work ? and for the last thirteen years I have had a bedroom study , just as in the preceding years when such limited quarters were a necessity . The house was my wife 's place of business , the background and stage-setting of her ambition . She had her own private suite in which she lived entirely to herself , a room where she carried samples of materials , a secretary 's room ; and everything else in that great house was subordinated to the requirements of her career . And whenever we entertained she was inevitably the central figure , for this was her house , " The Home Beautiful " of her dream and her production . My wife worked hard ? as hard as two average women whose business it is to maintain a household . Gradually a change came about in our husband-andwife relationship . It is difficult to be exact about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over almost twenty years . But here is one concrete case . For myself I kept the hours most people keep ; but since my wife had few clients during the early part of the day and could do best the concentrated planning for her career late in the night when there were no interruptions from our children , callers , or the telephone , she developed the habit of going to bed late and sleeping late in the morning , having her breakfast served in bed . This made it impossible for us to occupy the same living quarters and meant the gradual elimination of the usual intimacies , sometimes inconsequential but dear , between husband and wife . For about a dozen years my wife occupied her suite on one floor of " The Home Beautiful " and I my bedroom-study on another floor . In the last six years I do not believe I have had six breakfasts with her . The children , as they came along , had their eight o'clock breakfast with me , for they had to be away to school . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides , my wife came to dominate the family finances , she came to dominate all social functions in our house ; for the house was essentially a stage-setting created to emphasize her personality and to create interest in her work . The house was never a home in which wife and husband were equal partners . It was the material expression of my wife 's desire for an independent career . My wife 's great love was the children , and in turn they have always been devoted to her . She gave them her love unstintedly ; she gave the best of her brains in planning for them ; but naturally she could not bestow upon them the personal attention of a mother who has no second profession . I believe that our children , with the still unformulated senses of childhood , were not wholly happy in the management of this large house , where , if they stepped out of their own rooms , they felt they were continually stepping into one of our servants . I shall never forget the remark one of my youngsters made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with some resentment , " wo n't it ever be so that we can he just by ourselves , with no gov-erness ? " Here is a by-product of my wife 's control of finances which has perhaps always been a pettish annoyance . Our children knew that my wife was paying all the bills and they naturally conceived her as the source of all material things which affected their lives . So when they desired a pleasure that required money , or when they needed money for some unexpected school expense , it was to her they went , not to me . It seemed to me that I did not count with my children . These various causes which removed my wife from me , absorbing all her mental and physical energies , and transforming " The Home Beautiful " into a matriarchy , brought about a slow , subtle , almost unconscious change in me . This change brought a great disaster into my own life and into all our lives . With the glorification of my wife and the consequent submergence of myself into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for lack of a more accurate phrase , I shall designate by the popular term " inferiority complex . " My wife had achieved a brilliant artistic success . And although " The Home Beautiful " was not always a business success ? in fact there were many periods of terrific financial strain ? my wife was widely honored because on the purely artistic side of her work she had no superior . Several years ago , when my income was ranging between twenty and thirty thousand dollars a year and the spending of it was almost entirely in my wife 's hands , I mentally surveyed this unusual home in which I had by degrees become so insignificant a figure . I also mentally surveyed the splendid figure of my wife and the career which I had helped build for her . Black gloom enveloped me . My soul kept asking me what all our long struggle was for ? what it was gaining for me as an individual . As between our two careers , my wife 's career was the one which had always been the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become almost solely an element of her personal aggrandizement and an extension of her career . In my bitter thoughts it came to me that after this struggle of years I had no home ; I was merely the occupant of one room in an institution of which my wife was the head . It came to me that I no longer had a wife ; that I was merely living under the same roof with a woman who was primarily the head of her institution , and whose absorption in her career had destroyed the womanly qualities of a wife ; and that she had become a sort of nun gradually adopting the driving and remote qualities of a great abbess . I felt myself a consummate failure . We had money ? lots of money . But there was no money for vacation , for travel , for adventure into beckoning realms of thought and study which did not offer a guaranteed financial return . So much time did my wife spend in juggling with and satisfying pressing accounts for the moment that it seemed to me hardly half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction to this complicated situation , as I now see it , was that of stupidity and weakness . Instead of squarely facing my problem , I turned to the easiest method of escape . I began to drink . Prior to my marriage I had never even tasted alcohol , and during our married life up to this period my drinking had been limited to an occasional cocktail at a dinner party , and this had not caused me to fall out of step with my work for a minute But soon I was drinking regularly , drinking with definite if reckless purpose to make myself forget that 1 had no wife and no home , and to dull the edge of my despair over the sense of the comparative futility of my own career . I sought the soothing stupor and the brief , false importance which alcohol can give to one conscious of defeat . My distressed wife , seeking my cure , took me to many specialists and to several sanitariums. 1 knew what my trouble was : but I did not care ; there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep my wife out of the matter prompted me not to tell this . Among the questions asked me by the specialists was one which was ever-recurring : " What is your home life , what are your personal relations with your wife ? " I lied and said everything was normal and happy . The specialists , not probing deeply enough and finding no other explanation for my sudden turning to alcohol in my middle years , ascribed , with a stupidity equal to my own , my condition to the outcropping of a possible ancient seam in my family , and had me treated as an alcoholic . On one occasion my wife brought an old friend to plead with me , an eminent man in our city , whose eminence is largely based upon his understanding of human beings and the complications in which they become involved . His plea , in the presence of my wife , followed the standard procedure . " John , " the good man earnestly concluded , " you have name and friends . You have an admired and brilliant wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have everything a man needs to make him happy and contented . Why do n't you brace up and make your wife and home happy ? " The devil in me urged me to come back at him with : " You dear jackass , you 're pleading with the wrong person " but I held my tongue , and the next day I went to the second sanitarium . During this period of drinking I worked hard and earned a fair amount of money . But my drinking , my not caring , and the sense of futility caused the loss of many old and valued business contacts . After my return from the last sanitarium to which I was sent , I began drinking again . But shortly after I had a most serious and desperate session with myself . I knew what the basic trouble was , even if the doctors did not . As I saw matters at that time , and as I again reviewed my old problem of maintaining a happy marriage , the only solution to our situation was for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift from my wife all worry of the great financial strain caused by our overhead , thereby re-establishing myself as a figure of some consequence in the family . To achieve this task meant that I must always be at my best , which , in turn , meant that I must cut out alcohol in every form . The same day I reached this decision I went to the doctor who had been my sympathetic and patient friend throughout this period kept my word . In other ways I have been weak or mistaken , but most certainly , I was not an alcohol addict . I worked my hardest and sought to re-establish interrupted business contacts . But I was stale , I lacked the old flair ; what I did I seemed to do through my craftsmanship and sheer effort . But I did regain some old contacts , my situation was turned back toward what it had been a few years before , and my financial returns were adequate to have maintained my family had its scale of living been that of the average family of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had little to do with establishing our standard of living ; and that standard of living was not in keeping with our actual needs and comforts . At about the time when I was making this renewed great effort , my wife had several reverses in her affairs , and her income fell off alarmingly . Incidentally , she never seemed to have a proper understanding of the difference between gross income and net income ? they were apparently the same in her eyes . With our heavy overhead , our financial straits became more acute . My wife lived in economic agony , and under so severe a strain as to make production slow and difficult . " Why do n't you do something to help me ? " she cried out to me again and again . " What more can I do , " was my reply , " when every penny I earn goes into your hands , and when I am earning more now than I could hope to earn if I turned as a beginner to some other profession or to some business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried out to me again and again , " Why do n't you take me out of all this ? " " The only way I can possibly take you out , " was my reply , " is for you and the family to live within my income . " " What , live in a tenement ? Never ! I ca n't run my business from a tenement ! " My net annual income , because of the irregularity of returns natural to my profession , has varied considerably since the far-away days of the launching of " The Home Beautiful " ; but my worst year ( and this came during my drinking periods ) showed a net income of over ten thousand dollars ? so the tenement need not have been an altogether unendurable place . Matters drifted on , my wife always hoping for a turn for the better in our financial affairs . The shell of " The Home Beautiful " was somehow maintained ; there was always a butler , or a finished parlor-maid , to answer the bell and receive my wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets . Under the strain in which we had so long existed romance had been driven out of our lives , and even the placid companionship in marriage , the desire to build up and hold together a family as a unit , had almost disappeared . We spoke many times of a separation , divorce . " Let 's end this hollow show we 're making before the world , " my wife exclaimed , as almost every modern woman has at times exclaimed . " Any day you ask for a divorce I 'll give it to you . " Nevertheless , nothing happened . Matters continued to drift on , growing more strained and complicated . About a year ago my wife undertook a piece of work which required her constant absence from our city for several months . One result of her absence was that my earnings came into my own hands for the first time in many years . Another result was that the bills for the first time in many years were referred to me . I was startled by the current bills of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could upon them , and then A CASE OF TWO CAREERS ? 01 asked my wife 's secretary to prepare for me a complete statement of all indebtedness . I knew in a general way that our affairs were in a sad condition , but I was appalled by the concrete facts of our total indebtedness as expressed in the figures of the statement the secretary laid before me . I did not see how , living as we lived and keeping on living in such a way , we were ever going to stagger through to solvency . With those figures before me , I thought and thought . Finally I came to a conclusion which marked the end of the long years of struggle to secure married happiness by aiding my wife 's separate career . I had to take over control of my own earnings and the method of their disbursement in order to try to protect the future of the children , to lay up something if possible against rainy days and oncoming years . So long had matters been dominated by my wife that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control ? separation followed by divorce . The withdrawal of my earnings from the support of " The Home Beautiful " would automatically be the end of that draining enterprise , and would force us all down to a sound if bitter economic basis . This decision , made in solitary thought , tore at all the fabric of my being ; for I am of the generation that was bred in sentiment and conventional ideas regarding marriage . I wanted counsel and advice upon my decision , and the person I first sought out was the person who knew at first-hand the most about the development of affairs in our family ? my older daughter . I showed her the financial statement my wife 's secretary had prepared and told her that I had decided that the one way out for all of us was separation and divorce . My daughter showed no such distress as I had suffered . She was sorry , but she had a sane balance . She said in her direct , clear-minded fashion , that my proposed decision was the only practical procedure ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she kissed me warmly at the end of our discussion . Incidentally , this experience with my daughter is one more item which makes me believe that the best of the much berated present young generation is far more sane and wholesome in its attitude toward the realities of life than the generation which gave it birth . I moved my few personal belongings out of " The Home Beautiful " and , in as friendly a spirit as the circumstances made possible , wrote my wife that had decided we had been right in our earlier discussions about separation . I asked for a divorce , and I offered to be financially responsible for the maintenance of the children . When I next saw my wife , some three months later , we met as friends , but the meeting took place in the presence of our respective lawyers . She agreed to the proposal of a separation but she was not prepared for divorce . She explained that her profession made her something of a public figure , and divorce might injure her career . Here ends my narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by two earnest people . " The Home Beautiful " is no more ; the family , as a unit , no longer exists ; and my wife , with my best wishes , is now carrying on her career upon a more modest basis . As for me , in many respects I am back where I was before my marriage . I occupy modest bachelor lodgings and , with my wife 's best wishes , I am striving to start my career all over again .
