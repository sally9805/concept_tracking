txt Insanitary Conditions . I should , like to call your attention to the following conditions , asking if such condilions may not be a contributory cause to the prevalence of typhoid fever In this city . A number of the " Women 's Rooms " on the elevated and in the subways , into which I have looked , are filthy . Just to open the doors is revolting , and there are no attendants about . The same conditions exist on sonic of the ferry boats to and from Staten Island . I have seen only one attendant in the " Women 's Rooms " on these boats during the last three months . I saw yesterday in the Lexington Avenue subway , at the Fourteenth Street station , four La - ered ash cans , filled with rubbish and the sweepings of the filthy floors ; a pile of corrugated tin strips and old boards huddled together , resembling the pictures of tenement house conditions of years ago at the beginning of the tuberculosis campaign .
