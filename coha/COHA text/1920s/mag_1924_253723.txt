On Feb. 11 , a citizen of Windsor , Canada , died of hemorrhagic smallpox , so unusual in character that it was not recognized before numerous persons had come in contact with the patient . Cases soon developed in neighboring cities and in the State of Michigan . During the first six months of 1924 , 3,999 cases of smallpox were reported in Michigan , of which 1,532 were in Detroit . From Jan. 1 to May 30 , there were 106 deaths from smallpox in Detroit and 27 in the rest of the State . The Health Officer of the Canadian cities involved issued a report on the relation of vaccination to the outbreak : no person who had been successfully vaccinated at any time in his life died of smallpox ; of those who had never been successfully vaccinated and who developed the disease , 71% died ; no one who had been vaccinated successfully within the previous twelve years developed smallpox ; nurses , whose only protection against the disease was recent vaccination , nursed patients for weeks without contracting smallpox .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
