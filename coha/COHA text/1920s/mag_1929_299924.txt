Will the U. S. musician soon go where the motor is supposed to have sent the horse ? That is the question which President Joseph N. Weber of the American Federation of Musicians was trying to answer at the Federation 's convention in Denver this week . An unemployment crisis , now acute , started in 1926 when Warner Bros. , as licensee of Western Electric Co. , introduced to Manhattan audiences the Vitaphone . In 1927 , Fox Film Corp . gave its first public demonstration of Movietone . Today , approximately 2,000 theatres throughout the land have been wired for sound picture showing . <P> To cinema patrons the " talkies " are only a new form of amusement . But to the American Federation of Musicians they are an unprecedented affliction . Since the introduction of sound films , it is estimated that 35,000 musicians have been thrown out of work . As current contracts expire this number will grow fast . In some places , not even current contracts are saving the musicians . <P> Last week in San Francisco a lawsuit was pending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture theatres which have installed sound equipment to employ members of the musicians ' union , under a contract entered into last year with Allied Amusement Industries . <P> Another typical case is that of the Strand Theatre , Akron . The Strand 's musicians must remain in the pit six hours on Sunday , three hours on week days , although they only play for 15 minutes per day since the installation of a sound apparatus . If they leave , their contract is broken . <P> Local unions determine the number of men to constitute a theatre orchestra according to the size and type of the house . The cost of maintaining even so small an ensemble as 15 men at the average wage of $60 per week is $46,800 a year , exclusive of a conductor . The cost of installing a sound apparatus , according to the latest figures from Radio Corp . of America , is from $13,500 to $15,500 for a house seating 2,500 to 3,500 ; $9.000 for a theatre with a capacity of 750 to 1,250 . Even plus the price of operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Where are the musicians to go ? Three years ago it was practically impossible for a symphony manager to persuade a good man to change his job . Today there are 20 applications for every vacancy . Except for the Boston Symphony , every orchestra is unionized . Each organization employs approximately 100 men . The minimum wage scale runs from $90 weekly ( NewYork Philharmonic-Symphony ) to $60 . The cost of subsidizing a symphony orchestra is staggering . Guarantors must be prepared to spend from $100,000 to $200,000 yearly . Under such circumstances , new symphony orchestras have not been and are unlikely to be springing up . <P> Meanwhile , the average weekly demand for musicians at member-studios of the Association of Motion Picture Producers is from 150 to 175 players . Weekly pay checks for such positions run high , ranging from $350 to $600 . But the average musician out of work is not qualified for the job . Only men of highest calibre are equipped for the delicate work of recording for synchronized sound films . And the cinema studios are already beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> No solution is in sight . Where are 35,000 men , trained to be violinists , saxophonists , drummers , trumpeters , to find work ?
