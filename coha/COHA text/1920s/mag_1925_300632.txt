For many weeks negotiations have been in progress at Paris between the French and German Governments for a new commercial treaty . Since economic conditions in Germany are daily improving , thanks to the Experts ' Plan , and since Germany must import and export if she is to pay the gigantic reparations bill , it would seem to follow that a mutually agreeable trade treaty would be made by the two countries . <P> But the French and the Germans have not been able to agree and , in the opinion of the experts , they are not likely to agree for some time . Their disagreement led to prophesies of a tariff war between the two countries . Le Matin , Paris journal , summed up the situation by stating that " once more the peace of Europe is becoming uncertain . It may be a bloodless war , but economic war is none the less terrible . " <P> It came as a relief to the people on both sides of the Rhine that both Governments agreed , in the event of a final rupture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread tariff war . France made known that her general tariff rates ( for all countries not benefiting by a most favored nation treaty ) would apply to German goods . Germany declared that her single tariff for all countries would be applied to French goods . <P> The trade parley continued .
