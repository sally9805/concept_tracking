At Kritzendorf , small Austrian hamlet , there shuffled off this mortal coil one of the most picturesque characters of an age that is past . Death came to 84-year-old Peter Menth , famed in Vienna and throughout the German Empire as the world 's best maker of boots . <P> He was buried in the local cemetery ( Baron von Auffenberg-Kornarow , onetime Austrian Minister of War , delivered a funeral oration ) in the costume of Hans Sachs , the famed medieval poet-bootmaker whom Wagner immortalized in his Die Meistersinger von Nrnbcrg . During his life , Menth adopted the costume of Sachs and knew by heart the songs and verses of the latter 's collected works ( 20 volumes ) .
