txt One of the most interesting men in London is Sri Bradford Leslie . who was literally a great " builder " ' for the empire . in those Victorian days that were all empire Wilding and interesting conversation nrach as , " says Sir Bradford , you do n't set In the drawing rooms of today ! " One of England 's greatest engineers . he devoted thirty years- of his life to the work of building the Indian railways and their bridges . but he proudly claims that be is " really almost an American . " because his father was . in fact , - American and was rawer naturalized ! His remarkable youth at 93 is only a fitting crown to an absorbing Use . Lord Mayo , one of India 's Viceroys , was for years his closest friend . He knew Charles Dickens Intimately as a young man , and among his acquaintances were Thackeray . Landseer and almost every one of note in the artistic world of the period . It is a. period he has outlived but still has hardly time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engineering world today , attending to his business as Chairman of the Southern Punjab Railway , Inventing new " gadgets " from time to time and interesting himself in the pure food problem . Sir Bradford has at last started to write his reminiscences . His father was the artist C. R. Leslie . many of whose pictures now hang in the National Gallery in London . Every one who was any one was painted by Leslie , and they all came to the artist 's home  --  for pleasure and not business . a young boy still at that time , and I have always been sorry that I did not kn6tv Dickens as well when I was older . But I went away from London in my engineering work , and then he separated from his wife , after their family grew up , and went away in his turn . ' t According to the Leslie family , many of the American incidents in " Martin Chuzzlewit " are actual experiences of Dickens 's own when he traveled to the States about that time . The story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somewhere in the first half of the eighteenth century Sir Bradford 's great-grandfather , a weaver from Fifeshire , emigrated and settled in Maryland . The War of Independence found him prosperous and a stanch republican . Indeed , he devoted his time to the weaving of cloth for American uniforms , and many of his family fought on the " rebel " side . It was intended that his son should also be a weaver , but the boy showed a natural aptitude for mechanic 's work . When he was still young he did-all manner of intricate repairs for thee neighbors and eventually , without any training- but with apparently an instinct for the work , he settled down as a watchmaker . He quickly became the most famous and successful In the countryside , and moved to Philadelphia , where his fame increased and his shop became , a rendezvous for all the notables of the town . It is a proud " tradition of this very democratic family that Benjamin Franklin was a regular habitu and that once George Washington himself visited the shop . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , that is  --  showed a natural bent for drawing , but this was discouraged by his father and his father 's friend , Samuel Bradford ( for whom Sir Bradford was named ) , a publisher , to whom the young artist was eventually apprenticed . C. R. Leslie , however , continued sketching , and one day he made a series of rough drawings of a wellknown actor-named Cooke , then playing In Philadelphia- The likeness was so striking that when he showed the picture to his master the latter became convinced at last that the young mail should be allowed to take up art : Sent to London to Study . He carried the portrait to his friends on the Stock Exchange for their opinion . and all were so well agreed ' upon its merits that they took up , then and there , a collection to pay for the young artist 's training in London ? , Slamuel Bradford being a particularly generous contributor . Leslie went to London , and , with the exception , of several brief visits to his own country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , says Sir Bradford . was particularly delighted whenever he received notice of jury service or voting to return the official papers marked " U. S. Citizen . " But the story does not end there . Sir Bradford . skipping back a generation , reproduced his grandfather 's nature ; and untrained gift for mechanics of all sorts . As a boy he was particularly devoted to ships and boats . " I Used to love to spend my luncheon hour on the river every day when I was at school , " he says . - ' ) And in order to do so I resorted-to all kinds of subterfuges ! My brother and I attended the Mercer 's College , which was a good five miles from our home , and every day my father gave us both the money for our bus fares . In order to save enough for my trip to the river I used every day to Tun all the way home , my young brother riding on top of-the bus carrying both lots of preparation books ! They were horse buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I ones  --  they never stopped all the way , ' tnd as I had to arrive home at the same me as my brother , I had to run the five the Hugli. to Calcutta It . - wag pran  --  A ' fleetly an estuary ... yery : wide ; - and the ' soil nothing but silt . For years . it was considered unbridgeable . The railway stopped acrossthe river from Calcutta . " This seemed to me absurd . I thought out and designed a floating bridge and ; submitted it to the committee . ? The committee sat upon it , and after the manner of committees decided that At could n't be done , and that if it was done it would n't last . ' But Lord Mayo . was ; Viceroy at that time . Now , he was some-. thing you do n't meet often nowadays  --  ai real man . and in the right job . And Z. had told Lord Mayo of my idea apt ! . shown him the plans on one of our week-end holidays . Lord Mayo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " always said one should be able to arIP ones self from Saturday to Mondar . Well . anyway . overriding the committee , he decided that the bridge should be built , and I was ordered to proceed . " Only , as the bridge certainly would be a failue , and would n't and could n't last  --  thus the committee  --  I was very-limited in expenditure . I had to build in the cheapest of materials and with no architectural flourishes . The bridge acaordingly was not by any means my . ? r  --  ast beautiful , nor was it my biggest , ' brit it was certainly my most original . for it was the first actual floating bridge alai was ever built . Not a bridge of boats . of coures. but a floating bridge that had no foundations , and yet had a headway of twenty-five feet for river traffic to pass under it . It was finished In 1S74 and is still in use  --  my bridge that would n't last ! " " No , I have never been to America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " but I have relatives there withwhom I correspond , though I have never seen them , And I am very lroud indeed of my American ancestry . I always tell people about it . I have often thought . too . that I would like to go . America is so wonderfully advanced in engineering  --  but of course she has the advantage of so much rocky soil to work on . Well , perhaps I may go there yet and see things for myself . " And being such a yelling 93 , it Is just possible that he might . one of these days . - If so . I 'm afraid he will have to add another volume to his reminiscences .
