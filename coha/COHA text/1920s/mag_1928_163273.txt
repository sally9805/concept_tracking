For months before the Derby one horse was talked of more than any other-Reigh Count , son of Sun Reigh and Contesina . Rumors had gone round that he had lost weight early in the spring , that his time trials were misquoted , that he had pulled a tendon , that he had been poisoned , but although everyone repeated the rumors few believed them . Reigh Count went to the post at 8 to 5 . And on a sodden track at Churchill Downs , Louisville , Ky. , in front of 80,000 people , Reigh Count won the Derby by three lengths . <P> As usual the race lasted a little more than two minutes . As usual the richest sporting gentlemen and ladies had come many miles to see it . There was n't room in the freight yards for all the private cars . On a landing field near the track a line of passenger airplanes was parked . Furnished rooms that rented all year for $5 a week rented for $30 a night . <P> <P> As usual a heavy rain fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long sheds filled with betting machines men and women stood in line to put their money on the mud-horses-Distraction , Bonivan , Bobashela , Toro . Some liked outsiders-Petee Wrack at 20 to 1 , Rumplestiltskin , Sun Beau . Some liked the English colt , Strolling Player . Many thought that Misstep was just as good as Reigh Count and maybe better . Finally when the 22 starters paraded to the barrier , and were sent off , some people yelled , some wept , and some turned pale . " Misstep ! " they shouted . " Reigh Count ! . . . " <P> Misstep was leading . The first time the field passed the stand Reigh Count was in the little group that had been forced to the front . At the eighth pole Misstep still led the wafting line of color moving through the grey air opposite the stands . In her box Mrs. John Hertz of Chicago , owner of Reigh Count , stood with the tears running down her face watching the yellow shirt of her jockey , Chick Lang . As the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Misstep , then pulled away to win . Toro was third and the rest of the field stretched out for a sixteenth of a mile to Strolling Player who ran last . When Reigh Count had had the usual horse shoe of American beauties hung about his neck and Chick Lang had been cheered by the crowd , Mrs. Hertz took home the usual gold plate worth seven thousand dollars and a check for $54,900.
