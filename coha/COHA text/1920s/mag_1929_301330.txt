The myriad eyes of teeming , docile Indians turned in mild approval and amaze , last week , upon Mother India 's three greatest and most potent sons : <P> Mahatma Gandhi <P> The Aga Khan <P> Pandit Motilal Nehru <P> The famed , ascetic Mahatma is the Saint of India 's Hindus ; and the Pandit is now their Sword . The great Aga Khan is neither Saint nor Sword , but a very rich , fat and astute descendant of Prophet Mohammed , and therefore the most influential of Indian Mohammedans . Last week the Aga Khan traveled from his sumptuous home in Bombay ( western India ) to Delhi ( northern India ) , and there prepared to sit as chairman of the all-India Mohammedan Congress . Meanwhile at Calcutta ( eastern India ) the predominantly Hindu so-called Indian National Congress , met under the chairmanship of Pandit Motilal Nehru , and under the aegis of sainted Mahatma Gandhi . These two gatherings-neither of them Parliamentary or authoritative-speak for Mother India , insofar as she is articulate . The pity is that too often her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , however , each assemblage met with fervent protestations that at last Hindu-Moslem unity against the British Raj was about to be attained . Dubious , sympathetic observers watched . <P> Smart British sahibs of Calcutta affected unconcern , when the Hindu Congress met , 6,000 strong , within strolling distance of the leafy Meidan , where sahibs and mem-sahibs take their aristocratic air of an evening . Actually anxious talk buzzed all up and down the English clubs and offices in Calcutta 's busy Chawringhee . It was surely no good sign when the 6,000 delegates and their more than 11,000 sympathizers proceeded to burn huge piles of Made-in-England goods before sitting to business . Presiding hysterically over the bonfire , Pandit Nehru cried : " Hail , soldiers of Swaraj Self-Determination ! Let your shouts ring out when I unfurl our banner ( hoisting it ) . Soon strikes the hour of supreme sacrifice for our Motherland ! " <P> What the haranguing Pandit meant was coldly and succinctly put to the Subjects Committee of the Congress by skinny , self-starved Mahatma Gandhi , squatting as usual on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revered . <P> In unusually keen-cut terms the Mahatma proposed that the Congress deliver to the British Government an ultimatum in the following sense : <P> Either grant to India full and free Dominion Status before Dec. 31 , 1929 ; or from that day forward the Congress will declare a non-violent but absolute boycott of British goods , British officials , British schools , and British taxes . <P> If the Indian National Congress really possessed the prestige to induce all Indians to declare a boycott at Gandhi 's order , even the Empire Prime Minister , big and beefy Stanley Baldwin , might well tremble at the ultimatum of India 's skinny little saint . As matters stand , it can only be said that the Gandhi boycott of several years ago was a serious but not fatal blow to Great Britain 's vital trade with India . Whether a more effective boycott could be staged next year is a question for Hindu Gods-and Mohammed 's Allah-to answer . Last week the Subjects Committee of the Indian National Congress put Saint Gandhi 's ultimatum on the agenda by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
