The Reichstag says that it has paid the Allies no less than 46,600,000,000 gold marks in reparations since November , 1918 , until September of last year . <P> The French , however , cut these figures to 5,843,974,000 marks in their official list of reparations paid . <P> The difference arises from the fact that the Germans are claiming for all their war losses , while the French are counting only what has been placed to the credit of the Reparations Committee .
