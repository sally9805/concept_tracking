Things are looking up in the fisticuff business . For years it has been unexciting largely because it was held in the horny hollow of one man 's hand , Tex Rickard 's . Others sought to enter the field of promotion from time to time but failed because they could not cope with the supreme showmanship of the old master . Then Rickard died ( TIME , Jan. 21 ) . <P> Last week William Francis Carey was elected to the presidency of Madison Square Garden Corp. , the position left vacant by Rickard . When he announced , next day , that he had leased for outdoor bouts both the Polo Grounds and the Yankee Stadium , New York 's big baseball parks , it appeared that the monopoly built up by Rickard was safe . <P> Then came the announcement that Jack Dempsey , former heavyweight champion , had signed a two-year contract to promote boxing bouts with Humbert J. Fugazy . Fugazy long had been the most formidable of Rickard 's rivals . He has never reached the heights , but he has threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most magnetic personality in the fight game today . Dempsey proved as much when he rushed into the breach upon Rickard 's death and by sheer ballyhoo turned the Sharkey-Stribling bout in Florida from a certain failure into a financial success . The Dempsey-Fugazy firm will begin with a lightweight championship battle-Sammy Mandell , the title holder , probably against Ray Miller of Chicago-to be held in Detroit , June 6 . The Messrs . Dempsey and Fugazy say they will build themselves a coliseum comparable to Madison Square Garden within a year . <P> In William Francis Carey , new head of the oldtime Garden , newcomers will find no sleeping adversary . He is 50 , a bronzed six-footer . He was born a farmer 's son near Hoosick Falls , N. Y. , earned $11 with his own cabbage patch while still very young and struck out for the West with that $11 as his capital . He learned rail road construction in the Colorado camps . <P> At 25 he was superintendent of the Culebra Cut of the Panama Canal , blasting and steamshoveling his way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew a beard . When he straightened out several miles of the Northern Pacific R.R. in Montana he risked the loss of $100,000 in equipment by discarding the slow mule-pack transportation and using cows through the swift currents of the Yellow stone River . In 1915 he decided China needed railroads , so he went there , got the concessions , built the roads . During the War he bored a hole through the mountains of Washington to reach the spruce forests and provide building material for airplanes . He has just finished a huge dam in Vermont . <P> At the moment his company is at work on a $41,000,000 railroad through the Andes mountains for the Bolivian Government . He also has signed an agreement to make the largest airport in the world on the Jersey meadows opposite New York . He has always been interested in sports but was drawn into the fight game by Rickard , who picked him as the man to build the new Madison Square Garden when the old one had to be abandoned . He is a millionaire . If he can promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a millionaire again .
