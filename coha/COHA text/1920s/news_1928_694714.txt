txt That the practice of charging contingent fees in accident - cases-  is often abused to the discredit of the legal profession is a statement that can not be challenged . The ambulance-chasers and the shysters - are well organized , and there are said to be members of the police force and hospital attendants who - give them aid and ? cooperation in preparing their cases for the courts . United States Attorney Minim H. TuTTLE , in discussing the question of abating what has come . to be a scandal , did not ask the State Bar- Association to denounce the ' contingent fee in principle  --  but he pleaded for regulation of the practice . Admitting that the contingent fee may have a legitimate use , he proposed that " every - agreement for a contingent " fee in personal injury cases would " at any time be subject to sum " wary court review . " . Nevertheless , Mr. TUTTLE declared . that the . time had come to " clean house " ? in other words , to get rid of the harpies who prey upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great difficulty , of course , in taking summary action against the contingent fee in accident cases is that in principle it is unobjectionable in the general practice of the law . Often the poor litigant who had a just cause would be helpless if responsible lawyers did not come to his relief and propose to pay the expenses of a suit for a share of an award in his favor . If only honest men worked for a contingent fee in accident cases , there would be no abuse , no scandal . Mr. TuTrim 's plan of a court review is not original with him . Assemblyman PHELPS of the Tenth Manhattan District has drafted a bill for the . relief of poor litigants that has a similar purpose . It provides that an application can be made to a court in the case of " a meritorious claim or defense " to employ a lawyer , who shall be paid out of the " recovery , " the amount to be fixed by the court . While the arrangement would ' be useful to litigants , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ambulance-chasers and shysters , it would in no way be prohibitive . They could still pursue and snare thethapless injured who were ignorant of their rights and opportunities under such a law as - Mr . PHELPS proposes . Sometimes it is said that the only thing to do is to deal with each disreputable offense separately on available evidence . But that is to palter with the enormity . Of course , a whole profession can not be indicted for the knaveries of the sordid and =principled , but it ought to be possible to protect both litigants and the good name of the calling by a broad measure of reform that would bring the offenders to book . On Jan. 10 the bat associations of New York petitioned the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court to conduct an inquiry into " ambulance Chasing " and to find a plan to correct the abuses of it . Mr. CHARLES B. , HUGHES appeared ' for ' the City Bar Association , of - which he is President . He said that Milwaukee , had moved against such malpractice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The petition urged that when cases were made out against " ambulance chasers " they be . brought into court " and dealt with according to law . " That might prove to be impracticable in many instances . It would be well to have a thorough inquiry , to go to the ' bOttom . of the abomination , and place all the facts on record . Probably they would ' serve as the basis for remedial legislation .
