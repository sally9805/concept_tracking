The Silver Tassie . The Irish Theatre , nc. , whose roster includes Scans , Culinans , MacGuffins , Ennises , Miceals , Patricks , Liams and Unas , whose sponsors include Llewellyn Powys , Donn Byrne 's widow and Otto Hermann Kahn , have taken over the tiny but gallant Greenwich Village Theatre where for their first production of the season they present a haunting , chaotic play by famed Sean 0'Casey of Dublin , author of Juno and the Paycock ( TIME , March 29 , 1926 ) . Through its symbolism and its brogue you discern the simple story of an Irish footballer who went to war and returned paralyzed below the waist . He then had to roll himself about in a wheel chair while his erstwhile love cuddled another boy . In the meantime a profound and troublous scene has occurred . Avoiding the acute battlefront description of such books as All Quiet on the Western Front , such plays as Journey 's End , Playwright O'Casey reveals a group of infantrymen encamped in a ruined apse behind the lines . There they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but strange and awesome chants . This lyricism , now solo , now antiphonal , now choral , is a poetic , formalized utterance . The diction is abominable-words can only be guessed at-but the import of these Gaelic spirituals can be felt . Mystic and throbbing , they express the soldiers ' gruesome mission and man 's revolt from the ghastliness he has made for himself . <P> The rest is frequently moving realism , always hampered by bad locution . But what you will remember is the ghostly burthen of fear and futility borne by the voices of shadowy warriors . <P> Ladies of the Jury . What theatregoer with a nose for situations would not tingle at the comic possibilities of women doing jury duty ? In the first act of this play , in which a murder trial begins , Mrs. Fiske is to be observed as a lorgnetted , matronly juror . <P> Her misapprehension of court procedure , her harassing interruptions and questions , so acutely demonstrate the feminine at its silliest that men in the audience writhe in remembrance , everybody laughs , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts , acted in the jury room , the spirit languishes . For Mrs. Fiske 's absurd first-act character becomes a smart , dominating woman , and what was almost wicked satire becomes burlesque . The jury is shown in impromptu sleeping regalia . Two lovers are interrupted at their devotions by the snores of a red-headed Irishwoman . There are two crusty moralists , a conventionally exploited Scotsman , a maundering poet-all the stencils of farce , with a brace of beauties thrown in for good measure . <P> Mrs. Fiske 's rapid , casual delivery 's , as ever , expert and sometimes unintelligible . Of the tricks of emphasis and accent she is still past-mistress . In this disappointing play she is accompanied by another oldtimer , Wilton Lackaye , who made mesmerist Svengali famous ( Trilby , 1895 ) , who returns , after a three-year illness , to do an excellent bit as the exasperated Judge .
