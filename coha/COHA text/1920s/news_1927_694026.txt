txt Mr. HUGH FRAYNE on behalf of the American Federation of Labor informs the radio audience that his organization is firmly resolved not to buy a pig  --  or a political party ? in a poke . Organized labor has learned its lesson . It must put its chief trust in economic methods . It must resort to the ballot only " in " so far as results are to be fore " seen to a positive certainty . " In the absence of definite specifications it is to be assumed that the " lesson " learned by organized labor refers to the La Follette candidacy of three years ago . In endorsing LA FOLLETTE the American Federation of Labor did not endorse the idea of a third party . The door was left open for a return to the traditional bi-partisan , reward-yourfriends-and - punish - your - enemies policy . The homecoming process began immediately after the 1924 election and may now be regarded as complete . It may even be conjectured that the late SAMUEL GOMPERS , in rallying to LA FOLLETTE , was far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson . In 1924 the example of the British Labor Party roused bold hopes among a section of the American labor movement , and Mr. GOMPERS probably thought that LA FOLLETTE furnished an opportunity to get the poison out of the system . When Mr. FRAYNE argues that the American workingman without a political party stands far above the European worker despite the latter 's political activities , he begs quite a number of questions . The superior American standard of living is far from entirely explained by a superior American labor policy . A goodly share of the credit belongs to America herself . But that American organized labor has derived substantial gains from its non-partisanship policies is not to be denied . Wu , LIAM ENGLISH WALLING in his I " American Labor and American Democracy " cites an official Federation statement of March , 1917 , to the effect that in just ten years " all " except one of the demands con , " tained in the Bill of Grievances of " 1906 have become the law of the " land . " It was the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lesson of the La Follette campaign was all the more emphatic because of the outcome of the Congressional elections of the same year . It is Mr. WALLING 'S estimate that twice as many votes were cast for " Progressive " Republicans , Democrats and Independents for Congress as were cast for LA FOLLETTE . In 1920 Mr. GOMPERS ruefully admitted that he could count on only fifty " friends " in the House of Representatives . In 1924 there were , by A. F. of L. estimate , no less than 186 . " Suppose , " said President GREEN at the A. F. of L. convention two years ago , " these " men had been candidates upon " the independent political party 's " ticket ? " So quickly was the La Follette lesson learned . The American Federation of Labor is far from thinking in terms of sole economic effort . It is in politics , but it has returned , after a very brief flirtation , to its original aim  --  seeking a majority in Congress .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
