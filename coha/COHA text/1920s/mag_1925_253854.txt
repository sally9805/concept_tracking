Pros and Cons . In China there are , according to various estimates , between 300 and 400 million people . By far the greater part of these are unaware of the events which are taking place in the outside world . But among the millions that inhabit the maritime and adjacent provinces or , conveniently , conscious China , it is otherwise . They have felt the effects of foreign domination and foreign exploitation of their resources , and they have resented the presence of aliens whom they believe to be in China solely for their own gain and whom they rightly or wrongly regard as intruders . <P> There is another side to the picture . Foreigners , however much they have been actuated by self-interest and however much they have contributed to the chaos that is proverbially Chinese , have conferred lasting benefits upon the Chinese people . Monuments of industry , railways , banks , commerce and a hundred other things will always remain tangible testimony of these benefits . No less important is the high degree of safety in time of trouble which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection . Many Chinese recognize all this ; the great majority in " conscious China " are stolidly indifferent ; but the active , educated Chinese , particularly of the student class , has been able to compare the Occidental to his own , older civilization and to find the scales of judgment weighing in China 's favor . Consequently , this class has been able to stir the masses out of their traditional inertia and to fan the smoldering fires of latent indignation into a fiery movement that does not lack analogy to the Boxer uprising of 1900 . Bolshevik influences , including money , are no doubt a contributing cause of the disaffection , but can be largely discounted . <P> The events of the past week must be read in this light . They are , unfortunately , in conflict with Occidental interests , and are endangering the lives of Western people and the Japanese who have largely absorbed Western culture . But , nonetheless , the movement is essentially one for liberty and as such should not fail to command a degree of sympathy , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Events . Riots , strikes , war and general unrest were reported , last week , from Peking in the North to Canton in the South , an approximate distance of 1,650 miles . Chief events : <P> Peking . Students attempted , not without considerable success , to foment a strike of all Chinese workers and to enforce a boycott of the British and Japanese ( TIME , June 8 , 15 ) . Demonstrations were held . Schools and shops were closed . Dead students were carried in parades with the inscription : " Killed by the English in Shanghai. * " Cries of " Kill the British ! " " Kill the Japanese ! " were heard frequently . Part of the native press supported the students and the Government 's policy favored them . Subscription lists were opened and bankers promised aid . After the killings at Hankow ( see below ) , the students demanded that the Government break off diplomatic relations with Britain and oust them by force from their concessions .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
