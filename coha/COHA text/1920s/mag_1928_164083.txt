He that would be a painter must have a natural turn thereto . <P> Love and delight therein are better teachers of the art of painting than compulsion is . <P> To paint is to be able to portray upon a flat surface any visible thing whatsoever that may be chosen . <P> Thus spake immortal Albrecht Drer who could and did portray all visible things whatsoever which were chosen by his often niggling patrons . Last week in his native city-quaint , medieval , storied Nuremberg-men paused to remember that Albrecht Drer died there just four hundred years ago . They prowled up the steep stairs and round the drafty rooms of Drer 's tall house near the Castle Nuremberg . They viewed a great , commemorative collection of his works , and marveled how , at a patron 's whim , he could crowd a mighty canvas with all imaginable detail or turn to portray with simple , moving perfection two Praying Hands . <P> At Berlin the speaker 's rostrum of the Reichstag was surmounted with a wreath of laurel leaves , to honor Painter-Goldsmith-Etcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reichstag stood , for a day , the Christ-like portrait which Artist Drer painted of himself . <P> A second laurel wreath was placed upon the grave of Drer , in St. John 's <P> Cemetery , Nuremberg , last week , by Common Councilman Herr Doktor Wagner . Drawing a deep breath , he declared : " Proudly Nuremberg calls him Son and Master in the same breath ! Today we place a wreath upon this silent hill . Ach ! Vita brevis , ars aeterna Oh , Life is short ( but ) , Art eternal . "
