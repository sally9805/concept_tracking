The American Association for the Advancement of Atheism , Inc. , issued last week the second annual report of its anti-Christian activities . This report was prefaced with a statement of the decalogue of principles upon which the " 4 A " conducts its goings-on . Thus : <P> " The United States not being a Christian nation and its godless Constitution requiring a secular government , the American Association for the Advancement of Atheism demands : <P> " ( 1 ) Taxation of church property . <P> " ( 6 ) Removal of ' In God We Trust ' from coins and of the Cross from above the Flag . . . . <P> " ( 9 ) Secularization of marriage , with divorce upon request . . . . " <P> There followed " The five fundamentals of Atheism , " each neatly defined : Materialism , Sensationalism , Evolution , The Existence of Evil ( " The patent fact that renders irrational the belief in a beneficent , omnipotent being who cares for man " ) , Hedonism . There followed , throughout the Atheists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of this form of religion . It was observed that " . . . there is much atheism in the church , " that , " there is an increasing number of clergymen who conduct ' services ' at which no prayers are offered and where no reference is made to God . ... " A final paragraph expounded the slogan , " Kill the Beast , " with which the cover of the Annual Report was conspicuously adorned : " The hour to overthrow the Church has come . Arise , ye prisoners of the priest ! Strike down the God superstition ! The Clergy are powerful because you are on your knees . Stand up ! ... Be men ! . . . Prepare for the oncoming religious revolution . " The " greatest achievement of the year " was described as the " founding ... of the American Anti-Bible Society . " This organization has been denied a charter , to secure which atheists plan a legal campaign . <P> Like deism , atheism is an entirely logical postulate . Usually , however , an atheist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely , when its novelty has worn off , than a propagandist for God , to preach it on highway and byway . He has not the exclusively Christian satisfaction of saving a soul . When he takes the offensive , he is in the position of a salesman selling precisely nothing at all . Nonetheless , atheists perhaps feel that their offspring are contaminated by biblical training in public schools , that in other respects they are at a disadvantage in the U. S. community . In the back of the Atheists ' report is a list of the Board of Directors of the A. A. A. A. Of these , several are men well-known to the world for qualities other than their godlessness . One is E. Haldeman-Julius , publisher of nickel books ; another is Ira D. Cardiff , noted botanist .
