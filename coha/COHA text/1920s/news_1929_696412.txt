txt Gliding gracefully onto the huge field of the civil:airport of Littoria , fitfully lit up ' by floodlights and beacons , the transatlantic plane Pathfinder at 9:30 o'clock tonight ( 4:30 P. M. New York time ) , completed its long , adventurous journey to Milne . A crowd of from 2,000 to 3,000 persons who had patiently awaited their arrival for hours gave Roger Q. Williams and Captain Lewis A. Yancey a rousing reception , making up in enthusiasm what it lacked in numbers .

Round upon round of cheers resounded when the Americans . waving flying helmets over their heads . posed for photographs sitting on the shoulders of their admirers in the light of magnesium flares . Fliers Moved by Greeting . Williams appeared deeply moved . Intense emotion was written plainly on his face and he at times appeared to be on the verge of tears as he acknowledged the frenzied salutations . Yancey seemed more composed . although joy , happiness and elation were also plainly Visible " on his features . Both airmen were in excellent health and spirits , and although obviously tired after their long pull . which was interrupted only for the few ' hours of their overnight halt at Santander , appeared good for many more miles of flying . The imposingness of the official reception was somewhat marred by false reports of the fliers ' coming which led people here to believe they would arrive at Rome some two hours before they actually did .

The reception , however , gained in spontaneity and warmth for not being too formal . The crowd just brushed the police aside , broke down all barriers and took Williams and Yancey to its heart . Williams and Yancey were borne shoulder-high to the airport hotel . where , in the company of . UnderSecretttrr and other officials of the Italian Government and members of the staff of the American Embassy . several hnttles sof champagne were opened while the tilers ' - hastily recounted the salient Points of their trip from Spain .

They struck land again slightly west of Marseilles ; proceeded due east , passing north of Monaco , and then cut across the Gulf of Genoa to a point between Genoa and Spezia . Thence they followed the coast southward to Rome . They were overtaken by darkness soon after passing Leghorn , but the moon rendered visibility easy . They saw none of the Italian planes sent out . from Rome to meet them . " But we had no difficulty , " they declared , " in picking out the landing field , which was brightly lighted and stood out clearly in the limpid atmosphere against surrounding darkness . " The greatest uncertainty reigned in Rome all day concerning the probable hour of arrival . Predictions ranged from 5 o'clock in the afternoon to midnight . It was also uncertain at which of four possible fields around Rome they would land . Extra editions of newspapers which continued to come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing and then another and succeeded in confusing the public , which did not know what to believe . This probably accounts for the comparatively small number of people who witnessed the American plane 's arrival . Crowd Went Early to Field . Despite uncertainty as to the place and time of the Pathfinder 's arrival , a large crowd had by 5 o'clock in the afternoon made the long trip to the airport . A steady stream of . mo-1 tor cars and buses kept the numbers increasing as the evening wore on . No news whatsoever had been received then of the plane 's progress . ' It was known only that it had start-ed from Santander at 11:20 .. o'clock in the morning . Strict precautions were meanwhile beimg taken to ensure public order . The crowd was confined behind high iron fences , while a large force of police and carabiners were on duty to prevent access to the flying field . A very restricted number of persons received special passes from the Air Ministry to go on the field . As time passed without any news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was considered curious that , with the Pathfinder flying along the thickly inhabited Mediterranean coast , nobody should have sighted it on its passage . However , at 7:40 P. M. the loud speaker announced that the Pathfinder had been sighted over Pisa . The crowd breathed a sigh of relief . In two hours at most , it was calculated , the plane would be at Rome . The announcement was followed about ten minutes later by another that the Pathfinder had been sighted over Chita Vecchia . Civita Vecchia being only forty miles from Rome , it was estimated that Williams and Young would arrive in about twenty minutes . This announcement , however , proved to be erroneous . Acting on the belief that the Pathfinder had already passed over Civita Vecchia , Signor Mussolini went to the airport . He was accompanied by Signor Balbo , Under-Secretary Bianchi of Heine Affairs , Under-Secretary Giunta of the Presidency , General De Pinedo and other high officials . The Premier planned to give the American aviators an official reception and be the first , together with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome . After waiting almost an hour and three-quarters , however , Mussolini returned to Rome . Army Planes Go Out as Escort . but its green body and aluminum wings had been clearly seen . The crowd gave vent to their relief with thunderous applause . Round after round of cheers split the air while the notes of " The Star-Spangled Banner " from a loud-speaker floated over the field . Every eye was strained to catch a sight of the Pathfinder again as it prepared to land . Twice the Pathfinder circled the field . Then suddenly it ducked over the heads of the crowd and glided gtacefully down to a perfect landing in- the middle of the field . Instead , however , of landing along the path marked by the floodlights , it came down at , right angles to it , headed straight for the Tiber River , which , perhaps unknown to the American pilots , runs along one side of the field .

Fliers Call on Mussolini . ROME , July 10 GM  --  Leonard G. Bradford , Assistant United States Consul was the first man to reach and grasp the hand of Captain Yancey as he stepped from his plane , followed by Williams . Mr. Bradford drew the pair over to where Italo Balbo , Under Secretary for Aviation . was waiting , and presented them to Premier Mussolini 's representative . Yancey and Williams were next introduced to Commander Francisco De Pinedo , famous Italian flier . Premiere Mussolini received Williams and Yancy as they drove to Rome from the airdrome . The fliers called at the Premiere'a home villa at Torenia . The Duce , acting as the Minister of Aeronautics , embraced each of them , kissing both on both cheeks . He congratulated them- an said he was sorry he had not been able to see them land . When Yancey and Williams reached their hotel they found that a three-room suite had been prepared for them . It consists of two large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Louis XV style . A hot dinner was ready to be served when the men arrived from the field . Both Yancey and Williams regretted that they could not have reached Rome in one hop , but ? they were sure they could have been able to do so if they could have carried a load equal to that , which the illfated Green Flash , in which they first tried to start from Old Orchard , was capable of lifting . Plans for the immediate future were vague , the airmen said . " I do not know how long we shall stay in Rome , " said Yancey , " but we are not going to fly back . We may take a trip by air up along the coast . " We are sorry , too , that we did not have a chance to meet Captain Kingsford-Smith and the crew of the Southern Cross before they took off from Littorio for Croyden . We have the greatest admiration for him . " For two and a quarter hours preceding the arrival of the Pathfinder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! world , as Premier Mussolini ordered the telephone lines to be closed . The ban was lifted just barely in time for flashing the news of the arrival . " Well , you certainly established one record , " said a bantering American to the aviators . " What was , that ? " asked Yancey . " You are the only two Americans who ever kept Premier Mussolini waiting that long , " was the reply . As soon as it was announced that the Pathfinder - was flying . over Civita Vecchia a general scramble occurred , every one fighting to gain a vantage point from which the landing field could be seen . A few minutes later an escadrille of army pursuit planes passed over the airport headed northward to meet the American aviators . Several flying machines bearing aviation officers also left the airport , all heading northward , anxious to be the first to catch sight of the Pathfinder and escort it to Rome . The minutes passed slowly but there was still no sign of the Pathfinder . Night was falling apace but flares were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and floodlights cut the darkness like , knives searching the sky for the American plane . One by one the planes which had gone to meet . the Americans returned . They reported they had been as far north as Civits . Vecchia without seeing a sign of them . Each time the roar of their motors was heard ov - head the crowd cried with delighted relief but each time its eagerness was disappointed . As the hands of the clock crawled round to 9 and then to 9:30 , the anxiety of the crowd grew ' painful . Strange rumors were circulated . ' Some said the Pathfinder was forced to land . Others-said . it Was-headed ' toward one of the other flying fields near Rome . Others still said it had missed Rome altogether and was on its way to Naples. , Nervous tension reached a high pitch and the crowd was in a mood to believe anything . Thousands of eyes scanned the sky and thousands of ears were strained to catch the roar of the motor .
