The Lords <P> Placed the Labor Government in a technical minority by passing 42 to 21 ( with 674 absences and abstentions ) a resolution which deplored Prime Minister James Ramsay MacDonald 's recognition of Soviet Russia ( TIME , Nov. 18 ) . The vote came after a sneering , sarcastic harang by the Earl of Birkenhead , bitter Moscow-phobe . " I am almost convinced by the Government 's orators , " said the bitter Earl , " that Soviet propaganda is either wholly innocuous or positively beneficial to Great Britain . Perhaps we ought to subsidize it ! " <P> Paradox of the debate : Anglo-Soviet rapprochement was vigorously though un successfully championed by the Most Reverend Cosmo Gordon Lang , Archbishop of Canterbury , Primate of All England , who thundered : " I favor the creation of some direct channel through which we may protest the Soviet oppression of ministers of religion ! " <P> Despite the deploring vote of Their Lordships , Sir Esmond Ovey left London last week for Moscow as His Majesty 's ambassador to the Reds . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , despite the fact that , for the first time since the War , the wine and spirit list of the House of Commons bars was revised to include " Finest Russian Liqueur Vodka . . . is. 6d " 36 .

Then upon hobnailed feet rose sturdy John Wheately , a Scotsman from the industrial Clydeside slums of Glasgow , five years ago Minister of Health in the first MacDonald Cabinet . <P> " My God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speeches made at the general election by people Laborites around me now , the appeals to the class among whom I was brought up to put their faith in us-when I come here and have to listen to a Minister of Labor telling us she has to steel her heart against a demand for 50,000 to alleviate the worst form of suffering amidst the poorest of the poor ! It makes me almost burst with indignation at the dishonesty of politics ! "
