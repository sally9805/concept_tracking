In Rumania one may refer to Prince Nicholas , weak-chinned younger son of Dowager Queen Marie , as a ? " bully , scandal monger and speed-fiend , " but it will cost one just four months in jail . Some weeks ago Speed-Fiend Nicholas crashed into a taxicab and in pettish rage " kicked the chauffeur severely under the stomach so that the unfortunate man had to be rushed to the city hospital . One Mircea Damian wrote to the local newspapers in protest , not only calling Prince Nicholas bully , scandal monger and speed-fiend , but adding : <P> " I propose to ask the Government to supply the Prince with a tank in which he can drive pellmell through the streets and so destroy all automobiles , bakers ' carts , the officers ' casino , the academy , the athenaeum , the university , and all state and private institutions , and kill every traffic policeman who tries to stop him . " <P> Last week Mircea Damian , author , began serving his four-month sentence .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
