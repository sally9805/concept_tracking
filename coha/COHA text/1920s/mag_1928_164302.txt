Last week , citizens respectful of the law paid income tax . The Federal Reserve Banks throughout the obedient land arranged ledgers to dodge the accounting strain . In one day , in Manhattan alone , the District Bank turned over $2,000,000,000 without rippling the glassy calm of the money market . Treasury certificates for $550,000,000 were redeemed ; $560,000,000 of fresh Government obligations were sold to the prudent . $450,000,000 income tax was collected , and " easy " money " ruled ' ' because banks had the use of money represented by income tax checks for several days ( before return of checks ) for nothing at all .
