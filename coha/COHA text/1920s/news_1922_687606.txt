txt Carrying out the most ambitious burglary enterprise on record in New York City , a band crossed the " dead line " in great force and ripped open seven safes on Thursday night and early yesterday morning in the twenty-story building of the Royal . Insurance Company at William Street and Maiden Lane , almost in the centre of the greatest financial district in the world . The building was thrown open to the burglars  --  nine in number ? by a former member of the Police Reserve , who got the job of night watchman on the strength of his record of three years of service as a reserve policeman and of a letter of recommendation written on Police Department stationery by Police Capt . J , J. Wall of the East Sixtyseventh Street Station . This reservist ? George Breckenridge , 1,480 Avenue A ? was found on the eighth floor tied with ropes , but was forced to admit that he had deliberately let the burglars in . Brought Strong Credentials . Breckenridge got the job five weeks ago , , apparently planning then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the band of safe breakers . Ex. . ceptional credentials , were demanded by the Royal Insurance Company , which is in , the burglary insurance business as well ? as in other ' lines of insurance . Breckenridge had by far the best ' line credentials , which included letters from Brokaw Brothers , the ? Suburban Homes Company and others , as well as the endorsementof the Police Captain . Breef. - enridge had lived with his mother for eight years in the same house and had , a good record , which seemed to justify the impressive ? charaCter testimony which he was able to present . The nine burglars drew the shades , turned on the lights and worked in relays on their braces and bits . Crumbs and bits of sandwiches indicated that they had carried a lunch and had interrupted their seven-hour stay in the building to take a light meal . From the seven safes they got about $4,000 in cash and stamps , about $30,000 in bonds and a bundle of stock certificates , most of them of little value . Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced hasty action from Police Commissioner Enright . He issued , : immediate orders canceling all police - vacations until further notice . This is the beginning of the , vacation season , and but for the order the force would , : have been diminished at the rate of 200 or 300 a week by vacations and later on would have been diminished at- an even heavier rate . Another drastic , order , indicating . Commissioner Enright 's admission that a crisis exists in the crime situation , was a direction to all Police Captains to sleep at the stations which they command and to remain subject to call twenty-four hours a day . A third order canceled the half hour for lunch for patrolmen . A fourth required all Police . Inspectors to make nightly tours of inspection in their districts . Late last night Police Commissioner Enright issued another order requiring ' all policemen doing Bureau duty at Headquarters to report nightly at the station of the precinct in which they live for two hours of police duty each night . In its attack on Commissioner Enrighf on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to " soft berths " at Police Headquarters . All of these orders were made effective at midnight last night . In their invasion of the financial district the burglars crossed the " dead line " in automobiles and were admitted to the building in a body by Breckenridge . At first he said they rushed by him . Later ho admitted that he led them into the basement , where  --  they remained quietly for an hour until the last tenant was out of the building . The fact that burglary on a wholesale scale had been going on for hours in the district became known to the police at 5:10 o'clock yesterday morning . Broken Glass First-Clue . A jingle of glass on the pavement in William Street in front of the Royal Insurance Company wt e:is heard by-Policeman Kane of Old Slip Station . The street was empty in front of him . When he got to the sidewalk where the sound had " come from he found scattered bits of glass . The source of the broken glass Was not obvious . After studying the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patrolman discovered on the eighth floor a hole as ? if a hammer had been ' driven through the window . Kane ' and Policeman Scaaf , who had by him , then entered the building by the front door , which he had found open . Hurrying up the staira , ' they found floor after floor lighted , doors open , safes broken open and papers scattered about . From ? fingerprints anti other evidences it became . apparent later that the burglar band had entered offices on ' nearly every floor ; had fingered and tapped a ? scare or more of safes and finally had opened the seven which appeared most promising . When they got to the , eighth floor they heard groans . Near ' . thebroken Ceptinued.on Page:Xeer. bonds and stocks of par value of about $80.000 , but of incsonsiderable real value . The $29.000 worth of bonds belonging to Mr. Dayton had been placed , in the Safe to remain there only a day or two be1 fore they ? were to go to a vault . This piece of luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fortune . The safe was carelessly locked . The burglars did not have to ' crack " it . . Apparently a combination expert among them found its condition and opened it with a twist of the wrist . Locked boxes in the interior were chisled out . The absence of sound banking advice , however , was shown in , the rejection of the Grand Trunk bond , which was almost as negotiable as currency . They had financial judgment enough , however , to hold on- to- several Liberty Bonds . The ' offices entered and- robbed were the following : Second floor , Dayton &; Bailey ; fourth floor , Queen Insurance Company of America and the New York . and Hanseatic Corporation . an importing and exporting ' house ; sixth I floor , the Royal Insurance Company ; eighth floor , the Russia Insurance Company ; eighth floor , Royal Indemnity Company , and fifteenth floor , Royal Insurance , Compant , Ltd . One - of the mistakes of the burglars was made in- the offices of the- New . York and Hanseatic Corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? there by a customer , - boring through the door and , ripping it off . This ' contained papers of , no value to burglars . The , ludo -- of the corporation window they found a man stuffed in a huge canvas bag in which waste paper ordinarily is kept . He was enmeshed in ropes . He trembled , groaned and told of shooting pains in his head . " They fractured my skull , " he muttered and then apparently fell back into unconsciousness . The two policemen telephoned to the Volunteer Hospital for an ambulance and then to the Old Slip Station for more detectives and policemen . Dr. Joseph L. Rothfeder arrived in a few minutes from the hospital and began fingering the skull of the former reserve policeman , who professed to be in agony . " You 're hurting me something awful , " he told the physician . " There 's no swelling at all , " said the physician . " They hit me with an iron bar and crushed it in. " said Breckenridge . The physician , policemen and detectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door at 9 o'clock , when the bell rang . The building is not locked up for the night until a later hour . Once open , nine men rushed him , the watchman said , took his keys away , heat , bound and gagged him . He had remained unconscious for hours . the watchman declared . and just at about dawn recovered the use of his brain . He was unable to release himself from the ropes ' about his arms and legs , he said , but he managed . in spite of the embarrassment of the canvas bag , to roll himself over to the floor in the front of the building . Here , bracinlg himself on his back and shoulders ; he lifted up his feet , tied and baged as'they were , and kicked through the window with his heels . " Why , this is plateglass , " said the physician . " The blow that broke this would have easily cracked a man 's skull . it must have been done with a hammer or an iron bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , braces . bits and burglars ' tools scattered all around . There were no cuts on the bag or on Breckenridge 's heels where he said they had broken the glass . Under a heavy fire of questions at the building , . then at the 014 Slip Station , ' Breckenridge was tripped , up so often ' and confronted with . so many discrepancies in his story ' that he finally con : - reseed . From the-crudity which market : his part of the crime , the detectives thought he was - telling the truth when he said it was his first offense and they were inclined to classify the former . reserve asa. , victim of . ' crime ? . epidemic , induced to - Commit his first , crime by hardened professionals who convinced him that the watchman-burglar role was a safe and sure method of making a fortune . Breckenridge apparently had been such an easy dupe as to rely on the word of the other nine to give him a share of the plunder at some later date . Later , however , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had for a time worked for Elwood Cox Adams , who is now in Sing Sing for arranging burglaries which resemble in type the Royal Insurance Building burglary , . Adams trained young women to become burglars , got them positions as domestic servants and induced them ' to rob their employers or to leave the doors open for other rbbers . Breckenridge said he had been night watchman at 123 William Street more than a year ago when Adams was there , that he knew of the burglary schemes of Adams and that he had told what he knew to the District Attorney . Much Booty Overlooked . In ranging through law , offices , importing and exporting offices and insurance offices , the burglars had made a long series of mistakes , frequentlypassing by those with rich contents for safes with business papers of little value . Their greatest mistake was in choosing the wrong night . If they had postponed the burglary twenty-four hours , they probably would have obtained payrolls from the Royal Insurance Company and other firms of between $35,000 and $45,000 . They wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gloves and tools indicate that they had tapped and . tested most of the safes which they did not open , rejecting them because they seemed to promise less reward or because th work of opening them would be too arduous . No nitro glycerine was used , the burglars apparently fearing that the noise of explosions , however muffled , might make itself heard in the profound silence of the financials district at night . To " crack " seven safes by- hand is a big job , and each of the nine men had plenty to do . Many of the safes were carried to positions where the industrious mechanics had more elbow room for the use of their bits , jimmies. and " can openers . " Burglars Worked Bard . In the first place , the ' brace and drill bit was tided to bore through steel plate near the lock . This is unskilled labor in which all nine could work hi relays , and the puncturing of nine safes was a night 's work for - the whole crew . The puncture once made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jimmy - could be inserted for wrenching , -a section of , the door , making room for work on the mechanism of the lock .. The first safe ' tackled was the ' easiest and the richest in its yield . ' - This was in the- office . of Dayton ' Bailey , lawyers . on the second - floor . Here - they* got-.several , hundred dollars:a$29,000 in itself contained several hundred dollars . The burglars had moved it about , apparently trying to shake it to see what the contents sounded like . They had also left marks of crowbars where they had jabbed it in a further sound test . This was a light , thin safe which easily could have been opened , but the burglars apparently concluded that it ewas used chiefly as a filing place for important books and papers . Many of the documents stolen from the safe of the customer were later found on the fourth floor , in the office of the Queen Insurance company of America . Here also was found a ' small steel drawer from . the safe of the customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently abandoned as too bulky to be carried off to be broken into at leisure . Another mistake was made on the fifteenth floor , where a comparatively barren safe of the Royal Insurance Company was opened , while one containing several hundred dollars was not disturbed . The following statement was made last night by Colonel Oscar H. Williams , aid to Inspector John F. Dwyer , commanding officer of the police reserves : " Breckenridge was a member of the Police reserve at the time when it had no legal status . In September , 1920 , when the reserves , were given a legal standing and the outfit was reorganized , Breckenridge was dropped from the rolls . He was dropped for police reasons . He has not been connected with the reserves since that time . Colts Doubt . on Letter . " The letter purporting to have been written by Captain Wall of the East Sixty-seventh Street Station may have been a forgery , or possibly the letter simply stated that Breckenridge had been a member of the police reserves and while thus connected had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods . apparently were imitated by Brecken ridge. - was called a. " moral leper " and sent to Sing Sing for ten years by Judge Alfred J. Talley in General Sessions . " It is almost incredible , " said Judge Talley , " that any human being could have crowded so much vicious crime into so short a period and have committed so many inhuman acts . " The series of new drastic regulations for - increasing men on patrol and incuring - strict attention to . duty was an-. flounced by Chief Inspector William al- . Lahey , r at a conference of Police Inspectors , at Police Headquarters yesterday afternoon . The requirement that Police Captains remain on duty was intended , it was said , to insure that the most responsible officer of the precinct ' would be present to handle - any critical police situation in the precinct . The - order compelling - Inspectors to. make - personal tours of their inspection districts at night was to insure ' the utmost vigilance . in patrolling beats . The abolition of the half-hour lunch period was caused by ' reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave . the excuse that ? they were tieing theirhalf-hour lunch period . Bond Descriptions Sent Ont . Descriptions and serial numbers of the bonds were immediately sent out to banks and to the companies issuing the bonds , and the lawyers are hopeful that they will recover their property . The burglars might obtain loans on the bonds from careless financiers or ' bond fences , " but they are so likely to be caught in trying to negotiate them that they are not apt to offer the securities now . A number of stock certificates , one endorsed bond of the Grand Trunk Railroad for $1,000 , which would be readily negotiable , and legal papers of the , Dayton &; Bailey firm , were found scattered all over the building. ? It was apparent that the burglars had twice interrupted their labors in order to sit as a Board of Directors and consider their financial standing , On the fourth floor and on the sixteenth , both occupied by , offices of the Royal Insurance Company , documents were scattered in all directions from a central point  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mortgages , promises to pay , Insurance policies and other papers . Apparently the burglars had at each place heaped the contents of their various safes in a pile and ekercised their united wisdom as to the chances of converting each bundle of paper into cash .
