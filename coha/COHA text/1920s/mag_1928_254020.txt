It is easy enough as a rule to scrape acquaintance with a Pullman waiter . Dr. Frank Gonzales . President of the Armour Institute , quite often exchanged words with Archibald J. Motley who ran the buffet on the " Wolverine " between New York and Chicago . When he found out that Mr. Motley had a young son who liked to paint pictures , he sent for the son and looked at the paintings . This done , he offered to finance Archibald Motley Jr . through his first semester in the Chicago Art Institute . <P> During the ten years that followed , Painter Motley had to work hard . He waited on dining-car tables , did some light plumbing , some heavy coal-heaving and painted a lot more pictures . One of these , A Mulattress won him the Frank G. Logan medal and prize at the Chicago Art Institute Exhibition in 1925 . Last week he achieved the honor of a one-man exhibition in Manhattan , an honor which , so far as is known , no Negro has ever before achieved . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pulitzer , part-owner of the N. Y. World . <P> The pictures , orthodox in technique and lacking the extravagant coloring which Negroes are supposed to like , were good . Technically , the best were Artist Motley 's studies of mulattoes , octaroons , quadroons , his Portrait of My Grandmother , and a gay and decorative panel , Parade . Ralph Pulitzer bought Octaroon . But the spectacular and atmospheric illuminations of East African voodooism were more original and hence more noticed . Painter Motley has seen the crowd of anxious dark faces at a fortune teller 's door , waiting to be told what numbers to bet on in a gambling game . He paints the same crowd , their black skins grey in the light of a jungle moon , capering through the mad tendrils of a mango grove . <P> Mahonri Young 's sculpture , at the Rehn Gallery , was certainly the best exhibition seen in Manhattan since Jacob Epstein flashed his gauche madonnas on a startled babbittry ( TIME , Nov. 28 ) . Those who like to read sermons into clay could speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had modeled peasants with sad and sensitive faces , a young girl ( Spring in Brittany ) , Porteuse de Pain , and Porteuse de Poissons , figures of women bent beneath burdens , so as to include not a story but the pitying emotion of a fine novel in their strong and individual faces . His prizefighters were less successful .
