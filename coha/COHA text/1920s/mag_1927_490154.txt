THE CONDUCT of practically every person connected with the latest scandal in professional baseball circles has been entirely lamentable . Nobody at all seems to have behaved himself with thorough straightforwardness or thorough sense ? and at the moment of this writing there begins to appear in the whole affair a sinister implication : the hint of ulterior purposes , some huge diplomatic movement which the gentlemen on the inside presume will be , in the end , for the good of the game and its handsome profits . Mr. Dutch Leonard , the gentleman possessed of the accusing finger , is apparently a watery sort of chap . He became aware ( he says ) in 1919 of crookedness . But he waited , in the uneasy situation of accessory before and after the fact , until everybody involved in the deal had retired from the profession . And then he bawled his charges over the back fence , ran like a rabbit , and refused with all stubbornness to come back and face the men whom he accused . Judge Landis has proceeded , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is apparent he knows either a great deal more than he has divulged , or a great deal less than he has implied . Messrs . Cobb and Speaker themselves have not behaved quite convincingly . One feels that it was somehow unnatural for Cobb to allow himself to be waived out of the major leagues last fall , with never a complaint , never an alibi , never a manifestation of his old spitfire temperament . Speaker was willing to slip off into obscurity in the same quiet way . BUT THE most deplorable per-formance of all was vouchsafed by the newspaper reporters whose duty it became to chronicle the succession of events for our enlightenment . They have given us , to date , more wretched reporting than any other event of the last ten years has called up . At every turn , when some truth began for a moment to disclose itself , they have summoned their resources to baffle us . There they were ; expert men who have followed baseball for years , acquainted with half the players in the game , swarming about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery of the truth . More , the peculiar status of the sporting page columns gave them every opportunity for the expression of editorial opinion , the statement of those half-facts ( often more illuminating than whole ones ) with which the case has abounded . And the best they could give us was a series of lack-luster stories , filled with obscure suggestions that mystery was afoot and the good old game was about ready for the ash can . There has not been , yet , the bold statement of a single truth . One has never been able to say : " Here is a reporter who is determined to get at the bottom of this thing and let me know about it . " XT EWSPAPERS are in a rather unusual relation toward baseball ? a relation that is quite different from that which they bear toward the oil industry , say , or the profession of medicine . For the newspapers made baseball . They literally drove it down the throats of the Babbitts who inhabit these shores . Of course , the newspapers reaped certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon papers in most large cities are the editions which make afternoon papers possible . And in view of this relation , the newspapers , up to a certain time , held themselves in the attitude , more or less , of guardians of the game . Up to a certain time , the baseball writer was a chap who defended the integrity of the sport most jealously . He was constantly on the watch for mysteries and dishonor . But when Judge Landis was made high chaperone to the profession , the newspaper men relaxed their vigilance . They , too , accepted the learned man of the bench as a sort of minor god . And it was this attitude of theirs which permitted the current scandal to become so muddled and so entirely unsatisfactory . On the morning , for instance , when the newspapers first published Leonard 's long story accusing Cobb and Speaker and Wood of arranging the outcome of a game inadvance , and betting on the sure thing thus provided , there was lamentation and bitterness between the lines of every writer handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skepticism . There was hardly a word of doubt concerning the truth of the story  --  except such perfunctory words as are usual in the case of a newspaper chary of libel suits . They simply took Judge Landis 's word for it , and wept : not even bothering to murmur , " Tell us it ai n't true , Joe . " Even Mr. W. 0 . McGeehan , steadiest of the sporting critics , grew angry and ironic . By every implication , he accepted the Judge 's word for the guilt of the stars , and scorned himself for having written , a few weeks before , a long chant of praise for Cobb and Speaker , the grand old men of the game , who were passing from its lively scene . He acknowledged himself a sucker for having written sentimentally concerning the careers of these players . He did not sit hack dubiously and wonder if the charges against them were true . OO COURSE , things changed a great deal during the next three or four days . The reporters , rushing to Landis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The story was a washout . And so , according to their several prejudices , the reporters began to hammer conclusions from the details given them in the first instance . Some of them assumed the players were guilty , and proved it . Some assumed the men innocent , and proved it . Most of the proofs were simply vaporings . But as a consequence of this state of affairs , practically no sense at all can be gotten from the papers , as I write , concerning the evidence that is actually in hand . There have been a few editorials , most of them intelligent yet relying for their information solely upon the accounts in the sporting columns . There has been no old-fashioned sleuth-reporting which this sort of story , above all others , needs . And this seems strange indeed . For most baseball writers have , in time past , admired and indeed worshipped these men , Speaker and Cobb and Wood . They have certainly been among the best  --  players as well as humans  --  that the game has produced . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone out to prove his man innocent , and done it . I am sure that he could do it , with a little work . CHANCE , of the very purest sort , brought me to a meeting with a ball player of the old days , a chap who does n't play any longer but watches games , and watches his profession with a hawk 's eyes . And he offered an explanation . T have no idea how sound it is . Indeed , when it is committed to paper it may appear ut- terly absurd . But I will give it to you , anyway  --  on the chance that it may be interesting : MHE GAME , he says , is honey- " - combed with crookedness . There is the open crookedness of owners buying and selling players to the indignation of the fans , of crack teams being broken down because their steady winning has become a bore . And there is the crookedness of all the youngsters who are made dizzy by the money that flows through the trade . They will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cash that floats about their heads , and thrown games are by no means rare . The magnates ( I continue the veteran 's story ) are aware of this , and tremble against the day when the general dishonesty of players and managers will burst upon the public in one horrible explosion . They have sought ways of disciplining the athletes , but none of them have succeeded . Until at last they hit upon the scheme , that very old scheme , of teaching by example rather than by precept . The magnates knew of Leonard 's charges against the three stars . And they decided , at last , to make these charges public for whatever effect it might have upon the younger generation of ball players . The accused men would not be greatly hurt , it was argued , for they were out of baseball in the first place , and would undoubtedly be proven innocent at the last , in the second place . But the youthful players , constantly faced by temptation , would be brought up sharply . " These owners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out to get the crooked ones sure enough , if they 'll pile into Cobh and Speaker with no more evidence than that . " Ultimately : Cobb and Speaker cleared . The public convinced that the men who own baseball are honest souls , determined to expose crooked-ness or even a hint of crookedness , no matter whom it hurts . The young players frightened into at least a temporary refusal of all juicy offers from the gamblers . So much for the veteran ball player 's story . Make what you like of it . Of course it is apparent that the magnates must exert every possible energy to keep the game free of excessive dishonesty . There are a good many millions of dollars invested in stadia , and franchises , and high-priced players over the land . OR THE REST , it seems unlike- ' : ly that anything substantial will ever come of the current episode . Very rare indeed are the people who actually believe in the guilt of Cobb and Speaker and Wood . It is all too absurd , and the stakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman who took the bets has announced that they were concerned with a horse race , and not a baseball game . And even if Speaker did say , under the grandstand , " Well , Cobb , I would n't be surprised if you won a ball game tomorrow , " nobody cares much . We expect our ball players to play with all their talent and even rime fierceness to win pennants . That is part of the contract when we buy a ticket at the gate . But after the pennant is won . . . . Well , no bridge player can get his blood up over the last rubber , when he is already five thousand points ahead . The athletes are really under no obligation to cut eac t others ' throats out there on the diamond . And if tail-of-the-season indifference to victory is to be a matter for indignation and criminal proceedings , what of the game that Nick Altrock pitched last year ? Surely , he was not expected to win it . BASEBALL is not particularly im- portant . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circus , or the soda industry , or the Anti-Saloon League , or the New York National Guard . But it is , in several ways , a pleasant sort of thing for a good many people . It is probably much better that it be kept honest . The only people who can keep it so are the newspapers . And the newspapers , as we have just been able to observe , are not doing the job very well these days .
