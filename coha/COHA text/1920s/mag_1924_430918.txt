 | THE fascinating , instructive , and profitable pastime of keeping and cultivating goldfish has many devotees in the United States , and recent years have witnessed a widespread increase of interest in the subject . This interest is one aspect of the noteworthy movement which impels both young and old to get close to Nature and to become familiar with the behavior and requirements of living creatures . The popularity of the goldfish as a special object of attention depends on the attractive form and color of the different varieties , on the readiness with which they submit to the limitations of amateur knowledge and facilities , and on the low cost and ease of obtaining desirable fish for stocking ponds , fountains , and home aquaria . Nevertheless , only a small proportion of our people have as yet come under the goldfish spell . Few have partaken of the delights of association with any of the varieties of the goldfish species , but a genuine treat awaits the men , women , and children who for the first time venture into this seductive field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used of all purely ornamental creatures . In the number and distinctiveness of varieties that have been produced by cultivation , it holds front rank among animals . In the exquisite beauty and astonishing combinations of form and color that have been achieved by the fanciers of Asia , Europe , and America through long generations of patient effort , it occupies an absolutely unique position . THE WILD GOLDFISH IS A PLAIN CREATURE Although it is one of the best-known fishes in America at the present time , we must bear in mind that the cultivated goldfish is an Asiatic immigrant . Welcomed to our shores nearly fifty years ago , it not only has adapted itself to our environment , but has undergone substantial improvement and acquired features that have a distinctive American stamp . The goldfish belongs to the Carp , or Minnow , family ( Cyprinid e ) , which has several thousand members , with representatives in nearly all temperate and tropical parts of the world . The Cvprinidce are most numerous in Asia and North America and are one of the most important of fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the numerous cultivated varieties of goldfish have been derived is a plain , inconspicuous species , without any suggestion of the remarkable possibilities of development in form and color to which it has proved susceptible . The body is moderately elongated and compressed , and covered with large , coarse scales the fins are relatively small ; the color is plain olivaceous . A length of from eight to twelve inches is attained . The wild goldfish resembles the common domesticated Asiatic Carp : and Carolus Linnus , the father of the modern system of classification and nomenclature of animals , placed the two fishes in the same genus and called the goldfish Cyprinus auratus , evidently basing his specific name on a golden or cultivated example . The goldfish may be readily distinguished from the Asiatic Carp , however , by the absence of little fleshy appendages , called barbels , at the corners of the mouth . In later zoiilogical works it is assigned to the same genus as the Crucian Carp , or Karass , of Europe and western Asia , and its present-day scientific name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , where it still abounds in a wild state . It exists also and is widely distributed throughout Japan , but there is a possibility that the wild fish may not be indigenous in Japan , but has escaped  | from cultivation and reverted to its original character , just as it has in Europe and America . EARLY CULTIVATION OF GOLDFISH IN ASIA It was only natural that the attraction and possibilities of goldfish cultivation should have been realized at a very early date by a people so clever and imaginative as the Chinese , who must be given credit for establishing the colored variety of the wild fish , for initiating , for a purely ornamental fish , a fashion which has never waned , but has grown in popularity with each succeeding century , and for developing new features in color and form which became the basis for most or all of the remarkable varieties that are known to modern fanciers . At a very remote time the Chinese began to breed goldfish and to produce new varieties . It has been said that the Koreans also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no existing evidence of original work on their part . The colors and forms the Chinese apparently favored and eventually established may be regarded as indications of the artistic instincts of the race . It is interesting to observe that the expression of Chinese art as manifested in goldfish lay mainly in the production of grotesque , bizarre , or horrifying forms . This was in strong contrast with the Japanese , the other Oriental race among which goldfish breeding reached an advanced stage at a comparatively early date , who have in general sought to produce the graceful , harmonious , and pleasing . Characteristic features which the Chinese engrafted on the goldfish stock are dragon eyes , finless backs , and calico colors . In Japan the colored goldfish has been known from the year I5oo . It went in from China , either by direct importation or by intermediary steps , through Korea or the Ryu-Kyu ( 1 , u-Chu ) Islands , as subsequent importations did . The cultivation of goldfish in Japan doubtless  | began not long after the original importation . Between 1700 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the author has visited a goldfish establishment in the same region that had been in continuous operation since 1763 . The Japanese at an early date began to improve on the goldfish introduced from China . They employed original methods of culture and applied their innate skill and perseverance in developing hitherto unknown characters , with the result that eventually many new varieties were brought into existence , the apanese became the leading goldfish breeders , and Japanese varieties were soon known around t h e world . IMPORTATION Or GOLDFISH INTO FUROPE AND AMERICA Early European travelers in China took back accounts of the striking goldfish which they found being cultivated in various parts of the Celestial Empire , and finally some living specimens reached Europe . Only a very hardy fish could have withstood such a voyage , with the imperfect facilities for transportation and the limited knowledge of fish requirements that then existed . The first goldfish to reach Europe may have arrived in England as early as the time of James I ( 1566-1625 ) , but a more authentic date is 1691 . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is recorded that about the middle of the eighteenth century goldfish were brought from China as a present to Madame de Pompadour , of the court of Louis XV . In more recent years goldfish varieties were extensively imported from Japan , and goldfish rearing began in Great Britain and on the continent of Europe , the most successful fanciers being Germans . The direct importation of Oriental goldfish into the United States began at a comparatively recent date . The first specimens seem to have been brought over by Rear Admiral Daniel Ammen . U. S. N. , in 1878 , and fish of that lot presented to the United States Fish Com-  | missioner were extensively bred at the Government nurseries in Washington . Subsequently , large numbers of Japanese goldfish were brought into the United States by private fanciers and by regular dealers , and other importations were made from Europe . The different Asiatic varieties have now been so widely and successfully introduced into the United States and may be grown in such large quantities that further importations are for the most part unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EVOLUTION OF THE ORNAMENTAL GOLDFISH In a rather numerous group of fishes to which the goldfish belongs there is a well-marked tendency toward albinism . The Golden Ide , the Golden Tench , the Golden Carp are examples of related fishes , highly ornamental varieties of which have been established from dullcolored wild species . A deficiency of the olivaceous pigment in the skin of the wild goldfish would leave a whitish , yellowish , or golden color , while irregular distribution or concentration of that pigment would result in a variegated coloration , with dark greenish or blackish spots or areas separated from lighter ones . By the selection of abnormally colored individuals for breeding purposes , light and variegated races were in time established . Abnormalities of shape and structure in wild fish may have been developed and perpetuated in the same way . It seems probable that the color variations came first and that abnormalities in form arose later in incipient or already established color varieties . This may  | have been the result of unnatural conditions attending efforts of the early fish culturists to perfect the varieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a very plastic species , as shown by the profound modifications in form and color that have been brought about in modern times by the experimental efforts of Japanese and American breeders . The end has certainly not been reached , and future culturists may be able to develop varieties as extraordinary as any that have heretofore been produced . It is this possibility that has added to the fascination of goldfish culture , which has been able to hold the interest of amateurs and professionals for so many centuries , other factors being the fish 's hardiness , prolificness , and amenability to complete domestication . The evolution of the modern goldfish varieties has received the attention of biologists of Asia , Europe , and America . The modifications in coloration , form , and structure that have been brought about by cultivation have received the consideration of eminent zoologists.  | What has been achieved has , of course , been in accordance with natural laws , of which all the earlier and many of the later culturists were ignorant , their efforts being largely empirical . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American biologists , stated that the varieties of goldfish " are the most profoundly modified of any known race of domesticated animal organisms . " Especially remarkable is the development of the caudal and anal fins , both of which in the more highly cultivated forms have assumed a character that does not occur in Nature in any species of fish and has not been cultivated in any other species . In the wild fish these fins are always single , unpaired , and placed in the median line ; in a number of domesticated varieties they are double , paired , and located on either side of the median line . Modification of the caudal fin by selective breeding has been one of the special aims and achievements of the modern goldfish fanciers . The extent to which the simple , small tail fin of the wild fish has been gradually developed is one of the wonders of science . Its double form is not a mere superficial splitting of the soft parts , but represents an actual bi-  | ateral separation of the bones from which this fin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have scales , but in the course of cultivation varieties have been developed the scales of which are so thin and transparent as to be inconspicuous and , under certain conditions , almost invisible . It is to such fish that the inaccurate but convenient term of " scaleless " has been applied by fanciers ; " transparent-scaled " would be a better name . The involution of the scales may occur in any of the more highly cultivated varieties . The condition probably originates in fish produced in the warmer parts of China , and is always associated with other characters which are esteemed by many fanciers . The scaleless fish are less hardy than others of the same variety , being very sensitive to low temperatures . They never exhibit the metallic luster often seen in goldfish , but they develop a deeper , richer red than other forms , and they may have blue , purple , lavender , and calico colors that the scaled varieties do not possess . Another peculiarity of the scaleless types is that whereas young of the ordinary fish pass through a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attain their full development , the scaleless young pass directly from their larval blackish phase to their final livery , and may achieve this change in a few months . THE " TELESCOPES " AND " CELESTIALS " One of the bizarre features produced in goldfish by Chinese breeders is an abnormality of the eyeballs , giving rise to varieties known in China as Dragoneyes and in Europe and America as Telescopes and Celestials or Celestial Telescopes . This character originated in China probably at a very remote period . Strangely enough , however , it was unknown in Japanese fish until the close of the Chino-Japanese War , in 1894-5 . Telescopes have been very extensively bred in Japan and America , where new varieties and combinations have been  | effected by the use of the special eye characters . The name Telescope has become generally adopted for these fish , but is not very apt . The eyes are not telescopic ? that is , long-sighted ? but are extremely myopic , or short-sighted . Either the Chinese name of Dragon-eyes or the Japanese name of Demekin ( meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . They seem to be unable to adapt themselves to the protruding eyeball and are likely to injure the eye by swimming against hard objects , and then become blind . The development of the protruding eyes in the Telescopes has been brought about in the same manner that other features of the cultivated goldfish have been ac quired ? that is , by selective breeding . There has , however , been a widespread popular belief , in defiance or ignorance of the laws of heredity , that the peculiar eyes in question have been produced by subjecting the young fish to a course of treatment . In a work , " The Goldfish and Its Culture , " published in New York in 1910 , this absurd notion is given currency in the following words : " The direction of the eyes is artificially produced by straining them when young in the desired angle in dark surroundings with a ray of light from one direction only . " RAISING GOLDFISH FOR MARPET The large and growing demand for goldfish for ornamental purposes and for the delectation of amateurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a trade of considerable magnitude . The raising of the fish for market has attained large proportions , and goldfish farms in various parts of the country supply wholesale quantities for the retail trade . Among noteworthy establishments on a large scale , those in Frederick County , Maryland ; Martinsville , Indiana ; Thornburg . Iowa ; and Langdon , Kansas , may be mentioned . Goldfish farming in Frederick County , Maryland , began about 1889 , and in recent years from 35 to 40 establishments have been in operation , employing several hundred men and boys during the busiest part of the season . The annual output , consisting almost entirely of the common variety , now amounts to between three and four million young fish , which are sent to distributors in Baltimore , Philadelphia , New York , Boston , Cincinnati , Toledo , and other cities . At a goldfish farm in Indiana many varieties are bred in the 200 ponds covering an area of loo acres , with facilities for producing five million fish annually . Ponds in which goldfish are being raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year are taken out , counted , sorted , and then shipped in cans or tubs for the retail trade . Notwithstanding the large number of young goldfish put on the market each season , the demand is usually far in excess of the supply . GOLDFISH SOCIETIES Goldfish breeding establishments are very interesting places and are often centers of attraction for a large district , since they combine landscape , waterscape , and floral features in infinite variety with the practical production of ornamental fish for market . In various American cities , as in Japan  | and Europe , particularly in Germany , goldfish breeders and fanciers have formed associations for mutual pleasure , instruction , and profit . Such societies may be advantageously organized in any community where interest in goldfish culture is shared by even a few persons , and can be made to serve a very useful purpose in the social and business life . Goldfish and aquarium societies now exist in Boston , New York , Brooklyn , Buffalo , Jersey City , Newark , Philadelphia , Lancaster , Pittsburgh , Baltimore , St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most entertaining activities of goldfish societies is the holding of public exhibitions , discussions , and competitions , with the award of prizes for the best specimens of goldfish of different classes . The various societies have adopted fixed rules for judging the quality of different breeds and scales of values for particular features , just as in dog , poultry , and cattle shows . The Philadelphia Aquarium Society , which was one of the pioneers in this field and gave rise to a number of local offshoots with about 300 members , holds monthly meetings for competition among its members , a definite goldfish variety being shown at each meeting , and cups , medals , and other awards being given . The schedule of points adopted by this society gives an idea of the stress placed by amateurs on the outstanding characters of the varieties . Thus , in assigning Too possible points to a fish , a Japanese Fringetail would be allowed a maximum of 24 credits for the shape of body , 26 for the caudal fin , 18 for the dorsal fin , 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fins , 18 for color , and 5 for style ; a Comet would be given 20 points for body , 32 for caudal fin , 20 for dorsal fin , 1 for each of the other fins , 18 for color , and 5 for style ; while a Lionhead might receive 18 points for body , 18 for caudal fin , 5 for anal fin , T for each of the other fins , 32 for head , 18 for color , and 5 for style . A Shubunkin would be allowed 6o possible points for color , and a Telescope or Celestial might secure 18 or 32 credits for eyes . The varieties of goldfish bred by American fanciers at the present time comprise about a score of well-recognized forms with distinctive names , together with a number of minor forms . Nineteen varieties represented in the accompanying plates are the Common goldfish , the Comets , the Fringetails and Veiltails , the Nymphs , the Fantail , the Veiltail Telescopes , the Celestial Telescope , the Chinese or Old Style Telescopes , the Veiltail Moor Telescope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A VARIETY OT ORNAMENTAL PLANTS GROWN IN AQUARIA The plants in a goldfish aquarium are ornamental and they also are extremely useful . They give off oxygen and their roots absorb impurities . Even if tightly covered , an aquarium can support fishes provided it contains a healthy plant growth and is placed in good light . The plants yield enough oxygen , under the influences of the light , to supply the fishes . The Waterweed , the Latin name of which is Anacharis ( see Plate VII ) , is a widely used aquarium plant , with a number of aliases ? Water Pest , Ditchmoss , Pabington 's Curse , and Water Thyme . Its bad names are due to its good aquarium habit of rapid growth . It is mosslike , grows on a fragile stem , and is a good oxygenator . It is so susceptible to light that the same plants present varying appearances in different exposures , especially in the spacing of leaves . The submerged Spatterdock ( see Color Plate VIII ) is a comparatively new aquarium introduction . It has a spadeshaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waterweed . The Southern Spatterdock is valued especially because of its " fast " colors ; its bright green leaves do not darken in strong light . The Japanese Spatterdock has darker leaves , of a sage-green hue , which are broader at the base . The Famvort , whose Latin name is Cabomba ( see Color Plate VI ) , is a veritable wildflower of the ponds along the Atlantic seaboard from Maryland to North Carolina . It can be had in bunches in pet shops and is the popular decoration for the goldfish bowl . Its brittle quality does not recommend it so highly to connoisseurs , because a number of active fish in a large aquarium soon pick it to bits . Its leaves are fine-cut , fanlike , and bright green . One variety , Rose Fanwort , has  | stems of a reddish hue and the color extends to the lower sides of the leaves . Water Seedbox , a species of Ludwigia ( see Color Plate VII ) from South America , is so named for the peculiar capsules in which its seeds are produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the reproductions in this number of THE GEOGRAPHIC , were COMMON GOLDFISH ? WAKIN ( For illustration see Color Plate IV ) Under the name of Common Goldfish , there is recognized in America the variety whose form has departed least from that of the wild fish . The designation is not entirely satisfactory , and it may be desirable to adopt , as a distinctive term , the name Wakin , applied by the Japanese to the simplest and most primitive of the varieties cultivated in their country . In view of the influence exerted by the Japanese on modern goldfish culture and the attractive characters implanted in the goldfish by Japanese breeders , it is not inappropriate to adopt names bestowed by them , as has been generally done in several cases . This variety , in its simplest form , is similar in shape of body and in shape and size of fins to the wild fish . The color is most variable , and it is remarkable that a fish presenting such a wide range of color should have come from the original dull-green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild race has a tendency to produce yellowish or whitish individuals . From these latter , by selective breeding , have been developed , by infinite patience and through long years of experimentation , the Common Goldfish of to-day . While red is the predominant color and may uniformly cover the entire body and fins , it is often associated with white and black . White , silver , pearl , gray , bronze , brown , gold , and other shades also may occur , alone or in combination , and yellow , orange , and other colors may be found . The Wakin exceeds all other varieties in size . It normally reaches a length of from 6 to to inches , but may attain 15 or 16 inches . Under favorable conditions , in ponds , it may attain an age of 20 years . This is by far the most numerous variety bred in the United States , and is the only type known to many people . It presents most of the color phases that are met with in the more highly cultivated varieties , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary public demands . From time to time many of these fish have found their way into open waters by the breaking of dams , the overflowing of ponds , or the deliberate act of man . It may readily be understood that in such an environment , where the struggle for existence is keen and where other fishes have either means of defense or are provided with protective coloration , so brilliant a creature as a goldfish becomes a shining mark made from carefully selected living fish , some in the aquarium of the Bureau of Fisheries , others at the hatchery of a well-known fancier in Philadelphia . Mr. Murayama , the Japanese artist , by patient study and with consummate skill , has reproduced not only the form and color , but the very spirit of the different varieties of goldfish . for all kinds of enemies , and its elimination goes on at a rapid rate . If it exists long enough to breed , a particularly heavy mortality is almost certain to befall the more highly colored young , and it is only a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pair of colored fishes are the dull-colored ones . COMET GOLDFISH ( For illustrations see Color Plates I and VI ) This type of goldfish is frequently called Japanese , but there is no evidence that it originated in Japan and it is disclaimed by the Japanese authorities . On the contrary , there is reason to believe that it is an American product , and may have originated about 188o , in the Government fish lakes , now filled in , that existed for many years in The Mall , near the Washington Monument , in the National Capital . Quite possibly it came into existence independently elsewhere about the same time or earlier , and a pioneer American goldfish breeder , Hugo Mulertt , has stated that he first produced and named it in the summer of 188i , when a long-tailed comet was in the sky . The form does not appear to have been the result of selective breeding , but may have originated as a sport from common Japanese stock . The variety , with modifications , has been firmly fixed by American fanciers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elongated , moderately compressed body and long , flowing fins . The dorsal fin is carried erect , the pectorals and ventrals droop , the anal is single , and the simple caudal , which streams straight backward , is broad , elongated , and moderately or deeply forked . Among all the goldfish varieties , none surpasses the Comet in rapidity and gracefulness in swimming . When to these qualities are added beauty of coloration , hardiness , ability to endure northern winters out of doors , and susceptibility to being bred in either ponds or aquaria , the Comet becomes one of the most striking and popular species . The form of this breed , together with the possible retention of a quality of its wild ancestors , has made of the Comet a great jumper , so that aquaria or other vessels in which it is kept must be covered with a wire-mesh screen . The Comet occurs in both scaled and scaleless varieties , the latter , as elsewhere explained , being not actually destitute of scales , but having scales that are so thin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 381 ) . A  | type of Comet most highly prized in America is scaleless , has a sharp nose and a straight and wide-spreading caudal fin that is as long or longer than the remainder of the fish , and a rich blood-red body color , with white fins . A strain of Scaleless Comets , described as " wonderful , . . . of deep oxblood red color , " was bred by American fanciers at one time , but is reported to have been lost about a dozen years ago . FRINGETAIL GOLDFISH ? RYUKIN ( For illustrations see Color Plates I and VIII ) The Fringetail variety of goldfish is distinguished by an extraordinary development of the tail fin , which is double and as long as the fish and may even be almost or quite twice as long . It forms a great draperylike mass , which falls into graceful pendent folds so ample that , if properly applied , they would completely cover the body . The posterior margin of each half of the caudal may be moderately or deeply forked , constituting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be only slightly incised , constituting t h e Veiltail or Broadtail . This variety has reached a very high degree of cultivation among t h e Japanese , who call it the Ryukin , after the RyuKyu or Lu-Chu Islands , lying between Taiwan ( Formosa ) and the mainland of Japan . The name may suggest the origin of the breed or the route by which it entered Japan . Sent out from Japan many years ago , it is now known , admired , and bred on all the continents . In America it has received the special attention of amateurs and has attained a perfection of form and color never surpassed and seldom equaled elsewhere . Along with the remarkable caudal fin , which in the Fringetail attains a more luxuriant growth than in any other variety , there goes a high development of the other fins , whose size , shape , and texture serve still further to distinguish this fish . The dorsal fin is high , long , and wavy , its posterior rays reaching beyond the base of the caudal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gracefully , the pectorals far overlapping the ventrals and the ventrals extending far beyond the insertion of the anal fin . The anal is double and its vertical base is below the two parts of the caudal , while its tips may reach to half the length of the caudal . The Fringetail is still further distinguished by a short , deep body , a strongly arched back , and a bulging abdomen . The Japanese Fringetail is conspicuously scaled . By crossing with scaleless fish of Chinese origin , American fanciers have produced a Scaleless Fringetail that is larger and excels the Japanese stock in beauty of color and fin development . A variegated coloration , in which a brilliant red may predominate , characterizes the best breed of Fringetails . The richness of the red color is not exceeded in any other variety and is often embellished by a metallic iridescence on both body and fins . A white mottling often occurs , and in the scaleless type the iris may be  | black ; black and blue areas may be present ( as in the specimen represented in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of select breed may be regarded as the acme of beauty , grace , and elegance among goldfish , the climax of goldfish culture , satisfying all the requirements of fastidious amateurs and the general public . The late distinguished Professor K. Mitsukuri , of the Imperial Tokyo University , an authority on the goldfish of his native land , used to liken a high-grade Ryukin of rich coloration , swimming leisurely in the midst of its long , flowing , graceful drapery , to a Japanese court lady of olden times , dressed in a long , sumptuous robe and moving with sedate grace and dignity . VEILTAIL GOLDFISH ( For illustrations see Color Plates VI and VII ) The Veiltail , or Broadtail , is a refinement and improvement of the Fringetail . It came into existence in America less than twenty years ago and proved very popular among certain fanciers , who gave it precedence over the Swallowtail form and confined their attentions to it . The shape of body and excessive fin development are as in the Fringetail . The dorsal fin is high , stands very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The exuberant caudal fin hangs in regular lines and folds . Both scaled  | and scaleless forms occur . The colors are as in the Fringetail . NYMPH GOLDFISH ( For illustrations see Color Plates I and V ) Under the fanciful name of Nymph , American goldfish fanciers recognize an attractive variety which is essentially a sport of the Fringetail . It is a Fringetail which has failed to develop the complete characters of that variety and has partly reverted to the form of the more primitive fish from which the Fringetail was developed . The Nymph , however , may be produced deliberately by crossing a Fringetail and a Comet . The essential feature of the Nymph is a single caudal fin , along with which go a short , deep , thick body ; a high , erect dorsal fin ; long , pendent pectorals and ventrals ; and a single anal , together with the beautiful coloration of the Fringetail . The tail fin is like that of the Comet ? that is , non-drooping , deeply forked , and fully as long as the head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the variety makes an attractive addition to an aquarium . FANTAIL GOLDFISH ( For illustration see Color Plate VIII ) The Fantail Goldfish is the commonest and least expensive of the fancy goldfish bred in the United States . Being hardy and comparatively easy to raise , and having an attractive shape and beautiful coloration , it is in great demand for stocking house aquaria , fountains , and pools . The length of body ranges from moderate to short , without exhibiting the distortion of the caudal peduncle or the abrupt spinal curvature at the base of the tail that so many of the short-bodied forms have . The body is always fully scaled , the eye is small , the dorsal fin is high and erect , the anal fin is double , and the broad but not very long caudal fin is separated vertically into two distinct parts , which never droop , but extend straight backward and may be deeply forked . The Fantail Goldfish resembles the Fringetail , but its caudal fin is never longer than the fish itself and never falls into graceful folds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brilliant colors as the Fringetail and is a lively aquarium fish . VEILTAIL OR BROADTAIL TELESCOPE GOLDFISH ( For illustrations see Color Plates II and III ) On the Veiltail Telescope was developed the Veiltail type of the Fringetail . The double caudal fin is very broad and of most delicate filmy texture , the folds are regular , and the free edge is slightly curved . Both scaled and scaleless forms of Veiltail  | Telescopes occur and present an interesting combination of Japanese , Chinese , and American bred characters . American fanciers , crossing the Japanese Scaled Fringetail with the Chinese Scaleless Telescope , have produced varieties which by some persons are considered the crowning achievement of goldfish culture in the United States . They are distinctive and have become among the most important of the fancy breeds cultivated in this country . From the Japanese fish there have been retained in the American varieties the short , deep body , and long , broad , drooping , double tail , while from the Chinese parent stock have come the peculiar protruding eyes and calico colors . Scaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these two forms , with their characteristic shape of body , eyes , and fins , have now become fully established . The Veiltail Telescopes , of both scaled and scaleless types , may have a red body with varying amounts of white or silver . The attention of fanciers , however , is usually focused on the production of the scaleless forms of calico colors in fantastic pattern , Blotches or spots of irregular size and shape , in shades of lavender , blue , red , yellow , and brown , together with black and gray , may be scattered all over the body , and small red and black spots may occur on the white fins . As in other varieties in which there is a strain of the Chinese Calico Telescope , American fanciers strive for fish of uniform blue color ? one of the rarest and most valuable of goldfishes . CHINESE TELESCOPE GOLDFISH ( For illustrations see Color Plates II and VI ) The examples represented in the two color plates are among the simplest types of the various kinds of Telescope Goldfish raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people is not wholly because of the abnormal development of their eyes , but may rather be in spite of it and because of other features which offset the monstrosity . The whole Telescope breed of goldfish is characterized by an elongation of the eyeballs in the direction of the optic axis , with the result that the eyes project or protrude either laterally or forward beyond the surface of the head , the degree of protrusion and the shape of the eyeballs being variable . Whereas in normally developed goldfish the cornea covers the entire exposed portion of the eyeball , in the monstrosities developed by the Chinese the cornea occupies only a small part of the exposed eyeball . The peculiarity of the eyes does not show in very young fish and may not develop for several years , although it usually appears in from three to six months . Sometimes only one eye protrudes , the other being normal . In this variety , both distinctly scaled and transparently scaled forms occur , and the body shape , fin development , and coloration have quite a range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back is broad , the head is short , the large eye encroaches on the snout , and may even project as far forward as the end of it , and the size of the fins is moderate . The dorsal fin is  | rather high and the caudal is double and nondrooping . The color of individual fish may be red , white , or both , but the most striking and most desirable coloration for this variety is the combination of various shades in irregular blotches , which gives rise to a type having the distinctive name of Calico Goldfish . The Calico fish frequently shows colors that stamp it with rare beauty ; striking combinations of black , white , purple , yellow , orange , red , and gold occur ; the fins may be black , red , white , or redspotted ; and the eyes may be white , black , or red . With the further development of the caudal and other fins , the variety of early-style Chinese Telescope here illustrated passes into the Fringetail or Veiltail Telescope . CELESTIAL TELESCOPE GOLDFISH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who see the Celestial Telescope for the first time are likely , from its grotesque appearance , correctly to assign to it a Chinese origin . It is a Telescope whose eyes have departed still further from the normal and have turned heavenward . The variety has been known in America for many years and the name Celestial was first given to it by American fanciers . The distinctive eye characters develop originally as a lateral protrusion , as if the fish were to be a plain Telescope ; later the eyeballs , which are usually spherical , gradually turn upward and assume a permanent star-gazing position . Other features of this variety are a short , rounded , well-scaled body ; a short head with much abbreviated snout ; no dorsal fin ; a double caudal fin with the lateral lobes widely spread ; and a variable coloration . The example herewith depicted , from a goldfish-breeding establishment in Philadelphia , is of an iridescent golden-red color . The Celestials often swim obliquely , with the head upward , and their movements are slow and labored . Their vision is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most difficult of all goldfish to keep and rear . VEILTAIL MOOR TELESCOPE GOLDFISH ( For illustration see Color Plate VIII ) One of the rarest , most highly prized , and most striking of all goldfish bred in America is the form known among fanciers as the Veiltail Moor Telescope , or Veiltail Black Telescope . Black areas often occur in the skin of many kinds of goldfish in combination with red and white , and afford a pleasing variety and contrast , although fish so marked are not ordinarily highly esteemed by fanciers ; but when the black pigment covers the entire body and fins with an intense , uniform , rich velvety sheen , and when this is accompanied by the shape of body and the development of  | fins and eyes that characterize the popular Veiltail or Fringetail Telescopes , there is presented a truly wonderful type that would be a center of attraction in any aquarium . Even the iris and the exposed part of the eyeball are sometimes black , although the median line of the belly is blue-gray or golden . In this form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antithesis of albinism . In pure breeds , the blackness is permanent ; but many fishes that are originally " Moors " eventually lose their black pigment and become golden . It is said to be the experience of fanciers that the largest percentage of blacks may not appear in the progeny of two black parents , but may result from the mating of a black fish with a deep-red one . The Moors are always conspicuously scaled , and in the less perfect , but nevertheless very attractive , examples the margin of scales of the abdomen may be golden or bronze . It is noteworthy that the pure black goldfish always has " telescopic " eyes . Efforts to produce a black fish of other varieties have failed . JAPANESE LIONHEAD GOLDFISH ( For illustration see Color Plate III ) The extraordinary degree to which the production of goldfish varieties may be carried in the hands of skillful cultivators is well shown in the case of the Japanese Lionhead . In certain respects it is held by some fanciers to represent the highest perfection of the gentle art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one 's conception of beauty than to one 's ideas of the grotesque or bizarre . This variety , which has been cultivated in Japan for many years , has been known in the United States for at least thirty years , but has never been produced on an extensive scale . Among American fanciers the fish is usually called the Japanese Lionhead , but various other names have from time to time been applied to it , such as Japanese Hooded Goldfish , Hooded Globe , Buffalohead , and Korean Goldfish . The last name , used also in Japan , is suggestive of the variety 's possible origin or may be an allusion to its surmised route from China to Japan . Other names employed in Japan , which have become more or less familiar to Americans , are Shishigashira ( Lionhead ) , Maruko ( Round Fish ) , and Ranchu ( Holland Worm ) . Inasmuch as the name Lionhead may appropriately be given to . at least three varieties , a more distinctive designation is desirable , and Ranchu is suggested . The Japanese Lionhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth and breadth of body , by its broad , short head , almost completely covered by a wartlike growth , by the absence of a dorsal fin , and by its moderately developed double caudal fin , with the lower lobes having a tendency to spread horizontally . The general shape of the body is nearly globular and the outline of a median crosssection would be an almost perfect circle . The thickening of the skin of the head , owing to the enlargement of the papilla ; and the proliferation of the epithelial cells , amounts virtually to a benign tumor . The manner in which the growth projects beyond the general outline of the fish is shown  | in the upper figure , and the grotesque appearance that is often produced is well illustrated in the lower , front-view figure , in which it is difficult to recognize a fish 's physiognomy . The growth may encroach on the eyes to such an extent as to affect vision , while respiration may be impaired by interference with the movements of the gill covers and with the passage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lionhead are red , golden , and pearly white in varying proportions ; the entire body and fins may be red and the head bright-red , pink , creamy , or white ; the body may be white and the fins and head red ; the back and sides may be white , with regularly placed single scales of bright red , and the head pink ; or the body and fins may be variegated red and white . The swimming movements of the Lionhead are far from graceful . The globular form and the absence of the dorsal fin impair the swimming powers and diminish the ability of the fish to maintain an equilibrium ; examples sometimes met with are unable to keep in a normal position and regularly swim on the back or vertically with the head downward . The Lionhead , when full-sized , is about six inches long , including the caudal fin , and may reach a length of seven or eight inches . The peculiar excrescence on the head appears when the fish is two years old and continues to grow as the age increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its remarkable features make it a favorable subject for the attention of amateurs . It has been recorded that in the early years of its introduction in America amateurs were sometimes known to pay for fine examples " twenty times their weight in gold . " A variety of the Japanese Lionhead obtained by crossing that form with the Dutch Lionhead was first produced in Japan about 1897 . It has the general characteristics of the Japanese Lionhead as regards shape of body , absence of dorsal fin , and wartlike growth on the head , but all the other fins are longer and the double caudal is as long as , or longer than , the body and head and has the beautiful soft , wavy character of the Fringetail . This variety , known among the Japanese as the Shukin , may he called the Fringetail Lionhead or Longtail Lionhead . ORANDA ? DUTCH LIONHEAD GOLDFISH ( For illustration see Color Plate 17 ) By the crossing of the Fringetail and the Lionhead , there was produced in Japan about 1840 a singularly striking variety of goldfish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was applied . It never had any connection with Holland or the Dutch , but was so called because of the Japanese habit of ascribing to that source , or designating in that way , almost every new or strange object . The introduction of this form into the United States was accomplished many years ago , and at Philadelphia and elsewhere it has been successfully bred . The name most commonly used in the United States is Oranda . The characters of both parents are well developed in the Oranda . From the Fringetail has been derived the beautiful elongate fins , with the dorsal conspicuously high and the caudal broad and gracefully flowing ; the caudal , which is double , may equal or exceed the length of the fish proper . From the Lionhead has come the warty mass which may cover the entire top and sides of the head or form a cap above and behind the eyes . The color of the Oranda may be plain or may show a wide range of variegation . A common type is a body white or silvery-white and red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vermilion , orange-red , or variegated . The Oranda is one of the largest of the goldfishes . When the variety first appeared , its length was only from 2 to 3 inches , but under the influence of cultivation it normally reaches a body length of 4 to 5 inches , with the caudal fin of the same length . The longest examples may have both the body and the tail fin more than 6 inches long . SHUBUNKIN ? CALICO GOLDFISH ( For illustration see Color Plate VII ) The Shubunkin almost belies the tame of goldfish , and many examples are entitled to be so called only because of their ancestry . It came into existence as recently as 19co , and was the result of a deliberate attempt in Japan to produce a fish of simple form , but multivariegated , like some of the Chinese Demekins ( see text , page 382 ) . To this end , Demekins with black dapples on a vermilion or purplish background were mated with W akins blotched with red , black , bluish , and white . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters was interbred . The variety was finally established and some years later was introduced into the United States , bringing with it the Japanese name of Shubunkin , a reasonably close translation of which would be Calico Goldfish . The principal characters of this variety are a rather elongated , compressed body ; transparent scales ; long , wavy dorsal fin ; single anal and caudal fins , the latter deeply forked ; and a highly variegated coloration of body and fins . The ground colors may be a mottling of red , yellow , blue , and purple , in variable proportions , with spots of black , white , red , brown , blue , purple , yellow , or other shades . Occasionally the Japanese have produced a fish with a uniform purple color , quite unknown in either of the parent stocks . The original Shubunkins imported into the United States are said to have had comparatively small fins . American goldfish fanciers have apparently improved their original strain by producing a race with somewhat longer fins . The Shubunkin , which attains a body length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pond fish and is hardy . It offers an opportunity to amateurs to develop still further color phases and combinations within its own variety and to implant its colors on other varieties .
