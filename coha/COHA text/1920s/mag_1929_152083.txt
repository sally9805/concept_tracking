Six years ago , Rev. Sturges Allen , then 73 , Father of the Order of the Holy Cross ( strict Episcopal Monastic Order at West Park , N. Y. ) asked permission of the then Bishop of Liberia , Rt . Rev. Walter Overs , to join the Liberian mission . Because of Father Allen 's age , Bishop Overs refused . <P> Said Father Allen : " One day you and I will stand before the judgment seat of God . Then the Lord will say to me , ' Father Allen , did I not call you to go to Africa ? ' I shall answer , ' Yes . Lord . ' Then he will say , ' Why did you not go ? ' I shall answer , ' There stands the Bishop . Ask him . ' " <P> Father Allen went . He said he would rather live only six months more , usefully , in Africa , than ten years more in the U. S. , where " a priest 70 years old is not wanted much . " Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 79 , in the mission of Bolahun . Liberia , whither his Lord had called him .
