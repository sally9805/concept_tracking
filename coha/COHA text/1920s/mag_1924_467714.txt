A YOUNG man went North from an old Southern town some years ago , to learn how to be a surgeon . He found his way into one of our great Middle-Western universities , and before two years had passed his teachers knew that he had chosen his profession wisely , and that he would be one surgeon in a thousand . His brain was like a camera : it took and kept pictures of every aspect of human anatomy , so that his eye turned on a human body seemed to function like a Roentgen lamp . He had nerves which controlled his fingers with the nice sureness of steel machinery . He had that fine balance between utmost caution and seemingly reckless daring which is the fundamental essential of every great surgeon ; and among his other qualifications and possessions he had a conscience . And his conscience got him into trouble . I sat with a great surgeon not many weeks ago who had been a teacher of this boy , and he told me the boy 's story up to date . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to have a good ending . But up to now it goes something like this , as the surgeon-teacher told it to me in his office , between patients . " He was one of the best students in surgery that I ever had . I am sure he will make a great surgeon some day . It was not at all difficult for him to find a position in a hospital as soon as he had graduated . We were able to give him the highest recommendations . " He went off to a finely equipped new hospital and went to work . We got the very best reports of him and what he was doing . Then suddenly he resigned from the staff of hospital surgeons there . He came to me to make an explanation . As near as I can remember it , this is what lie said to me : " ' I could n't stay in that place . I suppose I had too much conscience . They 'd call you upstairs to the operating room and tell you to perform an operation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have never seen and about whom you knew nothing . You 'd have to take the diagnosis of some physician at its face value , without learning for yourself whether it was right or wrong , and cut away , in copy-book style , whether the patient needed an operation or not . I could n't stand it . I ca n't be that kind of a surgeon . ' " I knew just exactly what the young man meant . He was the kind of a boy who could n't stand that sort of thing . I did n't tell him at that moment whether I thought he had done right or wrong , but I said to him , " ' Well , now what are you going to do ? ' " I 'm going to pack up and go back-to my home in the South where I know the folks I 'll be operating on and I 'll know whether they need operations or not . ' " And he 's gone , too , God bless him , " added the great surgeon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I give this story , taken at first-hand , to introduce the assertion that you and I , our wives and our children , are constantly facing the risk of undergoing unnecessary surgical operations . There are hospitals where such things happen : too many of them . To put it coldly , it is not entirely unlikely that some day you or I or some one we love may be wheeled into an operating room , put to sleep under an anaesthetic and be helplesslysubjected to a. surgeon 's knife , at the risk of having life leave the body then and there , or being physically weakened for life , for no other motive than to put money into the pocket of a surgeon or a doctor . I realize , as I make this statement , that I seem to be indicting a great and an unspeakably helpful profession . fully understand how grave an offense I should be committing if I were recklessly to unseat the confidence of the public in the benefits of surgery . I have gone to no laymen for the affirmative answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgical operations ? " I have gone to men of the white aprons and the rubber gloves ? the surgeons themselves ; and in this article I shall give not a single instance of criticism of unnecessary operations which has not come to me directly from a member of the medical or surgical profession . In a hospital in an Eastern city , not long ago , the staff doctors noted the fact that a young surgeon , not on the hospital staff but on the courtesy list , was performing an astonishingly large number of operations for appendicitis in the hospital 's operating room . He sometimes had as many as ten patients in the wards awaiting his knife . He was called before these doctors to make an explanation . The gist of what he said was this : " MI admit that now and then I do perform an operation for appendicitis which is unnecessary . But here 's my problem : I practice among working people . These people ca n't afford togo to a hospital for two weeks or so and lose their wages , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must give them the benefit of the doubt . If the doubt points toward an operation I perform the operation and get them back to work as soon as rossible . " That was his explanation . I repeated it to an eminent surgeon , in a Western city in telling this story , and the surgeon laughed and said , " I 've heard that story over and over again . It is n't a new reason for performing unnecessary operations . " Ten years ago , let me add , the staff doctors of that hospital would , in all probability , never have noticed how many operations that young man was performing ; they would have noted perhaps that he was very busy and might have congratulated him on his excellent practice . But they would have taken no action ? ten years ago . Something has happened in surgery within the past decade which has changed all that . I shall tell about it farther on . A physician went to a surgeon in an Eastern city and said to him : " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has owed it for a long time . If I send him to you for an operation will you collect his payment in advance and add my bill to it ? " That 's a story I have from the actual experiences of a surgeon . Here 's another told me by an eminent New York specialist in surgery : " A physician sent me a patient for a ? nasal operation , which I performed . Some time later when I met this doctor he suggested that a portion of the fee I had charged might very graciously have been sent to him . " ' But never mind this time , ' he added . And then he proposed to me , in all seriousness , that he could tell his patient , who was extremely wealthy , that something was wrong with the other nostril and that an operation would be necessary . He said that ought to mean some money to him . I would not accept his offer . But his patient did have an operation performed on the other nostril , quite unnecessarily , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago surgeon the telephone interrupted a conversation we were having on unnecessary operations . " Yes ! Yes ! doctor , " answered the surgeon . " Yes , I know the lady very well . Yes , I operated on her once . No ! No ! I wo n't operate on her again . It would n't help her at all in my opinion . " A pause . " You agree with me then ? That 's fine . If she wants an operation she 'll have to find some one who does that kind of work . I 'm glad you feel as I do about it . Good-by . " Then the surgeon turned to me . " That 's an instance of what we have been talking about , " he said . " Some years ago I performed an operation on that woman . It did her a certain amount of benefit . Sometime later she came to me again , persuaded by some one that she ought to have another operation . I examined her carefully and decided that an operation would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her so . " But she went to another surgeon who performed the operation . And now she has turned up in the office of the surgeon who just telephoned to me asking him to perform a third operation . He has told me that he will refuse to do it . But she 'll be able to find sonic one , of course , who will accommodate her . Some one ought to protect that woman against herself and against a certain sort of surgeon . A third operation may weaken her for life . " ? Three surgeons sat at luncheon with this writer not many weeks ago . They were men eminent in their beneficent profession . They had declared their willingness to enlighten me about the profession of surgery and its works . " Now let So-and-So talk to you , " said the surgeon who was the host . " I Vut , . aS5. - 29brought him here to-day because he knows what he 's talking about . " " So-and-So " is not only a master of surgery but he is a great teacher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools in the country have learned the use of the knife under his instruction . And so I listened to So-and-So ? my readers will please remember that doctors and physicians are under an oath , sacred in their profession , against publicity , so that I can not use their names ? while he spoke to us both as a surgeon and as a teacher . In effect , this is what he said : " I am going to admit that there has been too much needless surgery performed . I think that unnecessary operations ought to be prevented in every possible way . You ought not to write anything in your article which will destroy the confidence of the public in the benefits of surgery ; but I believe that the truth will do far more good than harm in this respect . " You , as a layman , must get the historical background of surgery , before you try to write your article . You must understand this : Before anaesthetics were used in operations surgery was uncommon and surgeons were rare . Graduates of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days . Even the ancient oath of Hippocrates provided that he as a physician would not attempt to perform an operation which belonged in the field of surgefy . " But the last half century in the United States has changed the situation . The introduction of anaesthetics has made operations easier for the operator as well as for the subject . What used to be a severe test of the operator 's nerves became a fairly easy task . . " Physicians here and there with the aid of anwstheties began to attempt operations . They found themselves successful . Men with great courage and daring began to gain reputations as surgeons , and they became good ones . It was not long before most doctors became willing to attempt small operations with anaesthetics as their aid . " And then came a time when the medical profession began to rely too much on the knife . The temptation to do this was very great . Very often in the practice of medicine beneficial results , though sure , are slow and indefinite , and only gradually discernible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Definite surgery as against indefinite medical treatment became a grave temptation to many physicians . The patient seemed to feel after an operation that he had experienced concrete results of some sort . " What 's more , I must admit that surgery was oftentimes more remunerative than medicine . It requires less time in the ease of each patient , and the patient expects to pay a considerable fee for an operation . " There was a financial temptation in surgery which was hard for many men to resist . Men in medicine and surgery are only human . As a doctor 's family grew his expenses increased . He fell in time the need for more money , a better home , and perhaps a more imposing office . Fees for surgery met this need only too readily . " All the temptations led toward surgery . Of course , too , many unnecessary operations were performed . Any graduate of a. medical school , if he had the nerve , could perform operations , no matter what the results . There was no one to check up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old-fashioned medical-school diploma -- and it exists almost everywhere to-daypermitted him to practice medicine and surgery , though he had had no training in surgery of any sort . " That was a transitional stage in surgery , based on the discovery of anresthetics . We have been in this stage for half a century and we are still in it , though we are emerging from it . " No control of the surgeon ; no checking up on him . The lack of these onlyincreased the temptation toward operations . We talked back and forth across the table about this . " There has been no check-up on the surgeon , " said one . " If he discovered , on making an opening with his knife , that his diagnosis had been wrong there was no one but himself to know that a mistake bad been made . If he had performed an unnecessary operation there was no one to call him to account . It is n't a good thing for a man in any profession or in any business to have so much leeway as that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been certain great surgeons who have insisted that surgeons must be brought under control and accountability like men in other professions . The men who sat at lunch with me that day are among them . One of the most severe critics of surgery is Dr. E. A. Codman of Boston . " Do you dare to show your end-results ? " Dr. Codman once demanded of his fellow surgeons . He became famed among them for that query . In the parlance of surgery the term " end-results " means nothing more or less than what it indicates ? the tissue or member or part or growth which has been removed from the subject 's person by the surgeon 's knife . " Do you dare to show what you have cut away and disclose the results of your Operations ? " That was the effect of Dr. Codman 's question . He continually demanded that some way he devised whereby " one could have surgical accounting as well as any other kind of accounting . " He , with other great surgeons , was against the man who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings and then not be held responsible or accountable to other men than himself , or to the patient , for the results . Let us put the criticism of Dr. Cod-man and other critical surgeons into terms easily understood by the layman . Let us see the surgeon through the eyes of surgeons . A surgeon to other surgeons is a man who has studied medicine and human anatomy and who has gained experience in the use of the knife . He is like any other man ? human , subject to temptation , greed , vanity , praise , or criticism . He is as likely to be misplaced in his profession as other men sometimes are in their professions . He is liable to error , and the ghastly fact is that his error may cost human life . More than that , these men know that his greed may cost human life ; his vanity may cost human life ; his love of praise or fear of criticism may cost human life . Many surgeons know that in their profession there are men who ought not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surgeons have been asking themselves the past dozen years what was to be done ? No help could come from the layman ; from you or me , and this for a very good reason . In your mind and mine there is a faith in doctors and surgeons which borders on the ancient belief in priest-craft ; we are not educated up to doctors and surgeons . These surgeons who wanted the great profession cleaned up knew they could not depend on us . You and I , secretly , surgeons tell me , really like to have operations performed on us . An operation comes into our humdrum lives like a great adventure ; it is our way of skirting death and proving to ourselves the preciousness of living . One of the early adventures of new-rich Americans is to undergo an operation . All surgeons know this . The leading surgeons of our great cities are bombarded with requests to perform expensive operations . " Let an American of a certain class suddenly become very rich and he immediately does three things : Buys a limousine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an operation performed on himself or on her by the most famous surgeon in his community , " a rugged old surgeon told me not long ago . " Not a day goes by that most big surgeons do not have to refuse at least one invitation to take some new-rich person through the adventure of the operating room . " No . With you and me blindly trusting our loved ones to any surgeon who came along , and with you and me , when we had the financial means , even insisting on having our persons rut into , the surgeons who saw the need of cleaning up their profession could not depend a decade ago upon you and me to help them in their great task . It 's different to-day ? as a result of the mighty movement that is under way ; surgeons are talking to mass meetings of citizens in various cities and asking their help ? but I shall tell of this later . To-day , as a result of the new movement of the past half-dozen years , there is no profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery ; among its methods of purging itself it has inaugurated what amounts to a system of surveillance extending throughout the land . The surgeon who cuts you or me today is not an independent agent who can hide from his fellows , as well as from his helpless trusting patient , the kinks in his mind or in his character . He is under a white light . He is no longer protected by your or my willingness to look on him as almost a superman . And this is how the change is coming about : In the old days ? and that is not more than a dozen years ago ? the procedure of an operation was something like this : Your physician agreed with you that something was the matter with you inside , and that something ought to be done about it . He made his diagnosis as best he could , summoning all his own knowledge to his aid , and then , perhaps , after consultation with other physicians , suggested an operation . Perhaps he told you he would perform the operation himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were taken off to a hospital and please note that oper-ations are always performed at hospitals ? put in condition for the adventure , taken to the operating room , put to sleep , and came through the ordeal very well , perhaps with great benefit to yourself . You recovered , paid the bill , and felt grateful to everyone concerned . You left the hospital , thanking everybody . You will remember the hospital and the good people in it , the orderlies , ward doctors , nurses and all , for the rest of your life . But ? and herein lies all the evils of the old system of surgery ? the hospital forgot you . We must now speak of very intimate matters . Some of you ? a portion of your anatomy ? was left at that hospital . " Tissue , " as the surgeons call it , remained in the operating room after you were wheeled out . It might have been an appendix . It was once the fashion for appendicitis patients to ask to have the removed appendix presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was considered a good joke both by the hospital and by the patient . The theory was that what had been cut from you belonged to you . If the patient did n't want what he had lost , the tissue was thrown away or burned perhaps , in the hospital furnace by the janitor . And now let me give a scene in the operating room of a hospital working under the new standards . You would not be able to secure from this hospital any portion of yourself which the surgeon removes . What 's cut away in that hospital goes to a laboratory , as property of the hospital . I 'll let the surgeon who performed the operation tell it as he told it to me . If 1 gave his name you would instantly recognize it , so great is his fame . " A new hospital was opening in the town where I was born . My mother had helped in the community task of collecting the funds and building it , and I was asked to come back home and perform the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud , but I was prouder of the town and what it had done when I saw that operating room . It was perfectly fitted . " But there was an extra person in that room during that operation ? a pathologist . Opening right off the operating room , there was a splendid laboratory , fitted with everything that a pathological laboratory could need . " The operation was for the removal of a tumor . The first piece of tumor tissue that I cut away was taken from my hand by this pathologist and , within a. very few minutes , while I was stilt working , the pathologist came back to me with that piece of tissue frozen so that I could have handled it and examined it under a microscope before the operation was completed . " A surgeon sometimes uses more than his eyesight to see what he 's doing . Here at my hand , was microscopic sight , laboratory sight . I had more than my knives as tools in that operation ; the laboratory and all its implements were added to my instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life , " he concluded smiling . Very frequently to-day , in the new operation , there is an additional person present beside the pathologist . Standing sheathed in white like the nurses and the surgeon , is a stenographer ! The operating room is not the silent place it used to he . ' The surgeon is speaking as he ruts . He is telling what he is doing ! This is because : " The day when an individual doctor could do as he might he prompted to do and take a patient to operation without careful , considerate diagnosis and operate as he pleased with closed doors , is practically gone . It exists here and there . " I use the words of the president of a great association of more than six hundred hospitals to illustrate my point . The operating room , in this great . clean-up , is no longer a secret place . You or 1 , lying there asleep , with our lives in the hands of a man with a knife and with license to cut as he pleases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , for a surgeon to talk as he works . But I quote the superintendent of a great hospital in Philadelphia in describing how surgeons may tell their story : " Some operators can dictate during the operation itself . Some of our very best surgeons do . Others leave it until after the operation is over . The dictation is sometimes made into a dietaphone which does not require anybody 's time and can be taken off at any time . " Methods of dictation may differ , but means whereby a surgeon may tell the story of what he is doing will be at his right . hand in the new hospital . " I believe , " says a leading surgeon of Portland , Oregon , " that the hospital ought to furnish a stenographer to take the record of the operation and place it on the history , and then allow the surgeon to O.K. it . " However it is done , the surgeon 's own description of every operation he performs in a hospital must become part of that hospital 's record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital as part of its record ; the surgeon must give his story of why and how he took that tissue from us . The new hospital of to-day does not forget us and our case , as the old one did . And then what is done with this record ? Let me give a recent scene in a world-famous surgical hospital . It is Wednesday evening . Every surgeon in the hospital is present in a great room , seated before a cinema screen ; interns and students are present . On the screen is thrown the name of a patient who died on the operating table a few days previously . " Dr. So-and-So , " calls the chief of staff , " you performed this operation . Will you kindly tell us about it ? " And the surgeon under whose knife a human life passed out arises and gives the best explanation he possibly can for the misadventure . In that hospital ? and in several hundreds of other hospitals in the United States and Canada in this new day of surgery ? surgeons must explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell why they performed the operation and , if they have committed an error , they must explain that ? if they can . The regular meeting of hospital staffs in which " tissue " and the surgeon 's own story of the operation , as well as all evil results are discussed and criticized , is gradually becoming mandatory in hospitals of the country . These conferences are as necessary , if the surgeons are to purge themselves and their profession of its old evils , as sterilization in the operating room . Indeed , these meetings are sterilization . Not long ago in a New York hospital a surgeon " lost a ease . " He was asked to appear at the next staff conference and explain . He did not appear . The next day lie received a signed statement from the superintendent , ? telling him that if he would not obey the rules of the hospital laid down for such eases , his resignation would be accepted . He came , though he was one of the great and busy surgeons of the town . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staff who has operated on a patient who has died subsequently , should not stand up frankly , " says an eminent surgeon , of Brooklyn , " to answer any questions that any member of the staff may ask him as to why he did this thing or why he did not do it . In my hospital we go farther than that . We have a little reading stand on the platform with a light overhead so that it casts its effulgence right over him . " My story has halted and jerked , I know . This is because I have been trying to cram into a few thousand words the story of one of the most dramatic changes and improvements in a profession which our country has ever known . And I have tried to tell it in the words of the surgeons themselves . How has this change come about ? How has it been accomplished ? In the first place the surgeons who lead in the great movement were men with great vision . They saw these things : The surgeon exists for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surgeon . Unnecessary operations , even when performed with a high order of technical ability , are the bane of present-day surgery . Surgery must be sterilized morally . Physicians were splitting fees with surgeons . Doctors were sending their patients to surgeons for operations and were receiving money back , secretly , from the surgeon . " The impression gained by our hospital visitors " ? this is from a statement made to a gathering of several hundred American and Canadian surgeons , by an expert hospital investigator ? " is that the practice of fee-division is present to some extent in nearly every state and province , even though it may be practically unknown in some sections . " How to control surgeons became the glowing question among doctors and surgeons . For many years this question remained unanswered and surgery continued as unsterile as a diphtheria culture . And then some one got this idea : Surgeons operate in hospitals . The place to control surgeons is in the hospital . Let the surgeon-controlled hospital control surgeons . And it is by this method that the control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A dozen years ago in Boston at a meeting of surgeons it was suggested that there were two kinds of hospitals in the United States : one kind which was a sort of boarding house for ill people , with a private room in which a surgeon could do to his patients whatever he pleased ; a second kind which accepted the responsibility for its patients and their welfare and tried to keep track of whether it as an institution was helping or hurting people . It is the second kind of hospital that is coming to the front in the United States to-day . The first kind is being driven out of existence just as rapidly as a great army of surgeons and physicians can persuade the public that it must go . It is true that in the great cities perhaps in every city of any size ? there are hospitals where a surgeon may secretly have his way with a patient 's health and life and pocketbook , but today there is a way ? and I shall describe it farther along ? by which you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The name of Dr. Franklin H. Martin of Chicago must stand out above all others in this story of the clean-up of American surgery . Ten years ago at his suggestion , five hundred surgeons met in the city of Washington to discuss the sterilization of surgery . Dr. Martin is an eminent surgeon and editor of a surgical magazine . At that time the surgeons formed themselves into an organization which they named " The American College of Surgeons . " Think of the name of any famous surgeon in this country ; it will be on the membership list . To-day this organization has 6 , Q150 members , each known as a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons . How many members the College might . have no one can tell exactly . There is a hazy No-Man 's land between surgeons and physicians , and applications for membership are treated with the severest scrutiny . There are 140,000 doctors , including surgeons , in the United States . No matter where you hive , gentle reader ? and possible operating-room subject ? there arc surgeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Surgeons and there are other surgeons who are seeking to become members . In every state in the Union and in every province in Canada , as well as in every state in South America , there are credential committees of the College , made up , of course , of surgeons . The members of these local credential committees act with the greatest care . If your surgeon wants to join the College he must send to its headquarters in Chicago a written record of one hundred operations ? fifty major and fifty minor . Rased on these records , his technical skill is passed upon , and then the opinions of the local credentials committee from his district are sought . It is a rough road to go , this road into the American College of Surgeons . When the College was two years old ? that was in 1915 ? it turned its attention to hospitals ? for the purpose , as we have seen , of controlling surgeons and surgery . It set standards for hospitals . In your community there are hospitals that have met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have not It is easy to ascertain the standard hospital , as I shall show . At the close of the year 1923 in the United States and Canada , among the 1,786 hospitals which have 50 beds or more , 1,176 ? or 65.9 per cent areon the approved list of the American College of Surgeons . The remaining 34.1 per cent are not on this list , but are striving to get there . Some but not all of them will succeed . Among the small hospitals ? those with from 50 to 100 beds-46,7 per cent are on the list . The remaining 53.3 per cent are not ? and many of them , being places for the secret evils of surgery , will never get there . Five things a hospital must do to meet the " minimum standard " of the American College of Surgeons . The first . is to agree that all physicians and surgeons -. who practice in the hos.pital be considered , so far as obeying rules are concerned , as members of the staff . Only those who thus subscribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being willing to obey hospital rules and describe their operations at staff meetings are concerned , shall be allOwed to practice hi the hospital . In the old days doctors aid surgeons used to have control over a hospital ; under this new rule the hospital has control over doctors and surgeons . The second is that , for one thing , there shall he no fee-splitting . ? The third is that there he staff meetings , and that the staff and all physicians practicing in the hospital shall review and analyze hospital work . The fourth is that accurate records , consisting of the complete history of every case , together with autopsy find , ings when necessary , be kept in accessible manner . The fifth is that . there be a laboratory , with full scientific service , in charge of trained technicians . That 's all ? those five points . And yet their adoption kills the old boarding-house hospital , which most of our hospitals were , not many years ago , and makes the hospital itself responsible for everything that goes on within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , philanthropic , or public hospitals . When , as a layman reporter , I analyze what the surgeons have done within the past ten years to ventilate surgery , I find that what they have had to strike at hardest among themselves was fee-splitting . Officially , the College of Surgeons cuts relentlessly into this tumor of medical practice . The most critical layman could not . set the facts of fee-splitting before the public any more clearly than does this extract from an official bulletin ; The division of fees , or fee-splitting , is the buying and selling of patients . The practice exists in various forms , but the most usual form is as follows : A general practitioner makes a diagnosis in which surgical interference is indicated . He then refers the patient to a surgeon for operation . The surgeon operates , collects a fee.and sends to the physician one-third or one-half the fee , the transactions being unknown to the patient . Sometimes the physician collects the fee " for the surgeon " and retains his percentage . as agreed with the surgeon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient that the physician " assists the surgeon " and gives the antestbetie . In many such cases the explanation is a subterfuge for fee-splitting . A competent surgeon usually has a regular assistant and an anaesthetist with whom he is accustomed to work , and is more aide in this way to do good work than if he permits each referring doctor to assist him . Undoubtedly the physician should be paid for the study and diagnosis of a surgical case . But he should be paid directly by the patient . In the same way the surgeon should be paid directly by the patient . But the accounts of the physician and the surgeon should not be confused or rendered to the patient as a single statement . The evils of fee-splitting are , first , that it makes for incompetent surgery . The surgeon who is a party to the practice gets his cases usually not upon the basis of merit but upon the basis of the percentage of fees collected that he will give to practitioners . Please picture yourself , reader , or one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who tells you that an operation is necessary and then seeks for you not the best surgeon whom he can find but the surgeon who will give him the largest percentage of the fee you pay ? the surgeon who will give him 60 per cent. , for instance , instead of some other surgeon 's 50 . Some of the hospitals in the larger cities that have been cleaning house within the past five years discovered that sonic young surgeons , desirous of practice ? and money ? were returning to physicians who sent patients to them as high as 75 per cent of the patient 's fee . Second , ( this merciless bulletin continues ) fee-splitting makes for unnecessary surgical operations . Under the fee-splitting system surgery becomes a commercial enterprise andnot a professional service . Both the physician and the surgeon tend to make surgical diagnoses without adequate study , and the result is unnecessary surgery . Much of the unnecessary surgery of our present day is due directly to fee-splitting . Third , fee-splitting , by introducing dishonesty into medical practice , lowers the entire medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , says to his patient that he refers him to the most competent surgeon , when he knows well enough that if he , the physician . were to be operated upon lie would select another surgeon . Further , the fee-splitter usually poses before his patient as having received little or no fee for his services , when , as a matter of fact , he has received a large fee indirectly from the patient . He holds such a fee really as a theft . To cut the greed glands out of surgery has really been the first step of the College of Surgeons . The next step will be to attempt to cut out inefficiency in surgery , to define good and had surgery and fix a standard . Now that accountability of surgeons has been fixed to an extent that their daily professional doings are being recorded , it is not remotely possible that sonic day the efficiency of each man shall be gauged by a scientific scale scientifically established by the College . " Honor , honesty , and efficiency can be measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their conferences recently . It will he difficult , however , to measure surgical efficiency . " Here is a surgeon , " explains a physician , discussing this subject , " who knows that he should not have a mortality in his active practice of more than 4 per cent , and who therefore refuses to endanger his mortality record by certain operations . I do not want any man to refuse to open my abdomen because he might exceed his death rate . You have to have fearless surgery today . " And , on the other hand , the reckless experimenter with human life must he curbed . Some of the great surgeons are the most reckless . We should charge up an error of judgment or of technic or in other cases wipe that physician 's record clean from censure who operates on a patient in eTtremis . This matter of fair surgical mortality must be formulated . " The College of Surgeons may some day tell a surgeon how many patients he must not lose . You and I shall then be safer on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery within the past decade is only one more success in the era-long endeavor of medical men to keep their profession clean and purged . There is no physician in the world today who does not know the revered oath of Hippocrates. with its " With purity and holiness will I pass my life and practice my art . . . . Into whatever houses I enter I will go for the advantage of the sick and will abstain from every voluntary act of mischief and corruption . . . . While I continue to keep this oath inviolate may it be granted to me to enjoy life and the practice of my art , respected always by all men ; but should I break through and violate this oath may the reverse he my lot . " They go out into the world from the schools , young doctors , with their eyes on the stars and the sentiment of this great vow ringing in their hearts . Two thousand years and more ago that vow was taken . Another call rang out in the Middle Ages . Its vibrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chattliac , in France , in the 14th Century , set this inspiring code : " Let the surgeon be bold in all sure things and fearful in all dangerous things ; let him avoid all faulty treatment and practices . He ought to he gracious to the sick , considerate to his associates , cautious in his prognostications . Let him be modest , dignified . gentle , pitiful , and merciful ; not covetous nor an extortionist of money . But rather let his reward be according to his word , to the means of his patient , to thequality of the issue and to his own dignity . " And now comes another voice , a third oath , practically and unsentimentally worded as becomes our practical times . The twentieth century gives it to the world from the new continents of the Americans . It is the oath of the Fellows of the American College of Surgeons . It runs , simply : " Upon my honor as a gentleman , I hereby declare that I will not practice the division of fees , either directly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laymen , we may stretch ourselves out and raise our faces to the ether funnel with far more security these days than ever before . It is well to know that your hospital is on the list of those which have adopted the " minimum standard " of the American College of Surgeons . Why not ask this question before they take your clothes away from you ? indeed , before you register ? Investigators of the College of Surgeons are constantly inspecting hospitals of the country and are recommending them for favorable classification in the College as soon as they comply with the five requirements . As to your surgeon ? fellowship in the American College of Surgeons is not necessary to good and honest surgery . He may be able , though too young in practice to have gained the right to enter . The association , too , is too young to have sifted out and taken in all worthy men . Your surgeon 's application may he in that year-long process ( sometimes more ) of being granted . Or , God bless him ! he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small towns and out-of-the-way places , who fight all their lives against death and suffering with pills and knives , hot-water bottles or any other weapon that is best and handiest to bring us into the world and to keep us here as long as they can . He , this family doctor , could not belong to the American College of Surgeons because not eighty per cent of his work is surgery . If you want to measure your surgeon , measure hini by the kind of hospital he tries to send you to . That 's your sure and safe yardstick for surgeons and doctors these days . Can he secure your admission to a hospital that has adopted the " minimum standard " , of the American College of Surgeons ? If he can , he is probably all right . The hospital , under these new rules , remember , is not primarily admitting you ; it is admitting him to practice within its walls , and it has power under the " minimum standard " to call him to account . If he can not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something is wrong . " There are a hundred so-called hospitals in this city , " said a famous surgeon , " which are nothing but boarding houses . Some down-and-out woman , instead of starting a boarding house , rents an old residence in some once fashionable district , puts a lot of beds within the rooms , gets a secondhand operating table , a gas stove , an old wash boiler to boil instruments in , fits up a so-called operating room , and then starts what she calls a hospital for surgical or maternity cases . She usually charges very high prices to lure the well-to-do . God help a man or woman who gets into a place like that ! " You 'll find , usually , that when a physician or surgeon dues resort to such places he is out of caste in the good hospitals . " But a hall-mark is being put on hospitals and on surgeons too in America these days , so that you and I can keep ourselves in safe hands if we only ask the hospital whether it is under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surgeons ? and ask our surgeon whether he is admitted to practice in a " minimum-standard " hospital . In asking him this question you are only asking : " Doctor , will other doctors and surgeons ? your associates ? have an opportunity to pass on the work you are going to do on me ? " If he answers " yes , " you may know that he is a controlled surgeon . If he answers " no , " and can not explain that answer , show hire the door . There will be other surgeons round the corner in this new day of surgery ? who will not stand by the old fogy code of not taking another 's man 's case , who will help you . They will understand why you wanted to change doctors ; and they will have thousands of doctors behind them , approving their action , for they will consider it only a part of American surgery 's big clean-up . The American College of Surgeons , during the past eight years , has spent more than a third of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last five years over $819,000 has been expended to better the environment in which surgery is performed , namely , to better the hospitals . This is the money of surgeons themselves with the exception of $90,000 granted by the Carnegie Foundation . Six . thousand surgeons are now paying the expenses of the work . Medical schools are recommending their students for internship in the " minimum-standard " hospitals ; people of wealth are learning to make their contributions only to hospitals that have adopted the " minimum standard . " And now the College of Surgeons is expecting you and me ? the public ? to understand what they are trying to do . I have said that in certain towns , notably on the Pacific Coast , mass meetings have been held to inform the public of the new movement . A mass meeting may be held in your town some day . It will probably afford you an opportunity to see and hear the leading surgeons of your community . These mass meetings have seemed to be pretty drastic methods with some surgeons of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is performed on the professors of surgery themselves .
