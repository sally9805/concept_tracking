In 1655 Rembrandt van Rijn sat down to paint his own picture . Often had he done it before ; often was he to do it again . Most profound artists are introverts , seekers of their own devious mysteries . In the mirror Rembrandt studied his greenish , fur-lined cloak , his quietly folded hands . But ever and again he returned to probe his own sad eyes , perhaps hypnotized himself as people do who gaze in mirrors . He saw a man who was not intoxicated exclusively with his own painting , but who loved the work of other men and , indeed , bought so much of it that he was fast approaching bankruptcy . A great deal of this embracing , sacrificial sympathy is visible in the self-portrait . A year after it was finished Rembrandt was financially ruined . <P> In 1740 the self-portrait was bought by the English Buccleuchs for $340 . <P> Last week the Duke of Buccleuch sold it for $582,000 . <P> The buyers , Messrs . Colnaghi of London , will shortly offer it at public auction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French impressionist , scarcely paid for their own paint . When he died in 1903 , he left a studio cluttered with his own work and that of his friends ( Mary Cassatt , Monet , Manet , Seurat , Cezanne ) . Until last week these were kept as mementos by the Pissarro family . Then they sold them at auction in Paris . The total return was about $134,000 . <P> The Louvre , more and more attentive to Impressionism ( TIME , Dec. 3 ) , bought a Pissarro watercolor and a pencil portrait of Pissarro by Paul Cezanne.
