txt Although the Baldwin Locomotive Works is operating at only 30% of capacity , and with no indications of any immediate improvement of any consequence in output , the company should ; nuke a good report for the current year in view of the satisfactory operations in the first six months . The company has $8,000,000 unfilled business on its books , the largest recent order being that taken in Mexico by President Samuel M. Vauclain himself . There are inquiries pending in the equipment market and President Vauclain anticipates a steady increase in operations during the Fall and Winter . Shipments of locomotives in the first half of 1921 approximated $33,000,000 as compared with $27,000,000 in the same period of 1920 , according to figures current in the financial district . Although Baldwin does not follow the practice of sonic other corporations in issuing semiannual statements some authentic reports of earnings have crept into financial circles . Manufacturing profit in the first six months according to these reports was- slightly under $6,000,000 , while other income brought profits to roundly $6,650,000 . Depreciation and federal taxes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which after deducting the dividend on the preferred stock leaves balance of $5,050,000 which is equivalent to an annual rate of 50 ? - 4. % upon the common . Since the beginning of the war Baldwin has shown large profits , but there have always been heavy charges of various kinds which reduced the amount available for dividend distribution , and when the annual report is prepared there may be some deductions for reserves , expenses or other charges which do not appear in preliminary estimates of earnings . Baldwin 's unfilled orders have been holding around $8,000,000 for several months , although last week they were clown to $6,500.000 . President Vauclain again turned salesman and his trip to Mexico was productive of business with the prospect that additional orders may be forthcoming on a satisfactory ' basis . Due to the business depression , poor financial condition of the railroads in part due to delay of the Government in squaring accounts as well as unsettled world conditions equipment orders have been reduced , to a minimum this year . So far this year  --  Baldwin 's has only taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that amount represented an accumulation of orders taken last year and which were not shipped in 1920 . These orders being completed and shipped in 1921 helped to swell the earnings account for the first half of the year , and the greater part of the shipments and profits were made in the first three months of the year . With business coming in at the rate of only 30% of capacity and with operations running at a greater percentage it meant that Baldwins was shipping more engines than were being received in the first half of the year and in reducing orders on the books . After he had made shipments to meet urgent demands President Vauclain gradually tapered down operations which were close to capacity at the beginning of the year to around 30% where he has maintained them . In other words he is running the plant now at the same ratio that business is being booked .
