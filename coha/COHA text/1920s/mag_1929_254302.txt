A new departure in adult education was undertaken last week in Manhattan by 14 Junior Leaguers and the Parents League of New York City . Social education with a big " S " was the subject . <P> The movement began with a questionnaire which was sent to 3,000 social eligibles , male and female , mostly of the debutante and young-bond-salesman age . Some of the questions were : <P> Are you in favor of having dinners on time ? Will you arrive punctually at the hour set ? Will you get to dances on time ? If you accept a dinner invitation will you really attend ? <P> The Junior League leader of the social educators is Miss Marka ( Margaret Louise ) Truesdale of Manhattan . She has tired of eating meals grown cold by waiting for a tardy guest . And she sympathizes with young businessmen who go to parties and have to be at their offices the morning after . Said she : " Things have gone so far that it 's not pleasant . We 're not enjoying it . The young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't enjoying it . Being late came into fashion but it 's getting so that everybody comes later and later . As things are now you 're invited to an 8 o'clock dinner and sometimes it 's 10 o'clock before you sit down . Then there is a pause before you go to dance . It 's why the young business men do n't come to deb parties . They want to and we want them , but they ca n't come because they have to get up for work the next day . "
