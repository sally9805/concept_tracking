As soon as the Chemical Exposition ( see above ) closed its doors and dismantled its display , into the " palace " sped men with hammers , saws , paints , brushes , tweezers , nippers , screwdrivers , wire and tapes , to prepare new wonders for the public eye-the 18th annual Electrical and Industrial Exposition . Inklings of what was in store were issued : a device enabling housewives to cook and bake with the heat from ordinary electric light bulbs ; 40 different electric refrigerators ; 20 new electric household tools ; an endless variety of washing , ironing , cleaning machines ; an all-electric barber shop including an electrically-driven safety razor ; a " bloodless " or " radio " knife for surgeons ; photograph-transmitting radios-in all , devices numbering over 20,000 , developed since Benjamin Franklin ( fabulously ) drew current from the heavens on a kite string .
