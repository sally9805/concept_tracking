NUNS have long held and will no doubt continue to hold a very reserved nook in the public mind . Art and poetry have combined to consecrate the figure of the gentle , pale-faced woman in black habit and white hood , bowed before the crucifix " breathless in adoration . " History , in harmony with art , passes on the background of processions of pious fugitives bereaved of their convent homes by hostile governments ; or of white-robed sisters gliding noiselessly from bed to bed in wards of hospitals hastily erected to care for wounded soldiers . It was inevitable that some corrective to the over-idealized figure should in time be administered , and " Convent Girl " supplies the needed corrective in a deft and sprightly way . Helene Mullins tells of her contacts with nuns during her school years . She draws skilfully five types of nuns , and without either squeamishness or unfairness describes their idiosyncrasies . The five are Clement , the somewhat cattish saint , Martha , human but unspiritual ; Juliana the garrulous , Thecla the pallid and colorless ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thecla the girl develops a " crush . " " From that hour I lived but for glimpses of her , diligently setting myself to learn , without too openly inquiring , her occupations and her habits , so that I might guess at what moments and in what places I should be most likely to see her . " Further , she searches for knowledge of the real Saint Thecla in a " Lives of Saints " which by strategy she borrows from Clement , but Clement cleverly finds out what " Life " she has read and learns her romantic secret " So ! Saint Thecla 1 That 's how it is ! " ' " ' By recounting these and other episodes and escapades that upset the harmony of convent school life , Miss Mullins succeeds in giving a realistic , if slightly disturbing , picture of the curious relation which exists between the Catholic girl and her Alma Mater ; but she confines herself to the psychology of that situation and refrains from fundamental criticisms of any kind . Her style is not fully emancipated from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their classes , but her gifts as an artist are unmistakable and her insight into character is distinctly shrewd . While not professedly attempting to enhance the prestige of convent-schools ; she implicitly adds her testimony to the fact that nuns put high ideals before their pupils . " Convent Girl " is daring , independent , and fair , and is certain to interest enormously all who have had to tread the highly polished , slippery floors of convent parlors . E. BOYD BARRETT A Curious Background The Background of the Russian Revolution . By Alexander Meyendorff . Henry Holt and Company . $2.50 . THE author of " The Background of the Russian Revolution " is described on the jacket of his book as a Russian baron , a former vice-president of the Imperial Duma , and at present attached as reader in Russian institutions and economics to the University of London . His book consists of three short essays , delivered last year as the Colver lectures at Brown University . The text is generously interlarded with American references and comparisons . These afford the American reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author . In one of these references , by a bit of unconscious perversion , the author attempts to make Dr. Charles A. Beard his authority for listing Samuel Adams , Thomas Paine , Patrick Henry , and Jefferson as among the principal framers of the American Constitution . Dr. Beard , of course , was in process of making the point that none of these four revolutionary leaders attended the constitutional convention or had anything to do with the framing . Again , the author quotes a statement before the State legislature , by Governor Morley of Colorado , on the limitations of state government as opposed to the federal power , and uses this as a text for some ponderous theorizing on the natural restrictions of the state . These two grotesqueries are not untypical . They are all the more amazing because in his preface the author assures us that his manuscript was edited by a number of reputable American scholars . One must assume that these scholars and the auditors at the Colver lectures were alike persons of an uncommonly charitable nature . Mr. Meyendorff 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysticisms , buttressed by hundreds of quotations from major and minor prophets including Voltaire , Calvin Coolidge , and Dr. Will Durant . Each essay is overbalanced by a mass of notes , usually quite irrelevant and trivial , which run to twice the length of the text proper . It is in the notes that the author gives himself free rein . He resurrects the long discredited Sisson documents to prove that Lenin was merely a Mongolian agent of the German Kaiser . He also states that the Czarist regime piled up such a generous surplus that for twelve years , having produced nothing under the Soviet power , the country " has maintained itself exclusively on the accumulated wealth of the old regime . " Mr. Meyendorff 's main thesis is simple . Czardoro was a European , in other words a civilizing , influence in Russia . It was a bit too advanced for the Eurasian culture . It had installed popular representation through the Imperial Duma and was speedily transferring all the land to the peasants . Under the circumstances the revolutionary upheaval was a puzzle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady Europeanization . They reverted to " Eurasianism " and followed the mongol-faced Lenin . In support of this airy theory the author deigns to submit no facts . He ignores the reality that if the government had become representative the population evidently was unaware of it . He leaps delicately over the reality that if the land was rapidly passing to those who tilled it the mujik was too stupid to realize it , possibly because before his eyes the greater part of it was still held by the crown , the church , and the larger owners ; and he was conscious of paying for his tiny strips upwards of $200,000,000 yearly to absentee landlords The author is not concerned with the immediate causal actuality that the distributive system had ceased to function and the masses in the cities were starving . He is equally unconcerned over the vulgar fact that the masses in the army , having seen some 7,000,000 of their comrades swallowed up in the shambles under the compulsion of titled nincompoops , were determined to cry quits and go home . The intellectual relics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their pens betray them The dispassionate reader is forced to marvel that seemingly educated men could be so ignorant of their own country , or indeed of the things of this world . The only thing their pages clarify is the reason why they have become emigres . HAROLD KELLOCK Poetry Briefs The Profession of Poetry and Other Lectures By H. W Gar-rod . Oxford University Press . $4.50 . Most of these lectures were delivered at Oxford during the years 1923-1928 when Mr. Garrod was professor of poetry Miscellaneous in the extreme , they reveal certain aspects of Mr. Garrod which his more unified volumes on Wordsworth , Keats , and Collins do not show . For instance , in three of them he treats such modern poets as Housman , Rupert Brooke , and Humbert Wolfe , and in doing so betrays less wisdom and skill than we had grown accustomed to expecting from him in the discussion of established names . Not that his old wit and his superb style are any the less in evidence , simply that he is somewhat outside his province As always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently epigrammatic  --  as when , after defending Matthew Arnold 's concern with moral poetry , he goes on to say that he does not mean didactic poetry : " What is the matter with didactic poetry , of course , is not that it is didactic , but that it is not  --  there is nothing to be learned from it . " On other matters , too , Mr. Gan od is equally profound and final . Chief Modern Poets of England and America . Selected and Edited by Gerald DeWitt Sanders and John Herbert Nelson . The Macmillan Company . $2.25 . At last here is an anthology of contemporary verse which has the good sense to confine itself to the work of a few poets and to give a great deal of that . No other scheme is of any practical value , and none certainly has any poetical significance . The editors have chosen twenty-six poets , from Hardy to Millay , and have presented enough material by each  --  in some cases as many as thirty poems  --  to make some kind of judgment possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another uncommon virtue  --  almost always brings the poet in question down to date instead of going over the familiar ground of his early work . In the case of Hardy , indeed , rather too much attention is paid to the later poetry . The Winged Horse Anthology . By Joseph Auslander and Frank Ernest Hill . With Decorations by Paul Honore . Doubleday , Doran and Company $5 . This is a companion volume to " The Winged Horse , " in which Mr. Auslander and Mr. Hill wrote a popular history of poetry . The anthology of British and American poems which they have now made runs all the way from Chaucer and the ballads to Housman , Hardy , Sandburg , Jeffers , Benet , et al . They claim a certain novelty for the book , and they have achieved it by refusing to restrict their selections to the kind of short and often stereotyped lyric inevitable in most such collections . They have gone in for narrative poems of some length , and in the cases of Shakespeare and Marlowe have reprinted distinguished passages from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the major note , " and this was an excellent thing to do in a day when , as we have recently been reminded , anthologies threaten to debauch us with an abundance of trifles . The Oxford Book of Regency Verse Edited by H. S. Milford . Oxford University Press $3.75 Mr. Milford 's anthology covers the period between the " Oxford Book of Eighteenth Century Verse " and the " Oxford Book of Victorian Verse . " It begins , that is to say , with Wordsworth and Coleridge and ends with the early work of Tennyson and Browning . Much of the field was already very familiar , since it contained not only the four poets mentioned but Landor , Byron , Keats , Shelley , and the later Blake . The reader will look still further , however , to the minor figures --  Beddoes , Darley , Hood , Peacock , and Hogg . And particularly in the cases of Darley and Hood , as Mr. Milford promises in his preface , will satisfaction be found . Hood is represented in his graceful serious work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction to the twentieth-century reader .
