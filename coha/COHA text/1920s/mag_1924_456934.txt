You have heard of P ? rtuco . Ancient and far away as once it seemed , it belongs to the day 's news now . Next to the southern fields , the ' light oil ' region , the Pantico district has become the most famous in Mexico and the richest in promise ? for to it belongs Cacalilao . Cacalilao is the new field , the capricious , the generous , the hope-stirring . Over all the Mexican oil coast you hear that lilting name . Cacalilao 's wild well is tamed at last , they are saying . It has thrown forty thousand barrels of oil abroad daily for five days , and dealt death , too . An oil war in Cacalilao has been checked by a Federal Guard . Have you been out to Cacalilao yet ? Must n't miss it . The syllables chirp . Pfinuco is no longer a little town . This metropolis of camps , with all its palm-thatched suburbs , counts , perhaps , ten thousand citizens . Southwest of Tampico it lies ? by land , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must travel more than sixty . There some twenty oil companies have built airy quarters for their workers . They boast a hospital and scores of doctors ; cantinas equipped to furnish anything from aguardiente de cafia , pulque , and tequila to the most urbane cocktails ; a bookshop where you may purchase works amorous , historical , scandalous , and musical , ? including the amores ' of all the popular bullfighters , ? besides the very best talcums . Pfinuco is indeed a city , but there is not such another . It was a burning day of spring when we drove along Tampico 's oily waterfront and paused where the Tamesi joins the Rio Pfinuco , to wait for the barge that has borne so many millionaires and peons overstream . A boy had just been killed by a wild automobile , but no one was permitted to help him before he died because , in Mexico , a person thus injured may not be touched until the police arrive , and sometimes the police are slow . One can but look on while ? perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling its cable cautiously , carrying two Indian girls who had flirted their way across , and then we shot out along the road to Panuco , cloudy now with brown dust , but in the rainy season often impassable for water . The land lay in its autumn , in April , waiting , parched , for the months of rain . Only a light shower or two , and this desert would bloom . Yellow orchids and fantastic air-plants hung from the trees . An exquisite flight of flamingos , like Aurora 's heralds , spread rose-colored above a marsh . We sped through woods where grew mahogany and ebony and where the banyan ? a footpad of the forests ? was strangling foredoomed trees . A special little railroad runs from Tampico to Panuc ? now , but before trains or automobiles threaded that tropical wilderness the trip was made by launches on the river . Tales are still told of the utter intimacy necessary on these journeys . The launches were not large or swift , but they were the only means of getting to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens , pigs , and sewing machines tumidtuously occupied common quarters . There was considerable engine trouble and twenty-four hours was thought to be good time for the one-way trip . Nevertheless , passengers and cargo reached their destination , and a world clamorous for chapopote knows what they accomplished , once the strange company had anchored . Now we were on the road that leads into Pfinuco ? of the many camps and streets , of peons and scientists , of Indian women selling handfuls of fruit at the curb , and women from the States , dainty in their sheer frocks , idle and wistful . Here , surely , great Birnam Wood was coming to Dunsinane ; for mounds of green foliage moved at a good pace , above the dust ! They were only burros , bringing in loads of clover and ojita for fodder , and completely covered by the burden . Sometimes a man was riding inside the greenery , but you never could tell that . It seemed to be just a pageant arranged by Nature . Past the scores of bungalows of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are replaced so easily when they wear out , ? materials being at hand , ? we drove to the ancient plaza of Pfinuco , with its old , high . towered church and its surrounding shops , aboriginal and urban . The plaza got well spattered-up when the Villistas and Carranzistas disagreed around here , back in 1915 ; said a driller who was chasing Isis glass of tequila with a bar of chocolate . ' One lot was up in the church tower and the other was down in the plaza , picking them off . They kept dropping like ripe mangoes and smashing on the stones . ' ' In those days you kept on with the work at the wells ? ' I questioned . ' When we could buy a little protection from either side ? and sometimes when we could n't . ' We had come to the gate of our camp , and the guard hurriedly awoke to open it , disturbing several fat mules at their siesta . This was a peaceful and airy little house where I was to live for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two rooms with beds whitely draped in mosquiteras , which gave them a very ceremonious look ; between the rooms a shower bath , often enriched by oil , although the water came from a settling tank ; doors and windows , always open , on either side ; a verandah verdant with small palms , ferns , and geraniums . ' How still it seems ! ' I said . ' The men are all having dinner , ' explained Mrs. Blairsdale . ' We ' II go , too . ' Over in the camp dining-room , shaded by tall banana trees , where bushes bearing impossible green roses flourished at the door , I viewed with admiration the handiwork of Jumbo , the Chinese cook . The menu seemed overelaborate . I found out later that this was only the usual thing . Chicken and ice cream on Thursday , too , just as in the universities . All the oil-camp cooks are Chinese , highly expert and original , and one weeps to think how beautiful home life in the States might become , could Jumbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private purposes . Why , we had a platter of fresh Oriental candy every night , besides dessert ! For the women of Panuco life is so easy , so robbed of every customary housewife 's task , that its slow tempo enters the mind like an anaesthetic , like lotos poison , stealing energy and purpose , wrapping the spirit in languor , implanting a reluctance to go back to the land where a life so idle must seem a legend . Unless a woman throws off the spell and finds duties for herself , there is absolutely nothing for her to do in Pantie ? . Chinamen cook the meals . Chinese boys come early to sweep the bungalow and bring the drinking-water . They call for the laundry and return it . They take care of the door-yards . The men of the household are far off in the fields from five o'clock in the morning until past six at night , when they return weary and covered with chapopote . The women , meanwhile , read until all novels and magazines seem alike ? although the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their trunks are full of unused embroidered garments . They sleep and nap and sleep again . Pallor comes over the rosiest . One does not need red blood in this burning land . I think if I do n't get to the States before the rainy season starts , I ' 11 go crazy , ' said Mrs. Blairsdale . ' You ca n't imagine how it rains here ! And there are so many hours in the day , even when I do n't wake up till ten , and spend an hour at breakfast , over there in the dining-house by myself , and take a nap in the afternoon and go to bed at eight ! Sometimes when Lew gets in at night , he ' s so dead tired that he turns in at half-past six ; and he ' s gone before it ' s day . ' Yet such a life has its unto charm . After a while one sinks into the dream . To do housework again , to have lists and hours ! We dropped our sewing-scraps on the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always came promptly to sweep . All night the enchanting fragrance of the oleanders in the dooryard along the river bank was blown across the ? room . From the other dooryard , that faced the camp , came the breath of tall tuberoses and of the scented leaves of orange and lemon trees . The silence lay deep . Then , out of the midnight ? uproar , a blare of lights , wild noise ! A fearful , splendid pageant was moving down the river . A gigantic golden ship was towering over the little house . Was it a dream ? No , with such an infernal sound of whistles , surely no sleeper remained in camp ! Nothing but the old oil-barge , ' murmured Mrs. Blairsdale sleepily . They ' 11 keep passing the door all night , and they have to blow right here because there ' s a bend in the river . Once one of them ran down another and turned over . I wish I ' d seen it . ' The phantasma of noise and light passed the bungalow . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a while I grew used to the oil barges forever being pushed down to the Tampico terminals by stern-wheel towboats , and I learned to admire them as they snorted on with such determination and industry through the night . When the river was in flood , the water and the boats rose even nearer to the door . Now the five o'clock work-whistle shrilled , jealous of sleep ; and peons , drillers , supervisors , checkers , foremen sprang from their sultry rest . On the other side of the shower-room I could hear Mr. Blairsdale murmuring persistently to his companion : ' Poor Clem ! Poor old Clem ! But you ' ye got to get up , old man ! ' Soon all the men had breakfasted and gone to their exigent work . Once more the camp lay hot and quiet . It seemed foolish to rise . What for ? However , in time , we did . There 's no sense , ' said Mrs. Blairsdale , in closing these doors . Nobody around . It will be cooler if we leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard an offer so appropriate , so pat , as that which came ten minutes later from a peddler who arrived at this crude moment on the other side of the porch vines . Ropa de modal ' he shouted . Topa muy de moda , muy final ' The Greek bore fashionable clothes ' which he desired to sell us ? with some reason ? at once . All over Mexico go such peddlers , until the desert puts forth organdie . There has been no Kipling to celebrate the strange life of the great oilfields south and west of Tampico What themes have been missed ! What sagas of sweat and courage , of fierce nights and stern days , of wild hopes drooped and faint hopes blossomed ! What life would beat in the true song of the Panne ? ! Before ever I heard of the storied city , or of any particular oil-camp , I firmly believed that the peons who worked in the fields led a life of the utmost misery , and that the hardships of the foreigner 's lot were only less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes in such regions surpassed , I felt sure , the grimiest of our slums . The natives in the oil fields must be wretched , ' I suggested sadly , as we left Tampico . I ' 11 drive you out to Cacalilao tomorrow , ' said the geologist , ' and you can look around as we go along . ' To-day I am wiser . The oil-field peon lives in a Paradise , compared with New Yorkers , for example , who know hall-rooms , skylight-rooms , basements . Has he not always superabundant sunlight and clean air to breathe ? Is there a better-ventilated home in the world than his ? Does not a tender Providence - fairly thrust upon him building materi- ; als and the fruits of the earth ? His simple house is fashioned of bamboo , which grows near by , tied with bejuco , which is everywhere , thatched with palms . In a few years , when too many guests have thronged into the roof , he burns it down and builds another . The floor is of simple mud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , although in the wealthier huts you often see a hammock or two . What use were windows ? The door is ' always open , being , in fact , an opening merely . The better-planned huts are built under or around a large prolific fruit tree ? a plum , an aguacate , a papaya , or a mango ? so that one will be obliged to move as little as possible in order to gather his supplies . The peon 's family tree is worth something to him . There is always a banana plantation in the dooryard . So , with a sturdy woman to pat your tortillas and spank ) our children ? there you are ! In some of the huts we saw sewing machines . Years are needed to pay the high prices which far-traveling salesmen get for them , but they do give one 's but an air . It was at noon that we passed a peon dozing at his door , the chickens , now and then , running over him . His siesta , ' I said benignly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back at four o'clock , he was having a nap , and that night , at eight , we saw him preparing for a real rest . Time means as little to him as to the recording angel , ' said the geologist . He is a hedonistic opportunist . ' I no longer sorrow for the oil-field peons . They enjoy their days off and they take them in sufficient number . Often , beholding the tarnished fate of other Indians , my heart has filled with anger and pity ? those women crouch- ing on the ground with five or ten cents ' worth of gnarled fruit for sale ! Those men in the streets of Cuernavaca with heads bowed almost to their knees under loads too heavy for horses ! Those fat , delightful , brown children , so friendly and gay , so unconscious of the life of privation and labor that lay ahead ! And then those tiny houses , with pointed roofs like dog kennels , in which the workers in the maize and cane fields , further south , dwelt ! But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into the monte and through the abandoned haciendas around Pfinuco , the conviction grew upon me that here dwelt a folk finding more joy in their years than did the earnest and anxious creatures who bother about time , seasons , and rents . Why prod ' these fortunate people with education and make their lives as annoying to them as ours are to us ? I wondered whether Minister Vasconcelos did well to insist on their reading Sophocles . Surely they had accepted fatality more completely and comfortably than the Greeks . On the way to Topila you pass an hacienda that is called ' Paciencia y Aguacate ' ? Patience and the Alligator Pear ! Over stretches of brooding monte , through brown jungle-land , wound a well-worn road . I suppose it was built centuries ago , ' I said . ' Perhaps by the Huastecans , bringing " sticky incense " for their altars . ' I cut it out about a year ago ? I and several mozos ? with machetes . ' The geologist impulsively avoided a large gray snake in the road and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A year ago all this was jungle , solid as a wall . ' We came exploring . I was almost sure there was chapopote up here around Tancoco . We ' d found seepages little black springs and marshes of oil among the trees ; but you ca n't trust a seepage . Oil migrates underground , you see , and it may come out miles from the main reservoir-rock . But what was more important , in this region , was that I ' d noticed outcroppings of red shale . Red shale was the first distinctive formation we encountered in Cacalilao whose depth bore a special significance as to the depth at which the Tamasopo lime might be found . The streak rises toward the surface at an angle which can be gauged . Far beneath , the fishtail bit may reach the top of the San Felipe lime , much harder than the earth above , and , under that a way , should be the top of the Tamasopo lime , harder still . It ' s after the drill strikes through the Tamasopo lime that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Find oil ! ' I caught my breath . One catches the fever , living for a while in PAnuco . ' By now the world knows whether we found it at Cacalilao ! ' exulted the geologist . We had neared a wooded hill , and here at the base , with the wilderness roundabout , was the strangest city ever seen . Thronged bazaars lay on either side of the dusty road . Here you might buy all the fruits of Eden . Here were rebozos by the yard ? and shaving soap and pads and powders and pans . And hanging at the doors of mud-floored , windowless shops were vast quantities of organdie frocks , fiercely orange , tomato , orchid , and flame . And no ! Could one believe his eyes ? Here was Dinty Moore 's cantina ! ' The city of Tancoco , below Tancoco Hill , ' announced my comrade . ' Risen , like Venus , from a sea ? of oil . ' A dark sea . The new , wild well , tamed at such great risk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating a swamp of thick , black chapopote . It had blighted the trees and killed the bushes . Branches drooped black , as if slain by fire . The beauty of nature van . ishes , in the oil fields , once her wealth appears . Where once oil has lain , nothing ever grows again . Yet I have never seen a glorious landscape bring a look of such contentment as that which sometimes comes over the faces of men gazing upon the infernal vista made by flowing wells . They had fought for five days to tame this wild well . Two Chinamen and a Mexican lost their lives from the gas , but the rest wore gas masks and escaped . Rushing from its sunless home in the depths of rock , the oil hurled the drilling tools up against the king block , where they stuck for days . The valve was wrecked . The flow could not be checked . Men were called from every derrick . Company loyalty bowed to the loyalty of the field . Naked and half naked , they slaved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by masks and shields . When a well breaks loose heroism is expected of scientist and peon . Looking at this rich desolation the geologist grew technical . ' They finally closed her in by patine , a steel die collar on the ten-inch swedge nipple , and clamped the valve down so as to secure it on the casing . They connected the flow line right away , and now the oil is pouring into the 55,000-barrel tanks at the pump station . ' There are two ways of getting the oil from the fields to the terminals that line the Mimeo River near Tampico ? to pump it through miles of pipe , reheating it when necessary , and to carry it down in the spectacular barges . The sun seemed to be peering into the growths of the monte , in an interested way . And now we ' d better get out of Tancoco before dark , ' my comrade said suddenly , ' or we may not leave at all . ' I did not feel anxious , for I had every appearance of being an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady in Panuco had lent me displayed no affinity , and so we bought some ten yards of crimson cloth at an Indian village in the hills . This made a splendid faja , or bullfighter 's sash . The ensemble was brilliant . Pity the modest native women , obliged to look upon a foreigner in such a costume and ? infinitely more brazen ! ? sitting on the front seat of an automobile beside a man . ( The woman , of course , should sit in back . ) ' See the soldaderas getting their men 's supper ? and cleaning their boots , excellent women ! ' exclaimed the geologist in admiration . The soldaderas , to whom Sefior Ibanez penned so warm an apostrophe some years ago , are the helpful creatures who follow their men on the march , in the camp , to the fray . On informal occasions they carry the warrior 's pack . If , being a good Indian , he prefers to march barefoot , they carry the Government 's shoes . They attend to the live stock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' But what are all these soldiers doing here , in peaceful , post-revolutionary , American oil-camps ? ' I demanded . ' Oh , one of the States companies is trying to keep us from using our subsurface rights , and they were destroying our machinery and beating off our men at a great rate . One day they ' d Ere more soldiers and the next day we ' d have to increase our guard , to protect our property . It was quite a military competition . But now we ' ve succeeded in bringing the row before the President and we ' re not molested much . ' You see , hunting oil stirs up more bitterness than hunting gold or silver . If you own a mine , you can feel some security . But if you bring in a fine producer and do n't happen to own the land all around it , then somebody else may drill a well a few yards away , and draw the oil out of yours . That ' s why we ' re always in such a hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether we ' re able to transport it to the terminals for a while or not . It ' s a ticklish business . ' That is the reason why one of the companies has chosen this touching name : Tal Vez ? ' Perhaps . ' Imagine a burning hot November . So lay the Panuco in its brown April . And yet , deep in the jungle , rose heraldry of undimmed spring . Ablaze everywhere , on the ground and high in the treetops , were the scarlet inner spears of the jungle-painting Tillandsia ? pages , gorgeously clad , who come before the stalk of pale flowers . Dogwood trees shook their small , golden bells . Loveliest of all were the purple masses of Pknuco wistarias , ' twining with gray moss in festoons overhead . In the open spaces , in the wilderness of that darkening land , the palms stood up like green and brown feather dusters that Nature had stuck into the ground , in some hour of rest , and neglected to use again . Even the fences bloom here ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't kill those red cedars , ' declared the geologist . ' The peon cuts them down , trims them , makes them into a fence , and in a year he has a thick hedge instead . As long as any of the wood is in the ground it grows . The plum trees do that here , too . ' Actually , the peon has fence-orchards of young plums that were once just sticks . More racy of the P ( Inuco are the groves of tall ojita trees , bizarre and beautiful in silhouette against the sky , from whose topmost boughs the fodder of all the burros of the region is cut . Ojita ' is an item on most camp payrolls and is another instance of the extraordinary manner in which Providence provides in the POnuco . While others must cultivate the fodder for their beasts , here they cut it from the treetops . We stopped to calm the engine . The sound of bees , working late , came loud from the fragrant forest . ' Want some honey ? ' asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such speed in that car , would . Then we 'll stop at Don Porfirio 's for a second . ' Don Porfirio was en casa , engaged in telling his boys to get the cows off the road , as we should soon require it . And would we not honor his house by partaking of the cena ? The griddle was already hot for the tortillas . Pardon us , gracias , but a little honey , now , if it were convenient .. . Honey , ? why , naturally ! Don Porfirio vanished among the banana trees , to return with a dinner plate full of beauteous golden comb and two spoons . Such is P &nucan; hospitality . Oil men , when they are feeling hot and out of luck , will swear that the natives are not so polite as the theory states , but out in the wilderness , at least , their courtesy is unfailing . Buenas tardes , ' says the peon , toiling along under his load of wild grass , as you fly past , scattering dust . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravely raising his hand . If you are on foot , in the Pfinuco , your greeting is Buenos dias ' or ' Buenas tardes , ' but when both are mounted you say Adi6s , ' Castilian fashion . Driving out of camp early next day we came upon the Robespierre of Pknuco . A burro , yoked to a large cow , was waiting , his feet braced , look of stolid resolution on his nose , until she should grow calm . The cow was bucking . When she stops he ' 11 go on with his work , ' said the geologist . ' He takes two cows down to the abattoir even day . He goes alone . When he ' s des livered one cow , he goes back and gets the other . Nobody ever has to give him any instructions . He is probably one of the smartest burros in the world . ' We hurried on . We were going out to Tempoal , a native city in the far-off hills . Was ever a city so self-sufficient , so remote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of amazingly good road , for years ago one of the big companies had thought to find oil in that region and had made a smooth way for their trucks . Now it was deserted . The oil had not been found . But everyone was thankful for the service . We were passing a heap of dirt rising from the brush at the wayside . A moment for obeisance , ' ordered the geologist . ' Let me point out La Zurita No. 3 , the largest producer in the Panne ? field ? 25,000,000 barrels to date ! ' He sat lost in affectionate contemplation . That ' s the kind of well we love ! No more anxious work at the rig . No more explosions . No more fighting your oil away from you , underground . Just a nice peaceful heap of dirt , pour . ing out chapopote day and night , into the tanks , through the pump lines , to the world ! ' Who would dream , ' I pondered , that a big producer looked like this after it had settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half so impressive as the rigs .. People do n't call this little mound an oil well , you know ! ' You have beheld , ' murmured the geologist happily , ' the sort of well that everyone around Tampico prays to call his own . ' We drove respectfully away . There had been a shower in the sight . and as we flew along we startled into multicolored flight clouds of ex- , visite butterflies ? white , yellow , and pale green ? that were sipping deliriously at the puddles . Shining out by the roadside , milkweed showed what it could do in the tropics , where its flowers are half golden , half vermilion , a very Spanish display . ' El Higo ? we ' 11 stop and call on the idol . ' For everyone does , yet the ancient , solemn idol , dug up somewhere in the hills , keeps his aboriginal state . The limestone figure stands on a knoll , near a store : His wife out in the monte yet , ' an Indian told us . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! arcs and penates of times remote . Out of little mounds , when the Indians come to use them for sites or cemeteries , are dug hundreds of stone dolls , images , gods , dishes , tools . Some of the small heads are magnificently chiseled , the faces wearing unmistakable expressions of amusement , scorn , or joy , when they arc not grotesques . I have seen , in the Pantie ? , old women 's heads , carved of limestone or modeled in clay , that were Grecian in perfection . Rich as Vera Cruz is well known to be in ancient remains , one suspects that the archaeologists have not yet sniffed some of the wonders cherished in the oil region . The natives take scant interest in their antigiiedades ' except when someone wants to buy them ; for they have been digging up these relics all their lives and giving them to their children for playthings . To many of the foreign oil nice , too , they are barbarous commonplaces . But now and then you will find an amateur archmologist whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tools of jadeite untold centuries ago , and gathered in the course of his labors in the fields , is amazing . And while he treasures his stone images and dishes he wonders wistfully if he ' 11 be able to get any of them back home ? perhaps enough for a Fountain of Antiquities from the Pantie ? . Of dates and tribal names he knows little , yet he has somehow learned a good deal about archmological collecting . I know one rig supervisor who has the most fascinating ? but there , that is his secret ! We were surprised , as we drove past bamboo huts in the monte , to see hanging at the doors magnificent striped skins . In Mexico every forest cat is a tigre . ' Jaguars , pumas , oceolots , and more ordinary wildcats ? tigers they are , according to their power , and tigers they are named . They are still plentiful here . Along the road cut from the cliff-side we were approaching Tempoal . Before the gate which guarded the city on the hilltop , feudal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . Hearing our snorting engine he calmly rose and opened . We threw him ten centavos and climbed with caution the steep , cobbler ! street . All Tempoal gazed at us with wide , black eyes . Nude babies , the pink of their skins contending with the brown , scuttled into the doorways . We reached the plaza . Here was an Indian metropolis perched on a lonely hilltop , forgetting the world . On the shady side of a statue of a military leader who had been born in this city sat the helado seller . Would we have cylinders of shaved ice , flavored diversely , or balls of snow colored with the juices of fruits ? Raspas , helados , or mere limonadas ? with such a stock of cool refrescos any fancy might be suited ! Is there an ice factory here ? ' we questioned in surprise . TOrno no ? ' When the oil men were in Temkoal they had established a power plant . They might have electricity in any house if they liked , but no Indian liked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pfinuco , I was to see miracles . I was to associate in perilous intimacy with wells that might devour me and the landscape at any moment . Before my awestruck eyes other wells would bring up snow from Inferno . I would be burned and frozen in the same instant . To-day I , most fortunate , would behold wells single of their fantastic kind , of which scientists talk in Persia and Siberia : wells at the world 's end : wells of wonder . ' We ' II start early for Loma del Pozo No. 1 , ' said the geologist , ' and you can watch her making snow and ice . ' In the distance rose the brown ranges of the Topila hills , that would turn green with the rains . We passed the pleasant old hacienda , ' The Horseshoe , ' once proud and prosperous , now uncultivated . Sometimes , ' I said , ' I look out over this plain for miles , and I ' 11 see an Indian hurrying along on a burro , way off the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huts . ' We were crossing wide stretches of bad lands , with still those tall palms sticking up like green and brown feather dusters . Not all the haciendados live in town , ' said the geologist . ' Some of them , before oil was found out here , owned a little land . Of course they did n't farm it . Fruits dropped at their door . And then they found chapopote underneath that almost worthless soil ! The duefio ? perhaps he was a peon , perhaps a small landowner of the old aristocracy ? knew better than to sell , you may be sure . He rented , and now , in this same hut , he dwells ? a millionaire . There ' s old Victoriano Cruz ? just one example . I wo n't tell you where he lives , because some bandit might overhear us and torture you to find out . But one day when I called to see him , his rickety board table was covered with gold .

" " Well , I ' m going to bury this in the banana patch . Come back in an hour , and if you can find it , it ' s yours , " the old rascal wagered . But bandits did get some of his gold , in the revolution . ' Seven thousand pesos a month , ' I whispered , awestruck . ' Why , back in Pi ine ? I know an old Mexican who gets 180,000 pesos a year , just in rentals . I do n't believe he spends 180 . What he does with his thousands , heaven knows ! Of course he would n't go near a bank . ' Our thoughts were financial and wistful . The purple-flowered vines , the bright yellow dogwood-boughs , the blazing inner spears of the Tillandsia , fled past . Now shut your eyes , for in a minute , ' my comrade told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sights of this World . ' In a black desert which it had itself created stood the Ice Well . Hour after hour , month after month , in that lonely place , Loma del Pozo No. 1 had been forming its tall white cylinder of ice in the face of the powerful sun . The gigantic forces which brought the gases up from great depths seemed to be struggling like stubborn Titans to build the glittering column ever a little higher . But for a long while now it had not grown . When it exceeds a certain height it breaks off . Long before ore reached this well the roar of the ascending gas rumbled in the treetops , and ouas. we came nearer there was such a sand of sizzling and frying as must mark Hell 's kitchen . For Loma del Pozo No. 1 is making snow as well as ice . If this snow touches one 's hand , he can not tell whether the sensation is of freezing or burning ; but when , flung far from the icy mouth of the hole , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the whites of eggs on a griddle . How far has it risen ? ' I questioned , a trifle appalled by the infernal display . Loma del Pozo is over 3000 feet deep . ' Has it made no oil at all ? Only this endless outpouring of gas ? ' It has . The Ice Well has a long story . They completed it in 1915 for an initial production of about 5000 barrels of oil and 20,000,000 cubic feet of gas . When the well came in , it hurled out t400 feet of six-inch casing . But after it had made about a hundred thousand barrels of oil , salt water appeared , so they pinched it in until it flowed only gas . And now you see it , working away fiercely , as it ' s been working for over seven years . ' For seven years this Titan had been bearing up from a depth of 3000 feet and flinging into the atmosphere twenty million cubic feet of gas a day . To tell the truth , ' I said , whispering as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know just what makes that ice and snow . ' This gas contains a very high percentage of carbon dioxide . The sudden expansion causes the condensation and solidification of the water vapor in the atmosphere ? a process which takes place in the form of that coating of ice around the valve of the well . In time this transformation has built up a regular tube of ice , as you could see if you were n't too careful of your shoes , and the gas rushes up through it as through a pipe . These white flecks all over the ground are practically pure carbon-dioxide snow . We ' 11 have time to get to No. 2 before lunch . This stuff wo n't burn you ? Try it in your hand . It just stings . ' Alas , Loma del Pozo No. 2 is a famous example of the mean way in which the powers underground can bring to nothing the most skillful drilling ! There it was , all rigged , machinery in a long caravan waiting to begin its task , the crew on duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is 3103 feet deep , and an inverted monument to persistence . When the drill was pounding at 3070 feet , it opened some vast reservoir and out rushed fifty million cubic feet of gas . We checked it , in time , ' the geologist explained , by pumping the hole full of mud . That filled up the crevice through which the gas was entering . Then we started drilling again , but bend over and look down and see what happened . When we were trying to bail out the hole the bailer got caught right beneath the valve there , and now the well is bridged with pieces of lime that have collected between the bailer and the casing . ' I stooped to peer at the disaster . The Titans were bellowing ominously , far down . Of course , ' added my comrade , ' it may break loose at any moment . ' I could see the bailer , a pail forty feet long , barring the giants ' ascent . Drilling will be resumed just as soon as we get it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed that a Chinaman , upon the brow of a hill , was bending his Oriental scrutiny upon us . It ' s way past dinner time , and I suppose Arthur 's keeping it for us . ' He wiped off the chapopote with a wad of waste . Outside the cook-house we washed our hands in handsome white-enamel basins , in water well heated by the sun . Then once more I was astounded by the magnificent dinner that you always get at the oil camps and can never get in the towns . It was n't even Thursday , and yet , as we slid on to the wooden benches at table and daintily chose paper napkins adorned with daffodils , Arthur brought us , I do n't , ' said I to Arthur frankly , get this at home . ' Boy picked lemons out on monte yesterday , ' replied Arthur hospitably , ' You have some more drink ? ' The water at the camps is brown and warm , but less dangerous than the clear cold drink you rashly take from the artistic earthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' You have to be careful , of course , being a newcomer . But out exploring we ' re not so squeamish . Once one of the boys washed by mistake in the only drinking-water in camp , and we had to use it anyway . ' The geologist pretended to eat , but meals are better than appetites when you ' ye been in the fields for months . As we returned to the veteran automobile I had another shock . What is that lying on that bunk ? Vanity Fair . And , good heavens , The Broom ! I suppose Cabell is popular among the peons ? ' Reserve your airs . Of course we get plenty of reading matter at the camps . I brought a load of new magazines from Tampico last Monday . ' ' Chicken , jelly pocketbooks , wild lemons , current periodicals , natural warm baths , ' I meditated . ' The ordeal of camp life ! ' We drove for a while through a forsak- en land and came to a sign : ' Danger ? Proceed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want , you can tease this well a bit . I only wish it would break loose while you ' re doing it . That would be an experience you ' d always remember , if you got away . ' The craving for adventure edged my comrade 's tone . We were many paces off , yet I could hear the steady rumble of Quebrache No. 1 , suppressing a desire to blow us to perdition . This was a Wicked one . It had made for itself a crater like a volcano 's , and low in the centre it hissed and roared and shot out gleaming fragments of snow to fry upon the gravel . It had laid waste the land around , but not with oil . Like a bad boy among the Titans , it had flung stones and was panting to fling more . Deep and far had spread the rocky barrage . I climbed down to gaze into the steaming throat of Quebrache No. 1 , ready to if it should suddenly come in . The completion of this well , in 1915 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas , bursting from the depths , demolished the derrick and the valve on the casing . The valve has not been replaced ; there was but a slight showing of oil . Still , who knows what wealth the monster may be hiding ? It ' s bridged now with bits of lime and shale , ' the geologiSt explained , hurling rocks with beautiful accuracy into the well 's threatening mouth , in the hope of rousing it to a fresh out ? burst for my instruction and possible destruction . ' Be ready to run and get behind that tree in case I stir her up . But during the times when it ' s gassing it throws out these enormous quantities of shale , lime ; and flint . I estimate that it makes at least 20,000,000 cubic feet of gas a day . Lookout ! ' He had discovered a six-foot length of pipe , and daring all for science , had climbed down into the crater and thrust it vigorously into the well . If that does n't make her break loose , nothing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't run yet , you ' 11 hear it strike , ' said he in an interested , leisurely way . We did hear it strike , and then , with a wild subterranean roar and a charge of hissing gases , Quebrache broke . I fancy we must have made good time . I had the handicap , for my comrade was in the crater ; but we were both behind the tree before the bombardment of rocks . I covered my eyes , but I could hear his calm scientific classification : ' Green shale , gray shale , lime , flint , chert . ' Under cover of the sparse bushes , bending low , we easily got out of range and gained the road . ' I know that gas is n't asphyxiating , ' stated the geologist , so it is useless to pretend you ' re dead . Hurry up . I ' ve saved the most incredible well for the last . ' No solitary maker of snow and ice , no muffled giant nor costly disaster was this last strange well , Quebrache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rig the extemporaneous houses of the peons lined the road . Coated head to foot with chapopote , men came striding from the field . Then we saw it ? the unearthly vista : two reservoirs , one above the other , wide , deep , and black , and flowing down to them , a slow dark river , the flood of ' frozen oil . ' The sun beat savagely down . Sweat mingled with chapopote on our faces . But crossing the sticky field , and crouching beneath the rig to touch that thick river , I cried , ' Why it ' s cold ! ' For this heavy stream of oil , as it rose from the well in the face of the sun , teas to the touch as ice . And it looked exactly like very good fudge , just be- fore it hardens . Only when it moved ? majestically down the slope and began to enter the reservoirs did it thin and melt a little . Quebrache No. 2 is one of the new marvels . It was completed in 1922 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 3015 feet . By January 1923 , the amount of gas had increased to about 30,000,000 , and early in March this gas became slightly moist . The moisture gradually increased , too , ' the rig supervisor told me , gazing tenderly at his great black pet , ' until now this well is making about 5000 barrels of 19-gravity oil . Come closer . Watch it pour out . ' What ? ? ' I began , but the geologist ha . d the reason ready . The high percentage of carbon dioxide in the gas is causing , through its rapid expansion , the freezing of this oil as it emerges from the valve . ' The supervisor brought us glasses of brown warm water , settled , . boiled and safe . We drank to the wells of wonder . Darkness fell suddenly upon the road from the festoons of gray moss and purple-flowered vines . Would you like a swim ? ' inquired the geologist . I traced the answer in the chapopote on my face . Well , there is a party planned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the beach at Las Piedras . The river is warm . Afterward we ' 11 make a fire . ' I sank into happy contemplation . An all-over warm bath , after these ineffective cold showers ! Besides , the geologist had told me how he had glanced up one afternoon , in the very midst of his splashing , to see a fiat-headed adder coiled around the spray . ' It seemed to be just thinking , ' he said easily . ' Of me , perhaps . ' ? The Mimeo , its brown flood silvered by the moon , lapped the soft grass on the bank . We scampered down , and the soothing waters took us . Who has not bathed in a tropical river by moonlight has missed one of this world 's enchantments . Some of us floated with the gentle stream and passed the forbidden bend . This was the peons ' part of the river , where they were swimming all naturel . Come back , ' called the rest ? Gringos must n't go there . ' But the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand that mark its course to Tampico , the dark Piinuco , beneath its peaceful surface , is sinister and swift . One had to fight to return . A peon was gathering a great heap of palm leaves for some thatching to be clone to-morrow ? mafiana or pasado mariana ? and his burro grazed near by . We built our fire and made the coffee . I lay in the thick grass and marveled . In the States we ' d be eaten alive , doing this . Why have you deceived me ? Where are the garrapatas , the pinolillas ? And mosquitoes ? Why ' ? I correctly used the Spanish double negative ? ' there is not even a cloud no bigger than a man 's hand ! ' You ' 11 see , doubting Thomas ? I can show you the scars in the back of my neck where they burrowed in , too , ' threatened someone in the grass . ' Better put on your stockings . The niguas prefer toenails , you know . You might lose a foot . The Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred . Perhaps the dry season had baked away these ferocious insects . Perhaps they were less terrible than the tales about them . Anyway , they did not ap . pear , although that coast produces infinitesimal monsters : the garrapata , which screws himself into your flesh and has to be smoked out , when halfway in , with a hot cigarette ; the pinolilla , which attacks in the manner of our northern chiggers ; the nigua , and the familiar sand-flies . What drowsy peace marked this moonlit midnight by the warm , swift river ! The palm-gatherer had spread his ancient sarape , and lay on the grass , smoking restfully and with a certain elegance . He knew that presently we would go , and he would fall heir to our fire . His liberated burro cropped the soft grass on the knolls , contemplating us mildly , now and then , like a large gray rabbit . Lovable is the burro . Is there any poor person around here ? ' we asked the palm gatherer . Alguien que quiere los restos de nunstra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not rich myself , ' he said . We filled his red handkerchief with devil 's food and chicken . The burro nibbled on under the moon . His coat was very soft , his disposition gentle . I leaned my cheek against his neck . What are you sighing about ? ' demanded the geologist . I have taken to this burro , ' I told him , ' and it is n't likely that I ' 11 ever see him again . ' ( But in truth it was the Plunico lotus , languorous now in my veins , too. )
