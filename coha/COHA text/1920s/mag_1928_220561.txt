In the ringed and shadowy eyes of animals , more clearly than in the secretive countenance of man , is expressed the mystery , the dark sorrow of existence . Of all beasts , dogs are perhaps the most melancholy in their looks ; of all dogs , the slouching basset hound is the most sad . Of all basset hounds , none is more woebegone , more tragic than a certain basset hound puppy . Last week he sat nuzzling his weak chin into the loose bib of flesh which an arbitrary heredity has draped around his neck . In the kennels , at Huntington , L. I. , of Gerald M. Livingston , his forlorn yapping roused to dreary derision a crow in the near woods . Perhaps the basset hound puppy heard a prophecy in the dismal utterances of the black bird ; what , he wondered , did the future hold for him , a prince of basset hounds , by Walhampton Andrew ( titles : International Champion , English Champion , American Champion ) , out of Walhampton Dainty ? The puppy yelped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More sad , if possible , would have been his looks had he been aware that life , for all princes a prison , is cruel especially to a prince of basset hounds . Had he , last week , been carried from his country kennel to Madison Square Garden , where the 52nd Annual Dog Show of the Westminster Kennel Club was in progress , his sensitive heart must have trembled with the terror that afflicts a small boy when he is taken , for the first time , to school . Unlike poodles or pomeranians , basset hounds are not pleased by admiring stares ; they prefer running in the fields and smelling footprints in the grass . What would have been the small basset hound 's reaction had the greatest U. S. dog show been carefully described to him , had some crass soothsayer delineated for his amazement an event like many in which he will , there can be no doubt , participate ? <P> On the lowest floor of Madison Square Garden , in long tiers of boxlike berths , sat some 2,410 dogs . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others Afghan hounds , Eskimos , Norwegian Elk-hounds , Pinschers ( Doberman ) , Salukis , Schnauzers ( miniature ) , Samoyedes ; 17 were miscellaneous . All were in varying states of trepidation or delight , depending upon their personalities . Those who were in trepidation slept or snarled ; those who enjoyed the dog show , as many women enjoy large dinner parties , sat up and preened their coats , or barked merrily . To stroll into this lowest floor , where the dogs were " benched " was like strolling into a rout or reception , as imagined by some satirist whose fancy was for the morbid &; grotesque ; a tramp would have died , surely &; instantly , of fright . <P> The noise made by the dogs was loud and horrible . A small , stupid child , like many who attended the dog show , reached out a paw toward a vast belligerent St. Bernard who was lounging in his sawdust covered stall , swathed in a towel lest the slobber from his mouth should stain his sleek and tonsured fur . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barked at the St. Bernard ; an Airedale yelped at the collie ; soon , all the dogs were in a noisy fury . The people whose business it was to care for the dogs were never disconcerted ; they chatted to each other with feigned indifference to the continued chaos all around them . Many women sat in the bench-berths which had been intended for canine occupancy .
