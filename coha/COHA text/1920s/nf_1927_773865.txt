txt HOST-PARASITE RELATIONS : INTESTINAL PROTOZOA iodine solution or of methylene blue for flagellate infections . Such treatment might be efficacious against organisms such as the flagellate , Trichomonas hominis , which lives in the lumen of the large intestine , but probably does not destroy organisms such as endamcebae and coccidia that live in the wall of the intestine . In a similar fashion certain investigators advise vaginal douches with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate to destroy the flagellate , Trichomonas vaginalis ( Fig. 7 ) , which ordinarily lives in the acid secretions of the vagina . It seems possible that drugs taken by mouth may act directly upon the parasites within the intestine . Iodamceba williamsi ( Fig. 4a ) is destroyed by the administration of emetin although it lives in the lumen of the intestine . In this case the emetin may kill the parasite by actual contact . Progress in the chemotherapy of protozoan infections has been most gratifying within the past two decades . Quinine was already in use in the seventeenth century as a cure for malaria , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered . Emetin was introduced by Sir Leonard Rogers for amoebic dysentery in 1912 and soon came into general use ; more recently yatren and stovarsol have both been proved to be specific agents for the cure of this disease . In 1905 Thomas inaugurated the treatment of trypanosomiasis with atoxyl and to this have since been added tartar emetic , tryparsamide , Bayer 205 and Pasteur 309 . Tartar emetic which was discovered by Vianna in 1913 to be efficacious against American leishmaniosis , has been found to be equally valuable for the treatment // of kala-azar and oriental sore . No therapeutic agents are yet available for intestinal flagellates , ciliates , and coccidia . Whether these drugs act directly on the parasite or through the host is still in doubt . In a recent illuminating address Dale ( 1924 ) states the situation in the following words . " The conception of a remedy not killing the parasites immediately , but modifying their virulence , or lowering their resistance to the body 's natural defences ; of a remedy not acting as such , but in virtue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxic product , either by a modification of its structure or by its union with some tissue constituent ; of an affinity of the remedy for certain cells of the host 's body , leading to the formation of a depot from which , in long persistent , never dangerous concentration , the curative substance is slowly released ; all these conceptions present themselves , again and again , as necessary for our present rationalisation of the effects observed . It can hardly be doubted that they will potently influence the methods by which , in the immediate future , new and still better specific remedies are sought . But though our practical aim , in relation to the affinities of a remedy for the parasite and for the host 's tissues , may be radically changed the meaning of these specific affinities , so delicately adjusted to a precise molecular pattern , remains dark . " II . ROUTE TAKEN BY PARASITES IN ESCAPING FROM THE HOST As already noted , parasites must not only reproduce within the host but their offspring must be able to escape // and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In most cases escape is easy since the parasites attack parts of the host from which natural channels lead to the outside , e.g. , intestinal protozoa pass out with the feces . The escape of sufficient trichoronads from the mouth and vagina to keep these races from dying out is probably brought about by kissing and coitus respectively . III . Host-Parasite Specificity By host-parasite specificity is meant the character of the relations between species of parasites and species of hosts with respect to host susceptibility and parasite infectivity . Hosts and parasites may be divided into groups and labeled according to their interspecific relations , since observations and experiments have built up a considerable body of facts regarding this subject ; but what environmental conditions and host and parasite characteristics are responsible for the facts observed are still very obscure . I. HOST SUSCEPTIBILITY Parasitologists have long recognized different types of hosts with respect to their susceptibility to various parasites . Thus if a host is easily parasitized by a certain species it is said to be tolerant , whereas if it is difficult to parasitize it is classed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a certain species in nature is known as a natural or autochthonous host ; whereas one that does not become so parasitized may be considered a foreign host . If a species of parasite that // habitually lives in a certain host species is found in a host that is very seldom infected , that host is spoken of as an accidental or casual host . A host may become infected but throw off the infection after a short time , in which case it is known as a provisional or transitory host ; or it may serve as a host for a short stage in the life-cycle of a parasite , thus becoming a temporary host . An infection may be acute , malignant , fulminating , chronic or benign , but the evidence does not indicate that the susceptibility of the host to an infection has any bearing on the character of the infection induced . That is to say , a host may be more susceptible to infection , and probably usually is , by a species of parasite that never calls forth symptoms than by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a host is easily parasitized by a species , the parasite is said to be highly infective . How much its infectivity is due to the host and how much to the parasite it is impossible to say . Several of the terms noted above with respect to hosts are also commonly used to designate different types of parasites . Thus , we speak of natural parasites , accidental parasites , and provisional , transitory or temporary parasites . Parasites are also classified according to the necessity of existence within a certain host as facultative , when this is not required , and obligate , when the parasite is unable to live in any other host . The invasive powers of a parasite are indicated by such terms as virulent or aggressive and the degree of infectivity with respect to the effects on the host as pathogenic , sublethal , and lethal . // Two extremes of host-parasite specificity may be illustrated by the relations which have been found in the writer 's laboratory to exist between ( I ) the giardias of mammals and ( 2 ) the herpetomonad flagellates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been carrying on a series of investigations ( Simon , 1921 , 1922 ; Hegner , 1922a , 1922b , 1923b , 1924d , 1925c ) which seem to indicate that the giardias found in each species of host differ specifically from those found in every other species of host and only in a few cases is more than one species of host infected by one species of giardia . Thus morphologically distinct species have been described from tadpoles , house mice and rats , field mice , rabbits , cats , dogs , guinea-pigs , and ground squirrels as well as from certain birds and reptiles . Here then is an example of very rigid host-parasite specificity . In contrast to this are the results of Becker 's ( 1923 ) studies on the herpetomonad flagellates that live in the intestine of flies . Investigators previous to Becker 's work assumed that each species of fly was infected with its own peculiar species of herpetomonad and hence when a new species of fly was found to be infected the organism was given a new specific name . Becker carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different genera and found that each species could be infected with herpetomonads from each of the other five species . Because of these results and of the fact that no morphological differences could be observed between the various so-called species , Becker concludes that the flagellates from these six species of flies are all of the same species , ? that first described from the house fly , // Musca domestica , as Herpetomonas muscat-domesticce . These results have been confirmed and extended by Drbohlav ( 1925b ) . 3 . SOME PROBLEMS IN HOST-PARASITE SPECIFICITY AMONG INTESTINAL PROTOZOA Biological studies of the relations between protozoan parasites and their hosts , especially man , have within the past thirty years brought about a marked change in our ideas regarding host-parasite specificity . Until quite recently the belief was prevalent that cross-infection is the rule in nature ; for example , that man is infected with protozoa of lower animals and that lower animals are regularly parasitized by human protozoa . Thus , where several decades ago one species was supposed to inhabit a number of species of hosts we know to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its own species of parasites , which appear to be rigidly adjusted to it and unable to live in any other species of host . Some of the problems involved in the study of host-parasite specificity are stated in the following paragraphs and suggestions are presented to account for the facts observed . The conclusion reached is that we know very little about this interesting and important subject , but that further experimental study is possible and desirable . ( I ) To WHAT EXTENT DOES THE BEHAVIOR OF THE HOST AND THAT OF THE PARASITE DETERMINE HOSTPARASITE SPECIFICITY ? This problem involves particularly the question of transmission ( Hegner , 1926d ) . It is obvious that host and parasite must be brought together under favorable conditions when the host is sus- // ceptible and the parasite infective . This can be done in the laboratory with hosts and parasites that do not ordinarily encounter each other in nature . A study of protozoan transmission in nature , however , reveals the fact that the parasite is passive during its passage from one host to another and that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is responsible for transmission . " Intestinal " protozoa are transmitted in the active ( trophozoite ) stage or in the form of cysts . Those inhabiting the mouth and vagina are probably transferred by contact , entirely by the host , during kissing or coitus . These appear to be present in from one-third to one-half of the general population . Those that live in the intestine are transmitted by the contamination of food or drink with feces containing cysts or trophozoites . The host , man , is responsible for the proper disposal of his own feces so that food or drink may not become contaminated . Dy certain methods of control , such as the elimination of infected food handlers , of the common towel , of soil pollution and house flies , he can to a considerable degree prevent the spread of infection . That insanitary conditions are prevalent is indicated by the high incidence of infection among the general population , which is estimated approximately as follows : 50 per cent with Endamccba coli , 25 per cent with Endolimax nana , Io per cent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odamceba williamsi , 15 per cent with Giardia lamblia , and io per cent with Chilomastix mesnili . Frequently one individual is infected with two or more of these species at the same time . Fortunately Endamceba histolytica is the only pathogenic species of great importance in this list . // The differences in the percentages noted above and the small numbers of infections that have been recorded for the other species of intestinal protozoa that occur in man are probably due principally to two factors : first , the success of the species in gaining entrance to the digestive tract , and second , the infectivity of the species in the human host . Trichomonas hominis , for example , does not possess a cyst stage in its life-cycle and hence must pass from man to man in the trophozoite stage ( Hegner , 1924a ) . The trophozoite stage is not as resistant as the cyst stage ; hence it is more often destroyed before ingested by man than are cysts . This may account for the fact that less than Io per cent of the general population seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist between species that are spread by cysts . Endamc , ba coli , with infections in about 5o per cent of its possible hosts , seems much more successful than Endamcuba histolytica with an incidence of infection of only about Io per cent . This is true in spite of the fact that E. histolytica cysts are apparently more abundant in fecal material from a host than those of E. coli . The chances of reaching new , susceptible hosts seems about the same for the two species . There may be a difference in the resistance of the cysts of the two species while outside of the body , especially since the degree of resistance depends somewhat on the thickness of the cyst wall . Perhaps E. coli is more successful because its ripe cysts normally contain eight nuclei and presumably give rise to eight offspring within the intestine , whereas the cysts of E. histolytica possess only four nuclei . This would give E. coli a better chance of starting an infection . The // activities of the two species are also different within the intestine . E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas E. histolytica apparently depends on tissue elements from the intestinal wall . E. histolytica must therefore gain access to this tissue and successfully attack it against the resistance of the host , whereas E. coli is continually bathed in a favorable nutrient rne-dium . Furthermore , E. histolytica often brings about a diarrheic or dysenteric condition during which no infec-tive ( cyst ) stages are passed by the host , and sometimes this species actually brings about the death of the host , thus destroying its own chances of further distribution . The conclusion is reached that the behavior of the host or intermediate host plays an important role in host-parasite specificity since the infective stage of a parasite can reach its specific host only by being passively transferred by the latter ; and this must occur regularly in nature in order that the race of parasites may continue to exist . ( 2 ) Do SPECIES OF PROTOZOAN PARASITES THAT ARE RESTRICTED TO ONE SPECIES OF HOST GAIN ACCESS TO OTHER SPECIES OF HOSTS ? The answer to this question differs for the different species of parasites and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosts and intermediate hosts . Man 's food and drink , for example , are no doubt frequently contaminated by the feces of rats , mice , cats , dogs , and other domestic animals that contain living , in-fective cysts of various intestinal protozoa , such as Endamceba muris of the rat , Giardia canis of the dog , and Isospora f elis of the cat . No human beings , however , // have ever been reported with infections due to these species . We may conclude therefore that the infective stages of human protozoa frequently gain access to lower animals and that those of the latter gain access to man . The entrance of the infective stages of a species of parasite into a host is necessary for host-parasite specificity , but is only one factor in this relationship . ( 3 ) WHAT FACTORS WITHIN A HOST ENABLE NATURAL PARASITES AND PREVENT FOREIGN PARASITES FROM BRINGING ABOUT AN INFECTION ? To answer this question we should consider that part of the host in which the parasite lives as its particular habitat , just as we look upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both free-living and parasitic protozoa are at times subjected to certain factors in their habitats that are harmful , and successful life and reproduction depend on the severity of these harmful factors . The digestive juices of the host , for example , have been considered destructive to trophozoites even of natural protozoan parasites . The cyst wall of intestinal protozoa protects the organism f rom many conditions outside of the body and may play an important role in the initiation of an infection ; for example , it may react to the digestive juices of the host , or to secretions of the parasite within the cyst stimulated by the intestinal environment , so as to liberate the enclosed parasite and give it a chance to maintain itself there ; or it may fail to liberate the parasite and thus prevent infection . We know so little about excystation that nothing definite can be said on this subject . // Among the variable conditions within the intestine are those due to the character of the diet . Carnivorous animals are very seldom parasitized by intestinal protozoa ( Hegner , 1923a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and man can be relieved of some of these organisms if fed on a carnivorous diet . Such a change of diet brings about many profound changes in the intestinal contents , which apparently make them unfit as a medium for the growth and multiplication of certain protozoa . The character of the intestinal contents resulting from the normal dietary of the host may thus prevent a foreign species from initiating an infection even if it succeeded in reaching the normal location in the host unharmed . The character of the digestive juices , failure of cysts to excyst , the character of the diet , and various other factors may , therefore , encourage or prevent parasites that gain access to the body of the host from setting up an infection . ( 4 ) HOW MAY WE ACCOUNT FOR LABORATORY INFECTIONS IN FOREIGN HOSTS ? It is possible in certain cases to bring about an infection in a certain host species in the laboratory that appears never to become parasitized in nature . Several explanations suggest themselves to account for this phenomenon . In the first place , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as never to encounter the infective stages of the parasite in nature . For example , we would hardly expect an animal that does not live in association with man to become infected with human parasites , although it might be susceptible as indicated by laboratory experiments . The Sa PROBLEMS IN HOST-PARASITE SPECIFICITY number of parasites that gain access to a host may be an important factor ; that is , a few specimens may not succeed in bringing about an infection , whereas large numbers of specimens might . The necessity for the presence of large numbers of parasites may account for the great number of clinical cases of amoebiasis that occur in the tropics , where the ingestion of large numbers of cysts is favored by meteorological and insanitary conditions . The method of entrance of the parasites may play a role in the initiation of an infection . For example , cats apparently do not often become parasitized by Endam ( rba histolytica in nature but may be infected in the laboratory in several ways . The method that results in the greatest success seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce stasis by surgical ligature of the large intestine and then inoculate cysts anterior to the ligature . Their experiments show that excystation occurs at the point of stasis and that no excystation might take place if stasis was not induced . Many infections are no doubt prevented in nature by the rapid passage of the cysts through the digestive tract . We can thus account for laboratory infections in foreign hosts by the bringing together of a host and parasite that do not ordinarily become associated in nature ; or by the use of very large numbers of parasites ; or by procedures not possible in nature . ( 5 ) WHAT CONDITIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DIFFERENCES IN SUSCEPTIBILITY BETWEEN YOUNG AND ADULT ANIMALS ? The greater susceptibility of young animals to infection has been abundantly demonstrated in the // case of many species of protozoa . Surveys of intestinal protozoa in various parts of the world have established the fact that children , as a rule , are more highly infected than adults . Perhaps hosts that are infected while young acquire immunity before the adult stage is reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a host for only a brief period can not be considered entirely successful as a specific parasite . Similar results have been obtained in laboratory experiments ; for example , kittens become infected with Endamccba lhistolytica much more readily than adult cats . There are no essential differences among the cysts used in such experiments ; hence the factors involved must reside in the hosts . Some type of resistance develops with age . Are the cysts of intestinal protozoa unable to excyst ? Are the trophozoites prevented in some way from entering the tissues ? Does the medium ( intestinal content ) become unfavorable as the host grows older ? Finally the point may be emphasized that the subject of host-parasite specificity is one that needs and is worthy of careful investigation , and that this section is intended merely to indicate some of the interesting problems involved . IV . Problems in Host-Parasite Relations among Intestinal Protozoa The succeeding chapters in this book are devoted to a discussion of the Intestinal Amoebae , Intestinal Flagellates , Intestinal Coccidia , and Intestinal Infusoria of man . An attempt is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so f ar as the material is available . In doing this many problems that are awaiting solution are indicated . An examination of these groups abundantly demonstrates that the ratio between what we know and what we do not know about the host-parasite relations between man and these intestinal protozoa is decidedly in favor of the latter . Furthermore , a survey of the literature shows that contributions to our knowledge of this subject are due largely to chance and not to concerted activities and without any well thought-out program in mind . As a rule , the investigator uses the material that happens to be available at the moment and undertakes the study of problems that occur to him without respect to any of the larger questions involved . This situation is , of course , due partly to the fact that most investigators are able to spend only part of their time on research and that very seldom are more than one or two investigators at work at the same institution along similar lines . The adoption of a program , such as that discussed in this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , medicine and public health would without doubt be most helpful and economical , since it would furnish a general objective and at the same time allow as much individual initiative as any investigator could desire . It is perhaps too much to expect a combination of circumstances to arise that will put into effect such a Utopian situation as that described , but at any rate it can do no harm to provide a program that presents the problems involved according to a logical plan . The subjects that especially need investigation are // in general the same as those discussed in Section II above . It may be worth while , however , to repeat them here . Table No special section in this chapter is devoted to the practical aspects of host-parasite relations . These , however , are always kept in mind and any new data obtained are always scrutinized for possible applications to prevention and control . Investigations of host-parasite relations are of importance from the standpoint of personal hygiene since they furnish the knowledge necessary to protect the individual from protozoan infections . Of even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // the field of public health since whole communities may be protected as a result of these scientific investigations . In addition there is always before us the possibility of . throwing light on the greatest of all of our problems , that of the origin and evolution of parasitism . The materials available for observation and experiment are particularly favorable for attacks on this problem , and as an added incentive is the knowledge that the elucidation of the changes that occur during the development of the parasitic from the free-living habit may furnish the key to the solution of the problem of the method of evolution . // INTESTINAL AMG BCE i . Generic Characteristics Practically all protozo6logists agree that there are at least six " good " species of amoebae that are natural parasites of man . Besides these there are a number of doubtful species that have been described from man but about which there is as yet no general agreement . The six good species are illustrated in Figs. 1-6 . They have been placed in four genera although there is still some doubt about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes to become informed regarding the classification of the parasitic amoebae should consult the following books : Dobell ( igiga ) , Hegner and Taliaferro ( 1924 ) , and Wenyon ( 1926 ) . Detailed accounts of the morphology and life histories of these amoebae are also to be found in these books , hence only a brief statement of their distinguishing characteristics will be included here . The structure of the nucleus is the most important criterion used in distinguishing the different genera . I. ENDAMMBA This genus possesses a spherical nucleus with a small karyosome of chromatin and a superficial layer of chromatin granules lying on the inside of the nuclear membrane . In fixed material a clear area is present around 56 INTESTINAL AMWB ? the karyosome and between this and the nuclear membrane is a network of linin fibers . 2 . ENDOLIMAX In this genus the nucleus is vesicular but not always spherical ; there is no layer of chromatin granules on the nuclear membrane ; the karyosome is large and irregular in shape and may consist of several portions attached to each other by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nuclear membrane. 3 . IODAMCBA The nucleus of this genus likewise has no chromatin granules on the nuclear membrane ; the single karyosome is very large and is surrounded by a layer of globules that do not stain as deeply as the karyosome ; often delicate linin fibers extend from the karyosome to the nuclear membrane. 4 . DIENTAMCBA This genus is characterized by the presence in the majority of specimens of two nuclei ; according to Jepps and Dobell ( igi8 ) 8o per cent are binucleate , whereas Kudo ( 1926 ) found only 12.2 per cent of 2000 specimens with two nuclei , and Craig ( 1926b ) reports 67 per cent of cultural forms of this type . The nuclei are spherical and the chromatin consists of several granules embedded in a matrix of plastin . Linin fibers may connect this mass with the nuclear membrane . Among the genera of amoebae that have been described from man but are not yet well established are Councilmania ( Kofoid and 5wezy , 1921 ) , Caudarmwba ( Faust , : 17 HOST-PARASITE RELATIONS : INTESTINAL PROTOZOA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swezy , 1924a , 1925a ) . II . Specific Characteristics I. ENDAMOiBA HISTOLYTICA Trophozoite . The active or trophozoite stage of E. histolytica ( Fig . Ia ) varies greatly in size but is usually from 20 ? to 30 ? in diameter . The size variations are due principally to two factors ( I ) growth following binary division and ( 2 ) heritably diverse size races . The clear ectoplasm around the periphery of the body may be distinguished from the more granular endoplasm ; and the pseudopodia , which are entirely of ectoplasm , are thin and blade-like and formed in an explosive manner . Within the cytoplasm are usually food vacuoles containing red blood cells , leucocytes or other tissue elements and a single nucleus , which , however , is rarely distinctly visible in the living specimens . The nuclear structure is revealed in fixed and stained preparations . The nucleus is of the endamoeba type ( see above ) ; it is from q ? to 7 ? in diameter ; is " poor " in chromatin ; and has a small centrally located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear membrane . Precystic stage . Before encysting , E. histolytica loses its food inclusions ; decreases in size ; becomes sluggish ; and rounds up . Elmassian in igo9 believed this stage to be a distinct species and gave to it the name Entamwba minuta . Frequently vacuoles containing glycogen and rod-like refractile ( chromatoid ) bodies appear before encystation occurs . // Cyst . A thin peripheral wall is secreted by the precystic organism thus forming a spherical body , the cyst ( Fig. ib ) , which ranges from 51 , to 201. t in diameter . Different size races are indicated by differences in the size of the cysts . The mature cyst contains 4 nuclei , each of which appears like that of the trophozoite , but cysts with 1 , 2 , and 3 nuclei are frequently passed . Often glycogen vacuoles and chromatoid bodies are present in young cysts , but these are usually absorbed later . Life-cycle . The life-cycle of E. histolytica appears to be very simple . Trophozoites occur in the large intestine in about io per cent of the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring about the formation of liver abscesses ; and rarely in the small intestine , brain , lungs , spleen and other parts of the body . A culture method of diagnosis of intestinal amoebae similar to that originated for intestinal flagellates by Hegner and Becker ( 1922 ) is advocated by Craig and St. John ( 1927 ) . These investigators have found the LockeSerum medium the best for this purpose . One microscopic preparation from each culture inoculated with fecal material from 71 individuals resulted in 39 positives or an incidence of 54.92 per cent . The various amoebae were found in the following percentages : Endama ba higtolytica , 15.49 per cent ; E. coli , 29.57 per cent ; Endolimax nana , 12.67 per cent ; and Iodamwba williamsi , 5.63 per cent . It remains to be proved that this method can , be employed successfully under field conditions as Hill ( 1926 ) has done for the diagnosis of intestinal flagellates . Reproduction of the trophozoite is by binary fission. // The character of the nuclear division of E. histolytica is of particular importance since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deformans and Hodgkin 's disease ( Kofoid , 1923 ) has been based largely on the mitotic figures found in certain of the cells . Dobell ( 1919a ) has described division in specimens obtained by sectioning tissues from freshly killed cats that had been experimentally infected . Ike was unable to satisfy himself that chromosomes were present . Kofoid and Swezy ( 1922a ) described mitosis in specimens of E. histolytica found in the bone marrow in arthritis deformans and later ( 1925b ) published a detailed account of this process in both trophozoites and cysts from human cases of amcebiasis . They recognize an " interphase with normal resting nucleus , the prophase in which the daughter centrosomes form and the chromosomes emerge and divide , the modified amphiaster in which the divided chromosomes assemble in the equatorial region of the spindle , the anaphase in which they migrate toward the poles , and the telophase in which the nucleus constricts into two which then return to the interphase " ( p. 333 ) . The nuclear membrane remains intact throughout . The number of chromosomes is six ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the anaphase . Then the nucleus constricts into two . They claim that mitosis in E. histolytica is in all essential particulars of the type normal to the parasitic Amcebida . Multiplication of the nucleus occurs within the cyst ; that this leads to an increase in the number of organisms seems probable from the work of Yorke and Adams ( 1926a ; see p. 66 ) . The quadrinucleated cysts no doubt 6o ENDAMO13A COLT excyst in the intestine and give rise to four young amoebae ( see p. 88 ) . Hyperparasitism . Both free-living and parasitic amoebae are sometimes parasitized by other organisms . One of these , a vegetable organism of the genus Sphwrita , is known to invade the intestinal amoebae of man . How destructive it is to its host , and whether it plays a significant role in control , are points on which we have no evidence . 2 . ENDAMWBA COLT Trophozoite . The trophozoite of this species ( Fig. 2a ) also varies greatly in size but averages larger than that of E. histolytica ; it ranges from about 18A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter . The ectoplasm is ? meager in amount and not sharply separated from the endoplasm ; the latter is very granular giving the organism a grayish appearance . Locomotion is sluggish and no rapidly forming ectoplasmic pseudopodia occur . Food vacuoles are usually abundant , containing bacteria and various materials from the intestinal contents , but ordinarily no red cells or other tissue elements . Cleft-like vacuoles sometimes appear . The nucleus is usually visible in the living organism ; it is larger and coarser than that of E. histolytica with a thicker membrane , more chromatin on the membrane and a larger karyosome eccentrically placed . Precystic stage . This resembles the similar stage of E. histolytica but averages larger . Cyst . The cysts ( Fig. 2b ) range from Toil to 30/ . L Or more in diameter , the usual size being between 15/1 and // 20 ? . The nuclei are 8 in number in the mature cyst , but cysts with I , 2 and 4 are commonly found and more rarely with 16 or more . Glycogen occurs in early stages in greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare in 8-nucleated cysts . Chromatoid bodies are often present especially in early stages ; they may resemble splintered glass or be filamentous . Life-cycle . This species has been found only in the large intestine of man and about 50 per cent of the general population is infected . The stages described above are the only ones known with certainty to occur . The trophozoite undergoes binary division during which the nucleus probably divides by mitosis . The cysts are supposed to give rise to 8 amcebulT on hatching . Nuclear division within the cyst has been described by Swezy ( 1922 ) as mitotic involving the formation of probably six chromosomes . 3 . ENDAMEBA GINGIVALIS Trophozoite . The trophozoites of E. gingivalis ( Fig. 5 ) range from 6 ? to 6o ? in diameter but are rarely over 2o ? . The clear ectoplasm is distinct from the granular endoplasm and locomotion is fairly active . Kofoid and Swezy ( 1924c ) describe a distinct pellicle . The nucleus is of the endamceba type , smaller than that of E. coli , and with a karyosome either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leucocytes , etc. ; red cells have rarely been reported in them . Life-cycle . So far as we know the life-cycle of this species contains only the trophozoite stage . The mouth is the normal habitat and although exact figures are not // available no doubt a large proportion of mankind is infected . The only method of reproduction is probably binary division of the trophozoites. 4 . ENDOLIMAX NANA Trophozoite . This is a comparatively small species , the trophozoite ( Fig. 3a ) measuring only 6 ? to I2 ? in diameter . It has clear , blunt pseudopodia but is usually sluggish . The food vacuoles contain bacteria and other food bodies . The nucleus is like that characteristic of the genus . Precystic stage . As in E. histolytica , the precystic stage loses its food bodies , but does not become much smaller than the adult trophozoite . Cyst . The cysts ( Fig. 3b ) are typically ovoidal but sometimes spherical or irregular in shape . They are from 8 ? to 1o ? in length and about 6 ? in breadth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with I , 2 , or 3 nuclei occur . No chromatoid bodies are present but diffuse glycogen masses may occur from the precystic to the 4-nucleate stage . Life-cycle . E. nana probably lives only in the large intestine of man and is present in about 25 per cent of the general population . Increases in number no doubt result from binary fission of trophozoites and from division of the 4-nucleated cyst into 4 uninucleate amcebulae when excystation occurs . 5 . IODAMcEBA WILLIAMSI Trophozoite . This is generally from 9A to 14A in diameter , although specimens have been reported that were smaller or larger ( Fig. 4a ) . There is no clear distinction // between ectoplasm and endoplasm . Locomotion is sluggish . The endoplasm is usually crowded with food vacuoles containing bacteria and intestinal debris but no red cells . The nucleus is like that characteristic of the genus . Precystic stage . As in other species the trophozoites before encysting lose their food vacuoles , but decrease very little in size . Cyst . The cysts ( Fig. 4b ) are spherical or irregular in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , averaging about 9 ? . They contain a single nucleus except on rare occasions when two are present . The karyosome of the nucleus lies on one side and the rest of the space is filled with globules . Large glycogen vacuoles are seldom absent from the cysts . No chromatoid bodies are present . Life-cycle . I odamceba williainsi inhabits the intestine of man and is present in about to per cent of the general population . Binary fission of the trophozoite has been reported but no other method of reproduction is known . 6 . DIENTAMcEBA FRAGILIS Trophozoite . This rare species ( Fig. 6 ) is only 3.5j. to 12 , u in diameter . It is active , has clearly defined ectoplasm and endoplasm and sends out leaflike , hyaline pseudopodia . Two nuclei with the characteristics already described are usually present although specimens with one nucleus are not uncommon . The food consists of bacteria and yeasts . Cyst . Only one observer has noted cysts ( Kofoid , 1923 ) . These " are spherical with glycogen vacuoles and small chromatoidal bodies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , but less than Ioo cases have been recorded . Its process of reproduction has not been described . III . Host-Parasite Relations between Man and Endamceba histolytica 1 . EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TRANSMISSION ( I ) INFECTIVE STAGE . The general idea regarding the infective stage of intestinal protozoa is expressed admirably by Dobell ( Dobell and O'Connor , 1921 ) in the following words , " Infection with any intestinal protozoon is , in nature , always acquired through the mouth , by swallowing a living cyst containing the resting form of the particular organism . In ordinary circumstances the free forms can not live outside the body for more than a very short time , and they die if swallowed ? in other words , they are non-infective " ( p. 6 ) . Are trophozoites capable of bringing about an in f ec . tion ? Just how long trophozoites of E. histolytica ordi , narily live in fecal material outside of the body is not known . Rivas ( 1926 ) reports that active specimens remained alive for over 24 hours in fecal material and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes and kept at a temperature of 5 ? C. At 22 ? C. they lived for at least several hours , at 370 C. for a shorter period and at 450 C. for only 5 minutes . It seems probable that trophozoites are seldom ingested by man in a living condition although this might happen under unusual circumstances . That they are not quickly killed by the digestive juices is indicated by an experiment of the writer // ( Hegner , 1926c ) . Trophozoites from an artificial culture were injected into the stomach of a guinea-pig . One hour later the pig was killed and the stomach and small intestine carefully examined . None were found in the stomach , but specimens alive and moving were recovered in the small intestine 6 , 12 , 20 , 26 , 28 , 34 , 38 , 44 , and 51 inches posterior to the stomach . Dobell and Laidlaw ( 1926b ) report that trophozoites of E. histolytica will withstand 0.2 per cent HCl for 30 minutes . Whether trophozoites could successfully pass through the stomach and small intestine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to infect human beings with them per os , nor has any one been able to infect lower animals by adding trophozoites to their food . Hence , although the trophozoites are more resistant than usually supposed , it seems probable that infections are never brought about in nature except by the ingestion of cysts . Are immature cysts infective ? Not all of the cysts passed are supposed to be infective . As noted above cysts may possess 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 nuclei when they escape from the body . One patient may pass mostly uninucleate or binucleate cysts at one time and quadrinucleate cysts at another time , and cysts passed by different ' hosts may differ with respect to their nuclear number . It is generally believed that only the quadrinucleate cysts are capable of infection , and that those with 1 , 2 or 3 nuclei do not continue development outside of the body , but soon die . Recently , Yorke and Adams ( 1926a ) have shown that nuclear division may occur when immature cysts are placed in artificial culture media . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowed // by a host may also continue their development ; if so , then all cysts may be infective regardless of the number of nuclei they contain . Viability of cysts outside of the body . Desiccation . From the public health viewpoint it is important to know how long cysts remain viable outside of the body under various conditions . In the first place moisture is necessary for long-continued existence , since cysts , although provided with a resistant wall , are really very delicate and soon perish if dried . Thus Kuenen and Swellengrebel ( 1913 ) found that desiccation killed the cysts instantly , a result confirmed by Wenyon and O'Connor ( 1917 ) both for cysts allowed to dry in fecal material in the laboratory and for cysts contained in the dried droppings of flies that had fed on infected stools . The distribution of viable cysts in a dried condition in dust is therefore impossible . The dispersion of cysts in nature . Most cysts in nature remain in the raw feces in latrines until they die or are carried away by flies and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are destroyed by desiccation , are carried away by animals , or are washed into the soil or into ponds and streams by the rain . Boeck ( 1924a ) recovered E. histolytica cysts from lo of 201 privies examined in one of our Southern cities . The viability of cysts in raw and diluted feces thus becomes an important public health subject . Another very important point is the possibility and probability of their dissemination by flies and other animals . Tests of the viability of cysts . Some method of determining whether or not cysts are alive is the first requisite // for a study of their viability . The eosin test has been used for this purpose more than any other . Kuenen and Swellengrebel ( 1913 ) were the first to use this method to determine whether cysts are alive or dead . Eosin in a concentration of I : 1000 appeared to penetrate and stain dead cysts but not those that were alive . Later work by Wenyon and O'Connor ( 1917 ) , Cutler ( 1920 ) , Yoshida ( 1920 ) , Root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bercovitz ( 1924 ) , Kessel ( 1925b ) and others indicates that this test is not infallible ; dead cysts are usually stained but some of them are not . Bercovitz ( 1924 ) , for example , found that cysts of Endama'ba coli that were killed by chemicals did not , as a rule , take the eosin stain , and on this account , employs hmmatoxylin as a stain and cytological changes as a criterion of death . Boeck ( 1921 ) and Kessel ( 1925b ) showed that cysts that have undergone plasmolysis do not become stained and Kessel was able to prove that neither stained cysts nor the plasmolyzed cysts of Hartmannella hyalina excyst in culture medium , whereas most of the " green " ( viable ) cysts do . Root ( 1921 ) found neutral red more satisfactory than eosin since it stained a larger proportion of the cysts . Congo red has also been experimented with by Bercovitz ( 1924 ) . The best method of determining whether cysts are alive or dead is to test them in susceptible animals or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Boeck and Drbohlav ( 1925a , 1925b ) and others , and excystation may be brought about in the test tube , it will be possible to obtain more definite results than heretofore regarding the longevity of cysts outside of // the body under various conditions , and the effects of temperature , disinfectants , etc. , on them . Viability of cysts when tested on animals and in artificial culture . Data on the longevity of amoeba cysts have been furnished by various investigators . Walker and Sellards ( 1913 ) infected men with cysts of E. histolytica after they had been outside the body in fecal material for two days at tropical temperature , and with cysts of E. coli after 10 days under similar conditions . Experiments of Sellards and Theiler ( 1924 ) with kittens indicate that cysts are still infective after six days when left in the original stool at 2 ? C. but lose their infectiveness after two weeks . Cysts of E. histolytica that were io days old and had been kept in an ice box in the original stool for 8 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to excyst when incubated in culture medium . And Dobell and Laidlaw ( 1926b ) discovered that cysts will not excyst in culture until they have been held outside of the host 's body at a lower temperature for two days . Viability of cysts when tested with eosin , etc . Some of the results obtained with the . eosin test are as follows . Kuenen and Swellengrebel ( 1913 ) found that some histolytica cysts lived for over 7 days in water containing many bacteria and for at least 29 days in water containing few bacteria ; Penf old , Woodcock and Drew ( 1916 ) kept cysts alive in slowly running water for 15 days ; Thomson and Thomson ( 1916a ) observed living cysts in formed , moist feces 16 days after they were passed , and state that they can live considerably over a month // in feces that are kept moist and for weeks in feces diluted with drinking water . Wenyon and O'Connor ( 1917 ) record cysts still alive in diluted fecal material at the end of a month ; and Dobell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks in feces that are kept moist and cool and for five weeks if placed in water . A comprehensive experimental study of this subject was carried out by Boeck ( 1921b ) . Washed cysts of E. histolytica when kept in bottles in distilled water at 12 ? to 22 ? C. were still viable at the end of 153 days , and those of E. coil at the end of 244 days ; cysts of E. histolytica in eosin-stained wet preparations under a cover glass sealed with vaseline were still unstained after 211 days and those of E. coil after 124 days . Yorke and Adams ( 1926b ) were able to obtain cultures from cysts that had remained in raw feces at room temperature for 9 days , in washed suspensions at room temperature for io days , and in saline or water at o ? C. for 17 days . Conclusions from viability tests . These results indicate that when kept moist the cysts of these amcebm remain alive for long periods outside of the body . They live longer in water than in fecal material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infected feces is favorable for the continued existence of the cysts . Cysts that reach drinking water or water used for washing vegetables , etc. , or milk or moist food are thus in a comparatively advantageous position both as regards length of life and the chances of being ingested by a susceptible human being . Resistance of cysts to temperature . Very few of the factors encountered by cysts outside of the body have // been studied . We know something , however , about the effects of temperature on the cysts of E. histolytica and E. coli . As noted above cysts remain alive for a considerable period at room temperature in both the tropics and temperate zones and when stored at 2 ? C. Boeck ( 1921a ) attempted to find the upper temperature limit with the aid of the eosin test . He found that all cysts of E. histolytica were killed at 68 ? C. , of E. coli at 76 ? C. , of Endolimax nana at 64 ? C. , and of Iodantrccba williamsi at 64 ? C. ; many of the cysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperatures recorded are not ordinarily encountered in nature , but Boeck held cysts at these temperatures for only 5 minutes , whereas in nature high temperatures often continue for long periods and it is well known that organisms can withstand a certain temperature for a short time that would destroy them if maintained for a longer period . Yorke and Adams ( 1926b ) found that cysts would withstand a temperature of 45 ? C. for 30 minutes but were all killed in 5 minutes at 5o ? C. The possibility of destroying parasites in night soil by means of the heat from the sun has recently been discussed by Barnes ( 1925 ) who obtained temperatures of over 6o ? C. in glass-covered de Saussure boxes over a continuous period of at least 4 hours ( i i : oo A. M. to 3:00 P. M. ) . Such a temperature would doubtless be fatal to all protozoan cysts and the method suggested by Barnes might therefore be employed to prevent the spread of intestinal protozoa where night soil is used as fertilizer . Resistance of cysts to chemicals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cysts , 7 I HOST-PARASITE RELATIONS : INTESTINAL PROTOZOA but no comprehensive study of this subject has been made . Kuenen and Swellengrebel ( 1913 ) found that mercuric chloride , i in I000 , killed histolytica cysts in 4 hours ; that cresol , I in 250 , killed them in from 5 to 10 minutes ; but that formalin , lo per cent , does not destroy them if allowed to act only a few minutes . Emetin , i in zoo , was not fatal to some cysts when allowed to act for an hour . Cresol , 1 in 2o , was found by Wenyon and O'Connor ( 1917 ) to kill histolytica cysts immediately ; in one minute , in a strength of I in 30 ; in half an hour , in 1 in Ioo ; in one hour , 1 in 200 ; but not at all in a strength of I in 2,000 . They consider cresol the best disinfecting agent for dysenteric stools and for the hands of those who are exposed to contamination . These authors record the death of cysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in 7 hours , 1 in Too ; but state that some cysts were still alive after 8.5 hours , I in 200 . Eosin failed to stain cysts subjected to formalin , i in Too , for 4 hours , although the cysts appeared shrunken and distorted . Acid sodium sulphate in tablet form and chlorinated lime tabloids as used for the purification of water had no effect on the cysts , hence drinking water thus treated is not freed from any infective cysts that may be present . Bercovitz ( 1924 ) treated cysts of Endamceba coif , and Councilrnania lafleuri with many of the most common disinfectants and then stained them with hematoxylin to determine whether changes of a lethal nature had occurred . Cysts were placed in vials containing the disinfectant and allowed to remain there for periods of 15 seconds , 15 minutes and one hour . All agents used seemed to kill the cysts within an hour . HC1 , i per cent , killed // them in 15 minutes or less ; formalin i per cent , destroyed them ; in sodium hydroxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment with chlorinated lime , per cent , bichloride of mercury , i per cent , and carbolic acid ; and lysol , i per cent , killed quickly not only cysts of E. col ? , and C. lafleuri but also those of E. histolytica . The conclusion seems justified that these various disinfectants are powerful destructive agents for amoeba cysts ; and it seems probable that those of E. histolytica are at least as susceptible as are the cysts of the two species principally studied . As Bercovitz suggests , however , culture experiments in addition to the eosin and hematoxylin tests , are necessary to prove that the cysts were really destroyed . The culture method was employed by Kessel ( 1925b ) in his study of the effects of chlorin water on cysts of Hartmannella hyalina . No excystation occurred in cultures within 72 hours after the cysts had been subjected for io minutes to chlorin water containing free chlorin of from 2.2 to 4.0 per cent , and very few cases of excystation were noted until a dilution of 0.4 per cent was reached . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chlorin water for 24 hours , and none in 0.15 , 0.1 , and o.o8 per cent chlorin water for 48 hours . Cysts did not hatch after 96 hours in o.o6 per cent chlorin water , but a few excysted in 0.009 per cent and many in o.006 per cent chlorin water . The culture method was also used by Yorke and Adams ( 1926b ) in their studies of E. histolytica . The cysts were subjected to the chemical and then washed and placed in culture medium . They found them very // resistant to yatren and emetin ; they withstood 5 per cent HC1 for 30 minutes , but were not very resistant to various disinfectants . Conclusions regarding the disinfection of feces , milk , and drinking water . As a result of these various experiments we may conclude that a simple method of disinfecting feces containing histolytica cysts is available , namely , the use of cresol in a strength of I in 20 , but that no practical method has yet been discovered of . sterilizing drinking water . The pasteurization of milk probably raises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. ) for a sufficient time to destroy any protozoan cysts present and of course the boiling of water would quickly kill all cysts. 2 . AVENUE OF INFECTION . How ' do living cysts of E. histolytica reach the digestive tract of man ? There is only one conceivable method of entrance , in nature , and that is by way of the mouth . It seems probable that they usually reach the mouth in contaminated food and drink but they might also find their way there on soiled hands . Among the most important factors that bring about the dissemination of cysts , and especially their presence in food and drink , are probably the handling of food in homes , restaurants , hotels and markets by infected persons who are passing cysts ; the use of night soil as fertilizer in vegetable gardens ; the common use of toilet , washbowl , and towel ; and the presence of insects , such as flies , ants and cockroaches , and of domestic animals , such as rats , mice , dogs and cats . The dissemination of cysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dissemination of histolytica and // other protozoan cysts has been recognized for many years . As long ago as 1913 Stiles and Keister recovered giardia cysts from flies that had been fed on fecal matter containing cysts of this flagellate . Kuenen and Swellengrebel ( 1913 ) did not find cysts in or upon flies that were allowed access for 48 hours to fecal matter containing histolytica cysts ; , and cysts that were present on the outside of flies that they soiled with infected material soon died because of dessication ; they therefore concluded that flies are unimportant carriers . Several years later , however , Thomson and Thomson ( 1916b ) noted that flies may ingest cysts and deposit them in their feces . A number of interesting and important experiments were conducted by Wenyon and O'Connor ( 1917 ) with flies belonging to several genera . They found that a fly that had not fed for 2 or 3 hours could ingest one milligram of feces in half an hour ; Root ( 1921 ) records a larger capacity , a single house fly ( Musca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow fly ( Calliphora erythrocephala ) 0.022 cc. after being without food for from 17 to 21 hours . Flies are thus able to ingest a large number of cysts at a single meal . With the use of the eosin test , Wenyon and O'Connor found that cysts are not killed by conditions in the fly 's digestive tract , but may remain alive there for as long as 24 hours , and that the fly may deposit living cysts in its feces from 5 minutes to at least 16 hours after feeding . Of particular interest is their discovery that 18 of 229 wild flies captured in a hospital compound passed cysts or eggs of parasites in their feces ; of these , 6 deposited coli cysts and 5 histolytica cysts . Cysts were not found in material // regurgitated by flies that had fed on infected fecal matter . Roubaud 's ( 1918 ) data confirm certain of these results . He found viable histolytica and coli cysts in flies ' feces for over 24 hours but only rarely after 40 hours . Cysts in drowned flies lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the flies decomposed sufficiently to liberate them , which requires a month or more . Similar experiments were carried out by Root ( 1921 ) who found that half of the histolytica cysts ingested by house flies and blow flies were dead after 15 hours and that some of the cysts lived at least 49 hours . In Mesopotamia wild house flies were found by Buxton ( 1920 ) to be carriers of parasites that occur in human feces . Flies were collected from Arab compounds , Indian latrines and incinerators , and British mess and cook houses . The dissection of 1,027 flies revealed that 63 per cent had apparently ingested human feces ; that 4.09 per cent contained human intestinal parasites ; and that 0.3 per cent contained cysts of E. histolytica . Cysts of E. coil and Giardia lamblia were also found in the flies . Not all experiments with flies have been as successful as those described above . Jausion and Dekester ( 1923b ) , working at Fez , fed 40 flies on stools containing cysts and trophozoites of E. histolytica but recovered only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preservation . No amoba were found in seventy-three flies caught in the laboratory and in the latrines at a time when 23 per cent of the inhabitants were infected . The injection into the rectum of a young cat of 50 flies that were caught in the latrines did not result in an infection . The con- // clusion reached by these investigators is that flies play a very small role in the transmission of intestinal amcebe . A similar attempt to infect kittens with flies that had fed on fecal matter containing histolytica cysts had previously been made by Wenyon and O'Connor ( 1917 ) , Flies were fed by them to two kittens but no infections resulted . The data available seem to prove conclusively that flies both in the laboratory and in nature ingest fecal material containing protozoan cysts ; that the cysts are not quickly killed in the flies ' intestine ; that living cysts may be deposited in the feces of the fly from 5 minutes to 49 hours after feeding ; and that these cysts may be deposited in the food or drink of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host . The conclusion seems inevitable that flies play an important role in the dissemination of histolytica cysts and that food and drink should be protected from their visits , especially in localities where amoebic dysentery occurs and sanitary conditions are such as to allow flies access to infected fecal matter . It may be pointed out here that the fly does not become infected but is a " passive " carrier , in contrast to the rat described below which is an " active " carrier . The dissemination of cysts by other animals . Under favorable circumstances other insects , such as ants and cockroaches , and even other animals , may serve as distributors of protozoan cysts . Several investigators have incriminated rats and mice . The data furnished by Lynch ( 1915b ) on spontaneous and experimental infections with E. histolytica in rats in South Carolina can not be // accepted at their face value since he did not take into account the fact that rats are naturally infected with other species of amoebae . Brug ( 1919a ) noted what were apparently infections with E. histolytica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been successful in infecting a specimen of Mus rattus . Kartulis ( 1891 ) also reported spontaneous infection in rats . The most successful experimental infections in rats and mice are those described by Kessel ( 1923 ) . Rats were fed human feces containing histolytica cysts ; 8 of 29 specimens became infected . The infection was of the chronic type ; cysts were passed in the feces ; and other rats were infected by feeding them these cysts . One of io mice was also infected by ingesting histolytica cysts ; this mouse passed cysts in its feces . Rats and mice , according to Kessel 's results , not only may become infected and pass cysts , but histolytica cysts may pass through their digestive tract and appear in their feces in a viable condition . The fecal pellets of such animals might bring about the contamination of food or drink and hence infection in any susceptible human host . However , it seems probable that infection is very seldom spread in this way , even if Kessel 's results should be confirmed by other investigators . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as cats and dogs , with E. histolytica ( see p. 113 ) . Cysts may pass through the digestive tract of the cat unharmed ( Dobell , I919a ) but since infected dogs and cats do not ordinarily pass cysts these animals play a minor role , if any , in the transmission of intestinal amoebae . The activity of the host and passivity of the parasite in transmission . An important fact that has been brought // out by studies on the transmission of protozoan cysts is that the host is entirely responsible for his own infection . The parasite remains passive and can only reach the intestine of a new host by the activities of the host . The discussion of the methods of protecting individuals and communities from infection is reserved until later ( see p. 116 ) . Transmission as a result of association with carriers . The principal reservoirs of E. histolytica are human carriers who are passing cysts . Observations indicate that the association of such carriers with susceptible hosts result in infections . For example , Kofoid ( 1923 ) emphasizes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lepine ( 1924 ) noted that 5o per cent of indigenous cases of amcebiasis near Lyons , France , had associated with colonial troops during the war . The migration of troops to France and their return to the United States furnished an excellent opportunity to study this subject . Stiles ( 1922 ) summarized the results of a very extensive study by Boeck and himself ( Boeck and Stiles , 1923 ) in part as follows . Examinations were made of 13,043 specimens from 8,029 persons in 22 states and D. C. 44 per cent ( 3533 ) were infected with both protozoa and worms . 39.9 per cent ( 3,208 ) were infected with protozoa. 9.6 per cent ( 775 ) were infected with worms . 4.1 per cent ( 333 ) were infected with E. histolytica . Positive cases were found in persons from every state that sent in a fair number of specimens . These data give // a very adequate idea of the incidence of infection on the basis of one or two examinations of each person . The results of the examinations of the soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soldiers that did not go to Europe ( 1.3 examinations each ) . 2584 individuals , 93 positive = 3.5 per cent positive . Soldiers after their return from Europe ( 1 . I examinations each ) . 3536 individuals , TOO positive = 2.8 per cent positive . Soldiers of unknown military history ( 1.5 examinations each ) . 362 individuals , 11 positive = 3.0 per cent positive . These results indicate that soldiers who may have come into contact with other soldiers , some of whom had come from the tropics , were no more frequently infected than those who remained in the United States . An attempt was also made to determine by means of questionnaires whether the return of about 3,000,000 soldiers from overseas had had any effect upon the number of cases of clinical amcebiasis . The data are as follows ( Stiles , 1922 ) : Letters of enquiry were sent to 607 hospitals and I15 medical schools . Replies were received from 468 hospitals and 71 medical schools , representing all but 4 states . 190 negative replies were received from 28 states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive replies , were received from 13 other states . Three states gave negative or indefinite replies . 8o E. HISTOLYTICA : CLIMATE Total ? 532 replies from 44 state ; 24 or 4.5 per cent reported increase but not serious . The conclusion reached was that the increase in clinical amcebiasis , if any really occurred , was not serious enough to warrant the attempt to eliminate the carriers among the returned soldiers by treatment . Epidemics of amwbiasis . That clinical amoebiasis may exist in epidemic form is claimed by several writers . Thus Craig ( 1926a ) states that epidemics of amoebic dysentery occurred among the U. S. troops in the Philippine Islands during the Philippine Insurrection , and a series of cases reported by Voss ( 1925 ) indicate that the presence of carriers may bring about an epidemic of amcebiasis in a northern climate ( Norway ) even at an unfavorable time of the year ( the middle of winter ) . A young man contracted dysentery in Calcutta ; three or four months later he arrived at his home in Norway ; three days after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dysentery and died ; the day after the father 's death his nurse came down with dysentery . The relation between climate and infections with E. histolytica . Amcebiasis has for many years been included among the tropical diseases because of the great number of acute cases that occur in the tropics- as compared with the temperate regions ; but surveys have within the past decade been made in almost all parts of the world and we now know that infection of man with E. histolytica is much more common than generally supposed and exists throughout the entire globe . There may be local areas that are free from it but these have not yet been circumscribed . The incidence of infection varies in differ- // ent regions ; it appears to be greater in the tropics than in the temperate zone but not enough greater to account for the much larger number of clinical cases encountered in the tropics . A fair estimate from all the data available indicates an average rate of infection throughout the world of about lo per cent . Three principal solutions have been offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropics . One is climate , another , lack of sanitation , and the third , more virulent strains . Brug ( 1925 ) has attempted to establish climate as the responsible factor . Jaeger ( 1902 ) reported epidemics of amoebic dysentery in Konigsberg during August to October 1900 , and August to September 1901 ; Brug found the greatest number of cases in 1900 to 1901 in the E. Asiatic Expeditionary Corps to be in the late summer ; Viereck ( 1907 ) records amcebiasis as most abundant at Hamburg in 1900 to 1905 in July and August ; Woodcock ( 1918 ) , in the region of the Suez Canal , found August and September to be the two months when amcebic dysentery was most prevalent ; Jouveau-Dubreuil ( 1919 ) in Setchouan , China , reports the highest incidence of the disease from July to September ; Ledingham ( 1920 ) found amcebic dysentery most abundant in Mesopotamia during the hotter months ; Vallardi ( 1920 ) recorded 840 of 1,671 cases among the Italian Expeditionary Corps in Macedonia in July ; Garin and Lepine ( 1924 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most frequent in June and July , and September and October ; and Scott ( 1924 ) , in Tientsin , noted that fresh cases of amoebic dysentery are rare in winter . Brug adds to these // reports data obtained by him in tropical Batavia in 1917 to 1924 ; these indicate August , October and November as the months of greatest incidence . The conclusion reached is that climate is responsible for the change from the carrier condition to that of acute dysentery and that the greater incidence of clinical amcebiasis in the tropics is explained by the fact that hot weather is favorable and colder weather unfavorable for the production of symptoms . Just how differences in temperature operate to bring about these results is not indicated . 2 . PARASITOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL PERIODS The prepatent period . Usually the exact time when infective cysts were ingested by persons infected with E. histolytica is not known . On this account we must depend on the very few human experiments that have been reported and on animal experiments for our data . The best work on human beings is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Specimens , mostly cysts , in gelatine capsules , were fed to 20 different persons whose stools had previously been found to be free from this species . These men were then kept under observation for periods of time ranging from 2 months to one year ? 14 for the latter period . Eighteen of the 20 became infected ; no specimens were recovered from the other two during the year following the initiation of the experiment . The prepatent periods of those who became infected were as follows : in 2 cases , I day ; in 2 cases , 2 days ; in 1 case , 3 days ; in 4 cases , 4 days ; in 3 cases , 5 days ; in I case , 8 days ; in 2 cases , I I days ; in I case , 21 days ; in I case , 33 days ; and in 1 case , 44 days . The shortness of the // prepatent period is surprising ; it suggests that some of the specimens noted on the first and second days after ingestion might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offspring of the original specimens that had succeeded in establishing themselves in the intestine . The patent period . In all cases specimens were passed from the time they first appeared to the termination of the experiments . The duration of the patent period was therefore at least as long as the patients were kept under observation . The incubation period . Only 4 of the 18 positives suffered from dysenteric symptoms , the incubation periods being 20 , 57 , 87 , and 95 days in length . The other 14 positives may , however , have exhibited symptoms after observations ceased . The carrier period . Apparently all persons infected with E. histolytica become carriers ; those who never exhibit symptoms are " contact " carriers according to Walker 's terminology , and those who pass cysts after suffering from dysentery are " convalescent " carriers . Unless rid of their ameebae by the aid of drugs , carriers remain infected for many years . During this time they are always in danger of a disturbance in the equilibrium between host and parasite which will bring about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers , would constitute a relapse . The incubation period in cats . Infections with E. histolytica from man have been obtained by many investigators in kittens . The course of the infection in this host is very different from that in man . The infected cat exhibits symptoms , but does not pass cysts and hence does // not become a carrier . Dale and Dobell ( 1917 ) state that the incubation period lasts about two weeks if cysts are fed to kittens but averages only about two days if infections are brought about by rectal injections of motile specimens . Wagener ( 1924 ) records the incubation period in kittens , following rectal injections , as from 2 to 5 days and in adult cats as at least one week . 3 . DISTRIBUTION AND LOCALIZATION WITHIN THE HOST Cysts are passively carried to the primary site of infection . Natural infections with E. histolytica are brought about by the ingestion of infective cysts , although under extraordinary circumstances ( see p. 65 ) it is possible that trophozoites may be responsible for an infection . Cysts have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might anchor them to the wall of the digestive tract , hence they are carried along passively with the food that is swallowed . Since the primary site of infection is the large intestine , they must pass through the stomach and small intestine in a living condition . Food is known to pass through the small intestine of man in about 4 hours ; hence the cysts may reach the large intestine in this length of time . If the contents of the large intestine are not well formed , that is , if the bowels are loose , many of the cysts and trophozoites ( if excystation has taken place ) may be carried directly out of the body . As Dobell and Low ( 1922 ) have pointed out , infection is most frequent in those parts of the intestine where stasis occurs ; and Sellards and Theiler ( 1924 ) have emphasized the fact that stasis is an important condition in experimental infections in kittens . Trophozoites // that succeed in escaping f rom cysts and that find suitable conditions in the large intestine may start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are responsible ? The conditions that bring about excystation are not well known and no one has yet determined exactly where it occurs in the human host . It is generally believed that cysts do not hatch outside of the body and Dobell ( Dobell and O'Connor , 1921 ) goes so far as to state that " cysts never hatch in the colon , where they are formed , or outside the body . " Darling ( 1913 ) , however , as pointed out by Yorke and Adams ( 1926a ) , noted the disappearance of cysts and the appearance of trophozoites in feces containing histolytica cysts that were kept in a moist chamber . It is not at all certain that the trophozoites observed came from the cysts since amoebae of other species often appear in fecal material kept under similar conditions . Excystation in laboratory animals . Several investigators have attempted to study excystation by feeding cysts to laboratory animals and then killing the animals after intervals of various lengths and examining the cysts present in various parts of the intestine . Dobell ( 19iga ) had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) observed what he considered to be excystation of cysts fed to cats . In the stomach the chromatoid bodies disappeared from the cysts but no hatching occurred . Excystation took place , however , in the small intestine . A single quadrinucleate amoeba emerged from each cyst . These amcebw ingested bacteria ; their cytoplasm became vacuolated ; and their nuclei clumped together . // The effects of digestive juices on cysts outside of the body . Other investigators have treated cysts outside of the body with various substances . For example , Ujihara ( 1914 ) found that pancreatic juice acted upon the cyst wall but not gastric juice at 37 ? C. for 24 hours ; Penfold , Woodcock and Drew ( 1916 ) also found pancreatic extract effective but had no success with either pepsin in an acid medium , or bile . Cutler ( 1919b ) records excystation after the action of liquor pepticus followed by liquor pancreaticus . The trophozoites that emerged possessed four nuclei but were supposed to divide later into 4 uninucleate amoeboe . Excystation in artificial culture . The perfection of methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drbohlav ( 1925a , 1925b ) and others has made it possible to study excystation under more favorable conditions . Boeck and Drbohlav report what seemed to be a case of excystation in one of their cultures and St. John ( 1926 ) states that he obtained trophozoites in cultures from a stool that was 10 days old and had been in the icebox for 8 days ; this material must have been f ree f roan trophozoites . No observations were recorded by these investigators on the hatching of the cysts . Yorke and Adams ( 1926a ) and Dobell and Laidlaw ( 1926b ) have published more extensive studies on excystation in cultures . Yorke and Adams found that uninucleate and binucleate cysts continued to develop in Locke-egg-serum medium when incubated at 37 ? C. For example , material containing 42 per cent uninucleate , 18 per cent binucleate // and 27 per cent quadrinucleate cysts at the time cultures were made had changed of ter 2.5 hours to 8 per cent uninucleate , 9 per cent binucleate and 75 per cent quadrinucleate cysts . This indicates that development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary to the general belief at present . The glycogen , which occurred in most of the uninucleate cysts , disappeared in the cultures , and chromatoid bodies , which were rare in the uninculeate cysts , increased during the first few hours of cultivation but decreased again later as trophozoites began to appear . It was noted by Dobell ( Dobell and O'Connor , 1921 ) that cysts when kept outside of the body in moist f eves or water gradually lose their glycogen and chromatoid bodies . Yorke and Adams describe excystation in the following words . " An individual which is about to excyst presents a characteristic appearance . The cytoplasm is more or less homogeneous and appears to be of a faintlygreenish tint , and is frequently very finely-alveolar ; the nuclei in the living individual can be distinguished only with the greatest difficulty . Careful examination shows that the amoeba is retracted in places f rom the cyst envelope and is evidently loose inside it ; f rom time to time vigorous pseudopodia ) movements can he seen to take place . Finally a rent apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ectoplasm is protruded ; this progressively enlarges in a spasmodic manner , more and more of the amoeba protruding from the envelope , until finally the creature has escaped completely . It then proceeds to move about in an active , usually slug-like manner , frequently drawing behind it the empty cyst envelope // or faecal debris . . . . Although at the moment of emergence the cytoplasm is either practically homogeneous or , at most , very finely alveolar , with minute granules , it quickly becomes definitely alveolar , and as it ingests bacteria digestive vacuoles appear in large numbers . " Yorke and Adams also found that cysts would develop at 37 ? C. and excyst in Locke-serum medium , broth , and physiological saline and would develop even in water at 37 ? C. up to the rupture of the cyst wall , but that in water the amoeba is killed either before , during , or immediately after its escape . They conclude that " moisture and a suitable temperature ( preferably about 37 ? C. ) are essential for the occurrence of excystation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pepticus or liquor pancreaticus is unnecessary for excystation . " A similar conclusion was reached by Sellards and Theiler ( 1924 ) from experiments with histolytica cysts in kittens ; they state that " For the excystation of amoebae , a suitable temperature and a reasonable supply of water are obvious necessities . " Dobell and Laidlaw ( 1926b ) bring out the interesting fact that histolytica cysts which have formed in culture or have been freshly passed by human or simian hosts are incapable of excysting in cultures until they have been cooled below body temperature for one or two days . When kept cool they retain their ability to hatch for approximately two weeks . Autogamy , gamete formation and the production of amwbula ? . The evidence at present available indicates that the amoeba escapes from the cyst in a quadrinucleate condition , the nuclei being closely agglomerated . Autog- // amy within the cyst as described in E. coli by Schaudinn ( 1903 ) , and in E. muris by Wenyon ( 1907 ) probably does not occur . In fact Wenyon ( 1926 ) states that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs in the development of the cysts of any entamceba . " Recent work also seems to disprove the observation of Darling ( 1913 ) that four uninucleate amoebulae are formed within the cyst before hatching ; of Yoshida ( 1920 ) that the fusion of nuclei occurs after excystation ( in E. tetragena and E. coli ) ; and of Mathis and Mercier ( 1917 ) that eight-nucleated cysts produce uninucleate gametes that conjugate in pairs . Yorke and Adams have shown by careful experiments that in culture the young quadrinucleate amoeba usually either divides into two binucleate animals and these subsequently into unincleate forms , or uninucleate amoebulac separate one by one from the quadrinucleate animal . Their cultures inoculated with cysts gave for example at the end of 6.5 hours i9 per cent of ammbT with 4 nuclei , I per cent with 3 , and 5 per cent with 2 , the rest of the original cysts being still unhatched ; whereas at the end of 24 hours there were 3 per cent with 4 nuclei , I per cent with 3 , 14 per cent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent with many , and 2 per cent still in the cyst stage . The detailed statistics show a gradual change from quadrinucleate to uninucleate forms . Multinucleate specimens were of frequent occurrence ( up to 24 per cent ) indicating that nuclear division without cell division sometimes takes place in quadrinucleate amoebae after hatching . In what part of the digestive tract does excystation take place ? The data presented above dispose effectively 9o E. HISTOLYTICA : EXCYSTATION of the general belief that cysts must be subjected to the digestive juices in the stomach and small intestine before they will hatch . The idea that cysts hatch in the small intestine and not in the large intestine is also coming under suspicion . Kessel ( 1923 ) , for example , found trophozoites of E. histolytica most commonly in the cecum and none in the small intestine of rats that were fed cysts of this species . Only once were they encountered in the colon . He concludes from this that excystation occurs in the cecum of this animal . As regards hatching in the colon , Sellards and Theiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1914b ) , have shown that histolytica cysts injected into the large intestine of kittens will excyst there provided stasis is produced . and Hoare ( 1925 ) found amceb2e in the intestinal mucosa of a kitten that had been injected rectally with material containing cysts only of E. histolytica . Drbohlav ( Wenyon , 1926 ) has also noted the hatching of cysts in the large intestine of kittens . Presumably excystation may also take place in the large intestine of man . Sellards and Theiler ( 1924 ) have gone even further and suggest that cysts may hatch in the colon of the same individual in which they are formed . Relapse in ameebiasis may , according to this view , result from the hatching of resistant cysts held for long periods in the intestine . However , the observation of Dobell and Laidlaw ( 1926b ) that cysts must be cooled below body temperature for several days before they will hatch indicates that cysts could not hatch until they had passed out of the body of the host in which they encysted. // 4 . THE PRIMARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of infection with E. histolytica . This is an excellent location for the parasite since escape from the body of the host , which is of great importance for the maintenance of the race , is easy from this habitat . Access to the tissues of the wall was for many years considered necessary since the amoebae were supposed to live only on tissue elements , but the discovery that they feed on bacteria in cultures suggests that they are able to exist in the lumen of the intestine or on the outside of its wall . Those trophozoites or cysts that become embedded in the fecal matter are carried out of the body , hence it seems probable that only those excysted amoebae that are able to reach the intestinal wall to which they can attach themselves are able to withstand the peristaltic movements of the bowel . These , therefore , are the specimens responsible for bringing about an infection . Experiments with E. histolytica on cats indicate that the primary site of infection is located in that part of the large intestine where stasis first occurs . Stasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gives them sufficient time to reach and anchor themselves to the wall of the intestine . Data regarding the location of ulcers in human cases of amcebiasis favor this hypothesis . Thus a resume of records of 6800 post-mortem examinations made in the Panama Canal Zone from 1905 to 1923 principally by Darling and Clark has been published by the latter ( Clark , 1924 ) . Of these , 186 died of amcebiasis or had amoebic ulcers // in their intestine ( in 27 cases ) . The ulcers were scattered throughout the colon in 113 cases ( 6o.77o ' ) but in 63 cases ( 33.870 ) were limited to certain regions . These regions are indicated in Fig. 20 ; they are dependent por tions where the greatest stasis exists , i.e. , the cecum , ascending colon , rectum , sigmoid and appendix . 5 . SECONDARY SITES OF INFECTION Infections in the i1cum . E. histolytica has been noted on several occasions anterior to the ileo-cecal valve . Cases have been reported in man by Harris ( 1898 ) , Kuenen ( 19o9 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig states // that he has " observed several cases in which typical amoebic ulcerations containing the ameebw were present in the lower portion of the ileum in the region just above the ileocaecal valve . " Sellards and Theiler ( 1924 ) working with cats found that in several of the older animals with histolytica infections of several weeks the amoebae spread into the small intestine above the ileo-colic sphincter . They found that by ligating the large intestine and then f orcing water into the digestive tract with a stomach tube they were able to cause the distension of the ileocolic sphincter . In 3 kittens thus treated the amoebae infected the lower part of the small intestine , this result suggesting that the sphincter ordinarily mechanically prevents the passage of the amoebae into the ileum . In 3 other kittens no infection was obtained when the ileum was ligated and trophozoites injected above the ligature . Why the wall of the ileum is not as readily attacked as that of the large intestine is not known . The distribution of amxbce to other parts of the body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histolytica have been noted besides the ileum ; many of these have been in parts of the body at a considerable distance from the large intestine and can be explained only on the assumption that amoebae are carried there in the blood or lymph . When an amoebic ulcer is formed in the wall of the large intestine blood vessels are opened , thus giving the amoebae access to the blood stream ; specimens have actually been observed in the capillaries of the intestinal wall . Such amoebae may obviously be carried to any part of the body and may initiate infections wherever suitable conditions are encountered . // Infections in the liver . The liver is the most frequent secondary site of infection , the amoebae gaining access to this organ by way of the portal vein and giving rise there to one or more abscesses . These abscesses are most often in the right lobe but may be situated in any part of the liver . Sometimes they are very large , containing over a gallon of pus . They may rupture into the lung or other neighboring regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigators have reported the percentage of liver abscesses in cases of intestinal amcebiasis . For example , Kartulis ( 1887 ) noted 55 per cent of 500 cases at autopsy ; Councilman and Lafleur ( 189 i ) record 21 cases among 1429 patients suffering from amoebic dysentery ; Craig ( 1911 ) noted 33 per cent of 78 cases at autopsy ; Clark ( 1924 ) records 51 per cent of 186 cases of intestinal amcebiasis that were autopsied in Panama between the years 1905 and 1923 ; and Ludlow ( 1926 ) reports the extremely high incidence of 11.2 per cent among Korean females . Other secondary sites of infection . Abscesses of amoebic origin may also occur in the lung , brain , spleen , etc . Pulmonary abscesses may be due to rupture of a liver abscess or to amoeba carried to the lungs in the circulation . The lower lobe of the right lung is the most common location . Abscesses in the lung may rupture into the air passages and the pus , containing amoebae , may be coughed up by the patient . AmoebT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which about 5o cases have been recorded , all ending fatally . Several cases of splenic abscess have been reported . Amoeba ; have also been reported from the urinary tract , the testis , the // skin , the eye , the bone marrow , and the lymph glands . Whether the " organisms " described in all of these cases were amoeba of the species E. histolytica and whether they were responsible for the various diseased conditions ascribed to them are questions that will be discussed later ( seep . Iog ) . 6 . CHANGES IN THE HOST DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF THE PARASITE ( I ) THE GENESIS OF SYMPTOMS . Human hosts of E. histolytica do not usually exhibit symptoms ; presumably the parasites in most cases do not interfere sufficiently with the normal functions of the body to bring about obvious changes . Occasionally , however , symptoms appear , their character depending on the location and severity of the lesions produced by the amoebae . Thus primary or intestinal amcebiasis may give rise to amoebic diarrhea or amoebic dysentery , and secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of amoebic abscesses in the lungs , brain and spleen , and of lesions in other parts of the body . The symptoms that result f rom the invasion of these organs are rather well known and are described in various books on protozoology and tropical medicine ( see p. 198 ) . The origin of the symptoms observed , however , is practically unknown . For example , the most common symptom of intestinal amcebiasis is diarrhea ; this is " abnormal frequency and liquidity of fecal discharges . " Two factors are involved here , ( I ) the exudation into the intestinal lumen of serous fluid with a tendency to putrefy and ( 2 ) an increase in peristaltic activity . Auer- // bach 's plexus is recognized as the center for intestinal peristalsis and its abnormal stimulation may be brought about in various ways . In the case of amoebic diarrhea the most probable stimulus is the irritation of the intestinal wall . If mild , such irritation would result in an increased production of mucus ; if more severe , a more copious transudation might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of symptoms due to amoebic invasion is , however , unknown , and hence it would be fruitless to elaborate the subject further in this place . The fact that the origin of symptoms in this and other protozoan diseases is open to experimental study and offers a fascinating field for investigation can not be too strongly emphasized . ( 2 ) PATHOGENESIS . As in the case of symptomatology , the pathology of amoebiasis has been described many times . Descriptions of the pathogenesis of amcebiasis are also available but these are based largely on assumptions ; it is easy to imagine what might take place but quite another thing to determine exactly the relations between the parasite and the host that result in a diseased condition . Probably some of the newly hatched amoebae succeed in reaching the wall of the large intestine to which they attach themselves by means of their pseudopodia , and thus escape being carried out of the body . The presence of only a few specimens would interfere extremely little with the functions of the intestinal wall , but large numbers of amoebae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epithelial surface in contact with the intestinal contents . The combined effects of large numbers of amoebae may thus become of suffi- // cient magnitude to be noticed by the host or his physician . It is well known that whether or not symptoms appear in many parasitic infections depends on the number of parasites present . Sections of the intestinal wall of both man and experimental animals infected with E. histolytica have revealed large numbers of amoebae in the glands of Lieberkuhn . Here again , functions may be disturbed merely by the presence of the parasites . Amoebae also invade the tissues of the intestinal wall . They ate supposed to do this by dissolving away the cells with the aid of a cytolytic ferment which they secrete or by pressure due to their rapid multiplication and the consequent blocking of the opening of the glands into which they have migrated . They do not appear to ingest red blood cells or other tissue elements while within the tissues . Continued multiplication of the amoebae and cellular destruction leads to the formation of a nodule which eventually bursts into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the amoebae that escape invade neighboring glands and repeat the process , thus spreading the infected area . At the same time , those that remain in the ulcer continue the destruction of the tissues at the sides and bottom . Further pathological effects result from a continuation of this process . These tissue-invading amoebae are large and never of the precystic type ; the latter , as well as cysts , occur only in the lumen of the intestine . What modifications occur in other parts of the body due to the formation of ulcers in the intestine are very little understood and their genesis unknown . Much of this story , as mentioned above , is based on // assumptions ; but the pathogenesis of amoebiasis is open to experimental study and not until properly conducted experiments have been carried out can we state definitely what actually occurs . We know even less about secondary amoebiasis than we do about amoebic infection of the intestine , and any attempt to describe its pathogenesis at present would be futile . 7 . RESISTANCE AND SUSCEPTIBILITY OF THE HOST The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptibility of the host to infection with E. histolytica is fragmentary and scattered and mostly based on experiments on animals . Some of the questions involved are as follows : Do the members of the various human races differ in resistance to infection and in severity of the symptoms ? Does the age of the host have an influence on susceptibility and the character of the disease ? Does an infection with E. histolytica or with some other parasite increase the resistance of the host to subsequent infection ? What relation exists between host resistance and the invasion of the tissues of the intestinal wall ? Does the character of the climate influence the resistance of the host or the aggressivity of the parasite or both ? What immunological reactions have been obtained by experiments with E. histolytica ? Racial differences . The influence of race upon susceptibility to amoebic infection is not very clear at present . Fletcher and Jepps ( 1924 ) found that Tamils are much more susceptible than Chinese to both E. histolytica and E. colt . The Tamils gave i9.i per cent and the Chinese 0.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per // cent and 1.7 per cent respectively with E. coll . Interesting comparisons between Chinese and foreigners as regards susceptibility to infection with E. histolytica and with respect to the severity of the infections have been provided by Kessel and Svensson ( 1924 ) and Kessel and Wiliner ( 1925 ) . A survey in Peking by the former showed that infection in Chinese ( 29.5 per cent ) was considerably greater with this species than in foreigners ( 16.5 per cent ) . Kessel and Wiliner ( 1925 ) report a careful study of i800 patients admitted to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital between October 1 , 1923 , and May 31 , 1924 . Of these 129 were positive for E. histolytica on stool examination . Five groups were recognized by these investigators , according to the character of the symptoms as follows . These results show that foreigners exhibit both more severe and more mild symptoms than Chinese and are correspondingly low in the number of healthy carriers when compared with the Chinese . These data indicate that although the Chinese are more highly infected their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners and that , therefore , a real difference exists in susceptibility and resistance of the different races to E. histolytica . Age . The relation between age in man and host-susceptibility to E. histolytica is not well known . Young animals seem to be more frequently infected with parasites than adults . Kessel and Svensson ( 1924 ) , however , report conditions among the Chinese that do not coincide with this view . Of Too individuals between the ages of I and 15 years , 25.3 per cent were infected , between 16 and 50 , 29.2 per cent , and over 51 , 34.4 per cent were infected . Kessel ( 1923 ) in an earlier report noted that older rats are more resistant to infection with human amoebae than younger rats . It is well known that kittens are more readily infected with E. histolytica than are older cats . The character of the infection may also differ with age . Kittens usually come down with an acute infection whereas Wagener and Thomson ( 1924 ) obtained chronic infections in 3 adult and 3 half-grown cats with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter greater resistance in the older animals . This resistance affects the size and number of amoebae ; those from acute cases being large and numerous , whereas those from chronic cases are smaller and few in number . Experiments to determine the relative susceptibility of old and young cats were also carried out by Eguchi ( 1925 ) . Of 15 kittens that were fed cysts of E. histolytica , 6 or 40 per cent developed dysentery and one liver abscess ; but of 23 cats over 500 gin . in weight only 2 or 8.6 per cent became infected . Eguchi believes this result // is due to a deficiency of protective bodies in the mucous membrane of the young hosts and the development of immunity in the older animals . Wagener ( 1924 ) secured evidence that the severity of the infection depends on both the age of the host and the amount of material injected . Thus young kittens exhibited symptoms in from 2 to 5 days and frequently died on the fourth day ; whereas adult cats did not become dysenteric for a week or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two adult cats remained alive and passed amoebae for six weeks and a half-grown cat recovered and its stools became amceba-free . The infection in kittens although more severe was limited to the rectum ; in adult cats the entire area from the ileo-cecal valve to the anus was eroded . It seems certain that resistance to infection and to the pathological effects of tissue invasion is acquired as the host grows older , but the nature of this resistance is unknown . Does infection with amcebw of the same or a different species add to the resistance of the host ? Kessel ( 1923 ) answers this in the affirmative . He found that young rats that were infected with rat amoebae were more difficult to infect with human amoebae than those that were amceba-free , indicating that resistance to human amceb e is built up by a foreign host that is infected with its " normal " species . Climate . Climate ( see p. 81 ) is often called upon to explain host susceptibility to histolytica infection . The fact to be explained is the greater number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperate re-IO2 E. HISTOLYTICA : IMMUNOLOGICAL REACTIONS gions although the incidence of infection is apparently not much greater in the former . The consensus of opinion seems to be that the resistance of the host is so greatly lowered in the tropics that the ama b2e are able to invade the tissues sufficiently to bring about symptoms . Other possible explanations are increases in the aggressivity of the parasites due to rapid passage through the hosts ( see p. 105 ) , the presence of more aggressive strains in the tropics , mass infections due to favorable weather and insanitary conditions , and the character of the diet . 8 . IMMUNOLOGICAL REACTIONS Complement fixation . Very little attention has been directed toward the study of immunity reactions in amoebic infections and the data on this subject are therefore few and indefinite . Izar ( 1914a ) claims to have obtained positive complement fixation , using aqueous antigens from liver abscess pus and from the feces of infected cats . Successful results were secured with the serum from three cats and five persons infected with E. histolytica . Hage ( 1920 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used antigens from liver abscess pus and from the feces of infected human beings . He accounts for his failure on the ground that any antigen present is too small in amount to be extracted easily . Now that methods of cultivating E. histolytica have been devised , a new source of antigens is available . Precipitin tests . Wagener ( 1924 ) prepared antigen from scrapings of ulcerated areas in infected cats and obtained a positive precipitin test in cats infected for // a week or longer after amoba appeared in their stools , but a negative result when serum from normal cats or from cats infected less than a week were used . Intradermal reactions . Scalas ( 1923 ) obtained remarkably successful results in his experiments with intradermal reactions . He used an antigen prepared from the fresh feces of a case of acute dysentery which he injected intracutaneously into patients suffering from acute , subacute and chronic stages of amoebic dysentery and into non-dysenteric subjects . The 9 infected patients gave a positive result , i. e. , a swelling which itched and was hot ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without itching or heat . 9 . CHANGES IN THE PARASITE DUE TO RESIDENCE IN THE HOST ( I ) AGGRESSIVITY . The problems involved . As already mentioned , many persons are " contact carriers " who never have shown symptoms but " carry " the amoba in their intestine and pass cysts in their feces . The discovery that E. histolytica can live , grow and reproduce in culture without access to tissue elements indicates that this organism can live in the lumen of the intestine and suggests that the intestinal wall of contact carriers may never be invaded by the amoba . This brings up the important problem of parasite aggressivity . Are strains that inhabit contact carriers lacking in aggressivity ? Are they capable of bringing about acute infections ? Can the aggressivity of a strain be increased by rapid passage through a number of hosts ? Are there adolescent and senile strains or periods in the life-cycle // of one strain ? Can a strain retain its aggressivity against the acquired resistance of the host or against drugs ? Human experiments . The experiments of Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amceb e in contact carriers are sufficiently aggressive to give rise to acute amcebiasis and that the condition of the host is the important factor , not the aggressivity of the parasite . They found that 2 of the 20 men employed in their experiments never became infected ; that several of the remaining 18 had to be fed cysts more than once before positive results were obtained ; and that cysts from a convalescent carrier produced a contact carrier when fed to a second man , and that cysts from him produced another contact carrier when fed to a third man , but when cysts from this individual were fed to a fourth man an acute case developed 20 days later . It is possible that rapid passage through several hosts increased the aggressivity of the strain to such an extent as to bring about an acute attack in the fourth man but this does not seem probable . Animal experiments . Several investigators , on the other hand , have found that when kittens are used as experimental animals the percentage of infections obtained and the severity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The evidence indicates that the amoebae differ virulence and that material from chronic cases is not as infective as that from acute cases . Thus Baetjer and Sellards ( 1914 ) state that " chronic cases of long standing , with mild symptoms , often produced an attack in animals which was of comparatively short duration and eventually ended in recovery . " Wagener and Thomson ( 1924 ) had no difficulty in producing // amcebiasis in kittens when they used amceb e from an acute case but only one of 14 kittens became infected when motile amcebe from a chronic human case were injected into the rectum ; this single case developed into a chronic infection which was difficult to transfer to other kittens and exhibited no lesions on autopsy . ( 2 ) RESISTANCE TO DRUGS . Many cases have been described in the literature of drug resistant strains of E. histolytica . An attempt was made by Dobell and Laidlaw ( 1926a ) to determine whether this species when grown in culture is able to build up a resistance to emetin . A strain that survived a medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a similar medium for over a month , and also in media containing larger amounts of emetin . The cultures were kept going in the I to 50,000 dilution only with difficulty ; no continued growth was obtained in media of greater emetin concentration ; and no evidence was obtained of an increase in resistance to the drug . These investigators believe that " emetin-resistant " cases of amcebiasis are not due to a resistant strain of amceb e but are the result of some physiological idiosyncrasy of the host that prevents the emetin from reaching the large intestine , possibly being excreted in the urine , as appears to be true when the drug is administered to cats . That differences may exist , however , as regards sensitiveness to emetin in strains both from man and monkey was noted by these investigators ; one human strain was more sensitive to the drug than the other , and this was true also of the two monkey strains used . Kofoid and Wagener ( 1925 ) also report studies with Io6 E. HISTOLYTICA : CARRIERS drugs on E. histolytica in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i to 250 for yatren casein , to I to ioo , 000 for arsphenamine . Of particular interest are the results obtained in experiments with emetin hydrochloride . Amoeba were unable to live for 24 hours in culture tubes containing dilutions of 1 to 500o or less and were successful only at dilutions of i to 16,600 or greater . At the end of 48 hours no amoebae were still living in dilutions of i to 16,600 or less and only a few in dilutions of from I to 20,000 to i to 100,000 . The size of the amoebae in cultures containing the lowest dilution in which they were able to exist was two or three times that of normal specimens , which suggests that the presence of emetin in such quantities prevents division . This suggestion , that emetin in certain dilutions inhibits reproduction , is also made by Dobell and Laidlaw but their results show that this inhibition , if it exists , is only temporary since amoebae transferred from such cultures to normal cultures grow and multiply and show no ill effects from their previous subjection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ) THE CARRIER CONDITION . Contact and convalescent carriers . Infections with E. histolytica seldom end fatally and in most cases never exhibit an acute phase . The reactions of host and parasite may result in various conditions such as acute amcebiasis , the carrier condition , latency and relapse . In the majority of cases the infected host never experiences what we are accustomed to consider symptoms of amcebiasis ; such a host is known // as a " contact " carrier . Spontaneous recovery or recovery following the administration of drugs does not necessarily include the elimination of the amceb e from the body but only the cessation of symptoms . As Walker ( Walker and Sellards , 1913 ) pointed out , the acute stage is followed by the " convalescent " carrier condition during which the amoba still multiply within the host and escape with the feces usually in the form of cysts . Such hosts may suffer relapses during which acute symptoms reappear . The period of infection . How long a host remains infected , unless cured by the administration of drugs , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection once established persists throughout the life of the host . Various investigators have attempted to determine the length of infections in particular hosts ( Low , 1916 ; Wenyon and O'Connor , 1917 ; Dobell and Stevenson , 1918 ) , and although they seem to prove that infections persist for many years , the chances of reinfection are so favorable that no definite conclusion can be reached . Host-parasite relations during the carrier period . There are three principal points of view with regard to host-parasite relations during the carrier period . The first is that the amoba live as harmless commensals in the lumen of the intestine . This was considered impossible until recent cultivation experiments proved that tissue elements are not necessary for the growth and reproduction of the trophozoites . The second view is that the amoebae require access to the tissue of the intestinal wall ; that they must have tissue elements for their growth and reproduction ; and Io8 E. HISTOLYTICA : CARRIERS that they therefore always injure the body of the host . These injuries , however , because of host resistance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tissue as rapidly as they are incurred , the result being a sort of equilibrium between host and parasite . The third view is that a large proportion of carriers suffer from " chronic " amcebiasis . Kofoid and his colleagues have been studying this phase of the subject for several years . They state that " It has been possible for the last two years to say that there is a definite disease entity that can be recognized by clinical means as chronic amcebiasis . According to our own records , this is so definite that fully 95 per cent of cases can be diagnosed clinically , before laboratory confirmation is obtained . " " Over a period of years , constant search has been made for a true carrier , but as yet only one individual has been found by the medical author in more than 50o cases who showed no visible tissue damage attributable to E. dysenterice . . . . In symptomatology , one of the salient facts is that persons with amebiasis commonly complain of fatigability . They go to bed tired , and arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work or rest ; many of them are so tired that they are in actual anguish ; others merely say they have lost their pep . ' Very commonly associated with fatigability is constipation , or constipation interspersed with evanescent diarrheas . Occasionally one will elicit the passing of considerable quantities of mucus or blood . A normal man knows hunger and the desire for evacuation ; otherwise his bowel does not obtrude on his consciousness . In amebiasis the patient often has no actual pain . On the I09 HOST-PARASITE RELATIONS : INTESTINAL PROTOZOA other hand , he is not comfortable in the abdominal region . He is , as we say , bowel conscious . ' He may have considerable flatulence . He may or may not complain of definite soreness in the right lower quadrant , in the right upper quadrant , or in the region of the splenic flexure . He may complain of neuritic symptoms , pain along the course of some particular nerve or nerves . He may complain of basal headache , or of pain and aching in the region of joints . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abdomen , that leads to the clinical suspicion of hyperacidity , hypoacidity , gastric and duodenal ulcers , chronic pancreatitis , chronic cholecystitis , chronic duodenitis or chronic hepatitis . He may complain of cough and expectoration , with bloody sputum . He may complain of rapid pulse , and one may see mild tachycardias . He may complain of much nervousness , and one may find in him symptoms of a subacute or chronic thyroiditis . He may complain of defective vision , and one may find greatly impaired vision with or without definite iritis . Some may complain of disabling loss of memory , while others show various neuroses . One may find also the grosser lesions of liver abscess , lung abscess , brain abscess , skin ulcers , etc . The matter can be summed up by saying that in chronic amebiasis we are dealing with a disease entity as protean as syphilis . " Boyers , Kofoid &; Swezy ( 1925 ) . Acton and Knowles ( 1924 ) are also among those who believe the " healthy " carrier is not always free from clinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. histolytica carriers ; the first the thin , lean , cadaverous individual whose food assimilation is inade-IIO E. HISTOLYTICA : LATENCY AND RELAPSE quate , who tends to be faddy and irritable , who is vaguely ill , without knowing what is wrong with him ; the second the fat jovial type , with good food assimilation , a bon viveur , who soon discovers , however , that indulgence in short drinks ' at the club bar is apt to be followed by trouble . Together with minor ulceration of the colon mucosa by the entamceb e goes a train of ill-defined symptoms , " which they describe in detail under the subheads , irregularity in the state of the bowels , pain , fever , bacterial embolism , and absorption of poisonous pressor bases from the ulcerated gut . Craig ( 1927 ) states that his experience indicates that more than 50 per cent of the so-called carriers of E. histolytica present some symptoms apparently caused by the presence of these amoebae in the intestine . These symptoms are largely confined to the digestive and nervous systems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of appetite is very frequent and is associated with loss of weight ; and evanescent neuralgic pains in the lower portion of the abdomen and other symptoms are characteristic . The symptoms referable to the nervous system are of the neurasthenic type . A mild degree of anemia and occasional subnormal temperature may occur . Craig expresses belief in the routine examinations of stools and in efforts to cure carriers . ( 2 ) LATENCY AND RELAPSE . Latency in amcebiasis exists only in the sense that parasites may be present without the appearance of symptoms . If fecal specimens from hosts in which E. histolytica is living in a " latent " condition are examined daily , eventually cysts or trophozoites will be found . As noted above ( p . Io8 ) a host III HOST-PARASITE RELATIONS : INTESTINAL PROTOZOA when once infected may remain infected throughout the rest of his life . He may never show symptoms , but is always liable to come down with an acute infection . If an acute infection appears he may recover with or without treatment . Such a recovery , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many other protozoan diseases . Just what modifications in the host or parasite are responsible for relapses are not known with certainty . II . HOST-PARASITE SPECIFICITY No comprehensive study has yet been made of the host-parasite specificity of E. histolytica . Spontaneous infections with this species have been reported in certain species of lower animals and experimental infections have been obtained in primates , carnivores and rodents . Primates . Both spontaneous amoebic dysentery and amoebic liver abscess have been reported in monkeys , and Suldey ( 1924 ) has recently noted acute dysentery in a 3-year-old chimpanzee . Many investigators have described amoebae from primates other than man among which are types resembling E. histolytica and E. coli so closely that they can not be separated by means of morphological or cultural characteristics . This fact throws doubt on all data obtained as a result of attempts to infect these animals with E. histolytica . Of particular interest is the recent observation of Dobell ( 1926b ) that histolytica-like amoebae from the monkey when cultivated in artificial media and injected into cats produces dysentery that differs from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physiological I12 E. HISTOLYTICA : CARNIVORES AND RODENTS difference between the types found in man and monkey . ( Discussions of the amoebae of monkeys may be found in the books of Dobell ( 1919a ) and Wenyon ( 1926 ) , and in the recent papers by Brug ( 1923 ) , Mello ( 1923 ) , Suldey ( 1924 ) , Kessel ( 1924 ) , Dobell ( 1926b ) and Dobell and Laidlaw ( 1926b ) . Carnivores . Spontaneous amoebic dysentery has also been reported in cats and dogs , and kittens have proved to be more easily infected with E. histolytica than any other lower animal ( see pp. lot , 105 ) . Infections may be brought about by feeding cysts to the experimental animal or injecting trophozoites per anum . When an infection is obtained in cats it is usually acute and recovery is rare . Kruse and Pasquale ( 1894 ) claim to have infected a cat with amoebae from a liver abscess . Liver abscesses have been reported in both cats and dogs . Rodents . Rats and Mice . Recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been carried on by Brug ( 1919a ) , Kessel ( 1923 ) , Wagener and Thomson ( 1924 ) and Chiang ( 1925a , 1925b ) . Brug found two wild rats in Java which were infected with amceb e that apparently belonged to the species E. histolytica , and reported the experimental infection of a specimen of Mus rattus with E. histolytica from man . Kessel had no difficulty in infecting young rats and mice by feeding them human feces containing cysts of E. histolytica and of other human amoebae . Transfer of these human amoebae from one rat to another was also successfully accomplished . No morphological or racial differences could be found between the amoebe before and after they had been established in the rat hosts . The infections in // both rats and mice were chronic instead of acute as in kittens . The experiments of Wagener and Thomson were performed with motile amoeba : injected into the rectum of amceba-free rats . Negative results were obtained with 16 rats when thus treated and with 4 rats into the cecum of which motile amcebw were injected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only succeeded in infecting rats but in obtaining dysenteric symptoms in cats fed on cysts passed by the rats . He also found that clean rats became parasitized when placed in the same cage with infected rats . Several species of amoebae have been described as normal inhabitants of the rat 's intestine ; hence there is always danger of confusion between these and introduced species . Rat experiments must therefore be carried on with extreme care and great familiarity with both the normal and foreign ameebw is necessary to insure reliable data . The evidence indicates that rats and mice may become infected with E. histolytica , but that they are often parasitized by this species in nature , or play anything but a very minor role in transmission is doubtful . Guinea-pigs . Of the many investigators who have attempted to infect guinea-pigs with E. histolytica only Baetjer and Sellards ( 1914 ) and Chatton ( 1917a , 1918 ) have reported positive results . Chatton first obtained infections by feeding cysts to guinea-pigs and then infected other pigs by the rectal injection of trophozoites from these . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , one in 20 days and another in 9 days . The site of infection was the cecum where a hyperplasia of the epithelium of the glands of // Lieberkiihn developed . The differences between the reactions of two species of hosts ( man and guinea-pig ) to the same parasite are strikingly brought out by these experiments . Wagener and Thomson ( 1924 ) attempted to repeat these experiments without success . Since the colon of the guinea-pig is 30 inches long they doubt if Chatton obtained cecal infection by rectal injections . Rabbits . Huber ( 1909 ) , until recently , was the only investigator who claimed to have infected rabbits with E. histolytica . Four of the 8 rabbits were positive . The amoebae produced ulcers in the cecum but did not bring on diarrhea or dysentery and were not passed in the feces . Thomson ( 1926 ) has likewise succeeded in infecting rabbits . Rectal injections of motile amoebae from cats failed but one of 3 rabbits fed cysts of E. histolytica from a chronic human case became infected and died 30 days after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feces. nor found at autopsy . The cecum alone was parasitized , and that invasion of the tissues occurred was proved by the discovery of amoeba in the mucosa , submucosa and circular muscular layer . No doubt many other species of animals could be infected with E. histolytica in the laboratory but probably very few of these ever become parasitized in nature except under extraordinary conditions . However , by carefully performed experiments it may be possible to determine why cysts hatch in one species of host and not in another ; why newly hatched trophozoites are able to live and multiply in one species of host and not in another ; why one host becomes infected and another of // the same species does not ; and the many other problems that are involved in the study of host-parasite specificity ( see p. 42 ) . I2 . PREVENTION AND CONTROL Carriers and transmitting agents . The methods of transmission of histolytica cysts have already been described ( Pp. 74-83 ) . Amcebiasis is a preventable disease just as are typhoid fever , bacillary dysentery , cholera , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous , since only trophozoites appear in their stools and these are probably seldom if ever responsible for new infections ( p. 65 ) ; it is the carrier who is passing cysts that must be guarded against . Such a carrier may discharge as many as 300,000,000 cysts in a single day ( Kof oid , 1923 ) . These cysts , as already pointed out ( p. 67 ) , can not be conveyed through the air since they are killed by dessication ; they must enter a new host by way of the mouth in a moist condition . The problems of prevention and control , therefore , concern methods of transmission and the destruction or control of transmitting agents . The protection of individuals . Individuals are probably usually infected by cysts ingested in food or drink . These cysts may reach drinking water because of soil pollution or.contamination in some other way ; they may be transferred to food by infected . food-handlers who are passing cysts , by flies or other animals that have fed upon infected human feces , or by the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of contaminated water to wash uncooked vegetables . Trans-I16 E. HISTOLYTICA : PREVENTION AND CONTROL mission by association has already been mentioned ( p. 79 ) ; this apparently often occurs in families , a member who is a carrier by uncleanly habits contaminating the food , drinking water , towels , wash bowl , etc . The danger from uncooked vegetables is especially great in countries such as China where night soil is used as fertilizer . Recently Mills , Bartlett and Kessel ( 1925 ) have concluded from their experiments that " Dipping fruits and vegetables for Io seconds in boiling water , or water which remains above 80 ? C. during the immersion , is the only method thus far discovered , which will uniformly kill all pathogenic bacteria , protozoan cysts , and helminth eggs which might be found contaminating such food products , and render them safe for human consumption in an uncooked condition . " Protection might also be secured by a favorable diet . For example Kesse and kye-Kang ( 1926 ) find that an exclusive diet of raw milk always brings about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intestine of the host and in certain cases entire freedom from the amoebae resulted . The protection of communities . Community efforts for the prevention and control of amoebic infection should be directed primarily toward improvements in water supplies , and general sanitation . An excellent example of community protection by the provision of a pure water supply is afforded by statistics from Panama given by Clark ( 1924 ) . Adequate water systems were installed in Panama in 1914-1915 . During the period from 1905-1914 , 170 cases of amoebiasis ( 4.25 per cent ) were noted among 4,00o autopsies , whereas from 1914 to 1923 only 16 cases ( 0.57 per cent ) were recorded among 2,800 I17 HOST-PARASITE RELATIONS : INTESTINAL PROTOZOA autopsies . Educational campaigns and the automobile have already lessened the danger from dissemination by flies . The use of cresol to kill cysts in f ecal material bef ore they could be ingested by flies and other animals might be effective . Any efforts to bring about a decrease in soil pollution would also be helpful . The control and treatment of carriers are difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1922 ) , for example , has attempted to determine the feasibility of diagnosing United States veterans of the World War and of treating those who are found to be infected . He estimated that the microscopic work alone would cost $5 , - 000,000 and that the hospitalization , treatment , etc. , would add $25,000,000 more . The sterilization of foodhandlers in markets , hotels and restaurants has also been advocated but the difficulties and expense involved make this proposal likewise impracticable . IV . Host-Parasite Relations between Man and Other Species of Ainwbce The species of ameeboe , other than E. histolytica , that live in man are considered by practically every protozoologist to be harmless commensals . For this reason they have not been the subject of such intensive study as their near relative , E. histolytica . There is consequently nothing or very little to be said regarding them with respect to such subjects as pathogenesis , symptomatology , immunology , resistance to infection , susceptibility of the host , aggressivity of the parasite , relapse , etc . Furthermore , many of the subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding transmission , infection , prevention , etc. , are omitted here in order to avoid repetition . Instead , therefore , of following the outline used in discussing E. histolytica , only those phases of the hostparasite relations will be referred to in the case of the other amoebae of man that call for special attention . 1 . ENDAMCOA COLI Epidemiology of transmission . As in the case of E. histolytica , E. coli is no doubt usually transmitted in the cyst stage , although occasionally trophozoites may bring about the colonization of a new host ( see p. 65 ) . Experiments designed particularly to test the viability of histolytica cysts outside of the body under various conditions have contributed also to our knowledge of this subject with respect to cysts of E. coli . Certain of the results of these experiments are included in the account of E. histolytica ( see p. 71 ) ; these indicate that the same principles obtain in both species and hence a detailed statement regarding the cysts of E. coli seems unnecessary . No doubt the cysts of E. coli reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are carried about by flies and possibly by lower animals such as mice , rats , cats and dogs . The very high incidence of infection with E. coli among the general population , which appears to be at least 5o per cent , indicates that fecal contamination of our food and drink is very prevalent . All persons in whom E. coli lives are carriers who are more or less constantly passing cysts capable of bringing about the colonization of new hosts . 119
