Place : A sort of outdoor living room in the country house of MRS . BOUCICAULT  --  some place in Westchester . The room has an air of great comfort and luxury and smartness  --  achieved with severe simplicity . At Curtain : The room is empty  --  then PERKINS comes in from the hall at Left . PERKINS is a neat and substantial maid of about thirty , wearing a gray uniform and small apron . Her disposition is somewhat ruffled at the moment , as she brings in a palm leaf fan  --  a book  --  a light wool rug  --  a black silk handbag and a small pillow  --  all of which she puts in and about the large chair at Right Center . WHITMAN , MRS . BOUCICAULT 'S major-domo of long standing , comes onto the terrace from the Left and into the room with an observant eye as PERKINS is placing the things . WHITMAN is gray and venerable , English and imposing  --  and only enduringly tolerant of other people and their shortcomings . WHITMAN ( with great dignity and deliberation ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at the proper time . PERKINS I had all this stuff in the garden once , when she changed her mind and told me to put it here . p. 9 WHITMAN Certainly , I told her it would be cooler here . PERKINS It would be just as well if you minded your own business . It 's bad enough to keep up with her notions  --  hopping all over the place  --  without you changing her mind for her . WHITMAN I have been changing her mind for her for forty years  --  and I expect to keep on doing so , without any suggestions from you , Miss . ( WILLIAMS , a well set up chauffeur , with a slight Irish brogue comes onto the terrace from the Right and into the room . ) WILLILAMS Hadley just telephoned from the station that nobody got off that train . WHITMAN ( turning slowly towards WILLIAMS ) He was instructed to meet the five-fifteen and wait for a train that somebody did get off of . PERKINS God knows who will get off  --  or how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the King of the Fiji Islands . WHITMAN Again I suggest that is none of your business , Perkins . PERKINS I suppose it 's yours . I suppose you suggested the guest to her also . p. 10 WHITMAN I have been known to do so . ( Turning again to WILLIAMS who is slightly amused but brings himself to perfect order as WHITMAN 'S stern eye fixes him . ) Williams , telephone Hadley , at the station , to wait until someone peculiar and distinctive arrives . ( WILLIAMS starts to go  --  but turns back as WHITMAN goes on . ) Someone likely to be coming here . PERKINS Something queer enough likely to be coming here . WILLILAMS Male or female ? MRS . BOUCICAULT ( coming out from the hall at Left ) Whitman  --  her name is Brown  --  Mrs. Courtland Brown  --  and I want her put at the end of the north wing . ( At the sound of MRS .

WHITMAN stands still more perfectly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the small table by the chair  --  managing to drop one of them much to WHITMAN 'S annoyance . MRS . BOUCICAULT is seventy-six  --  half Victorian  --  half ultra-modern  --  an enormous amount of dominating personality radiating from her hardness and her insatiable thirst for life . Her clothes have rather a grand manner of having been well made but not modish  --  and a good deal of jewelry is mixed up with chains and three kinds of glasses hung about her neck . Her hair  --  iron gray  --  is worn rather high in puffs  --  her voice is warm and deep and her sense of humor dry and sharp . She has one slightly stiff knee and walks with a stout stick with a curved handle . She is followed on by STRUTHERS  --  a good looking footman in a dark conservative uniform . She moves now in state towards her chair at Right where she sits a little heavily . STRUTHERS places the foot piece and lifts the foot of the stiff leg carefully , putting it on the stool. ) p. 11 WHITMAN ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suite on the south side ready , madam . MRS . BOUCICAULT The north wing I said . WHITMAN ( with tolerance  --  knowing he is right ) Very good madam . The south side would be better . MRS . BOUCICAULT North . Poke that pillow in the right spot , Perkins . ( Indicating the middle of her back . ) Why would it be better ? How could it be better ? WHITMAN That suite has n't been open at all this summer , madam . MRS . BOUCICAULT Open it then . Open it . Why is n't it open ? WHITMAN You gave orders to close it , madam . ( STRUTHERS goes onto the terrace and off Right . ) MRS . BOUCICAULT ( knowing she is wrong ) Rubbish ! I did n't . Open it  --  open it . WHITMAN ( with resignation ) Very good , Madam . MRS .

Watch for the motor and bring Mrs. Brown here as soon as she comes  --  and get somebody at those rooms . Is n't that a motor now ? Go on  --  go on . Be quick . p. 12 WHITMAN ( as he goes off at Left with great deliberation ) I do n't think so , Madam . My ears are very sharp . MRS . BOUCICAULT How am I , Perkins ? If I did n't have to go through this confounded performance of dressing , life would be a much pleasanter business . Did you ever hear of the man who cut his throat because he got tired of the eternal shaving ? PERKINS You look very nice indeed , Mrs. Boucicault . Very nice indeed . MRS . BOUCICAULT What else could you say  --  poor thing ? Here , undo this . Oh , what a pest ! Do n't get old , Perkins . The longer you live the more you have to regret .

DIERDRE is a tall , dark , exotic creature of twenty  --  just now very startlingly beautiful in a one piece bathing suit of orange and black and a black coat. ) p. 13 LESSING Oh darling  --  I did n't know anybody was out here . I 'm going to jump in the pool before tea . MRS . BOUCICAULT I thought you were playing golf . LESSING I did eighteen holes this morning . Bit fed up . Awfully hot . MRS .

MRS . BOUCICAULT I thought you were playing golf . BOB I did eighteen holes this morning . Rather hot . MRS . BOUCICAULT Sounds like a well trained chorus . Have you been trying to keep cool in the house ? p. 14 BOB Trying to keep cool  --  yes . MRS . BOUCICAULT Did you succeed ? BOB Um  --  so-so . MRS . BOUCICAULT Bored ? BOB Not more than usual . In fact not quite so much so . Thanks to you for taking me in . MRS . BOUCICAULT You 'd better hurry unless you want to run into very pretty woman . BOB Another one ? LESSING ( coming back in time to hear this ) Come on , Bob . BOB You are a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell what grand mother 's going to pick up in her travels . MRS . BOUCICAULT Wait till you see her . I know something choice in women when I see it , as well as you do . BOB ( going to DIERDRE ) I 'm sure of that  --  but you 've let me see your grand daughter first . Anything after that is bound to be disappointing . LESSING ( smiling at BOB ) Keep it up . p. 15 BOB She 's more dark and glowing and mysterious than ever this afternoon . MRS . BOUCICAULT ( exasperated and helpless at their bold flirtation ) Go jump in the pool . BOB But she 's still more so in the water . I think I hear a motor now . Perhaps that 's your pretty lady . Let 's bolt . ( BOB and DIERDRE go out on terrace and off Left . ) WHITMAN ( coming on from Right of terrace . ) Mrs. Brown is here , Madam . MRS .

WHITMAN Very good , madam . ( Crossing to hall entrance where he waits . STRUTHERS enters from Right on terrace and stands Left Center . He is carrying KITTY 'S jewel case. ) p. 16 KITTY ( coming on from the Right and stopping at Center ) Oh , my dear ! It 's too wonderful to be here ! And I 've had the sweetest welcome . Your chauffeur looked at me very doubtfully till I asked if he was waiting for me  --  and then he said , " Oh , oh , I beg pardon , madam  --  I was looking for something much more peculiar . " ( STRUTHERS looks at WHITMAN , who in turn raises his eyebrows and goes out followed by STRUTHERS  --  through the hall . ) Will I do ?

KITTY And what is that ? I 'm a little suspicious now . MRS . BOUCICAULT Have you got a maid ? p. 17 KITTY A what ? Oh , my word , no . No such swank . I s'pose I should have rented one in New York . What shall I do ? Does it embarrass you ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Stuff ! Perkins will look after you . KITTY Thanks so much . I 'm clever and awfully neat . I sha n't need much , Perkins . Take the hat out right away , please , and put it on a jigger  --  and here are my keys . PERKINS ( catching the keys as KITTY tosses them ) Thank you , Madam .

The shops are full of the most ravishing August things for nothing at all  --  absolutely nothing at all  --  if one has anything at all  --  which I have n't . ( Pulling off her gloves she goes out onto the terrace  --  looking off . ) Oh , how sweet ! How sweet ! It 's as peaceful as England . MRS . BOUCICAULT And just as dull . Are you looking for peace ? KITTY ( coming back into the room ) I 'm not looking for anything . I know better . p. 18 MRS . BOUCICAULT Blessed are they who expect nothing for they shall not be disappointed . KITTY ( going to sit on the sofa at Left ) Well  --  I made it . This is a hurry call , Bouci . What 's it all about ? I was on my way to California . Mother has n't seen the children in three years . I wiped everything off the slate  --  threw some things into a trunk and dashed without thinking  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forgot my lip rouge . MRS . BOUCICAULT What have you been doing since I picked you up in Paris ? April  --  May  --  June  --  July  --  August  --  ( Counting them off on her fingers . ) KITTY Different men  --  for different months . April was the most exasperatingly interesting man I have ever known  --  May was  --  mm  --  so-so  --  and June  --  Well , we 'll skip June  --  You are n't listening anyway , you 're dying to talk yourself . MRS . BOUCICAULT I 'm not sorry I asked you . You look just as well as I thought you would . At least I suppose you do . Come here and untangle this pesky thing . By the time I 've got them loose and on my nose I 've forgotten what it was I wanted to look at . p. 19 KITTY ( having gone across to MRS . BOUCICAULT and extricated the glasses ) You were going to look at me  --  I believe  --  but do n't  --  if they 're too penetrating . What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with it . ) MRS . BOUCICAULT I want you to do something for me . KITTY ( opening the parasol and twirling it ) Yes ? MRS . BOUCICAULT There 's a man here  --  KITTY ( turning quickly to MRS . BOUCICAULT ) Ah !  --  MRS . BOUCICAULT Where are the children ? KITTY In town with the nurse till Monday . MRS . BOUCICAULT I was afraid to tell you not to bring them for fear I 'd seem rude  --  but thank God you did n't . KITTY Do n't you suppose I know when to display my jewels  --  and when not to ? ( Sitting at Center . ) MRS . BOUCICAULT He 's bored . KITTY Who ? p. 20 MRS . BOUCICAULT The man . KITTY Oh ! I 'll do my best  --  till Monday . MRS . BOUCICAULT How Good is your best ? KITTY Depends on the man . One must be inspired  --  as well as inspiring . MRS . BOUCICAULT A girl is after him  --  hot footed . KITTY Is he running ? MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's coming on . That 's what worries me . KITTY Good . Much more stimulating for me . What 's he like ? What shall I be like  --  to get him ? MRS . BOUCICAULT He 's one of those stray dogs I get interested in . I do n't know much about him  --  except that he 's been divorced  --  at least once , and seems to be rather humble as men go  --  and to have a fair amount of money . With your alimony it would n't be bad at all . KITTY ( very much amused ) This is very touching  --  your interest in me . What do you want really ? What 's biting you ? MRS . BOUCICAULT The girl . p. 21 KITTY Oh . MRS . BOUCICAULT She 's one of those gorgeous young things that are running around loose now . Lives alone  --  is alone  --  father one place  --  mother another  --  knows everything  --  everybody  --  done everything  --  and only twenty years old . KITTY I know . I know . Wonderful  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now . I 've been made . They just are . MRS . BOUCICAULT When are you going to marry again ? KITTY Never . MRS . BOUCICAULT What are you going to do then  --  if you do n't marry  --  live in what we used to call  --  sin ? KITTY ( laughing ) My one little talent  --  clothes  --  is beginning to make money  --  and when I 'm paying my own bills  --  men may come and men may go . MRS . BOUCICAULT Are you implying that up to this point there have n't been any  --  either coming  --  or going ? KITTY ( rising and moving away ) Now , Boucicault , that 's clumsy . I 'm surprised at you . p. 22 MRS . BOUCICAULT That 's my way of being subtle . Come here , Kitty . ( Drawing a small chair out in front of her . ) Will you do this for me  --  take him away from the girl ? KITTY ( going to MRS . BOUCICAULT ) I thought your religion was hands off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work when it comes home . She 's my own grandchild . KITTY ( sitting in the chair before MRS . BOUCICAULT ) Oh , I see . MRS . BOUCICAULT I 've got to keep her from going to the dogs before the first of October . KITTY Why the first of October ? MRS . BOUCICAULT She 's going to marry a nice boy the first of October  --  an awfully nice boy . He 's here too . They 've got everything in the world in common to make a go of it  --  when  --  bing  --  out of the blue she takes this shameless damnable passion for this man . KITTY You do n't think you can do anything about that  --  do you ? MRS . BOUCICAULT That 's why I sent for you . p. 23 KITTY You never seemed like an old woman to me before , Bouci  --  not a bit . Always as fresh and open minded about life as  --  MRS . BOUCICAULT Shut up . I 'm not talking about life , I 'm talking about my own granddaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be expected to use your common sense at all . MRS . BOUCICAULT She 's in a kind of danger I do n't want to recognize  --  but I 'm frightened , Kitty . I want to beat her over the head and make her behave , but I 'm pretending I do n't see anything . Now the best thing that could possibly happen is for you to take the man . KITTY I 'm tremendously flattered that you think I could get a man away from a stunning young thing like that  --  but even if I could , do n't you know the sooner she finds out everything for herself  --  the sooner she loses her romantic illusions  --  the happier and safer she 's going to be ? MRS . BOUCICAULT I 'm not so sure . Women are getting everything they think they want now , but are they any happier than when they used to stay at home  --  with their romantic illusions  --  and let men fool them ? KITTY At least they 're more intelligent . That 's one thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . BOUCICAULT Un ! I 'd like to live another fifty years  --  without the bother of living  --  to see this thing through . I 've watched a long procession of men , women and morals through three generations . I 'm seventy-six , and I do n't know anything . KITTY That 's why you 're so wise , dearest . MRS . BOUCICAULT I always knew my husband was n't faithful to me , but I lived in hell with him for fifty years because divorce was n't respectable . My only daughter had three divorces  --  which I was tickled to death to see her get  --  and here 's my grandchild in the middle of this modern moral revolution and I 'm helpless  --  ca n't do a thing for her . She 's grown up before I knew it  --  dumped herself in my lap and this thing has happened right under my nose . KITTY Then for Heaven 's sake , let it happen . Let it alone . MRS . BOUCICAULT No  --  by God  --  I wo n't . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I have to lock her up till  --  KITTY Now see here , Bouci . I do n't think I 'm clever enough for this job if it 's as important as all that . MRS . BOUCICAULT You can do it if you want to . Did n't I see you take the Russian away from the Italian princess before she even knew it ? p. 25 KITTY I did n't take him away . I just borrowed him for the week-end . Who else is here besides your piece de resistance ? MRS . BOUCICAULT I ca n't remember . I never see anyone till tea . From then on to midnight is as much as I can stand of any guest . KITTY You do n't care what they do after midnight  --  just so they let you alone . MRS . BOUCICAULT Not a bit . They 'll be coming in in sections now . Oh  --  here 's Townley . ( As TOWNLEY TOWN strolls in dragging his golf bag . TOWNLEY is forty  --  tall , plain and charming  --  not very vivid  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His golf clothes are well worn and his bag is shabby . ) Townley , this is Mrs. Courtland Brown . She 's not quite as sweet as she looks , but you 'll think she is . Go and impress her . TOWN ( going down to KITTY ) I 'm nicer than I look  --  much . KITTY ( giving her left hand to him ) How could you be ! How do you do . Oh you magnificent long legged Britishers ! I 've been avoiding you in Paris  --  but you are wonderful  --  are n't you ? p. 26 TOWN Yes  --  we are  --  are n't we ? KITTY ( to MRS . BOUCICAULT as TOWNLEY goes to Left to put down his golf bag ) I thought you said he was humble . MRS . BOUCICAULT This is n't the one . KITTY Oh  --  I 'm sorry ! I 'll have to say it all over again  --  for that 's the way I 'm going to begin . TOWN Begin what ? ( Turning back to KITTY . ) KITTY ( moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to get a man .

TOWN She does n't seem to need practice . KITTY Let 's begin at the beginning . Who are you ? TOWN ( putting his hands on the back of the sofa and leaning towards KITTY ) Well  --  I 'm a professional visitor . I get an S.O.S. from Bouci  --  " Man shy "  --  and I come . I have a suit case  --  sport clothes  --  dinner clothes and a suit to arrive in . I take on any woman in any way desired  --  and I use my knife and fork in the continental manner . p. 27 KITTY And way down deep in under you 're a very sweet person . TOWN You 've found me out .

BOUCICAULT Here 's another one . ( As BRUCE KEEN comes in  --  also in golf clothes and a bag  --  without a hat . He is young tall and good looking in a fresh straightforward way . ) Are you wet too ? KEEN Not a bit . I changed at the Club . Why ? Do I look messy ? TOWN ( to KITTY ) So did I change . I only said that to show you I was even willing to catch cold for you . I 'm just as dry and sweet scented as he is . So do n't push me off on that account . KITTY I 'm hanging on to you . Who 's that ? ( Smiling at BRUCE , who has disposed of his golf bag and gone to stand beside MRS . BOUCICAULT . ) TOWN Nobody you 'll care about . p. 28 KEEN ( to KITTY ) Yes I am . KITTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure you are . I can tell that at long distance . KEEN ( to MRS . BOUCICAULT ) Where 's Dierdre ? MRS . BOUCICAULT ( evading his question ) That 's Mrs. Courtland Brown .

This is Bruce Keen  --  young  --  handsome and very much in demand both with the upper bums and the best people . But by Monday morning you 'll find me very much more satisfactory . KEEN Do you think that 's clever ? KITTY ( giving BRUCE her hand ) I did n't hear him . I was looking at you . How magnificent you long legged Americans are ! I 've been avoiding you in Paris  --  but you  --  ( TOWNLEY and MRS . BOUCICAULT laugh . ) KEEN What 's so funny about that ? p. 29 TOWN It 's deep . You have to be on the inside to get it .

BOUCICAULT Katherine , if you want to wash your hands and feet before you have it , somebody will take you in . KITTY I would n't leave for anything . Do you want me to pour it ? MRS . BOUCICAULT I certainly do not . Go and get your own , and if you do n't get what you want , it 's your own fault . Give me mine first , Whitman . That 's all I care about and who is rattling back there ? ( As STRUTHERS , the footman , rattles a cup and saucer . ) WHITMAN ( frowning and shaking his head at STRUTHERS ) Beg pardon , Madam . ( WHITMAN takes tea and cakes to MRS .

It 's like a glorified automat . KITTY I have n't had any luncheon but a Grand Central sandwich  --  which is still right here . ( Putting a finger on her chest . ) TOWN What will you have ? Hearts or crescents ? KITTY Both . Do n't ask me to eliminate anything . What are those over there , the dressy little green ones ? KEEN Try one and find out . ( Coming down to MRS . BOUCICAULT with his own highball and sandwich . ) Have you got everything ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Of course . Let me alone now . KEEN Is Brown with Dierdre ? p. 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know ? KEEN He is then . MRS . BOUCICAULT ( nodding towards KITTY ) She 'll get him away from her . Do n't you think she could ? KEEN ( looking at KITTY as she and TOWNLEY talk on the terrace ) Who is she really ? MRS . BOUCICAULT I do n't know . I picked her up in Paris because I like her . What do you think ? KEEN She 's got a very come hither look in her eye . MRS . BOUCICAULT Think so ? KEEN You know she has , you wise old devil . MRS . BOUCICAULT I do n't know anything about anybody . Go way . ( MADGE LIVINGSTON comes out from the hall . ) Oh  --  come out , Madge . How delightful you are ! It cools me off just to look at you . KEEN Marvelous  --  Mrs. Livingston . ( MRS . LIVINGSTON is possibly thirty-eight  --  looking younger  --  tall and frail and beautiful in a pale patrician way . She is now wearing something diaphanous and trailing , which adds to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hauteur. ) p. 32 MRS . BOUCICAULT I must say it pleases me to see a guest looking as if she 'd spent the whole day dressing for me to look at her  --  instead of running around day and night in a one piece something . KEEN What are you having ? LIVINGSTON I 'm not having anything . No , nothing , thank you , dear . ( As BRUCE comes towards her . ) Oh  --  will you be sweet enough to move this for me  --  just a little nearer ? ( Indicating the sofa . ) KEEN All right ? ( Having gone back of the sofa and moving it about one inch nearer to MADGE . ) LIVINGSTON Just , thanks . ( As she sits languidly . ) Oh there is a little breeze out here . I thought it was too hot to come out . Wallace has been reading aloud to me . ( BRUCE goes to KITTY and TOWNLEY on the terrace . ) MRS . BOUCICAULT I do n't know any greater proof  --  ( putting her tea down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitman . Take it away . I ca n't stand anything after I 'm through with it . ( WHITMAN comes from the terrace and takes the tea away . ) I do n't know any greater proof of a man 's slavish devotion to a woman than reading aloud to her in August . I s'pose you 've made him think his voice is beautiful . p. 33 LIVINGSTON Not so beautiful as his mind . Have you read his latest book ? MRS . BOUCICAULT I read everything . LIVINGSTON Is n't it the exquisite revelation of an exquisite spirit ? MRS . BOUCICAULT It seems to me to be the tired effort of a very tired man . A burned out one . LIVINGSTON You refuse to see him as he is . MRS . BOUCICAULT You refuse to see him as he is because you 've helped to burn him out . LIVINGSTON How detestable you can be , Boucicault . I thought you understood my tragedy . MRS . BOUCICAULT I do n't see much tragedy in a perfectly good husband with a bank-roll  --  on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beau  --  on the other . LIVINGSTON I 've sacrificed my life to Wallace and his work . I 've been his inspiration . He has written great books . MRS . BOUCICAULT Well  --  at least he 's been devoted to one woman for ten years . That 's a much more unusual thing for a man to do than to write a great book . Let 's give him credit for that . ( WALLACE GRAINGER appears in the hall entrance . He is about forty . A man with a great deal of manner  --  the perfection of which seems trying to make up for lost enthusiasms . He is wearing flannels and is in most perfect style . He carries a paper novel and paper knife. ) p. 34 MRS . BOUCICAULT Come out , Wallace . LIVINGSTON It is cooler out here , dear , after all . GRAINGER ( stopping in front of MADGE ) I finished it . It has a nice attitude at the end . LIVINGSTON Oh , really ? What ? GRAINGER I wo n't tell you . I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll only enjoy it with you . GRAINGER ( going to MRS . BOUCICAULT ) Try this , Mrs. Boucicault . You 'll find it very amusing and the most delightful French I 've read in a very long time . MRS . BOUCICAULT There are only two kinds of French for me  --  the kind I do understand and the kind I do n't . ( Taking the book . ) GRAINGER Are n't you having any tea , Madge ? LIVINGSTON No  --  but I will let you bring me a glass of water  --  no ice . Oh , there 's my handkerchief . Please . Thanks . ( As WALLACE picks up the handkerchief . ) And dearest  --  will you be an angel and bring me my scarf ? I left it on a chair by the door , just inside , I think . ( WALLACE goes back into the house . ) Is that somebody new out there ? Boucicault  --  ( As MRS . BOUCICAULT having opened the book , does n't hear her . ) Is that somebody new out there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ? ( Looking at KITTY , whose voice is heard as she chats gaily with the men on the terrace. ) p. 35 MRS . BOUCICAULT Kitty Brown . Mrs. Courtland Brown . LIVINGSTON Another Brown ? You seem to be going in for Browns . MRS . BOUCICAULT This is the California variety . Come here , Kitty . LIVINGSTON She does n't hear you . She seems to be rather absorbed in the men . ( WALLACE comes back with a filmy scarf which he throws over MADGE  --  standing back of her . ) Thanks so much . MRS . BOUCICAULT Tell Mrs. Brown I want her . ( WALLACE goes to the tea table where TOWNLEY introduces him to KITTY . ) LIVINGSTON Is n't it a trifle unfortunate that Dierdre has gone in for Browns too  --  so near her wedding day ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Stuff ! Nonsense ! What do you mean ? LIVINGSTON ( absorbed in draping her scarf about her shoulders as effectively as possible ) Would you like me to be perfectly frank , dear ? MRS . BOUCICAULT I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Say it . Say it . LIVINGSTON I thought when I saw them together last night the sooner you got rid of him the  --  ( BOB comes out through the hall entrance . He has changed to afternoon flannels. ) p. 36 MRS . BOUCICAULT It 's just as well you came along before we said it . LIVINGSTON I was going to say something very charming about you , Mr. Brown . ( She smiles and purrs at BOB , who goes to stand back of the sofa . ) MRS . BOUCICAULT She was asking me to let her be perfectly frank . BOB That 's always ominous . What a lovely frock , Mrs. Livingston . LIVINGSTON Oh , do you like it ? I 'm glad . BOB At least you make it seem lovely . I think a woman is well dressed when we ca n't tell where her own charm stops and her clothes begin . LIVINGSTON You 're so understanding . Oh , ( As BOB starts towards the terrace . ) I wonder if you 'd be sweet enough to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillows from the large chair back of him ) Which one will you have ? Green or blue ? LIVINGSTON A green one , I think . ( KITTY is out of sight  --  having gone to the Left on the terrace with the men . As BOB lifts the pillows KITTY 'S laugh suddenly rings out . BOB , hearing it  --  stops  --  and stands rigidly waiting  --  holding the two pillows. ) p. 37 LIVINGSTON ( turning to see why BOB has n't given her the cushion ) Green  --  that 's blue . BOB Oh . ( He mechanically gives a pillow to MADGE . KITTY comes across the terrace followed by TOWNLEY , BRUCE and WALLACE . Laughing , she goes to MRS . BOUCICAULT  --  stopping above her chair . ) TOWN Tell that last one to Mrs. Boucicault , Mrs. Brown . She 'll love it . MRS . BOUCICAULT You two Browns must know each other . Mr. Bob Brown  --  this is Mrs. Courtland Brown . ( There is a slight pause . MRS . BOUCICAULT turns to look at KITTY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep breath  --  looking at BOB ) How wonderful you long legged Americans are ! I 've been avoiding you in Paris  --  but it is wonderful to see you again . BOB ( in level tones , looking steadily at KITTY ) Do you mean that ? TOWN Do n't flatter yourself too much , Brown . She thinks we all have long legs . p. 38 KITTY Has anybody got a cigarette ? ( The three men near her offer her one . ) Oh , not three . That 's my unlucky number . The third of June was my wedding day , today is the third of August , and three years ago  --  thanks . ( Taking a cigarette from one , and a light from another . ) BOB ( not taking his eyes away from KITTY ) What were you going to say  --  Mrs. Brown ? Did anything unlucky happen to you three years ago ? KITTY ( as WALLACE lights her cigarette ) I thought so then . I 've grown wiser since . Have you ever been in California , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . ( Moving a little towards BOB . ) BOB Yes  --  I have  --  but I do n't seem to remember the Courtland Browns . KITTY Courtland was my maiden name . I took it back after my divorce of course , and I 'm crazy about it . Mrs. Courtland Brown . Not bad , eh ? TOWN No  --  if one must be a Brown  --  Courtland certainly helps . KITTY That 's the way I feel about it . Perhaps you do n't mind being Brown . I did horribly . p. 39 BOB You seem to have got rid of it pretty successfully . KITTY Where 's that nice girl you were telling me about , Boucicault ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Where is she , Bob ? BOB I left her in the pool . She would n't come out . LIVINGSTON ( still on the sofa ) I 'm Madge Livingston , Mrs. Brown . Nobody seems to be introducing us . KITTY ( going to MADGE with gracious charm and puting out her hand ) Oh , how do you do . LIVINGSTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm grateful . MRS . BOUCICAULT Go get your tea , Bob . ( BOB staring at KITTY , does n't hear . ) Do n't stand around looking indefinite , Bob ! Tea ! BOB What ? Oh  --  yes  --  thanks . I 'll have about the longest drink of Scotch I 've ever had in my life  --  I think . ( He goes out to the tea table . ) KITTY ( watching him as he goes ) There 's something strangely familiar about that man . p. 40 TOWN I dare say all Browns have something in common . LESSING ( coming from the house fresh and handsome in sport clothes  --  seeing KITTY and going to her ) I 'm awfully glad you got here . Gran 's keen about you . Get me some food , will you , Bruce ? ( BRUCE goes to the tea table . ) KITTY If I were a man I should fall in love with her at once . ( KITTY says this at BOB as he comes back with his drink and goes down Left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOUCICAULT at Right Center . ) TOWN That 's what we all do . ( TOWNLEY is leaning lazily against the piano . ) LESSING I have n't noticed any special ardor on your part . TOWN If I seem cold it 's because I 'm deep . LIVINGSTON But the one she 's going to marry is so beautifully in love with her . KITTY Which one is that ? Mr. Brown ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Stop your monkey tricks , Kitty . ( Hitting KITTY 's chair with her stick quickly . ) I told you it was this boy  --  this nice boy Bruce . p. 41 LESSING Thanks , darling . ( As BRUCE comes back to her with a sandwich and a highball . ) Are you a nice boy ? KEEN I think I am . LIVINGSTON Are n't they a beautiful pair ? ( BRUCE and DIERDRE standing together , take a foolish pose . ) I hope you 're going to be married in this dear quaint little church out here , Dierdre , instead of in town . The lines are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to sit in the chair at Center ) The lines ? Yes  --  very good indeed . KITTY Well , at least that 's something . Good lines in a church are a much better reason than most people have for getting married . LIVINGSTON Are n't you going to do that , Dierdre ? TOWN We could work up something very nice . The wedding procession walking over the grass  --  with garlands in our hands . What ? Tum  --  tum  --  te  --  tum  --  tum  --  tum . ( Singing the wedding march and moving about a little . ) KEEN Personally I 'd rather be married by a policeman on the corner  --  no fuss . ( Leaning on one of the pillars under the balcony ) p. 42 MRS . BOUCICAULT How do you like Madge 's idea , Dierdre  --  the wedding here ? You can have the whole place for the autumn if you want it . LESSING ( a little absently , drinking her highball as she stands back of the sofa at Left ) Thanks . TOWN Your enthusiasm thrills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves will be turning and the vines on the stone wall will be  --  Mrs. Brown , did you notice it as you drove in ? KITTY Oh , yes , I think I did . I was married in a little church too  --  But it was spring  --  Everything was just beginning  --  instead of dying . It was the most perfect June that ever was  --  of course . BOB You must have been a perfect bride , Mrs. Brown . KITTY I was . I believed it all . The holy sacrament and everything . There never was such sunshine as it fell across the altar . There never were such flowers  --  and such bridesmaids . They wore large soft hats and green tulle frocks . Darlings  --  every one of them . They all have their divorces now . ( The others laugh a little with the exception of BOB and MADGE. ) p. 43 BOB ( keeping his eyes steadily on KITTY ) I hope the bridegroom was fairly satisfactory at the time . KITTY He was the most perfect part of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any place  --  ever was . Was n't your wedding like that , Mrs. Livingston ? LIVINGSTON ( shocked  --  and with excessive dignity ) A wedding is a very beautiful thing  --  always . KITTY Are you still sentimental about your wedding  --  Mr. Livingston ? GRAINGER ( embarrassed , when he realizes KITTY is speaking to him ) I 've never had a wedding and my name is Grainger . ( He rises and goes out onto the terrace . ) KITTY Oh  --  how stupid I am . Sorry . ( There is a swift exchange of amused glances between DIERDRE , BRUCE and TOWNLEY . ) KITTY ( to DIERDRE and BRUCE , as DIERDRE sits in the chair which WALLACE left  --  and BRUCE stands near her ) You both look so clever . Why do n't you do something entirely new ? Why go on doing the same old things you know wo n't work ? p. 44 TOWN Yes , why not evolve something called marriage which the human animal could have some reasonable hope of making a success of ? BOB For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new arrangement do you think might make marriage a success ? Have you evolved a solution ? You seem so cheerful about it you must have thought of something pretty good . KITTY ( still sitting at Right Center ) I have n't got far  --  but some graceful arrangement with all the little annoying things like love and fidelity entirely left out . It 's absolutely fatal to marry the ones we 're in love with . Do n't you think so , Mrs. Livingston ? LIVINGSTON My marriage was a success  --  a great success  --  and I ca n't bear this flippant cynical talk about the most sacred thing in the world . You have n't given me the glass of water , Wallace . GRAINGER Oh , I 'm so sorry . ( Going to tea table to get it . ) KITTY ( rising ) I 'd love to walk about and see the place . TOWN May I come with you and point out the best features ? MRS . BOUCICAULT No , you may not . I need you , Townley . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one lazy enough to put up with my knee . I think it most appropriate that Mr. Brown should show Mrs. Brown about . ( WALLACE brings the glass of water to MADGE. ) p. 45 BOB ( going to KITTY ) So do I. There 's one spot that reminds me of something I used to be awfully keen about . I 'd like to show it to you . KITTY How sweet of you ! But Mr. Grainger has already promised to take me about . You said the view is especially lovely from  --  where did you say  --  Mr. Grainger ? GRAINGER ( with a quick glance at MADGE ) Well  --  a  --  are your shoes all right for it ? KITTY My shoes are all right for anything . ( Going towards WALLACE . ) Bouci , I broke ten engagements today to get here , but it was worth it . I had no idea I was going to run into anything as delightful as this . Life 's so much more unexpected than anything we can possibly make up  --  is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a  --  little excited that you are Mr. Grainger instead of Mr. Livingston . ( She takes WALLACE onto the terrace . They move out of sight . ) LIVINGSTON ( rising and standing with the glass of water in her hand ) Well  --  really  --  what sort of a person is she , Boucicault ? p. 46 MRS . BOUCICAULT ( in her chair at Right ) When a woman talks as much as that you may be sure she does n't mean much . Is n't that so , Bob ? BOB I think it would be rather hard to say  --  about the lady in question . ( He takes the glass from MADGE and goes out onto the terrace  --  putting both glasses on the table  --  and moves out of sight at Right . ) LIVINGSTON She 's quite obvious  --  it seems to me . ( She sweeps out through the hall . ) LESSING Did n't you love it when she called Wallace Mr. Livingston ? You need n't tell me she is n't on . MRS . BOUCICAULT ( rising ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me my stick . Bruce , where 's my parasol ? ( TOWNLEY gives her the stick which is leaning against her chair . BRUCE goes onto the terrace to get her parasol which he has left there . ) Somebody go in the house and amuse Madge . TOWN ( following MRS . BOUCICAULT as she moves towards the terrace ) You do n't expect me to amuse you  --  do you ? p. 47 MRS . BOUCICAULT Now do n't talk , Townley  --  I 'm tired of you all . ( She moves off across the terrace like a ship  --  and out at Left  --  TOWNLEY in her wake . ) KEEN ( coming down Center as DIERDRE sits in BOUCICAULT 's chair at Right ) Awfully nice for some tennis now . Want to play ? LESSING Um  --  no  --  I do n't believe I do  --  thanks . KEEN Why not ? LESSING Well  --  I seem to have done enough . I think I 'll call it a day . KEEN It 's been a pretty dumb day for me . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  do n't you think it 's rather a good idea not to be together every minute ? KEEN No I do n't . Every minute I 'm not with you is just so much time wasted . LESSING Now , Bruce , old thing , you ca n't keep that up . KEEN You bet I can keep it up  --  for the rest of my life . LESSING You know you get bored with me , once in a while . p. 48 KEEN ( going a little closer to her ) Listen . If I was ever bored with you for a second  --  I would n't want to marry you . LESSING ( trying to evade his seriousness ) Now , darling  --  KEEN ( getting stronger as he goes on ) And that 's just exactly the way you felt about me till exactly three days ago when this Brown guy have in sight . I 'm jealous as a pup and pretty much scared and I think you 're making a congenital idiot of yourself . LESSING Sweet mood you 're in . ( BOB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Oh , do n't go , Bob . We 're not going to fight . KEEN Well what are we going to do ? LESSING Must we do anything ? BOB I 've got a lot of things to do inside . LESSING No , you have n't . You 're only  --  KITTY ( Coming back from the terrace ) These shoes wo n't do , after all . I 'm going to get some others . BOB Mrs. Brown  --  I 'm awfully anxious to ask you something about California  --  if you 'll be good enough to give me just a minute . p. 49 GRAINGER ( who has followed KITTY in ) I 'll come right back and wait for you here . LESSING ( rising ) Is this going to be a secret conference ? Do you want us to go ? KEEN Yes he does . Come on with me  --  if you can bear it . ( Giving DIERDRE a push as they go off across the terrace to the Right . ) BOB ( after a pause ) Why did you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are  --  at once ? KITTY Why did n't you ? BOB I could n't speak . It was  --  KITTY Neither could I. It was all so quick . If we 'd blurted it out at once  --  but we did n't  --  and it 's infinitely better this way . Much more graceful . BOB It 's ridiculous . I 'm going to tell them now . KITTY Oh no you 're not . I refuse to be made  --  a  --  conspicuous . It 's done now  --  and much more comfortable this way  --  for everybody . Why spoil everybody 's week end about a thing that is of no importance really ? We were bound to run into each other , some time , some place . p. 50 BOB I do n't like it . There 's no reason in the world why we should n't tell them . KITTY There 's no reason in the world why we should . What possible difference can it make to anybody in any way ? It will only be for such a little while . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially this one . BOB Do you want me to go in town ? KITTY ( turning back to look at BOB ) And leave this nice girl ? How absurd ! BOB She 's going to marry the boy . KITTY Oh , surely not . BOB What ? KITTY That half baked boy ? He is n't up to her . She 's ready for life . She 's gorgeous . I must tell you something . Boucci sent for me to take you away from her . Now you know that 's rather good . ( She laughs . ) BOB You ca n't be as hard as you seem . KITTY You did n't expect me to be soft  --  did you ? BOB You 're making them misunderstand you . They think you 're a hard boiled woman of the world  --  to put it mildly . Is that what you want them to think ? p. 51 KITTY I think it 's all a very amusing situation myself . For goodness sake , let 's be gay about it . BOB I refuse to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this is uncomfortable what would it be if you told ? Curiosity  --  watching . Why did it happen ?  --  Who began it ? What was it ?  --  Feeling so sorry for me because I lost you . BOB Oh  --  KITTY Spoiling the girl 's fun . BOB Absurd . KITTY ( with sudden fire ) I wo n't have it all brought back . It 's a very trivial thing to ask  --  it seems to me . I do ask it . I  --  I shall leave at once if you 're going to do it . BOB If you put it that way  --  I wo n't . KITTY Thanks . GRAINGER ( coming back from the hall ) I hope I have n't kept you waiting . KITTY ( after a slight pause  --  remembering ) Oh  --  my shoes . I wo n't be a minute . ( She gets her coat from the piano quickly and crosses to the hall entrance . ) Mr. Brown and I have found a distant relation  --  by marriage  --  but very distant . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The same as Act One . Time : Two days later  --  Sunday evening after dinner . At curtain : MADGE LIVINGSTON comes into the room from the hall  --  very distinguished in a floating evening gown peculiar to herself . She is shaken with nervous excitement . WALLACE GRAINGER follows  --  trying to quiet her . GRAINGER But Madge  --  dearest  --  LIVINGSTON I can understand the others  --  but for you to be acting as if you 'd never seen anything like her before in your  --  GRAINGER She amuses me . She 's refreshing . Why not ? I 'm stale , Madge  --  stale  --  stale  --  stale ! LIVINGSTON You mean I do n't inspire you any more . GRAINGER Let 's go outside . It 's hot here . LIVINGSTON ( with sudden tragic tears ) Oh , Wallace  --  dearest  --  if what we have is n't perfect  --  if it is n't the most beautiful thing in the world it does n't justify itself . p. 54 GRAINGER Why are you saying these things now ? Nothing 's different . You  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . MRS . BOUCICAULT is important in her characteristic evening gown . DIERDRE is striking and colorful . ) LIVINGSTON ( wiping her eyes ) Forgive me for leaving the table , Boucicault . I could n't listen to another one of her stories . MRS . BOUCICAULT ( sitting on the sofa at Left ) I do n't think they even know you 've left the table , my dear . LESSING Kitty does you bet . Her technique is marvellous . Think I 'll go back . I do n't want to miss anything . MRS . BOUCICAULT Stay where you are . Here 's the coffee . ( As WHITMAN and STRUTHERS come from Left on the terrace with the coffee , liqueurs , whiskey , soda , etc. which they put on the table outside . ) Keep it outside , Whitman , and put the bridge tables out there . WHITMAN ( coming into the room ) Pardon me , madam . I 'm afraid there 's too strong a breeze for playing outside . p. 55 MRS . BOUCICAULT Outside . WHITMAN ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , madam . MRS . BOUCICAULT He 's probably right . He always is  --  damn him . Go back , Wallace , and start them out . I want to get at the bridge or it will be midnight before we begin . ( WALLACE hesitates  --  glancing at MADGE who has moved to the piano where she carefully repairs her makeup . ) Well  --  what 's the matter with you ?  --  Too strong a breeze ? GRAINGER Why do we hesitate when you give orders ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Because you like to hear me bellow , I s'pose  --  so I 'll think I 'm having my own way . Go on . Do as I tell you . ( WALLACE goes out through the hall . ) LESSING I 'm crazy about you , Gran . You 're so onto yourself . MRS . BOUCICAULT Tell one of them to bring my coffee . I 'll have it here .

If Bob comes out tell him where I am . MRS . BOUCICAULT He seems to be lingering too  --  just as hypnotized with Kitty as the rest of ' em . LESSING You mean you want him to be . You 're a scream , Gran . LIVINGSTON How in the world did you happen to ask her while Dierdre is here ? LESSING While I 'm here ? Do n't you love it ? You do n't have to put a crimp in your famous hospitality on my account  --  do you , pet ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Go on outside if you 're going . LESSING You 're awfully cunning .

LIVINGSTON Has the man you 're going to marry nothing to say about you falling in love with somebody else ? LESSING Has the man you 're married to nothing to say about the one you 're in love with ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Stop that kind of talk , Dierdre . LESSING I do n't know why you expect me to be so different from anybody else . MRS . BOUCICAULT I expect you to go about your business of marrying Bruce  --  and  --  let everybody else alone . LESSING And I expect to be let alone , Gran . MRS . BOUCICAULT ( pounding the floor with her stick ) Stop it ! You 're forgetting who you are . LESSING I know damn well who I am . That 's why I 'm going to manage my own business .

BOUCICAULT No  --  but it would have been a darned good thing for us both if I had . She was the meanest old woman I ever knew . LIVINGSTON Dierdre is going headlong right at the man . It 's the openness  --  the casualness that shocks me . MRS . BOUCICAULT Oh  --  you 're shocked  --  are you ? LIVINGSTON Are n't you ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Yes  --  but I think I prefer her brazenness to your slyness . LIVINGSTON ( going to sit in the large chair at Right ) You hurt me . MRS . BOUCICAULT Poppycock ! Do n't pose with me , Madge . She 's the only one of the whole pack I care a hang about . I love her . I 've actually been fool enough to let myself love her . I 'd begun to have some pride in her . I 'd begun to think the good old stock was coming out . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And no matter what happens I ca n't blame her . I blame myself and my respectable friends and the disrespectable things they are doing . p. 59 LIVINGSTON ( rising ) I wo n't stand the things you say to me ! MRS . BOUCICAULT All right . Remind me to speak to Whitman about the soup . I wo n't stand it either . ( BOB strolls in from the hall and laughs as he hears this . ) Come here and give me a light , Bob . Are they moving in there at all yet ? BOB Not yet . I thought I 'd come out and remind you that you have some male guests , Boucicault . I think they 've settled down for the evening . I do n't think they 're coming out at all . ( Going to MRS . BOUCICAULT and opening his cigarette case . ) LIVINGSTON ( standing near the piano ) Too fascinated with the fascinating MRS . Brown ?

( Giving MRS . BOUCICAULT a light . ) LIVINGSTON ( frowning at the cigar ) How can you , Boucicault ? p. 60 MRS . BOUCICAULT ( with a puff of satisfaction ) They 've saved me from being " among those present " on many an occasion . The second time I met King Edward and he called me by name  --  right off the trigger  --  I said , " Ah , your majesty , it 's my cigar you remember . " And he said , " Ah , no , madam , your personality is so much stronger than your cigar . " He was a great man .

BOUCICAULT ( taking the coffee ) I thought you 'd fallen in it and died . LESSING Bob , Gran thinks Kitty 's much more alluring than I am . How about it ? Do you ? BOB You both have your points .

We heard her  --  her first night in Paris . You said , " Thank heaven for somebody more diverting than my guests . " p. 62 MRS . BOUCICAULT See here  --  when you quote me  --  make it agreeable . KITTY ( standing before the keyboard ) Nobody would believe you said it , lamb . Will someone be sweet enough to move the piano  --  just a little nearer ?

MADGE slowly realizes that KITTY has imitated her and rises with great hauteur and sweeps out onto the terrace . ) KITTY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KITTY ) Yes  --  very successfully . GRAINGER ( leaning over the piano at the upper side of it  --  not having seen MADGE leave the room ) Do you know " Paree " ? KITTY Yes .

BOUCICAULT as he too leans on the piano at the end ) That 's not what he thinks he 's singing . p. 63 GRAINGER Certainly it is . It 's a good song . KITTY ( playing again ) Come along . LESSING Give the song a chance , Wallie . ( KITTY plays  --  nodding to them all to make them sing . WALLACE goes on with the song  --  this time TOWNLEY and BRUCE sing with him  --  KITTY joining in a little . BOB whistles without watching the group at the piano .

KITTY ( laughing ) Exactly . ( TOWNLEY strolls out onto the terrace . ) LESSING ( listening to the music ) What is that , Bob ? ( BOB does n't hear her . ) KEEN For Heaven 's sake  --  Dierdre  --  What is this ? Have you gone off your head about him ? LESSING What shall we do about it if I have ? KEEN Come outside .

BOUCICAULT 'S neck . ) MRS . BOUCICAULT Is it any good ? LESSING ( coming from the terrace and going to sit on the sofa ) Granny never knows whether the objects d'art she collects around her neck are junk or pearls without price . KITTY Where did it come from , Bouci ? MRS . BOUCICAULT A pawn shop probably . It ca n't be worth much . KITTY Why not ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Because I know who gave it to me . KITTY Who did ? MRS . BOUCICAULT My late husband . ( Turning away . ) Where are Madge and Wallace ? ( She goes onto the terrace and off at Left . ) TOWN ( who has come back from the terrace during these lines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Are you wearing anything your late husband gave you ? p. 69 KITTY ( touching a small string of pearls ) Oh , yes  --  these  --  modest but pure . BOB Do you wear them to remember him by ? KITTY No  --  I remember him very well . Quite distinctly in fact . He was one of the most attractive men I 've ever known , and as men go  --  I still think so . TOWN My God  --  why did you divorce him then ? If a woman feels that way about a man , why does n't she hang on to him ? KITTY He did n't hang on to me . TOWN Oh , come ! KITTY No  --  really . BOB That 's very interesting . Just what do you mean by not hanging on ? LESSING Why did you divorce him ? KITTY ( after a pause , looking at DIERDRE ) Because of a girl so much like you , that it 's funny  --  almost .

They stop under the balcony at Left to talk. ) p. 70 TOWN I 'm so grateful to Boucicault for you , Kitty . Usually I 'm called in to take on a woman with a club foot or something  --  because she amused Bouci once in  --  Labrador . When she gets her here , she wants to shoot her and sends for me . KITTY ( sitting in the large chair at Right ) Have you got a cigarette , Townley ? ( TOWNLEY goes to sit on the seat below KITTY 'S chair and lights her cigarette . They talk in low tones . MRS . BOUCICAULT comes from the terrace trying to hear what DIERDRE is saying to BOB as they stand under the balcony at Left . ) LESSING Let 's hop in the pool after while . It 's so beastly hot . BOB Is it ? I do n't think so . LESSING Oh  --  you do n't need the pool to cool off . Why the sudden drop in temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and glowing and mysterious as ever ? BOB You 're marvellous . LESSING What are you looking at ? ( As he glances at KITTY. ) p. 71 BOB I 'm looking at you .

LESSING Do n't be so paternal . Come on . You need one yourself . ( DIERDRE goes out  --  BOB follows her . ) KITTY Townie , are you trying to persuade me you 've fallen in love with me or is this just your week-end charm ? MRS .

KITTY ( calling to TOWNLEY as he goes ) And if you return  --  bring me some very hot coffee .

Get Bob Brown away from Dierdre ? p. 72 KITTY ( rising quickly ) Really , Bouci , this is rather disgusting . You 're putting a ridiculous thing up to me  --  an impossible thing . MRS . BOUCICAULT You 're efficient enough with the others . Why are you so mulish about it ? This is the first time I 've seen you even speak to Bob . I 've been watching Dierdre . I heard something she said to him just now . Help me , Kitty . KITTY I 've been watching her too . She is in love with him . Why on earth do n't you let them alone ? Is n't your Bob Brown as good as the other one for her to marry  --  better  --  since he 's the one she really wants ? MRS . BOUCICAULT He has n't the slightest intention of marrying her  --  and she 's throwing herself at him . Hot headed young daredevil ! Anything could happen . I 'm frightened , Kitty . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it , Townley ? Go away . Go away and mind your own business . TOWN This is my business . Do n't snort at me , angel . I was sent for this . MRS .

They 're all out here now . p. 73 KITTY ( reaching for the coffee ) Oh , do n't take that away from me . I ca n't bear it . ( TOWNLEY turns to KITTY  --  giving her the cup . They stand at Right , talking . ) MRS . BOUCICAULT ( as MADGE and WALLACE come in from the hall ) Well  --  where have you been ? I thought you were on the terrace . KITTY ( to TOWNLEY ) I 've never seen her as bad as this . TOWN Old girl 's on the rampage about something . MRS . BOUCICAULT Where are you , Townley ?

WALLACE starts after her . TOWNLEY and MRS . BOUCICAULT go off Left . ) KITTY ( dropping her handkerchief and imitating MADGE ) Oh  --  my handkerchief . ( WALLACE goes down to KITTY . He picks up her handkerchief  --  gives it to her and stands before her  --  flattered and having lost his head a little. ) p. 74 GRAINGER The last verse has just come to me . KITTY Is it as lovely as the others ? GRAINGER More so . It 's you . KITTY I 'm thrilled pink . That 's one thing that 's never happened to me  --  poetry . GRAINGER I have n't done this in years  --  you know . " Shadows of understanding in her eyes . Shadows of happiness gone  --  " KITTY Oh ! Shadows .

KITTY I 'd love to  --  but where can we go ? MRS . BOUCICAULT ( coming into sight with TOWNLEY up Left on the terrace ) Now look at that ass ! Wallace  --  Madge is waiting for that drink .

( BRUCE goes back again . ) TOWN ( as he goes up to table with the cup and off Left ) I am a worm . Why do n't I turn ? KITTY ( rising and taking her fan from the small table below the large chair ) The situation is getting more amusing every minute . Is n't it ? p. 78 BOB No . I do n't think it is . It 's getting more ridiculous every minute . We ought to have told them in the first place . Let 's tell them now . It would clear the whole atmosphere . KITTY The atmosphere does n't need clearing . Surely you are n't embarrassed  --  are you ? Do n't let my being here make the slightest difference to you in any way . BOB About Dierdre  --  you mean ? KITTY About anything .

I should have said it was something very serious . But perhaps I 'm no judge of that either . BOB You 're implying a lot  --  but you surely do n't think I was skunk enough to go after her . KITTY ( moving away ) And you surely do n't think you have to explain anything to me . BOB I want you to know how it is . I was flirting with her  --  a little  --  a little too much  --  perhaps  --  before you came  --  but seeing you has made me stop . p. 79 KITTY Oh  --  sorry .

Robert is getting to be more like you every minute . And Katherine is marvellous . BOB ( looking at her eagerly and moving a little towards her ) Like you ? KITTY Yes  --  only more so . BOB I hope she 'll be just exactly like you  --  just exactly  --  as you were , I mean . p. 80 KITTY She wo n't , I assure you . She 'll be much more intelligent  --  and much more prepared . I believe in preparedness . BOB You 've changed , Kitty . KITTY I hope so . Three years of Paris ought to improve any woman . BOB You seem to have had a pretty good time .

I 've made a good connection with a firm in Paris , and I 'm going to have a shop out home . BOB What ? KITTY Yes . It will keep me going back and forth , which I shall adore . I can stand one place because I 'll always know I 'm going to the other . p. 81 BOB Um . There 's something in that  --  possibly . Though the further I go the more I see I 'd like to stay put  --  once I get in the right place . KITTY Are there any right places ? BOB There 's just one  --  for me . But I 'm not in it .

BOB You 'll do nothing of the kind . KITTY Certainly I will . BOB We 'll see about that . KITTY There 's something about one 's own money  --  making it and spending it  --  that has  --  I know now how a man feels  --  only  --  he takes it for granted  --  and it 's a new thrill to me . BOB And when you 're not working ? KITTY Like you I 've been amusing myself with anything and everything that came my way . I know how a man feels about that too . p. 82 BOB You 're very glib but I do n't know just what you mean . What  --  do you  --  exactly ? LESSING ( coming on from the terrace with her high-ball ) What is this ? Are you trying to vamp Bob  --  Kitty ? KITTY ( still sitting ) You evidently do n't think I could . LESSING I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get any man you want . Do n't you , Bob ? BOB ( putting the chair back and going down Right Center ) There does n't seem to be any doubt about that . KITTY ( to DIERDRE ) What would you do if I did ? Would it be a joke or a tragedy to you ? LESSING ( lifting her face to BOB ) Bob knows what it would mean to me . Do n't you , Bob ? KITTY Oh  --  well  --  if Bob knows what you mean  --  and you know what he means  --  nothing else matters . Does it ? MRS . BOUCICAULT ( coming in from the terrace ) We have to play in here after all . The wind blows the cards away  --  confound it ! p. 83 KITTY Are you going to let me play with you , Bouci ? ( Standing up and moving out of the way as WHITMAN comes in with a card table and chairs . ) MRS . BOUCICAULT Yes  --  with Bob  --  over here . ( STRUTHERS has brought on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) KITTY ( to BOB ) You 'd much better play over there . If you take me on you 'll have to be a good loser as well as a good player . BOB It depends on what I 'm losing  --  how good I am . LESSING You 're going to play with me . BOB I do n't think I can . ( DIERDRE draws BOB to the table at Right and goes on talking to him a little desperately in low tones . KITTY has watched this an instant  --  and then turns to TOWNLEY who is standing at MRS . BOUCICAULT 'S Right . KITTY , TOWNLEY and MRS . BOUCICAULT all talk at once  --  very gaily for a moment . The SERVANTS go out . MADGE and WALLACE are seen on the terrace . ) KITTY ( heard above the others after a moment ) You play against me , Townley . You 're probably worse than I am. p. 84 TOWN I 'm rather good  --  but erratic . KITTY That 's what all rotten players say . Where do you want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that light over my shoulder , Townley . ( TOWNLEY gets the lamp  --  which is up Left . ) KITTY ( as she sits at Right of table ) I need more than a light over my shoulder when I play with you , Bouci . If I did n't love you so much dearest , I 'd hate you . TOWN ( coming to sit below the table ) I do hate her  --  when I play cards with her . MRS . BOUCICAULT How do you suppose I feel about you  --  when I have to play with you ? BOB ( Sitting below the table at Right ) Be careful , Dierdre ! You do n't know what you 're doing . LESSING ( Sitting at Right of Right table ) I know what I 'm doing and what I want . Oh , Bob  --  I 'm crazy about you . MRS . BOUCICAULT Bob  --  come over here . KITTY ( as BOB crosses to the Left table ) Too bad Mr. Brown ca n't be in two places at once . p. 85 BOB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do for me . ( BRUCE comes on to the terrace from the Right and goes quickly down to DIERDRE  --  sitting above the table  --  pleading with her to stop drinking . ) KITTY What are we playing for ? BOB Anything you say . TOWN Anything you say  --  so long as you make it about twenty-five cents a point  --  for Bouci . KITTY Oh my soul ! Who 's going to pay my losses ? Are you ? TOWN Yes  --  if you 'll take a bad check . ( They cut and deal , all talking at once . ) KEEN ( heard at the other table ) Put on the brakes , Dierdre . You 've had enough . LESSING Do n't be young . KEEN For heaven 's sake , let up . Why do you do it ? What 's there in it ? LESSING Not a thing . ( Turning her glass upside down . ) Not a damned thing . Go put something in it . p. 86 KEEN You ca n't have any more . ( WALLACE has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game .

And how ! GRAINGER Go on , child  --  call it a spade . LESSING That 's all right by me . Funny looking little things are n't they ? Hi  --  Whitman  --  ( Banging her glass on the table . ) KEEN Let up , Dierdre . KITTY ( who is playing while BOB is dummy ) Do n't tell me I took that trick , Mr. Brown . There must be something wrong . BOB ( rather grimly ) You either played it very cleverly or very innocently  --  I 'm not sure which . p. 88 KITTY Innocence is not my long suit . MRS . BOUCICAULT ( throwing down a card and shouting at TOWNLEY ) You should have trumped my ace  --  idiot . TOWN What ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Certainly . It 's the only way in God 's name you could make it . TOWN Are you spoofing me ? KITTY No , she 's cursing you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the most brilliant thing you can do is to do the thing you 've been trying all your life not to do .

LESSING Why should I leave the room ? I 'm a great deal more decent than anybody in it . ( Sitting heavily in the chair which MADGE left . ) KITTY ( lifting her head quickly and throwing her cards on the table ) I do n't think there 's any doubt about that . Why do n't we all leave the room  --  in the order of our sins ? TOWN That 's a good idea . I 'll start the procession .

I think it 's delightful . LESSING Gran thinks I 'm tight . ( Her head drops a little over the back of the chair . ) KITTY ( going to DIERDRE ) Just chatty  --  are n't you ? I am too  --  when I 've had a drink or two . If this had been me  --  instead of you  --  my word  --  the things I could have told about the first time I fell in love . Could n't you , Mr. Brown ? BOB ( standing at the Left of the table ) I do n't think anybody would be interested . p. 91 KITTY Oh , it 's always amusing .

LIVINGSTON I find this excessively disagreeable , MRS . Brown . LESSING Bob , you tell Kitty how it is with us . BOB Do n't , Dierdre ! LESSING You would n't take him away from me , would you , Kitty ? You musti n't now . KITTY No danger of that  --  is there , Mr. Brown ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Dierdre , leave this room ! LESSING No ! I want to tell  --  KITTY Come on , dear . Come outside and tell me . I know just how you feel . How could you resist Bob . MRS . BOUCICAULT Katherine ! Are you upholding Dierdre ? KITTY I 'll do my best . She 's a little tall for me. p. 92 MRS . BOUCICAULT Katherine , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm ashamed of you , too . You 've been very naughty with your heavy intrigue . I told you I was n't clever enough for this job . BOB What job ? KITTY Oh , to get you , and have you and hold you , forever . LIVINGSTON Boucicault , I ca n't stand this brazenness ! KITTY Now if it were Wallie you wanted me to take away from somebody  --  there 's no telling what might have happened . ( She smiles at WALLACE  --  much to his excited embarrassment  --  and turns towards the terrace as the CURTAIN FALLS p. 93 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT TWO SCENE II Time : About an hour after Scene I. Place : The balcony onto which KITTY 'S room opens . Narrow steps lead down at the left end . Below the line of the balcony the stage is in darkness . Two long French windows with shutters open onto the balcony  --  one from KITTY 'S room  --  one from a room at the Right . The shutters of the room at Right are closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S windows are open  --  a dim light in the room . At curtain : the stage is empty . PERKINS ( after a moment , from within ) Yes , madam . No  --  I do n't think so , madam . ( A pause . ) I beg pardon ? ( She comes on to the balcony . ) Oh yes it is  --  full . KITTY ( inside  --  not seen ) Ravishing  --  is n't it ? PERKINS It 's very nice , madam  --  if you like it . KITTY Ca n't you do better than that for the moon , Perkins ? PERKINS ( folding the red velvet coat she holds ) I do n't care for it myself . It 's too spooky . p. 94 KITTY ( coming onto the balcony wearing a very charming dressing robe ) Skip along now . MRS . Boucicault needs you and I do n't . And bring my coffee at eight . Do n't wait for me to ring . I 'm taking an early train to town . ( She stands at the railing looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , Perkins . PERKINS Good night , madam . Thank you . ( PERKINS goes in . The glow of a cigarette is seen below in the darkness . ) KITTY ( laughing softly as she looks over the railing ) Not really ! TOWN Inevitably . KITTY You 're too amusing . TOWN I 'm coming up . KITTY Oh  --  I thought you were taking a walk . TOWN ( starting up the steps ) My God , how they creak ! KITTY You do n't mind , do you ? TOWN Not if they do n't break down . p. 95 KITTY Shake ' em . How do they feel ? TOWN ( his head and shoulders seen as he climbs up ) Very frail . KITTY Oh ! The whole thing 's coming down ! TOWN That 'll be all right  --  after I get up . How pretty you are in that light ! KITTY You look better yourself . TOWN Where do we sit ? KITTY We do n't . TOWN Oh yes we do . ( Drawing KITTY down onto the top step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TOWN Thanks . KITTY I mean architecturally speaking . TOWN ( looking along the balcony ) Anybody next to you  --  architecturally speaking ? KITTY I have n't seen anyone . Do n't tell me you 'd be  --  embarrassed if you were discovered here ? TOWN I 'd be terribly flattered . Would you be  --  ashamed of me ? p. 96 KITTY Oh  --  most proud . Why should n't I be proud of an irresistible man sitting on my door step ? TOWN No reason  --  so long as you do n't resist him . KITTY ( by way of changing the subject ) Sweet out here . I 'm sorry I did n't discover this before . TOWN So am I  --  KITTY Listen ! There 's a bird  --  way off . TOWN Calling to his mate . I did n't come up here to listen to bird notes  --  you know . ( He kisses her arm . She draws it away . ) TOWN Why that ? Do n't you like me as well as you thought you were going to  --  before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TOWN How is it  --  really  --  Kitty dear ? KITTY You 're a sweet person . I told you that the minute I saw you . TOWN But you 've had two more days of me . How is it now ? KITTY I have n't liked anyone so much in  --  oh , I do n't know when . p. 97 TOWN I have n't liked anyone so much  --  ever . It 's marvellous to like a girl and fall in love with her too . That 's how it is with me  --  Kitty . KITTY You 're perfect . TOWN You 're pretending you do n't believe me  --  but you do . You 're the most  --  Damn ! ( Slapping his ankle . ) KITTY Smoke  --  smoke  --  hard . ( KITTY leans forward  --  her elbows on her knees . ) TOWN What are you thinking about ? KITTY Nothing . TOWN Meaning me ? KITTY No  --  that girl  --  Dierdre Lessing . TOWN You were a peach . Rather messy  --  was n't it ? KITTY It happens so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me slightly ill  --  somehow  --  to see a nice girl get drunk . I suppose I 'm much too fastidious . KITTY Much . TOWN It also rather gets my goat to see them go after a man quite as openly as she went after Brown . p. 98 KITTY I 'm awfully sorry for her . TOWN In the name of heaven why ? KITTY She 's in love with him . TOWN She 's made a fool of herself . KITTY Oh , I do n't know . He must have encouraged her . TOWN Well  --  What 's a man to do ? Brown 's a bit fed up , I should say . Men are . Even I  --  in all modesty  --  prefer to do my own pursuing  --  but they wo n't let me . KITTY Poor you ! Besieged , I s'pose . TOWN That 's why I 'm so mad about you  --  Kitty . You 've kept me  --  a  --  KITTY What ? TOWN Wondering . KITTY Is the wondering all over ? TOWN Um  --  when in doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever saw . I wanted to kiss the right one all through dinner , especially with the salad . KITTY Why did n't you ? TOWN I 'll do it now . KITTY Oh no . It would be so commonplace now  --  and it would have been so diverting for everybody then . p. 99 TOWN You were letting Grainger divert you in the other ear  --  in French . KITTY I had no idea he was so brilliant . TOWN See here  --  ought I to be worried about Grainger ? KITTY You ought not to be worried about anything . TOWN At first I was afraid of Brown . When I got on to Boucicault 's scheme I thought you 'd mow him down just to please the old girl . I thought it would rouse your sporting blood when you saw the layout . KITTY Ah , but you see  --  you were here . ( A light is seen through the shutters in the room at Right . ) TOWN I 've fallen in love with you , Kitty . What are you going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner tomorrow night . We 'll go on from here . TOWN We 'll go on now . KITTY ( standing up ) We 'll say good night now  --  and drop down this time . Do n't risk the steps . TOWN ( stepping onto the balcony beside KITTY ) Do n't be in such a hurry to get rid of me. p. 100 KITTY I 'm only giving you a  --  suggestion . TOWN I do n't need it . I know where I 'm going . KITTY Oh , do you ? TOWN So do you . Do n't you ? KITTY You think so ? TOWN You 're very wise and very sure  --  are n't you ? I love you beautifully , Kitty . What are you going to do with me ? KITTY ( moving to her door ) I 'm going to say good night to you now . TOWN But I have n't told you how I  --  KITTY But go now while I 'm still dying to hear it . TOWN ( catching her hand ) Why did you let me come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why not ? TOWN Then do n't send me away . KITTY Townie . Keep charming and clever . I want to see you again . Good night . ( He kisses her throat . She moves away from him into her doorway . ) TOWN ( moving beside her ) Kitty , I 'm mad about you . I ca n't go . p. 101 KITTY I like you frightfully , Townley  --  do n't spoil it . TOWN Kiss me good night then  --  KITTY No  --  No ! TOWN But I  --  ( He kisses her . BOB throws open the shutters at Right and comes onto the balcony . KITTY hears the noise and pushes TOWNLEY out of sight , inside her door . ) BOB Kitty ! KITTY Oh  --  it 's your room ! Fancy that ! BOB Kitty , you do n't believe anything that girl said  --  ( KITTY shakes her head at BOB . ) What 's the matter ? No one can hear us . There 's no one about . I do n't know what she told you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything you could object to . KITTY ( calling ) Townley  --  did you find the cigarettes ? Come out . ( A pause . TOWNLEY comes out . ) That 's Mr. Brown 's room . Is n't it amusing ? We were wondering . We 've been sitting on the steps  --  smoking  --  to keep the mosquitoes away . They 're awfully bad tonight  --  are n't they . The vines I s'pose . Mr. Townley was just going . Perhaps you 'll stay now . Perhaps you 'll bring out some chairs , Mr. Brown ? ( The men stare at each other amazed  --  embarrassed . ) No ? Oh  --  well  --  I 'll see you tomorrow night , Townie . Better ring me up in the afternoon at three  --  sharp . I 'll be awfully busy all day . What ? p. 102 TOWN ( after a slight pause ) I 'm afraid I do n't understand quite . KITTY You will . I shall have something frightfully amusing to tell you at dinner . Good night . TOWN It seems Boucicault 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least not her way . That 's what I 'll tell you about . It 's unbelievably funny . TOWN ( coldly ) I see . KITTY Oh do you ! You do n't in the least . This seems to be rather too staggering for you . Do n't be melodramatic I beg . If you want me to dine with you ring me up . If you do n't  --  do n't . Good night . TOWN At three  --  sharp . Good night . Good night , Brown . ( BOB does n't speak . ) KITTY ( putting her hand out impulsively to TOWNLEY ) You 're a darling . ( TOWNLEY takes KITTY 'S hand for an instant  --  and goes down the steps . ) BOB What does it all mean ? KITTY All what ? Townley on my balcony ? That ought not to need an interpretation  --  for you . p. 103 BOB What ? KITTY Yes . Good night . ( She starts to go . ) BOB Is it  --  what it looks like ? KITTY Nothing very novel about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your room ? KITTY That 's a very naive question  --  for you . How silly it all is . I 'm going to bed . Good night . BOB Kitty ! KITTY Yes ? BOB It 's horrible ! I ca n't believe it . It is n't you . KITTY I do n't think you know much about what is  --  or is n't  --  me . BOB I do . You ca n't have changed like this . It simply is not possible . KITTY Why not ? BOB Are you doing this sort of thing all the time ? God  --  what are you laughing at ? KITTY It 's so funny ! BOB No it is n't ! I want you to know I 've absolutely done nothing wrong towards Dierdre Lessing . I 'm horribly sorry and ashamed about the whole thing downstairs  --  and you 've got to tell me exactly what you mean by this . In the name of heaven , why did you let that man come up here ? Is he  --  ( BOB stops suddenly as DIERDRE comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same gown as in Scene I. She stops as she sees KITTY and BOB  --  looking from one to the other with quick suspicion. ) p. 104 KITTY Hello . Come out . Do n't look so suspicious . It 's quite all right  --  I assure you . I 've been sitting on the steps with a man  --  and Mr. Brown was inconsiderate enough to come out at the wrong moment . LESSING ( trying to be at ease  --  but very doubtful ) Oh  --  KITTY The man was Townley  --  if it interests you to know . LESSING Oh I say , Bob  --  It 's a wonder you would n't stay inside . KITTY That 's what I 'm going to do . I 'm going in and stay in . LESSING Do n't go on my account . KITTY Sweet of you  --  but I 've got to pack and I 'm awfully sleepy . LESSING Wait a minute  --  please , Kitty . I know everything I said downstairs  --  and I meant it  --  only I did n't mean to say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came in to talk to Bob about it and since I am here  --  there 's no use pretending I 'm not . So that 's that . BOB You came to say you were sorry . LESSING Oh no I didn't. p. 105 BOB We understand  --  but it was n't a very wise thing for you to do , Dierdre . A  --  MRS.  --  MRS . Brown will go back with you . LESSING What ? KITTY You mean chaperone her back to her room  --  in case somebody else might be strolling about ? BOB Yes  --  that 's just exactly what I mean . LESSING Do n't you love it ? ( DIERDRE and KITTY laugh . ) BOB Listen , Dierdre . You ca n't stay here . LESSING I want to ask Kitty something . She can help me . ( DIERDRE goes closer to KITTY . BOB moves to the right corner of the balcony  --  his back turned to the others . ) KITTY I 'm not so sure of that . I do n't know that I 'd have chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LESSING I 've thought till I 'm woozy  --  but I do n't get anywhere . What shall I do ? I 've promised to marry Bruce but I 'm crazy about Bob . BOB Dierdre  --  stop this . LESSING She knows . I spilled it all down stairs anyway . What would you do  --  Kitty  --  if you were in my place ? p. 106 KITTY If I were in your place  --  I 'm sure I would marry Bob . ( BOB turns to watch KITTY . ) I 'd believe that he was the one man for me  --  and that I 'd be the one woman for him  --  always . I 'd believe that nothing could ever change him . That 's the way I know I 'd feel about Bob  --  but I suppose you 're much too intelligent for that . BOB ( forgetting DIERDRE entirely and going to KITTY ) Are you still laughing ? KITTY Do I sound too old fashioned and sentimental to be true ? BOB Not if you mean it . LESSING Look at me , Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then why do n't you two try it ? You must know pretty well what you want by this time . BOB ( looking steadily at KITTY ) I do know just exactly what I want . I was never so sure as I am this minute . KITTY You may be two of the lucky ones who do find the most wonderful thing in the world . LESSING ( drawing BOB away from KITTY ) Could n't we make it that  --  Bob ? I know now  --  I could . p. 107 BOB Dierdre , you do n't know what you 're doing . You 're only a child . LESSING I 'm not . I love you , Bob . I love you . BOB I blame myself terribly , Dierdre  --  but it 's better for you to know the truth now . I  --  I did n't think for a minute it was  --  like this  --  with you . LESSING Do n't you want to marry me ? BOB Dierdre  --  dear girl  --  it was n't that way at all . LESSING That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was  --  for anything . What 's changed you ? Oh  --  What were you and she doing here  --  alone  --  together ? BOB What ? LESSING ( to KITTY ) Did you take him away from me ? KITTY Did I what ? BOB For God 's sake tell her the truth , Kitty  --  or I will . LESSING You need n't , I know . You did what Gran wanted . BOB You ca n't believe any such rot . LESSING Why would n't I believe it ? Before she came you were crazy about me . Now you 're not . p. 108 BOB Dierdre  --  Kitty and I are  --  KITTY ( stopping BOB with her hand ) Do n't , Bob  --  let it alone  --  it 's better this way . ( To DIERDRE . ) Since I  --  since anything could take him away from you  --  are n't you glad to know it now  --  before you  --  married him ? LESSING Oh  --  you did  --  you did ! BOB Kitty  --  KITTY Do n't , Bob . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's vile  --  it 's beastly ! Right here in grandmother 's house ! KITTY And what are you doing here  --  right in your grandmother 's house ? I suppose you thought you were very brave to come  --  to take life in your own hands and look it straight in the face . Well  --  here we are . If you want to find things out for yourself you 'll have to accept things as they are . You 've found this before you married him  --  instead of afterwards . I think you 're rather to be congratulated . LESSING ( with a half sob ) Oh  --  p. 109 BOB Dierdre , you ca n't stay here . Go to bed and get some sleep and tomorrow we 'll talk this all out clearly and honestly . LESSING I would n't believe anything you said to me . I would n't believe anything  --  ever again . Everything in the world is horrible  --  horrible  --  ( She goes out the way she came . ) KITTY ( after a pause ) I seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  just exactly as Bouci wanted it . BOB I do n't care what the old woman wants . I 'm not going to have her think this rot about you . I 'm going to clear it all up the first thing in the morning . KITTY If you do you 'll spoil it . This is the best thing that could possibly happen to Dierdre . BOB At your expense . KITTY Well , why not be the goat in a good cause once in a lifetime ? BOB But I 'm thinking of you . KITTY And I 'm thinking of her . The whole world will never be so completely smashed for her again . It does n't happen twice . And since you seem to be tired and through , it 's an easy way out for you  --  and I think I 've got rather a kick out of it myself . So let 's call it a day . p. 110 BOB Kitty  --  how much did you mean of what you said about love ? KITTY Now , really , Bob . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young girl , very much in love with you . It was working well , when all of a sudden she believed this pleasant little thing she thought she saw right before her eyes . Very easy for her to believe . A trs sophisticated young person she is . BOB Stop talking about her . Kitty , I 'm more in love with you than I ever was in my life . KITTY Oh  --  Mr. Brown , this is so sudden . BOB I adore you . KITTY It 's the moon . BOB ( taking her by the shoulders and turning her towards him ) Stop this . Look at me . Talk to me like  --  like  --  KITTY Like what ? BOB Like your own honest to God self . You have n't said a real thing to me since you came . KITTY ( getting away from him ) I do n't know any real things  --  do you ? BOB Stop bluffing and hedging . I love you . Does n't that mean anything to you at all ? p. 111 KITTY Yes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much does this Townley thing mean ? KITTY Nothing in particular . Only that you 're not used to seeing other men aware of me . BOB I 'm not used to seeing other men treating you as though they had a right to  --  to  --  KITTY To what ? BOB To come up here . KITTY Townley had a perfect right to come up here . I invited him . BOB God , Kitty , I ca n't stand this . What does it mean ? KITTY It means I like him . BOB And what else ? KITTY I do n't know what else  --  yet . BOB How far has it gone ? KITTY Just as far as  --  as  --  BOB As  --  what ? KITTY As the door . BOB Are you in love with him ? KITTY I always like to think I 'm in love with somebody . p. 112 BOB Is there nothing left of what you used to feel for me ? Is every bit of it gone ? KITTY Every little bit . BOB Is it ? KITTY Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life with other things . BOB What things ? KITTY Things  --  things  --  to take the place of the ones I used to think were everything and found were nothing . BOB What about you  --  yourself ? What 's become of that ? KITTY I find myself a much easier person to live with than I used to be . I do n't take myself as seriously as I used to . BOB Oh , Kitty , you were the sweetest thing in the world , and you still are . KITTY Was I ? I do n't remember . BOB I do n't believe you 've changed . You 're the same adorable thing I loved , and you 're even more so now . Kitty , I  --  I  --  KITTY No  --  no  --  Bob . BOB ( drawing her close in his arms ) Please  --  please  --  darling . p. 113 KITTY Oh , no  --  Bob , not that . BOB I ca n't help it , Kitty . Why ca n't I have you again ? ( He kisses her . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Getting away from him . ) BOB ( after a pause in a low , hard tone ) Is there anybody else ? KITTY Yes . Why not ? BOB Is this the way you 've been living ? Have there been other men ? Have you  --  have you  --  KITTY And if I have , what of it ? ( She stops as a soft whistle is heard from below . ) GRAINGER ( not seen in the darkness )  --  Kitty , are you there ? KITTY ( to BOB ) Well  --  we 're both having a busy evening  --  are n't we ? It 's Wally . Hello , lovely night , is n't it ? ( Looking over the railing . ) GRAINGER I want to say the poem to you . KITTY I 'm dying to hear it  --  but you ca n't now . Somebody else is here . p. 114 GRAINGER Oh . KITTY Sorry . Ring me up at three o'clock tomorrow  --  sharp . GRAINGER At three sharp . KITTY Perhaps I 'll have dinner with you tomorrow night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Good night . KITTY ( after a slight pause ) Well  --  I do n't expect anybody else  --  but perhaps you do  --  Mr. Brown . Good night . ( She goes in as the CURTAIN FALLS @x Time : 9 o'clock the following morning . Place : The same as Act I. At Curtain : DIERDRE comes out quickly from the hall  --  dressed for going away . KEEN ( coming after her ) If you 're going in I 'm going with you . LESSING No you 're not . I may not go to town . I 'm just waiting to hop in the car and drive till I get ready to stop . KEEN But you  --  LESSING Do n't , Bruce  --  please . I want to be alone for awhile . KEEN Then let me take you some place and you can stay if you want to . LESSING No ! I 'm getting away from everybody . KEEN ( after a pause ) You need n't be so cut up as all that  --  about last night . LESSING Because I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not . I do n't give a damn about that . KEEN Then what is it ? LESSING Oh , let me alone , boy  --  my nerves are jumpy. p. 116 KEEN Sorry . LESSING I mean  --  I want to get off by myself and think  --  before I do talk to you . I 'm fed up with these people . KEEN But they 're all leaving this morning  --  every one of ' em  --  and we 'd be alone . LESSING I want to get away from you ! Ca n't you get that ? KEEN ( after a pause ) Are you going to meet Bob some place ? LESSING None of your business . KEEN You have made a fool of yourself . For God 's sake let him alone  --  Dierdre . He 's through . LESSING ( with sudden anger and abandon ) And why is he ? Because Gran crashed in . Because she got that Kitty woman to come here and vamp him . KEEN Oh bosh ! LESSING ( going to sit on the sofa at Left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete with her . KEEN He cooled off himself . LESSING He didn't. p. 117 KEEN Why she never even looked at him . LESSING Not so anybody could see it . It was all on the side  --  on the sly . KEEN How do you know ? LESSING Because I do . KEEN That 's a pretty low down thing to say about her . LESSING I found them  --  last night  --  on his balcony  --  chummy enough . They 've been right there together all the time . KEEN You found them ? How ? LESSING I went to Bob 's room  --  to talk to him . KEEN You did n't . You did n't do a damn fool thing like that . LESSING I put it up to her  --  and she acknowledged it . KEEN For Heaven 's sake why did you go into his room ? LESSING Because I wanted to . KEEN Then thank God she was there . Thank God you know now about Brown . Oh , Dierdre  --  how could you ? LESSING If he came down here right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd go . p. 118 KEEN You would n't . LESSING I would . KEEN You 're not in love with him . It 's just a  --  an  --  infatuation . LESSING Whatever it is I 've got it . KEEN ( touching DIERDRE 'S shoulder and sitting on the seat at Left of the sofa ) You 'll get over it . I 've been that way  --  lots of times . LESSING Of course you have . But I have n't . It means something to me . KEEN Not a thing . Not a damn thing . If you threw yourself away on that man you 'd want to kill yourself afterwards . LESSING Applesauce ! KEEN ( leaning towards her over the back of the sofa ) Dierdre  --  dearest  --  I want to see you through this . Believe me there 's nothing in it but what you 'll be terribly sorry for  --  and ashamed of afterwards . LESSING Awfully wise  --  are n't you ? KEEN You bet I 'm wise . I want to marry you . I love you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and we could , too  --  if you 'd  --  p. 119 LESSING Yes  --  why do you want to marry me ? Why do you love me ? ( Breaking a little . ) I think it 's perfectly marvellous that you do , Bruce  --  but why ?  --  It 's because you 've lived enough to be sure . Well , I have n't . KEEN You do n't have to go through that . LESSING ( softening and putting a hand over his ) Listen , Bruce  --  I like you better than anybody in the world . Maybe we are the best bet for each other . But I 'm not crazy about you the way I am about Bob . KEEN Take it from me  --  liking is a better bet than craziness . LESSING ( drawing her hand away ) Now , do n't talk to me like Santa Claus . I want to know what I 'm doing because I know  --  myself . Not because somebody 's telling me what I ought to do . KEEN If you 'd use your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . LESSING I am using my bean . That 's just it . I 'm not swallowing any old stuff . KEEN Now get this . There 's no new slant on this old stuff at all . Either a girl 's decent or she is n't . There 's no half way business about it  --  and when a fellow gets down to brass tacks , he wants the girl he 's going to marry  --  the one who is going to be the mother of his kids  --  to be the straightest , finest , cleanest thing in the world . p. 120 LESSING Pearls you learned at mother 's knee . And if a girl wants the darling boy she marries to be the same thing  --  where the hell is she going to find him ? KEEN It 's not the same thing at all for you and me . LESSING It is ! KEEN It is n't ! LESSING It is  --  exactly the same thing . Why should I marry you and settle down and pretend that 's all there is to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because you ca n't do anything that  --  LESSING Why should n't I have Bon for a while and marry you , too ? KEEN ( rising and walking away ) Because you ca n't . You simply ca n't . That 's all there is to it . LESSING Do you mean to tell me if I 'd had an affair with Bob  --  and it helped me to know I wanted to marry you  --  you would n't marry me ? KEEN Oh , Dierdre , I love you . I want to help you . There is n't anything I would n't do for you . Ca n't you see you 're  --  ( MRS . BOUCICAULT enters from the terrace  --  followed by PERKINS  --  who carries the morning mail in a small basket ) p. 121 MRS . BOUCICAULT What are you two doing down here at this ungodly hour ? How I loathe Monday mornings  --  coming down to speed the parting guest . I do n't know why I do it . I do n't know why I do n't just let ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense pleasure to actually see them go . What 's up ? Where are you going , Dierdre ? LESSING ( rising and going towards the terrace ) Away for a few days  --  by myself . MRS . BOUCICAULT ( sitting on the sofa at Left ) Get along , Perkins . ( PERKINS puts the basket of letters on table above sofa and goes out through the hall . ) That 's a good idea . Go off and come to your senses  --  and then  --  LESSING ( turning back to MRS . BOUCICAULT ) It was a rotten low down thing for you to do , Gran . MRS . BOUCICAULT What are you saying ? LESSING You were terribly clever , were n't you ? It worked all right . I found them last night . I went to Bob 's room to talk to him  --  and there they were . It 's lousy  --  that 's what it is  --  filthy . MRS . BOUCICAULT What are you  --  p. 122 LESSING The sneakiness of it ! KEEN ( who has gone to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others ) Be careful , Dierdre ! Do n't talk so loud . MRS . BOUCICAULT You went to Bob 's room last night ? You did n't . If you did you did n't know what you were doing . I wo n't have it . LESSING Wo n't you ? How about the other lady  --  what she 's done ? That 's all right , I s'pose . You can swallow what 's going on in your house  --  so long as you get what you want . KEEN Shut up  --  Dierdre ! MRS . BOUCICAULT How dare you say such a thing to me ! LESSING Oh , how dare  --  bunk , Gran ! You sent for her , did n't you  --  to do just that ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Just what ? Just what ? Kitty 's not that kind of a woman . LESSING You put them off there in that wing  --  alone  --  together  --  so this would happen  --  did n't you ? MRS . BOUCICAULT No  --  no  --  no ! I do n't know what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eyes  --  has n't it ? Are n't you through with Bob Brown now ? Are n't you ready to behave yourself and marry Bruce ? p. 123 LESSING Do you think that has anything to do with me  --  and the way I feel toward Bob ? Just because you cooked up a nasty thing with that kind of a woman  --  ( DIERDRE stops suddenly as KITTY comes out from the hall . KITTY is wearing a summer gown appropriate for going to town  --  but without hat or coat . ) KITTY ( coming further into the room ) I suppose I 'm the woman . MRS . BOUCICAULT I know this is all ridiculous nonsense , Kitty . I do n't believe a word of it . KITTY Why do n't you ? You wanted it to happen  --  did n't you ? That 's why you offered me your hospitality  --  is n't it ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Bruce  --  go away . KEEN Why should I ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Because I tell you to . KITTY Is this going to be too bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole business . KEEN I think I have a right to know anything that concerns Dierdre . MRS . BOUCICAULT No you have n't . Go away , I tell you . p. 124 KEEN Do you want me to , Dierdre ? LESSING Yes . ( BRUCE hesitates and goes out across the terrace and to the Left . ) MRS . BOUCICAULT Kitty  --  tell Dierdre that what she thinks  --  is n't true . KITTY She must tell me what she does think  --  before I can do that . LESSING ( fighting back her angry tears ) You took him away from me  --  did n't you ? KITTY I ca n't say I tried to . LESSING You did n't even have to try  --  I s'pose  --  with your methods . MRS . BOUCICAULT Dierdre  --  KITTY And what are my methods supposed to be ? Oh , let 's be quite frank  --  please . Just exactly what is it you think I 've done ? LESSING Something too rotten to say . MRS . BOUCICAULT The child is insane with jealousy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  is  --  is impossible . KITTY Did you think it would be so impossible , Bouci ? Would you have cared so much how I arrived at what you wanted  --  just so I did arrive ? p. 125 MRS . BOUCICAULT I 'm shocked beyond words , Kitty , that you could think that I could want  --  LESSING ( going back of the large chair at Right ) Do n't take me for a blithering idiot , Gran . I know . KITTY ( with sudden anger  --  moving a little towards DIERDRE ) And what do you know ? There was just a minute last night when I wanted you to believe I 'd done that rotten thing  --  because I thought it would save you a bigger heartache  --  later on . More or less the same thing happened to me  --  once  --  and I was sorry for you  --  with all my heart . I intended to hold my tongue  --  and go through with it . But since you 've talked  --  in not quite a good sportsman way  --  we 'll talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  balcony  --  and found me there first . Surely you can allow me the same comfortable freedom  --  without question  --  which I grant you . Besides  --  I was n't alone with him  --  remember . Mr. Townley was there too . LESSING You do n't think I 'm sap enough to believe that  --  do you ? KITTY Here 's Townie himself . Ask him . ( As TOWNLEY comes out of the house  --  ready to leave. ) p. 126 LESSING Were you there ? TOWN Are you speaking to me ? KITTY ( laughing at TOWNLEY 'S confusion ) She means were you on my balcony last night  --  or were you not ? TOWN ( trying to keep his equilibrium ) Well  --  a  --  a  --  was I ? MRS . BOUCICAULT What are you splashing round about  --  for  --  Townley ? Ca n't you say a little something ? KITTY I hope you do n't mind being compromised a bit for my sake , Townie . LESSING ( as WALLACE comes out from the house  --  dressed for going in town ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll tell us he was there too . KITTY ( laughing at WALLACE ) Almost  --  not quite . GRAINGER I beg pardon ? KITTY We 're discussing the balcony scene . LESSING We all seem to have been there  --  some time  --  during the night . I suppose you were among the number . ( WALLACE looks astounded , tries to speak and flounders . TOWNLEY laughs. ) p. 127 MRS . BOUCICAULT What are you laughing at , Townley ? TOWN I 'm not quite sure . KITTY Do n't you think it 's funny , Wallie ? GRAINGER A  --  I do n't seem to know what it 's all about . MRS . BOUCICAULT No  --  I dare say . KITTY What 's the matter with you , Bouci ? You have a very peculiar tone in your voice . Do n't tell me you are n't pleased with me . MRS . BOUCICAULT I 'm not sure what I 've got to be pleased about . I 'd like to enjoy the joke if there is one . Just where do these two come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up . MRS . BOUCICAULT Up what ? KITTY My steps . You do n't mind a man or two sitting on my steps , do you ? Why did you put me there  --  if you do ? MRS . BOUCICAULT Are you pulling my leg ? KITTY God forbid ! It was this way  --  Bouci . After Townley and Mr. Brown  --  and  --  Dierdre  --  and I had all  --  happened upon my balcony  --  and chatted a little  --  all more or less on the same subject  --  I was about to say good night  --  when I heard a soft whistle and there was Wallie at the foot of the steps  --  in the moonlight  --  asking if he could n't come up and recite his poem to me . ( KITTY and TOWNLEY laugh. ) p. 128 GRAINGER Well  --  I was  --  just passing by and  --  I  --  MRS . BOUCICAULT Yes  --  there must be a little something in it , Wallace . You look like a sick cat . BOB ( coming out from the house  --  also dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joke ? KITTY ( hardening quickly ) The joke 's on me  --  Mr. Brown . BOB Yes ? Why ? KITTY It seems to have been necessary to check up the incidents of last night . LESSING But she 's left you out . How about the you and Kitty incident ? BOB We  --  KITTY No  --  LESSING Go on . She 's so keen about telling everything  --  Go through with it . MRS . BOUCICAULT Dierdre  --  BOB I wo n't let them think  --  KITTY I do n't care what they think . I have your word . p. 129 BOB I do n't care a hang about my word . KITTY I wo n't have my personal affairs aired like this . MRS . BOUCICAULT She 's quite right . I do n't like it either . LESSING No , but you 've let her make a fool of me . You 've let her make a joke of the whole rotten thing . KITTY And what are you trying to make out of it ? I know I asked you to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . That 's where the joke comes in . I 'm afraid I 've tried to be a little too clever , Bouci . I 'm afraid I 've got myself in too deep . There does n't seem to be anything about me to tell  --  what I am  --  ( her voice breaks ) or how things are . That 's rather a joke too . I know exactly what each and every one of you is thinking about me  --  each in his own way . ( To DIERDRE . ) If you think I took your Mr. Brown away from you last night  --  allow me to give him back to you this morning . LESSING I do n't believe you . MRS . BOUCICAULT Dierdre ! BOB ( stopping KITTY as she starts to go ) Dierdre  --  listen  --  Kitty is my wife  --  or was . ( There is a murmur of amazement from them all . ) She divorced me three years ago . But she still is my wife  --  to me . There never has been and there never will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could happen to me would be for her to take me back  --  but that  --  I know  --  is a lost hope . p. 130 KITTY You always have had good manners , Bob . He 's only being magnificent , Bouci . This accidental meeting does n't change anything for us . That was settled three years ago . Do n't let it change anything for anybody else . ( She goes out through the hall . ) BOB ( after a pause ) Dierdre  --  I 'm sorry I  --  LESSING ( in a low tone ) Do n't  --  please . ( She goes out across the terrace and off at Right . ) MRS . BOUCICAULT ( rising , after a pause and going up Center ) Well  --  I ca n't think of anything worth saying at the moment , except that you may miss your train , gentlemen . ( WHITMAN enters from the terrace . ) Here 's Whitman to remind you of that . He 's even better than I am at shuffling people off . WHITMAN The motor is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming . ( WHITMAN goes out . ) BOB Well  --  good-by , Bouci . MRS . BOUCICAULT You 're not going . p. 131 BOB But I must  --  MRS . BOUCICAULT You 've got to wait . I want to talk to you . You ca n't throw a bomb like this and walk right off . I 've got some curiosity  --  you know . Good-by , Townley . ( BOB goes onto the terrace at Left . ) TOWN ( shaking hands ) Thanks so much , Bouci  --  It was  --  MRS . BOUCICAULT I know  --  I know . Put it all in your letter . ( She waves TOWNLEY aside and puts out her hand to WALLACE  --  going onto the terrace . ) Come along , Wallace . TOWN ( going to KITTY as she comes back from the hall , wearing her hat and carrying her coat and gloves ) It 's been marvellous to know you . At least I have n't missed that . KITTY Why so final ? What about that dinner tonight ? TOWN ( in low tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh  --  is there any hope ? KITTY Hope ? Why not conviction ? Everything 's just the same as it was when I saw you last . Is n't it ? p. 132 TOWN Will you come ? KITTY You 're going to phone me at three . TOWN Oh  --  am I ? KITTY Do n't you want to ? TOWN More than anything on earth . KITTY Then for goodness sake do it . Bye-bye till three . TOWN Until three . ( TOWNLEY goes out on the terrace . ) MRS . BOUCICAULT ( to WALLACE , who has been talking to her on the terrace ) Madge is going to stay all week . Run up again if you can . GRAINGER Thanks , I 'd love to . MRS . BOUCICAULT Bob  --  you 've got a car of your own here  --  have n't you ? BOB Yes  --  why ? MRS . BOUCICAULT I 'll tell you later . GRAINGER ( coming down to KITTY who has crossed to look at her hat in the mirror which is on the piano ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know just what . p. 133 KITTY I have n't done anything . Things just happen to us . Heaven knows this is the last thing on the calendar I would have brought about . GRAINGER Something has happened to me  --  too . KITTY What ? GRAINGER You . Am I never going to see you again ? KITTY Why so doubtful ? GRAINGER Because I want it so much . KITTY At three . ( He kisses her hand . ) LIVINGSTON ( coming out of the house in a delectable morning outfit in time to see the kiss ) Good morning  --  everybody . ( WALLACE drops KITTY 'S hand and moves away . ) KITTY ( going to sit on the sofa ) Good morning . LIVINGSTON ( going to WALLACE ) You 'll have to come back this evening . GRAINGER Eh ? LIVINGSTON I have a headache . You 'll have to bring my powders to me. p. 134 GRAINGER Oh , I 'm so sorry . ( He lets MADGE pass him , then holds up three fingers to KITTY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WALLACE goes out after MADGE . ) MRS . BOUCICAULT ( coming down into the room ) You 're a devil , Kitty . You might have let that poor thing alone . BOB ( following MRS . BOUCICAULT ) I have my car here . I 'll drive you in . MRS . BOUCICAULT That 's my idea . KITTY Not mine . MRS . BOUCICAULT Well , I 'd rather hear what you two people have to say to each other now  --  than anything going . But I 'll clear out . Do n't be a mule , Kitty . My advice is  --  take him again . If you do n't  --  you 'll be sorry all your life . If you do  --  you 'll be still more sorry  --  so you have my blessing either way . ( She goes out through the hall . ) KITTY Well  --  good-by , Bob . I 'm sorry I messed up your week end . I seem to be always spoiling your love affairs . ( She goes to him  --  with her hand out. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have n't slept a wink . Those men  --  last night . You 've got to tell me the truth in plain English . KITTY Are you going to begin that again ? ( She goes to adjust her hat at the mirror which is on the piano . ) BOB You ca n't keep the children , Kitty . KITTY ( turning to BOB with sudden fear ) You gave them up . You ca n't take them away from me . BOB I gave them up because you had the things that made it right for them to be with you . KITTY ( going towards BOB ) The things that bored you stiff . BOB The things that are right . Why have you changed like this ? KITTY Why have I changed ? Oh , God  --  you do n't know yet  --  you do n't know now what you did to me  --  what you took away from me . BOB And you took just as much away from me . KITTY Well , then this is what we 've done to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done to each other  --  over something that did n't amount to a hill of beans . Surely you know that now , Kitty . KITTY It was n't even a hill of beans to you  --  but it took away everything from me  --  everything . See here , Bob  --  why are we digging this up ? It 's the last thing on earth I wanted to do . I 've spent three years trying to forget it . Let 's stop and say good-by as sensibly as possible . BOB It 's not so easy for me as it evidently is for you . Three years have n't made me forget . I 've been foot-loose and home sick and done for . If you 'd forgiven me that one time we 'd still be together . KITTY And I 'd still be forgiving you . BOB I 'm not so sure of that . KITTY Do you pretend for a minute that that one crash would have pulled you up forever  --  changed you entirely for the rest of your life ? BOB I could change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right ) It looks like it . If I had n't accidentally happened to be here  --  how far would it have gone with Dierdre ? BOB Just exactly as far as she wanted it to . I told you last night I 've amused myself with anything and everything that came my way  --  since I lost you . How about this Townley ? How far would that have gone if I had n't been there ? p. 137 KITTY Do n't you suppose I knew you were there ? Do n't you suppose I hoped you would find me with him ? Do n't you suppose seeing you carrying on with a girl again brought it all back so I could n't stand it  --  so I wanted to hurt you as hard as I possibly  --  ( Her voice breaks . ) BOB ( drawing a chair close to her and sitting ) Oh  --  that was it . Then there 's nothing in it . There have n't been other men  --  since you left me ? KITTY ( after a pause  --  in a low firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you expect ? BOB I do n't believe it . KITTY ( rising and going behind the chair ) Then why did you ask me ? BOB How could you ! How could you ! KITTY ( with sudden full abandon ) Because I loved you so . BOB What ? KITTY ( moving up and to Center  --  letting her feeling carry her away at last ) Heaven and earth and God were all mixed up in you . When that was gone nothing was left . Ca n't you understand that ? I suppose you think I ought to have stayed at home with a broken heart , for the rest of my life  --  hugging my ideals . But I did n't seem to be able to do that . I had to get out and find out what it was all about  --  to see why you did it . p. 138 BOB Well , then if you 've found out so much  --  if you 've got so wise and experienced  --  you know now how little that affair meant to me . KITTY Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to find out whether I 'd been a fool or not  --  whether I had exaggerated what you did . Well , I had n't . It was just as horrible as I thought it was . Bob , marriage means just one thing  --  complete and absolute fidelity or it 's the biggest farce on earth . BOB I could make our marriage now what you thought it ought to be then . KITTY ( sitting on the sofa at Left ) That I should live to hear you say that , Mr. Brown ! BOB ( standing in front of her ) How can you be so hard ? KITTY Because I refuse to be made unhappy again . BOB ( sitting above her on the sofa ) Kitty , darling  --  if you 'd let me begin again ! God  --  what we 've lost ! Two people who loved each other as we did ! KITTY Do n't harp on that . BOB We had the great chance and muffed it . p. 139 KITTY The chance is gone now , Bob . Let 's be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did go back  --  what of it ? What is there in it ? BOB Well , not so much if we 're only thinking of ourselves . The thing that 's been hitting me in the eye in the last three days is that there is something a damned sight bigger in it than ourselves  --  and that 's what we ought to grab now  --  and hang on to . KITTY The real thing , yes . But as it is  --  as we 've all made it . BOB Well , it is the real thing  --  to plenty of people . KITTY To whom , for instance ? Anybody you know ? BOB Yes , of course . KITTY Who are they ? BOB Well  --  a  --  a  --  KITTY Exactly . Now let 's get over this and not be sorry it happened . And the next time we see each other we 'll be more game about it . BOB All right . Then we 're going to be friends . Have dinner with me tonight in town . KITTY I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll make it any time you say . KITTY Why not all dine together ? BOB Cut out Townley . KITTY But not Wallie . You do n't mind Wallie . He 's having the time of his life . ( They laugh together . BOB bends over her and kisses her hair . ) BOB Give me a chance to make you love me again . That 's fair , is n't it ? KITTY Love is n't enough , Bob . BOB The children . KITTY We had the children . We had love  --  but that did n't keep us together . No , Bob , I 'm not going to give you a chance to hurt me again . It 's the awfullest hurt in the world and it would still be there , if I 'd let it . ( She rises and moves away from him . ) BOB ( following her a little ) But I would n't hurt you again . KITTY No , Bob  --  I 'm not going back . I 'm going on . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake let 's be gay about it . BOB To see you like this is a worse tragedy than losing you . Are n't you sick of this damned batting around  --  trying to fool yourself into thinking you 're having a good time ? p. 141 KITTY Maybe you 've had enough  --  you 've been at it longer than I have  --  maybe you 're ready for your slippers at the fire  --  I 'm not . ( Putting on her coat . ) BOB Oh , Kitty , marry me again . KITTY You 're out of your senses . BOB It 's what I want . It 's the only thing I do want  --  you and the children . Ca n't we make a fresh start ? KITTY It 's too late . BOB Do you hate me ? KITTY ( putting on her gloves ) No . BOB Then why  --  KITTY Oh , it is n't you . BOB What is it then ? KITTY It 's myself . I could n't . Neither could you , Bob . You 're just making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw you , something pounded in me so hard  --  an idiotic hope  --  a something bigger than I ever had  --  or ever knew there could be . This is tougher than the first time I lost you . Good-by , Kitty . ( Putting out his hand. ) p. 142 KITTY ( taking his hand after an instant 's hesitation ) Good-by  --  and good luck . You 'll get over this , Bob , in no time at all . BOB Oh  --  KITTY Yes , you will . I know . It does n't take long . BOB Well , how is it going to end ? What will you do ? Where are you going ? KITTY I do n't know , I 'm sure . Life 's a very complicated business , is n't it ? BOB Do you think I could make you love me again ? That 's the point . KITTY That 's what I 'm afraid of . That 's why I 'm running now . BOB ( going to her ) Kitty  --  KITTY If I let myself go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . BOB You 're adorable ! KITTY ( holding him off ) No , Bob , let 's not make fools of ourselves . It would be no joke for either one of us to try to settle down again . BOB But we  --  KITTY No , I 'm afraid , Bob . I 'm honestly afraid . ( Sitting in the large chair at Right. ) p. 143 BOB Why ? Why , dearest ? KITTY I do n't know . I 've been so gay  --  so  --  so full of  --  so empty . BOB ( dropping on his knees in front of her ) Kitty ! KITTY So lonely  --  BOB Darling ! KITTY Oh , Bob , I love you so . ( Putting her arms about his neck . ) Take me back .
