A majority of the newspapers twitted it . Said the New York World : " The rival coaches assert the brains of their champions are in the pink of condition . " <P> A majority of the professors of English Literature , fearful lest their pupils disgrace themselves , deplored it . Said one Yale professor : " I have troubles enough without letting the public gape at the results of my lectures . " Said another Harvard professor : " It may not do any harm , but I do not approve of it . " <P> Yet it was run off on schedule-the brain battle between undergraduates of Harvard and Yale Universities . For three hours , one afternoon last week , a picked team of ten Yale seniors wrote answers to the regular examination paper which was given to all Harvard seniors specializing in English . They were not allowed to help each other , but the smoking of cigarets was permitted . They sat in old Connecticut Hall , where Patriot Nathan Hale once roomed . On the Yale team were eight Phi Beta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , campus wit , who last autumn wrote on his page in the Yale Alumni Weekly : " Harvard men can not be said to aim at , for they essentially are , good form . " <P> At the same time , in Cambridge , Mass. , the team of ten Harvard seniors answered the same examination paper ( in next year 's tilt a Yale paper will be given to both teams ) . The Harvard men did their writing in a classroom along with 140 other students . The same rules applied , except that the Harvard team was not allowed to smoke . Seven members held scholarships ; one , Richard T. Sherman of Algona , Iowa , had been editorial chairman of the Harvard Crimson ; another , Henry T. Dolan , suffering a fractured kneecap , took his examination in a hospital . <P> The examination was thoroughly academic , covering English literature from the earliest Anglo-Saxon poetry down to Thomas Hardy , with only a few questions on William Shakespeare or the late 19th century writers . One question was to " show by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of the following passages in what ways they are characteristic of their authors or of the times in which they were written . " The passages were taken from William Langland , Edmund Spenser , Samuel Johnson , Charles Lamb , Lord Byron . <P> The papers of both teams were turned over to two Princeton professors and one Cornell professor for marking . The determination of the winning team was awaited eagerly , but not boisterously , at Cambridge and New Haven . <P> This , the first annual brain joust between Harvard and Yale tens , was the result of a $125,000 gift of Mrs. William Lowell Putnam , sister of President Abbott Lawrence Lowell of Harvard . The gift provides a prize of $5,000 worth of books each year to the winning team . <P> If Harvard should win , Yale has an obvious alibi . Harvard employs seven Full Professors to teach English to undergraduates ; Yale has only five .
