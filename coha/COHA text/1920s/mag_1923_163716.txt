Seven hundred masked Ku Klux Klansmen paraded at Tuskegee , Alabama , to protest the installation of Negro physicians at a Negro war veterans ' hospital there . <P> The Negro hospital was recently established in connection with Tuskegee Institute , of which the late <P> Booker T. Washington was head . The Klansmen who made the demonstration apparently did nothing more than march in silence through the town and past the Institute . Immediately the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People sent a telegram to President Harding asking that troops be sent to protect the lives of the colored doctors and of Dr. Robert R. Moton , present head of the Institute . <P> It appears , however , that only one member of the Negro staff , the installation of which had been ordered by Director Frank E. Hines , had appeared at Tuskegee when the Klansmen made their demonstration . He was not a doctor but an auditor , and quickly departed when sentiment in the town demanded he do so . Actually there were 15 Negro patients and a white staff present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was declared at the Institute that no " direct threats " had been made on Booker Washington 's successor . Reports declared , moreover , that he was not in favor of the installation of complete Negro staff and that sentiment in Tuskegee was friendly to him . <P> General Hines , who had issued the offending order , appeared oppportunely on the spot and conferred with the townspeople . A committee of three was appointed to confer with Director Hines , who declared his unwillingness " to be a partner to anything that might be detrimental to the Tuskegee community . " Before the hospital was established it seems that the citizens of Tuskegee were given to understand that a white staff would be in charge . Director Hines declared that the Government might be under a moral obligation to provide white doctors , even if Negro orderlies and nurses were employed . <P> It became quickly apparent the difficulties were in a fair way to composition , and that the life of Dr. Moton is not in danger .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
