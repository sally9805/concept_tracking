txt With the arrival of Charles F. Murphy late this afternoon the final and decisive stages of the preliminaries of the Democratic State Convention have been reached with the followers or former Governor Alfred E. Smith , William R. Hearst and other candidates for the two principal places on the State tici : -t , not to mention a host of contenders for minor nominations lined up for the battle . Murphy may not be the convention , but it is very evident that the convention will not make up its mind on whom to fix unless tae prospective nominee has first received the approval of the Tammany chieftain . The supporters of " AI " Smith and William R. Hearst , the two principal figures in the contest for the nomination for Governor and in the entire galaxy of candidates for offices , big and small , are just as positive as ever in voicing their prophecies of victory . Murphy is listening to what both sides have to say but is saying nothing himself . Former Governor Smith . prepared to go through with his program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; oor of the convention should this prove recessara- to bring about his elimination , has been here since early this morning . For hours this forenoon he was about the lobby of the Hotel Onondaga , where he has established headquarters , lionized by leaders from up-State counties who have hitched their wagons to his political star . The former Governor , while smiling and confident and to all appearances in a most happy frame cf rind , declined to answer any questions egarding his anti-Hearst campaign in the convention . Kelly to Lead Smith vorces. - William H. Kelley , leader of Onondaga County , and , aside from Winfield A. Iluppuch , former State Chairman and leader of his party ' in Washington County , perhaps the most outspoken of the Smith supporters north of the Bronx , will be in charge of them in the convention . Kelley met Murphy at toe station on his arrival and soon afterward took a walk with the Tammany chieftain . Tonight they dined in the seclusion of Murphy 's suite , and after dinner Kelley was one of the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Norman E. Mack , another warm supporter of Smith , and a small group of leaders from up-State counties . William J. Conners , principal promoter of the Hearst campaign , arrived this evening , having ' been preceded by his principal lieutenant , former Democratic State Chairman Edwin S. Harris , end William A. De Ford , Hearst 's principal attorney . De Ford said he had come to Syracuse as an " observer " and that it was most unlikely that his chief would attend the convention in person . The supporters of Hearst tonight are wearing grave faces , even though it is admitted that with Mayor Hylan as his ally he is in a better position to make his influence felt at the convention than at any time in the past when he has sought political preferment from the party he has so frequently and so bitterly reviled and at times repudiated . Conners was no exception . The perennial smile was missing from his countenance when he hurried into the lobby of the Onondaga this evening . " Who is going to be - nominated ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he admitted . " The time has now come when l must show him our strength and the reasons why Hearst should be nominated if the party wants to win . 1 am ready for the showdown and hope to be able to make it good and strong and convince Murphy . " Murphy for Unit Rule . There have been three developments today , none decisive , but which may indicate what way the political wind is blowing . First , announcement was made soon after Murphy 's arrival that Senator James J. Walker , leader of the Democratic minority in the upper house , had been picked for temporary chairman of the convention , in which capacity he would deliver the keynote speech . Senator Walker is a warm friend of former Governor Smith . Second , Murphy , at conferences tonight , made it known that if his influence could prevent it , the unit rule would not be applied to the delegations from Manhattan and the Bronx , but that every delegate would be left free to vote according to his best judgment of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was regarded as an indication that the same rule would have to be applied to other delegations  --  those from Kings and Queens . for example , which the promoters of the Hearst boom have claimed.in their entirety , trusting to the influence Mayor Hylan can wield through his position as a dispenser of city patronage . Third . former Governor Smith , after conferring with his friends and sup- porters , made it ? mown that he had come to Syracuse as a candidate for the gubernatorial nomination and that he did not desire to be considered for the nomination for United States Sena tor if by home chance he should be eliminated as a candidate for the head of the ticket . This , in the estimation of up-State leaders who favor his nomination , will greatly strengthen him as a contender against Hearst and spike the plans of Conners to divide the Smith forces , into groups supporting him variously for the nomination for Governor and Senator . Fourth , the Democratic women , after conferences here , have determined to n-iake a drive for one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women prominently mentioned as candidates all have refused to run if It is headed by Hearst . All four of these developments are looked on as militating against Hearst . The most important perhaps is the definite stand taken ' by Murphy against the unit rule . The decision or the women was also regarded as more or less of a blow at Hearst and intended to be such , rather than to indicate aspirations for office .. It is not considered unlikely that Murphy and the other leaders may decide that with no woman on the Republican ticket , and the hostility Governor Miller has aroused among members of the League of Women Voters , the time is opportune for the party to make a special bid for women 's votes . Two years ago Miss Harriet May Mills , now head of the women 's division of the State Committee , was nominated for Secretary of State , and that is one of the places now being sought for a woman . Kelley said tonight that he could see ao reason for revising his recent assertion that out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 292 had either been instructed for Smith or elected with a definite understanding that they should support him from the first ballot and until a nomination had been made . With this number from upState the former Governor would require only 76 additional votes from New York City to fill out hiss majority . ? ' Suppose Smith should be eliminated , who would get the nomination ? " Kelley was askd . " I do n't know , " he replied . In his - fight to put Smithover , - . Kelley has a , powerful ally in Miss Harriet May Mills , Chairman of the Women 's Division ' of the State Committee . Miss Mills Again Candidate . Miss Mills said tonight that there would be not fewer than 110 women delegates in the convention , supplying approximately one-seventh of the voting strength . She added that a large majority of the women delegates would support former Governor Smith . " I have not met one woman delegate who is for Mr. Hearst for , the nomination , " said Miss Mills . " There are some delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the women who will go to the convention from up-State counties are almost to a woman for Al Smith . " Miss Mills is again being put forward as candidate for the nomination for Secretary of State , although she is not herself an active contender for the place . Other women mentioned for this or any other place which might go to a woman are Mrs. Daniel O'Day a Westchester . Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt and Miss Marion Dickerman . Miss - Nancy Cook , Secretary of the Women 's Division of the State Committee , was asked if any of the women were willing to become candidates if Hearst ? was nominated . " Certainly not . " was her reply . Lunn May 130 Senate Candidate . Among the arrivals today were Frederick E. Wallis , Chairman of the . Finance Committee of the State Committee , who is said to be candidate for some nomination , but with small chance that his hopes will ' be realized , and Mayor Lunn of Schenectady , who is said to be in line for the nomination for Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to be not entirely out of the question as a compromise candidate for Governor if both Smith ? and ' Hearst are . eliminated . Charles E. Norris of Carthage , an active candidate for the nomination for Attorney General , is also here . Murphy was accompanied by Thomas F. Smith , Secretary of Tammany Hall , and Phil Donohue , Water Supply Commissioner . Murphy chatted freely , but regarding prospective nominations would say only that he had not had an opportunity to learn at first hand the sentiment among the delegates . United States Senator Wadsworth , Republican National Committeeman Hilles , Samuel ** Colonel William Fifty. - ward , United States Attorney , and other Republican leaders on their way to the Republican State Convention , occupied seats in the car as far as Albany with Murphy . Murphy chuckled over the demand of Governor Miller for the nomination of men on the Republican ticket with whom he could work in co-operation . " And they say I 'm a ' boss , ' said Murphy , " . and they call Governor Miller a leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
