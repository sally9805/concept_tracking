In the Mojave Desert , Kern County , Calif. , a kernite* mine has been discovered which will revolutionize the borax industry , according to Dr. Waldemar T. Schaller of the U. S. Geological Survey . When washed and recrystallized , kermite is ready for market as pure sodium borate . All previous processes of manufacturing borax have been costly , complicated , unsatisfactory . Italy has condensed volcanic steam containing boric acid to get it ; Chile has refined and purified ulexite at great expense ; the U. S. has mined borax from mineral deposits around Death Valley , a process dangerous and difficult ; or has manufactured it from brine , a method in excellent standing before the discovery of the kernite mine . <P> This increase in production will take borax out of the idle rich class of chemicals and put it to work in many industries which previously could not afford it . Already its value is well known . It has long been a familiar household god in the kitchen , a mild antiseptic ( boric acid ) in the medicine chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in temperature ; is used therefore in making lamp chimneys , incandescent lamps , baking dishes . Enamel ware , plumbing fixtures , chemical apparatus owe much of their resistance to borax . But wherever borax has gone in , the price has gone up . Since the discovery of kernite , borax has fallen steadily in price as shown last week by the Industrial Bulletin ( monthly ) of Arthur D. Little , Inc. ; expectations are that this decrease will continue , not only because of the increased supply but because of the competition between borax from brine and borax from kernite . <P> This competition is being fostered by British finance in spite of the fact that the U. S. is now the greatest store and supply house for borax in the world . The American Potash and Chemical Corporation , present producers of borax from brine , are a subsidiary of the New Consolidated Gold Fields of South Africa in London ; the Pacific Coast Borax Co. , present producers of borax from kernite , are a subsidiary of the Borax Consolidated of London . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unites with water to form sodium borate .
