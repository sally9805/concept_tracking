txt THE INHERITANCE LAW Misunderstandings of the New Act , Which- Has . Great ' Merits . ? To the Editor of The New York Times : . J. R. Lex , in a letter to THE NEW - Form TIMES published by you on April 20 , 1920 , takes exception to certain provisions contained in our new inheritance law , and in so doingmisstates the law in a fashion to indicate his complete misconception of it . The new inheritance law ; as yoiir readers doubtless . know , was drafted by a commission composed of experienced surrogates , legislators and lawyers , with Surrogate Foley as its chairman . In a recent editorial of yours on the subject , published a few days after the bill became law , you accurately stated the main accomplishments of . the measure , namely , the establishment of equality as between husband and wife , abolition of tLe old-fashioned and delusive right. ; of dower and courtesy and the substitution in their stead of more ? substantial benefits . The writer of the letter mention : : only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other changes , admittedly of value , he does not mention . He complains only of that portion of the law which seeks to prevent a husband from unjustly disinheriting his wife and vice versa As a matter of fact , this . is a most important part of the law and one that marks ? a long step ' forward in the establishment of marriage upon a secure economic footing . Furthermore ( and this may come as a surprise to the writer of the letter ) this right of wife or husband to elect to take against the will is not such a radical innovation as might be , supposed . Many other States in. the United States have practically identi cal provisions . Even in New York this notion of protection from disinheritance has always had  --  its place in our law . There have always been limitations upon a man 's ( or woman 's ) power to dispose of his property as he saw fit . The law has for many years prohibited a person . leaving husband , wife ; parent or descendant from willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has also prohibited a husband from willing away his wife 's dower right in the real property owned by him during . marriage . The new law in this respect introduces no new principle . It merely enlarges the scope of the rile and gives to it for the first time genuine force and effectiveness . It says in effect that the right which a wife now has to be supported by her husband during his lifetime shall not terminate at hil death , and that she shall not then be left penniless because . of the fact that he has chosen to leave all his property to another It being the established policy of the law to favor marriage , this is merely a logical extension of that principle . All substantial advances in law meet with opposition , but this Fea ? - on-Jenks bill was fortunate in the support it had train civic bodies , bar associations and women 's organiza. - . Hons . It was endorsed by the committees of the- New York State ? Bar Association , the New York City Bar Association , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Women 's City Club of New York and the New York League of Women Voters . It has brought our State from the rear of the procession well up into the vanguard of States boasting Madam and socially minded statutes . It should be appreciated more and more after it goes into actual operation on Sept. 1 , 1930 , It can ( and will , no doubt ) be improved . I hope to see in it some day a provision protecting children from disinheritance . At the same time , even as it stands today , it registers the greatest advance in the law of estates that has taker . place in our State in a century . DOROTHY KENYON , Chairman of the Committee on the Legal Status of Women , League of Women Voters . New York , April 28 , 1329 . FOREIGN LANGUAGES . We Have Little Need of Ability to Speak or Understand Them . To ; tbe Editor of The New rook Mims : Why should we expect instruction in modern languages to produce any ability to speak the languages or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion to speak them , and fewer still of us any occasion to understand them . For cultural purposes the main usefulness of a modern language is in the ability to read it with ease . For many professional uses , as in scholarly pursuits , medicine , education and engineering , the ability to . read easily and fluently technical works in the other languages is the sole urgent need . For foreign trade the ability to read commercial correspondence and to write correct , idiomatic replies is all that is required . The examination of the College Entrance Examination Board are , however , equally justly open to attack on these bases as on the bases cited in THE TIMES recent editorial and the letter of Carolus T. Clark . These examinations are so strongly directed toward knowledge of grammar and ability to translate into and from the language involved that the important abilities are entirely overlooked . The content of the reading on which the examinations are set is unpardonably far- afield from the type of reading that one does- for cultural , professional or commercial ' purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mr. Clark says are desirable : to " add , multiply , subtract and divide * * discourse intelligently * * * " &c.,; in any language other than our own . But many of us need the ability to read contemporary material , upon - topics of interest , and few ' of us ' get that abil- , ity from instruction in ' the languages . We are subjected- to drill that will enable us to pass the ? board 's " examinatiOns or those of ' the Regents . We know something about the grammar of the language and have stumblingly translated a few literary masterpieces . STEPHEN G. RICH . Vetona , N. J. , , April 3U , 182a.
