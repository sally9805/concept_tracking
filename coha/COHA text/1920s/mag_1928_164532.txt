( see front cover ) One of the two oldtime political parties , between which there is not , yet is , a great difference , was about to nominate a man for the U. S. Presidency . The vortex of the event was in the Midwestern flatlands . The result would work no immediately perceptible change in the day-to-day life of millions and millions of citizens . The result would be a headline in the newspapers , a shout across-lots , a word by radio , to the vague majority . <P> Meantime , keyed to the vortices of Presidential elections are the individuals involved or hopeful of being involved . The experience of each Candidate persuades him that his unique self may be the historic medium of an intensely interested multitude . Or else he is like a steeplejack , undizzied by his altitude in public affairs and intent on mending the weathervane , or crowing as a weathercock . <P> Last week , a thickset , greying , busy-beaverish man sat in his big bare office at the U. S. Department of Commerce in <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listening the rest of the time to a new radio he had had installed to be sure of getting Kansas City clearly . At his home was another receiving set . He had worked all over the world at a man 's work ; given orders , reasoned objectively , sought no praise . Yet there he sat , listening for his friend , John McNab of Palo Alto , to make a speech about him ; then for thunderous cheers , roll-calls of delegates , a flattering result . <P> In Kansas City , in a hotel , with the vortex only a few blocks away , a solid , grey , squire-like man from Illinois also waited for the result . He had been a State Governor and knew the surge of popular acclaim . " No man ever ran away from the presidency , " he had said . He was hoping the farmers from his section of the land would insist upon the nomination coming to him . He thought he could win the trust of all the other kinds of men whose influence counted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends play up the farm idea and prepared to be called from the plow . . . . But he answered curtly the reporters who questioned him . Once , at the Kansas City railroad station , he gave a Hearst newshawk an ungentle shove and said : " You newspaper men will get along better with me if you wait until I have something to say . " <P> Through Kansas City , early in the week , passed a more cheerful figure than either the Beaver Man or the Modern Cincinnatus . This one , swart , short , mustachioed , had played a different game from theirs , a waiting game . Redskin ancestors on his grandmother 's side had doubtless played the same game often . Out hunting with other braves , a good plan had been to let the others stalk , and perhaps frighten , the deer , which then would come along the runway where an artful man sat ready . The Indian-blooded Senator from Kansas had seen the waiting game work well on race tracks , too . Riding as a jockey himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , then whipped his own mount past them at the finish . Good nature and confidence are essentials in playing the waiting game and on his way to Topeka , where his watchful headquarters were to be , Candidate Curtis of Kansas said :
