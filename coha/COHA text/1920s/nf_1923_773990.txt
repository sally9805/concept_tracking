txt Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries would not repeat their signatures . The old warrant was , therefore , brought up to date by means of the erasure of the older date and insertion of the new , and further signatures were obtained on the 29th , bringing the total number up to fifty-nine . Precisely what extent of pressure , or even force , was used to obtain these signatures is not known , but the evidence at the trials of the Regicides is significant . As Mr. Gardiner says : " On the whole it will be safe to assume that great pressure was put , some-times in rough military fashion , on those who hung back . " That the compelling figure behind all this was Cromwell can not be seriously doubted . He " had made up his mind that the King must die , and when his mind was made up he was inflexible , " so says Professor Firth . Despite public opinion , despite the protest on the 29th of the Assembly of Divines , and of the Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appeal of the Prince ? the blank paper signed by himself on which the Parlia ment might inscribe any terms they pleased ? he was determined that the deed must be done 25 40 January 30 , 1649 It is impossible not to admire in all this the gigantic resolution of Cromwell , but even Cromwell could not control time and circumstance absolutely . Whether it was an incomplete scaffold , or the exigencies of a belated Act of Parliament , or the refusal of the execu tioner to wield the axe without a final written order ( which it was said at Colonel Axtell 's trial Cromwell had been forced to write out himself owing to the timidity of one Huncks ) , 26 whether it was some final hesitation of Fairfax , or some profounder and still hidden influence , whatever the reason , the King was kept upon the very brink of fate for three tedious hours . Part of this time he spent in repose , part in prayer with Bishop Juxon , and part in private prayer alone . At twelve o'clock he ate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refusing to dine , as having previously taken the Sacrament . At about half-past one Colonel Hacker came to the bedchamber door to summon the King to the scaffold . Both Herbert and the Bishop fell upon their knees weeping , " and the King gave him his Hand to kiss , and help 'd the Bishop up , for he was aged . " The King " with a chearful look " passed along the gal leries and through the Banqueting Hall lined with 4 1 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries soldiers . Behind the soldiers , who were silent and dejected , crowds of men and women surged forward , regardless of personal safety , praying for the King , " to behold , " as Herbert says , " the saddest sight England ever saw . " Through the middle window of the Banqueting Hall the King stepped out upon the scaffold . Multi tudes of people thronged Whitehall to watch the tremendous spectacle . Immediately round the scaf fold , which was entirely covered with black , were companies of horse and foot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Hacker , and Colonel Tomlinson ; these three and two masked men , the executioner 27 and his assistant , were the most conspicuous occupants of the scaffold . Herbert was unable to endure the horror of the sight , and waited in the Banqueting Hall till the execution was over . He entrusted Bishop Juxon with the white satin night-cap in which the King was to confine his hair before the axe fell . As the King walked on to the scaffold , he looked " very earnestly on the Block , " and asked if there were no higher ; the block , in fact , was only six inches high . This is clear , not only from contemporary records , but from some of the old engravings , notably 42 January 30 , 1649 that in the 1673 edition of the Book of Common Prayer . " The King , however , did not complain , but imme diately addressed his final speech to those with him ; it was impossible for his voice to carry as far as the throngs waiting beyond the soldiers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hold his peace very well " if I did not think that holding my Peace would make some Men think that I did submit to the guilt , as well as to the Punishment . But I think it is my Duty to God first , and to my Country , for to clear myself both as an honest Man , a good King , and a good Christian . " He proceeded to protest his innocency as to the beginning of the Civil War , that he did not begin it , but the Parliament : " they confect that the Militia was mine , but they thought it fit to have it from me . " Still , he did not lay the guilt upon the Parliament , believing that " ill Instruments between them and me have been the chief Cause of all this Bloodshed . " Then in words of deep humility he referred to that act he had always regretted , his reluctant acquiescence in the sentence on Strafford : 43 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries " yet for all this God forbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to say God 's Judgments are just upon me ; many times he does pay Justice by an unjust Sentence : that is ordinary : I only say this , that an unjust Sentence that I suffered to take effect , is punished now by an unjust Sentence upon me . " Next he desired to show that he died a good Christian , having forgiven all his enemies , even those in particular who had been the chief causers of his death . But his charity must go further ; not only did he wish that they should repent , but that they might " take the right way to the peace of the Kingdom , for Charity commands me not only to forgive particular Men , but my Charity commands me to endeavour to the last gasp the peace of the Kingdom . " He proceeded to give his opinion as to how his adversaries had erred " out of the way " ; for their way was the way of conquest , and " Conquest , Sirs , in my opinion is never just , except there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , or just title , " and the slightest step beyond that turned conquest into robbery . The conclusion of the King 's speech I give in full , as being for ever memorable : " Now , Sirs , for to put you in the way ; believe it , you will never do right , nor God will never prosper you , until you give him his due , the King his due ( that is , my Successors ) and the People their due , I am as much for them as any of you : You must give God his due , by regulating rightly his Church ( according 44 January 30 , 1649 to his Scriptures ) which is now out of order ; for to set you in a way particularly , now I can not ; but only this . A National Synod freely called , freely debating among themselves , must settle this , when that every opinion is freely and clearly heard . For the King indeed I will not ( then turning to a gentleman that touched the Ax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ' ) . As for the King , the Laws of the Land will clearly instruct you for that ; therefore because it concerns my own particular , I only give you a touch of it .

It is not for having share in Government ( Sirs ) that is nothing pertaining to them . A Subject and a Sovereign are clean different things ; and therefore until they do that , I mean , That you do put the People in that Liberty as I say , certainly they will never enjoy themselves . Sirs , it was for this that now I am come here .

In troth , Sirs , I shall not hold you much longer ; for I will only say this to you , That in truth I could have desired some little time longer , because that I would have put this that I have said in a little more order , and a little better digested , than I have done ; and therefore I hope you will excuse me . I have delivered my Conscience , I pray God that you take 45 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries those Courses that are best for the good of the King dom , and your own Salvation . " 29 At the end of this wonderful speech , wonderful at any time , but doubly so in the tremendous moments in which it was made , Bishop Juxon prompted the King to say something about his religious beliefs . Whereupon the King , with the same complete self-possession that a Minister might show in an ordinary debate in the I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleague on the Treasury bench , thanked the Bishop for his intervention , and declared that he died " a Christian according to the Profession of the Church of England , as I found it left me by my Father ; and this honest Man ( the Bishop ) I think will witness it . " Thereupon he turned to the Puritan officers , Colonel Hacker and Colonel Tomlinson , and said : " Sirs , excuse me for this same , I have a good cause , and I have a gracious God : I will say no more . " Then to Colonel Hacker : " ' Fake care that they the executioners do not put me to pain . " And jokingly to one who came near the axe : " Take heed of the Axe , pray take heed of the Axe . " He turned to the exe cutioner : " I shall say but very short Prayers , and 46 January 30 , 1649 then thrust out my hands . " From Bishop Juxon he took the silk night-cap , and asked the executioner if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking him to put it all under his cap , he did so with the help of the Bishop and the executioner . These are the final words , as moving as any in a tragedy of Shakespeare , between the King and the Bishop : The King : I have a good Cause , and a gracious God on my side . Dr. Juxon : There is but one Stage more : This Stage is turbulent and troublesom . It is a short one . But you may consider , it will soon carry you a very great way ; it will carry you from Earth to Heaven , and there you shall find to your great joy the Prize ; you haste to a Crown of Glory . The King : I go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown , where no disturbance can be . Dr. Juxon : You are exchanged from a temporal to an eternal Crown , a good Exchange . Taking off his cloak and giving his George ? the ensignia of the Garter ? to the Bishop with the word " Remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the block ; " and after a little pause , stretching forth his hands , the executioner at one blow severed his Head from his Body . " It was precisely at four minutes past two that the blow fell . The effect upon the watching crowds as 47 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries the executioner held up the head with the customary words , " Behold the head of a Traitor , " has been described by one who was himself among them : " The Blow I saw given , and can truly say with a sad heart ; at the instant whereof , I remember wel , there was such a Grone by the Thousands then present , as I never heard before and desire I may never hear again . There was according to Order one Troop immediately marching from-wards charing-cross to Westr and another from-wards Westr to charing cross purposely to masker i.e. distract the people , and to disperse and scatter them , so that I had much adoe amongst the rest to escape home without hurt . " 30 Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffice to say that his body was denied interment in Henry VII 's chapel in Westminster Abbey , for fear of an outburst of public feeling at the funeral ; that after embalmment the body was taken to Windsor " in a Hearse covered with black velvet , drawn by six horses also cover 'd in black , " and being attended by the faithful Herbert , the Duke of Rich mond , Lord Southampton and one or two others , was buried in St. George 's Chapel on February 9 , 1649 . It is typical of the intolerance of the time that Bishop Juxon was not permitted to use the service for the 48 January 30 , 1649 burial of the dead from the Book of Common Prayer . Upon the coffin were these words only : KING CHARLES . 1648 . " This is memorable , " says Herbert , " that at such time as the King 's Body was brought out of St. George 's Hall ; the Sky was serene and clear , but presently it began to snow , and fell so fast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Royal Chappel , the black Velvet-Pall was all white ( the colour of Innocensy ) being thick covered over with snow . So went the white King to his Grave , in the 48th Year of his Age , and the 22nd Year and loth Month of his Reign . Letting pass Merlyn 's Prophecies , some make it allude to the white Sattin his Majesty wore , when he was crowned in Westminster Abbey in the year 162s , former Kings having on purple Robes at their Coronation . " Nearly three centuries have crept by since that cold winter 's day of January 30 , 1649 . But despite " the unimaginable touch of time , " and man 's marvellous capacity of forgetfulness , he can not escape from the past , or flee from the shades of his ancestors . The King and Cromwell survive , not simply as in their statues at Charing Cross and Westminster , with eyes staring vacantly upon the generations of men , but as insistent shades haunting every house Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries in England , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it is just because they are still in reality very near to us , because they repre sent with such sincerity the eternal types of religion and politics , that it is so hard to survey their times with an impartial eye . Certainly for close on a century and a half after its publication in 1702 Clarendon 's majestic History in fluenced opinion decisively in favour of the King . It is significant that the commemoration service on January 30 of each year , " being the day of the mar tyrdom of King Charles the First , " was not removed from the Prayer Book till 1859 .31 Since the middle of the nineteenth century Carlyle 's Letters and Speeches and Macaulay 's History and Essays have , as decisively , influenced opinion in favour of Cromwell . Mr. S. R. Gardiner and Professor Firth , historians whom all students must profoundly venerate ? where do they stand ? The gigantic shade of Cromwell moves im perceptibly nearer as one asks the question . On the point of personal might and genius there is , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the greatest men of the world . The mere fact that in little more than eighteen months after his death the whole system by which he had ruled collapsed , simply shows how immense was his personal power . 50 January 30 , 1649 But the fact of this complete collapse raises in itself the whole question of the justification of that revolution of which he was the animating and directing force . As I have ventured to suggest at the beginning of this essay , the form of the British Constitution , as we now know it , is a compromise between the best ideals underlying the conflict between the King and Cromwell . But for a century and a half following the Restoration both religious and political development was certainly more in accord with the King 's than with Cromwell 's notions of government . Not only during the greater part of this period was the Anglican Church supremely powerful , but it was also representatively popular . It is notorious that the Wesleyans , at the end of the eighteenth century the largest of the Nonconforming bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglican fold only with the utmost reluctance . And it is specially noteworthy that it was during the nineteenth century , when Nonconformity as a whole made its greatest stride in popular opinion , that Cromwell ? with the aid , paradoxically enough , of that arch anti-democrat , Carlyle ? has come to be regarded as the heroic figure of Democracy . On the purely political side , it is almost bewildering to find a King of England , nearly a hundred and fifty years after the Cromwellian axe had severed Charles 's head from his body , exercising his personal power to foil on vital occasions the policy of two of 5 1 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries the greatest and most powerful Ministers this country ever had , the elder and the younger Pitt . So far was Cromwell himself from applying the principles of representative government that he gloried in that ultimate argument of all tyrannies ? necessity . In his speech at the meeting of the second Protectorate Parliament on September 17 , 1656 , in the course of his remarks justifying the odious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I can rather act with comfort and simplicity on necessity than from all instituted things in the world ! " And again : " But if nothing should ever be done but what is according to I.aw , the throat of the Nation may be cut while we send for some to make a Law ! " 32 No government in effect afforded a better illustration than Cromwell 's of the King 's celebrated aphorism from the scaffold : " A Subject and a Sovereign are clean different things . " Cromwell , indeed , quickly discovered , when he came to rule the country , the perpetual problem of all governors and of all govern ments : he complained on September 2 ( O.S. ) , 1653 , in reference to the doings of the Little Parliament , that he was " more troubled now with the fool than before with the knave . " 33 52 January 30 , 1649 The question of the justification of the Crom wellian revolution can not simply be met by the easy answer of the inevitability of historical events . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predestination . And the more research is made into the political-religious struggle of that particular period , the more insistent become the questions : ? Need it all have happened as it did ? Should we not have attained our modern constitutional compromise without the aid of the Cromwellian sword ? ? that is not to say without Cromwell , but is not the true significance of Cromwell ? not the sword , but the spirit ? At the least , was there not far more justification for the Royalist standpoint than has been allowed by most modern historians ? No one can read that brilliant contribution to historical knowledge ' and political theory , The Divine Right of Kings , by the late Dr. J. Neville Figgis , whose premature death will be for ever lamented by those who knew and loved him , without realising that the doctrine of Divine Right , derided only by 53 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries the ignorant , not only had its practical justification in helping to free England from Papal supremacy ? and , indeed , from all forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? but its spiritual justification in inculcating the basic duty of obedience . " Englishmen have cause for gratu lation , that , in a time when the tendency is to loosen the bonds of allegiance and to proclaim ( generally out of season ) the morality of insurrection , there should still exist in the minds of the great majority of their countrymen a deep sense of the majesty of law and of the duty of obedience . This sense is the priceless legacy bequeathed to our own day by the believers in the Divine Right of Kings . " 34 But whatever may be the ultimate verdict of historians ? perhaps generations hence , when the 54 January 30 , 1649 ghostly presence of the King and Cromwell are less insistently present ? as to the justification for the Cromwellian revolution as a whole , there can be no question whatever as to the shock , and consequent reaction , in men 's minds caused by the King 's execu tion on January 30 , 1649 . The evidence on this point is overwhelming ; indeed , the Restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , able to add to the stock of testimony by the following vivid extract from a contemporary diary , the existence of which has hitherto been unknown to students , and which has never been published 35 The diarist is the Reverend Samuel Woodforde , D.D. , F.R.S . ( 1636 ? 1701 ) , who was a Prebendary of Winchester , and wrote A Paraphrase upon the Psalms of David . His testimony is the more weighty as he came of parents with deep Puritan sympathies . The entry was actually made in 1678 , but , as will be seen , the diarist is turning his mind back to the days of his boyhood : " Concerning the late our Gracious Sovereign to this day I remember , that came at night as I was wont from St. Paul 's schole I found the good old Man 36 55 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries all in tears , as who truly thought the Glory was departed from Our Israel ; wond'ring at it , tho myself was concerned only as I saw my fellows , he so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tears and Laments , and the most ardent prayers wch which thereupon he put up ( for I well remember he called the whole Family to Prayer upon the Occasion ) that an abhorence was generated in me young as I was ( about 13 years old ) at the Party at whose anvils so great a wickedness was forged whc which blessed be God has to this day continued . " // JESTER : JOHN DONNE THE YOUNGER A SEVENTEENTHCENTURY JESTER : JOHN DONNE THE YOUNGER AMONG the little-known poems of that beloved friend of Izaak Walton , Charles Cotton , is a cheerful one entitled " An Epistle to John Bradshaw , Esq. , " 1 in the course of which Cotton says : " And here I can not pretermit To that Epitome of Wit , Knoledge and Art , to him whom we Saucily call , and I more saucily Presume to write the little d . All that your Language can improve Of Service , Honour , and of Love : After whose name the rest I know Would sound so very flat and low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind them up Et Caetera 's . I was , at first , rather at a loss to know to whom Cotton was referring in these lines , but after reflection 59 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries I remembered that the great Dean of St. Paul 's had a son , also John Donne , who had edited most of his father 's works , though I was not aware he had written anything of his own . Turning to the Dictionary of National Biography , I found a short notice of the younger Donne by that distinguished scholar , the late Canon Augustus Jes sopp , a notice of very great severity , in which no single good word is said of the younger Donne 's life , works , or character ; in short , he is represented as a dissolute and contemptible creature . But the good-natured praise bestowed on him by his contemporary Cotton , whose charm of character and genius has long been recognised by those intimate with his writings , 2 sug gested to me that the younger Donne 's personality might , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Canon Jessopp . Accordingly , I determined to probe further into this rather obscure corner of literary history . My researches have con vinced me that the account given by Canon Jessopp is one-sided and unfair , and the present essay is an attempt to portray the younger Donne not as a mere 6o A ' Seventeenth-Century jester contemptible debauchee , but rather as an ingenuous and incorrigible jester , which such of his published works as exist unquestionably prove him to be . Canon Jessopp black-washes the younger Donne with very vigorous applications of the biographical brush . I do not intend to apply a reverse process of whitewash : I merely seek to scrape off some of the black and to show that the great Dean 's son was not wholly unworthy . The details of the younger Donne 's life can be shortly given . He was the eldest son of the Dean by his wife , Ann More , being one of a family of twelve , and he was born in 16o4 . He was educated at West minster , and Christ Church , Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the B.A. and M.A. degrees . It was while at Oxford that a very ugly incident happened , which the relentless Canon Jes sopp presents in its most lurid light . John Donne was riding with a friend when a small boy of eight startled the friend 's horse . John Donne lost his temper and struck the boy on the head with his riding-whip . Three weeks afterwards the child died , and in due course Donne was tried for manslaughter . The incident actually happened in the autumn of 1633 . The trial took place in the summer of 1634 , and the following entry thereon is found in 61 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries Archbishop Laud 's History of his Chancellorship of Oxford : 4 A.D. 1634 . " John Dunn of C.C. , master of arts , for the supposed killing of a boy , called Humphrey Dunt ; and John Goffe " for another alleged crime etc. . . . " these two were legally tried before the under-steward of the University , Mr. Unton Crooke , the 26th of August , 1634 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are preserved at Oxford , it appears that the doctors could not testify to any particular cause of Humphrey Dunt 's death , there being no appearance of hurt . As represented by Canon Jessopp , we are left with the impression of Donne 's guilt , despite the acquittal . Suspicion may or may not be justified in this case . Nevertheless , the result of the trial , as recorded with commendable precision by Archbishop Laud , is clear : Donne was acquitted . In passing it may be noted that Mr. Edmund Gosse , in the course of his biography of Donne 's father , describes the circumstances much more fairly : 5 indeed , he protests against bitter animad versions in another part of his book ( Vol . II , p. 311 ) . . . " there is no sense in denying to him ( Donne the younger ) the possession of every natural virtue . " For , to do Dr. Jessopp justice , it must be admitted 62 A Seventeenth-Century ester that he is not alone in his biographical condemnation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , thus refers to the younger Donne in his Athen.e Oxonienses ( II , 503 ) : 6 " Our author Dr. Jo . Donne left behind him a son of both his names , but of none of his virtues , manners or generous qualities , and , therefore , by many his memory is condemned to utter oblivion . " And again in the Fasti ( I , 503 ) : " He . . . had all the advantages imaginable tendred to him to tread in the steps of his virtuous Father , but his nature being vile , he proved no better all his life time than an atheistical buffoon , a banterer , and a person of over-free thoughts . " This latter passage is quoted by Dr. Jessopp as summing up the character of the younger Donne , but it is unfortunate that Dr. Jessopp stopped there , for Wood , after stating that Donne was " valued by King Charles II , " continues : " On Feb. 23 an . 1662 was published or printed his fantastical and conceited will , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humour of the person may be discovered . " ( We shall quote this extra-ordinary document hereafter . ) " There is no doubt but that he was a man of 63 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries sense , and parts ; which , had they been applied to a good use , he might have proved beneficial in his generation . " Now this latter passage mitigates the severity of the former , at least it might be described as giving the devil his due . And when it is remembered that Wood himself was a very peevish fellow , though of profound learning , of whom it was said " that he never spake well of any man , " we need not accept his judgment as final . Indeed , we might add that Wood 's biographer in the Dictionary of National Biography , speaking of the " bitter feelings " aroused at the time by the publication of the 4thenx Oxonienses and Fasti in 1691-2 , says : " Wood was himself fond of severe reflections , and all through his work had adopted reckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare details of Donne 's life before proceeding to examine his literary efforts , by which it will be submitted his true character is revealed . Between 1634 and 1638 Donne was , apparently , in Italy , at the University of Padua , where he took the degree of " Doctor of the Civil Law , " and in the latter year the same degree was conferred on him by the University of Oxford . About this time he also appears to have been ordained , and between the years 1638 and 164o two or three livings were conferred upon him by various patrons . But he was not cut out to be a parish priest , and , in fact , he does not 64 A Seventeenth-Century jester appear to have devoted much time to the usual paro chial duties . It is noteworthy that from 164o to 1662 he dates his letters " from my house in Covent Garden . " 7 In a letter to Edward Carter , Esq. , preserved in the University Library at Cambridge , the younger Donne makes a spirited defence , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in this parish I have published a volume of eighty sermons preached by my Father , and have prepared sixty more which are licensed and entered in the Printers ' Halle ; which is as farr as I can drive them untill the times aliter . . . . Sir , I write this to you that you may judge what a sad condition a schollar is in , when , at a public vestry of this parish , I was told by a pitifull ignorant baker I was an idle man and never preached . " 8 I have said that Donne was not cut out to be a parish priest , and , indeed , it seems he was not cut out for Ordination at all . Apparently he was a person , to use Wood 's expression , " of over-free thoughts , " or , at any rate , occasionally of over-free expression of them . Probably it is this fact that has coloured Dr. Jessopp 's judgment of his character . And here it should be stated that the responsibility for his son 's adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries part at least , with the Dean , his father . The latter , in the course of a letter to his friend , Mrs. Cokain , says : " But , my noble Sister , though I am far from drawing my son unmaturely into orders , or putting into his hands any Church with cure ; yet there are many prebends and other helps in the Church which a man without taking orders may be capable of , and for some such I might change a living with cure , and so begin to accommodate a son in some prepara tion " 9 Again , in a letter dated 1625 , in which he appears to contemplate that his son would be his literary executor , the Dean , referring to some eighty sermons he has revised , says : " Of which my son , who , I hope , will take the same profession , or some other in the world of understanding , may hereafter make some use . " As Mr. Gosselo points out , this letter would seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his father 's manuscripts after his death , a suggestion based on a cryptic passage in a letter from Dr. Henry King , Bishop of Chichester , to Izaak Wal ton : " How these " ( the papers , which the Dean is said to have entrusted to King , though no mention 66 A Seventeenth-Century jester is made of it in his will ) " were got out of my hands , you , who were the messenger of them , and how lost both to me and yourself , is not now seasonable to complain . " 12 If it was not then " seasonable to complain , " we , who enjoy the fruits of the younger Donne 's editorial labours , must regard it as still less seasonable now . On the contrary , we are under a deep debt of gratitude to the younger Donne for his careful preservation of his father 's works . As Mr. Gosse handsomely acknowledges , he did " more than anyone else to preserve his ( the elder Donne 's ) reputation and prestige . " 13 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donne published will sufficiently testify to his editorial industry : Table In addition to these works of his father , the younger Donne also edited A Collection of Letters made by Sir Tobie Matthew , in a 66o , and the poems of William Herbert , third Earl of Pembroke , in the same year . 67 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries Prefaces are prefixed to each of the works Donne edited , and it will be useful to notice such of these as throw some light on his life and character . The LXXX Sermons , published in 164o , were dedicated to King Charles I. According to a statement made by Donne in his 1661 edition of the XXPI Sermons , that king had sent for him and ordered him to re-collect and publish his father 's sermons . In the same ( 1661 ) edition is also printed a letter which the Bishop of Peterborough sent to Donne ( the younger ) in 164o , on the latter 's presenting him with a copy of the LXXX Sermons .

The Lord Philip Harbert , " in the course of which he wittily explains : " It the treatise was writ long since by my Father , and by him forbid both the Presse , and the Fire ; neither had I subjected it now to the publique view , but that I could finde no certain way to defend it from the one , but by committing it to the other ; for , since the beginning of the War my study having been often searched , all my books , and almost my brains , 68 fl Seventeenth-Century ester by their continuall alarums sequestered , for the use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , being then a Manuscript , a danger of being utterly lost , and a danger of being utterly found ; and fathered by some of those wild Atheists , who as if they came into the World by conquest owne all other mens wits , and are resolved to be learned in despite of their Starres , that would fairly have inclined them to a more modest , and honest course of life . " The Fifty Sermons , 1649 , were dedicated by Donne to the " Right Hon. Basil , Earle of Denbigh , my very good Lord and Patron . " He also took care to enlist the support of the Commonwealth authorities before publishing this book , in order that he might deliver it to the world under their protection . In his 1661 edition of the XXVI Sermons he apologises for having , as it were , thus compounded with the Cromwellians in 1649 ; he explains that by so doing he saved the sermons from burning at the hands of the public executioner , and thus helped to maintain " the banks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did then invade her . . . for now began to swarme and muster the Ebionites , Sabellians , Jovinians , Eutichians , Corpocratians , Sethians , Cerinthians , Theodotians , Nicolaitans , Samocetanians , Apolenarians , Montaneans , all against the second Person of the Trinity . " You can almost hear Donne mouthing out this jibe 69 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries at the expense of the Sectarians , who had so lately thundered forth from many an Anglican pulpit . But in these prefaces he does not always jest , though usually there is a half-jest tucked away somewhere . His preface to the 1651 edition of his father 's letters , which he dedicated " to the most virtuous and excellent Lady Mr1s Bridget Dunch , " is a good example of his command of condensed and distinguished style . He begins : " MADAM , - " It is an argument of the Immortality of the Soul , that it can apprehend , and imbrace such a Conception ; and it may be some kinde of Prophecy , of the continuance and lasting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves , I can not say into parts , but corners of the World , they have recollected and united themselves , meeting at once , as it were , at the same Spring from whence they flowed , but by Succession . " Then as he proceeds he can not resist a small jest : " One beame of your Grace and Favour . . . will quicken it this remnant of the dead Author with a new Spirit and defend it from all fire ( the fate of most Letters ) but the last . " And in his introduction to the edition of his father 's Paradoxes , etc. , in 1652 , there is this very delightful illustration of his argument that his father 's youthful efforts are as worthy of note as those of his riper judgment : 70 /1 Seventeenth-Century ester Of Solomon , we have the Song , as well as the Proverbs ; Joseph is presented to us in his gay and painted Coat of many Colours , as in his Chair of State , when he sate over Egypt ; we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a grave King , and holy Prophet ; and perhaps he did as much with his Pibble and Sling then , as he did after with his whole Army . " This passage is , indeed , a piece of self-revelation : for the younger Donne , up to the day of his death , looked in life for the gay and painted coat of many colours , with the eager longing of a child . The latest editorial effort of the younger Donne , as regards his father 's writings , was the edition of the XXPI Sermons , in 1661 . We have already had occasion to refer to this edition , as it throws more light than his other editorial labours on his own life and character . He dedicated the Sermons to King Charles II , but doubtless he had his tongue in his cheek when he speaks " of that exemplar Piety , that reigns in your Sacred Majesty , which will be a living Sermon even to those Reverend Pastors " appointed to restore the Church and to awaken " the Light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by your Glorious Return , or a new Fiat . " The preface to the Reader contains some more jesting on the pecuniary position of editors , and a really brilliant " mot " on the subject of reversions . He begins ingenuously : 7 1 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries " When the Jews intended the building of the Temple , their wise King Solomon sent to Hiram many thousand measures of corn , knowing that the Fellers of Timber , the hewers of stone , and those that bore the burden , must be provided for as well as the great Officers , the Overseers . Fac hoc et wives , was often repeated to me when I undertook this work , and a fair reward was promised me ; but at last I am con-strained hoc facere ut vivam , to publish them at my own cost that I may sell them ; which I had not been able to perform , if I had not been assisted by the bounty of our most I lonourable Lord Chancellor , 14 ( who is not only content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that these Preachers should have good Sermons ) , and I am to rest satisfied with that Text , that tells us , that to those that have much , more shall be given ; and those that have nothing ( and there is nothing so near of Kin to Nothing , as a Reversion ) , that that they have shall be taken away . ' " We need not refer in detail to the editions of Sir Tobie Matthew 's Letters , or Lord Pembroke 's Poems , both of which Donne introduced to the public . The prefaces to both are conceived in his usual style , for it will already have been apparent that he was an incorrigible jester . His preface to the edition of the Pembroke poems is interesting , as in it he claims kinship with the Herbert family , which is likely enough , as the Donnes were themselves of Welsh 72 fl Seventeenth-Century Jester descent . Moreover , there is a mordant description of the depressing effect of the Cromwellian regime on literature . He speaks of Pembroke 's poetic fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Trumpets , when all the Muses seemed to be fled , and to have left nothing behind them , but a few lame Iambicks , canting at the corners of our desolate streets . . . . " We have thus far followed Donne 's career as an editor of the works of others , in the main of his very distinguished father . We have now to show him as an author on his own account . In 1662 was printed " by R.W. for M. Wright , at the King 's Head in the Old Bailey , " a small book with the following curious title-page : Donne 's Satyr . Containing 1 . A short Map of Mundane Vanity . 2 . A Cabinet of Merry Conceits . 3 . Certain pleasant Propositions and Questions , with their merry Solutions and Answers . Being very Useful , Pleasant and Delightful to all ; and offensive to none . By Jo . Donne . Donne died early in 1663 , so that this work , apart 73 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries from his extraordinary will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canon Jessopp thus refers to this book : " Some months before his death he issued a very gross volume in small 8vo , entitled Donne 's Satyr , etc. " 1b " A very gross volume ! " With this description in my mind , it was with a sense almost of guilty indecency that I asked for this book in the Reading Room at the British Museum . A tiny volume was in due course handed to me , so small as though in itself it were but the jest of a book , measur ing about four and a half inches by three and a half , and about half an inch thick . First of all I read the " Epistle Dedicatory , " addressed " to the Right Worshipful and his very good Friend , Sir Francis Edwardes Baronet , and to his truly virtuous Mother , the right Worshipful Lady , Sicely Edwardes of Shrewsbury , in the County of Salop , Widow , the Author entirely wisheth the full accomplishment of their choice desires both here , and hereafter . " This seemed super-eminently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceedingly amus ing writing , but nothing in the smallest degree indecent or even mildly improper . Thereafter I 74 A Seventeenth-Century 7ester read the verses or small rhymes of which the three parts of the book , " the Map , " " the Cabinet , " and " pleasant Propositions , " consist . The great majority of these are harmless jokes , witticisms , or apophthegms in verse . A few contain rather broad jests , the sort of things Falstaff says now and again , and which , surely , are infinitely preferable to , and far more amusing than , the stale jokes with their flagrant vulgarities and " double entendre " which make up so much of modern musical comedy . A very few might be described as " gross " by a modern reader . And here again it might be argued that obvious grossness is less harmful than the indecent suggestion which characterises certain works of modern fiction . But the truth is , it is not worth while for one generation to cast a stone at another in these matters , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . In any case , to condemn this strange work as " a very gross volume " seems to me a mere misuse of language , giving a quite unfair impression of the book and its author . As this work has never been reprinted ( and quite probably never will be ) , is wholly unknown to-day save possibly to one or two odd students of seventeenth-century literature , is so eccentric as to be a literary curiosity , and , finally , calls into one 's very presence the shade of a strange personality who lived nearly three centuries ago , I propose to give the reader some idea of its contents . I trust the passages I have 75 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries selected will cause the same quiet and harmless amusement which they caused me when I transcribed them from the rare and tiny book , which takes up an almost invisible fraction of space in the vast book-shelves of the British Museum . And first of the preface , which explains that the merry conceits were " penn 'd at some interims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for yours his Patron 's now , " for after the miseries of the Commonwealth period a little refreshment should follow ; " after melancholy mirth is the more musical , sweet , acceptable , delightful and pleasant . . . . " He has " pretermitted divine matters , for , non ludendum cum sanctis , remembering that the Fly playing with the candle had his wings clipped for his over-boldness . " Nor does he meddle with State affairs , nor point at particular persons . Then follows a brilliant piece of rapier-thrusting at those who would enjoy the best of both worlds , Cromwellian or Royalist : " Since this late , though long desir 'd thrice happy Alteration , far beyond the expectation of humane wit ( for therein was digitus Dei , the visible power of the invisible Divine Providence perspicuously manifested to all the World ) , very many , and those great ones too , who though they had the cream of former times , have clean turn 'd Cat in pan , and would have all ( if it might be ) they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since a remarkable Machiavellian Maxime , that qui nescit dissimulare , nescit vivere ( i.e. ) 76 A Seventeenth-Century jester who can not dissemble can not live ; which though it were a Heathenish speech , yet was never put more in practice then than in these Phanatick times ; for he that can not metamorphose his shape like Proteus , vary his hiew like the Polypus , change his colour like the Camelion , bear two faces under a hood like Janus , comply with every Planet like Mercury , vary and change like the Moon constantly , turn with the weathercock , adulate with Aristippus , equivocate with Synon , dissemble with Gnatho , hunt with the Hound , and hold with the Hare , carry fire in the one hand , and water in the other ; and in a word , who can not temporise at all times , with all persons , and in all places , that man knows not how to look or live in this hypocritical , perverse , and crooked Generation .

" And then in the way of raconteurs who once embarked , crowd on more sail , he goes on : 77 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries " Another Gentleman in an eminent office at Court in the K.

" This leads our jester to a short disquisition on the oak-like qualities of Royalists , with an appropriate reference to the tree in which " his most Sacred Majesty , when his innocent integrity was most eagerly pursued after by those raging and ravening , bloodseeking and blood-sucking wolves , " found " a most happy Asylum . " We are now come to the " Satyr " itself , divided into its three parts ? the " Map of Mundane Vanity , " the " Cabinet of Merry Conceits , " and " Certain pleasant Propositions and Questions , etc .

Of Mundane Vanity . When Solomon had tried all variety Of mundane pleasures , ev'n to full satiety ; And after throughly weigh 'd the world 's condition , And therein man 's : concludes with this Position , All that man can in this wide world inherit , Is vain , and but vexation of the spirit . 2 .

Man 's life 's compar 'd to many things I finde , For Job doth similise it to the winde ; James to a vapour , Esay 16 unto grass , David t'a shadow , Paul unto a race , Some to a sleep , and others to a dream , And some to the swift running of a stream ; Some to a Poast , some to a shuttle flung , Some to a span , some to a tale or song ; Some to a bubble in a showre of rain , Which soon is up , and soon is out again : 8o A Seventeenth-Century jester Some to a cobweb as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair flower which soon doth fade ; All which ( with many more ) do shew ( in brief ) The swift celerity of man 's short life . The last two of these selections from the " Map of Mundane Vanity " show that the younger Donne might have written poetry if he had wished . I find myself repeating over the two lines : " Why do we not ( as cloid ) then loathe this light ? Because life ne 're so bitter still is sweet . " There is beauty there , and truth and simplicity , and one feels that for a moment the mummer has dropped his mask . And the other " Of the same and of the brevity thereof , " by the accumulation of beautiful biblical similes , achieves an extraordinary atmosphere of the evanescence of things .

Anno Dom . " This note warms one 's heart to the younger Donne . Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries He must have been a very human fellow ; and there is something singularly pleasing in this ingenuous way of recording so untoward an event , solely due to his incorrigible custom of joking . The " Cabinet of Merry Conceits " consists of a series of jests on a great variety of everyday seventeenth-century topics , the signs of the Zodiac being one of them . But first we begin with an everyday topic of all the ages : 2 . Of the Sun Tavern . One staggering out of the Sun Tavern came , And being far in drink , and out of frame , A friend him meets and greets , but not a word This stupefied Sot could him afford ; And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not stand to anything he said ; His face being foully fleckt , and both his eyes With drink main red , his friend to him thus cries , I know where you were late I 'll hold a gun , For your face shows that you were in the Sun . 5 . Of Galaxia , via lactea , or the Milky Way in Heaven . One asking whence , and upon what occasion , This Heavenly Sign had first its appellation ; Another to him merrily reply 'd , That at the latter end of Christmastide , The Gods and Goddesses then each with either Agreeing for to wastle altogether ; Fair Ganimedes was by Jove 's command As messenger dismissed out of hand , 82 A Seventeenth-Century jester To fetch some milk , who coming back again With a great bowl , the Dog-star bark 'd amain , And he being sore afraid lest it would bite him , The Moon then being under cloud to light him , ?

For in the Moonshine I 've oft lookt and waited , Yet ne 're saw Bull or Bear by that Dog baited . 8 . Of a falling Meteor .

One took some Flyes out of a cup , and when He himself had drunk , he put them in again : My reason is ( quoth he ) to tell thee true , I love not Flyes , but may be some here do .

" 84 fl Seventeenth-Century ester We will close our selections from the " Cabinet " with a conceit of quite another kind , in which the younger Donne for a moment lets the poetry in him creep out , though only in four short lines , lines which would have honoured Herrick : 113 . Of a new-born Babe dying . I dyed as soon as in the World I came , Depriv 'd of Baptism and without a Name . In Book of life then nameless me record , For my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The book ends with " certain pleasant Propositions and Questions , with their merry Solutions and Answers .

Tell me , I pray what kinde of Apple was't In Eden Eve gave Adam for to taste ? A. A Bitter sweet we truly it may call , For it prov 'd so to them , and to us all ; ' T was pleasant to the sight , sweet to the taste , But bitter when from Eden they were cast : And so that bitter sweet proves unto all , Redeem 'd by faith in Christ from Satan 's thrall . 5 Q. Why did God say , let 's make an Helper meet For man , in that society is sweet ? 85 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries A. She prov 'd indeed no less , for in a trice She help 'd poor 14dam out of Paradise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Merry May Song for this year of our Lord , 1662 . To a pleasant tune . " This song can not be said to have particular poetic merit , but there is a pleasant verse about the country flowers : The Primrose meet And the Cowslip sweet , The Harebel , the Crowes-foot , and Dazie ; The Bolt upright , And the Lady smock-white , You may there take up if it please ye . This poem must have been the last composition of John Donne the younger , for he appears to have died early in the year 1663 . At any rate , his will was printed on February 23 in that year , and from that time there seems to be no further record of him . We may fittingly close our review of the life and character of the younger Donne with his will , " wherein , " as Wood observed , " the humour of the person may be discovered . " Already it will have been apparent that John Donne the younger was at least no ordinary mortal . Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but conjecture that he is the John Donne who was married to Mary Staples at Camber-86 fl Seventeenth-Century jester well Church on March 27 , 162717 We can only get to know what manner of man he really was by examining his literary work , and this work , as I have attempted to show , proves that , whatever else he was , he was certainly one of those relatively rare persons , who go through life with a jest on their lips . And the vast majority of his recorded jests are not gross , and represent his personality in no unamiable light . This is all I have attempted to show . I feel that Canon Jessopp 's account in the Dictionary of National Biography is unfair in that it stresses only the unplea sant side of a curious life : the incident at Oxford , his apparently unpastoral clerical career , the alleged " grossness " of his writings , the unfavourable opinion of the mordant Anthony a Wood . Against this I have stressed his acquittal in the Oxford affair , his invaluable labours as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantry of by far the larger published part of his small literary output , and the kindly opinion entertained of him by the charming Cotton . Finally , I plead that he should be taken merely as himself , and not with a backward glance at the beauti ful figure of his father . Great men may suffer from small sons , but small sons also suffer from great fathers . And now we will read the will18 87 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries Dr. Donne 's ( the younger 's ) last Will and Testament . July 21 , 1657 . Video meliora proboque .

And I desire to be carried to my grave by the ordinary bearers of the dead , without troubling any of my friends , or letting them know of my death by any means but by being put in the earth . And I desire my executor to interpret my meaning in this request by my word , and not by his own discretion ; who , peradventure , for fashion sake , and apprehending we shall never meet , may think to order things better for my credit ; ( God be thanked ) I have not lived by juggling , therefore I desire to dye and be buried without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdensome to my friends in my life , I would not load their shoulders being dead . 88 i1 Seventeenth-Century jester I desire and appoint the Right Honourable Jerome , Earl of Portland , to be my executor , hoping that for all his cares of me , and kindnesses to me , he will undertake to see this my Will punctually performed , especially concerning my burial . To the most excellent , good , kind , virtuous , honourable Lady Portland , I give all the rest that I have in this Will unbequeathed : and I do not this foolishly ( as may at the first sight appear ) , because my lord is my executor , but because I know it will please the gaiety of her humour , which ought to be preserved for all their sakes that have the honour and happiness to be known unto her .

To my cousin , Henry Stafford , son to my kind friend , Mr. William Stafford , I give all my printed books , which although they are of no great value , yet they may seem proportionable to his youth , and may serve as a memorial to incline him to be as indulgent to poor scholars as his father and grandfather have been 89 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries before him .

She had great knoledge , and a lively sense of things . She soon understood what belonged to a princess , and took state on her , rather too much . She writ well , and had begun the duke 's life , of which he showed me a volume ; it was all drawn from his journal : and he intended to have employed me in carrying it on . She was bred to great strictness in religion , and practised secret confession . Morley told me he was her confessor ; she began at 12 , and continued under his direction till , upon her father 's disgrace , he was put from the court . She was generous and friendly ; but was too severe an enemy . " This portrait of Anne Hyde , Duchess of York , is by the master-hand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outstanding and , for us , romantic figures who pass across the 95 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries stage of history from the Restoration to the age of Anne . In a period when so many eminent persons wrote memoirs and diaries , it is a pity that very little has come down to us from the pen of Anne Hyde herself ; her life of her husband , to which Burnet refers , has not survived . On the other hand , the circumstances of her career were so extraordinary that those who watched events , and wrote about them , either in the thrilling and romantic way of Count Hamilton , or the grand and historical way of Lord Clarendon and Bishop Burnet and the Duke of York himself ? afterwards King James II ? or of the self-revealing , minute , and brilliant way of Pepys , or the courtly and pleasant way of Evelyn , have told us , perhaps , all we need to know . For during the greater part of her relatively short life Anne Hyde moved in the centre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaft of light on that fascinating , swiftly moving and vital scene with which the name of Charles II is for ever associated . In accompanying Anne Hyde along the ways she walked two and a half centuries and more ago , we shall rub shoulders with all the world : with kings and queens , ministers of state and bishops , soldiers and sailors , men of letters and painters of pictures , and plain wayfaring men and women , with all those , indeed , who make up the coloured throng of life . And not a person is uninteresting , for it seems that whatever else men or women were in that much-96 flnne Hyde : Early Life criticised age , they were not dull ; bores were not tolerated , and , in truth , hardly seem to have existed . Above all , it was a time of the most extraordinary contrasts . People are too apt to associate the period of the Restoration with mere wickedness or frivolity . But in contrast to a vicious buffoon like the Duke of Buckingham , there is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blood , the holy and worshipful Izaak Walton ; to the frivolous talent of Rochester , the tremendous genius of Milton .2 And even a man like Buckingham was not wholly con temptible , for he had a brilliant wit , and as a politician has , to his great credit , his consistent advocacy of religious toleration . Moreover , while Charles II himself is always remembered for the number and beauty of his mistresses , he is sometimes forgotten as the founder of the Royal Society , and the patron of literature and of art . Had that pleasant and unassuming Wiltshire coun try gentleman , Mr. Henry Hyde , of Dinton , been told before his death that his third son , Edward , would become Lord High Chancellor of England and Earl of Clarendon , that his granddaughter , Anne Hyde , would become Duchess of York , and his great-grand daughters Mary and Anne Queens of England , it may be conjectured that he might , from sheer awe 97 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and astonishment , have died of an apoplexy sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is of him of whom his son , in his autobiography , has left a very perfect picture , and of whom he spoke " as not only the best Father but the best Friend and the best Com panion he ever had or could have , " 3 that Bishop Burnet relates an anecdote which he says Lord Claren don told Lady Ranelagh : " He ( his son Edward ) , when he began to grow eminent in his profession , came down to see his aged father , a gentleman of Wiltshire , and , one day , as they were walking in the fields together , his father told him that men of his profession did often stretch law and prerogative to the prejudice of the liberty of the subject , to recommend and advance themselves ; so he charged him , if ever he grew to any eminence in his profession , that he should never sacrifice the laws and liberties of his country to his own interest , or to the will of a prince . He repeated this twice : and immediately he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died in a few hours . " 4 Burnet relates this story which Clarendon has not recorded in his autobiography , the circumstances of his father 's death being there rather differently des cribed , to illustrate the great Lord Clarendon 's regard for " the ancient liberties of England , as well as for Anne Hyde : Early Life the rights of the crown , " a regard which , Burnet says , was heightened by the domestic incident just related . We have ventured thus , for one brief moment , to call back from his still resting-place in Salisbury Cathedral the ghost of Henry Hyde , not so much for genealogical as for ( if one may invent the word ) eugenealogical reasons . For it may , with some con fidence , be surmised that the honest and quiet virtues of Queen Mary , the wife of King William III , and of " Good Queen Anne , " were inherited rather from the obscure branch of Wiltshire squires and their country wives than from the high line of Stuart and Mary Queen of Scots .5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reluctance , for our thoughts keep wandering back to Wiltshire , and the fields where those two once walked and held such good discourse ? and attend the birth of the subject of this essay . In a very small notebook now preserved in the British Museum 8 ? one of the few autograph relics of Anne Hyde ? there is the following entry : " I was born the 12 day of March old stile in the yeare of our Lord 1637 at Cranbourne Lodge neer Windsor in Berkshire and lived in my owne country till I was 12 yeares old haveing in that time seen the ruin both of Church and State and the murtheringe of my Kinge. " 99 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries Anne wrote these words when she was a girl of fifteen , and despite the somewhat stilted and priggish language , we catch a glimpse of the terrific effect which Charles I 's execution had not only indeed on devoted Royalists , but on plain men everywhere. ? Of Cranbourne it may be said in passing that Pepys , many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1665 , at night ) during one of his numerous peregrinations " where in the dark I perceive an old house new build-ing with a great deal of rubbish , and was fain to go up a ladder to Sir G. Carteret 's chamber . . . . Ito bed in my Lady 's chamber that she uses to lie in , and where the Duchess of York , that now is , was born . " 8 Almost immediately after the King 's death , in January , 1649 , the Chancellor , who was himself in Jersey , arranged for the withdrawal of his wife and family from England to Antwerp . There they remained until the autumn of 1653 , when they removed to Breda where the Princess of Orange assigned them a house rent free . During these years of exile the Hyde family , in common with other devoted Royalist families , suffered the most appalling privations . In a letter to Secretary Nicholas , dated October 19 , 1650 , the Chancellor refers to " the intolerable necessity my wife is in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says : I00 Anne Hyde : Early Life " I have not been master of a crown these many months , am cold for want of clothes and fire , and owe for all the meat which I have eaten these three months , and to a poor woman who is no longer able to trust ; and my poor family at Antwerp ( which breaks my heart ) is in as sad a state as I am. " 9 The removal of the Hyde family to Breda was very shortly followed by an event which , as Clarendon afterwards observed in his autobiography , " may appear to many an extraordinary Operation of Pro-vidence , in giving the first rise to what afterwards succeeded ; though of a Nature so transcendant , as can not be thought to have any relation to it . " 10 This event was the promotion of Anne Hyde , in her seven-teenth year , to the place of maid of honour to the Princess of Orange . Lord Clarendon ( in his auto-biography just mentioned ) is at pains to relate in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards an Influence upon his Fortune , and a very great one upon the Peace and Quiet of his Mind , and of his Family . " He is insistent that from the very beginning he opposed the proposal , which was vehemently pressed by the Princess of Orange , who seems to have taken a great fancy to Anne , on the ground that he did not want his daughter to be separated from her mother , nor to take up a Court IOI Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries life , " which he did in Truth perfectly detest . " His objections were , however , countered by the Princess of Orange , who prevailed on her brother , Charles II himself , to speak to the Chancellor , the King saying that " He knew not how the Chancellor could , or why he should omit such an Opportunity of providing for his Daughter in so honourable a Way . " The Chancellor respectfully replied that he " could not dispute the Reasons with him , " repeating however his plea that he did not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little cause to doubt the Chancellor 's sincerity in this matter ; the reasons for his detestation of a Court life for his daughter are , indeed , not far to seek . He had been specially charged with the political care of the young king from his fifteenth year , and he knew his over-mastering weakness . Doubtless he remembered the affair at Jersey when the Prince , as he then was , though hardly emerged from boyhood , became the father of the first of that exceedingly numerous illegitimate offspring which has enriched the Peerage alone with no less than three existing dukedoms . And he had lived long enough at Paris to have formed very precise conclusions as to the possibilities of a continental Court life for a maid of honour in , for instance , the retinue of that remarkable monarch Louis XIV , Charles 's cousin . But despite his efforts , the Chancellor was borne down by the resolution of the Princess of Orange ; moreover , the good Dr. Morley , 1 02 Anne Hyde : Early Life afterwards Bishop of Winchester , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guileless enough to support the proposal as being likely to prove bene ficial to Anne . And as it turned out , in so far as the most dazzling worldly honours can be regarded as a blessing , the good Bishop was right . Furthermore , we suspect that the Chancellor 's wife was secretly of the same opinion as the Bishop , though to the Chancellor she appeared to share his averseness . During the period from 1654 to the year of the Restoration , 166o , in which year the courtly world was to be electrified by the circumstances surrounding the secret marriage of Anne Hyde with the Duke of York , we hear of Anne only in snatches of gossip . A few of her own 1e ; . ' rs will be found quoted in Mr. J. R. Henslowe 's boo ' , Anne Hyde , Duchess of York . But , though interesting , they are not very illuminating . The references to her , however , which have been preserved mainly in John Evelyn 's invaluable Diary and Correspondence , u show her to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aunt of Charles II , writing to Secretary Nicolas in September , 1654 , says : " I heare Mrs. Hide is to come to my Niece in Mrs. Killigrew 's place the former Maid of Honour who had died of the smallpox , which I am verie glad of , she is verie fitt for itt and a great favourit of mine . " A few months later , " I finde my favourit 103 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries grown everie way to her advantage . " This is fol-lowed by a letter dated Jan. 11 ( 1654 ? 5 ) from the " Hagh " : " We had a Royaltie a masquerade , though not upon twelf night , at Teiling , where my Niece was a gipsie and became her dress extreame well . . . Mrs. Hide a shepherdess and I assure you was verie handsome in it , none but her Mistress looked better than she did . I believe my Lady Hide and Mr. Chancelour will not be sorie to heare it , which I pray tell them from me. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles II , writing to Bennet , afterwards Earl of Arlington , in 1665 says : " I will try whether Sir S. Compton be so much in love as you say , for I will name Mrs. Hyde before him so by chance , that except he be very much smitten it shall not move him . " Early in 1656 the Princess of Orange visited her mother , Queen Henrietta Maria , at Paris , taking with her her maid of honour . The sequel to this visit is told so characteristically by one of the two chief actors in the scene , the Duke of York , that he must certainly speak for himself . " When the Princesse of Orange came to Paris to see the Queen her Mother , the Duke being ( there ) 104 Anne Hyde : Early Life at that time as has been before mention 'd , Mrs. Anne Wide was one of the Maids of Honour who ther attended her : it happen 'd that after some conversa tion together , The Duke fell in love with her , she having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less inclinable to the sexe , the , vas that of his Royall Highness in the first war : . - ch of his youth . She indeed shew 'd both her wiic and her virtue in managing the affaire so dexterously , that the Duke overmaster 'd by his passion , at last gave her a promise of marriage some time before the Restoration . " 14 James , Duke of York , was at this time a young man of twenty-three , but as the period of his youth coincided with the extraordinary social upheavals which began with the Civil Wars and ended only with the Restoration , he had passed through adven tures enough to do credit to a hardened veteran . Taken prisoner as a mere boy during the Civil Wars , he was confined in St. James 's Palace , from which , assisted by Colonel Bamfield , he effected his escape in 1648 by an exceedingly clever ruse . One night , after supper , he went to play at " hide and seek " with his brother and sister , at which game for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us 'd to hide himself in places so difficult to find " that it usually took the other children half an hour IOs Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries to search for him . On this particular night , the Duke having first taken the precaution to shut up in his sister 's room a little dog that was wont to follow him , crept out of the palace through a back door , met there the trusty Colonel Bamfield , proceeded with him in a coach as far as Salisbury House , stepped out and bolted down a side street to the river . There they took boat and got out a little lower down , proceeding to the house " of one , Loe , a Surgeon , where they found Mrs. Murray , who had women 's cloths in readiness to disguise the Duke . " Thus disguised , the Duke , Bamfield and a footman re-embarked in a barge of four oars and proceeded down the river with the tide . But the master of the barge was suspicious , and his suspicions " that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed , " for peeping through a cranny of the door into the barge room , where there was a candle burning before the Duke , he perceiv 'd his Royall Highness laying his leg upon the table , and plucking up his stocking in so unwomanish a manner , that he concluded his former surmizes of him were undoubted truths , as he afterwards acknowledged to them . " A confession of the Duke 's identity was now inevitable , but the master of the barge was a sportsman , and putting out the lights when they approached Gravesend , they slipped past " the block houses " there and arrived safely at a " Dutch pinck of seventy tons , that lay ready for them . . . . " io6 1nne Hyde : Early Life Thereafter , having narrowly escaped being grounded and shipwrecked between Flushing and Middleburg , the Duke disembarked in Holland and was met by the Prince of Orange , who conveyed him to his house at Honslardyke.15 This intensely exciting adventure , which is described in much detail and with great spirit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke when he was fifteen years old . Between this date and that of his first meeting with Anne Hyde , the Duke served with much distinction in no less than four campaigns in the army of the King of France under the famous M. de Turenne . Bishop Burnet says of him : " He was very brave in his youth , and so much magnified by Monsieur Turenne , that , till his marriage lessened him , he really clouded the King , and passed for the superior genius . He was naturally candid and sincere , and a firm friend , till affairs and his religion wore out all his first principles and inclina tions. " 16 We are so accustomed to think of James II as an intolerable person , whose ultimate dethronement was almost the least punishment that could be inflicted on him , that this pleasant picture may well make the reader rub his eyes . But there was another side to I07 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries his character which Burnet also describes , and which will be communicated in due course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished that Anne Hyde should have fallen in love with this exceptional young man . Nor can we wonder that the Duke , for his part , fell in love with Anne Hyde . Not only had he an exceedingly impressionable heart so that he was , as Burnet says , " perpetually in one amour or another , " but Anne herself was clearly possessed of a very attractive and powerful personality . Contemporary opinion seems to be divided as to her looks . Pepys , who is often disparaging in his refer ences to her , describes 17 how he saw her at the play one day ( April 20 , 1661 ) , " The Humoursome Lieutenant , " acted at the Cockpit before the King ; the Duke was there " and his Duchess ( which is a plain woman and like her mother , my Lady Chan cellor ) " ; but then Pepys was mainly taken up with watching the notorious but most beautiful Mrs. Palmer , " with whom the King do discover a great deal of familiarity . " Count Hamilton , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne that " although . . . no perfect Beauty , " yet there was " no brighter at the Court of Holland . " On the other hand , the Queen of Bohemia evidently thought her charming , and Reresby greatly admired her : " she was a very hand-some woman , and had a great deal of wit . " If the 108 /lime Hyde : Early Life portrait of her by Sir Peter Lely , 18 now at Hampton Court , is a faithful likeness we can only say that we entirely agree with Reresby and can but admire the Duke 's discrimination . It is this portrait that Pepys saw on June 18 , 1662 : " . . . to Lilly 's , the painters , where we saw among other rare things , the Duchess of York , her whole body , sitting in state in a chair , in white satin , and another of the King , that is half finished ; most rare things . " We have already seen that Sir Spencer Compton appears to have been an admirer . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in pencil , now so paled by time as to be almost indecipherable , in Anne 's notebook already referred to . The poem is called " the contented marter , " and runs : Since thy bright eyes I chanced to see I yeeld to loves divi nity , who before thought t was strangly odd to make an urchin boy a good indecipherable one smile or I thy convert &; thy marter dye if not first let them 109 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries imbrace the fire ile burne &; willing ly expire &; flye to the elisium for to prove the joye 's they have that dye for love thus the condem ned thinke it a blisse the fatall block &; axe to kisse . The youthful poet signs himself Dike Barde or Berde ? 6 In the same notebook are two very touching entries in French , signed separately " Anne Hyde . " The one says , " Je m'en vay mourir d'amour , mais ce n'est pas pour un infidele comme vous " ; the other , " Adieu pour jamais , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whether these heart cries have any reference to the great love affair of Anne 's life it is , of course , impossible to say . But in the light of all the circumstances surrounding that affair it seems not at all improbable . We must now leap over four years , and pass from the Continent to England , in order to assist at the sequel to the events already recorded . For we are to understand that until after the Restoration Anne Hyde and the Duke of York kept their mutual passion a profound secret . IIo Anne Hyde : Early Life Hardly had the King 's return been signalised in Whitehall on that memorable 29th of May , in the year 166o , by the shouts of the citizens of London , the prostration of the Parliament , and the congratu lations " from all the counties of England , " when the Duke of York , for very sufficient reasons , realised that the time for romantic secrecy in his relations with Anne Hyde was fast drawing to a close . There are three main authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Claren don ( in his great work , The Continuation , etc . ) , Bishop Burnet , and Count Hamilton ? and to these must be added the testimony of the Duke himself and the hearsay evidence of Pepys . Of these authorities incomparably the most important is Lord Clarendon , not only because of the far greater detail , but of the amazing character of his account which Macaulay described 20 as " the most extraordinary passage in autobiography . We except nothing even in the Confessions of Rousseau . " The main outlines of the story are beyond dispute , for they are conf ed directly or indirectly by all the authorities , but shall rely in the main on Clarendon , for the reasons already indicated , and because his account , from its very character , seems to bear the clear impress of truth . After a short prologue , to explain the immediate III Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and ultimate bearings of the affair on his own life , Clarendon thus begins : " The Chancellor , as soon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having a Design presently to marry her ; to which Purpose He had an Overture from a noble Family , on the behalf of a well-bred hopeful young Gentleman , who was the Heir of it . His Daughter quickly arrived at her Father 's House , to his great Joy , having always had a great Affection for her ; and She being his eldest Child , He had more Acquaintance with her than with any of his Children ; and being now of an Age fit for Marriage , He was well pleased that He had an Opportunity to place her in such a Condition , as with God 's Blessing was like to yield her much Content . She had not been long in England , when the Duke informed the King of the Affection and Engagement that had been long between them ; that They had been long contracted , and that She was with Child ' . And therefore with all imaginable Importunity He begged his Majesty 's Leave and Permission upon his Knees that He might publicly marry her , in such a Manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The King was much troubled with it , and more with his Brother 's Passion , which was expressed in a very wonderful Manner and with many Tears , protesting that if his Majesty should not give his Consent , He would immediately leave the Kingdom , and must spend his Life in foreign Parts . ' " In this predicament the King immediately sent for those two wise and devoted councillors , the Marquis II2 Anne Hyde : Early Life of Ormond , and the Earl of Southampton , explained the situation to them and asked them immediately to see the Chancellor . As soon as the Chancellor came , the Marquis frankly told him what had happened . The Chancellor was thunderstruck . " He broke out into a very immoderate Passion against the Wickedness of his Daughter , and said with all imaginable Earnestness , that as soon as He came Home , He would turn her out of his House , as a Strumpet , to shift for herself , and would never see her again . ' " His friends explained to him that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into new Commotions . " He would prefer his daughter were the Duke 's whore rather than his wife for He was not obliged to keep a Where for the greatest Prince alive . " But if she we- f indeed married " He was ready to give a posif . Judgement , in which he hoped their Lordships ould concur with him , that the King should immediately cause the Woman to be sent to the Tower , and to be cast into a Dungeon , under so strict a Guard , that no Person living should be admitted to come to her ; and then that an Act of Parliament should be immediately passed for the cutting off her Head , to which He would not only give his Consent , but would very willingly be the first Man that should propose it : And whoever knew the Man , will believe that He said all this very heartily . " At this moment the King entered the room and " perceiving by his Countenance the Agony the Chancellor was in , and his swollen H I13 Gossip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tears were fallen , He asked the other Lords What They had done and whether They had resolved on any Thing . ' " Lord Southampton , not unnaturally , said , pointing to the Chancellor , that he was " mad " and not fit for consultation . " Whereupon His Majesty looking upon him with a wonderful Benignity said , Chancellor , I knew this Business would trouble you ; and therefore I appointed your two Friends to confer first with you upon it . " That he must now " lay aside all Passion " and give him his advice . The Chancellor , though now more composed , merely repeated what he had said before , adding as an argument that a signal example of severity would deter any presumption in future . At this point the entry of the Duke of York stopped further discussion . The Chancellor went home and ordered his daughter " to keep her Chamber , and not to admit any visits . " But , as he afterwards learned , his orders were fruitless , the Duke finding " ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her , by the Administration of those who were not suspected by him , and who had the excuse , that They knew that They were married . ' " Time passed , and to the Chancellor 's astonishment the affair appeared to make no particular impression on plain men . On the other hand , the Queen Mother , always Clarendon 's enemy , hurried over from France to prevent " so great a Stain and Dishonour to the Crown . " I14 Anne Hyde : Early Life And now there developed among the Duke 's retinue a very abominable plot . Sir Charles Berkeley , Captain of the Duke 's Guard , " a young man , " as Clarendon observes , " of a dissolute Life , and prone to all Wickedness in the Judgment of all sober Men , " swore a false oath that Anne had been unfaithful to the Duke , and had had relations with him , Berkeley . To his lasting shame the Duke believed him , and resolved to forswear his marriage and never to see Anne again . The incorrigible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Clarendon . According to him Berkeley was not the only criminal ; but other " men of honour , " Lord Arran , Germain , Talbot , and Killigrew all deposed to various familiarities with Anne . Talbot 's lie must be told on accou t of its absurdity . He " depos 'd , That she had made an Appointment wi him , in the Chancellor 's Closet , while he was in Council , by such a Token , that not minding what was upon the Table , and being wholly intent upon other matters , they had spilt an Ink-bottle upon a Letter of four Pages ; for which the King 's Monkey , who was charg 'd with the Accident , had been a long while in Disgrace . " 21 Talbot was followed by Killigrew , whose story was so deliberately extravagant that the Duke realised it was mere banter , and according to Hamilton , leaving his friends with an air of much mystery , he shortly Its Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries afterwards sent for Berkeley and Lord Ossory . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies had succeeded . They found the Duke with Anne , whose eyes were bathed in tears , while the Chancellor leaned against the wall " big with something . " To their abject amazement the Duke turned serenely to them and said , " As you are the two Men at Court I esteem most , I would have you to be the first that shall have the Honour to salute the Duchess of York : There she is . . . " It is almost impossible not to believe that Count Hamilton , with his obvious love for a good story , has not embroidered this . If there was one quality that the Duke of York seems to have lacked more than any other , it was a sense of humour , and only a genius at jesting , such as Charles himself , could have arranged such a scene as this : Hamilton says that the Duke had previously seen the King , and this may be the explanation . But we must return to Clarendon 's account . On October 22 , 166o , Anne gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of life bore the title of Charles , Duke of Cambridge . It chanced that the King was at the Chancellor 's house at a Cabinet meeting when the infant was on the point of entering the world . Accordingly he directed the Chancellor " to send for the Lady Marchioness of Ormond , the Countess of Sunderland and other Ladies of known Honour and Fidelity to the Crown , to be present with her . " To these were added our old friend Dr. I16 Anne Hyde : Early Life Morley , the Bishop of Winchester who , says Clarendon , " in the Interval of her greatest Pangs , and sometimes when they were upon her , was present , and asked her such Questions as were thought fit for the Occasion . " These questions were blunt enough , namely as to the parentage of the child . Anne answered vehemently that it was the Duke 's . Her replies to this extraordinary episcopal crossexamination , incredible indeed to modern minds in its circumstances , were it not fc ? . the undoubted fact that our seventeenth-century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , iJ e present . All indeed but that impossible person the Duke himself . Yet it is beyond question that he and Anne were secretly " contracted " in marriage ? such a contract in those days being to all intents and purposes as good as a marriage ? on November 24 , 1659 , at Breda , and that a secret marriage service was performed at Worcester House on September 3 , 166o . Nevertheless , if Clarendon is to be believed , the Duke still obstinately trusted the truth of Berkeley 's outrageous and colossal lie . So much so that he had the impertinence to threaten the Chancellor , on the erroneous supposition that the latter was about to have the whole matter discussed in Parliament . The Chancellor in the course of his reply to these threats , and in denying that he had any such intention , said " that if his Highness had done any Thing towards 117 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries or against him which He ought not to have done , there was One who is as much above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could both censure and punish it . " Meanwhile the King showed the Chancellor every mark of royal favour . He made him a baron , he gave him L20,000 , he " carried himself with extraordinary Grace " towards him . The Queen Mother , however , continued still in the utmost bitterness . But the ground was being cut from under her feet . The infamous Berkeley , seeing that the game was up , went to the Duke and confessed his crime , pleading as his excuse his devotion to his master , whom he had wished to save from the consequences of a ruinous marriage . The Duke was delighted , and so relieved in his curious , dark mind , that he absolutely forgave Berkeley . He visited Anne , despite his mother 's passionate protestations " that whenever that Woman should be brought into Whitehall by one Door , her Majesty would go out of it by another Door , and never come into it again . " But her displeasure could not be continued indefinitely . It was , in fact , dissipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her she would not be welcomed back in France , unless she reconciled herself to all concerned . Evelyn , on the other hand , suggests in his Diary under date October 7 , 1660 , that the reconciliation which took place later was due to the Chancellor 's offer to pay the Queen 's debts . Both versions , of I18 Anne Hyde : Early Life course , may have truth in them , but it seems more probable that the Cardinal 's intervention was the decisive factor . At any rate , by December 22 the marriage was , according to Evelyn , publicly owned , and the courtiers kissed the hand of the Duchess of York . And so the curtain was rung down on one of the strangest scenes in the drama of history . Of the figures who took the chief parts the King appears the most agreeable character , while the Duke 's conduct at the best was contemptibly weak , and at the worst wholly dishonourable . Both Pepys and Burnet pre-sent his part in a more unfavourable light even than Clarendon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October , 166o , repeats a report " . . . that for certain he did promise her ( Anne ) marriage , and had signed it with his blood , but that he by stealth had got the paper out of her cabinet . And that the King will have him marry her , but that he will not . " 22 Burnet , in a review of the whole affair from its origin , when Anne was maid of honour , says : " . . . the Duke , who was even to his old age of an amorous disposition , tried to gain her to comply with his desires . She managed the matter with so much address that in conclusion he married her . Her father did very solemnly protest , that he knew nothing of the matter till it broke out , and then the Duke ' ' 9 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries thought to have shaken her from claiming it by great promises and great threatenings . But she was a woman of a high spirit . She said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was so ; let him use her afterwards as he pleased . " 23 Against these weighty witnesses there is the Duke 's own account , which is that the King tried to dissuade him from the ceremony of marriage , as well as many of his friends and " specially some of his meniall Servants . " That he , on the contrary , continued " constant in his resolution , " and that at last the King gave way . He suggests that Clarendon circum spectly brought the King round in a matter " which seem 'd so much to his own advantage . " About his wife he ( or the writer of the Memoirs ) says : " It must be confessed , that what she wanted in birth , was so well made up by other endowments , that her carriage afterwards did not misbecome her acquired dignity . " 24 Of Lord Clarendon 's part his own account is suffi sufficiently self-revealing . Both Lord Macaulay and Clarendon 's chief biographer , Lister , regard the story of his attitude to his daughter as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary conduct , I would submit a plea , which , I think , has not so far been adequately emphasised . He lived in I20 Anne Hyde . Early Life an age when the theory of the Divine Right of Kings 25 was believed in by the representatives of seventeenth-century Toryism as a vital political commonplace . To these men monarchy was not an expediency , but a divine manifestation of government . Majesty was sacred . To the son of a Wiltshire country squire it must have seemed almost a sacrilege that his daughter should come so near the throne . Moreover , Clar endon , with a passionate devotion to the King , had endured fourteen years of exile , waiting for that great day of Restoration . He conceived it to be of para mount importance to maintain the dignity of king-ship . He was filled with astonishment when the news of his daughter 's affair with the Duke did not outrage other men 's notions , as it appears to have outraged his own . In this he was a little out of date . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had forgotten the Civil War and the Commonwealth . But in one respect he calculated rightly . He foresaw that this marriage would ultimately be the cause of his downfall , even though , at the time , much to his surprise , it merely increased his power . " This marriage , " he says , " seemed to all Men to have established his Fortune , and that of his Family : I say , to all Men but to himself , who was not the least I2I Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries Degree exalted with it . He knew well upon how slippery Ground He stood ; and how naturally averse the Nation was from approving an exorbitant Power in any Subject . " 26 I22 ANNE HYDE : DUCHESS OF YORK ( 1660-7r ) ANNE HYDE : DUCHESS OF YORK ( 166o ? 71 ) WITH the formal recognition of her marriage , Anne Hyde ? the Duchess of York , as we must henceforth call her ? takes a foremost place in that brilliant but restless circle which composed the courtly world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wiltshire fields and Mr. Henry Hyde , of Dinton ; we forget quiet Cran bourne , where Anne was born , the home of old Sir Thomas Aylesbury , Lady Clarendon 's father , that " learned man , " as Anthony a Wood calls him , " and as great a Lover and Encourager of Learning and learned men , especially of Mathematicians ( he being one himself ) , as any man in his time . " 1 We enter completely into the world . Eleven crowded years follow one another , and then , suddenly , every-thing for the Duchess ceases : she dies , and the worldly stream glides on without her . But during these years events have jostled one another into fulfilment : a never-ending succession of ducal amours , for James resembled his brother at I25 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries least in this one respect ; the great plague ; the great fire of London ; the naval war with the Dutch , in which the Duke figures and indirectly the Duchess herself ; the fall of her father , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman Catholicism , followed by that of the Duchess , an event in those days accounted an unforgivable political crime ; added to all these a great number of social festivities ; and lastly , and for the Duchess most important of all , a continuous succession of children . Hardly a year passes without the familiar entry in Pepys 's Diary , " the Duchess is brought to bed of a boy " ( or a girl ) . In these eleven years eight children are born . Of these four died during the Duchess 's lifetime , and two within nine months of her death ; two daughters only survived , to become successively queens of England . Had the Duchess lived ? she died when she was only thirty-four ? there is every reason to suppose that her family would have been very much larger . Large families were the invariable rule . On the other hand , the death-rate was terrible . An examination of sepulchral monuments , or the pedigrees recorded in old county histories sufficiently demonstrate both facts . As Dean Inge observes : 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of twenty-two children , among whom he was the only 126 Anne Hyde : Duchess of York one to grow up , remained common till the middle of the eighteenth century . Then the death-rate rapidly declined . . . . " The following list of the Duchess 's children , with the dates of birth , and of death in the case of the six who died young , is at once a witness of partial joy and of much pain and suffering , a witness it is essential to remember when we consider other aspects of the Duchess 's life . CHARLES , Duke of Cambridge , born October 22 , 1660 ; died May 5 , 1661 . JAMES , Duke of Cambridge , born July 12 , 1663 ; died June 20 , 1667 . CHARLES , Duke of Kendal , born July 4 , 1666 ; died May 22 , 1667 . EDGAR , Duke of Cambridge , born September 14 , 1667 ; died June 8 , 1671 . MARY ( afterwards Queen ) , born April 30 , 1662 . ANNE ( afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , born January 13 , 1669 ; died November 15 , 1669 . KATHERINE , born February 7 , 1671 ; died December 5 , 1671 .3 In the case of the normal family of those times , the high death-rate is sufficiently accounted for by the terrible scourge of smallpox , consumption , in-127 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries sanitary conditions and recurrent outbreaks of the plague . In this case , however , Bishop Burnet sug gests that the Duke 's disordered life may have been responsible . " Upon the whole matter the duke was often ill : the children were born with ulcers , or they broke out soon after : and all his sons died young and unhealthy . This has , as far as anything what soever that could be brought in the way of proof , prevailed to create a suspicion that so healthy a child as the pretended prince of Wales could neither be his , nor be born of any wife with whom he lived long . The violent pain that his eldest daughter had in her eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are thought the dregs of a tainted original . Upon which , Willis , the great physician , being called to consult for one of his sons , gave his opinion in these words , Mala stamina vitae ; which gave such offence that he was never called for afterwards . " 4 It is only fair to the Duke to say that this sug gestion is countered by Cockburn , who had attended his person , and by Boileau , the King 's surgeon . There can , however , be little doubt as to the number and variety of the Duke 's amours : there is a passage in his memoirs under date 1682 , in which in reference to his second wife 's devotion to him , and how cer-I28 Anne Hyde : Duchess of York tain " private grievances " were " the more insup-portable , " the writer says : " For as yet all these adversities had not washed him clean from certain personal disorders , which had all along been so grievous to her ; but she lived not much longer before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect rival of her virtue , but a most exemplar and fervent penitent for the sinns of his former life . " b And in the " Advice " which James bequeathed to his son , the Prince of Wales , known as the old Pretender , there is a pathetic and reiterated warning against " the forbidden love of Women " and " the sins of the flesh . " That the Court of the Restoration period was , in addition to its brilliance , gaiety and culture , also exceedingly licentious , no sensible person would attempt to deny . On the other hand , certain author-ities on the period have rather " torn a passion to tatters " and tended to tar all and sundry with the same brush . Thus so eminent a scholar as the Reverend A. B. Grosart goes out of his way to vindi-cate Andrew Marvell 's brutal attacks on Anne Hyde . Grosart speaks of her " notorious liaisons , " and seems to regard her as a typical profligate of the Restoration . In a really absurd sentence he refers to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad stern name be allowable ? as ever polluted the Court I29 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries of England ? the Duchess of York , daughter of the Clarendon. " s Now , Marvell , with a political and religious axe to grind , must be taken strictly " cum grano salis . " Dr. A. W. Ward in his memoir of Anne Hyde in the Dictionary of National Biography , referring to Marvell 's attacks , says : " Anne Hyde was doubtless not very different in manners and morals from her surroundings , but the charges both horrible and loathsome brought against her in Mar vell 's satires may safely be rejected . " I think Dr. Ward is perhaps over-cautious in his defence of the Duchess . How a woman who bore eight children to her husband in eleven years can possibly have been other than a very virtuous and , indeed , long-suffering wife , I can not conceive . The affair with Sydney we shall hereafter relate , and give our reasons for regarding as wholly fugitive . Marvell himself was clearly deceived by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsehood related in the first part of this essay : " Bold James survives , no dangers make him flinch : He marries seigneur Falmouth 's pregnant wench . " 7 This is a good example of how hard it is to catch up a gross lie , even though the originator has him-self repudiated it . 130 Anne Hyde : Duchess of York It may be thought by some that this reference to the ugly aspect of a bygone time is painful and unnecessary . That it is painful may be true ; that it is unnecessary I can not agree . It is the object of this essay , and of the others in this volume , to throw a little light on the actual life of particular persons in different classes of society who lived some two or three centuries ago . If the unpleasant be ignored , no complete picture can be drawn . On the other hand , the method of suggestion practised by some writers , however intriguing as a literary artifice , seems to me in a story based wholly on life , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imagination of the reader may conceive a far more unfavourable picture of the particular person than the known facts warrant ; unsatisfactory because the picture ceases to be historical and becomes blurred , patchy , or positively distorted . We return to the Duchess . As the greater part of the Duchess 's life during these eleven years , and of those with whom she was mainly concerned , was spent in London , it will be useful to recall its appearance , and that of Whitehall in particular , where there will be cause to accompany Pepys on one or two occasions . " Whoever , " says Macaulay , " examines the maps of London which were published towards the close of the reign of Charles the Second will see that only the nucleus of the present capital then existed . The 131 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries town did not , as now , fade by imperceptible degrees into the country . No long avenues of villas , embow-ered in lilacs and laburnums , extended from the great centre of wealth and civilisation almost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kent and Surrey . In the east , no part of the immense line of warehouses and artificial lakes which now stretches from the Tower to Blackwall had even been projected . On the west , scarcely one of those stately piles of building which are inhabited by the noble and wealthy were in existence , and Chelsea , which is now peopled by more than forty thousand human beings , e was a quiet country village with about a thousand inhabitants . On the north , cattle fed , and sportsmen wandered with dogs and guns , over the site of the borough of Marylebone , and over far the greater part of the space now covered by the boroughs of Finsbury and of the Tower Ham-lets . Islington was almost a solitude , and poets loved to contrast its silence and repose with the din and turmoil of the monster London . On the south the capital is now connected with its suburb by several bridges , not inferior in magnificence and solidity to the noblest works of the Cxsars . In 1685 , a single line of irregular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and garnished , after a fashion worthy of the naked barbarians of Dahomy , with scores of mouldering heads , impeded the navigation of the river . " 9 132 Anne Hyde : Duchess of York The fashionable part of London stretched from Somerset House , where the Queen-Mother lived , down the Strand to Charing Cross and Whitehall . Southampton Square ( now Bloomsbury Square ) and the district , since Monmouth 's day known as Soho , were also frequented by the great . On the other hand , Oxford Street " ran between hedges , " Regent Street was " a solitude , " and Macaulay refers to an old General Oglethorpe , who died in 178S , as boasting that he had shot woodcock there in the reign of Queen Anne . Piccadilly was almost equally rural , and Clarendon House , which Lord Clarendon built ? Worcester House , in the Strand , where he lived at first , was only leased to him by the Marquis of Worcester ? stood practically alone on part of the site now occupied by Albemarle Street . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been little , advantage in numbering them ; for of the coachmen , chairmen , porters and errand-boys of London , a very small proportion could read . It was necessary to use marks which the most ignorant could understand . The shops were , therefore , distinguished by painted or sculptured signs , which gave a gay and grotesque aspect to the streets . The walk from Charing Cross to Whitechapel lay through an endless succession of Saracens ' Heads , Royal Oaks , Blue Bears , and Golden Lambs , which disappeared when they were no longer required for the direction of the common people . " The Palace of Whitehall  --  " White Hall , " as 133 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries Pepys always calls it ? where the Duke and Duchess of York had apartments , as well as in St. James 's Palace , stretched , in Charles II 's time , from Great Scotland Yard , near Charing Cross , to Cannon Row , Westminster . From the thirteenth to the sixteenth century it had been the London house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on a grand scale , was the last Archbishop to live there . Thereafter Henry VIII had it conveyed to himself . Hitherto it had been known as York Place , but Henry changed the name to White Hall . There is a passage in Shakespeare 's Henry VIII ( Act IV , Sc . 1 ) which speaks of the change both of ownership and name . Two gentlemen are discussing Anne Bullen 's coronation , and one of them who had been in the Abbey describes the end of the ceremony : So she parted , And with the same full state pac 'd back again To York-place , where the feast is held . First Gen. Sir , You must no more call it York-place , that 's past ; For , since the Cardinal fell , that title 's lost ; ' T is now the King 's , and call 'd Whitehall . Third Gen. I know it ; But ' t is so lately altered that the old name Is fresh about me. 134 .4nne Hyde : Duchess of York In Charles II 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Within its precincts were the offices of the Treasury and of the Privy Council , the Chapel Royal , the Cockpit ( used also as a theatre ) , the apartments of eminent ministers , mistresses , and maids of honour . In Besant 's Survey the Palace is described as " a vast nest of chambers and offices , " for both the Tudor and the Stuart monarchs had greatly added to it . But though parts of it were beautiful , it does not appear to have given the impression of magnificence . On one side of the Palace was the river , on the other St. James 's Park . Bordering on the latter were the Cockpit and the Tennis Court " built by Henry VIII , now the sites of the Treasury and the Privy Council Office respectively , for the Palace was burned down in the course of two destructive fires in 1691 and 1697 . Only the Banqueting Hall and certain parts of the building now known as Treasury Chambers survive . A public road ran through the Palace precincts , connecting Charing Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memoirs of Count Gram mont , gives a charming account of the pleasantness 135 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries of the Palace from the river-side in the days of Charles II : " The river Thames washes the Skirts of the vast and unmagnificent Palace of the Kings of Great Britain , called White-Hall . ' T was from the Stairs of that Palace that the Court used to take Water , towards the close of those Summer days when Heat and Dust do not permit walking in St. James 's Park . An infinite Number of open Boats full of the celebrated Beauties of the Court and City , attended the Barges in which were the Royal Family : and Collations , Musick , and Fireworks compleated the Entertainment . The Chevalier Grammont always made one of the Company , and generally added something of his own Invention , to heighten the Diversion by some surprizing Stroke of Magnificence and Gallantry . Sometimes , he had compleat Consorts of Voices and Instruments , which he privately sent for from Paris , and which struck up , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave Banquets that likewise came from France , and which even out-did the King 's Collations in London . " On May 5 , 1661 , the infant Duke of Cambridge died , the Duchess 's first-born son who had entered the world in the extraordinary circumstances related earlier in this history . From a remark of Pepys 's in his Diary of May 6 , that he heard the Duke and his lady were " not much troubled , " it may , perhaps , be assumed that the poor child was too delicate to survive happily . But for this loss the earlier years 136 Anne Hyde : Duchess of York of the Duchess 's married life seem to have been outwardly gay enough . It is , however , impossible to suppose , despite all the Court festivity , which Pepys describes with such incomparable vividness , that her life can have been other than restless , and at times most unhappy . For the Duke , though he seems to have been really fond of his wife , was unfor tunately continually falling in love elsewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frances Stewart , Lady Southesk , Miss Arabella Churchill , for all these ladies , and others besides , that impressionable heart burned . It would be im possible within any reasonable space ' to recount the Duke 's doubtful adventures . Suffice it to say that the most serious and prolonged affair was with Miss Churchill , maid of honour to the Duchess , by whom he had four children . Miss Churchill was the sister of John Churchill , afterwards Duke of Marlborough , who probably owed his introduction to the great world to his sister . One of the four children was the celebrated Duke of Berwick , who subsequently fought on the French side against his uncle , the Duke of Marlborough , in the wars of the Spanish Succession 11 Certainly it was a strange world . As to Miss Hamilton , " la belle Hamilton , " it is impos sible to forbear recalling her brother 's witty descrip tion of the Duke 's method of courtship : 137 Gossip of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries " Hunting being his favourite Diversion , that exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he return 'd pretty much fatigued . But Miss Hamil-ton 's Presence revived him , whenever he happen 'd to find her with the Queen or Duchess . There it was that not daring to tell her what lay heavy on his Heart , he entertain 'd her with what he had in his Head : Telling her miracles of the Cunning of Foxes , and the Mettle of Horses ; making her long Details of broken Arms and Legs , dislocated Necks and Shoulders ' , with other curious and enter-taining Adventures , after which his Eyes told the rest ' till such Time as Sleep interrupted their Con-versation ; for those tender Interpreters could not help now and then composing themselves in the midst of their ogling. " 12 Needless to say , the Duke was not taken seriously by the humorous and fastidious Miss Hamilton . It will be well , with the assistance of Pepys , to watch one or two everyday Court scenes , in which the Duchess figures , before more sombre shadows cross the stage . It is Sunday , March 7 , 1662 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where by Mr. Blagrave 's means I got into his pew , and heard Dr. Creeton , the great Scotchman , preach before the King , and Duke and Dutchess , upon the words of Micah ? ' Roule yourselves in dust . ' He made a most learned sermon on the words ; but 138 Anne Hyde : Duchess of York in his application , the most comical man that ever I heard in my life . " It is not surprising that Pepys found the Scots-man comical , for he seems to have discoursed on such diverse themes as the royal ingratitude to the Cavaliers , and the desirability of cortinence during Lent . Some few months later , on September 7 , also a Sunday , Pepys had a great treat . Mr. Pierce , the chirurgeon , took him to Somerset House , , . . . and there carried me into the Queen-Mother 's presence-chamber , where she was with our own Queen sitting on her left hand ( whom I did never see before ) ; and though she be not very charming , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing . Here also I saw Madam Castlemaine and , which pleased me most , Mr. Crofts , " the King 's bastard , a most pretty spark , of about 15 years old , who , I perceive , do hang much upon my Lady Castle-maine , and is always with her ; and , I hear , the Queens both of them are mighty kind to him . By and by in comes the King , and anon the Duke and his Duchess ; so that , they being all together , was such a sight as I never could almost have happened to see with so much ease and leisure . . . . Here were great store of ladies , but very few handsome . The King and Queen were very merry ; and he 139
