In Baden-Baden , Germany , the kings gathered for their last stand . Some in black , some in white , their swart or pallid queens beside them , they saw their knights sally into the ruffle and broil of the encounter to win a momentary conquest , or to fall , dying the death that is reserved for privilege in defeat . It was a lean day that did not see a dozen monarchs overcome . Upon the neat battlefields , the gods of the nations were at war : Sir George Thomas for England , Spielmann for Austria , Rosselli for Italy , Jacques Mieses for Germany , Colle for Belgium , Alexander Alekhine for Russia , Niemzowitsch for Denmark , Richard Reti for Czecho-Slovakia , Frank J. Marshall for the U.S. and twelve more who had qualified for the International Chessmasters ' Tournament . <P> Minds battled like searchlights fencing in a night sky . Reti of Czecho-Slovakia , who can play 25 games blindfolded , made an " oversight " which cost him a game in a few moves . Marshall of the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played as if an immobile , enormous shape , looming unseen behind him , directed with Gargantuan fingers the movement of his smaller hands upon the Lilliputian kings . Once , it is true , he made a misplay , uncovered his queen . The watchers sucked in their breath . Surely now this Merlin was done for . But his opponent , Spielmann , did not see the opening ; the next move set it right . He was safe , and so he stayed until the last day . Then it was found that Marshall of the U.S. had tied for fifth place ; that a Ukranian , Boguljubow , had taken fourth , Saemisch of Germany third , Rubinstein of Poland second , and this undefeatable one , Alexander Alekhine of Russia , first . His victory makes him unquestionably the logical challenger of the world 's chess champion , Jos R. Capablanca of Cuba . <P> Seor Capablanca , secure in his title , remained far from Baden-Baden.                    @
