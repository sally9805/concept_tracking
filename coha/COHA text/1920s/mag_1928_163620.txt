Like lions in a cage , 70 airplanes made to fly were wheeled last week into Convention Hall in Detroit . In a day , 30,000 persons came to the All-American Aircraft Show to see and marvel . Some stayed to buy , for this was a business show , with salesmen talking turkey , not an exhibition of good will . <P> As always , business was stimulated by the spectacular . Spread out over the waspish little ship in which Bleriot first flew across the English Channel , stood the huge trimotored plane in which Commander Richard E. Byrd hopes to conquer the Antarctic . Opposite stood a model of the first Wright machine , in which man first made an honest flight a quarter of a century ago . <P> Beside the huge Fokker in which Byrd flew over the North Pole , the Josephine Ford , stood the yellowed Pride of Detroit , one of three trim Stinson planes , in which William Brock and Edward Schlee flew from Newfoundland to Japan , almost three-quarters of the way around the world . <P> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beauty of line , color , luxury of appointments . Wise-appearing men and smiling women climbed into the cabin of the comfortable Fairchild ship , sat in the becurtained and be-flowered parlor of the Fokker Super-universal , peeked into the baggageroom and the lavatory boasted by the Loening Amphibian . Army and Navy officers inspected the two Corsairs done in navy blue and silver by Chance Vought . Mail pilots peeked at the streamlined Bellanca , made for speed flying . Collegians assembled about the first plane built with a rumble seat . . . . <P> Designers and builders trod on each other 's toes : Anthony H. G. Fokker , Sherman M. Fairchild , B. F. Mahoney , Igor Sikorsky . The operators of 15 air lines met and discussed business . All were out for business , the Pioneer Instrument Company even sending along a " Flying Showcase . " <P> Public interest exceeded the most optimistic hopes . Long before 10 o'clock , when the doors were opened , there were lines waiting to get in . The giant Sikorsky , moored off the Detroit Yacht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall , was constantly surrounded . Most amazing of all , men and women seemed to understand and a few got out their checkbooks.
