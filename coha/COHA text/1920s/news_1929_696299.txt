txt New York Central Lines has placed an order with the American Locomotive Co. for 150 ingines involving an expenditure of approximately $14,000.000 . Order comprises 75 latest Hudpon type passenger locomotives - and 75 heavy Mohawk freight engines . This order . with the 100 Mohawk engines ordered from American earlier in the year costing about $8.500.000. now in course of delivery to New York Central Lines , is understood to be the largest order in money for engines placed by any carrier in a single year . Placing of the New York Central contract increases the unfilled orders of the locomotive company materially , and makes certain excellent harnings in the current year . It has been estimated in the past that approximately $30 , - 000,000 of new business , in addition to a normal amount of repair work , is required to cover the full year 's $8 a share annual dividend on . American Locomotive common . If this is correct the Central order of 514,000,000 means approxi-j mately $3 to $3.50 a share for the junior issue . i Unfilled orderr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood of $50 , - 000,000. or sufficient to cover the common dividend this year with a big margin to spare . There are more orders awaited in the coming months , so that it is reasonable to expect the company will ? ... rn more than twice its dividend requirements this year . This would compare with $1.92 a share on the 770,000 shares of no- , par common stock outstanding in 1928 . There was considerable surprise when it was announced that the Central order amounted to 150 locomotives , because the inquiry was said to have called for only 50 engines . Present condition of the American Locomotive Co. is in sharp contrast with a year ago . When there was a spurt in buying late in 1927 some hope was held out that 1928 would be a good year . but the demand petered out and earnings were disappointing . Naturally when hopes were expressed late last year and early in the current year that engine buying would be on a large scale many believed the experiences of the preceding year would be repeated Officials of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been at any time in several years . With record earnings assured and some business still in sight the management 's enthusiasm is juntifled . The decided turn has come after several years of unusualy leith business and is therefore more important in the affairs of the company than many outsiders realize . Some interests are now insisting that estimates made early this year of the possibility of earnings of as much as $20 a share on American Locomotive may actually be realized .
