CORRESPONDENCE In Defence of Mr. Wilson SIR : In your article , The Obstacle to Peace in Europe , you make the Treaty of Versailles the obstacle and proceed : " It was fortunate for the American people that the Senate did not ratify it . The refusal was not the ignoble and cowardly repudiation which Mr. Wilson makes it out to be . He himself rendered inevitable the ultimate resumption by the United States of freedom of action by associating American responsibility to Europe with the enforcement of a Treaty which consecrated more completely than ever before the reign of force in European politics . The Treaty gave to France the opportunity of destroying Germany by due process of law . " The truth is that the Senate opposed , not the harsh features of the Treaty , but the beneficent League of Nations Covenant . If Messrs . Lodge , Knox et al could have detached the League , they would have accepted the Treaty . The ignoble and cowardly deed was the repudiation of the League . The consequent weakening of the League manifestly made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson , you will remember , saw so little hope of accomplishing his ends at Versailles that he once ordered the George Washington to be in readiness to take him home . To persist or not to persist was a harder problem than Hamlet 's " to be or not to be . " Mr. Wilson persisted ; he attained some of his objects , the most notable and essential being the League of Nations . " We have killed Mr. Wilson 's League , " declared Senator Lodge triumphantly at the Republican National Convention in xgzo . And yet you blame Mr. Wilson and have blamed him since 5958 and now declare , in strange company with the selfish isolationists , that the action of the Senate was fortunate and was not ignoble or cowardly . Finally , are you right in asserting that France is destroying Germany " by due process of law " ? The best jurists in England and America deny this and agree with Mr. Wilson that France has scrapped the Treaty . In all this , are you fair to a man , who deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice and mercy might prevail ? jOHN P. MOORS . THE NEW attraction was that it combined the usual classical curriculum with a thoroughly efficient and well-equipped department of Applied Science and Engineering ; while its great aim ? unique in the English educational system ? was to find out what each by could do best , and then develop that special aptitude as far as the facilities of the School would permit . . . . If Mr. Bain is seeking for Sanderson and Oundle in fiction , he should read Mr. Wells 's novel , Joan and Peter . In the story , as I recall it , the guardian of Peter , searching for a suitable school for the boy , discovers Oundle and its great Headmaster ? both thinly disguised under fictitious names , but readily recognizable by all friends of the school . . . . F. L. BOSQUI . New York City . The Height of College Women S IR : In your comment on my paper , Some of the Causal Factors in the Increased Height of College Women reprinted from the Journal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you raised an interesting question . Observations made during the past two years may be of interest in relation to the height of daughters and their parents . Among 53o college women who entered Stanford University during the past five quarters , fifty-eight percent were taller than their mothers , fifteen percent were the same height and only twenty-seven percent were shorter . Among 519 women whose height was compared to the height of their fathers , seven percent were taller , seven percent were the same height and eighty-six percent were shorter . This does not represent the full story , however , for the traditional view that a woman must be shorter tends to minimize the number who report that they equal their fathers in height . Moreover , the dignity and im , portance of the head of the house is apt to convey an idea of large size whether it exists or not when the question of relative heights has never been considered before this question is raised . Six percent were taller than both parents . We must remember also that the majority of these college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably more , in some cases several inches , in the next few years . Although the numbers are too small to be conclusive , does it not tend to cast doubt on the suggestion that the increased height of the modern college woman is due to the fact that they are the daughters Of a very highly selected stock of successful men who are taller ? CLELIA D. MOSHER , M. D. Stanford University , California . Not necessarily . We argued that in the last generation tall men were more likely to be successful than others and therefore more likely to send their daughters to college . We did not assume that these tall men would have married tall women . If they married women of average height , the daughters would on the average be taller than their mothers , exactly the fact as Dr. Mosher finds it. ? Tmt EDITORS . Freud and Behaviorism S J. B. Watson begins his review of Jung 's book on psychological types rather characteristie.ally , with some contemptuous remarks about psycho7analysis and psycho-analysts . He compares favorably a newer group who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older men who are " magicians . " He also tells us that " when the smoke of mystery had been cleared away it was found that most of the new prin ciples were not so new after all . " I am quite at a loss to understand what all this vacuous affirmation is good for Freud is , I suppose , as old an analyst as any Is he too a magician ? Were his " principles " ? whatever that may , mean ? not new in the nineties when he announced them , or were they not new when Watson and other psycho ! - ogists began to concern themselves with the matter long after ? Freud 's essential work was done before that of Thorndyke or Jennings , and before any of the characteristic modern developments of instinct studies . Behaviorism was still in the womb if , indeed , it had gotten so far . The only psychology then existing with usable categories was the old one which Watson and others do not find serviceable even for ordinary laboratory purposes . // In t00% reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lower Organisms led me to a rather thorough-going behaviorism . That winter I first heard of Freud and read some of his books . He seemed to me to be thoroughly behavioristic , and I still think him far and away the most im portant of the behaviorists . Of course I do not identify be " haviorism and Watsonism. / It is unfortunate that Freud was driven to rather cumbrous formulations , but it must be borne in mind that he was beginning at the complicated end . He was not , like the laboratory psychologists , picking problems that could , be reduced to their simplest terms , but then he was laboring at his vocation which meant a dwelling in the thickest mess of circumstance . Watson 's occasional reviews in the New . Republic remind me strongly of reviews that I see from time to time in the psychoanalytic journals . These too have a tendency to measure the aberrations of others by simply stating their divergence from what the reviewer thinks acceptable . The method is neat in its simplicity , but appeals to only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Christmas in Germany S IR : Before the postage becomes dearer ? today a letter to 0 America casts zoo , 000,000 marks , on Monday 4,000,000,000 shall seize the occasion to write you once more . The agony of our poor country becomes more and more evident , we all fear that we stand before great disastrous events for life is no longer to be borne .

HANS HALLE . Berlin , Germany . Translations of the New Testament IR : The review of Goodspeed 's The New Testament , an LP American Translation , by P. L. , in the New Republic of November 28 , is singularly irritating to read . The naive assuMPtions of this reviewer , coupled with his apparent ignorance of earlier modern-speech translations of the New Testament , combine to make his review at once an over-laudation and an a " pression , of contempt for Professor Goodspeed 's work . Your reviewer , assuming that it is " uneducated " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obstacle , and that there is a genuine " seventeenth-century music " in the words of that version , goes far astray . From the point of view of one acquainted with contemporary English as it is written by these who write it well , the language of the older version of the NO , Testament is gross and crude , not to say ungrammatical and unrhetorical . The structure of the older versions is such as We hardly expect even an eighth-grade child to perpetrate today : a string of " taggy " sentences , connected with Pond 's " in tI undue profusion . Our familiarity has made us believe that there is any music in the language of the authorized version ? exactly , familiarity has made us accept excessively syncopated jazz in recent years . Professor Goodspeed 's translation is far from being the first modern-speech version . One of the finest was produced'some twenty years ago by a group of scholars , under the title The Twentieth Century New Testament . Shortly after that , Weymouth 's version , preferred by many , appeared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , followed soon afterWards . What the Goodspeed translation does is at best to gild the fine gold of good English of the Twentieth Century and Weymouth versions . For my own part , I find the " glimpses of paintings " and all the other poetic associations in the modern-speech versions rather than in the irritatingly childish crudeness of the Authorized Version . STEPHEN G. RICH . Essex Fells , New Jersey . Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Flexner S IR : Lloyd George , during his recent visit to America , told an interviewer that he had been reading about Theodore Roosevelt . " The best thing he ever said , " continued the little Welsh giant , " was ' Every time I say thou shalt not steal , there 's a panic in Wall Street . ' That is what you would call a great line .

" EZRA BOWEL Lafayette College . From the Michigan Public 1 Utilities Commission Q IR : My attention has just been called to an article appear- 1/40 ing on page 215 of your edition of October 24 , 5923 , in which you make reference to a letter written by me , as member of the Michigan Public Utilities Commission , to the Department Commander of the United Spanish War Veterans , at Detroit , Michigan . I feel that you have done me an injustice in this article about this matter , and for that reason I want to give You full information . On July 10 , 1923 , I received a letter from Mr. Thomas J. Barrett , Department Commander , of the United Spanish War Veterans , Detroit , Michigan , advising that there was a feeling on the part of an officer of one of Detroit 's public utilities , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War Veterans ' Association , he was fearful that this Commission would object to it . There was nothing to indicate that the money was to be used for any purpose except the legitimate expenses of the Association . On July 12 , I answered this letter , and , in addition to the quotation you give which is made up of two sentences taken frorn different parts of the letter , I said , " In the first place this Commission has no authority to say whether a public utility shall contribute funds for your cause or any other . " After reading the article in the New Republic , I wrote a letter to Mr. Barrett , a copy of which I enclose . MICHIGAN PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION SHERMAN T. HANDY , Commissioner . Enclosure Mr. Thomas J. Barrett , Commander , Department of Michigan U. S. W. V. 5105 Woodward Ave. , Detroit , Michigan . Dear Sir : My attention has been called to the fact that you are using rilY letter of July X2 , in answer to your letter of July so , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit and elsewhere , for the purpose of combatting radicalism I have just examined your letter of July ro , and my answer thereto , and I can not find anything in my letter which would or could be used to assist you in any way in raising money for 511Y purpose except to aid the veterans of the Spanish American War . That there may be no misunderstanding , let me say that technically a utility has no right to use money collected by it from its patrons for donations of any kind , but this Commission has never raised any objection to utilities making appropriations for patriotic purposes . There should be no dispute as to what is meant by " patriotic " purposes . Donations by utility corporations for political , religious , fraternal or social organizations , are not included in the class heretofore mentioned . It would not be fair for a utility to use funds collected from its patrons , for the benefit of some of them and to the detriment of others . This would surely result in case utilities were to contribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , , a utility corporation , if it wants to contribute to any of the latter classes , should contribute out of the funds available for return , and not charge the same to operating expenses . I hope I have made myself clear in this matter . Very truly yours , MICHIGAN PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ( Signed ) SHERMAN T. HANDY , Commissio er . ? Matter enough ! " S I : Under the above title , Professor C. E. Ayres reviews in your issue of August 29 my book , entitled Matter , Life , Mind , and God ( New York , Harcourt , Brace and Company ) . Mr. Ayres pays me the compliment of saying that " as a statement the book is intelligible to the point of transparency . " How I wish this were true . For , to judge by Mr. Ayres 's review , I have failed to make my argument transparent to him . May I have another try ? r . The purpose of my book , according to Mr. Ayres , is " to show that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ? tare essentially the same thing . " On the contrary , the purpose of my book is to insist that phenomena are qualitatively distinct , and that all attempts to identify them , e. g. by reducing the phenomena of mind and life to " nothing but physico-chemical processes , " are in principle mistaken . I plead for the " autonomy " of biology and psychology , as against physics and chemistry . They have their own qualitatively distinct subject matter and must deal with it by their own irreducible concepts and laws . And , in an intellectual universe thus differentiated , there is room , I hold , for religion , too . I do not say , as Mr. Ayres asserts that I do , that there is an " essential identity " between science and religion . On the contrary , I say that they are different , but not mutually incompatible . 2 . Mr. Ayres twice uses phrases calculated to suggest that I am using that " Majestic Compromise , " the " anaemic Absolute . " Not guilty , my Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my book where I use the concept of the Absolute as a part ' of my synoptic argument . I am almost tempted to think that Mr. Ayres is criticizing , not the book I have written , but the book which , a priori , he thinks I ought to have written . 3 . This suspicion is confirmed by the fact that Mr. Ayres credits me with discussing several other topics which I do not so much as mention . According to my showing , he says , " science is revealing the ultimate nature of substance ( sub-atomic physics ) , the metaphysical identity of space and time ( relatively ) , the ineffable wisdom of the design of the universe ( physical chemistry ) . ? . " No , Sir , I do not deal with sub atomic physics : I deal with A. N. Whitehead 's theory of Nature as " what we perceive by the senses . " I never mention relativity : I am not enough of a physicist or mathematician to have any right to do so . I say nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contention of J. L. Henderson , a distinguished bio-chemist , that the dropping of the old physico-the ? logical argument from design still leaves the facts standing to which that argument had appealed , and that for these facts a scientific explanation must be sought .
