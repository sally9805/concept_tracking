As it must to all men , Death came last week to Richard Felton Outcault , 65 , who caused the phrase , " yellow journalism , " and had a good time doing it . <P> In 1895 , having been graduated from the University of Cincinnati and having done some trifling landscapes for the office safes of nature-loving Cincinnati businessmen , young Outcault walked into the office of Joseph Pulitzer 's New York World . He had some cartoons of life in a place called Hogan 's Alley , of which the hero was a one-toothed , big-eared urchin . He thought it would be a good idea for the World to run his cartoons in color . The World thought so too . The urchin of Hogan 's Alley appeared in a yellow nightgown . Thus was born the first colored comic strip in the U. S. <P> William Randolph Hearst of the Journal lured Outcault and his Yellow Kid away from the World along with most of the World 's Sunday staff . The World countered with another Yellow Kid series . Serious-minded people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out against the " yellow journalism " of both Hearst and Pulitzer. * But Outcault was enjoying himself and his Yellow Kid was shouting : " I wish dat dese lovely wimmin wud leave me alone . " He was supposed to have founded these comics on a group of street imps who were burlesquing the Duke of Marlborough 's wedding . <P> Later , Outcault went to the Herald where he created , in 1902 , a little devil in pretty clothes-famed Buster Brown . If children cried for Castoria in those days , they kicked papain the shins for Buster Brown and his sweetheart , Mary Jane , and his dog , Tige . <P> The idea of Tige trying to chew one of Buster 's stockings was used by a manufacturer of hosiery to show how tough his product was . Other Busters were proud to wear these stockings because they felt that Brown was " a great guy . " <P> Outcault drew his last Buster Brown ten years ago , but the boy lived in the syndicates until 1921 . <P> The last years of Outcault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an advertising business , to practical jokes ( he played a piano at 5 a. m. in a Flushing , L. I. , house which people thought haunted ) . <P> It was in Flushing that his body was , last week , cremated . <P> <P> *The phrase was first applied by the late Ervin Wardman , then publisher of the New York Herald .
