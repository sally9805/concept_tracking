txt Father Francis P. Duffy , chaplain of the Sixty-ninth , who temporarily quelled interruptions during Sir Philip Gibbs 's lecture in Carnegie Hall two weeks ago , himself was uninterrupted when he re , plied to Sir Philip at the Selwyn Theatre last night . The meeting , was probably the most orderly Irish gathering held in this city since 1914 , so much so that even the names of Lloyd George and Sir Hamar Greenwood were not hissed or booed at any point in the lecture . At the outset Father Duffy told his audience that Sir Philip Gibbs was a personal friend of his , that he greatly admired the English writer and war correspondent and that their differences were differences of opinion . He objected , too , he said , to hissing audiences . He did not want his audience to hiss the name of anybody he might mention in the course of his talk . Father Duffy said he had written to Sir Philip Gibbs regarding the lecture he would give . " And I told him not to be too gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few bolts at him . Sir Philip Gibbs is a friend of mine . I admire him very much ' for his personal qualities and for his work . " About 1,500 persons were turned away from the Selwyn Theatre . Those who got in were plainly in sympathy ? with the speaker , and they greeted each point in the development of his exposition of English failure in Ireland with applause , but at no time did they cheer . " My personal idea of well ordered . liberty is most admirably and succinctly indicated by the taunting imperative of childhood days ? ' Go and hire a hall . ' It contains in brief all of my ideas about free speech , " Father Duffy began . " If a . man or a party risks his money to put over their cause of principle it is an indication that they are willing to make a sacrifice for it and also that they - have confidence that people will come to their meeting. ? Next , it takes I them out of the street and saves them from becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a safeguard against intrusion from others . If a man hires a hall he has a right to the hall . He pays money for a platform . It is his platform . " And if other people.do not like what he says they can do one of two things ? either prove in the court that his language was criminal or go and hire a hall for themselves . When I make that last remark it goes all the way ? across the board , from silly girls to solemn newspaper editors . " After this Father Duffy launched into the subject matter of his lecture . Most of those in the audience were women . Five other priests sat behind him on the platform . " Nearly two years before I was mustered out of the army a British agent approached me and asked me not to interest myself in the cause of Ireland , " Father Duffy said . " He told me that Lord Reading , who had recently departed from our shores , had confided to him evidence of a combination of political forces which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ireland within three months ' time . My answer was that that sort of thing simply did n't happen in Irish history and that I could not see any prospect that the Irish would- get anything without fighting for it . The three months have extended to two years and now Sir Philip Gibbs comes along with his blandishments , and Irish sympathizers are once more told to shut their eyes and see what Brittania will bring them . " Persons who think the Irish are taking an unreasonable stand are not acquainted with the history of Irish affairs in their own generation , Father Duffy added . The trouble , he said was that they were disillusioned Liberals , " All the pleasant optimistic things that Sir Philip Gibbs is telling us about the prospect of a settlement of the Irish question by constitutional means , we Irish sympathizers preached for forty years .. Lord , what fools we were l Now the greatest harm Sir Philip Gibbs can do to the Irish cause is to persuade the American public that his lovely liberalism represents the English attitude toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can promise the Irish . " The Irish know perfectly well with whom they have to deal in this matter ? and he is neither King nor baronet , but a mighty tough little commoner , Mr. David Lloyd George .. Read the papers day by day and you will find me indication on the Government side in England to make any change in the Irish policies . ' Not even a truce with the fighting rebels , ' says the Premier , ? and Greenwood is to stick on the jou anti carry out his policy of Schrecklichkeit . The Ulster Parliament is to be constituted , the first dismemberment Ireland has had to suffer In her many martyrdoms . There is not much ' room for political Pollannism when that little Welshman starts in to finish up the job of Oliver Cromwell and William of Orange . " It does not matter so much that the American public should be led into an attitude of too much optimism and cornfertableness about the Irish prospects . But it would be a terrible thing if the Irish people were once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceived . There is still in existence the remnant of the Irish Constitutional Party  --  the Nationalists  --  their leaders are good Irishmen and very able men . One of them . John Dillon . who has taken part in every phase of the Irish question . said recently that the time was not ripe for launching a fresh constitutional movement . as it will only be taken as an attack on Sinn Fein and a support of the savage warfare now being waged against it . " Father Duffy said lie thought the time would come when a discontented Ireland would be a breeding place of trouble between Great Britain and ? the United States . But Ireland has few friends in this country among those who made peace or war , he added . But if there came a clash of great political or economic interests between the two countries , he said , " some string would be pulled and our big agencies which control public opinion would begin to harp on British denial of liberty to Ireland in exactly the same way that the English writers used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belgium in our own times , as a means of provoking resentment against Germany . At such atime the existence of a disturbed Ireland would be a real danger to peace and a difficulty in the way of peaceful men who want to keep the two countries from war . " . " I do n't want war with England , " he said . " I often feel that those who want war have never seen it . " He then drew a picture for his audience of the sinking near each other of two ships , one British and one American with all on board , as typical of the horror of such a war . He closed by asking himself a question often raised as to the Irish issue ? the matter of religious differences in Ireland . He disposed of this by saying that no real religious differences existed , that most of the Irish leaders had been Protestants and that he hoped to see the first Irish Republican Parliament opened by " a Catholic BishoPi : Protestant Bishop , a Presbyterian : diviaie and the leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
