Storms are first forecast by those who fear them most . Storms in human affairs are often precipitated by sheer nervousness . <P> At the Democratic convention , where the present tension about Prohibition began to become national , the Drys were so much in the majority that there never was any serious likelihood of the party adopting a Wet plank . The law-enforcement plank that was adopted omitted a declaration against modification of the Prohibition laws for two reasons : <P> 1 ) The nominee upon whom the party had decided was everywhere known to favor modification . To pledge the party against modification would have created an absurd impasse . <P> 2 ) The nominee 's reiteration of his pledge to enforce the law if elected could only be accepted , by Democrats , as the word of an honest man . His reiteration of his disbelief in the present form of Prohibition was neither startling nor offensive to sincere Prohibitionists in the party . They had known his position . They honored his candor . They doubted his power to change the law . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination . Josephus Daniels said : " The primary duty of Democrats in the South and other sections is to stand by the ship and concentrate every effort in securing the election of a Democratic Senate and House which will give hearty support to Smith in every measure of reform in which we stand together . . . . But they should stand in Congress like a stone wall against any recommendation that Smith as President should make to modify the Prohibition enforcement act . . . . " <P> Senator Carter Glass of Virginia and Governor Dan Moody of Texas refused to bolt the party because of what the nomi nee had said . Their attitude was , in effect : " We need and want Smith for many reasons . We can keep him in hand on this Prohibition matter , which is only one of many matters to be considered by the Democracy . " <P> Thus far it was an issue within a party , and Nominee Smith did not hasten to force it further . He postponed his answer to Mr. Daniels until next month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarums and Prohibition ceased to be a problem peculiar to the Democratic Party . <P> Secretary Ernest H. Cherrington of the World League Against Alcoholism cried out : " The gage has been thrown in what promises to be the greatest ' wet and dry ' battle that the nation has ever seen . " <P> David Leigh Colvin , national chairman of the Prohibition Party , thought the situation looked so serious that he turned reproachfully upon Prohibition 's greatest promoter , the Anti-Saloon League , and flayed it as follows : " The Anti-Saloon League is not a party , and it is not even a league . It is merely a group of paid superintendents . The Anti-Saloon League has engaged in a number of shady political deals which have discredited it . " Mr. Colvin , who was in Chicago arranging for the Prohibition Party 's annual convention there this week , said that the Prohibition plan this year would be to back a Dry Democrat who might hamper Smith 's progress in one or more States in the Solid South .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
