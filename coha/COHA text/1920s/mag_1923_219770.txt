The Far East has called another Italian opera company to Tokyo . At the performance all the Italians in Tokyo , seven in number , were present ; but the theatre was full , the Princess Royal being present as well as a full quota of enthusiastic Japanese . American baseball teams , California University and Indiana University for example , have visited the Far East . Perhaps in the future native American opera companies will follow .
