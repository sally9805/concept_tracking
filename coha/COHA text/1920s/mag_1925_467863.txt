were living in Washington , on I Street , when father was nomiated and elected eighteenth President f the United States . He was then trty-seven years of age , the youngest tan to hold that office . Of the campaign before that election recall but one circumstance . I accomanied father upon a brief tour through few York State . At Utica we met loratio Seymour , father 's political oponent . To my amazement father took hands with him . I stood watchig , round-eyed in fascinated horror . I o not recall that anyone had ever token to or before me of Horatio eymour . My impressions of him had een formed by the cartoons of a fiercely artisan press . I believed him to be a : terrible man . And through the consteration that held me in mingled terror ad perplexity there filtered the first ords of Mr. Seymour 's greeting ords which but added to my bewilder-tent : " I fear you will have slight cause to member me as your political opponent , eneral , but I am very glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing further of that tour , of even of the stop at Utica . Of father 's first inauguration my iemory holds but one incident ? that a Lan of very considerable weight stepped pon my foot . I remember the exact lace , too ; the northwest corner of ennsylvania Avenue and Seventeenth treet . I am certain that I could put ty foot now , fifty-four years after that event , on the same spot and in the same position . It is now a larger foot . All my life I had been accustomed to frequent movings , and the habit ? if it is a habit still clings to me . I have never yet lived in any other home as long as I lived in the White House . But while I have no recollection of the actual moving from I Street to the White House , I remember that I was very unfavorably impressed by the dingy , shabby furniture and carpets in this new home . There has been little change in the interior arrangement of the White House since then . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the remodeling of a very ugly staircase mounting from the west end of the main hall ? the only way for the family to the back living rooms . The President 's offices then occupied about one-third of the second floor over the East Room . For several years my own room was on the northwest corner , but later I transferred to the room across the hall on the southwest corner . I was seldom in either except to sleep . My days were filled with outside interests and my evenings spent in the library with father and mother . The small boy has no perspective . The things of his immediate concern fill his life and are momentous or trivial in the degree that they interest him . Of the undercurrents moving about me , as of the matters of greatest public interest , I grew to understanding only with advancing years . The earlier years of my life in the White House were to me , then , not eventful . I attended school but not with great regularity . I gathered around me a new company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we became great friends . The White House lot was our playground in good weather and the big airy basement , or ground floor , was reserved for rain and storm . I never considered that my position as my father 's son entitled me to any special consideration , and I know that no playmate ever accorded me deference because of that fact . They flocked to the White House because there was the largest and best playground available . And mine was the life of an ordinary freckled-faced small boy in good health and fine spirits , who adored his father and mother , his two brothers and sister , and was in turn much loved and petted by them . Willoughby Cole , whose father was Senator from California , became my dearest churn . He lived near us on I Street and later the family moved to a home not far from the White House . Later still we were roommates at Cornell University and we kept up our brotherly intimacy to the day of his death , several years ago . I have never known a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have an off day . I saw his father , ex-Senator Cole , when he came East last year : a fine looking man one hundred years of age ? hale and hearty , too . Again , as at Vicksburg and City Point , the Army had been " father 's army , " the White House was now " father 's house . " This acceptance helped to complete my abstraction in my own affairs . The constant stir , the coming and going of all sorts of people , the frequent pageantry of formal and semi-formal gatherings were but life as I had always known it and of little concern to me compared with my personal interests . There were delightfully odd characters among the old White House employees . I often think of one old colored man whose name I have forgotten but whose Sabbath personality will never fade iron my memory . By title he was the Fur nace Man . I saw him first one Sabbatl day in the White House library , attend ing to the open coal fires , and for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sabbath . Several times eac Sunday in the early fall before the fur nace was started , throughout the winter and in the raw days of early spring 11 would come to the library , always dresse , in a double-breasted frock coat throw open to display a massive gold ? or gil ? watch chain , and carrying a shin : plug hat and a gold-headed cane . 0 week days the Furnace Man was in distinguishable , but on Sunday he wa a personage . And there was another ? Albert , ou coachman . Albert was not of the estab lished White House retinue , for w brought him with us . The White bons stables were not as large as those on Street but Albert was just as busy keen ing them perfectly clean . He appal ently never left them . If anythin could have made Albert unhappy imagine it would have been a day awa. from his horses . I do not recall that h. suffered such an affliction during th ten years he remained with us , and AI bert was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was please , with everything , including himself . Fa ther had bought from Brewster a grea heavy carriage , and the event of th day for Albert was when lie reined u his four-in-hand with it in front of th White House . The four wonderfu horses dancing and chafing at their bits the gleaming harness , the great polishe , carriage , and Albert his white teet glistening through the smile that all hi struggle for dignity could not ' mills from his ebony face ? made a pictur which held every eye . And in some mys terious way Albert could stop the prune ing and fretting of his horses at will The moment mother appeared the danc ing four would stand like statues . At the end of father 's second term a President mother sent for Albert . " I have recommended you to Mr. ayes as an excellent coachman , Albert , ad he wants you to remain with him , " le said . " I want to tell you this be-ruse I have often scolded you . " " La ! Mis ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yo ' scoldin 's iey jes ' went in one yeah an ' come out other . " " You rascal ! " said mother . Many years later I last saw Albert . " is wool had turned to cotton then , but me had not withered the smile on his rinkled black face . " Sho , Misto Jesse , Mis ' Grant cerdilly did like me as a driver , " he said roudly . " Why , th ' las ' word she said ) me was , ' Yo ' rascal ! ' " And Albert ughed at the memory even as the tears to down his black face . The first four years I knew Albert he had my unbounded admiration , and ever since he has commanded my unbounded respect . What is finer than a faithful , competent , contented man ? It was in the early days at the White House that the only sorrow I ever knew there came to me . I possessed all the normal small boy 's fondness for a dog and acquired several in rapid succession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demise my grief was bitter . Then some one presented me with a magnificent Newfoundland . When this dog came father called up the White House steward . lie asked no questions , made no accusation . " Jesse has a new dog , " he said simply . " You may have noticed that his former pets have been peculiarly unfortunate . When this dog dies every employee in the White House will at once be discharged . " " Faithful " was the name I gave this dog and he , with one or two more I acquired later , lived during the remainder of our stay in the White House . Faithful never had a press notice ; to the outside world he was no better known than was John Smith 's dog , but he lacked no attention . I have never owned a dog more deserving . Other than dogs I had few pets in the White House . At one time I was filled with the desire to keep pigeons , but it appeared that at an earlier time Tad Lincoln had been fired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other public buildings were still striving to exterminate the hardy survivors of Tad 's breeding . For me pigeons were taboo . But I still had my pony , Rebbie , only now I was outgrowing him and he was loaned to a succession of smaller boys until , his work done , he was retired to end his days in idle comfort . The steward , to whom father spoke in reference to my dogs , was the source of much mingled vexation and amusement to mother . He did not remain long in that position and I do not remember that I came into close contact with him , but for years afterward his eccentricities and self-satisfied gaucheries were recalled with amusement . He was a worthy man ? to this undeniable fact he owed his appointment . During the war he had been an excellent Quartermaster Sergeant , and father argued from this that he would mak a desirable steward . For a Iong tim father supported his choice staunchly I recall one conversation between fathe and mother apropos of some delin quency of the steward . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would hay been so much better , " said mother . " But , Julia , " smiled father , " if b were as wise as that he would not he , steward . You mus not expect a Rosco Conkling in tha position . " To the ex-ser geant th e Whi t House table was . sort of super-mess His idea of qualit , found expression i quantity . To hir the pPee de resin ance of a dinner wa : necessarily , eithe roast beef or a tui key , and improvc merit upon th i could be effected i but one way ? b a larger roast or bigger bird . Whe the wearisom sameness of hi cuisine arouse mother to prote : he would respon cheerfully in increased quantity . Then one day mother insisted Hu the table must be improved . " Improved , Madam ! " exclaimed th ex-sergeant . " Why , we have bee living on the pinnacle ! " Shortly after that father found ar other position for the ex-sergeant . But although my pets were compare tively few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early days ( my life in the White House that I la+ came interested in stamp collectim Boys never change . I am convince that the first cave boy was a collecto ' he mania for stamp collecting came pon me with the thrill of a great disavery and for a time it held me in a rvor of enthusiasm that overshadowed very other interest . No one had ever nagined such a stamp collection as I ' ould gather ! Then I came upon the advertisement f one Anthony J. Foster , of Milk treet , Boston , Massachusetts . This dvertisement offered a large assort-lent of foreign tamps for five dollars . I had e v er possessed ive dollars at one ime , and to me it as a vast sum . t did not occur to ne that there was . ny possibility of . equiring such vealth except by aving it . So I aid nothing of my Lmbition to any ) ne , save to a : cousin of my own Lge . He and I at ) nce decided that , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were possessed if the pr ice of : hat assortment of ; tamps . And at last , at : he cost of much ; elf-denial and after an interminable time , the five dollars was amassed and on its way to Boston . Then , with impatience that reckoned not of distance or train schedules , I looked for the arrival of the stamps , and in my anxiety and fear I consulted my staunch friend Kelly . Kelly was a big-bodied and bigger-hearted member of the Washington police force , detailed on special duty at the White House . In my eyes Kelly , next to my father , was the greatest man in Washington . Vox .. CL.  - -  No. 897. - 22 " Sure , ye better tell your father about it , Jesse , " was Kelly 's advice . And so I took my trouble to father . " What do you wish me to do , my dear boy ? " asked father , displaying nothing but sympathetic interest . I had been thinking about this too . " I thought you might have the Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelly write a letter , " I suggested . " Hum-m , " mused father . " A matter of this importance requires consideration . Suppose you come to the Cabinet Meeting to-morrow and we will take the matter up there . " Promptly on the hour I presented myself at the Cabinet Meeting . Hamilton Fish of New York was then Secretary of State , and William W. Belknap of Kentucky , Secretary of War ? both great friends of mine . " Jesse has a matter he wishes to bring before you , gentlemen , " said father . Breathlessly I told my story , ending with the suggestion that either the Secretary of State , the Secretary of War , or Kelly write a letter . " This is plainly a matter for the State Department to attend to , " said Mr. Fish . To this Mr. Belknap promptly took exception , declaring it his intention , as head of the War Department , to act at once . There followed a general debate in which the other Cabinet members stood solidly for Kelly . I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Kelly 's virtues , his power , and influence were extolled . He was declared to have wider powers than the Constitution bestowed upon either the Department of State or of War , and his personal ability and influence were proclaimed to be greater than that of the Secretaries who sought to usurp his prerogatives . Then the question was put to vote . Mr. Fish and Mr. Belknap voted for their respective Departments but the rest of the Cabinet voted for Kelly . Then the decision was formally announced and I went downstairs to find Kelly . I can see Kelly now as he sat doubled over at a small desk , writing that letter on the stationery of the Executive Mansion ? so headed at that time ? the sweat standing out on his forehead , his great fingers gripping the pen . At father 's suggestion I made a copy before mailing the original letter . It read : I am a Capitol policeman . I can arrest anybody , anywhere , at any time , for anything . I want you to send those stamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Capitol Policeman . A. dozen times the following day I was about making anxious inquiry for the reply to Kelly 's letter . In due time the stamps arrived . As I remember , that five-dollar assortment exceeded our expectations . For a considerable time after its arrival my cousin and I were philatelists to the exclusion of all else . One of us conceived the idea of writing to the American Consuls for specimens of the stamps of the country to which they were accredited . These requests often fell on fertile ground and many Consuls were kind enough to send us full sets . But my joy in these receipts was considerably dampened by mother 's insistence upon my writing a personal letter of thanks to all who responded . I think the drudgery of compliance with this re quirement had considerable to do wit my subsequent loss of interest . Or pe haps the disease ran its course . Certai it is that we lost interest and the collo tion was forgotten . I suppose it is no among the books in the White How library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war until his cleat When we were in the White House th dear old gentleman was still a staunc Jacksonian Democrat and would broo no argument upon politics , or , for tha matter , upon any other subject . H pronouncements were not debatabl , He and father were devoted to cac other , and I am sure father never or posed or sought to convince him , laro ever widely at variance their view : Grandfather Dent was wont to explah in strict confidence , " The General i really a staunch Democrat , but h does n't know it . " Grandfather Dent held a daily recet. tion in one of the rooms of the offic portion of the White House , and all th prominent people of the day who ha business there would drop into gram . father 's room for a chat before leaving And grandfather 's courtesy was unfail lug . He always rose from his chair i : greeting each newcomer and he was eve a pleasing and attractive companion . Of the tales Grandfather Dent told those of particular interest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Louis in the real pioneer days Always in telling of these journey Grandfather Dent would end up b : saying : " Yes sir ! In those days only gentle men traveled , and a journey was ai event . What happens now ? You jumi in a train and are whisked through th country , and you meet all classes Why ! A damn Yankee bagman offerer me a cigar ! " That was always the close of hi story . I never saw any flaw in this dea old gentleman , but I can now see tha he was not a progressive . One trip which we often took during hose years was to the home of GrandIther and Grandmother Grant , who hen lived in Covington , Kentucky . Father 's mother , who had been Hanah Simpson , was a woman of remarkble vitality and keen intelligence . It ' as father 's opinion that his sagacity -- r , as he was wont to say , " such as I ossess " ? was an inheritance from his ; other . But while remarkably active nd keenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Grandmother ; rant visit us at the White House . All f father 's frequent efforts to induce her come to us met with refusal . And so re often went to her . Never were Lich ginger-snaps as Grandmother Grant lade . She lived to be more than ighty-five years of age , her death occurng but two years before father 's . But although grandmother would not accompany him , my grandfather , Jesse Root Grant ( after whom I was named ) frequently visited us at the White House . Small boy that I was , my sincere affection for my two grandfathers was tinged with amusement when they were together . Grandfather Dent was a courtier , with all the savoir-faire of the Old South ; while Grandfather Grant ? at heart no less kindly and considerate , and never repellent ? was by nature a taciturn , self-contained man . Perhaps the single infirmity which he would acknowledge intensified his natural reserve . With advancing years he had grown deaf . To me this was a curious deafness , for was his confidant and knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear . But to Grand- father Dent this deafness was the infirmity of extreme old age , and he always treated Grandfather Grant as one feeble and vastly his senior . Grandfather Grant would conic into a room to find Grandfather Dent ensconced in an easy chair before the fire . Tnstantly the tatter would spring to his feet . " Accept my chair , Mr. Grant . " Grandfather Grant would never hear . Stepping as spryly as the other he would seize the stiffest , most uncompromising chair at hand and draw it up to the fire . He always sat stiff and straight , never lounging in his chair . And Grandfather Dent would hover anxiously over him , urging upon him the more comfortable seat , which Grandfather Grant would never accept . Often 1 have heard Grandfather Dent say to mother , in effect : " You should take better care of that old gentleman , Julia . He is feeble and deaf as a post , and yet yo permit him to wander alon all over Washington . It i not safe ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And Grandfather Gran1 who was supposed to hea nothing , would say aside t me : " Did you hear him , Jesse I hope I shall not live t become as old and infirm a your Grandfather Dent . " To-day the thought c Grandfather Grant bring back a disappointmen through which I came to happiness that , remains on of my dearest memories . was more than nine years of before I attended school . Thi to Grandfather Grant wa reprehensible neglect upo the part of my pa rents Often grandfather prot.este to father , only to meet th quiet assurance , " Sehoc must come soon enough . " But one da3 apropos of the old school questior . Grandfather Grant said to me : " When you can write me a letter Jesse , I am going to give you this gol. watch- " And he drew from his poeke the enormous hunting-case watch h had carried for years . Under the stimulus of this promise . reward I applied myself so diligentl : that a month later I wrote a letter L. grandfather , reminding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are still too young to own s , handsome a watch , Jesse , but as soot as I am convinced that you will no play quoits with it , you shall hay it . " A year later I still remembered grandfather 's promise and mentioned to father that I thought I would agah write to grandfather about it . IL wa then but a few weeks before Christmal " I would not write , " said father . ' Wait until you see him again . " And father at once went to Galt 's nd purchased a small gold watch . He . rought this watch home before dinner hat evening and exhibited it to mother nd Nellie , pledging them to secrecy . " This is Jesse 's Christmas present , " e explained . Then , when we were at dinner , father rew the watch from his pocket and anded it to me . " Here is your watch , Jesse . " " Why Ulys ' ! " exclaimed mother . You said that was his Christmas resent . " Father turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't want to wait until hristmas , and neither do I , " he said . I have received many gifts during the ' ars that stretch behind me , many , hers from father and mother ; but not le , not even the gift of Rebbie , brought id held the thrill that came with this ? esent which father could not keep until hristmas . It brought me then someing far sweeter than satisfaction in the ft , something I felt without underanding ? and it remains with me now in iderstanding , a joy that can never fade . As I turn back to those boyhood days me disconnected , fragmentary inciuts flit across the field of memory . There was , for example , the time ten Horace Greeley came to dine the White House , with one trouser stuffed in the top of his boot . ) ots were no novelty to me , for many statesmen wore them , but I glimpsed that caught-up trouser leg before we went in to dinner , and there followed for me an interminable period of anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I call Mr. Greeley 's attention to it or should I quietly pull down that trouser leg ? In my uncertainty I did nothing . But when dinner was over and our guest gone , I spoke to father about it . " What should I have done ? " " You did quite right , my boy , " said father . " If you had pulled that pants leg down you would only have put Mr. Greeley to the trouble of tucking it up again . " And I recall one memorable afternoon ? although I can not fix the exact date ? when General Phil Sheridan , back from his assignment as military observer for the United States in the Franco-Prussian War , came to the White House to make his report to father . We were in the library ? father and mother , General Sheridan , and I. Much of the talk was technical , dealing with military maneuvers , causes , and conditions beyond my capacity to follow . Then came a question and an answer which I have never forgotten : " What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . General Sheridan hesitated , a slow smile spreading over his face . " One thought came to me and remained , growing stronger as I studied conditions . That was , that given either your army , General , or Lee 's , I could have driven the French out of Paris and the Germans back to Berlin . "
