One day Senators McKinley and Curtis called at the White House and recommended that the TJ . S. Shipping Board should be abolished and its functions transferred to the Department of Commerce . On the same day Commissioner Benson of the Board issued a report advocating that the Government build two 30,000-ton passenger liners for service with the Leviathan and lay out an annual program for 20,000 cargo tons . Next day Secretary Hoover let it be known that he did not care to have the Shipping <P> Board 's affairs transferred to his department , and the Board by majority vote transmitted a letter to the President intimating that Admiral Leigh C. Palmer , Chairman of the Emergency Fleet Corporation , should be ousted and the Board left in complete control of the Government 's merchant marine . <P> In this tangle of conflicting plans and interests , the President did much as he has done in the case of agriculture , oil , and aeronautics : he decreed a fact-finding investigation from the outside . So on the third morning he summoned to him H. G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He introduced Mr. Dalton to Admiral Palmer and the Shipping Board , and instructed him to make a survey and a report . <P> H. G. Dalton was once a " poor underpaid boy on Cleveland 's ore docks . " Now he is manager of Pickands , Mather &; Co. , a large ore and shipping concern , and President of the Interstate Steamship Co. , operators of the second largest fleet on the Great Lakes . He is an engineer familiar with shipping problems and also a competent business man . Cleveland calls him " the silent iron-king . " <P> The fourth day saw still another event . The Shipping Board adopted a resolution withdrawing from Admiral Palmer nearly all the important powers which he had exercised as head of the Emergency Fleet Corporation-virtually inviting him to resign . <P> On the fifth day Frederick I. Thompson , who has been a member of the Board for five years , presented his resignation effective Nov. 1 . Said he : <P> " It now appears certain that effort will be made to change the present shipping law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an executive branch instead of , as now , an independent administrative office of Government , similar to the Interstate Commerce Commission . I wish to retire to be free to join with others in opposing such change without having it construed that such opposition was prompted by self-interest in wishing to retain the office . " <P> Mr. Dalton has any number of fouled anchors to put in order .
