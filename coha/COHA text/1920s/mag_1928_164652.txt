Huge on the front page of the New York Evening Journal ( Hearst ) , last week , was a faithful photograph of John Davison Rockefeller . Big was the caption above : 88TH BIRTHDAY PARTY , and below : " John D. Rockefeller is celebrating his eighty-eighth birthday a day ahead of time . " The Journal , unlike Mr. Rockefeller , was a year behind time . As every one knows , Mr. Rockefeller was 89 on July 8 . But the New York Sun jumped the gun a year and said that Mr. Rockefeller was 90.
