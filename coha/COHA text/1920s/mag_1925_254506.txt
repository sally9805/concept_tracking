Last week , the Italian Boxing Federation banned the proposed bout between Erminio Spalla , heavyweight champion of Italy , and his brother , Giuseppe Spalla . Infuriated at what he termed , in an excited tirade , the mollycoddlishness of the Federation , Giuseppe declared that , if the bout could not be held in public , it would certainly take place in private , under any convenient conditions . Financial as well as athletic differences are said to have estranged Erminio and Giuseppe.
