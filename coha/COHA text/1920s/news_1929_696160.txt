txt THE DOCTORS ' HOSPITAL . The Necessity of Providing More Private Rooms for Patients . The congestion in the private pavilions of existing hospitals is quite serious . In the fifty-six ? principal hospitals only 17 per cent of the beds are in private rooms , while 80 per cent of all applications are for private rooms ; at times it is impossible to get a room even in an emergency . The situation is that those who largely support the general hospitals , and are willing and able to pay for private rooms when they have to go to a hospital , can not be taken care of . I Also , 48 per cent of the service in Ithe leading hospitals of New York City is free . That , of course , is as it should be , but it operates to put the cost of private rooms beyond the reach of the average pocketbook , which has to bear a large part of the expenses of maintaining the gen1 eral wards . 1 We should have all the free beds needed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private beds ' at reasonable cost . A lot of people of modest means have had their savings wiped out during a serious illness because they were people who felt the need of private rooms . Sometimes illness is a greater problem for the moderately well off than for the poor . Living as so many do in apartments where home nursing is impossible and separated from family and friends , an illness or an operation means temporary financial panic , which is not conducive to a mental state which aids recovery . The Doctors ' Hospital is being promoted by leading physicians and surgeons of the city who have been quietly raising funds for it these past four years . The site has been bought , the steel work is up for the fourteenstory building on East End Avenue between Eighty-seventh and Eightyeighth Streets ; the project is financed within $500,000 a the $4,000 , - 000,000 needed , what with a first mortgage loan on the property and a guaranteed loan in addition . Now the doctors are attempting to raise the final half-million by the sale of certificates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be self-supporting and it is hoped that participation will yield a modest return . The hospital is unique in that it will provide hotel accommodations for the relatives of patients who desire to ' be close at hand . This is humane , convenient and in certain cases extremely valuable in promoting recovery . It ? is feared the impression may have been created that this is to be a gilded institution for the rich . On the contrary , it is the promise of the sponsors that rates will be lower than the average for the same type of accommodations . Some of the rooms will be available at $8 and $10 a day , which is low compared with the average private hospital rate . It is possible to make- the rates lower , it is explained , since the overhead will be distributed among 300 rooms which will not have to support free beds , as is the case in the general hospitals relying on public donations . Aside from the much-needed private rooms it will provide , the physicians and surgeons sponsoring it have provided for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost unique among local hospitals . ALEXANDER LAMBERT .
