Because he was not the cinema type , Clarence Duncan Chamberlin nearly lost his chance to fly across the Atlantic , which he did in the Columbia , setting a world 's record for long-distance non-stop flight which still stands . Tersely , without dramatics , in his new book Record Flights* , he tells of bitter quarrels with Charles A. Levine , his passenger on the flight to Germany , owner of the ship , who wanted a pilot who would film well when came the time to take the movies . <P> Picturesque Bert Acosta , who later flew to France with Byrd , and ill-starred Lloyd Bertaud , who later was lost attempting the flight to Rome in Old Glory , were favored by Mr. Levine . Col. Chamberlin got the job because Inventor Giuseppe M. Bellanca , designer of the Columbia , said he flew well no matter how he filmed and weighed a lot less than either Acosta or Bertaud . <P> In the very midst of all the heated bickering , meanwhile , Charles Augustus Lindbergh set out from the very field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching ground again 33 hours and 29 minutes later in mad Paris . Chamberlin had to be content to finish second in the race across the Atlantic . Half in admiration , he reports Mr. Levine in love with flying . Halfway across the Atlantic Enthusiast Levine forced the Columbia into a 17,000-foot drop from which she was extracted with difficulty . Over Germany , Levine ordered the plane flown until the last drop of gas was gone , forcing an accident when a landing had to be made on rough ground . After each accident , said Mr. Levine in effect : " Was n't that fun ? " <P> Inventor Bellanca holds Col. Chamberlin 's unqualified admiration . He reveals that Bellanca was spurned by the War Department in 1917 and 1918 when he offered to build a bombing plane , powered with two Liberty motors , that would have a speed of 183 miles an hour fully loaded with bombs , machine guns , and crew . The Government laughed at this Sicilian dreamer , although he always lived up to his promises . Incidentally , the plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if built , would " outperform any bombing plane now in the possession of the Army or Navy of the United States . " <P> Others recognized Bellanca 's merit . Col. Chamberlin reports that Lindbergh tried to buy the Columbia from Mr. Levine and the Wright Company , which supplied the motor . Both refused to sell , satisfied that his attempt to fly to Paris alone and in a land machine was " suicide . " <P> In his book Col. Chamberlin gives thanks to Carl B. Allen , reporter on aviation for the New York World , who helped him write it . In the trade Allen would be known as a " ghost-writer . " <P> <P> * RECORD FLIGHTS-Clarence D.
