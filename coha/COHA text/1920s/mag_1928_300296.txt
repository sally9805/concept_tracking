The babble of voices grew excited , acrimonious . Facs grew red . Suddenly the State Senator clenched his fist and swung at the Governor . The Governor careened against the wall . Before he could retaliate , his secretary jumped at him , pinioned his arms . Most of the flushed group at once took sides , shouted and pummeled each other . Police were called , but when they arrived the scuffle had subsided to a murmurous discussion . <P> The Governor-solid , persevering , long-mustached Democrat George Wylie Paul Hunt of Arizona who lately failed of reelection for his seventh term ( TIME , Nov. 12 ) walked quietly down the Capitol steps . He explained that the blow he had received was " inadvertently brought about when State Senator Colter moved his arms in argument . " <P> Argument in the Southwest has arisen bitterly and often over the subject Governor Hunt and Mr. Colter had been discussing-the Swing-Johnson bill , pending these several years in Congress , for the construction by the U. S. of a 550-ft. , $125,000,000 power and irrigation dam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado River . Mostly , the arguments have seen Arizonans pitted against sons of the six other States drained by the Colorado-Wyoming , Colorado , New Mexico , Nevada , Utah , California . These have united behind California 's Representative Philip David Swing and Senator Hiram Johnson , to obtain additional drinking water for Los Angeles , flood control for California 's sub-sea-level Imperial Valley , and electric power for cities as distant as Cheyenne , Salt Lake City , Denver , San Diego . Arizona has doggedly called it a " power grab , " a selfish California scheme to exploit Arizona 's natural resource before Arizona herself is ready to use it . <P> The Swing-Johnson bill has passed the House . Arizona 's two Senators , Ashurst and Hayden , prevented its passing the Senate only by a most heroic filibuster in the closing hours of last session . This session the bill has prime place on the Senate 's calendar and Arizonans do not see how they are going to stop it again . A special engineering commission asked for by Congress last spring to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are entirely feasible , though perhaps $40,000,000 more expensive than estimated . <P> But Arizonans are bitter-enders . The Hunt-Colter fracas last week was only a minor skirmish on one side of the lines that will join battle again in Washington this winter .
