txt The Cabinet committee met today and drafted a reply to the communication from the Ulster Cabinet : The nature of the Ulster counter-proposals and the Government 's attitude toward them are kept entirely secret , on the ground that if the Government fell in with Ulster 's wish for publicity it would be ' necessary to reveal the entire course of the negotiations with the Sinn Fein : It is understood , however , that no IMmediate conference - between the Government and the Ulster representatives , is looked for in - the next few days . An interchange of letters is much more probable , and the situation now may be compared with that which confronted Premier Lloyd George at Gairloch when he was trying to find a hopeful basis for a conference with the Sinn Fein . Apart from the actual negotiations , however , both sides have their eyes turned to Liverpool , where on Wednesday and Thursday the National Unionists ' Association will meet . The real feeling of the Unionist Party throughout the country will then be revealed , and Austen Chamberlain will learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file of the party machine . ? In the meantime , Mr. Chamberlain has sent a reply to Ronald , M. P. , who called upon him to make a public statement of his attitude to " the establishment of an all-Ireland Parliament with large powers , " and declared that it was " a proposal which no statesman could make openly and remain for twenty-four hours the leader of the Unionist Party . " Promises No Coercion . Mr. Chamberlain in his reply repeats that he will , like all his Unionist colleagues , be uo party to . the coercion of Ulster . He says ' that the Prime Minister has given the same pledge . " And neither he nor ' we will depart from our word , " he adds . This promise , however , does not prevent him from seeking to make peace by agreement in Ireland . " On the result of the present negotiation , " he says , " depend issues of peace and war in these islands , perhaps the future peace of the world . I should hold - myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party if in such circumstances I did not use my utmost efforts to secure a just and honorable settlement . " Mr. Chamberlain reminds Mr. that in 1918 , when he was not a member . of the Government and Mr. Boner Law was leader of the Unionist Party , the Cabinet addressed to the Irish convention then sitting in Dublin a proposal for an Irish settlement which spoke of " the securing of an agreement to establish a single legislature for a united Ireland . " Why , " asks Mr. Chamberlain , " am I unworthy of a ? moment 's confidence because I repeat my predecessor 's invitation to Ulster to consider whether she could not with safety to herself and with advantage follow the Unionists in the South and ' enter a united Parliament under sufficient guarantees against an abuse of the powers entrusted to it , and with the full enjoyment of the autonomy already conferred upon her ? I repeat that is all I have asked . " If Ulster refuses we shall not attempt to coerce her . We shall abide by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on her decision , still more upon the spirit in which she approaches these grave issues , may depend not alone ' the fate , of Ulster , but the future history of our country and our empire . " Explains Irish Dilemma . A political , correspondent of The Daily Chronicle , Lloyd George 's organ , in explanation of the new Irish situation that has developed says : " The coercion by the British Government either of Ulster or of South Ire . /and is now out of the picture . Acceptance in principle of - the Empire and the navy by the south , which I believe to be absolutely sincere , makes the coercion of the south impossible . Acceptance of the idea of a dominion status by Ulster and the whole sentiment of the nation makes the coercion of Ulster impossible . But chaos and bloodshed are grave and immediate risks in Ireland . This is the dilemma : The Sinn Fein will concede six counties and the powers of the 1920 act to Ulster if Ulster on the other hand will accept Irish unity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield Tyrone end Fermanagh because they have a small but unfloubted Catholic majority . P. therefore , Ulster persists in refusing ony organic connection with the . rest of Ireland she is faced with a rebellion of her own in Fermanagh and Tyrone . " I do not see bow . Ulster could expect the British Government to assist her in putting down suth a rebellion . Southern - Ireland on the other hand can not overcome Ulster 's resistance by force . I:ritain could not permit it . We are therefore faced by a deadlock , with the ... -. xnste risk of chaos and ruin for either . N-egotiations May - Last for Months . LONDON , Nov. 14 ( Associated Press ) .  - -  The negotiations among British , Sinn Vein and Ulster officials regarding the future of Ireland have now entered a stage in which the negotiators are talking of intermittent conferences extending over months instead of weeks . . . Ths. chief interest this possibility has at the moment is that it promises to make impossible an early Visit of Prime Minister Lloyd George to Washington . This development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the Washington - conference has suddenly attained proportions in British eyes of an event of tremendous and absorbing significance . Counter-proposals for an Irish settle-ment to those made by the Ulster Cabi-1 net last week were forwarded , to the Ulsterites this evening by the British representatives , informing the Ulsterites that their alternative proposal was not acceptable . It now seems that the Preniler 's diplomacy must be directed to bringing Ulster into a three-cornered agreement . In the meantime , the Sinn Fein will sit on the sidelines and await developments . " The northerners are the bad boys now , " remarked one of the Sinn Fein delegates . Ulster 's watchword is " no surrender , " but some of the newspapers find comfort in the thought that this is the first stage of all in the bargain making . The crux of the difficulty rests in the Sinn Fein 's claim that Ireland must be a governmental unit , as opposed to Ulster 's claim that if Ireland is to have a dominion status , Ulster must be under independent rule . The Ulstermen attach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament for controlling their own finances and police and their newspapers constantly remind the Prime Minister of his promises not to coerce Ulster . DUBLIN . Nov. ** police today returned to the publishers the type and forms of the Sinn Fein weekly , The Irishman , which were seized by the authorities in August , 1919 . BELFAST ; Nov. ** a prelude to the conference of the Unionists at Liverpool , a mass meeting of Ulster loyalists will be held in Belfast on Wednesday .
