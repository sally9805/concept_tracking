In fact some are now buying stocks on the cry of a Hoover bull market , whereas they shorted them four years ago on the cry of a Coolidge bull market . This altered stand exists today notwithstanding that some stocks are zoock , buur-fr and in some cases 1,000% or more above what they were four years ago .

American Tobacco ' common stocks are considered among the safest dividend payers on the list , due to uniformly higher earnings . It recently declared its ninetythird consecutive common dividend . This means that it has paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Up With the Rest " I think we can get up a big bull move in X. Y. Z , " said one operator to another .
