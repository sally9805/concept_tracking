MY UNWORTHY feet have lately trodden the sacred soil of the Hoosier state , where I was born and might be living yet if I had found anybody within its confines who would give me a job when I got out of college . Since the adventurous person who ultimately did give me a job lived in New York , I became a New Yorker . Years passed ? quite a number of years when laid end to end as one usually finds them ? and I became completely denationalized as a Hoosier ; now I can eat spaghetti with one hand , but not fried chicken . Often my business took me across Indiana to Chicago , but I never went back home . And of late years I became afraid to go back to Indiana . Strange tales came from what had once been the Earthly Paradise . ( If you doubt the accuracy of that epithet , see any Indiana novel for confirmation . ) The Happy Valley had been turned into a hotbed of hatred and suspicion . The moon was still fair along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning voyagers , was unfair . Where once the Shawnee and Pottawatomie had terrorized the countryside , men and women now stood in dread of the Klcagle and the Kligrapp . Candle lights still gleamed through the sycamores , but their pallid flame was dimmed by the glare of the fiery cross . Laws of fantastic ferocity had been imposed on the blameless Hoosier , whose native mildness hardly seemed to require such stringent repression ; and the natural reaction had fomented wild and shameless orgies . Conservatives and intellectuals escaped from the state withthe same kind of relief as other conservatives and intellectuals felt when they fled across the frontier of Soviet Russia . Worst of all , said scouts who had observed the decline and fall of Indiana , the Hoosiers had become afraid to talk . They no longer even talked polities . If this were true , then indeed the glory was departed . Nevertheless I nerved myself last summer for a return to familiar scenes , a recherche du temps perdu , much in the mood of Regulus going back to Carthage . A visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventure fraught with bizarre perils . ( " Do n't drink anything in Indianapolis , " a Hoosier refugee urged me as I left New York ; " they have to put Coca-Cola in it to kill the taste . " ) But the perils , after all , could be evaded with circumspection ; what could not be evaded was the arid disappointment in the return to what had once been a Garden Spot and was now little more than a Devastated District , the discovery that the old Hoosier salt had all been washed away by Coca-Cola and other beverages dear to the Anti-Saloon League , that the Hoosier gets his politics from the Dragon or the Titan instead of rolling his own . All a mistake , friends . The decease of Indiana has been greatly exaggerated . I do not challenge the accuracy of various reporters who have brought these horrendous tales back to New York . At certain times and in certain places , no doubt all they said was true ; in certain places much of it is true still . Indiana has changed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but , so far as I could gather , in the last few months it has changed for the better , and there is hope that the patient 's improvement may be steady from now on . The organism was attacked by a violent disease , but it seems to be setting up a resistance , a reaction , that may ultimately give it immunity . And the Hoosier essence is still there . Indiana has always been a more salient and individual commonwealth than most of its Middle-Western neighbors ; it possesses what the eastern Europeans would call cultural autonomy . And that native culture seems to be , in the main , still intact . If the Hoosiers talk politics less than they used to ( and I heard plenty of politics talked ) it may be not so much that they are afraid of listening Klansmen as that the savage stringency of their state prohibition law has inevitably made liquor a topic of absorbing interest . " We think too much about liquor out here , " an eminent Hoosier confessed to me , " and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when the state legislature declares that liquor or the prohibition of liquor is more than the Constitution and the ethics of a gentleman and everything else , everybody 's sense of values is twisted a little out of focus . If we had a sane liquor law the topic might shrink to its proper size . " Yet I think I heard as much talk about automobiles as about liquor , and with good reason . Walking is a lost art in Indiana ; whoever has to go farther than across the road takes an automobile ; if there is any Hoosier so debased that he does not own an automobile ( which I doubt ) he is less than the dust beneath his neighbors ' chariot wheels . The foreigner , rashly proposing to walk two blocks down the street , is regarded as a dangerous person of Bolshevist tendencies , attempting to corrupt MiddleWestern purity by introduction of the un-American customs of the Atlantic seaboard . The colleges of the state might well add a new event to their track meets ? the hundred-yard walk , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Darwin and his allied and associated evolutionists are right ( this is one of the few topics on which the Indiana legislature has not yet laid down the law ) , legs in Indiana will presently become vestigial , and ultimately will drop off altogether . Some few ladies may retain them for purposes of ornament ? not too many , it may be hoped but for the rest of the population legs have already been replaced by the automobile . The Hoosier of to-day talks about engine trouble and tire mileage as much as his grandfather talked about his rheumatism , and for the same reason . So I am not much impressed by this alleged decline of political conversation . Changes there have been ; but the two great cottage industries that made the state famous ? literature and polities ? . flourish as luxuriantly as ever . While these twin pillars stand the Hoosier temple is secure . Outwardly the Indiana of to-day looks about the same as the Indiana of 1010 , except a little more weatherbeaten ; about the only additions to the architecture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This gives a curious sense of timelessness to the New Yorker who is used to seeing his home town pulled down and rebuilt before his eyes every few weeks ; none the less , there is something to be said for the Hoosier theory of using a serviceable house till it wears out rather than squander all your savings on building another just a little better . That is , there would be something to be said for the theory if it were true . But I am told that Hoosiers do not build houses because they spend all their money for automobiles ; they wear out ' old clothes because the money that once bought clothes now buys gasoline . It does seem that houses which have been on the premises for several decades might at least be painted once in a while ; and I understand that a couple of years ago there was a general movement toward renovation . But just about that time the Florida boom came along , and the money which had been saved up to paint the house went to Florida and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countless millions in Florida ; so did a few other Hoosiers who got in on the ground floor . But the rest of Indiana , the general sucker investor , got just about what the general sticker investor usually gets . It was a hard blow because it came at a time when the state , in common with the whole corn belt , was hard up . Many a farmer had counted on paying off the mortgage with his profit on the resale of those waterfront lots in Florida ; and now , as the diplomats say , he is compelled to envisage a new situation . Relatively , if not absolutely , Indiana is less prosperous to-day than it was in 1910 , which may have something to do with the changes of temperament , of interest , of emphasis which have undoubtedly occurred . But in the main , of course , these alterations are traceable , directly or in reflex , to the Ku Klux Klan . One finds it hard to imagine why the Klan has such a hold on Indiana . What has the nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly ten per cent of Catholics and one per cent of Jews ? Well , he finds a good deal to be afraid of . One hears strange tales among Hoosiers ? for instance , that the lease on the Vatican has expired , and the Pope , unable to pay the increased rent demanded by his landlord , is now living in disguise in Cincinnati , ready to cross the frontier the first dark night , seize Indiana by a coup d ' hat , and turn it into a papal satrapy . ( His Holiness will find a lot of friends in Dearborn County , the border march adjacent to Cincinnati , which is undoubtedly a weak point in the Hoosier cordon sanitaire . ) Just why , out of all the Protestant communities on this planet , the Pope should select Indiana as the object of his wicked desires , is not apparent to the foreigner ; but to the Hoosier it is clear enough . Indiana is the most desirable spot on earth , and any potentate might reasonably covert it . ( The locus classicus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man From Home . ) At any rate this theory seems to be widely held in the rural districts , and the Protestants arc all on guard . The intelligent people of Indiana ( and despite emigration , forced and otherwise , the state is still probably well above the average in percentage of intelligent people ) find it hard to understand how these abysmal depths of ignorance , bigotry , malice , and pure wrong-headedness can exist in a state which has long been noted for the excellence of its schools , which has probably produced more normal-school principals and professors of pedagogy than any other commonwealth in the country . But a report on the state schools , published a few years ago , after investigation by a local committee which could not be suspected of alien bias , throws some light on this topic . Indiana got its pedagogic reputation by an early start . About 1870 its schools were the best in the world , by the standards of 1870 . They still are ? by the standards of 1870 ; but states which give more attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little better by the standards of 1926 . ( It may or may not be an accident , but the principal signer of this report moved to Chicago shortly after its publication . ) Possibly this willingness to stand on a reputation won long ago accounts for the spread of the Klan . It is well known that the Klan began to take hold of Indiana about the time it began to lose ground in the South . Perhaps it spread because it gave to persons of no importance a sense of consequence and an illusion of something to do . In Indiana it certainly owed much to the organizing ability of a Grand Dragon who , one was told at the time , had " sold " the Klan in Indiana on the basis of love rather than hatred . That the gentleman 's concept of love was somewhat violent is suggested by the fact that he was presently tried for rape and murder and is now serving a twenty-year sentence in the penitentiary ; yet the argument has this much support , that the Klan in Indiana has carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states where it flourished . In Indiana the Klan has done its work in politics ; which proves that the Hoosier Klansmen , after all , are essentially Hoosiers , expressing themselves in politics as all Hoosiers will . The 1Oe4 election gave the Klan control of the state . First of all the Klan , with the Anti-Saloon League , got control of the Republican party . The Republican state ticket ran far behind Coolidge that year , but Coolidge pulled it through . Possibly he does not deserve all the credit ; the Republican candidate for Governor , Major Ed Jackson , and the Democratic candidate , Colonel Carleton McCulloch , were both Nordic Protestants ; but McCulloch had not made Nordic Protestantism a gainful occupation and he suffered the added handicap of being an intellectual . At any rate , the Kan and the Anti-Saloon League got control of the state and proceeded to cash in on it . The state prohibition law which they passed ? the " smell law " ? is a marvellous document . One hears of legislators who staggered from a whiskey-laden table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey-laden table ; but Indiana is not the only state which lives by the great principle that it matters not how a legislator drinks so long as he votes right . Certainly , the statute which they put on the books is the culmination , in one way or another , of the process that started with Magna Carta ; the Nordic genius for self-government never produced anything more remarkable . To sell , possess , or give away liquor calls for a mandatory jail sentence ofthirty days to six months ( for a first offense ) ; so does the display of a cocktail shaker in a drug-store window . One who is merely intoxicated in public may escape with a fine ; one who drives an automobile while intoxicated ? an offense which accounts for a good many traffic killings a year , in Indiana and elsewhere ? goes to jail for from thirty days to six months . But one who transports even a spoonful of liquor in an automobile ? unless he transports it in his own digestive system ? is guilty of a felony and goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a distilling apparatus is prima facie evidence of intention of unlawful use , and the possessor is a felon who spends from one to five years in a penitentiary . If any fluid is poured out or carried away while the premises are being searched , it shall be held to be prima facie intoxicating liquor intended for unlawful use or sale . Proof of the possession of empty bottles that have contained intoxicating liquor shall be admissible as evidence ? and the smell of the bottle is often sufficient . Also , if a bottle is found on your premises , though a passer-by may have thrown it over the fence , it is your bottle unless you can prove the contrary . It only remains to add that this amiable enactment provides that " any citizen , organization , or association within this state " ( which of course means the Klan and the Anti-Saloon League ) may employ an attorney to assist the prosecutor ; and that charges shall not be dismissed unless the reason for so doing is laid before this attorney for his inspection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be made righteous by the power of the secular arm , Indiana ought to be the Spotless Commonwealth . And what is the result ? Why , one result I have already mentioned ? that a young woman lately back from Indianapolis told me that they had to use Coca-Cola to kill the taste ; and another refugee from Indianapolis told me that they got drunk and rolled on the floor , lost to all sense of moderation . But I gather that both the virtue and the iniquity of Indiana have been greatly exaggerated . ( That is the penalty of spending as many years as I spent in the newspaper business ; one discovers that everything has been greatly exaggerated . ) I did not see , in Indiana , anybody drunk and rolling on the floor ; nor did I encounter anything the taste of which needed to be killed by Coca-Cola . I understand that among the lower classes , unable to pay the prices which the better element puts up for whisky brought in via Detroit , a favorite drink is Jamaica ginger diluted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in breaking up this traffic because the state law merely forbids intoxicating liquor " and every other drink , mixture , or preparation of more than one half of one per cent of alcoholic content reasonably likely or intended to be used as a beverage . " It had never occurred to anybody that Jamaica ginger was reasonably likely to be used as a beverage . Those whose delicacy is affronted by Jamaica ginger are said to sate their unlawful desires by dropping a tablet of aspirin into a bottle of Coca-Cola . The effect is alleged to be powerful while it lasts ; it wears off in half an hour or so , but then you procure another tablet of aspirin and another bottle of Coca-Cola . Maybe so ; I am a middle-aged family man with no appetite for adventure ; I did n't try it . Nor does it seem that anybody with friends in Indiana would need to try it ; the prohibition law is said to be effective in the country districts , where there was never much drinking anyway ; but , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high in Indianapolis as anywhere in the country , except for New York and the East Coast of Florida . Then is this majestic statute , this super-prohibition law , ineffective ? Not a bit ; but one gathers that it operates only against certain people . If somebody who stands well with the authorities is arrested , the case may be shifted to a lenient court ; and if he stands well enough with the authorities he is not even arrested . One hears of delegates to a Republican convention drinking their fill in rooms protected by policemen , just as it is said to be done on the wicked Atlantic seaboard . But then the Republicans are the Klan party , the AntiSaloon League party , the party of law enforcement , and naturally their delegates are privileged . Some people undoubtedly have had bad luck . They tell a tale in Indianapolis of a burglar who broke into a house and was discovered by the householder . Dodging about in the cellar , with the police closing in on him outside , he had the good luck to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind which is perfectly legitimate under the Volstead Act but obnoxious to the higher morality of Indiana . Clutching a bottle in each hand , the burglar walked gleefully out into the arms of the police ; and the householder was forthwith arrested and sent to jail , while the burglar , so far as the story tells , was set free as a watchful and law-abiding citizen . No Hoosier who has a treasured bottle anywhere around the house dares to fire his cook , or get into a dispute with the plumber . Plumbers , and carpenters , and readers of gas and electric meters are said to look for liquor with great diligence when they enter a house ; if they can reach it they take some of it ; if not they reserve their information in case there is any argument about the bill . In so far as the moral leaders of the United States are laboring to make this a country of spies , of sneaks , of snoopers , and informers ( which is pretty far ) Indiana undoubtedly has a good running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts of the state is arrested for speeding , his ear is usually searched for liquor . The Supreme Court has held that this search is illegal , but in many counties it goes on just the same . There is a difference of opinion at present , among sheriffs and prosecutors , as to whether it is illegal to stop your car by the roadside , with all the lights on . A good many sheriffs hold that such conduct is prima facie evidence of immoral purposes ; and when they seize a ear thus stationary they are apt to search it , in the hope that a half-empty flask may let the occupants in for a year in the penitentiary . All of this sounds as if Indiana were a dreadful place to live ; but as usual , things are not so bad as they sound . Any Hoosier who has no influential friends may find himself in trouble at any moment ; but not so many do . As with all laws whose ferocity far outruns public sentiment , the violence of this one is considerably mitigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sell liquor and those who possess it for their own use , between traveling bootleggers merchandising from their automobiles and tourists who happen to have brought a bottle up from Florida in a suitcase . Judges , too , are apt to make some effort to fit the penalty to the crime ; jail sentences arc mandatory but they can be suspended , and of Len are ; and where judges and prosecutors fail , juries often ? though not always ? do the same . It would be pleasing to report that this is the work of the old and famous Hoosier sense of humor , but apparently it is not . It is , to be sure , the work of the sense of proportion , of which the sense of humor is only a variant ; but humor as such , so far as I can observe , is less common in Indiana than it used to be . At any rate , where the sense of humor fails , the sense of self-interest comes in . Chicago automobile clubs have advised all persons driving to Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sheriffs who delight in ripping apart every car that comes through in the hope of finding a spoonful of evidence which may send a felon away to the pen . This has resulted in a considerable loss of trade for Indiana hotels and filling stations ; and human nature being what it is , that fact has registered on the minds of Hoosier authorities . The prohibition law has undoubtedly promoted greater kindness to cooks and greater fraternity with plumbers ; it has skilled Hoosiers in the Spartan virtues of caution and evasion ; it has taught men to mistrust their friends , which , according to current American morality , is that much to the good . It has done a good deal , but I doubt if it has greatly reduced the volume of drinking , though it has certainly boosted the price of liquor . But then there is little evidence that any prohibition law is primarily intended to reduce the volume of drinking . But even the transcendent purpose of prohibition laws , the cementing of the power of the Anti-Saloon League and its allies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The State superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League has had thingshis own way for some time . Once , with a group of friends he gestured at an Anheuser-Busch sign overhead . IF " Ai n't it dreadful , boys , that that sign should be allowed to stand ? " " But , Doctor , " protested one of his hearers , " that sign advertises ginger ale . " " I know , " said the good doctor sadly , " but the very name makes people think of beer . " Lately , however , the worthy doctor has found himself in trouble . In his annual report he imprudently accused the state Supreme Court of " wet tendencies , " and was in due course cited for contempt . At this writing the question is still under debate , but the defendant 's attorneys have found it advisable to set up the defense that he was only exercising the inalienable right of every citizen to free thought and free speech . When the Anti-Saloon League has to come out for free speech , it has lost its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently less powerful than it used to be , though still powerful enough . Two years ago it had most of the state press terrorized ; the two old-established Indianapolis papers shook speechless in their boots , and the Times , which dared oppose the Klan in politics , found that its carriers were folg lowed by Klansmen who stopped at every house where a Times was left and warned the householder that he had better stop reading the vile sheet . But of late various papers , if not exactly coming out against the Klan , have at least dared to admit that it is not necessarily a felony for citizens to hold opinions disapproved by the ruling oligarchy . The conviction of the late Dragon seems partly responsible for this ; he managed to run the state government from jail during his trial but seems to be less successful in running it from the remote penitentiary near the Michigan line . His removal dislocated the Klan leadership and , so far as the profane outsider can gather , it even set up two discordant parties among the sheeted paladins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Titan was lately fined for rape ; and this behavior of Titans and Dragons suggests that perhaps the Klan 's enthusiasm for female purity proceeds ultimately from a jealous cherishing of the droit de seigneur . One great effect the Klan domination is having ? the political solidification of most of the intelligent people of the state . For the Klan in Indiana is essentially a proletarian dictatorship . Like all proletarian movements , it includes a few astute individuals , themselves anything but proletarian , who control it and direct it in their own interests ; but its membership is almost exclusively composed of the hill-billies , the Great Unteachables . And because the state is controlled by organized ignorance and malice , most of the intellectuals have been forced together for self-defense . You find plenty of men and women in Indiana who tell you that they arc Republicans but vote the Democratic ticket . Not that all the Klansmen are Republicans ; but the majority of Democratic sentiment is against them , whereas the Republican party from Jim Watson down is only the tail to the Klan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans and Democrats is little more than a hereditary tradition ; but the tradition is still powerful . If the Klan control of the Republican organization lasts long enough , there will be a real class distinction between the parties in Indiana . The Democrats will be the aristocrats , the party of intelligence ; the Republican strength will lie in the unlettered masses and in the few rich men who find the unlettered masses useful in their business . Twenty years ago it was otherwise ; the strength of Hoosier Democracy lay in the masses , the majority of the intellectuals were Republicans . But the Republicans , calling themselves the party of intelligence and morality , have visibly become in Indiana the party of ignorance and vicarious morality ; there is no place for the intellectuals to go but over to the Democrats . This division is hardly likely to last , of course ; presently the Klan will lose the Republican organization and allegiances will return to the old home . Probably it should not last ; for the alignment of all the intelligence of the state on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences which contribute a good deal to the salty variety of Hoosier culture . Here again , prohibition and the fanatical violence of its supporters have erected a paramount issue which throws all difference of opinion on minor matters into the shade . But this is only a tendency ; a tendency powerful just now , but by no means solidified into an enduring state . Many things have happened to Indiana , but much of the essential Hoosierism remains untouched . For ? I revert to my theme ? the essence of Indiana is literature and politics ; and in those basic key-industries Indiana is still there . A year or two ago there was some little apprehension about the future of Indiana literature . The tall sycamores of Hoosier letters ? Tarkington , Me , Nicholson , McCutcheon ? still towered above the forest , but they were beginning to be weary in well doing ; and they had dominated the field for so long that they had discouraged competition . Ambitious young Hoosiers had developed the habit of going to Detroit to produce automobiles instead of settling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the younger writers , Mr. Scoggins , chose to employ his talent on the alien scene of Latin America . Something had to be done in the way of planting the next crop if the romantic optimism of the Mid-Western corn belt were not to yield to the gloomy realism of the Northwestern wheat belt . Hence the Indiana Literary Field Day , held at Culver Military Academy , one of the oldest and best-known schools in the Middle West , and promoted by a committee which hung up a series of prizes for the best essays , stories , poems , plays , and book illustrations by school and college students . The prizes included cash money , in sufficient amount to make the average student wonder if after all literature was not about as profitable as running a garage ; and the conferring of the awards was made a ceremony more impressive , to the winners , than any university 's bestowal of honorary LL.D . ' s . In the way of literary pageantry there has been nothing to approach it since Herodotus read his history at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poetry contest at the Wartburg . The action takes place on a perfect spring day , on the shores of Lake Maxinkuckee , with a background of semi-military , semi-academic buildings and an overhead canopy of maples and elms . All around are seated the beauty and chivalry of Indianapolis and way stations , not forgetting a considerable delegation from Indiana 's best known extramural extension , Chicago . For extra men and gentlemen of the chorus , several hundred cadets in full uniform , which is full enough to realize any schoolgirl 's dream of military splendor . On the platform in front of Memorial Hall are assembled as many as possible ? which is a good many , Culver efficiency and Culver hospitality being equally well known ? of Indiana authors , editors , publishers , publicists , and critics , pedestaled like the statues in the Siegesallee , that all aspiring young literati may have them pointed out ? " This is what you too may become , if you only persevere . " Leading up to this high altar of Pallas Athene a shaded walk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and above everything , on the steps of the Memorial Hall , the trooping of the colors , laureled banners of the schools and colleges to which the prize winners belong , that each young laureate may remember that he not only gets some money for it himself but reflects glory on alma mater . The prize winner 's name is called ; the cadet color bearer takes the proper banner down the walk ; behind the banner the prize winner ascends to the High Place , escorted by a cadet aide , his tall helmet surmounted by a taller black plume , his gilt-buttoned uniform girt with a scarlet sash and a clanking sword ; and with a roll of drums and flourish of trumpets the name and school and achievement of the prize winner is solemnly recited to the applauding crowd and the incipient author is welcomed into the goodly fellowship of Indiana literati . Why , the ceremony has as much pomp , and as profound an emotional impact , as a presidential inauguration or a pontifical high mass . The romantic youth or day-dreaming girl who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gang wants to do something else , the ugly duckling of a scholastic community whose chief interest is probably centered on basketball , suddenly finds that he ( or she ) is being saluted as one whom Indiana dclighteth to honor . At the impressionable age , the effect is terrific . U this idea had been put into practise twenty years ago the Younger Generation of Hoosier letters would not be so thin as it is now . Young writers need encouragement , and many a high-school teacher who grades themes when he would like to be writing poems , many a ruined real estate man sitting on the sandy shores of Biscayne Bay , wondering how he can raise carfare back to Kokomo , might have been turned in time to literature if in his day General Gignilliat of Culver had been playing Ma'cenas as he does now , giving young writers not only cash , but the credit which ( to writers below the age of thirty ) is considerably more important . This all-day festivity , as perfectly managed in every detail as a dress parade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a pageant covering most of the history of the world 's literature . The glory that was Greece , the grandeur that was Rome , the unassuming merit that is Indiana , were all depicted in successive tableaux ; Shakespeare , Milton , Turkington , Ade , Riley , Nicholson , had their turn on the stage ; and then the grand climax , the one far-off divine event toward which the whole creation moves ? the prize winners of the day grouped in the spotlight , the high point of literature to which Ade and Xsehyliis had been only guideposts pointing the way . To what purpose ? Why , to persuade these young people that Red Grange and Gloria Swanson have not monopolized all the glories of the universe ; that a poet may reflect as much credit on his college as an All-Western quarterback ; that merit is searched out and recognized outside the sports page ? which is not such a bad thing to impress on college students . And the result ? Well , such prize-winning pieces of literature as I saw were pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not uncommon ; but the years of unwearied practice that are needed before most writers can cash in on their talent are apt to come hard ; many a writer , potentially as good as most of us who actually write , falls by the wayside and takes to selling used cars as the easiest way . None of these Culver prize winners is apt to do that ; not with the feeling that Indiana has given them a slap on the back and shoved them along the right path , that the whole state is behind them , giving three cheers as they run cheerfully the race that is set before them . To be sure , this pageant may have given the young people the idea that the life of letters is roses , roses all the way ; which ? crede experto ? it is not . I could suggest certain tableaux which were omitted : an author 's wife standing off the bill collector while her husband frantically telephones to the receiver of a bankrupt magazine , asking if there is any hope of getting that check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's desk , receiving the news that the returns of copies of his latest book are in excess of sales ; a scenarist learning from a film magnate that his works contain entirely too much Sex Appeal to get past Will Hays . But to have injected these into the Field Day would have been AS indelicate as to put mention of married quarrels and crying children into a wedding ceremony ? as indelicate and as injudicious . Indiana , like Nature , strives to trap her children into serving her purpose , and hopes that the radiant memories of the honeymoon may carry them through some of the realities to follow . Incidentally , students from the Catholic schools of the state won about half of these prizes , which ought to reassure the Klansmen that Catholic Hoosiers are after all Hoosiers of purest ray serene . Perhaps it will ; for Hoosier Catholicism contains one notable institution which never seems to have incurred the hostility that frowns upon the Pope and his other works ? the Notre Dame football team . I gather that few Klansmen are so embittered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the state 's most powerful instrument of nation-wide publicity , wins another victory . To be sure , it is whispered that most of the squad are Protestants ; that under Mr. Knute Rockne the Fighting Irish have become in great measure the Fighting Scandinavians . But this , if true , is only a symptom of the recrudescence of tolerance . The good fathers of Notre Dame are not so bigoted as to reject a triple-threat man because he happens to be a Lutheran ; nor do the embattled Protestants down state fail to throw their hats in the air over the only Indiana football team that ever wins any notable victories , merely because it fights under the papal banner . VI After literature , politics ? after it only in the temporal sense , before it in metaphysical preexistence ; for politics in Indiana is alpha and omega , the beginning and the end . I went to a Democratic State Convention , and any doubts that might have survived as to the still , there-ness of Indiana were straightway dissipated . It did n't look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among thirteen hundred delegates there were not half a dozen black frock coats and string ties , and women were as frequent on the floor as in the gallery . But they were the same old sort of people ; what is more , they behaved in the same old way . The business of the convention was the adoption of a platform , and the selection of a Senatorial candidate to oppose the Honorable and perennial James Eli Watson . There was a prospect of a fight on the floor over the platform ; a belligerent faction wanted to demand the repeal of this famous state prohibition law . Now anybody knows what a Democratic national convention wouldhave done in a situation like that ? it would have fought all day and all night and gone home to vote for Coolidge . Not so in Indiana . Probably most of the delegates thought the prohibition law was outrageous , but they were not quite sure that most of the voters did ; the movement to demand repeal , instead of dying with its boots on in full convention , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a platform which referred to prohibition only in opposing unlawful and unconstitutional searches and seizures . ( When a Republican convention stands by the constitution it means it is for prohibition ; when a Democratic convention stands by the constitution it means it is against prohibition . ) Then came the fight for the Senatorial nomination . There were half a dozen candidates between most of whom the differences were merely regional . There was to be sure one wet candidate ; he stood for an issue , the paramount issue of the moment ; he took his stand firmly and unequivocally on one side of that issue ; he represented a Principle . Therefore , he ran sixth in a field of six on the first ballot and practically disappeared off the map on the second . Indiana knows that principles and politics do n't mix . For the rest , there was in the first place Mr. John E. Fredrick , who was supposed to have the favor of Mr. Thomas Taggart . One hears that Mr. Taggart had no favorite , but much of the old organization backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strong in the southwestern part of the state but not much favored elsewhere ; and there were three or four others , including a Mr. Stump . Nobody knew much about this young Mr. Stump , except that he had a good war record and was much in demand as a speaker at high-school commencements . He had no strong political backing , and it did not occur to anybody ( until the first ballot showed him running surprisingly well ) that a high-school commencement orator makes a wide acquaintance which he can cash in on if he knows how . Mr. Stump knew how ; on the second ballot he was second only to Fredrick ; but on the third ballot Fredrick threw in his strength , he rose to within a few dozen votes of the six hundred and sixty necessary to a choice , it was perfectly plain that on the fourth ballot Fredrick would go over . Then something happened . Fredrick had attacked Cullop on the ground that he was too old . Well , thought Cullop , Mr. Stump is young and looks younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him . Before the result of the third i ballot was announced one county after another began to change its vote , from Cullop to Stump . Cullop had only a hundred or two of votes left , but they were scattered in many counties . County by county , he threw them in ? five votes here and seven there , a spoonful at a time but impressive in their cumulative effect . Well-instructed delegates began to shout ; the band in the gallery began to play ; a score of chairmen of county delegations clamored for the chair 's attention to get a chance to change their votes . Hasty and belated , the Fredrick managers tried to set a backfire ; what little under-cover strength they had left was thrown in by the same method , the changing of county votes before the result of the ballot was announced . But already they had used almost everything they had , counting on natural momentum to put them over on the next ballot ; and in politics as in war the last unbroken reserve turns the tide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he threw to Stump when the Fredrick managers were just beginning to get up steam . That upset 1 the equilibrium and from that time on it was only a question of who could get on the Stump band wagon first . In ten minutes , Mr. Fredrick had been pulled off the very steps of the throne and tumbled into the junk room . I have seen a good many conventions , state and national , but I never saw anything so smoothly done as that . Military historians tell us that the Germans won the war of 1870 because while the French were figuring out what was the right thing to do the Germans were doing the right thing by pure reflex action . So is it in Indiana politics ; in a crisis their muscles and their adrenal glands do most of their thinking for them . They have made a life work of it ; they know how . But the end of a perfect day was still to come . There appeared on the speakers ' stand Captain Albert Stump , the nominee of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituents . It was a trying moment for a young and inexperienced man ; but evidently Mr. Stump also knew how . Not a word that could inflame aching wounds ; not a word that did not make for peace , harmony , and optimism . What he said I do not remember ; but I have a general impression that he spoke favorably of God and the flag , and he certainly said something agreeable about home and mother . When he had finished thirteen hundred Democrats went out with the comfortable feeling that they had picked the best possible candidate ; a man who was every Democrat 's friend and no Democrat 's enemy , who would come as near as any man could to enabling every county leader to carry his county ticket . Only one thought saddened us unterrified Democrats as we left that convention ball ? the memory of the glorious opportunity that had been booted away at Madison Square Garden two years before . If only the national party could acquire something of the guile of Cullop and the tact of Stump ? But nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I came home feeling that despite kleagles and " smell laws " and hard times , the decline and fall of Hoosier culture was a myth unsupported by the evidence . Stands Indiana where she did ? She does !
