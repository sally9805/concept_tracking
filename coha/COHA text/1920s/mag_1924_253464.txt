The production of a non-corroding steel is not new . It has been going on successfully for some time . But the expense of manufacture has been so high that-except for specialized uses , such as for tableware-it has been impractical . To mention only a few general advantages which would accrue to industry from a cheap non-corroding steel it would : <P> 1 ) Make the use of steel possible in many places where other less desirable materials are now used , because not subject to rust . <P> 2 ) Make a tremendous saving in replacements where metal is exposed to the weather , as in the case of farm machinery , wire fences . <P> 3 ) Make , perhaps , an even greater saving in the amount of paint used and the cost of painting and repainting . <P> 4 ) Make possible the use of steel and iron for many ornamental and artistic purposes . <P> Now , according to reports from Pittsburgh , a cheap process of making stainless iron and steel is being tried out in a number of large mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He , his brother A. H. Wild , founder of a large steel concern in Sheffield , and George Pugiley , another Sheffield man , expert in the open-hearth and electric steel processes , are demonstrating the manner of production . <P> The process consists in a special method of treating chromite , a natural iron ore with a chromium content , in such a way as to preserve the desired percentage of chromium . Ronald Wild asserts that the process is cheap enough so that " rustless tubes , automobiles and even ships " are possible .
