txt One Woman Remembers the Monitor For years I have been a constant reader of your paper , and am now ST 3-ears old . I distinctly remember the joy I felt when the little Monitor sailed down to Hampton Roads and saved our beloved country . I think it lifted a very great cloud from our people , who were striving so bravely to uphold the Union . We never can be too thankful to the great mind that designed and brought out the Monitor . just in time to defeat its adversary the nest morning . Can any thoughtful mind do other than discard hick and chance , and not nor the Providence that reigns over the affairs a 11,011 ? Language can not express the great honor we should bestow on Ericsson , who came " through the gatos ? an immigrant and became a great American . PHOEBE M. MIN:WING . Orange , N. J. , Aug .
