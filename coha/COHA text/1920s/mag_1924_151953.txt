They declared : <P> " Before the last Congressional election in November , 1922 , there were not more than 50 pro-labor and forward-looking Congressmen .

These are distributed among the various parties as follows : Democrats , 105 ; Republicans , 63 ; Farmer-Labor , 1 ; Independent , 1 ; total , 170 - an increase of 120 Congressmen in one election . The relection of these 170 and the election of 80 more Congressmen representing the people will bring the people a safe working majority of 250 out of a total of 435 members . <P> " The election of 50 such Congressmen ( less than half the increase of the last election ) would give the people a bare majority . <P> " Not one measure opposed by Labor was enacted into law by the present Congress .

Among other vicious proposals were the sales tax , efforts to hush scandals that have been partly uncovered in Government departments , the veto of the postal employes ' wage bill and the veto of the soldiers ' adjusted compensation . <P> " Eleven measures that were approved by the American Federation of Labor and in favor of which representatives of the American Federation of Labor appeared were passed by both Houses and enacted into law .
