In Manhattan . Rosa Ponselle , in the white draperies of a vestal virgin , was fervently wooed by Edward Johnson , U. S. tenor , disguised as a Roman soldier in the Metropolitan 's revival of La Vestale , a totally unoriginal opera written 100 years ago by Gasparo Spontini . Critics agree that this composer understood one thing- how to write for the voice . For the rest he depended on Gluck and what he could remember of Mozart . Elaborately staged , furbished with the faultless voice of Miss Ponselle , it will , they think , be popular . <P> During one of the intermissions William Guard , kindly lieutenant of Manager Gatti-Casazza , called pressmen into his office , informed them that they had been wrong to say that La Vestale was being presented for the first time in the U. S. ; it was given in the fall of 1828 , he said , by the French Opera Company of New Orleans . <P> Mme. Toti Dal Monte , " world 's smallest prima donna , " Feoder Chaliapin , Mme. Johanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A rotund Italian baritone , Mario Basiola , made his dbut as the King of Ethiopia in Ada , . <P> Falstaff was given . U. S. Baritone Lawrence Tibbett , who stopped the performance last year , sang his monologue ably but failed to get more applause than he deserved . <P> Costume-makers went on strike . <P> In Chicago a U. S. singer unknown to fame , one Richard Bonelli , made his dbut as Germont Sr. in La Traviata . He proved to have one of those baritone voices that make connoisseurs think of the golden , summery booming of an enormous bee . The audience called him out for endless curtain calls . Said critics : <P> " A fine , new , mature American baritone , capable , apparently , of bringing something interesting to any rle the company wishes to entrust to his adept treatment .
