Long-haired preachers come out every night , <P> And they tell you what 's wrong and what 's right . <P> But when asked about something to eat <P> They will answer in voices so sweet : <P> " You will eat by and by . <P> When it snows in the month of July- <P> Work and pray , live on hay- <P> You 'll eat pie in the sky when you die . " <P> - Joe Hill <P> Forty preachers who were visiting the Manhattan headquarters of the International Workers of the World , on an industrial seminar arranged by the social relations department of the Congregational Church , read this song in the I.W.W. hymn book and smiled . Owing to the politeness of I.W.W. members they were not called upon to sing it ; they joined , instead in carolling another I.W.W. hymn of which the words were less derisive : <P> We meet to-day in freedom 's cause And raise our voices high ; <P> We 'll join our hands in union strong to battle or to die . <P> The ministers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. , next visited the headquarters of the Communist party where they heard Harry W. Wicks , an editor of The Daily Worker making a speech . First he assailed preachers for their failure to take an active interest in labor problems ; then he began to speak about famed clergyman John Roach Straton : " He is the most palpable ignoramus in the U. S. ! " said H. W. Wycks . Then he added , " Fortunately , there are not many like him . " The 40 ministers said , " Thank God for that . " <P> The result of four days of radical meetings and investigation was embodied in a report , containing no particularly revolutionary significance , which the 40 preachers prepared . This report stated that the Church should seek industrial enlightenment ; that America lacks labor leaders of broad intelligence ; and that the Church can do much to ameliorate present conditions by studying all the facts and showing employers and labor their common needs .                 @ @ @ @
