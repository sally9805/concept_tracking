txt The rising percentage of graduating classes that goes , or expects to go , into industry , banking or trade has long been familiar in the United States . Large corporations are more closely on the watch than ever before for educated talent . The thing has not been thought so common in England and , in reality , has not been , until recent years . Just now the University of Cambridge is about to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of its Appointments Board . The object of it was to help to secure employment for young graduates in various occupations and pursuits , besides the professions . The plan was confessedly influenced by American practice . One of the moving spirits was Sir ARTHUR SHIPLEY , now Master of Christ 's College , who writes of a visit forty years ago to New York , where he met leaders in finance and commerce who told him of the increasing use which they were making in their business of college graduates . The project , when first proposed at Cambridge , was regarded as an innovation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt to break down the ancient dignity of a gentleman and a scholar . But the obstacles were overcome and the authorities were even induced to make a grant of fluids to the Appointments Board . They were persuaded by the argument of one of the tutors that the university was spending thousands of pounds to make it easy for students to come to it , and it was not unreasonable to ask a little money so as to make it easy for them to go away . The work was slow in getting started . And the end in view was not always understood at first . One of the early applications was to furnish a secretary to a ladies ' club in Paris , the only stipulations being that he must be " young , good-looking and a bachelor . " But little by little the Appointments Board won the confidence both of undergraduates and men prominent in the business world , with the result that greater and greater numbers of students have obtained positions of an industrial , scientific or administrative character . In 1913 , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work after graduation . Their employment has been of every conceivable variety . Many of them have gone into Government service abroad . Others have risen rapidly in large business enterprises in the Orient and elsewhere . Not long ago a request came to the board to supply a director of a sort of public school for educating the police force of a small foreign nation . The right man for the job was found . With a good record of success , confidence in the Appointments Board has become widespread among heads of large concerns and administrative officers . They have come to believe that all they have to do is to apply to the university to secure just the person they want . The story is that the board once received a cablegram from a great traffic organization on the Continent , reading : " Send Traffic Officer at once . " Classic or Moral Science man pre " ferred . " It would be hard to find a more striking tribute to the practical value of the higher education .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
