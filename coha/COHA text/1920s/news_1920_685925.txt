txt AFTER THE ELECTION . Some Views on the Result of Tuesday 's Vote . To the Editor of The New York Times : Mr. Harding as President will need the prayers of the people as much as any President has done since Air . Lincoln . President Lincoln needed deliverance from his enemies . Mr. Harding will need it from the diverse and often antagonistic groups who will press their claims as his friends . No one can hate the man for whom he hagitually prays . This through the anxious years of the war and sinco has fixed the course of many who In the face of bitter and persistent accusation against President Wilson have remained loyal to him . It will be well if in the days to come the country can holed to bring its support to Mr. Harding for the same reason . There is no reason to believe that he is pledged to any individual , but there is every reason to know that he will be beset as few Presidents have been . HENRY A. STIMSON .
