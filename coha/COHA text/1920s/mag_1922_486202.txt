is not to be expressed or symbolized by any super-personality . It manifests itself in slowly developing group-customs ; music holds its place among these . Thus is it possible for a national folk-music to arise . Because the composers of the nineteenth century have drawn their inspiration from the folk-music of their native lands , their music has shown marked divergences along national lines . The Russian peasantry , the most westerly of Eastern peoples , have a folk-music oriental in its characteristic rhythms and modes ; hence the music of Moussorgsky , Borodin , and Rimski ? Korsakoff reflects those exotic qualities . Chopin and the Wieniawskis are more Polish than individual . Moreover , England , the one European country that possesses no peasan  --  try , can boast of no national school of music . Indirectly also has the music of each nation been molded by the silent masses of its population . Several centuries of en  --  lightened musical interest has produced throughout Europe a musical organization that is almost institutional . Every peasant is an artist on some instrument that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little orchestra , often surprisingly skilled . The larger towns pos  --  sess institutes offering instruction of a high order . At each national capital there are conservatories presided over by mas  --  ters . Any child that shows marked talent is soon brought to the attention of his community , is trained , and returns to his village a musician of no mean order , or else seeks greater laurels in the metropolis of his country . Those who achieve distinction , who are hailed by the critics as the artists of the day , have been nurtured from infancy in the traditions of their national music . As children they sang the melodies of their village and played the masterpieces of the composers of their country in the local orchestra . In the conservatories this atmosphere persisted , and they emerged fitted and intent to preserve and transmit this tradition . Their music , based on airs and tunes of their native heaths , was the more acceptable to the audiences of their country , and the support accorded encouraged them to persist and develop in this direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  canons formulated by rotary clubs and civic leagues . It is the flowering of a plant whose roots are deeply imbedded in the submerged daily life of generations . This country has not yet had opportunity to develop nation  --  hood , and thereby attain a national music . It was only a few years ago that Horace Greeley was saying " Go West , young man . " The day of the westward-moving frontier is still within the memory of many of us . Even the East was not stable , for there was a steady ebbing of old-timers , while their places were taken to an extent by foreign peoples from European shores . Such flux could only be temporary , but the great ex  --  tent of the country to be settled made it of long duration . We are not fully past it yet and perhaps shall not be for sev  --  eral generations to come . There must still be shiftings , read  --  justments . Communal life in the European sense is almost unknown in this country , save among small groups of immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Conti  --  nental peasant knows his neighbor 's family for generations back , and the family of his neighbor 's wife . He is related to everyone in the village by blood or marriage , and he feels himself a part of his village . Hence his share in communal activities . It will take time for America to attain this stage . When each village has its little circle of artists devoting them  --  selves in comradely spirit at the same time to the masterpieces of chamber-music and the homely airs of the countryside ; when each town can show a musical director who has studied under the best masters , given his recital at Carnegie or Aeolian halls , discovered he is not of the few favored darlings of the muses , and then returned to his birthplace to serve faithfully in his smaller niche ; when our conservatories can look to their own people , instead of across the ocean , for models : then , perhaps , will a music truly American arise without prompting . When flux gives way to settlement and sons cultivate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich and varied rural folk-life that will find its musical expression , just as the already developed urban folk-life has laid the foundation for rag-time . There are two groups of the population which have remained unmoved by the migratory fever , the Southern Negroes and the relatively isolated Creole population of the lower Mississippi and the Gulf Basin , and from their already developed folk-life came inspiration for MacDowell and for the " New World Symphony . " At present our students , with few or no native traditions , must go abroad and absorb the culture of foreign environ  --  ments ; returning home , they attempt to create an alien music in this country . Only failure can result . Theirs is not the blame , for these disappointments are our necessary musical growing pains .

" Talented , intelligent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understand and admire it and read the innumerable learned commentators and give a per  --  formance that is graceful , correct , and scholarly at once . I do not know whether Mr. John Barrymore used the Furness Variorum Edition or not . It is certain that he had no need to do so . Other actors can act Hamlet ; he is Hamlet , the " prob  --  lematic nature , " the eternal concrete symbol in literature of the introvert , of him whose sensibilities are too delicate for the rough uses of the world , of him who , thinking too curiously and feeling too intensely , can not act , of him for whom life is too strong because his weakness is a higher strength and who is defeated because he can not be ignoble . Talent and intelligence and good-will , in brief , can not reach this role . It needs an inner kinship . I am not sure that I quite knew this until I saw John Barrymore in Hamlet . It can never be forgotten now . It was clear enough that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his characters . He always played with a touch of genius , but he played himself as Falder and Fedya and Richard III . Here , at last , the distance between himself and his creation has been eliminated . The identity of the two is complete . And because of that identity he has been able to understand and render the text with a consummate freshness . This freshness is very definitely in the verbal tex  --  ture of Shakespeare 's verse and prose . Again and again the mere intellectual grasp of a passage which both scholars and actors have long possessed is transmuted into the glow of living speech . Again and again one feels the stir and impact of words not said before , of words wrung from an immediate perception of the mind , an immediate experience of the heart . And it is needless to say that this complete revivifying of perhaps the most hackneyed dramatic text in the world bears witness to a controlled ardor , a patient passion that are of the essence of the noblest art . The key of this " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declamation has been permitted to remain . It is the key of fine modern poetry , of the finest modern fiction . There is no striv  --  ing or crying . The music is the music of the inevitable sadness of things . There is energy enough , but an energy curbed by a sense that violence is the least effectual of methods . There is a certain isolation of the tragic action . The court is not crowded ; the figures are few and pass by one another with a melancholy grace ; the rhythm is grave . The tragedy of blood is gone despite the statuesque dead of the last moment . What is heard , beyond the beautiful naturalness of all speech , is a poem con  --  cerning life and death and the fate of men . Only it is a true poem , a veracious poem , a poem that finds us , as Coleridge said of the Bible , at once . About Mr. Barrymore there is something at once fragile and burning . He is rarely obtrusive ; he is rarely emphatic . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a harsh and uncomprehended world . His voice is the voice of a thinker and poet , an interior voice which remains the voice of the soul even when the music of the verse is richly carried by it . His bearing and gestures have the restrained but intense expressive  --  ness of the bearing of modern men who live with their nerves and woes in narrow rooms . Yet they seem utterly right  --  right in an unsought-for and unhoped-for measure . And this illus  --  trates the truth that a supreme masterpiece is one that each suc  --  cessive age can interpret in the terms of its own moods and needs and special passions , if but the right interpreter be found . The marvelous freshness in the reading of the text , which is perhaps the most permanently notable thing about this produc  --  tion , has been communicated by either Mr. Barrymore himself or by the direction to the other players .
