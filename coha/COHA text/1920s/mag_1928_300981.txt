I often wonder what the <P> Vintners buy <P> One half so precious as the <P> Stuff they sell . <P> - Omar Khayyam <P> Among countries where wine is considered less precious than cash are France , Italy , Spain , Portugal , Luxembourg , Hungary , Tunis and Greece . <P> Covertly these nations have been perfecting means to sell more wine for more cash . Four years ago they signed not a secret but a very discreet treaty which became operative last year , establishing The International Wine Bureau , in Paris . Although the treaty was duly deposited with the League of Nations , it has never been officially printed . But perhaps its quasi-secret text came last summer under the eye of John Davison Rockefeller III , undergraduate grandson of John D. Rockefeller I , who worked during vacation as an information clerk at the Secretariat of the League of Nations ( TIME , July 16 ) , peered into many a document , and returned in September to Princeton-where even charladies know that the House of Rockefeller is firmly dry . <P> Scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issuance last " week by Ivy Lee &; Associates ( spokesoffice for the House of Rockefeller ) of an expos and privately made translation of the treaty establishing The International Wine Bureau . " Such a plan , " declared Ivy Lee &; Associates , " constitutes in effect an anti-prohibition campaign , at least in so far as the sale of wine is concerned . " <P> Scanners of the treaty thought it a slender theme for the exercise of Mr. Lee 's imposing talents . The Wine Bureau will merely attempt to develop the international wine trade , " in accordance with the laws of each country , " by releasing data " tending to demonstrate the beneficial effects of wine , " and by sponsoring laboratory experiments " to demonstrate the hygienic qualities of wine and its influence as an agent in the fight against alcoholism ( i.e. against " hard liquor " ) .
