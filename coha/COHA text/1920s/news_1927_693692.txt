txt A Motor Road Up Whiteface . In THE TiMes of April 3 there appeared an editorial commenting on a proposed constitutional amendment which , If passed . would permit the construction of an automobile road to the top of Whiteface Mountain to the Adirondacks . The writer of the editorial adopted what appears to me a rather ; narrow point of view . namely , that the very wonderful view from the top of the mountain should he restricted to those who climb the mountain on foot . I hare climbed Whiteface more than once , but the trail Is far from an easy one . It is suited only for the use of vigorous people , as many persons not of the rugged type who have attempted the climb can testify . Pikes Peak in Colorado has both a cog railroad and a motor road to the top , Mount Washington in New Hampshire has both means for reaching the top . Mount Mitchel in North Carolina and Lookout Mountain in Tennessee can also be reached by other means than pedal locomotion . The view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling on a cable car . and even the Matterhorn is now available to all n ho care to make the ascent on the railroad . Why should the beauty of the mountains . valleys and lakes of the Adirondacks be restricted to only those hardy and lucky individuals who climb Whiteface on a clear day ? When a motor road is constructed to the top of Whiteface not only will this view be available to thousands who live in or near that neighborhood , but also it can be seen by many thousands motoring through the Adirondacks in the Summer who have not , on their brief tours sufficient time to make the long climb up and back on foot , DELOS A.
