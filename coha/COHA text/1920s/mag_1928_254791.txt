Paris Bound . There have been since men and women started getting married an indefinite number of gravely ingenious arguments why " not " should be struck from the Seventh Commandment . Philip J. Q. Barry , able younger playwright , makes a happy marriage ; all but breaks it when this irritating monosyllable is overemphasized . In the last , lithe moments of his comedy the man and wife decide presumably to forgive and forget . <P> This man and this woman have hoards of money ; houses in the country ; smartly charming tricks of conversation ; and , as the play proceeds , two children . Also it has this man 's father who , as he sees it , has been done out of an eminently perfect marriage by a wife who indignantly divorced him for infidelity . He is bent on appeasing similar indignation in his daughter-in-law . <P> An evening of amiable conversation ; a genially drunken friend of the family ; a correct , quiet , cordial entertainment is the sum . Madge Kennedy plays prettily ; the father-in-law is Gilbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear a double breasted suit as though he owned it . Critics are generously delighted with Paris Bound . The title refers to the widening quota of comfortable Americans to whom the sea of matrimony is simply a broad Atlantic with French divorce courts at the voyage end . <P> Conspicuous in the cast was Mrs. R. Bartow Read , whose name and address are in the social register , amateur actress making an amusingly competent professional debut under her maiden name , Hope Williams . <P> Paradise . In a small Ohio town , life was miserable for Winnie Elder ; her family hated her because she was not married . Frantic , she went to New York . Proudly she returned in some months with the body of her husband in a coffin . An inquisitive aunt nosed out the news it was not her husband , but a body she bought at the morgue . Some potent playing by Lillian Foster did not suffice to make a rigidly effective whole . <P> Celebrity . The comedy of manners degenerates every so often into the comedy of " rackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad plane of society . Its characters are types , such as the midwives of Plantees and Oscar Wilde 's cookie-eaters . When audiences tire of types , satirists turn and flay contemporary figures in the professions . <P> Nowadays " racket " plays are pasted up by newspaper folk from clippings of their daily stint , with interpolations of plot and jargon which the newspapers know but would not dare print . Celebrity handles the prizefight " racket " with an intimacy that may annoy Fisticuffers Dempsey and Tunney . Of their characters , careers and managers , the Celebrity , " Barry Regan , " and his impressario , " ' Circus ' Snyder , " are licensed composites . Personal mannerisms alone are spared . As for the women the play involves , and the shady proposition of the big promoter , theatregoers can only conjecture how libelous Reporter-Playwright Willard Keefe has been in his notably entertaining effort to put the headlines behind the footlights .
