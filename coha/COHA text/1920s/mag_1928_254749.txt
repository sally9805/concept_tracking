From the cabinet of the Nanking " Nationalist Government " there resigned , last week , two leading statesmen : 1 ) - Foreign Minister Dr. C. C. Wu , who represented South China at the Paris Peace Conference ; and 2 ) Finance Minister Sun Fo , son of the late " sainted " Dr. Sun Yat-sen who founded the Nationalist movement . <P> Dr. Wu declared that he resigned because of " a sense of regret at my inability to accomplish anything . " The opinion was general that if so great a statesman can not work with his recent colleagues there will have to be a general reshuffle of the Cabinet when the Nationalist Party Congress shortly convenes in Nanking .
