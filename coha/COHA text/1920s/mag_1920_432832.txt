IN one of the most brilliant , subtle , and suggestive autobiographies ever written , Henry Adams informs us that he was never educated , and endeavors to explain why his varied attempts at education were abortive . He flings a trumpet challenge to the universe : Here am I , Henry Adams . I defy you to educate me . You can not do it . Apparently , by his own reiterated and triumphant declaration , the universe , after most humiliating efforts , could not . We should perhaps sympathize with the universe more perfectly , since Adams asks no sympathy , if , at the beginning of his narrative , or even in the middle of it , he told us what he means by education . This he never does with any completeness , though the word occurs more times than there are pages in the book . When he has advanced more than half-way through the story , he remarks casually that , for a mind worth educating , the object of education ' should be the teaching itself how to react with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as it goes ; but it is rather vague , it hardly seems to bear upon teeny of the attempted methods of education , and it does not reappear in any proportion to the demands upon it . I can not help thinking that if , in the beginning , the brilliant autobiographer had set himself sincerely and soberly to reflect upon the word he was to use so often , he would have saved himself much repetition and the universe some anxiety , though he would havedeprived his readers of a vast deal of entertainment . As it is , he pursues an illusory phantom through a world of interesting experiences . Probably a dozen times in the course of the book he tells us that Adams 's education was ended . But a few pages later the delightful task is taken up again , until one comes to see that to have been educated , really and finally , would have been the tragedy of his life . At any rate , nobody could furnish a prettier keynote for a psychograph than the motto , ' Always in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search through all its meanders of intellectual and spiritual experience . From birth in Boston in 1838 to death in Washington in 1918 , through America , Europe , and the rest of the world , through teaching and authorship and politics and diplomacy , through loveand friendship and the widest social contact , the curious and subtle soul , with or without the afterthought of education , pursued its complicated course , scattering showers of brilliancy about it , leaving memories of affection behind it , and however difficult to grasp in its passage and elusive in its product , always and everywhere unfailingly interesting . It is hardly necessary to say that , with this restless and unsatisfied spirit , the period which sees education finished for most men did not even see it begun . The infant who starts with the definition of a teacher as ' a man employed to tell lies to little boys ' isnot very likely to get definitive results from early schooling . The juvenile Adams surveyed Boston and Quincy and found them distinctly wanting , in his eyes , though not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or had o tiered and realized the best solution yet tried . The problem was worked out . ' But not for him . With Harvard College the results were little better . He fully understood that , - if social position counted , he ought to get all there was to be got . ' Of money he Adams , for the autobiography is sustained throughout in the third person had not much , of mind not more , but he could he quite certain that , barring his own faults , his social position would never be questioned . ' He was ready to admit also that failure , so far as there was failure , was owing precisely to faults of his own . ' Harvard College was a good school , but at bottom what the boy disliked most was any school at all . He did not want to be one in a hundred ? one per cent of an education . ' Furthermore , with the readiness we all have to acknowledge weaknesses we should not wish others to find in us , he declares that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judges always ranked him beneath a rival , if he had any ; and he believed the judges were right . ' But , at any rate , Harvard did not educate him . There was no cooperation , no coordination . Everybody stood alone , if not apart . ' It seemed a sign of force ; yet to stand alone is quite natural when one has no passions ; still easier when one has no pains . ' And the total outcome was forlornlyinadequate . ' Socially or intellectually , the college was for him negative and in some ways mischievous . The most tolerant man of the world could not see good in the lower habits of the students , but the vices were less harmful than the virtues . ' Nobody nowadays would anticipate that Germany could do what Harvard could not . But some persons then cherished amiable delusions . Young Adams hoped vaguely that Germany might educate him . With turns of phrase that recall Mark Twain he recognizes his happy moral fitness for education ? if he could get it . ' He seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he observed conventions , when he could not escape them ; he was never quarrelsome , towards a superior ; his morals were apparently good , and his moral principles , if he had any , were not known to be bad . ' On this admirable substructure even Germany , however , could not erect the desired edifice . Acting on the pompous encouragement of Sumner , who said to him , ' I came to Berlin , unable to say a word in the language ; and three months later , when I went away , I talked it to my cabman , ' Adams struggled with the difficulties of the German tongue and overcame them by methods of which he says that three months passed in such fashion would teach a poodle enough to talk with a cabman . ' But to one so exacting the mere learning of a language was not education , though it seems so to some people . The question was what you did with the language after you had learned it . And here Germany failed as egregiously as Boston . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the public schools was hopeless . The memory was made sodden and soggy by enormous burdens . ' No other faculty than the memory seemed to be recognized . Least of all was any use made of reason , either analytic , synthetic , or dogmatic . The German government did not encourage reasoning . ' The boys ' bodies were disordered by bad air and ill-adjusted exercise , and then ' they were required to prepare daily lessons that would have quickly broken - down strong men of a healthy habit , and which they could learn only because their minds were morbid . ' It was hardly likely that the university teaching would produce a more favorable impression . It did not . ' The professor mumbled his comments ; the students made , or seemed to make , notes ; they could have learned from hooks or discussion in a day more than they could learn from him in a month , but they must pay his fees , follow his course , and be his scholars , if they meted a degree . To an American the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving Germany , our student departed with a light heart and a firm resolution that , ' wherever else he might , in the infinities of space or time , seek for education , it should not be again in Berlin . ' Many earnest persons , who have found direct education for themselves fruitless and unprofitable , declare that they first began to learn when they began to teach , and that in the education of others they discovered the secret of their own . After a number of years of varied activity , Adams returned to Harvard as a teacher , and had an opportunity to test the truth of this principle . Viewed objectively , his work in instructing others seems universally commended . His pupils praised him , admired him , cherished a warm personal affection for him . He did not try to burden their memories , or to fill them with any theories or doctrines of his mi . He made them think , he put life into them , intellectual life , spiritual life . ' In what way Mr. Adams aroused my slumbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' writes Mr. Lodge ; ' but there can be no doubt of the fact . ' What greater function or service can a teacher perform than this ? But for the educator himself teaching was no more profitable than learning . He had a keen sense of the responsibilities of his task . ' A parent gives life , but , as parent , gives no more . A murderer takes life , but his deed stops there . A teacher affects eternity ; he can never tell where his influence stops . ' He knew his own vast ignorance , as his pupils did not know theirs . ' His course had led him through oceans of ignorance ; he had tumbled from one ocean into another . ' But the diffusion of ignorance , even conscientious , did not seem to him an object worth toiling for . Education as administered at Harvard and at similar institutions appeared to lead nowhere . The methods were wrong , the aims wrong , if there were any aims . That it educated scholars was very doubtful ; that it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that , of all his many educations , Adams thought that of school-teacher the thinnest . ' And how was it with society , with the wide and varied contact with men and women ? If ever man had the chance to be educated by this means , Henry Adams was the man . He met all sorts of people in all sorts of places ; met them intimately , not only at balls and dinners , but in unguarded hours around the domestic hearth . As with the teaching , others ' impression of him is enthusiastic . He was not perhaps the best of ' mixers ' in the American sense ; but he was kindly , gracious , sympathetic , full of response , full of stimulation , full of sparkling and not domineering wit . When he and Mrs. Adams kept open house in Washington , it was well said of them , ' Nowhere in the United States was there then , or has there since been , such a salon as theirs . Sooner or later , everybody who possessed real quality crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' To his intimates ? and these included women of wit and charm and distinction ? the hours spent in his study or at his table were the best that Washington could give . ' But , as with the teaching , the man 's own view of his general human relations is less satisfactory . The play of motives is interesting , certainly ; but what can he learn from it , what can it do for his education ? ' All that Henry Adams ever saw in man was a reflection of his own ignorance . ' The great obstacle for sensitive natures to all social pleasure , the immense intrusion of one 's self , was always present to him , never entirely got rid of . ' His little mistakes in etiquette or address made him writhe with torture . ' And of one concrete , tormenting incident , " This might seem humorous to some , but to him the world turned ashes . ' The annoyances were great and the compensations trifling . Though he touched many hands , heard many voices , looked deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dream solitude . When he was in Cambridge , he bewailed the isolation of professors . ' All these brilliant men were greedy for companionship , all were famished for want of it . ' But the greed and the want haunted him everywhere . I do not see that they were ever satisfied . With women he fared somewhat bettor than with men , and few men have been more frank about acknowledging their debt to the other sex . ' In after life he made a general law of experience ? no woman had ever driven him wrong ; no man had ever driven him right . ' And at all times and on all occasions he paid his debt with abundance of praise , tempered , of course , with such reserve as was to be expected from one who had all his life been seeking education and had not found it . To be sure , he readily admits entire ignorance as to the character , motives , and purposes of womankind . ' The study of history is useful to the historian by teaching him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance crushes one who is familiar enough with what are called historical sources to realize how few women have ever been knave ' But such admission of ignorance , especially for one who triumphed in ignorance on all subjects , only made it easier to recognize and celebrate the charm . One could trifle with the ignorance perpetually , elaborate it , and complicate it , till it took the form of the most exquisite comprehension . " The proper study of mankind is woman ' and , by common agreement since the time of Adam , is the most complex and arduous . ' Was it a question of the woman of America ? One could write novels , like Esther and Democracy , in which the woman of America is made a miracle of cleverness and is at any rate more rod than anything else . Or , in intimate table-talk with great statesmen and their wives , one could calmly insist that the American man is a failure . Yon are all failures .. . . Would n't , we all elect Mrs. Lodge Senator against Cabot ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Roosevelt ran against him ? ' But unquestionably one treads safer ground and is less exposed to the temptation of irony , if one goes back five hundred years and adores the Virgin of Chartres . With her , as Mark Twain found with Joan of Arc , one can elevate the feminine ideal to a Gothic sublimity , without too inconvenient intrusion of harsh daylight . When we reduce these abstract personal contacts to concrete individuality , we find , or divine , Adams at his best , at his most human . ' Friends are born , not made , and Henry never mistook a friend . ' For all his vast acquaintance , these friendships were not many , and they seem to have been deep and true and lasting . To be sure , he complains that politics is a dangerous dissolvent here as elsewhere . ' A friend in power is a friend lost . ' But his love for Hay and for Clarence King , not to speak of others , was evidently an immense element in his emotional life , and if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more difficult and vastly better , made him forget it . Moreover , as is indicated in : qrs . LaFarge 's charming study of her uncle , there was a peculiar tenderness in Adams 's intimate personal relations , very subtle , very elusive , very delicate , but very pervading . As is the case with many shy and self-contained natures , the tenderness showed most in his contact with children . But he had , further , a peculiar gift , by his imaginative sympathy , of eliciting affectionate confidences from young and old . To what we may assume to have been the deepest love of all Adams himself makes not the faintest reference . His wooing and marriage are not once mentioned in the Education , but are lost in the shadowy twenty years which he passes over with a word . tome dream-attachments of early childhood are touched with delicate sarcasm . Beyond this , love as a personal matter does not enter into his wide analysis . From the comments of others we infer that , although he had no children , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more than most marriages do , while his wife 's death brought him deep and abiding sorrow . But we may safely conclude that marriage did not give him that mysterious will-o ' - the wisp , education , since , after Mrs. Adams 's death , we find him seeking it as restlessly and as unprofitably as ever . So , leaving traced his search through the complicated phases of the more personal side of life , let us follow it in the even more complicated development of the intelligence . It would seem as if few human callings could afford a wider basis for education in the broadest sense than diplomacy , and Adams had the advantage of all that diplomacy could offer . His father cared for the interests of the Union in London all through the fierce strain of the Civil War , and Henry , as his father 's secretary , saw the inside working of mens ' hearts and passions which that strain carried with it . He watched everything curiously , gained a fascinating insight into the peculiarities of English statesmanship , drew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell , Gladstone , and other figures , some of whom are not soon to be forgotten and some are forgotten already . He sketched with a sure and vivid touch scenes of historic or human significance . Saint-Simon could not have done them better . But as to education for himself , the private secretary got nothing . In fact , these repeated , progressive , futile efforts seemed only to be carrying bins beyond zero into the forlorn region of negative quantity . He found out that he was incurably shy , reserved , unfitted for theobtrusive contlictsof life . He tells us somewhere that he never had an enemy or a quarrel . But without quarrels one does not win many victories , even in the courteous atmosphere of diplomacy . The result of his English experience tended to little but the total derision and despair of the lifelong effort for education . ' With practical politics at home in America it was the same . Only here Adams , warned by varied observation of others , made no attempt himself at decision on matters that can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all politicians , was quite impossible for him , let alone the lightning facility in changing such decisions which gives the fine finish to a successful politician 's career . He had the true conservative 's dislike of innovation , not because he was satisfied with things as they are , but because he had a vast dread of things as they might be . The risk of error in changing a long-established course seems always greater to me than the chance of correction , unless the elements are known more exactly than is possible in human affairs . ' But if he did not seek education ? where some think it is most surely to be found ? in intense personal action , at least he was never tired of observing the complexities and perplexities of American political life . And if these did not give him education , they gave him amusement , as they give it to his readers in his interpretation of them . His own conclusion as to the workings of American government was not enthusiastic . Cabinets were timid , congresses were helter-skelter , presidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one could not be sure that they were always well-intentioned . What wonder that the outcome of observation so dispassionate was hardly educative for the observer . It certainly is not for his readers , except in the sense of disillusionment . From the hard , harsh , clear-cut do-. ings of practical America the inquiring , acquiring spirit naturally turned at times to vaguer portions of the world ; set itself to discover whether education might not come from travel and pure receptivity , since it absolutely refused to emanate from the strenuous action of common life . The results , if hardly more satisfactory , were always diverting . Rome ? Oh , the charm of Rome ! But it could not well be a profitable charm . ' One 's personal emotions in Rome . . . must be hurtful , else they could not have been so intense . ' And again , Rome was ' the last place under the sun for educating the young ; yet it was , by common consent , the only spot that the young ? of either sex and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' It might be supposed that at least travel would break up conservatism , abolish fixed habits of thought and life , supple the soul as well as the limbs , and make it more quickly receptive of innovation and experiment . Not with this soul , which found itself even more distrustful of change abroad than at home . ' The tourist was the great conservative who hated novelty and adored dirt . ' Such a result might perhaps be expected from wandering in the Far East , where the flavor of dreamy repose , whether in man or nature , infect. ed everything . But one would have thought that the bright , crystal , spark . ling atmosphere of the American West might animate , enliven , induce a brisker courage and a more adventurous effort at existence . Taken beyond middle age , however , it did not induce effort , but only restlessness . ' Only a certain intense cerebral restlessness survived , which no longer responded to sensual stimulants ; one was driven from beauty to beauty as though art were a trotting-match . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire ardor , it ens not to be imagined that the gloomy silences of the Arctic Circle would de it . They did not ; they merely fed far-reaching , profound , and futile reflection on the battle of modern practical science with the old , dead , dumb , withering forces of nature . An installation of electric lighting and telephones led tourists close up to the polar ice-cap . beyond the level of the magnetic pole : and there the newer Teufelsdrttckh sat dumb with surprise and glared at the permanent electric lights of Hammer . fest . ' From all this vast peregrination the conclusion is that the planet offers hardly a dozen places where an elderly man can pass a week alone without ennui , and none at all where he can pass a year . ' Was it better with the wanderings of the spirit than with those of the flesh ? Let us see . How was it with art , the world 's wide , infinitely varied , inexhaustible human product of beauty ? Surely no man ever had better opportunity to absorb and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Yet Adams 's references to the influence of art in general are vague and obscure . He can indeed multiply paradox on that , as on any subject , indefinitely . Tor him , only the Greek , the Italian or the French standards had claims to respect , and the barbarism of Shakespeare was as flagrant as to Voltaire ; but his theory never affected his practice . . . he read his Shakespeare as the Evangel of conservative Christian anarchy , neither very conservative nor very Christian , but stupendously anarchistic . ' But tried by the one final , ever-repeated test , all that art offers is about as unsatisfactory as American politics or tropical dreams . ' Art was a superb field for education , but at every turn he met the same old figure , like a battered and illegible signpost that ought to direct him to the next station but never did . ' One phase only of the vast outpouring of artistic beauty did engage the curious student , did for the time distract him wholly , involve and entangle his restless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has analyzed so fully in Mont St. Michel and Chartres . The strange glamour , the puzzling and elusive suggestion and intimation of Gothic architecture , the complex subleties of Christian thought and feeling , as illustrated and illuminated by that architecture , seem to have held him with an almost inexpli cable charm ; and the insinuating , absorbing , dominating figure of the Blessed Virgin , lit at once and shadowed by the glimmering glory of old , unmatchable stained windows , gave him something ? at least offered him the tantalizing image of something ? that modern thought and modern wit and modern companionship could never supply . Yet even here the final impression is that of remoteness and unreality . What can a living soul get from a dead religion ? ' The religion is as dead as Demeter , and its art alone survives as , OR the whole , the highest expression of man 's thought or emotion . ' Even to feel the art , you have to make yourself other than you are ; and modern nerves , unstrung by the wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Any one can feel it who will only consent to feel like a child . . . . Any one willing to try could feel it like the child , reading new thought without end into the art he has studied a hundred times ; but , what is still more convincing , he could at will , in an instant , shatter the whole art by calling into it a single motive of his own . ' So we must infer that the charm of this medieval interlude was largely owing to its remoteness , to the very fact that it was a world of dream and only dream , requiring of the visitor none of the vulgar positive action demanded by twentieth-century Washington . And the very remoteness that made the charm took it away ; for souls of the twentieth century must live in the twentieth century , after all . No one lived in it more energetically than Adams , so far as mere thinking was concerned . To turn from his intimate acquaintance with medieval learning to his equally intimate contact with the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth seized upon the theories of Darwin , twisted them , teased them , tormented them , to make them furnish the vanishing specific which he believed himself to be eternally seeking . They did not satisfy him . As time went on , he found that they did not satisfy others , and he plunged more deeply and more widely into others ' dissatisfaction in order to confirm his own . The patient erudition of Germany , the logical vivacity of France , the persistent experimenting of England , all interested him , and from all he turned away as rich ? and as poor ? as he set out . No one has more gift than he at making scientific speculations attractive , alive , at giving them almost objective existence , so that you seem to be moving , not among quaint abstractions of thought , but among necessary realities ? perverse , persistent creatures that may make life worth living or not . He embodies theory till it tramps the earth . He treats the pterodactyl and the ichthyosaurus with the same intimate insolence as a banker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzes the weaknesses of terebratula with as much pride as those of his grandfather . Yet , when you reflect , you think yourself at liberty to feel a little discontent with him , since he admits so much with others . His exposition of all these scientific questions is brilliant , paradoxical , immensely entertaining . But no one makes you perceive more clearly the difference between brilliancy and lucidity . In mild , steady sunlight you can work out your way with plodding confidence ; but a succession of dazzling flashes only makes darkness more intolerable . Adams can double the weight of unsolved problems upon you . He can not , at least he rarely does , even state a problem with consistent , clear , orderly method , much less follow out the long solution of one . His most instructive effort in this line is the Letter to American Teachers of History Here are two hundred pages of glitter . ing pyrotechnic . You read it , and are charmed and excited and shocked , and left breathless at the end . What is the tangible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely doubtful whether mankind has progressed within the limits of recorded history , or ever will progress or do anything but retrograde , and that this famous discovery makes the teaching of history extremely difficult . Well , it is another difficulty , certainly , if the discovery is correct , which Adams would be the last to affirm with positiveness . But it might have been stated in a few words , instead of being amplified and complicated with endless repetition , all the more puzzling for its brilliancy . And among the manifold serious troubles of a teacher of history this one almost disappears , from its very remoteness . Of the far more pressing difficulties , of treatment , of method , of practical interest , Adams discusses not a single one . I doubt if any teachei of history ever laid down the Letter with the feeling that he had been helped in any possible way . Of the more abstract metaphysical thinking that fills the latter portions of the Education and of Mont St. Michel , the same may be said as of the science . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical intelligence from Aristotle to Spencer is touched upon , with an especially long stop at Saint Thomas Aquinas , to sum up and crystallize the whole . At first one is humbly impressed , then one is bewildered , then one becomes slightly skeptical . The result of it all seems too fluid , evanescent . Take the mysterious theory of acceleration . Through various preparatory chapters we are apparently led up to this . Suddenly we find that we have passed it , and we rub our eyes . The truth is , when analyzed , that the theory of acceleration means that the nineteenth century moved rather faster than the thirteenth . But surely there needs no ghost from the Middle Ages to tell us that . Nor does Adams 's latest philosophical work , The Rule of Phase Applied to History , improve matters much , though the idea of acceleration is further developed in it . The argument here is condensed after a fashion that would seem naturally to interfere with its lucidity . But when one reflects upon such a tangle of misleading analogies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made the lack of lucidity more apparent . And we are forced to conclude , with the metaphysics , as with the science , that the thinking is more stimulating than satisfying , more brilliant than profound . There is an acute , curious , far-reaching , unfailing interest . There is not systematic , patient , logical , clarifying order and method . Also , with the lack of method , there is another spiritual defect , perhaps even more serious . The exposition of all these high philosophical ideas is more paradoxical than passionate ; and the reason is that the thinker himself had not passion , had not the intense , overpowering earnestness which alone gives metaphysical speculations value , if not for their truth , at any rate for their influence . No doubt , something of the impression of dillettantism is due to the inheritance of New England reserve which Adams never entirely shook off . But the defect goes deeper ; and , in spite of his brother 's assurance to the contrary , one can not help feeling that Henry usually approaches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused curiosity . One must not take passages like the following too seriously , ? and one must realize that years and suffering some- what modified the flippancy of youth , ? but one must take them seriously enough . ' Henry Adams was the first in an infinite series to discover and admit to himself that he really did not care whether truth was , or was not , true . He did not even care that it should be proved true , unless the process were new and amusing . He was a Darwinian for fun . ' As to the last and most practical of all these varied spiritual attempts at education , the attempt ? and the achievement ? of authorship , one 's conclusion is much as with the others . The novels , the biographies , above all the History of the United States , are among the most brilliant productions of their time . They glitter with epigrams and dazzle with paradoxes and puzzle with new interpretations , and make one think as one has rarely thought about the problems of American life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important and the most enduring . It is fascinating in parts , almost abnormally entertaining in parts , yet even in the History , as a whole , there is a lack of broad , structural conception , a tendency to obscure large movement by detail , sometimes diverting and sometimes tedious . Moreover , I can not help feeling the defect in Adams 's authorship that I feel in his general thinking , although authorship was the most serious interest of his life . He spent days in dusty muniment rooms , fortified his pages with vast labor and consistent effort , tried his bestto make himself and others think that he was an earnest student of history . Yet , after all his labor and all his effort , I at least can not escape the impression that he was an author for fun . ' It is precisely in this lack of seriousness that I find the clue to the failure of Adams 's whole colossal search for education , so far as the education was anything tangible and even the search was in any way serious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commendable reserve with which he tells his story . Both his brother and his niece insist upon his extreme shyness and reluctance to intrude his own experiences . But , after all , reserve is rather out of place in confessions so free and intimate as those of the Education ; and through all reserve the exposure of the inner , the inmost , life is sufficiently complete to show that the perpetual demand for education was at all times fatal to any absorbing ecstasy . When he was a boy in college , his elders remarked that one of his compositions was notable for lack of enthusiasm . ' The young man ? always in search of education ? asked himself whether , setting rhetoric aside , this absence of enthusiasm was a defect or a merit . ' Whichever it was , it accompanied him always and is the main key to his vast , absorbing work . What shall be said of a man who , in recounting his own life up to thirty , makes no single mention of having his pulses stirred , of being hurled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or poetry , or God ? What can any education be that is not built on some tumultuous experience of one or all of these ? Take nature . In Adams 's later life there are touches that show that nature must always have had its hold on him . When he returns from Europe in the late sixties , he finds ' the overpowering beauty and sweetness of . the Maryland autumn almost unendurable for its strain on one who had toned his life down to the November grays and browns of northern Europe . ' Yet note even here that it is the unendurable side of passion and ecstasy that clings . And the same sense of superiority and willful indifference peers through his wonderful rendering of later natural experi- ences . ' In the long summer days one found a sort of saturated green pleasure in the forests , and gray infinity of rest in the little twelfth-century churches that lined them . ' So with art . We have seen that he was entranced with the Middle Ages , and we have guessed that this was precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . At any rate , there is no evidence anywhere that he was wrapt or carried away by any other art whatever , either the sculpture of Greece , or the painting of the fifteenth century or the nineteenth . ' All style are good which amuse , ' he says . The Gothic and the Virgin amused him . When the sense of Beethoven 's music first overwhelms him , he describes this sense in a fashion intensely characteristic , as ' so astonished at its own existence , that he could not credit it , and watched it as something apart , accidental , and not to be trusted . ' ( Italics mine . ) With poetry it is the same . His niece tells us that he was passionately fond of poetry . ' I should have taken ' curiously fond ' to he nearer the mark . In any event , the fondness does not appear in his writings . He enlarges at huge length upon the epic and lyric productions of the Middle Ages . Except for semi elaborate analyses of Petrarch ? ana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Life of George Cabot Lodge , the poetry of the world might never have existed , for all the account his education takes of it . I have before recognized that his utter failure to deal with the educative power of human love may be owing to a delicacy that we are bound to respect . But surely the love of God might be handled without kid gloves . Adams hardly handles it with or without them . Of course , in such an extensive syllabus of non-education God has his place , with pteraspis and terebratula , and is treated with the same familiarity as those distant ancestors , and the same remoteness . Adams also insists that ' Religion is , or ought to be , a feeling ' ( italics mine ) , and in many pages of Mont St. Michel he shows an extraordinary power of entering into that feeling by intellectual analysis . But when he seeks for the feeling in himself , the result is much what he describes when he seeks it in the religious press of the world about him . ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ void , whether any large fraction of society cared for a future life , or even for the present one , thirty years hence . Not an act , or an expression , or an image , showed depth of faith or hope . ' As a factor in education , God counted for little more than terebratula . The truth is , that in this infinitely reiterated demand for education there is something too much of the egotism which Henry Adams inherited from his distinguished great-grandfather and which had not been altogether dissipated by the intermixture of two generations of differing blood ; it being always understood , as has been often illustrated , that egotism is perfectly compatible with shyness , reserve , and even self-effacement . In the preface to his autobiography Adams points out that the great lesson of Rousseau to the autobiographer is to beware of the Ego . In consequence Adams himself conscientiously avoids the pronoun ' I , ' and writes of his efforts and failures in the third person . As a result , it appears to me that the impression of egotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmless habit of the ' 1 ' ; but to have Henry Adams constantly obtruding Henry Adams produces a singular and in the end singularly exasperating effect . One can not help asking , what does it matter to the universe if even an Adams is not educated ? What does it matter if fifty years of curious experience leave him to conclude that ' He seemed to know nothing ? to be groping in darkness ? to be falling forever in space ; and the worst depth consisted in the assurance , incredible as it seemed , that no one knew more ' ? Not that one does not sympathize fully with the admission of ignorance . The best and the wisest , the most earnest and the most thoughtful , admit it likewise . The vast acceleration in knowledge of which Adams complained is the distinguishing feature of the twentieth century . We are swamped , buried , atrophied in the accumulation of our own learning . The specialist is the only relic of old wisdom that survives , and the specialist is but a pale and flickering torch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here it is Adams 's attitude that is unsatisfactory , not his conclusions . He proclaims that his life is spent in an effort to seek education ; but one can not escape an impression that he is not very eager to find it . He bewails the overwhelming burden of ignorance that descends upon him ? appears to bewail it ; but one can not help feeling that his grief is largely rhetorical , and that , so long as ignorance enables him to gild a phrase or turn an epigram , Ile can forgive it . He mixed himself up in the tangle of ideas until he achieved a sort of Paradise of ignorance vastly consoling to his fatigued senses . ' True ignorance approaches the infinite more nearly than any amount of knowledge can do . ' When a student so much enjoys trifling with the difficulties of his education , he is not likely to make very rapid progress in overcoming them . Simple and quiet as Adams himself was in his daily life , the thing he most mistrusted , intellectually and spiritually , was simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to teach the extreme complexity of extreme simplicity ; but one could have learned this from a glow-worm . ' Again : This seemed simple as running water ; but simplicity is the most deceitful mistress that ever betrayed man . ' And he disliked simplicity because it was the key to all his difficulties , as he himself perfectly well knew . He spent his life tramping the world for education ; but what lie really needed was to be de-educated , and this also he was quite well aware of . He needed not to think , but to live . But he did not want to live . It was easier to sit back and pro ? laim life unworthy of Henry Adams than it was to lean forward with the whole soul in a passionate , if inadequate , effort to make Henry Adams worthy of life . Mary Lyon would have seemed to this wide seeker for education very humble and very benighted ; but all Mary Lyon cared to teach her pupils was that they should live for God and do something . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she might have simplified his problem , though she would have rob . bed the world of many incomparable phrases . An even higher ? and humbler ? authority than Mary Lyon declared that we must become as little children if we would enter the kingdom of heaven . Perhaps the end of the twentieth century will take this as the last word of education , after all .
