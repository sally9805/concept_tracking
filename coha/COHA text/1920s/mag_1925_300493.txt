Another business man goeth into politics-Evans Woollen , Indianapolis Bank President-a man to whom President Wilson offered a place on the Federal Reserve Board ; who is Chairman of the Economic Policy Committee of the American Bankers ' Association ; who is or has been chairman , president or director of a railway , a life insurance company , any number of charitable and welfare associations , a college , an historical society , an art association , a fuel administration and memorials ranging from Benjamin Harrison to James Whitcomb Riley . He is besides a Democrat , and once ran for Congress-in 1896 on the Gold Democratic ticket . Last week he announced : <P> " I shall be a candidate for the Democratic nomination to succeed Senator Robinson . Wishing not to press myself on the party , I shall make no canvass for the nomination . If nominated , however , I will give all my strength eagerly in an effort to be elected . " <P> And Mr. Woollen is not to be suspected of rushing rashly in where politicians fear to tread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominated an excellent chance of being elected by reason of division in the Republican ranks , for there are at least three if not four Republicans who will want to try to get Indiana 's two Senate seats next year : Senator Watson , Senator Arthur R. Robinson , ex-Senator Beveridge and Governor Ed . Jackson .
