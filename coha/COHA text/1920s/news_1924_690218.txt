txt With the opening of debate in the Senate on the bonus veto , set for tomorrow , Administration leaders were gaining more confidence tonight that the President 's action would be sustained . Reports of reversals by Senators on the bonus are reaching them . It was said that Senator Watson of Indiana , who voted for the bill , would side with the President provided the vote on the veto message was reached before he must leave for his home to attend the Republican State Convention . The feeling exists among the antibonus leaders that there will be enough reversals to , sustain the President , provided the vote is not forced tomorrow . If it can be postponed for a week . Administration advisers say the reaction in the country consequent upon the President 's message , will be powerful enough to land enough Senators who voted for bonus to sustain the veto . The number of absentees when the vote is finally taken will be a vital bearing on the result . ' At least four , and perhaps five . Senators , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be present to vote . The four are La Follette , Lenroot , McCormick and Couzens , and some add Stanley . Should they not appear nor obtain . pairsitbis .. will cut down the number of votes the President 's supporters have to muster to gain the requisite votes above onethird . Senator Greene of Vermont , who favors sustaining the veto , is anxious to cast his vote in support of the President 's action . At his hotel tonight it was stated that it has not yet been decided whether he would be able to attend the session when the vote is taken . Senator Greene was shot several months ago in the head by a stray bullet fired while prohibition agents were chasing ? bootleggers in Washington , and for some days was thought at the point of death . His recovery has been almost miraculous . He is able to go out doors now but has not yet attended sessions of the Senate . Hope to Force a Postponement . Administration leaders are hopeful that they will be able to force a postponement on the veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notified the Senate yesterday he would do . President Coolidge , while not certain that the Senate will sustain his veto , is still hopeful that It will do so . On the other hand , the President is encouraged by the hundreds of letters and telegrams which have been received congratulating him on the arguments ho used in vetoing the bonus bill . There appears every reason to believe that the President will be compelled to veto the tax bill , now in conference , if the bonus bill becomes a law over his veto . Therefore , those Senators who are looking forward and seeing things in a broad way economically and politically are realizing that they can serve their own interests and that of their constituents better by reversing themselves on the bonus and assuring a tax bill which will bring direct reduction in taxes and decrease in the cost of living . The fight against tax exempt securities will be renewed in the Senate if the conferees in charge of the tax reduction bill become deadlocked and return to House and Senate for instructions , which now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who offered the original amendment preventing future issue of tax-free securities , said today he would again press It whenever the parliamentary status of the bill gave him the opportunity . The amendment , which provided that interest from future Issues of tax exempt securities should be included In gross income , was defeated In the Senate after a long debate in which the constitutionality of the proposal was attacked . This was combated by Senator Reed , who insisted that the Courts would sustain his amendment . ' " The process of issuing tax-exempt securities must stop or there will be no tax paid by wealthy men under the Income Tax act , " said Senator Reed . " I realize the unfairness of making my amendment retroactive , and that is why I drew it So as not to reach the 12,000,000,000 of tax exempts now outstanding . It seems to me that the question of taxing future issues of such securities really is a test of the sincerity of Congress in the high surtax rates which it has established .
