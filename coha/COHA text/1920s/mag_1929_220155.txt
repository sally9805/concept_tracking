The Octoroon . Hissing the villain and shouting directions to the hero came back into vogue with the revival of After Dark a few months ago , at Christopher Morley 's Theatre in Hoboken ( see above ) . This is another by the author of After Dark . Dragged from its pre-war ( Civil ) dust and presented on Broadway , its thunderous plot is played " straight " by a capable cast . For those who can get enjoyment out of making fun of abandoned sentimentalities , it provides a pleasant evening . <P> Spring Is Here . In the spring an old man 's fancy turns to musical comedy . Here is the first robin , flying in to music provided by Richard Rodgers . In addition it has intelligent lyrics by Lorenz Hart and a book by that oldtime craftsman , Owen Davis , who makes up with situations what amusement he fails to supply in the conversation . Not the least in importance is its cast : Glenn Hunter , making his musical debut after years in adolescent " drama " roles ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Charles Ruggles , an able farceur ; Lillian Taiz , whose voice is uncommonly good ; Joyce Barbour , who is not given nearly enough to do ; and Cy Landry , a dancing droll . <P> Young Alexander . The business of translating ancient idols for modern idlers is not new . John Erskine and Robert Emmet Sherwood have taken the edge off the novelty . It would seem that Hardwick Nevin had moments of realizing all this while he was writing his play about Alexander the Great , for he abandons the modern idiom from time to time in his treatment and launches forth into high-sounding blank verse . The result is confusion . Neither young Alexander nor the audience get anywhere . <P> The story itself is equally divided between fact and fable . That part of it which has historic basis deals with the young monarch 's campaign against Darius and the Persians . To this the playwright had added a faintly Freudian obsession on Alexander 's part for Helen of Troy , and fulfillment in the arms of Darius 's young and neglected wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hull and A. E. Anson , who might have made a very fine play of it hadthe author everdecided what he wanted to say . <P> The Town 's Woman . There is a real horse-race on the treadmill which once played so important a part in Ben Hur ; there is an aviator for women who are still pining over Col. Lindbergh ; there is a mean old bond-dealer , and a self-sacrificing heroine , and a waitress in trouble ; there is enough plot for six plays ; there are two intermissions and , at long last , a final curtain . But it all looks like another misfortune for the new Craig Theatre .
