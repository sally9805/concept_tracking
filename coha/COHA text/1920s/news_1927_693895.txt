txt The people of Paris had , their first real chance to show their joyous admiration for Captain Charles A. Lindbergh today and they certainly took advantage of it . At least half a million men , women and children , freed from the every-day cares if life by the Ascension Day holiday , lined the three miles of streets through which the modest young airman , accompanied by Ambassador Herrick and the President of the Municipal Council , drove to the Hotel de Ville for the city 's official reception . Leaving the embassy just before 3 o'clock , and preceded by the magnificent Guard of the Republic , Lindbergh 's motor moved slowly down the Champs Elysees , through the historic Place de la Concorde past the monument marking the execution of Louis XVI , and then into the more densely populated districts of Paris along the Rue de Rivoli to the City Hall . Recalls Tribute to Wilson . Not since the day when President Wilson passed along the identical route and was received with almost religious fervor by the populace enjoying the peace won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare with today 's spontaneous and heartfelt tribute . It - vas a genuine ovation for the Middle Western youth from beginning to end , and further to accentuate their feelings the same crowd , joined by many thousar.ds of others  --  some say as , high as a million people in all  --  waited an hour and a half to get another look as he drove back to the embassy with the city 's gold medal , rarely bestowed , in his pocket . Every available policeman in Paris , augmented by thousands of municipal and Republican Guards , was mobilized to prevent a repetition of the near tragedy on Le Bourget Field last Saturday night when the lone aviator was nearly crushed to death by the frantid thousands , but the 35,000 people packed like sardines around the City Hall broke these strong police lines by sheer force of numbers and almost swept Lindbergh 's motor car off the ground . Only the quick work of the mounted guards , who charged the crowds , prevented the enthusiasm of the people from again menacing the seemingly frail young man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certainly he did not show it . Every one naturally wanted to shake hands with him . That is why they , broke the line . But the aviator , with ? his everpresent good sense , realized that a single handshake would be the signal for a thousand mere , so he only , smiled and acknowledged the hornage of the crowd with his now famous two-finger salute  --  a graceful movement of the third and fourth fingers of the right hand . He began his day as he has begun all of them in Paris , with a big American breakfast , and at 9:30 o'clock paid his visit to Marshal Foch . The former Commander-inChief of the allied armies , with Mme. Foch at his side , greeted Lindbergh at the door as he entered , and with outstretched hand , said : " Young man , France and the whole world applauds your exploit . It proves that to the young man anything is possible if he takes the pains to prepare for it . " The Marshal 's indefatigable aide , Captain L'Hopital , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accent , interpreted the animated conversation that followed . Lindbergh , with all the interest of a boy , was deeply engrossed with the Marshal 's wonderful collection of war souvenirs and the Marshal was highly pleased when he found that Lindbergh was quick to recognize the American Distinguished Service badge , which he had purposely placed on the lapel of his coat . " You have a great French decoration , " he said , " but I have the honor of possessing a coveted American decoration . " Autographs a Photograph . Before Lindbergh left the Marshal signed one of his photographs with these words : " To the brave and heroic Lindbergh . " With a broad smile he handed it to him , saying : " This is not the portrait of a pretty girl , but it is the portrait of a true friend . " An amusing incident marked the close of the meeting between Lindbergh and Foch . While posing together for fifty photographers , the Marshal turned to Lindbergh and said : " Come right next me and stand very straight , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . " Lindbergh blushed to the roots of his hair and instead crouched down as far as he could so he would not be noticeably taller than Foch . Stops to See War Wounded . On the way home Lindbergh stopped at the Invalides , where a large group of mutilated Belgian soldiers , now on a visit to Paris , had assembled with their French c ' mrades , who also bear cruel marks of the war . Prominent in this pathetic group were disabled aviators , among them Duthion and Solignac , whose faces have been practically remade by the miracle of plastic surgery . Lindbergh shook hands with many , but by these two men he appeared deeply moved . He explained that although a boy when the war was on he had come since to realize what it meant and wanted humbly to express his own admiration for the heroic part these men played . General Mariaux , who presented the invalids , said : " The heroes of the war salute the hero of the air . " Then with that thoughtfulness which characterizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshal Joffre , father of the French Army and the hero of the Marne . The old Marshal was highly pleased that the young man cold find a moment in his hectic program for him . " I visited the United States in 1917 , " said the Marshal , " and I am very happy to receive a visit now from you who have flown from that great country . All of France is happy in your success , and no one r joices more than our soldiess who fought side by side with your soldiers in the war . " Then at noon Foreign Minister Briand , despite the present European anxiety over the Anglo-Russian diplomatic break , found time to entertain Lindbergh at an impressive luncheon at the Quai d'Orsay . Here assembled a brilliant array of diplomats , including Mr. Herrick and Paul Claudel. the new Ambassador to Washington . Society Girls Get Peep at Him . At the Interallied Club today social and cosmopolitan Paris had a chance to greet Lindbergh . They did it with as much enthusiasm as the populace and with scarcely less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls of Parisian society climbed upon the chairs and tables in the gardens of the club and stood tiptoe to have one peep . Brave and great men pushed with as much insistence as fish porters of the markets to get a better view . Even there the excitement and interest came within an ace of larking in good manners , and a posse of police was brought into the private garden of the club in case they might be needed . They were not , and this most feted of all young heroes was able to have a glass of orange juice sitting down , faced by Marshal Foch and Ambassador Herrick , in something like comparative peace , if one excepts the necessity of having to sign some twenty or thirty invitation cards . After that number he raised his hand in remonstrance , and even the girls fell back and left him to min his well-earned drink .. But he had 6 make a speech . I. in commemoration , Mars ial F-44,14 prcsented him wit . ' a large gold plaque struck in honor of the Lafayette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loved those birds of the war which your great country sent us , " he said . " They came and fought here with beak and talon . Many of them fell fighting . You came as a bird of peace , bringing a new peace , a greater peace , an everlasting peace and love between our countries . " Makes Another Brief Speech . With that pleasant smile which women say " is like the Prince of Wales 's , " young Lindbergh thanked him for the memorial and for his compliments . " They loved France and Paris , those birds of the war , just as I do , " he said . " But 1 would love it even more if I could go around and see it without having to make a speech every place I go . Of my flight , I can only repeat what I have said , it seems , many times before  --  that I am sure my plane is just the first swallow of a great migration which within a few years will be going back and forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other in every way . " One litt:e incident of the day which marks the lad was seen when he left the Quai d'Orsay after Briand 's luncheon . The Ambassadorial car was standing in a corner , and Lindbergh , more used to fixing and finding his own car or plane than having it brought to him , stepped gaily out across the court toward it . But th , protocol demands that for heroes and for Ambassadors their automobiles must advance right to the doorway . Lindbergh saw at once his mistake and turned back , smiling to the Ambassador . " I am sorry , sir , " he said . " I am not yet used to having a Rolls-Royce come for me . " Solemn Note in Civic Reception . The reception at the Hotel de Ville had a note of solemnity in it because of the city 's mourning over the loss of Captains Nungesser and Coli . Impressiveness was not lacking , and there was a subdued note which made the event more memorable than it would ordinarily have been . The 35,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the City Hall and the streets adjoining kept up a constant cry for Lindbergh through the ceremony , and as soon as the young man could rise from his golden chair he and Ambassador Herrick hurried to a window . Lindbergh quickly jumped to the ledge and waved an American flag . Some fear was felt for his safety , since his support was uncertain and he had little to hold on to , but when the 72-year-old Ambassador insisted upon doing the same thing a cry of anguish went up from the municipal councilors , but not in time to prevent the Ambassador perilously balancing himself on the window sill and waving a French flag . A half dozen members affectionately grabbed him and insisted on his taking a safer position on the floor . Lindbergh 's acknowledgment of the city 's welcome was brief but full of punch . " I am not going to try to thank you for all the wonderful receptions you have given me , because I am too full of emotion to attempt it , " he said . " However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave with you ; that is , that I believe my flight is the forerunner of regular commercial air service uniting my country with yours in a manner In which they have never been united before , as I believe it was the idea which M. Bleriot had in mind in 1909 when he flew the 1Channel that his flight would mark the beginning of commercial aviation . " If those great heroes , Nungesser and Coli , had landed in New York instead of me landing in Paris , I believe they would have expressed a thought very similar to mine . " Herrick Deeply Moved . Ambassador Herrick was so overcome with emotion during his speech that he was almost unable to proceed . The Ambassador believes that this simple youth and his astounding exploit have done more to promote friendly relations between France and America than all the diplomatic efforts of recent years , and he brought this out in his speech . " I am not a religious man , " he said , " but I believe that there is a certain evidence of life which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . I would not be surprised if this flight does mark the beginning of a return of that sympathy and affection which lasted 150 years between France and America . He brought you the spirit of America in a manner in which it could never be brought in a diplomatic sack . " Lindbergh dined quietly tonight and retired early . He is still hesitating about his European tour , although it is definite now that he will leave for Brussels on Saturday and for London on Sunday afternoon . Sweden wants him , Norway , Denmark , Germany , Italy , Spain . In fact nearly every country in - Europe would be glad if he paid it a visit . Lindbergh would like to go to all of these places . As he said , himself , tonight in conversation with THE NEW YORK Tams correspondent , it is his first trip to Europe and he would like to take a good look around . However , there are many persons who are advising him not to prolong his European stay beyond London , and this advice may prevail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of next week . Lindbergh has now received his I official invitation from President , Coolidge to return on a destroyer , and he is keen for it . When it was suggested that traveling on a destroyer was rather rough going , he said : " The rougher , the- better  --  that is just the kind of weather I sleep best
