txt PUBLIC LIBRARY USES . No More Permits to Be Issued for " Drives . " To the Editor of The New York Times : In your issue of May 5 I notice certain comments on the activities in and around the Public Library . You state that " the library officials know of the harm thus done , and regret it , but they are powerless , because their authority does not extend beyond the library walls and steps . " The Park Department , recognizing this situation , has always refused to issue permits for activities of any kind at or near the library without the approval of the library officials . All permits contain the provision that they are issued subject to the consent of the library authorities . You also dwell on the difficulty of saying " no " to people with political influence . This is possibly and probably true . It is , however , quite irrelevant . The influence brought to bear on the department to grant permission for activities near the library has never been of a political nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are common to all men of good-will . At the conclusion of the present Salvation Army drive , eveh.if the approval of the library officials is received , no further permits will be granted . FRANCIS D. GALLATIN . Commissioner of Parks , Borough of Manhattan . New York , May 5 , 1921.
