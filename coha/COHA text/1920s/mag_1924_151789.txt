After mulling over the Tax Reduction Bill for several weeks , the Senate passed it . As in the House , the question was not whether a tax bill should pass , but what its provisions should be . The differences in the bill between the House and Senate versions are accounted for by the different conditions at the time of passage . <P> In the House , the bill was passed after the regular Republicans had compromised with their own left wing . In order to do this it was necessary to raise surtaxes to a maximum of 37% , but the bill as it passed was essentially a Republican bill . <P> In the Senate , the bill was passed by a combination of Democrats and left wing Republicans . Therefore , it was essentially a Democratic bill with an insurgent Republican bias . <P> The final vote in the Senate was 69 to 15 , a few of the regular Republicans voting adversely . Either the House must agree to the Senate provisions , or a compromise be evolved in joint conference . <P> Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) A 25% reduction in taxes payable this year ( both Houses ) . <P> 2 ) Normal taxes , 2% from $1,000 to $4,000 ( both Houses ) ; 4% from $4,000 to $8,000 ( Senate ) or 5% ( House ) ; 6% above $8,000 ( both Houses ) . <P> 3 ) Surtaxes , beginning with 1% on $10,000 and advancing to 40% at $500,000 ( Senate ) , or beginning with 1 on $10,000 and advancing to 37% at $200,000 ( House ) . On the settlement of this difference , slight though it is , will largely depend the question of whether the bill will bear a Democratic or Republican label . <P> 4 ) For earned income , a reduction of 25% in the tax ( both Houses ) with earned income limited to $10,000 ( Senate ) or $20,000 ( House ) . <P> 5 ) Personal exemptions , for single persons $1,000 ( both Houses ) ; for married persons $2,500 ( Senate ) , or $2,500 if net income is less than $5,000 and $2,000 if net income is more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate taxes , beginning at 1% on amounts ( received by each beneficiary ) not in excess of $25,000 and advancing to ft maximum of 36% at $5,000,000 ( Senate ) , or beginning with 1% ( on entire estates ) in excess of $50,000 and advancing to 40% on $10,000,000 and more ( House ) . <P> 7 ) Gift taxes , each House enacted a gift tax identical with its estate or inheritance tax proposal . <P> 8 ) Corporation taxes , 9% on corporate earnings and % on undistributed profits above 10% increasing to a maximum of 40% on undistributed profits over 60% ( Senate ) , or flat tax of 12% on corporate earnings ( House ) . <P> 9 ) Excise taxes abolished ( both Houses ) : <P> Telegraph and telephone . <P> Candy . <P> Knives , dirks , daggers . <P> Liveries . <P> Hunting and riding garments . <P> Yacht and motorboat sales . <P> Carpets , rugs . <P> Floor tax on theatres , circuses . <P> Admissions under 50 . <P> Drafts and promissory notes . <P> As riders on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax returns and appeals and for a reduction of the postal zone rates for newspapers to the 1919 level . <P> Senator Smoot estimated that the bill , as passed by the Senate , would produce a deficit of $162,150,000 not allowing for the enactment of the bonus or other extra drains on the Treasury . Nevertheless he voted for the bill finally , in hope that it would be improved in joint conference .
