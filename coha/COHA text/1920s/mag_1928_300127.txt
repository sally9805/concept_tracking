Above San Diego last week two planes collided . Both pilots hastily climbed from their cockpits , felt for their parachutes , jumped . Lieut . W. L. Cornelius was too hasty . His parachute caught on the instrument board and he was dragged to his death with the two machines which crashed , locked together . So died the second of the army 's famous " Three Musketeers " ( TIME , Sept. 24 ) . At Mines Field Col. Charles A. Lindbergh was for a time the leader of this group of which Lieut . Irving A. Woodring is now the sole survivor . <P> Thirty-eight thousand feet above Dayton , Ohio , Capt . A. W. Stevens and Lieut . J. H. Doolittle were taking photographs . When their instruments indicated that they were flying toward the city at the rate of a mile a minute , they were in reality being carried away by a head wind of 115 miles an hour . Soon the thermometer registered 57 below zero and instruments ceased to work at all . Finally the oxygen line to Capt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . When Lieut . Doolittle struck him a stinging blow in the face he recovered just long enough to see his assailant fall forward exhausted by the exertion this effort had cost him at such an altitude . Out of control , the plane dived thousands of feet into the oxygen-laden air below , where both made a timely recovery , landed the plane , delivered the photographs . <P> <P> Bert R. J. Hassell and Parker D. Cramer , Rockford , Ill. , to Sweden flyers , long lost in Greenland , last week arrived by boat in Denmark , enthusiastic about Greenland as a way station for trans-Atlantic flyers , full of plans for another attempt .
