The post-War problem of the American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. in obtaining funds for bettering its equipment and service has been a huge one . Fortunately , the Company has enjoyed far-sighted management and excellent credit . As a result , the capitalization of the Company has been steadily increased through sales of its securities to the public . After a campaign designed to sell stock to telephone subscribers , such wide distribution of A. T. &; T. shares has been obtained that the company 's stockholders now number 300,000 . This is the largest shareholders ' list in the world ; if all the company 's share-partners lived in one city , the latter would rank 20th in population in the U. S. <P> But " Tel . &; Tel. " has not been satisfied by becoming the only billion-dollar public utility concern in the country . Last week , it successfully floated $125,000,000 35-year bonds to finance further additions and betterments to the associated Bell Telephone companies . <P> The issue was notable in two respects . It was the largest bond issue ever floated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the $150,000,000 Japanese Government loan of less than a year ago . Moreover , the terms of the loan were second only to those accorded to our Federal Government and our stronger states . The coupon of the Telephone issue is 5% , and the bonds were sold to the public at 95 to yield about 5.30 . This interest charge is about one-third less than that recently obtainable by the Governments of Japan , Germany , France and Belgium , on their recent large loans in our financial markets .
