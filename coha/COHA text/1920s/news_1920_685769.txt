txt Governor Cox continued his fighting campaign in California today . He talked to a meeting of women at noon , and was applauded when he asked them to stand by him in battling for the League of Nations and progressive government . No was received with enthusiasm at a meeting of the Commercial Club this afternoon , and faced a great audience in the Oakland Auditorium tonight . In hIs addresses during the day and tonight Governor Cox took up the subject of profiteering . Governor Cox received a warm welcome when he talked about the League of Nations to more than a thousand Women at the St. Francis Hotel today . A group of about sixty women , dressed In mourning , led the cheering as he advocated the entry of the United States into the League . All of them had lost sons in the war . One of the most enthusiastic was a woman of at least seventy years . " Whenever sober-thinking people de  --  slop resentment against government , you will always find that the case has been one of governmental impotency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Governor Cox at Oakland tonight . " When conditions are obviously wrong Quid unjust , the great mass of our people look upon government for relief , for the reason that individual action or community co-operation are not effective . " In my travels through the Western country I studied carefully the symptoms of so-called radical movements . Leaders of them , in some instances , are radicals in the truest sense , but the rank and file I have found to be a sincere , well-intentioned people who complain , and complain bitterly , of abuses which government could have corrected but did not because it was in reactionary hands . Ones Fits Record In Coal Shortage . " I cite a personal experience where it was necessary to apply the force of government in the face of human suffering without any hair-splitting coheiderations as to method . In the bitter Winter of the war miles and miles of cars filled with coal were crossing our State , consigned by the Fuel Administrator to the Lakes . The Lakes were trosen . People could look out of their homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tons of fuel billed to ports from which it could not be Waived . Self-preservation is the first law of nature , and it would have been Invoked , with accruing chaos and some disorder , if government had not Intervened . 1 seized the coal and turned it over to the people , after adopting a systematic method of compensation to the owners . " This was a demonstration of the adaptability of Government to stressful conditions . There are times when this sort of thing must be done . It will be useful when crises arise in connection with food . The recent reign of profiteers who owned the supply of sugar is an impressive instance . There should be authority lodged and facilities provided to prevent recurrences . " I am in favor , under circumstances ouch as this , of the Government , through Congress , supplying a rotary fund to be placed in the hands of the President of the United States for the purchase of as much of the sugar crop as is necessary to prevent profiteering . If elected in November I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergencies in food supplies . " If government is to hold public confidence it must serve the public neeas. it must be responsive to the conditions of humanity . In emergencies some agency of the Government must be given the kind of authority that will admit of prompt action . It must act as quickly OS the policeman when burglary is attempted . This will not develop into a common practice . It will be a homely illustration of the effect of the musket behind the door . " The extent to which profiteering pre'Wailed during the war , and especially since the signing of the armistice , has been outrageous . The excess of corporate profits alone over the average Ito : the pro-war ' priod , conservatively estimated at the almost incredible figure of $5,000,000,000 a year , is appalling . Expressed in terms every man can understand , this is an average increased cost of $250 per family annually , or approximately $1,500 per family since the outbreak of hostilities . " The amount stolen from the householders of America in that time by the profiteers would pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war itself . For evidence of this you need only look In the pages of the Congressional Record , view tee reports of the Federal Trade Commission , examine the archives of the Department of Justice , read our financial journals and taste even the reports of the corporations themselves . Says Congress Protected Profiteer .. " For five long years we have borne the burdens of an increasing profiteering , sordid , sentient , ugly and hateful in all its aspects . An effort was made immediately at the close of the war , as soon as facts were at hand , to have Congress reduce excessive prices and profits . President Wilson appealed directly to Congress after the signing of the armistice . Again in December , 1919 , In a special message to Congecss , he repeated his request that something be done at once to remedy the deplorable condition . Definite remedial measures - were suggested and submitted and as definitely rejected by a Republican Congress in a dastardly attempt to keep the people in distress that reactionary influences might win a Presidential election in 1920 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleefully while the great mass of our people was in distress . With full knowledge of the facts , they looked calmly upon the most shameless profiteering which indefensible greed could impose upon its helpless victims . They turned away unresponsively from the warnings of the more far-seeing of their own party colleagues , such as Senators Capper and Kenyon , who pointed out , ae the Congressional Record will show , that Republican inaction was developing a feeling of hate among certain groups in the country and that it was in reality the primary cause of extreme radicalism and revolutionary agitation which have stood in the way of our industrial reconstruction . " And now comes forward the candidate of the Senatorial oligarchy with the mere statement of the people that excessive prices and profiteering are criminal and should be stopped . He presents no suggestions for the prevention of crime or the apprehension of the criminals . What in reality he does is to prepare the way fox a new era of higher prices and profiteering by announcing his intention of changing our tariff rates to those of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for leadership in the Sanate. away from the reactionary crowd , his voice was silent , and yet there had been proposed these practical , concrete and definite measures to reduce the coat of living and eliminate the profiteer : " First , a law limiting the period during which goods may be kept in cold storage ; second , a law requiring that the prices at which goods were placed . n storage must he maeked upon them : third , a law ** that all destined for interstate commerce shall qwq Interests Johnson Followers . It is asserted here that the followers of Senator Hiram Johnson , whom California voters have held up as the exponent of progressive government , have little use for Smator Harding . Havaigr now heard Governor Cox , some say that he is more representative of Theodore Roosevelt and Sentaor Johnson than any candidate they have heard Or years . In Sacramento , San Francisco and Oakland Governor Cox has made a favorable impression , as he did in the Northwest . According to some Johnson leaders , thousands of voters of this State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here are waiting to hear what Senator Johnson may have to say in his campaign speeches for Senator Harding . In the event that Senator Johnson lauds Harding only because of his stand for the destruction of the League of Nations there are some here who feel that Johnson may do Senator Harding more harm that good . The antipathy to the League of Nations is said to be not nearly as strong here as is the demand for progress in government . Many are asking how Johnson can throw his support to Senator Harding where the issue of progressive government is concerned , and that he must make good on this score or lose a lot of his strength . It is said that he probably will retain control of the State situation so far as he is personally concerned , but that he may have another situation on his hands like the one he faced in 1910 when , because of personal popularity . he received a great majority as the nominee for Senator , while Hughes lost the State on the Presidential issue . Refers to Japanese Problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall last night while discussing the Japanese question , that " God Almighty provided that the fathers of America should be white men , " was much discussed here today . Here is what Governor Cox said : " Some one said , ' America first . ' Yes and every part of America . I know whet your thought is with reference to foreign ownership of land . God Almighty intended this hemisphere , this continent , which is now called America , to ? be the experimental field for the sons of men throughout all time , and when Christopner Columbus discovered it the Almighty pulled back the curtain , and then and there ? was staged the greatest drama in all the bisto-y of the world . " And here , under the inspiration of the hour , the fertile fields , the forests , the mineral resources were made a part of the reclamation of a great continent . And then our fathers instituted a democracy form of Government , not only for the benefit , the happiness , the improvement of our children and our children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples of the earth as well . And God Almighty provided that the fathers of America should be white men . They blinded the ideals upon wi  --  e ! : a republic has lived , and those ideals Rill be maintained , and those from other shores who are not disposed to subscribe to that doctrine have the privilege of going back whence they came . " Would Like Hoover In Cabinet . SAN FRANCISCO , Sept. 18 ( Arse dated Press ) . ? Governor Cox , in an ad dress today before a luncheon of bus ! ness men , referred to Herbert Hooves as the type of trained mind he would like to have in his Cabinet if elected . " Mr. Hoover 's effective service in the war was largely due to his thorotuth training as an engineer , " he said , " and if I can induce him , one of the best Engineers in the country will sit In my Cabinet . " The Governor also favored in this speech the abolition of the excess profits tax , which he said , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the substitution for it of a lax of 1 er 1% per cent , on the volume of business a firm . ?
