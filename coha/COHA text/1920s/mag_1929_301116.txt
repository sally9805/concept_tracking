On the 27th birthday of Prince George , last week , his comptroller , Major Ulick Alexander , sought to calm public uneasiness at the fact that for some weeks the precise whereabouts of H. R. H. have not been generally known . After asserting that Prince George had been " staying at Sunningdale and devoting a large part of his time to golf , " Major Alexander said : " It must always be borne in mind that his digestion is weak and . what perhaps is not generally known , that he suffers from insomnia . " <P> The Major added that his charge is not expected to resume his post at the Foreign Office for " several months . " Rumors are current in London that H. R. H. combats insomnia with white powders , one school of rumor holding that they are ordinary sleeping powders .
