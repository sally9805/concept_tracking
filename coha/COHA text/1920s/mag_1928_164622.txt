Something about a Barbe Bleu fires the emotions of Frenchmen . Men marry women and kill them for their wealth in every land ; but in France a Barbe Bleu is news . Last week was bluebeard week at Marseilles , the chief and most casually immoral port city of France , and a famed stockade for transient White Slavers . <P> In the basement of a villa at Marseilles were found some weeks ago , the bodies of two women who appeared to have been bluebearded . The tenant , M. Camille Gaillard , was said to have been seen escaping with the body of a third woman slung over his shoulder in a sack . <P> Then from Algiers came sailing toward Marseilles , last week , another Barbe Blue , with 18 women to his discredit . He was 60 , and named Jerome Drat . Through some occult divination the Marseilles poor unequalled for viciousness in all France , decided that the two Barbe Bleus were the same man under different aliases , and prepared to give him a brick-and-bludgeon reception . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Algeria 's Barbe Bleu at the island in the harbor of Marseilles on which stands the Chateau d'If , made famed by Duma 's Monte Cristo . <P> There 60-year-old Bluebeard Drat said to his police guards , " Kill me right away , do n't bother me with questions about women .
