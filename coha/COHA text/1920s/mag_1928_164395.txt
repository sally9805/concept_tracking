President Coolidge continued his " fight " to keep the Flood Control bill from passing the House in the form it was given by the Senate ( TIME , April 9 ) . When President Coolidge " fights " a bill he usually does it by inviting his Congressional lieutenants to the White House and hearing what they can tell him about the opposition , about the possibilities for compromise . He himself says little , letting the White House atmosphere and a few wry questions stimulate the mental activity of the lieutenants . Then , as the lieutenants plan and discuss , President Coolidge draws negative lines here and there . After last week 's Flood Control conference , Speaker Longworth , Floorleader Tilson and Representatives Snell ( New York ) , Madden ( Illinois ) and Kopp ( Iowa ) emerged from the White House talking about compromises which President Coolidge would be able to approve . The effect of the compromises would be , it was said , to keep the $325,000,000 expenditure " estimated " in the Senate bill actually down to some $325,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , flood-work contracts would be controlled by the President and the Secretary of War ; also , the States benefited would actually contribute some $10,000,000 in rights-of-way , to demonstrate the principle of local contribution . <P> Harry A. Mackay , mayor of Philadelphia , creature of the beery Republican machine of U. S. Senator-suspect Vare , took some Congressmen for a tour of the Philadelphia Navy Yard last week . On the way he made a speech , saying : " In Washington they have all the dry members of Congress who make the laws and have legislative authority over the District of Columbia . They could mobilize very easily the greatest force of dry agents in the country . They have the highest administrative authority-the President of the United States-and yet Philadelphia is making a far greater effort than Washington to enforce prohibition . <P> " Why do n't the President and Congress set the rest of the country a real example in enforcement of the dry law , if prohibition is enforceable ? " <P> Washington police , forewarned by the U. S. State Department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placard-bearers who appeared one day outside the White House in the name of the All-American Anti-Imperialist League . " Wall Street and not Sandino is the real bandit , " said one placard . " We do not appeal to the White House but to the masses against the White House , " said another . In the White House , unaware that his Nicaraguan policy was being so openly criticized , President Coolidge shook hands with other , flattered , peaceful tourists . <P> Mrs. Coolidge returned to Washington from Northampton , Mass . Her sick mother was better . . . . Governor and Mrs. Trumbull of Connecticut and Florence Trumbull , their daughter , were invited to the White House . Mrs. Trumbull was attending a D. A. R. convention . . . . Persons who think President Coolidge should fly with Col. Lindbergh ( see LETTERS ) commented upon the matter-of-factness with which Governor Trumbull announced that he would fly to Washington from Hartford . He used a new Wasp-motored Ox-12 plane , piloted by an aide .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
