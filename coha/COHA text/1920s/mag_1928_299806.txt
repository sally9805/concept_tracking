A good average Englishman drinks , besides his normal consumption of beer , ale , wine , whiskey and gin , about nine pounds of tea per annum . A good average American drinks less than one pound of tea per annum . So found Major Norman McLeod , British teaman , who lately surveyed the U. S. tea market . So learned the executive committee of the Tea Association of America , re-reading the McLeod survey at a meeting last week . <P> Teamen think tea can replace alcoholics in the U. S. They cherish Prohibition . Said the McLeod survey : <P> " Can any one say we English are ... a degenerate race suffering from disturbed nerve centres ? We have come to realize that tea-drinking is definitely refreshing , exhilarating and harmless . . . . Alcohol is the most expensive drink in America today and tea the cheapest . . ' . . The stimulating effects . . . will go a long way toward staying the taste for alcohol . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
