" . . . Georgia is proud of Governor Osborn , not merely because he is a citizen but because he is such a loyal and devoted one . His description of a sunset in south Georgia is one of the most beautiful pieces of word-painting that ever flowed from the pen of any writer . His new book-the last of a long series of serious discussions - will find a hearty welcome in this state and throughout the south . " <P> So rhapsodized the aged but active Atlanta Constitution last week , not in a book review but right spang on the editorial page . The " spot " news was that the Waverly Press , Inc . ( Baltimore ) had published a re-edition of The Earth Upsets by Chase Salmon Osborn , LL.D. -a geology book for laymen. - <P> Chase Salmon Osborn used to be not Georgia 's but Michigan 's Governor , in 1911 and 1912 . He rose to that office from the comparatively humble positions of postmaster at Sault Ste. Marie , Mich. ( 1889-93 ) , then Michigan game &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the University of Michigan . What made Michiganders admire him much was his great feat as a mining engineer-the discovery of the Moose Mountain iron range in Canada . Brawny , brainy , he made a good public servant-Georgia 's claim to Chase Salmon Osborn is that he usually winters near Albany , Ga. , where his estate is known as " ' Possum Poke on ' Possum Lane . " Had any Michigan newspaper desired to reclaim " one of the most prolific writers in this country " as a Michigander , it would only have had to point to Dr. Osborn 's permanent home at Sault Ste. Marie . But then , had argument arisen , still a third state could have stepped in and carried off the prize . Michigan 's Governor , Georgia 's citizen , who started out in the world as a cub reporter , was born , like so many other famed writers , in the once-great but latterly self-belittled state of Indiana . Dr. Osborn evinced his faith in Indiana when , in 1926 , he asked President Coolidge to let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Governor , Warren T. McCray ( see CORRUPTION ) , who had been jailed for mail fraud . Said generous Dr. Osborn : " I have nothing to do , I have no dependents and I am used to more hardships than a prison entails . " <P> <P> * First published in 1924 . Dr. Chase Salmon Osborn is not to be confused with Dr. Henry Fairfield Osborn of the American Museum of Natural History .
