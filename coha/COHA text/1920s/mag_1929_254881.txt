If persons holding funerals could turn on their radios and receive appropriate mortuary music , would it not enhance services for the dead ? A fixed hour might be set for the nationwide broadcasting of funeral music and nationwide funerals might be timed accordingly . A resolution urging such procedure was introduced at a meeting of the New Jersey State Funeral Directors ' Association , held last week in Camden , by John S. Martin , mortician , delegate from Elizabeth , N. J.
