ILL.mi , vocARTT is worth mentioning that a warm let- ter has come from a. reader who is indignant over the reported practice of the Hadley Rescue Hall of turning vagrants into the Lai street at five a.m .

We are inclined to agree with his opinion that ill-mannered and ungracious charity has an ugly sound .

The question on every cultured lip is , " Have you seen it ? " Even horse-lovers are talking art . If patronage be any standard whereby painters may be judged , Sargent is already a classic with full grown wings and budding halo . Never has any exhibit attracted so many people who could say they knew the subject of this or that portrait , or at least some of the subject 's relations . The elevators have been overloaded with kindly old ladies who dared not face the stairs  --  or the fact that big hats with flowers on them went out some time ago . Daughters and granddaughters were with them , to learn how successful an American painter can he if he conscientiously lives in England . During the first part of the week , some indignation was aroused by the fact that they printed only two thousand copies of the catalogue . As a result , the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunder , due , as nearly as we can find out , to someone 's having thought that the larger Sargent exhibition just closed in Boston  --  and from which fully half of the pictures now on view came  --  would take the edge off . Even if the younger school of painters is not altogether in sympathy with Sargent , the show is an event . We heard little but praise the day we were there . Oddly enough , although there were many pictures that have seldom been shown in New York , the favorite seemed to be the portrait of " Madame X " , alias Mme. Gautreau , which has been sitting for years in the Metropolitan . Perhaps this is because Mine . Gautreau , although weak on relations in this country , is very beautiful .

Already the usual number of requests for special permission to wear costumes out of the period have been received . The most amusing comes from The Masters ' of Fox Hounds Association . Last year the Masters held their annual meeting in New York the day of the Beaux Arts Ball ? by a coincidence . They went to the ball and came away early in the morning full of delight . So they decided to hold their meeting at the same time this year . And now it turns out that , unless they get a special dispensation , they can not wear their pink coats .

With a great effort , thinking back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was opened , we stand sponsor for the fact that no twenty story building existed on the Avenue between Forty-second and Fifty-ninth Streets before that monumental structure was erected . And since then none other has risen in that district above the twentieth story to compete with it . Two years from today , however , according to Alfred Ashforth , there will be , in all probability , eight ! Mystic ! Wonderful ! Three of the new ones are already under way . The apartment house on the Plaza will be twenty-nine stories , the Delmonico Building at Forty-fourth Street will he thirty-three , the French Building at Forty-fifth Street will be thirty-one . And all of them will look down on the Heckscher golden cock . Four others are definitely projected ; a huge hotel at Fifty-eighth Street , an office building at Fifty-second Street , another one at Fifty-sixth Street , and another where the Temple Emanu-El now stands . Schulte in the meanwhile has bought a block at Fifty-seventh Street and is going to do something colossal with it , no one knows what . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Censorship MHE reaction of the movie kings A to Governor Smith 's plan to scrap the board of movie censorship of New York State is said to be restrained on the surface only . The supposition is that they are secretly jubilant , and that the only reason they do n't rejoice out loud is because rejoicing in America has come to be considered by the neighbors a sign positive that something naughty is contemplated . As a matter of fact , they have other and good reasons for keeping their emotions under control . Boards of censorship , contrary to general opinion , are composed of human beings and are liable to change color with the political situation . Since Governor Smith has long been avowedly against the censorship , it now comes about that the revered hoard of Republican censors set up by Mr. Miller , the austere , has been supplanted by a Democratic board , which has exercised its power of deletion not at all , and now concludes that the best thing it can do is abolish itself . The movie magnates , in short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor , and they realize that the only thing he would accomplish for the immediate future , by abolishing the institution , would be to get rid of the jiggely announcement that meets our gaze at the beginning of every film . They wonder which is better , no censorship beard at all , or the present delightful situation in which the censors do n't censor anything . Abolition of the board , our moving picture friend tells us , would be a big step forward in Mr. Will Hays 's ambitious national program to kill off all the state boards ; but in this instance there is the chance that when Dr. Straton , who is generally conceded to be a not very clear thinker , finds out that there are no censors at all , he will hit the canopy of his pulpit and insist , on principle , that one be instituted . The result might revive the whole mess . ? MR . DWIGHT PERRIN , City Editor of the Herald Tribune , recently had occasion to call up Otto Kahn . He was informed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ; it 's an important message , " Perrin insisted . " Oh , only the butler is allowed to wake Mr. Kahn . " " Let me talk to the butler then .

" Forty Million MR . MUNSEY 'S famous forty millions donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art brings with it , of course , almost as many questions as to what that institution proposes to do with such a sum . But the Museum , according to rumors that have come to us , already has a plan . Very properly they will give out no details of it , even to friends , but the report exists . It is that the Metropolitan Museum needs money badly , not for pictures , but to buy butter and eggs with . The institution , it seems , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the generous patrons and directors who have to meet the annual deficit . They have had bequests aplenty from time to time , but all of them have been bequests to buy pictures or sculpture . Now comes Mr. Munsey 's millions with no string to them ; and there breaks out on the faces of directors a broad , broad smile . And these broad smiles have sent the rumor about town that much of the income from the forty million will go for salaries and such mundane things as heat , water , varnish , cockroach powder , and whatever else is needed in buildings , and that it will not go to buy more art . Legs GRANTRANTED that no one ever looks ED at New York 's statuary for the reason that it is an unnoticeable lot , yet from time to time one hears of someone wondering why the legs of the Seward statue in Madison Square are so long . Everett Martin , of Cooper Union , declared in one of his recent lectures that he knows . Soon after the death of Lincoln , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentlemen then in our City Hall derided New York ought to have one . Before the work was completed , however , a new Mayor was elected who did n't approve of Lincoln statues . He liked Seward , Lincoln 's Secretary of State . It was a blow to the sculptor , who , said in despair , " Will you take a statue of Mr. Seward ? " The City Hall was delighted and instructed him to go ahead , whereupon the sculptor returned happily to his studio , decapitated Mr. Lincoln , and substituted the head of his Secretary of State . So much for Mr. Seward 's legs . The next thing is to put the head of General Pershing on Lafayette , and that of Admiral Sims on Farragut . Tone MR . DONAHUE and Mr. Hammond 's three-pedaled piano were again to the fore last Thursday ; this time in the woefully antiquated ballroom and picture gallery of Mrs. Astor .

The question is , would n't the piano sound better if he kept the slats open all the time . Most opinions are that it would  --  if he took the slats off altogether . On the other hand there appears to have been nothing mechanical about Miss Lewis 's contributions to the recital . The most flattering opinion is that she was wonderful ; the least flattering is that she sang very nearly perfectly in very nearly perfect En id WI and French . ?

' " Motors ANY attraction which can pack its I house to capacity in the cold grey light of a Monday morning has the seeds of success . The Twenty-sixth annual automobile show which has been running at Grand Central Palace since Saturday has amply proved the advertising salesman 's declaration that the number of motor enthusiasts are legion . During the past six days everybody who has ever drunk a bottle of pop on the Mohawk trail has paid his seventy-five cents and made the rounds . The yearly show is the supreme effort and more or less the raison d'itre of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce . It was originally designed chiefly for dealers and dealer-education . But of late years it has been completely swamped by people who are paying installments on second hand cars and who wish to see just how badly they got stung . For completeness and organization this year 's show has left little to be desired . There are fifty-six makes represented , and several hundred accessories .

Perhaps it would be lese majesty to say that the cars all looked as if they had come out of the same factory , but certainly the trend of the industry is towards standardization and a sensible car at a sensible price . The models were practically all closed ; practically all of them had cigar lighters and wind shield cleaners . It is a very business-like show display . And our impression was that the American car is going to go another year without trying to compete , so far as exterior design is concerned , with the for eign makes which lent splendor to the Salon some months ago , Returned OLONEL ALEXANDER P.

Colonel Moore used to own a newspaper in Pittsburgh .

Those who delight in telling of the gaucheries of our representatives abroad have as much to recount about Colonel Moore as any of the rest but , nevertheless , he seems to have left a favorable impression upon the Spanish Court . He made of the Queen an undying friend by telling her , it is said , that she looked like Lillian Russell , and , he told the King he had rather not be bothered calling him " Your Majesty  --  I 'll call you Chief .

Tables for six , including supper , one hundred dollars ; individual tickets , ten dollars ; everybody dressed in red and gold ; fun to be had by debutantes et al ; money to go to the Junior League Shelter for Children , Fifteen thousand dollars clear is hoped for , which shows that the Jun-ior League is a going concern , well able to take care of its new club house in Sixty-first Street . As a matter of fact , the dance supplants the usual vaudeville and leg-to-the-knee-only show of other years , against which those who feel they can see twenty better shows on Broadway for less money have often said hard things .

There is a training course to be gone through , during which a real propensity to do some work for the League has to be evinced . As a social organization , it may be nonsense , but as an organization to get a certain percentage of efficiency out of the young amateur worker , it is not nonsense at all .

Folk Songs ANUMBER of enthusiastic Americans with , perhaps , a greater than average capacity to consume alcohol with one foot on a brass rail have been viewing with alarm the effect of prohibition on the barroom ballad , under which head is included the army ballad . And now two gentlemen of Rochester say that something must be done about it . They are making a collection of the dits to he published privately for the benefit of posterity . On their behalf , Mr. Alan N. Steyne ( he may be addressed in care of Mr. William B. Powell , 347 Fifth Avenue ) is now seeking material to go into the book : little known verses of " Hinky Dinky Parley Vous " , " Larry Turn the Crank " , " Down the Lehigh Valley " , and anything else the ravages of time have overlooked .

And besides , everybody knows ( excepting reformers who believe the propaganda of bootleggers who approve the status quo ) that there is more drinking today than ever before . Polite Transportation . THE suggestion of a young man , who is working his way up in the Bus Company , that the solution of the traffic problem is the abolition of the private car , is naivete itself if you disagree with him . But from what we hear , engineers and other experts are inclined to think there is something in it . Since we have been talking traffic , we have met an amazing number of people who have statistics on the subject . A host of figures have been arrived at showing relative wheel bases of buses and private cars , . all of which simmers down to show that one bus can carry as many people as forty private cars . This is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of the bus in New York ? No . Well , then , although there are only twenty-five more buses on Fifth Avenue today than there were a year ago , three new routes were opened last year ' way up town . Three more are contemplated this year . One is to run down Park Avenue from Ninety-sixth Street to City Hall via Madison Avenue , Broadway , University Place and Lafayette Street . Others are to go crosstown in Forty-ninth and Fiftieth Streets . When tied down , the young bus man further deposed and said that the brown buses are not New York Buses at all , but Chicago ones , run over to New York on account of there not being enough green ones here to go round . He also settled the point about aces ? those drivers who flaunt flags . There are two of them , and they are the winners of the two prizes given weekly to the drivers using the least amount of gasoline during the preceding seven days . We also learned that the reason the buses going to Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one on the other is to enable them to get under a certain very low elevated which is on that route . They are a foot lower than most buses ; and in order to make them so , the seats had to be arranged in a peculiar fashion . Intricate engineering , and it would take space to explain . SUBURBAN buses , by the way , seem to be coming into their own . They are elegant in the extreme , and vie with each other in accoutrements . We see them in Fifth Avenue , scooting off into side streets towards the ferries , over which they have right of way . You can go anywhere in them , even to Philadelphia and Boston . They are cheaper than the trains , but not so rapid . ?
