Dean Pound accepted , then lent ear to Harvard entreaties and changed his mind ( TIME , Feb. 2 , 9 ) . <P> More pondering at Wisconsin . Advices from Madison , seat of the University , told , last week , that at a special meeting Regent Michael Olbrich arose to nominate " one of America 's great men , " a college president 's onetime secretary , a noted merchant 's onetime associate , now a distinguished editor , thinker , liberal reformer in Church and State . Regent Olbrich nominated Editor Glenn Frank of The Century Magazine , salting his eulogy with the pertinent fact that Editor Frank , only 38 years old , should have much life left in him to give to the University of Wisconsin at $12,000 a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wis. , telephone operator to connect her with Editor Frank in Manhattan without further delay . A deputation of the Regents was appointed to pack suitcases , entrain and wait on Editor Frank in person . <P> Awaiting these advances , of which the press advised him , Editor Frank must have reflected on his position .

They are , or should be , an indivisible unity . . . . The professor , the parson and the politician are at work on the same job . . . the achievement of ' the good life ' for the citizen and for the Nation .
