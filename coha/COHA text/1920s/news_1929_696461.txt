txt The entire world is becoming automobile minded . In three years , according to statistics gathered by the department of commerce , the number of persons to each automobile has dropped on the globewide basis from seventy-one to sixty-one. seventy-one to a car was the figure on Jan. 1 , 1926 . A year later it was sixty-one to one . On Jan. 1 , 1928 , the estimate was sixty-four to one . At the beginning of the present year the department accepted 32,028,584 as the number of automobiles running and 1,949.000.000 as the world 's population , or sixteen cars to 1,000 people . The United States , as Is well known , leads in the use and manufacture of motors , with one for each 4.87 persons . It is rather striking that the English speaking nations and colonies have taken more enthusiastically to this form of transport than any others . The Hawaiian islands are close behind continental America with a car to every six inhabitants . Canada has one for nine residents , as has New Zealand .

There is still a great deal to be done before it can be said a ride is always available outside the United States . Eliminating the cars in this country , the population per motor in the other countries is 247 . The department of commerce holds that nearly all these people would be willing and anxious to ride , but that their economic condition is too low to permit even a hopo that they can get their wishes before many years . It is probable , however . that the invasion of Europe by American corpo rations , planting their factories be hind tariff walls where they exist and hiring the local labor for mass ell ciency methods , will bring a large in. crease in car buying and car riding 1E the more progressive nations . The argument that the people of such countries can not afford automn biles is valid up to a certain point only . It is a moot question whether the buying of motor cars was a. result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them  --  often by persons who did n't have the cash to pay for them  --  was the principal factor in prosperity . Basis of Prosperity . The last named view has much to recommend it . The building of roads , the servicing of automobiles , the hauling of the necessary materials on the railroads for all these activities have formed so large a part of our economic structure in the recent past that it is doubtful if even the economists have given the industry its just due in this country . The hot dog stands on the roadsides and the often unsightly billboards , whatever else may be said against them , have furnished theesands with a livelihood that would have been impossible without travel by automobile on a grand scale . Perhaps the most interesting developments in the next few years will come out of this effort of American capital to meet Europeans on their own grounds with a typically American idea ; that the whole world ought to be on wheels whenever it desires to be .

The increase in the capital stock of the Baldwin Locomotive Works to 2,000,000 , of which 800,000 shares of no par value will be exchanged for the present 200.000 shares of $100 par value on the basis of 4 for 1 , is the sequel to one of the most spectacular stock market battles ever fought and in which the victors hardly knew what to do with the spoils after they were won .

Meanwhile , the floating supply of the shares had been entirely cleaned up as the quotation soared through 250 and ran on up to 285 , the highest point at which the stock had ever sold . Shorts had been repeatedly whipped in the stock and obliged to cover their commitments time after time , some of them taking tremendous losses . With the floating supply very small , and with the Baldwin shares at times lending at a sharp premium , trading in it became smaller and smaller , because of the fact that it had got beyond the reach of the average speculator , and because of the drastic financial punishment which had been meted out to the shorts .
