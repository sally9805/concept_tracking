Cambridge University , last week , conferred upon James Loeb the degree of Doctor of Laws . Gentlemen who receive honorary degrees at Cambridge are formally presented by a public orator who chimes their achievements on the bronze bells of a very dead and very beautiful language . The speaker who so served Doctor Loeb began by quoting Pindar . If he misrepresented the Greek , he said , there was one present who had taken great pains to have all authors truly rendered ( here there was the graceful flourish of a gowned arm ) - Mr. Loeb . The bell-ringing orator spoke with as much justice as courtesy . For Mr. Loeb , onetime member of Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , famed banking house , * is founder of the Loeb Classical Library , which provides texts and translations of " all that is of value and interest in Greek and Latin literature , from the time of Homer to the fall of Constantinople . " <P> Over 159 volumes of this library , at $2.50 a volume , have been issued in the U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the library , when completed , will contain 500 volumes . The editors are Prof. T. E. Page , Prof. W. H. B. Rouse , eminent English classicists , and Dr. Edward Capps of Princeton . The translations are all beautifully done and printed with the page of the original at the left , balanced by the English version at the right . They are not all new translations . Some are themselves classics , as , for example , Apuleius ' Golden Ass in the version which William Adlington made in 1566 . No uniform edition of the classics has ever before been attempted on such a scale . The annual loss , a large one , is borne by Mr. Loeb . He , when he had retired from active business to devote himself to literary and archaeological studies , translated two classic dramas from the French . <P> <P> *Otto H. Kahn , patron of music , is the present senior partner ; Mortimer Schiff , golfer , the junior .                 @ @ @ @
