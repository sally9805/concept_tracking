temporary Americans . He starts off for the court every morning at 11:30 as if on an errand for the gods ? whereas he is to listen to argument from 12 to 2 ; lunch from 2 to 2:30 ; sit again from 2:30 to 4:30 . Judge Cardozo has used , of his sentences , the word " phosphorescence . " Always Holmes gives out light . When he returns from the court to the sober dignity of his old house on I Street ? formerly it was on foot ; now the Chief Justice is likely to drive him a part of the distance ; but who can be sure that , disdaining his elevator , he will not still take his stairs two steps at a time ? ? he will be able , with the young secretary who guards the book-lined antechamber of his library , with the visitor , to search thought and make it glow . The secretary ? a new jewel of the Harvard Law School every year ? wears an exalted air . He must promise not to get engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says the justice with a twinkle , " to die , or resign . " With this young mind the Justice twists the tail of the still recalcitrant cosmos , en ? gages in legal disputation , reads his opinions for criticism as modestly as if he were a novice . Some ? times but rarely there is a point of law to look up . For Holmes carries the law in his head , as an In ? dian carries the legends of his people , or a prophet the words of the Lord . And the justice , in his own fine and ornamental script , answers every personal letter scrupulously , almost within the hour . " My messenger is waiting . " Off it goes . The eye that falls upon the delicate missive in the cheap plethora of the morning mail has found treasure . Every page has some metaphysical touchstone , some liter ? ary epigram or casual heresy . " When I die the Great Panjandrum may say , ' Flolrnes , why have n't you read Thucydides ? ' " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl tells me Shakespeare is long in getting to the point . I think we take our ? selves too seriously . " Mr. Justice Holmes , who has permanently en ? riched our law , our literature , our philosophy ? of whom another distinguished judge has said : " There is Holmes ? and there are all the other judges " ? takes himself far less seriously than any good Ro ? tarian . That blithe nonchalance , that true humble ? ness in the face of acknowledged human vanities seems to his friends a part of his unerrino. taste . But it provokes distrust in those who need the sup ? port of the rolling platitudes of the Fathers . Holmes bears his critics no grudge . His courtesy to his fellows , like his generosity , is basic , and he has an innocent heart . When one sees his gracious fig ? ure outlined against his bookshelves full of classics , with their spaces for the books the Lord will omit mentioning and their gaps for the books of the fu ? ture , one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine fresh color . The voice , with its humorous vain echo of hesitation ? mmm --  -- -that seems to set off the sparks in the eyes , has clarity and fervor . Maliciously it expunges the name of a popular New England poet from the slate of time ; honestly it admits that gentlemen prefer blondes . But . it will never allow our modern American idol , publicity , a niche in this hospitable library . If glory , is here she is hidden , diffused into a clear serenity , a scent of tender memory , a vital intellectual re ? plenishment . Yet do not think of Oliver Wendell Holmes as meagrely recompensed . He has found it well , he says , to have philosophy " the main wind of his life blowing from the side , instead of from behind . " He has had his reward in the inspired performance of a daily task , in the constant siege of the eternal verities . Holmes was an infantry officer , at Ball 's Bluff , but in the field of ideas he belongs to an arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fabulous skirmisher , a cavalier for all his " cold Puritan passion " who carries a pennon as well as a lance , and with it " that little flutter which means ideals .
