The President of Mexico sat facing an assassin who had just murdered the President Elect . <P> Terrible but controlled was the anger of President Plutarco Elias Calles at the death of his dearest friend and closest political associate , President Elect Alvaro Obregon . <P> President glared at Assassin as might lion at weasel . How to make the pale but unflinching weasel squeak ? <P> Christ the King . The precise words of ensuing dialog will perhaps never be established to the satisfaction of all . Accepted version : <P> President Calles-What motive had you to deprive General Obregon of his life ? <P> Assassin-By order of Christ the King , that His laws should have due effect in Mexico . <P> President-What was your real object in killing him ? <P> Assassin-That damnation should not rest upon the people . <P> President-WTho were your accomplices in this crime ? <P> Assassin-I had none . If there had been others their firing would have created confusion . <P> President-How did you expect to get out of this tragedy ? <P> Assassin-I believed that I would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still alive . That proves that all is the work of the Divine Spirit . <P> President-Have you parents , wife , children or other relatives ? <P> Assassin-Yes , I have , but that interests only me-and God . <P> President-What is your name ? <P> Assassin-My name is Juan . <P> President-Full name ? <P> Juan-That has not the slightest interest for any one . My name is simply Juan and nothing else . <P> President ( rising and turning disgustedly away ) Ghrh ! ! A Roman Catholic , a mystic ! Useless to question the type ! <P> Meanwhile able Mexican sleuths were ferreting out the name of the assassin-Jose de Leon Toral-and rounding up his whole family as suspects . <P> La Bombilla . No sooner was President Elect Obregon assassinated than Chief of Police Roberto Cruz of Mexico City was relieved of that office on general principles and replaced by the doughty General Antonio Rios Zertuche . " We must keep calm ! " he exclaimed repeatedly to reporters , " We must keep calm . &gt; . . . " <P> Striding into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime . By his stern order not so much as a plate or saucer had been moved . There was the table at which Mexico 's one-armed hero had sat down to luncheon , beaming and bowing amid plaudits . Next to his blood-stained bullet-riddled chair was that upon which had sat Governor Aaron Saenz of Nuevo Leon , conversing jovially with Obregon . <P> Down at the far end of La Bombilla was the side door through which Assassin " Juan " had entered , plying the trade of a street caricaturist . The completed drawing which he had made of the President Elect lay on the table . So did the pistol which had spoken five times from concealment under the caricaturist 's handful of caricatures . <P> The evidence , such as it was , received penetrating scrutiny from would-be-calm General Zertuche . The lines of the sketch , he remarked , were firm and sure , showing no trace of perturbation , and the likeness was recognizable . Scowling thoughtfully ,                 @ @ @ @
