Britannia awaited the Conference of the British Labor Party at Liverpool with expectant nervousness . The recent International Trade Unionist Congress at Scarborough ( TIME , Sept. 21 ) had been stampeded by Communists into adopting a resolution of censure against the entire British Empire . It was rumored that Labor was " going Red . " Gouty peers contemplated the event with misgivings . <P> Communist Showdown . As the <P> Conference opened , Communists rushed to overwhelm it at the start . Although the Labor Party had voted last year to support no Communist candidates for three years , they demanded that the question of whether the Communist Party should become affiliated with the Labor Party be put to vote . Their opponents protested . Undeterred , the Communists forced the matter to a decision . Votes were cast by 1,000 delegates for more than 3,200,000 members of the Labor Party . When their ballots had been counted they were found to stand 2,954,000 " card votes " to 321,000 against the Communists . Automatically British Labor repledged itself to support no " Reds " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communists rallied and succeeded in filling the hall with heated verbiage . First they offered a resolution ordering Mr. MacDonald to apologize to the Soviets because of the action of the Foreign Office in making public the notorious Zinoviev letter , which stampeded the country to Conservatism at the last election . Came a chorus of " Noes ! " and the resolution was quashed . <P> Then Willie Gallacher , Scotch Red , moved to condemn the Labor Party for doing so little to aid the unemployed . Quoth J. Sexton , veteran Laborite : " Ye contribute the magnificent sum of 30 bob to party funds . . . . For that ye want us to start a bloody revolution , establish an international republic , and , I believe , birth control ... ye ca n't get much for 30 bob . Spring us another quid* and we might do it . " Communist Willie vanished amid jeers and laughter . " Jumping Jack " Jones , f famed irrepressible Laborite , topped off the affair by adding his regret that " birth control had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> MacDonald Triumph . From there on , the MacDonald forces held the reins . Whenever the convention showed a tendancy to bolt toward lurid resolutions which might cost the Labor Party votes , Mr. Mac-Donald yanked it promptly back to good behavior . At last , realizing that Mr. Lloyd George awaits eagerly the first clear call to save England from Red Labor , MacDonald arose and rid the Conference of whatever aura of pinkness still hung over it . In a burst of triumphant oratory that recalled the days when he headed England 's first and only Labor Government he cried : " The Communist thesis that the workers should prepare not for an easy parliamentary victory , but for victory by a heavy civil war is an impossible thesis for the Labor Party . The Communists should create their own party . We want the support of none but honest men . "
