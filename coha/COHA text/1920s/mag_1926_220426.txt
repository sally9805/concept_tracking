Some 30 years ago , the late Cornelius Vanderbilt conceived the idea of building himself a $1,000,000 home . He did . Its red brick facade with white stone facing , its handsome wrought iron fence , rise in all their French majesty on the south of Plaza Square , Manhattan , a magnificent pile . " But who , " you ask , " would want to make it his private home ? " Just so . The shutters are up . <P> The taxes on the building in 1899 were $38,446 . Last year they were $129,120 . Naturally Mrs. Vanderbilt wanted to get rid of it . Last year she secured a court order permitting her to sell it for $7,100,000 . A syndicate had offered to purchase it at that price . They put down $500,000 as earnest money . In the syndicate were G. Maurice Heckscher , Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney , grandson of Mrs. Vanderbilt , Leonard Replogle of the steel company of that name , Colonel Henry F. Lindsley , banker and former Mayor of Dallas , Thomas Hitchcock , Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international matches . <P> They formed the " 57th St. and 5th Ave . " Corporation and had plans drawn for a magnificent 55 story hotel . Then they went to bankers to negotiate a loan . The bankers promised to furnish $16,000,000 but wished certain changes made in the plans . They thought that 13 stories should be lopped off the design and some of the splendor eliminated . So plans for a 42 story hotel were prepared . Then for an unpublished reason the members of the syndicate fell out with one another . <P> Last week there was a sudden announcement . Mrs. Vanderbilt had sold the house to Frederick Brown , realtor . He is to pay in full with cash and take title next February . The price was not named . Apparently the syndicate had forfeited its $500,000 . Mr. Brown is a big operator . He has dealt in $35,000,000 worth of real estate in the past few years , although it is said that he came to this country as an immigrant boy with no money and little knowledge of English .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
