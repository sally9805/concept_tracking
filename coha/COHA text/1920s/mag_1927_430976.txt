 | NOTHING in Vermont was as I had expected to find it . Lakes , of course . Yet one lake is much like any other . The mountains were unlike my anticipations and the rivers and the people ? especially the people . Looking back , I see I had been endowed with a composite theory made up of fiction , newspaper articles , some green-moldy plays , and a few baseless impressions . The result was a striking and powerful portrait ? only it was not a portrait of Vermont . As I see it to-day , Vermont 's story is more than a recital of statistics ; it is more than a review of the number of organs and scales manufactured there annually , and far more interesting than an estimate of the number of miles of public buildings which could be faced each year with its marble and granite and roofed with its slate . It has the elements of a drama . It has faced not seven , but seventy , lean years . In the seventy years from 185o to 1920 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 352,428 , or 38,308 ? a little more than 12 per cent . During this same period the increase for the United States as a whole was more than 35o per cent . In the ten years from 1910 to 1920 the number of Vermonters actually decreased . VERMONT IS A TRULY AMERICAN STATE Yet the fture has never seemed so bright , perhaps , to the men and women of the Green Mountains as it does to-day . Vermont can never be rich as is Illinois or Pennsylvania . It must content itself with a more modest prosperity . It may continue to resemble Scotland in sending men from its rugged hills to take their place among the leaders of the Nation . The outsider may , perhaps , be forgiven if he hopes that its prosperity shall be no more than modest , and that it shall not interfere greatly with Vermont 's present status . For it is to-day one of the most truly American of our States . Its people have hardly changed in their essential elements in a century . Barely one in nine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore American . Vermont 's drama is rooted in that fact . Its people are a dynamic lot ? hard-hitting , resourceful , energetic , restless . In the Census of 1790 it was shown that of the 85,072 reported in the total population of 85,425 , approximately 81,200 were of English stock and 2 ; 60o Scotch . The oncoming years brought few different factors . The names one finds today in Vermont were on the earliest records . There was little , to be candid about it , in Vermont to tempt immigration in the last fifty years of the past century . There was everything outside to tempt emigration . The young men left , just as young Scotsmen go to London . THE DAIRY COW HAS DISPLACED THE SHEEP Iowa 's rich prairies called the farmer who had stumbled over Vermont 's rocky hills . Once famed for merino sheep ? it became the inheritor of the Spanish Crown when the royal flocks were dissipated under the threat of Napoleon 's invasion ? it saw them disappear under the pressure of necessity . Sheep held on costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete with those grazed on free land the year round . The million sheep of 185o dwindled to the less than 35,000 of 1925 . Resourceful Vermont was forced to find a substitute for wool growing . The estates located in rich bottom lands were held , of course , but in the pioneer days farmers built cabins on hill shoulders for the sake of the early-morning reassurance of a neighbor 's plume of smoke across the valley . Many of these hill farms became economically impossible . To-day the dairy cow is taking the place sheep once held in Vermont 's scheme of  | things ( see , also , text , page 364 ) . The cow must be fed all winter long ( see page 339 ) , but she abundantly repays . Milk trucks squeak through the winter snows to gather cans at every crossroad . Milk trains roar through the early dawn , bound for the great eastern cities . This achievement has only lately been made possible by the creation of new transportation facilities . Her enormous marble industry ? one shrinks from comparative statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater marble quarries in the world ? had not been thought of . HILL OF MARBLE TRADED FOR A LAME HORSE " The most valuable hill of marble in all Vermont was traded for a lame horse ; and it was years before the spectators to the transaction could be persuaded that the horse-trader did not get the worst of the bargain . " The dignified statehouse at Montpelier , the capital , was built of granite from the famous quarries which have made Vermont the leader among the States in the value of this stone supplied for monumental and structural purposes ( see pages 334 and 350 ) . So , if one sees nothing else in Vermont to-day , he should see the marble quarries and the granite works , where armies of skilled men , equipped with the latest engineering appliances , wrest huge blocks of stone from the State 's rich mountain sides . My own great-grandfather was literally starved out of the village of Lowell , in northern Vermont ; but so were most of the other neighbors . Wagon trains left for Kentucky and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast beds of asbestos in that part of the State . So with talc and slate and the other mineral riches which are now being slowly developed . Nor did any one suspect that her rounded hills and lovely dales would sometime offer a promising vacation ground ? at a profit to the thousands in the great cities within a few hours ' ride ( see Color Plates XII , XIV , and XVI ) . To-day Vermont seems to me to be a cheerful , sunny , independent little State , in which life admittedly presents more difficulties than in the lands wherein one may live on breadfruit . But it is more worth while . It is distinctly not given to hero worship , and it has a pawky humor that might trace to its Caledonian pioneers . A calm , clear-visioned Commonwealth it is , too , with a distaste for rebellion against constituted authority , hut with a fine capacity for it on occasion ; willing that each shall worship God in his own way ; intent upon getting the dollar 's worth , but not falsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days of the easy road . " I wish you 'd tell me what is the matter with my car , " said a New Yorker to a Vermont farmer . The farmer spent two hours under the car , patching a broken feed line . Then the New Yorker asked for the bill . " Well , " said the farmer , " I do n't know . We like to treat strangers right . What do you say to a quarter ? " Incredible ? Not unusual in Vermont . Any traveler can tell of farmhands wakened at midnight to go with stable lanterns to put lost men on their way . Villagers invite the stranger to sleep in the best bedroom and are reluctant to take pay . Let there be no misunderstanding . They do take pay , but they are not so far distant from the pastoral state as not to feel that they have been untrue to their obligations as hosts . VERMONTERS ARE " GOOD FEEDERS " " Might I have more buckwheat cakes ? " I asked the waitress in Newport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the genuine American plan , which permits one to wander gastronomically until flushed cheeks hang out a danger signal . A request for more is taken as a compliment by the cook , for in this cool climate people colloquially describe themselves as " good feeders . " One wonders what may be the license of the table in winter , when the snow lies deep . One authority states the snowfall averages 70 inches , and alleges that in certain parts it rises to 1 io . Doughnuts for breakfast are not a vaudeville joke , but a delectable cate . Nor of a crisp morning , even in the summer , does one disdain a flaky pie . But to return to our buckwheats ,  | " Certainly , " said the pretty waitress , blushing with pleasure . And by and by not only did the cakes materialize , but a tin can , to he taken home filled with genuine buckwheat flour , ground on water-turned stones , together with a detailed recipe for the making , and the address of a farmer whose maple syrup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This may seem an unimportant episode , yet it is illuminative of Vermont . An early writer noted that Vermonters , being bred in a State that for more than a century had been a highway of war , had learned to be " wise , careful , and courteous . " The State seemed to me to have more in common with Kentucky than with its sisters of the New England group . It takes to stock-raising naturally and to agriculture , and its people came from much the same sources . " It was always more democratic than any other New England State , " one reads . " It had no rich and no aristocrats . " One recalls tales of barn-raisings and jugs in Kentucky . A homespun , wholesome , husky democracy . Vermont can match them with the story of Wildersburg , which name became unwelcome to its people . The town meeting voted itself to a tie on the proposed substitutes of Holden and Barre.  | Mark the direct methods of our forbears . Champions were selected to delend the rival titles , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ h e thumping Barre blacksmith won ! SHERIDAN 'S RIDE MADE ON THE GRANDSON OP JUSTIN MORGAN Vermont and Kentucky are both horsy . Morgan blood is not as well known as in the days before machines careered two miles a minute in brick howls , but horsemen know its value . In Vermont any child can tell of Justin Morgan , the big little horse , the one whose grandson Sheridan rode to Winchester , the horse that was " the best horse of his weight . He could outwalk , outtrot , outrun and outpull , . . . " and so on . Justin Morgan plays his part here , because in his glossy sides one may find pioneer conditions mirrored . Race horses did not carry silk in those days , nor did languid ladies clap pretty hands . Their owners gathered at the taverns on Muster Day from the near-by towns , these being what are called townships anywhere else . They drank rum and molasses , or , if they were very hardy pioneers , hot rum and butter , and talked politics , horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best all-round horse . A breathless clash of a few hundred yards would be of no importance in the Vermont mountains . For it is a State of mountains . Ethan Allen once said ? and if Vermont could have a patron saint the Revolutionary hero would comfortably fill that niche ? that " the gods of the valley are not the gods of the hills . " No doubt about it , that hill people are different from valley people . We saw that in the mobilization clays of 1917 , when we compared the men of the prairies with the men of the hills . Not necessarily better , mind you . Just different . Not a single town in Vermont is without its eminence . There are approximately 900 peaks whose summits are 2,000 feet or more above sea level . The northeast  | corner , an area perhaps 50 miles by 5o , is n effect a wilderness . Bears roam there and ( leer , and landlocked salmon are to be caught in lakes rarely seen by man . HOW THE LONG TRAIL WAS BUILT Elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mansfield , 4,393 feet high , can be reached by automobile over good though steep roads and all are accessible to hikers ( see Color Plates XI and XVI ) . One must step aside to tell of the Long Trail . " We should build a trail for hikers along the summit of the Green Mountains from Massachusetts to Canada , " said the men of the Green Mountain Club in 1910 . Therefore they built it . They had little money and there were only a few members of the club ; but in the intervening 16 years they have completed by volunteer and unpaid labor a trail good enough for even a so-so hiker , with cabins and rests at intervals , and along a skyline , over Camels Hump and Mansfield , from which the views bring rapture to a mountain lover ( see illustrations , pp. 344 and 345 ) . It has not , it seems , been regarded as extraordinary by the rest of the State . One gathers that in Vermont one meets a difficulty , subdues it , and goes on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State of lakes , too ; for there are approximately 400 ? from Lake Champlain , 118 miles long , between the Green Mountains and the Adirondacks , to mere potholes gleaming in hill fastnesses ; and of little rapid rivers , which slow down here and there into placid reaches where the hungry trout leap at dawn ( see map , page 340 ) . As one rides through the State , the remains of old water mills are to be seenmoss-grown , picturesque , a warped wheel clattering in a ruined race . Now they are an invitation to the artist . With them are weathered gray houses clustered about by forgotten orchards and dim roads that seem to lead nowhere through tangled woods . One of these days , one fears , there will be humming turbines where the little old mills are now falling into decay . Factories will replace the sagging rooftrees of  | the old houses . Whether we like it or not , this is an age of progress , and these hillside rills and spring-fed mountain lakes will ultimately be harnessed ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEVER ANYTHING BUT FREE " For thirteen years Vermont was an independent republic , making its own laws , maintaining its own army , coining its own money . It was a contumacious and stiff- necked community , for during this period it was not only in rebellion against England , but was carrying on a lively private fight of its own with the State of New York and the Continental Congress . A historian records that " Vermont was never anything but free . Never a crown colony , never yielding allegiance to any province , State , or kingdom . " When she was admitted as the fourteenth State to the American Union , after the Revolution had been won by her loyal aid , it was upon her own terms . Bully little Vermont ! Her written history begins on July 4 , some say July 14. 1609 , on which debatable date Samuel de Champlain discovered t h e lake which bears his name and which is our largest body of fresh water outside the Great Lakes ( see page 349 ) . Okeechobee . Florida , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On that voyage the Sieur de Champlain fought with his Algonquin hosts against the Iroquois , and so assured the friendship of the latter powerful tribe to the British , who were to come later . It has been argued that this may have decided the future overlordship of this continent . Who knows ? The first French settlements on Isle La Motte were not permanent . White men ( lid not come to stay until 1724 , when settlers who had seeped in from the Massachusetts Bay Colony built a blockhouse at Fort bummer , near the site of the present @#  | city of Brattleboro . Here Timothy Dwight was born in 1726 . Three of his descendants through his marriage with Mary , daughter of the Reverend Jonathan Edwards , were to become presidents of Yale . This is worth noting , because Vermont talks more of her men than of her marble or slate or granite . " More than once , " is the cautious statement , " Vermont has furnished a greater number of men to Who 's Who , relative to population , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a royal province , and in 1749 ? it seems unbelievable this was only a century before the discovery of gold at Setters Creek , clear across the continent ? Governor Benning Wentworth began to make land grants west of the Connecticut River . Alert speculators in New York soon persuaded the royal governor of that province to grant them land as far east as the Connecticut River . Because of overlapping claims , the settlers , who had paid for their lands in good faith and who had worked incredibly hard to improve them , were called on to pay again . Men lived hard then . One reads of the plumping mills for the pounding up of samp , or coarse cornmeal , which was the year-round diet of many a pioneer household , eaten with boiled-down maple sap . Some lived for a season on boiled potatoes only . Women worked at weaving for 5o cents a week when calico was 5o cents a yard and six yards went to a dress pattern . The only cash product of many farms was the " salts , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of salts , which involved the handling of no one knows how many tons of wood and ash , were salable for $3 to $5.50 . Under such conditions men learn the  |  true value of money . They were a husky lot , who had moved from the older Colonies in the search for independence . Connecticut had aided the movement by trying to tax Dissenters for the support of the church , but most had dared the wilderness because of a hunger for land . They defied the New York claimants . Eventually the King 's Privy Council conceded the legality of their position , but by this time the situation had been complicated by the introduction of political elements . " THE WESTMINSTER MASSACRE " Much talk of liberty , unfair taxation , and the blunder-headed tyranny of the king 's officers was heard . Republicanism was growing in New England , and there were fiery outbursts even in the comparatively Tory colony of New York . The land speculators and the royal governors who aided them were frowned upon by the King 's Council , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England rather than to New England , and it was no time to be alienating friends by insistence upon strict justice . Failing to receive protection from the courts , the men of the New Hampshire Grants defended themselves . They " sealed with the green twigs of the wilderness " the bare backs of New York 's invading sheriffate . Some historians argue that in the " Westminster Massacre " in March , 1775 , the first blood of the American struggle for independence was shed . The English court was perturbed by this armed resistance to uniformed law , while the sentiment in Westminster may be read in the epitaph over William French 's grave : Here William French his Body lies For Murder his Blood for Vengeance cries King George the Third his Tory Crew Tha with a Bawl his Head shot threw For Liberty and his Countrys good He lost his life his dearest blood . This rebellion was at its height when the Colonies took up arms . Vermont rebelled with them , without prejudice to  | the violence of her sentiments against New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress that they were able to prevent the acceptance of Vermont as a State , although it was made welcome in the field with its flintlocks . Confronted by two enemies , its leaders occasionally resorted to diplomacy . Letters exchanged with the British command prevented an invasion at a time when , as Ira Allen explained , " A few days were very material to the farmers in getting their winter wheat into the ground . " Ethan Allen was somewhat less apologetic than his brother , and gave the Continental Congress to understand that the colony stood upon its rights . " Vermont , " he wrote , " would of all people be the most miserable if she were obliged to defend the independence of the united claiming States and they at the same time at full liberty to overturn and ruin the independence of Vermont . Rather than fail , I will return with the hardy Green Mountain Boys into the desolate caverns of the mountains and wage war with human nature at large . " The feud with New York was not composed until 1791 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new Nation . By this time the characteristics of this sturdy stock of English and Scotch , stepped up , as an electrician would say , by generations of pioneering , were firmly fixed . The natives had learned to manage their affairs well . By the system taken from Connecticut , the town rather than the county was the unit of government , which insured the active participation of every citizen . A STATE OE DISTINGUISHED SONS The Bradford Social Library Society boasts that it was the first incorporated body of the kind . Concord Corner claims , to have had the first normal school in the United States . Justin S. Morrill , United States Senator , fathered the American system of agricultural colleges . If one begins to name the distinguished sons of the State , one fears to be overwhelmed ; yet it must be remembered that  | for decades they were almost the only exportable product , and have left their traces everywhere through American history . The list includes such names as Calvin Coolidge , President of the United States , born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two small stores , a few houses , and a wandering lane ; Grace Goodhue Coolidge , his gracious and accomplished wife ; Alphonso Taft , Attorney General of the United States , Secretary of War , and father of President , now Chief Justice , William Howard Taft ; John G. Sargent , Attorney General of the United States , of the little town of Ludlow ; Chester A. Arthur , VicePresident and later President ; Stephen A. Douglas , Lincoln 's opponent for the Presidency ; Thaddeus Stevens , noted statesman of the Reconstruction era ; and Hiram Powers , the sculptor . Because Admirals Dewey and Clark were both Vermonters , a wit called one war , that " between the Town of Montpelier and the Kingdom of Spain . " The list also includes Frederick Billings , president of the Northern Pacific Railway ; John G. Saxe , poet ; and Levi P. Morton , Vice-President of the United States . Horace Greeley learned his trade in Poultney . There were , likewise , H. C. Ide , Governor General of the Philippines ; Dean Richmond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the Adams Express Company ; Thomas Davenport , inventor of the electric motor ; and Joseph Smith , founder of the Mormon Church .  | Green Mountain natives , too , are Louis Sherry , arbiter of the New York palate when Delmonico ceased to be great ; Fanny B. Kilgore , the first woman lawyer , and Samuel Morey , whom Vermonters believe was the real inventor of the steamboat . The list might be extended indefinitely . GEMMED WITH UNSPOILED LOVELINESS So much for the background against which the present act is being played . Vermont has no such reservoirs of wealth to tax for public improvements as have some other States . But she has the deep love of her proud people ready to make sacrifices for her civic , educational , agricultural , and industrial advancement . Yet , even as the economic shift about the time of our Civil War sapped Vermont 's strength , a recent change in con- ditions is beginning to rebuild it . I have indicated the prosperity of her great industries . The State which is so gemmed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great eastern centers of population must inevitably become a summer playground . Two systems of main highways traverse the State from north to south , one on either side of the Green Mountain range . Byroads cross the chain of hillat intervals , so that one may visit almost every town without inconvenience . During the summer these roads are good . For the most part they are of gravel or stone and well cared for . As the State is but 157 miles long from north to south and , on an average . but 58 miles wide , one may easily zigzag from the southern edge to the Canadian  | boundary in the term of a day 's drive ( see map , page 340 ) . During that day one will now and then encounter a pretty village in which the New England tradition of white houses set under green maple and elm is carried out . Not too many villages nor many larger towns , for in her 9,564 square miles Vermont , in 1920 , counted but fourteen places of more than 2,500 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Census , exceeded 10,000 inhabitants . Everywhere is the reminder of a common ancestry . Not only are the place names to be found to-day in Devon and Essex and the Highlands of Scotland , but Vermont has a way of repeating village names , as England has . There are Middlebury Town and Middlebury Village , Bennington Town , Bennington Center , and North Bennington , Lyndon Town , Lyndon Center , and Lyndonville , Ryegate and South Ryegate . St. Albans , Chester , Tinmouth , and a score of others are to be found to-day on English maps . THE NEW SPIRIT IN VERMONT We discovered the new spirit in Vermont almost as soon as we entered the parklike reaches in the southwestern corner , which , with their swelling moors and wooded hills , inevitably provoke reference to older lands . Bennington is one of the elder towns , for the first church in Vermont was built here in 1766 . There were indications , here and there . of the financial doldrums through which the State has passed . A gray cabin on a hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once led to a pioneer homestead . But this was only proof that Vermont is jettisoning the stale old things out of harmony with to-day . There are new-laid streets in Bennington , new houses , and an air of briskness . But it is true that the unbusinesslike memory will cling longer to the recollection of Monument Hill , upon which is the 366-foot shaft commemorating the Battle of Bennington , as well as to the brilliant border of old-fashioned flowers around it , and the arching trees over the colonial houses near the former site of the Green Mountain Tavern . Vermont 's forbears had a merry way  | of hoisting a tied Tory in an armchair to the staff in front of the inn until he swung alongside its famous sign , a stuffed catamount . This treatment , it is recorded , invariably produced a cure for his political disorder . The signs of the renaissance persisted up the western road through the fat valley of the Champlain . Here were new orchards , there a new barn with ensilage towers gathered about it . One was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a bevy of reflective dairy cows , well-bred ladies of a supercilious calm . They are of immense importance in the story of Vermont to-day , for upon them much of to-morrow 's prosperity depends . Figures are to be feared at any time , but the Census reports show there are 40,000 more cattle in Vermont than there are people . Yet it is obvious that the dairying possibilities of the State have only been trenched upon . Later we were to exclaim at the loveliness encountered at each turn of the road . I shall always remember the day 's drive from Burlington to Montpelier . Much of the way it followed a high road from which we looked down upon a broad stream forever checked and harried by rock barriers until it paused to meditate in long , slow sweeps that mirrored bending trees . Another drive led from Montpelier , through Roxbury , toward Plymouth , that pinpoint of a village in which the President of the United States was born . Here the road at times so closely bordered  | a trout stream that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet if one begins to compare charm with charm , there will be no ending . THE LITTLE RED SCHOOLHOUSE IS GOING In the lake valley the manifest financial growth of the State impressed us . Here were new schoolhouses , replacing the little red structures of our fathers . Nor may the departed be greatly mourned except by poets and convinced advocates of the " good old days . " The little red schoolhouses were dying forlorn by the roadside . Not red any longer ; usually no paint had blessed them within the memory of living man . They were small , insanitary , freezingly cold in this land where four feet of snow on the roads is a winter commonplace , and dustily hot in summer . The new district schools may lack something of romance , but are beyond comparison for educational purposes . Vermont 's percentage of illiteracy among the native-born ten years of age and over is but I.I , one of the low records for the United States , according to 1920 Census figures . The ride through the valley abounded in reminders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny villages which had dozed since Revolutionary times are being revivified by the tourists that the automobile is bringing to their old inns , to the filling station or refreshment booth . Not far from Bennington , for instance , is the once busy village of Stratton , now almost forgotten . Yet in the HarrisonTyler campaign of 1840 Daniel Webster addressed there a gathering of 15,000 Whigs . Everywhere the past is jostled by modern progress . Near Manchester is the hamlet of Shaftsbury , where the first steel square was made for carpenters . One again deprecates the unhistoric tendency of one 's memory . It is Manchester that is recalled , with white pillared hotels gleaming against a background of great trees , its marble sidewalks and Mount Equinox looming in the distance .  | One recalls , too , the anglers who sat upon the porch and told of the day 's sport with a multitude of technical terms as bewildering as the talk of a young doctor . It w as not until the next day that the listener recovered from a consciousness of his inferiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delightful valley of the West River , he saw an impish , ragged , graceless little boy catching trout with worms not fifty yards from an anguished angler who was catching nothing at all with two hundred dollars ' worth of doodads ! On the Lake Champlain side of the Green Mountains are Rutland and Proctor , where are the marble quarries . I have not the faintest idea whether these are really the largest in the world , nor do I greatly care . It is interesting to k n o w , however , that there are Too varieties of marble found here , running through the colors of the spectrum , and some of the polished stones were almost jewellike in their luster ( see page 335 ) . Hereabouts , too , is the town of Weybridge , where the United States maintains a farm for the breeding of Morgan horses . Handsome creatures they are . " He can eat his grain out of a tin cup , " said a stableman of his charge . Hardly that , perhaps , but the broad forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vermont 's largest city , has an unsurpassed location on the shores of Lake Champlain , here To miles wide and diked on the other side by the blue summits of the Adirondacks . The town itself is dignified and fine . Ira Allen , that extraordinary man who had formed a commonwealth at an age when most young men are leaving college . founded the college for the sons of farmers here , which was to be opened to students in i800 as the University of Vermont . It maintains its tradition of able teaching and high standards . There are also Middlebury College and other institutions which , with Vermont 's excellent public schools , are contributing greatly to her steady development . It is to my mind no indictment of the State that the number of farms in operation decreased in the 15 years preceding  | 1925 from 32,709 to 27.786 . The young man who has learned in college the profession of farming does not battle unrelenting Nature with the savage fury of the pioneer , who had but an ax and rifle as tools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a local farm that can be made profitable rather than to break his heart on stony hills . A MINIATURE ISLE Or MAN The proof is that in the same period referred to above the value of Vermont 's farms increased from 8145,399,728 to $i8o , - 911,645 . More farms are being operated by their owners , too , for tenancy decreased from 12.3 per cent in 1910 to 9.3 in 1925 . The abandoned farms , delightfully picturesque , for the most part , are being sold to summer visitors . And each visitor wants milk , butter , and eggs . Not far from Burlington is Grand Isle County , a miniature Isle of Man in the waters of Lake Champlain . One reaches it by a sand-bar bridge and drives for hours over hills which roll in billows to the water 's edge . Two ferries over narrow necks of water return one to the main road , on which is St. Albans . This tree-shaded town , sparkling with quaint old flowers , the very names of which are unknown to the present generation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . Confederate raiders swept its banks . of $200,000 and escaped to Canada , thereby producing an international incident . In the valley of the Lamoille is a picture road that leads north through ever-green hills , deep-cupped meadows , and gray old farms set in protecting cliffs . Everywhere are indications of returning prosperity . This was a logging country once ; then a sheep country ; and , with both logs and sheep gone , depression came . Yet the farmers held on , and not an undue share report a mortgage debt . We did not gather , I believe , a baseless optimism from those with whom we talked , but rather an understanding that the new wine is being put in new vessels , and that the cracked old pots are being scrapped . At Newport one may wander toward Lake Memphremagog , 30 miles long , and Lake Willoughby , a blue-green gem  | under that Mount Pisgah , on whose summit the Rev.

THL MAPLE-SUGAR COUNTRY Toward St. Johnsbury , over roads that wind down lovely valleys and by the shores of placid lakes , one invades the heart of the maple-sugar country . It came somewhat as a shock to learn that a census had been taken of the sugarmaple trees , and that 5,000,000 more or less are working , while equally that many are luxuriating in forest idleness . It is , one understands , an industry which may enter the major class when tree owners properly appreciate their opportunities . Even now , the insidious odors of boiling syrup reach the traveler on the way , for almost every farmwife is a manufacturer on a small scale ( see page 358 ) . The economic betterment noted in the Valley of Champlain was visible in its counterpart on the eastern side of the mountains , the delectable Valley of the Connecticut .

Sometimes the road wound high among the hills and sometimes descended to march demurely through an ancient , covered bridge through whose latticed sides the sun checkerboarded the resounding floor . Notably fertile , even in Indian times , when the tribes made long marches to burn off its meadows and plant their fields of corn , it is not so much for its agricultural abundance as for its beauty that it is remembered . The Vermont winter must be considered ? long , cold , and cruel , in which the snow heaps high against the homestead 's walls . Farmhouses in this part of the country are self-contained units ; so that the farmer need never go out from under a roof from snowfall to thaw . Snowmobiles are in reserve everywhere , an adaptation of small automobiles , with caterpillar treads and sled runners , which are of service until the snow is two feet deep or more ( see illustration , page 351 ) . Then snorting Morgan horses are harnessed to the pungs . That the farms are lonely during winter is admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 360 ) , and it often happens that rural homes are isolated by the deep snows for the better part of the season . The mercury sinks to depths unbelievable to a city dweller , when the forest trees burst , riflelike , with the chill of night . The country doctor makes his rounds on snowshoes , as does the rural mailcarrier . Outside of the manufacturing towns and the quarry centers social life must amble slowly , in spite of singing schools and taffy pulls . Yet , as the owner of a little farm in a hollow on the very brow of a mountain ? it was an adventure to climb to that elevation with a car , even in summer ? said : " The winters are savage and I am getting old . The frost gets into my bones . But ? I do n't know ? one has so much time for reading and for thought . " In the long , cold winters , perhaps , lies the secret of Vermont 's strength .
