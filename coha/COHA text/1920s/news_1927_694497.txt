txt The Board of Estimate decided yesterday at a meeting of its Committee of the Whole to put the tracks of the Atlantic Avenue Division of the Long Island Railroad underground to eliminate thirty of the most dangerous grade crossings in the city and to make a boulevard on Atlantic Avenue providing an unobstructed thoroughfare leading to Jamaica and the Rockaways . The board 's decision was a result of the increase in the city 's borrowing margin because of the adoption at the election last Tuesday of the constitutional amendment to enable the city to borrow $300,000,000 be ' yond its debt limit for the construe ' tion of new subways . The resolution before the board contained the recommendation of Arthur S. Tuttle , its chief engineer , for the depression of the tracks and the construction of a retaining wall sufficiently heavy to hold a boulevard roof . Project to Cost $26,000,000 . The project , with the roof added , is estimated to cost $26,000,000 . Of this amount $18,500,000 is chargeable to the cost of grade crossing elimination , according to Mr. Tuttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retaining walls and roof . Under the grade crossing elimination law , one-half the expense is borne by the railroad company and one-fourth each by the city and State . The cost of constructing the retaining walls and roof will be borne entirely by the city . The Board seemed about to adopt the $26,000,000 plan when Philip P. Farley , consulting engineer to the Borough President of Brooklyn , asserted that the proposed depression would not provide sufficient space above the railroad tracks and under the surface of the boulevard for gas and water pipes and other sub-surface conduits . He urged that the tracks be placed in a tunnel similar to a subway tunnel so that there would be room for the pipes below the surface of the roadway . The cost of a subway-type tunnel will be from $4,000,000 to $6,000,000 greater . Mayor Walker seemed impressed by the argument and Mr. was appointed a committee of one to examine the two plans and report back to the Board .
