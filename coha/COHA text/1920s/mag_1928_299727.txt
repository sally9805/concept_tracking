On Bastille Day ( July 14 ) , 1918 , there were 16 planes nosing in and out of the clouds above a battle sector along the river Marne . Seven were German planes , nine U. S. The shooting , tailspinning and climbing lasted two hours . When the U. S. planes returned behind their lines , they numbered only eight . The pilot-fighter of the missing plane was Lieut . Quentin Roosevelt , not yet 21 , son of a fighting U. S. President . <P> Two days later , the following German wireless message was intercepted by the Allies : " Lieut . Roosevelt , . . . who had shown conspicuous bravery during the fight by attacking again and again without regard to danger , was shot in the head two bullets by his more experienced opponent and fell at Chamery . " <P> Germans-1,000 of them , in spiked helmets , standing at attention-buried Lieut . Roosevelt with full military honors at Chamery . <P> The death of Lieut . Roosevelt was used to hearten German troops . An official bulletin was distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRESIDENT OF <P> THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , <P> ROOSEVELT , FOUND DEAD IN AN AERIAL <P> FIGHT ON THE MARNE <P> The bulletin added that the flier who had killed Lieut . Roosevelt was Non-Commissioned Officer Greper . Herr Greper received 20 bullet holes in his plane during the fight . He lived through the War , was killed accidentally while delivering planes to the U. S. forces after the Armistice . <P> Admirers of Killer Greper were made angry , when a German turned up at Hadley Flying Field , N. J. , last week , and boasted that he had killed Quentin Roosevelt . The boaster called himself " Captain Jack von Wiegand . " Soon exposed , he ate his boast , whined , " If I really had shot down Quentin Roosevelt , I would n't have come here . I knew how much the name Roosevelt means to the American people . "
