txt Last Tuesday the cotton market was treated to two important items of news of opposite effect . One was the Census Bureau 's report showing an enormous domestic consumption in May . The other v. as that of rains in western and northwestern Texas . which heretofore had been unduly dry . These opposing influences give an Interesting puzzle to the cotton market . Domestic consumption for May was 633.024 bales of lint . Besides being a record for May , this brings the total consumption for the first ten months of the season up to 3,970,844 bales exclusive of linters . The great consumption of the whole season of 1922-23 was 6.666,093 bales of lint Plainly , our domestic consumption is headed toward the 7,000,000 bale mark . It is true that domestic consumption may be overdone , resulting in a depression for the new season . In such case history would be but repeating itself . But for the present there is no such indication , if we take the New York Association of Cotton Textile Merchants ' figures for April as authority . Compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent. , sales increased 49 per cent .. stocks of goods decreased 35 per cent ; unfilled orders at the end of the month were double those of the preceding period . The Census Bureau 's report of exports of cotton was as bullish as the consumption figures . For the month of May they were 628.132 bales , which brought the total for ten months up to 10,312,637 bales . Domestic mills and exports have taken considerably more than 16,000,000 bales from the market in ten months . In May they were taking cotton from the domestic market at rate of 1,250 , - 000 bales a month . At the end of the season , July 30 , how much of the crop of 17,911,000 bales will be left ? Large as the crop was , it has been melting away like frost under the morning sun . On the other hiind there was the announcement of rains in the drought afflicted regions . Perhaps this is good news , but as there were rains in the central and eastern belt where they were not welcome , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rains leave the situation open to argument . Drought in western and northwestern Texas , although not so spectacular , means far more to the cotton crop than the Mississippi flood . That region , which is a great producer , has been without rains for months . Seed has not germinated well , and planting is not completed . It is possible that western Texas will produce a large crop , but there is an unusual element of uncertainty . The South Plain is a high plateau , while the Cap Rock in the Panhandle is still higher . The latter region is as high as the average of the mountain tops of the Adirondacks . This means that frosts are likely to come at an early date . Probably a big crop will be seen growing , but the doubt is in its ripening . Will world takings continue at present rate ? Will present crop prospects materialize ? Here is the puzzle . No one can answer it yet .                   @ @
