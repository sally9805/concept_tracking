In Mexico City , Lieut . Joaquin Garcia Bolanos of the Mexican air force died last week defending the good names of President Portes Gil and U. S. Ambassador Dwight Whitney Morrow . Returning home late at night , Lieutenant Bolanos saw some rough-looking men pasting up posters insulting to the President and the Ambassador . Lieutenant Bolanos went home and told his father . They returned to the scene , remonstrated . Aviator Bolanos rushed forward and attempted to wrest the offensive posters from one of the men . The billsticker drew a pistol and shot him dead . Despite the sacrifice of Aviator Bolanos , police next morning discovered hundreds of insults to Ambassador Morrow pasted about the city . <P> Meanwhile the Mexican revolution ( TIME , March 11 et seq. ) was rapidly petering out . The diminished rebel army under General Jos Gonzalo Escobar retained control of only one state , Sonora . Federal General Juan Andreu Almazan was collecting an army of 10,000 men to complete the mopping up .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
