txt The choice collection of epithets which most of the nessspapers of Germany have seen fit to shower upon Mr. WILSON as be lay dead in Washington ought not to be misunderstood . Their chief intent is not to affront the United States or outrage AnieriCan sentiment , but to maintain a German myth . This is that Germany was not beaten in the war . The legend upon which the German people have been fed is that they were betrayed . The armistice would not have been signed , so runs the tale . had not Germany been deceived as regards the terms of peace that would be imposed Upon her . As it is still considered of the utmost importance to keep up the belief of Germans in this strong delusion , the present occasion is seized to represent President WILSON as the man who dishonorably lured Germany to her doom . The abuse heaped upon him in Germany today is thus meant for home consumption . It would never do to allow Germans to suspect that their military power had been dashed to pieces before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude is what most Americans will feel . The facts are of record . in assenting as they did to Mr. WitsoN 's Fourteen Points . the German authorities agreed in advance to submit to the stipulations which were Most galling to German pride and most destructive of German lust for domination . Marshal Focx is supposed to know something about military affairs , and it was he who described the German signature to the terms of the armistice as an " unconditional surrender . " All the world , except Germany . knows this to be true . But that country has endeavored to establish the tradition that it lost the war through trickery , not through force of Elms . It fears that this might be challenged afresh in connection with Mr. WILSON 'S death . and so it takes to shouting once more " betrayal . " This gives the world one more glimpse into the mighty and mysterious deeps of German mentality and good taste ; but all the railing will not remove even a portion of the seal that has been affixed to the truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
