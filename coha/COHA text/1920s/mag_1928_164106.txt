More than 150 lives were saved by parachutes last year , and so a week ago Sergeant Archie Atherton , crack parachutist of the U. S. Marine Corps , opened a school for parachuting in San Diego , Calif . Sergeant Atherton is known as the originator of " spot landing " and averaged a drop a day for a year . <P> <P> Lt. Eyre reached for his map , missed it ; it slipped into a corner of his cockpit . Two thousand feet over Essex , England , he undid his safety straps and reached again . Unintentionally he pressed the control stick forward . The plane stalled with a start and an astonished flier found himself catapulted into midair . With presence of mind he pulled his parachute cord , landed unhurt , lighted a cigaret , and addressed a gaping rustic : " I wonder where my kite 's gone .

J. , in a mail plane , completing the trip in 34 hours ' flying . <P> Landing is far more difficult than flying , but new instruments tested last week in Paris promise to make it easy . Henry Farman , air pioneer , and half a dozen French army pilots tested instruments that can be used in darkest night or fog , because they make sight unnecessary . Where the pilot has confidence that a clear field lies below , he can trust the new instruments to register exact distances from the ground . <P> Five thousand ports of shelter are now available for American airmen . The Department of Commerce last week listed 1,075 airports and nearly 4,000 other fields adequate for landing . California leads the nation with 115 air fields , Texas has 90 , and Pennsylvania 68 . <P> Schools are also plentiful , the biggest being in Marshall , Mo. , the Marshall Flying School , now in its third year , with 263 students .                 @ @ @ @
