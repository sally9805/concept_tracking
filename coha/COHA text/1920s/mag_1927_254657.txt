With the years a spacious legend , heavy with the frankincense of gold , has grown up in grey Wall Street about the New Year 's Eve of the great House of Morgan . It is told that as the old year passes the Morgan partners assemble in the low chunky marble building which stands at Broad and Wall Streets , the solid fulcrum of the business world . They come to sit in quiet , awful council while Mr. Morgan apportions to each his share of the firm 's profits for the previous year . Naturally the largesse of a Morgan is always large . To this partner several hundred thousand dollars ; to that one a million ; to another a million and a half . Part of the legend is , of course , that no partner ever questions Mr. Morgan 's division of earnings . The tale is one that captures the glamorous imaginations of Wall Street men who like to think themselves prosaic . There is less truth in it than in the fable of King Midas whose touch turned all to gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , groundless . <P> None the less , last week this legendary Morgan Eve was the occasion for a crisp announcement to the press . It read : " Mr. Francis Dwight Bartow , Mr. Arthur Marvin Anderson and Mr. William Ewing , who have hitherto held procuration for our firm in New York , are this day admitted as partners in our firms in New York ( J. P. Morgan &; Co . ) , Philadelphia ( Drexel &; Co . ) , London ( Morgan , Grenfell &; Co. ) and Paris ( Morgan &; Co. * ) . " <P> To these three men the bestowal of the " golden touch " would seem commonplace beside the marvel of their promotion . Never before have Morgan employes been made Morgan partners. + Horatio Alger imagined for his self-made dime novel heroes no such dizzying climb to altitudes of power . <P> Dozens of other investment houses changed their personnel at the New Year , most notably Dillon , Read &; Co. , rapidly becoming a potent , daring rival of J. P. Morgan &; Co . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where U. S. tourists stop for mail and money-changing . Henry Herman Harjes died last year and in consequence the firm name had to be changed , for a French law forbids a dead man 's name being exploited . Mr. Harjes left two sons , who have not been admitted to partnership . So their names may not be utilized . <P> +Exception : Partner George Whitney once worked for the firm , but his uncle was a full partner .
