Once an offer of a half-billion was tendered and Mr. Ford laughed at that , said Mr. Prentiss , who added that one of the offers of $1,000,000,000 made by , his firm of bankers , and refused , tools place within the last thirty days . The witness , who is a former Presed dent of the Investment Bankers ' . Ae . sociation of America , saidthat even today the offer stands .

Mr. Prentiss was called to testify tee the worth of Ford stock . The as ? sessment and the appeal are based on the value of the stock as of March , 1913 . The Bureau of Internal Revee nue , in order to facilitate the 1919 sale , fixed a value of $9,489 for 1913 . The Treasury Department now con. tends that the value should have bees fixed at $3,500 a share . Describes Other Notable Successes . Before he launched into the Ford matter he was qualified as an expert in securities and their values , especially , in the automobile field , by Joseph 111 , Davies , former Commissioner of Cory sorations , who conducts the examine . tion of witnesses for the fifteen other lawyers appearing for the appellants . During that time he lifted the edge of the curtain on several big motor deals , and in a phrase or two sketched an industrial rise as remarkable as the Ford career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who put $100,000 Into a steel mill turning out bearings in 1901. and made millions . " Did you ever make an offer to buy the Ford Motor Car Company ? " asked Mr. Davies . " Several . " said Mr. Prentiss , with e , smile ? " once in 1916 , once in 1924 , again in 1925 , and the last one within the last thirty days  --  in fact , since these hearings have been on . In 19113 I went to Detroit and saw C. Harold Wills , one of the pripcipals of the Ford company . I asked him to introduce me to Mr. Ford . We talked awhile and then , as I was sitting in Mr. Wills 's office , Mr. Ford suddenly , bobbed into the room . Offer Stirred Ford 's Mirth . " Naturally , I had not expected to seal him quite so soon and it took me oft my feet . Mr. Wills introduced met however , and Mr. Ford said to me : ' Mr. Prentiss , what is your business ?

" I told him that he should recapita ? lize his company at $500,000,000 and that Hornblower &; Weeks would be glad to take all or any part of it . Mrs Ford laughed at me . " The next attempt was in 1924 . Then Mr. Prentiss made his approach through Stuart Webb , an official of the Old Colony Trust Company of Boston . It was Mr. Webb who con. ducted the negotiations which led to the minority sale to the Fords in 1919 for approximately $80,000,000 . This time the offer was a billion dollars . The Webb offer was laid before Edsel Ford by Howard Bonbright , an investment banker of Detroit . Edsel Ford turned it down . The next year the offer was renewed through Bonbright , with the same result . " Within the last thirty days , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sistent reports in the Street , reports which came to me individually , that the Ford family were thinking of re . capitalizing their stock .

" In describing the various finvelaj matters he had Rarticipatod in for tug benefit of motors Mr. Prentiss recalled the Hudson recapitalization and the syndicate formed , in 1910 for General Motors , with his firm , J. &; W. Seligman and Lee , Higginson &; Co. participating . In discussing a deal in Chevrolet stock in August , 1915 , when W. C. Durant was at the wheel , the witness said : " It was Durant 's ambition to develop a company with his car , which he called after its price , the ' $490 , ' to compete with Ford , something that up to that time had never been tried . His car was said to be a second Ford , and it has pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been closely in . touch with automotives , and the Ford company in particular , during the period between 1907 and 1913 . Mr. Davies asked him what had been the reputation of the Ford company . " It was the best motor car company in the world , " said the witness , " as far as profits were concerned ; it was a wonder to the community . Even In 1907 , when we had a tremendous panic in this country , the motor industry and the Ford went right ahead undisturbed . In March , 1913 , the Ford stock was worth more than Studebaker and General Motors put together . " Puts 1913 Value at $250,000,000 . The examining attorney then put the hypothetical question , half an ' hour in length , which has prefaced every effort to get a witness to give a value to - Ford stock for 1913 . " My opinion would be , " said Mr. Prentiss , " that the Ford company in 1913 was worth $250,000,000 , which would make the stock value $12,500 a share . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been willing to pay that ? " " I would have been delighted . " " Why ? " " Well , Hornblower &; Weeks , like every other house , were looking at this company , unquestionably the greatest development in the world . It had a record of 900 per cent . increase , in business in nine years . It was producing the best method of general transportation in the world and doing so at a low price . The field was virtually unlimited . The company was so far ahead in business and in management that there was no comparison . " Then , there is the matter of credit . I 'd say that the Ford Motor Car Company as a credit proposition equals the United States Steel Corporation , the Standard Oil Company , the General Electric and General Motors . It did not have to go to the bankers and it was continually selling its product cheaper . " From the banker 's standpoint and considering this matter of credit , you ca : : pay more for Ford securities than inother motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great General Motors Company . " Thinks Holders Sold Too Low . Taken over for cross-examination by Alexander W. Gregg , general counsel for the Treasury Department , the witness said that he thought the company worth $1,000,000,000 now . Mr. Gregg hinted that Wall Street , supposedly anxious to acquire Ford stock , had overlooked a bet in 1919 . " Assuming that the minority stockholders tried to sell their stock in Wall Street in 1919 , " he said to the witness , " and failed to sell it and upon This failure were forced to sell to the Fords for $12.500 a share , would this alter your opinion that the stock in 1919 was worth $37,500 a share ? " " It does not ; I think they sold too cheaply , " said Mr. Prentiss . The attorney then examined the witness on the condition of the stock market in 1912 and 1913 and when it developed that the market had been siuggish , asked whether it would not have been difficult to dispose of even Ford stock at that ' time . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford stock to the people of these United States at any time , It was the marvel of the age . " Mr. Prentiss , in response to a question , valued the company at $200,000. - 000 in 1912 . Mr. Gregg then delved into a memorandum and fixed the 1912 earnings of the company at $7,500,000 . " In other words , " he said , " you think , you could have sold the company for something like twenty-five times its earnings ? " Sees No Saturation Point . " Yes , " said Mr. Prentiss , " we have a lot of statisticians digging up figures for you , but the growth of that company absolutely transcends any statistics you might apply . " " You think Hornblower &; Weeks could have sold it for that rate ? " persisted the attorney . " We 'd like to have taken a shot at it , " said the witness with emphasis . In reply to another question , Prentiss denied that the " saturation point " bad been reached in automobiles . " I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the witness was asked if he had ever heard of another company that had yielded 100 per cent . consistently for years he cited two . " There was the Timken Brothers who put $100,000 in 1901 into a steel mill at St. Louis , " he said . " The company is selling at $100,000 , - 000 , it has paid $45,000,000 in dividends and has $17,000,000 in banks , and a plant valued at $45,000,000 . Up to its recapitulation it always paid 100 per cent . Then there is the Household Products Company , makers of Castoria , and Dr. Caldwell 's syrup of pepsin . That yielded $2,500,000 a year on a capitalization of $2,500,000 . " Dr. David Friday , a lecturer on political economy at Brookings Graduate School of Political Economy , Washington , was called . He valued the Ford stock as of March 1 , 1913 , at $12,000 a share . He was being cross-examined by J. F. Graeney ; assistant counsel in the Treasury Department , when adjournment was taken .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
