THE FORTUNATE WAYFARER-E . Phillips Oppenheim-Little Brown ( $2.00 ) . <P> Eighty thousand pounds-and yet by the merest chance had Martin Barnes , commercial traveler , strolled out of his shabby hotel , and past the strange old house . But Lord Ardrington , on the point of death , was contemptuous alike of charities and his rightful heir , and chose therefore to bestow the 80,000 , in notes , upon the first passerby . Martin , filling that simple requirement , walked out of his commercial existence into a congenial life of valets , and books , and motor cars , but no friends . This might soon have palled had he not become further involved with his benefactor-who did not die after all . Years before , the exciting climax to Lord Ardrington 's checkered career in South America had been a bitter trick played on his two partners , villains both . These two worked their way to prosperity as American bootleggers , and came at last to London , still snarling and snorting for revenge . Their sophisticated method was the slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that black-eyed mignon , Ardrington 's adopted daughter . They employed for their villainous purposes thugs from London 's underworld , and a beautiful Spanish matron whom they installed at the Ritz . But they had not reckoned with Martin 's cool audacity , nor his marriageability , nor the girl he loved . And they had not reckoned with Oppenheim 's suave agility in leading his knaves through smooth intricacies to their just desserts . <P> Last year Author Oppenheim passed his literary centennial , and still his pen flows pleasantly on , delighting tired doctor , lawyer , merchant , businessman . Though his 103 plots bear a family resemblance , they are often distinguished , as here , by novel features of mystery and intrigue .
