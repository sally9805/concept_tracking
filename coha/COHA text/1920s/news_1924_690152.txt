txt " The Chrysalis . " Knowing that Tun TIMES never intends to give its readers incorrect impressions , I want to call your attention to part of a headline appearing in this morning 's edition on a. story about the unveiling of Carl Akeley 's statue " The Chrysalis . " This reads , in part : " Unveiling of his bronze ape , in church . " These words give an erroneous impression of the propriety of having the statue in the church . Mr. Akeley 's statue is not that of an ape , but of a. man emerging Irom , and rising above , his animal ancestry , into the human form for which the great Creator ultimately intended him . A Unitarian Church is a fitting place for this beautiful statue , which is symbolic of one of the cardinal beliefs of Unitarianism , namely faith in the " continuous progress of mankind onward and upward forever , " a faith which sees God as the Master Workman , of far vision and careful plan .
