Jack and Jill have a poultry farm , Where all the fowls walk arm in arm ; They do n't worry and they you- Cock-a-doodle-doodle-doo ! ! <P> CHORUS <P> What 's the song they sing on Sunday ? <P> Eggs ! Eggs ! Eggs ! What 's the song they sing on Monday ? <P> Eggs ! Eggs ! Eggs ! <P> Hear the hens laugh- Cluck ! Cluck ! Cluck ! Foreign yolks have come unstuck ! One egg , two eggs , three for luck- <P> Eggs ! Eggs ! Eggs ! <P> <P> This jolly song was heard every night last week by every Briton who tuned in on the London Daily Express 's patriotic Egg Hour . Thus one of the Empire 's great newspapers rallied to Her Majesty the Queen-Empress who recently signed an order in council ( TIME , Feb. 25 ) decreeing that : <P> " It shall not be lawful to import any hen or duck eggs in shell into the United Kingdom , nor to sell or expose for sale in the United Kingdom any imported hen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of origin . <P> " The indication of origin shall be conspicuously and durably marked in ink on the shell of each imported egg in letters not less than two millimetres in height . " <P> Up to last week over 12,000 " egg packers " ( wholesalers ) had registered with the Daily Mail a pledge to deal only in " Empire Eggs . " As the newspaper of world 's largest circulation ( 2,000,000 ) the Mail lavishly placed in the window of every shopkeeper whose " egg packer " had signed the pledge the following placard : Not to be outdone , the Cornish growers of broccoli , succulent vegetable , adopted last week a " National Mark " for their produce bearing a map of England exactly like that on the Daily Mail egg placards . For export to France the broccoli is labeled Choux-Fleurs , Premire Qualit , while Germans will receive Blumenkohl , Prima Qualitt . <P> At London 's aristocratic Savoy Hotel the Egg Song was played several times , last week , " by special request " ; and in common music halls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number with " Eggs ! Eggs ! Eggs ! "
