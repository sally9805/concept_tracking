txt In approving today the acquisition by the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company of the New Orleans . Texas &; Mexico Railway Company , which recently took over the , International - Great Northern lines , the Interstate Commerce ' Commission sharply criticized the interests involved for agreeing to pay bankers ' fees in excess of $1,000,000 to W. A. Harriman &; to .. Blair &; Co. and Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , prominent New ' York banking houses . ? The commission figures the fees to be received by Kuhn . Loeb &; Co. as fiscal agent for the Missouri Pacific at $225 , - 000 , and Commissioner Eastman estimated the combined profit to W. A. Hartman &; Co- and Blair &; Co. at about 5000.000 . Under the terms of the agreement Kuhn . Loeb &; Co. is to receive a commission equal- to 114 per cent . of the face value of sinking fund notes that may be issued by the Missouri Pacific in acquiring the capital stock of the New Orleans Company . The other banking houses arc to receive $6 per share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri Pacific from stockholders , the purcha.se price to be pegged at $114 per share and the Missouri Pacific agreeing to pay $120 per share to the bankers . The majority membership of the commission which approved the application for the merger made the statement that there were certain aspects of the method by which it was proposed that the applicant should acquire the stock in question which were " so unfortunate as to cause hesitancy in giving approval " to the deal . Commissioners Eastman , and Campbell . on the other hand , refused to give nett : approval to the consolidation , Air . Campbell declaring that he could not sanction " a transaction which is to be consummated by wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars belonging to security holders , which , if it is to be recovered , at all , will have to be recovered at the expense of the shipping public . " Merger Covers 12,000 Miles . The proposed consolidation is - one of the largest that has been passed upon recently by the Interstate Commerce Commission and involves about 12,000 miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of the Gulf Coast . lines and the InternationalGreat Northern system . The commission pointed out that the applicant 's proposed system would provide the shortest route from Brownsville , Houston and Galveston , Texas , to St. Louis , Chicago and various pastern points , and would help to open up a great producing country . Because of this , and in spite of the financial transactions commented upon , the commission declared that it feels that the best interests would be served by approving the merger . In making its application to take over the New Orleans , Texas &.Mexico; Railway , Cbmparky. the Missouri Pacific asked for authority to issue not exceeding $18,000,000 of Missouri Pacific Railroad Company fifteen-year 7 per cent . sinking fund notes .. with New Orleans . Texas &; Mexico Railway Company stock as collateral . This request was granted . After describing the railroad properties involved in the merger , the majority of the commission takes up the financial features to which it finds objection . The , principal details in the financing program are given as follows : " Under an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased from W. A. Harriman &; Co .. Inc. , and Blair &; Co .. Inc. , 37.500 shares of the capital stock of the New Orleans Ciompany out of a total issue of 150,000 shares , at $120 a share . In consideration of such purchase the applicant obtained an option , expiring not later than Jan. 15. 1925 , to purchase from these banking companies 39.000 additional shares of the New Orleans company , and has agreed , in the event if shall exercise such option , to purchase all other capital stock of the New Orleans company acquired by the banking companies and tendered to it within ninety days after the exercise of the option . It would appear from the agreement between the applicant and the banking companies that the applicant is limited , during the ninety-day period , to the purchase of stock of the New Orleans company from the banking cornpanics . To Buy Additional Stock . " Authority is sought to acquire control of the New Orleans Company through the purchase of stock additional to the 37.500 shares heretofore acquired . The price to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On this basis the cost of the entire authorized capital stock would ' be $18.000.000 . It is . . claimed that the book value of the stock is $151 a share . We hate not completed our valuation of the properties . " For the purpose of acquiring shares of the capital stock of the New Orleans Company held by other persons , the banking companies have entered , or will enter . into agreements with stockholders under which the banking companies agree to purchase certain shares of the stock and are given the option , until Jan. 15 , 1025 , to purchase additional shares at the price of $114 a share , or , as stated in the aforesaid agreements , $120 a share , less 5 per cent . profit to the purchasers , payment in each instance to be in securities of the applicant received by the banking companies . ? " There are other agreements , which are ' optional with stockholder as to signing . ' the purpose of which is to give to the banking companies the option of purchasing all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be received by the stockholders in payment for the stock sold to the banking companies . In these last named agreements* the price fixed for the fifteen-month secured notes is 971 ; 2 and accrued interest , and the price fixed for the proposed fifteen-year sinking fund notes is 94 and accrued interest . " For services in connection with the negotiations resulting in the agreement of May 1 , 1924. the applicant agreed to pay Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. a sum equal to Psi per cent . of tie face value of the securities that it may issue in- acquiring capital stock of the New Orleans Company . Upon the basis of the issue of siS.000.000 of proposed fifteen-year sinning fund notes , for all of the capital stock of the New Orleans Company ? namely , 150.000 shares  --  the agreed payment would amount to $223,000 . It does not appear that the payment will be made by the applicant out of the proceeds of the securities issued . " The majority of the commission gives in some detail preliminary steps which have been taken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already had acquired 37.500 shares of the capital stock of the New Orleans Company in obtaining an option on the shares which would be necessary to gain a , controlling interest . The Missouri Pacific must obtain at least 39,000 shares more , as there are 150.000 shares outstanding . The option on these shares given to the Missouri Pacific by the banking concerns will export on Jan. 23 , 1923 . The Missouri Pacific also agrees to take over all of the shares offered to it within ninety days after the option is exercised . Financial Transactions Criticized . Concerning the financial transactions involved in the proposed merger the commission says : " There are certain aspects of the method by Which it is proposed that the applicant shall acquire the stock in question which are so unfortunate as to cause hesitancy In giving approval to the acquisition of the stock involved on the terms proposed . Our approval of the application is in spite of those aspects . To deny approval because of objectionable features which - seemingly can not be eliminated would prevent the applicant from acquiring the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expenses incident to its purchase , makes the acquisition of advantage to the applicant . " It is evident that in one way or another the bankers who , on one hand , on behalf of the stockholders , render services to bring about a sale to the applicant in the interest of the stockholders. and , on the other hand , render services to the applicant in order - to induce the owners of such stock to snake the sale , are to receive compensation or profit on the transaction in an amount apparently in , excess of $1.000,000 . ? " It has been represented to us that the stockholders desire to sell and the applicant desires to purchase . The warrant under such circumstances for the interposition of the activity of bankers at the vast expense mentioned to the parties served is not clear . The applicant having determined that it is wise for it to purchase the stock in question . and that it is willing to pay therefor $120 per share . it has the right , if and when authorized by us , to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it acts in good faith and resorts to no improper means . A willingness on the part of the applicant to pay to the stockholders $114 per share , which was substantially above the niarket , shields the applicant from any charge of seeking tosacquire the stock for less than its fair value . " Under these circumstances the applicant is entitled to adopt such procedure in making the purchase as would not enhance its market price and make It difficult or impossible to procure the stock . In its own interest it was entitled to limit its payment to stockholders at $114 per share . In order to bring about sales at that price , it was proper for the applicant to stay out of the market and employ the services of others to acquire the stock , and to pay proper compensation for such services . Calls Payment Exeesslre . " It . would appear that to pay $6 per share for such services , plus $225.000 in connection with the transaction to its own bankers ; was excessive compensation for such services . Nor . regarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for the applicant to agree that it would not purchase except through the bankers . " This provision suggests acquiescence by the applicant in an endeavor by the bankers who receive the $6 per share to force payment to them by the stockholders , in order that the stockholders might have the benefit of a sale at $114 per share rather than at the market price . It is to be noted that two of the banking firms which receive the compensation of $6 per share acted not for the applicant but for the stockholders , or in their own behalf as dealers . " It has been urged upon us that the bankers were entitled to such suni be ! cause of the value to the stockholders of their services rendered over a period of years , culminating in their successful sale of the stock . The fact that the bankers believe themselves to be entitled to this compensation from the stockholders is their apparent reason for giving the transaction such form as practically to compel the stockholders to pay that compensation . . " As already noted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other firm of bankers is that it was justified in order to induce the representatives of the stockholders to make ' the sale . Whatever may be said of the right of the bankers to demand these large sums , it would appear that the applicant , in order to acquire the stock . was required to pay them . Under these circumstances , and because in any event the purchase by the applicant at a price not exceeding $120 per share appears to be warranted , we approve it . " We have no jurisdiction to determine the compensation which the bankers should receive , but deem it our duty to call attention to the aspects which we have mentioned . " Commissioner Eastman Dissents . Commissioner Eastman , one of the dissenters , questioned the authority of the commission to approve of a merger which might conflict with the plan for the consolidation of railroads which the commission is instructed to make under the Transportation act of 1920 , and took exception to the substitution of bonded debt for railroad stock . " Not content to rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastman , " the Missouri Pacific has sought the guidance and advice in this transaction of Kuhn , Loeb &; Co . For this guidance and advance it is to pay 114 per cent . I on the face value of such securities as may be issued in connection with the purchase of the Gulf Coast Lines stock . If - all the stock is acquired , the fee will amount to $225,000 . If justification for this fee , we are told in part : " ' It was necessary , first of all , to predispose W. A Harriman &; Co. ; Inc .. and Blair &; Co. , Inc. , to entertain the suggestion that they dispose of their holdings in a property in the future of which they had great faith . This having been accomplished , It was necessary to determine , first , a price for the stock . of the New Orleans , Texas &; Mexico which would be satisfactory to the Missouri Pacific and to W. A. Harriman &; Co. , Inc. , and Blair &; Co. , Inc .. and which probably would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Texas &; Mexico . ' " The stock was , or is to be , purchased through W. A. Harriman &; Co , . Inc. , and Blair &; Co. , Inc . Some of it these concerns already held , but most of it they obtained or are to obtainefrom other stockholders at $114 per share . Sale to the Missouri Pacific is at $120 per share . If the latter acquires all the stock under the plan contemplated , the profit to W. A. Harriman &; Co . Inc. , and Blair &; Co. , Inc. , will'be $900,000 , assuming no greater profit than $6 per - share on the stock which they already held. - ' " Apparently further options were contemplated , under which the stockholders who sold to these bankers at $114 per share were also to agree-to sell to the bankers at94 the fifteen-year notes of the Missouri Pacific received in payment for the stock . Inasmuch as these notes will certainly be worth par , and probably more , this would .. have involved a still greater profit to ' the bankers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , abandoned . Cites Justification for Bankers ' Profit . " In justification for the profit to these bankers we are told , in part : " ' That the price of $114 per share for the stock of the New . Orleans , Texas &; Mexico ( this excluding a substantial- divs Wend which went to the stockholders ) represented an advance to the stockholders of about 500 per cent . since 1916 prices . and would have been impossible . as deponent believes , to obtain for the stockholders without the prior commitment of W. A. Harriman &; Co. , Inc .. and Blair Co. , Inc. , to the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company . ' " The facts speak for themselves . It should further be noted that , while the ostensible price paid by the Missouri Pacific is $120 per share , an essential part of the deal is the special cash dividend of per cent . paid to the sell ; ng stockholders . The bankers at first insisted upon ' a price of $135 per share , but finally agreed to change the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking $120 per share plus the special dividend . This is equivalefit to $130.50 per share . The market price upon the day of the final argument in this proceeding was $109 . " Kuhn . Loeb &; Co. are the regular fiscal agents of the Missouri Pacific . When that railroad issues securities they are sold to the public through Kuhn . Loeb &; Co. and its connections as a matter of rourre . One of the defenses offered for this variety of monopoly , which is widely prevalent in the railroad world , is that by such arrangement a railroad enlists the friendly interest and assistance of an experienced firm of bankers . In this case . it does not appear that the Missouri Pacific secures such friendly interest and advice at anything less than the current market price . " 1 am authorized to say that Commissioner alcManamy concurs in this dissent . " Campbell Points Out Waste . ' Commissioner Campbell , in. dissenting , said in part : " The Congress has not given us power to say to applicants under Paragraph ( 2 ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid to bankers for handling a transaction such as this , but It is our duty to see to it that the transactio nis in the public interest , and that means the interest of the applicant 's security holders as well as of the shippers who would be benefited by the transaction . 1 can not give my sanction to a transaction which is to be consummated by wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars belonging to security holders , which , If it is to be recovered at all , will have to be recovered at the expense of the shipping public . " Tells of " Extra Dividend . The extra dividend to which Commissioner Eastman refers is mentioned by the majority of the ' commission as follows : " It is further provided by the agreement of May 1 , 1924. that , prior to the acquisition by the applicant of the 39,000 shares of stock in pursuance of the option contained in that agreement , the directors of the - New Orleans Company might declare , in addition to current dividends at the rate of 7 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 161/2 per cent . upon the outstanding stock . Such an extra dividend , amounting to $2.44. , 423.50 , was declared on May 19 , 1924 , payable in instalments on June 2 , Sept. 1 and-Dec/1 , 1924 . " The commission states that petitions in opposition to the application were filed by the Louisiana Public Service Commission and by B. P. Yoakum , but no appearance was made . The Attorney General of Texas also filed objection . contending that the merger would violate the State laws and State Constitution if parallel and competing , lines were joined in a consolidation . The commission-held that the proposed acquisition was in accord with its tentative plan for the consolidation of railroads , as the lines of the Missouri Pacific , the New Orleans Company and its subsidiaries and the International Company are Included in System 19 , as proposed in the tentative plan . NO CONSOLIDATION YET . But Missouri . Pacific Gets Control of $1,000,000,000 Rail ' System . William H. Williams . Chairman of the Board of Directors of ' the Missouri Pacific , yesterday became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically $1,000,000,000 and a total of more than 14.000- miles of track through - the Interstate Commerce Coinmission 's consent to the Missouri Pacific acquiring control of the Texas es- Pacific , the International Great Northern and the New Orleans , Texas &; Mexico , and will have one-half interest in . the control of the Denver &; Rio Grande Western ' Railroad . Plans have not been completed for a consolidation . This may come later , Init the officials who gathered the great system together are content for the present to operate the property with the smaller lines as s subsidiaries to the Missouri Pacific coin -- pang . Among the , other systems included in the Missouri ' Pacific grouping are the Chicago &; Eastern Illinois , the - Kansas City Southern . and the Louisiana &; Arkansas Railway .. When asked yesterday . what ' the next step of the Missouri Pacific would be a representative of the company said : ' This is all for the present . What was will do in the future we can not say at this time . " Deals involving millions of dollars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various , roads into a single system . Reorganlia-* tion of the Texas &; Pacific accomplished last year resulted in control going tit the Missouri Pacific . Then the reorganization of- the Denver &; Rio Grande , . the final details of which remain to be accomplished . resulted in one-half control of that railroad going to the Missouri Pacific . The sale of the International Great Northern to the - New Orleans . Texas &; Mexico and the subsequent sale of ? the latter property to , the Missouri Pacific were other-steps which had to be accomplished before the plan was finally submitted ' to the . ' Interstate Cominerce Conunission for approval .
