Normally dogs snatch at food ; elephants reach out their trunks for it . A man will pull his hand away from a hot plate . These are examples of unconditioned reflexes , fully developed in infancy . They constitute the equipment with which the animal faces life , according to the behaviorists. * By modifying the conditions , the simple reflexes may be changed , becoming more complicated , or conditioned . The process of changing an unconditioned reflex into a conditioned reflex was clearly demonstrated to an audience of psychiatrists at the Academy of Medicine last week , in a cinema entitled " The Mechanics of the Brain . " <P> The cinema showed dogs which dripped saliva at the sound of a bell , monkeys which marathoned to the food box at the sight of a red card , children who opened hungry mouths when their wrists were pressed . These are examples of conditioned reflexes and upon this conditioning is based the difference between the lower and the higher animals , including man . <P> The unconditioned reflex is the simplest nervous reaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nature believes in preparedness and the dog will secrete saliva as he goes for the food . Only the lower parts of the brain are concerned in this reaction . But , if a bell is rung every time the food appears , there will come a time when the dog will secrete saliva at the sound of the bell when there is no food in sight . <P> The simple reflex has been conditioned by the bell ; the dog has associated the food with the sound ; the power house of the upper brain has gone into action , and the intelligent animal now reacts to an idea . This is the learning mechanism in its elementary form . If the upper brain is now removed , the learned reaction will be lost . <P> Not only can animals be taught to associate widely different stimuli , but they can be taught to discriminate . Example : <P> Old Lady , wise ape , was presented repeatedly and alternately with a red card , and with a blue card . With the red card came , always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the food box but no food . After a while , the food box was removed to a distant corner . Red and blue cards kept flashing before Old Lady 's eyes . When the blue card flashed , Old Lady gazed at it in polite boredom and went on quietly with her toilet . They could n't fool her . But when the blue card disappeared and the red card showed , Old Lady 's eyes gleamed . She swung herself from her perch , rushed down the ladder with unladylike haste and made for the food box in the corner . <P> Here is the rejection of one idea and the acceptance of another ; a more complicated instance of learning . <P> The evolution of the animal depends on the development of the upper brain : the greater the development the more complicated the conditioned reflexes become . The ability to learn by experience , which is simply a matter of conditioning the reflexes , increases ; the animal can adjust to ever more varied environments . Man has the most intricately convoluted upper brain of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide range of conditions .
