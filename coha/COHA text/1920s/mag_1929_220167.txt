No hurly-burly like that of the University of Missouri , ( see above ) , but a sepulchral silence , fell last week upon the campus of the University of Detroit . By order of the President ( Dr. John Patrick McNichols ) , the 300 girl students were forbidden to converse with the 2,900 boy students . They might , if they wished , say " Good morning " or even ' ' How do you do , ' ' but nothing more . <P> Explained Dean of Women Florence Donahue : " Father McNichols said the girls could do their love-making off the campus . They came here to study . He is tired of seeing the girls act like campus widows . It would not have been so bad if they talked to only one boy at a time , but when they stopped to talk to one they were soon chatting with seven or eight . " <P> Said an indignant coed : " The men are to blame . They stop us and start to talk to us. "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
