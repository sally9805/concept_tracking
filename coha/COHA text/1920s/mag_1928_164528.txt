SAM HOUSTON , COLOSSUS IN BUCKSKIN-George Creel-Cosmopolitan ( $3 ) . The annexation of Texas was so much a matter of politics that the real issues , violent and blood-spattered , are dimmed . George Creel* brings them to light through the colorful story of Sam Houston , dreamer , drunkard , man of action . A youth , in Tennessee , he showed dangerous scholastic tendencies , poring over Pope 's Iliad , so his brothers set him clerking in the village store . Seeking refuge with the Cherokees , Sam announced in grandiloquent terms worthy of his master , Pope , that he preferred measuring deer tracks to tape ; and later married a squaw as majestic as himself ( 6 ft. 6 in . ) <P> From such lowly origin he rose through military apprenticeship under Andrew Jackson , six months ' law study and admission to the bar , governorship of Texas , championship of the Indians , and national notoriety gained by a brawl with a Senator , to generalship of the Texan army , 800 strong . For Texas had at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bitterly criticized for procrastination , Houston saw no reason for having two bites at one cherry , and proved his strategy by routing General Santa Anna , whose army outnumbered the Texans two to one . <P> Followed the wrangling and financial difficulties of a young republic , but Houston proved himself as excellent an administrator as general , dealt firmly with domestic problems , juggled adroitly the jealous rivalries of England , France , and the U. S. <P> The story of " Old San Jacinto " and his friends-Old Hickory , Austin , Bowie ( of the knife ) - is inherently so dramatic that his present biographer 's insistence upon long documentary quotations only retards the action . Equitable , Author Creel prints interesting letters and records defaming his hero , but precedes them with such convincing evidence of Sam Houston 's bravery and devoted patriotism , that one recognizes in the abuse merely the jealousies that accumulate around any dynamic personality . <P> <P> * Chairman of the Committee of Public Information ( i. e. " censor " ) , by appointment of President Wilson ( 1917-19 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
