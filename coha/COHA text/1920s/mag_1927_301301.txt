Eight schoolboys from Kent , Conn . ( TIME , Feb. 28 ) , beginning their invasion of England , were pitted against eight veterans of the Thames Rowing Club , in the first heat of the Grand Challenge Cup Race of the Royal Henley Regatta on the Thames last week . It was a magnificent duel . Kent had the weight advantage and youth . The Thames Club had years of experience . Stroke for stroke , the two shells raced over three-quarters of the course . Then Kent nosed ahead . Jack Beresford quickly raised the stroke in the Thames Club boat . By a quarter of a length , the Thames Club won that race ; later , by wider margins , it captured the Grand Challenge Cup . <P> Not downhearted , the Kent boys prepared for invitation battles with Eton and Radley.
