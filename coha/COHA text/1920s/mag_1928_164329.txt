There are three Robinsons-Joseph Taylor Robinson , senior Senator from Arkansas , Democratic leader ; Theodore Douglas Robinson , nephew of the late Theodore Roosevelt , Assistant Secretary of the Navy ; and Arthur R. Robinson , whom discredited Governor Jackson of Indiana chose out of his Klannish entourage in 1925 to fill out the term of the late Samuel M. Ralston as Indiana 's junior Senator . <P> Of these three , the last and least , Indiana 's Robinson , has participated most obscurely in governing the U. S. , until last fortnight . Then , thinking he saw a chance to drag the Democratic Party into the Oil Scandal , he stood up in the Senate and falsely imputed a relation with Oilman Sinclair to Governor Smith of New York . " Birds of a feather ! " he jibed . Democrats soon stuffed Indiana 's own jailbirds and Klan feathers down Senator Robinson 's throat ( TIME , April 2 ) . <P> Last week he tried again , this time remarking , with carefully prepared smirks and innuendos , that members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doheny after leaving office ; that Senator Walsh had praised Oilman Doheny when the latter gave advice on the legislation that made the Oil Scandal possible . <P> " The ' conspiracy ' was formed , " said Senator Robinson , " not at the Chicago convention in 1920 but in Washington , during the Wilson Administration , participated in by high officials of that administration and aided and abetted by still other Democrats of high standing . " Senator Robinson pictured the late Franklin K. Lane , onetime ( 1913-20 ) Secretary of the Interior , as " the originator of the proposal to lease naval oil lands to private interests to be exploited by them . " <P> Virginia 's hard-working little Carter Glass , now in the Senate , was one of the late Mr. Lane 's closest friends and served with him in the Wilson Cabinet . Now , at Senator Robinson 's remark , Senator Glass sprang up , storming : " Does the Senator mean to suggest that Franklin K. Lane ever accepted a bribe from Mr. Doheny ? If he does then I denounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Robinson : " I do not mean to reflect on Franklin K. Lane . " <P> Glass : " Yes , that is exactly what the Senator means and the denial simply accentuates his moral turpitude in doing it . " <P> Robinson : " ... I think Franklin K. Lane bore a very high reputation . . . but Senators on the other side of the Chamber have not hesitated to go down into the tomb for Republicans who have passed away . . . . Democrats attempt to smear oil all over dead Republicans . But if we merely mention a man who perchance happens to be a Democrat , then something is wrong . . . . " <P> Glass : " The question here is , what does the Senator mean by accusing Franklin K. Lane ? " <P> Robinson : " I am not charging him with bribery . " <P> Glass : " The Senator is not doing it outright . He is doing it by the meanest kind of insinuation . " <P> Robinson : " In my judgment , it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out and accept oil employment immediately after leaving the Cabinet . " <P> Glass : " My judgment is that there is no kind of cowardice on this earth that is worse than an insinuation against an honest man who because he is dead , can not defend his own character . "
