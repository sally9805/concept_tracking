DID MAYOR THOMPSON ask King George 's permis- sion to run for Mayor of Chicago ? Did a French presidential candidate ever go to Berlin to see if he was regarded with favor ? And how would American editors comment if Mr. Cosgrave publicly went to London for advice and approval before conducting a campaign in Ireland ? They would hoot at him . And they should hoot at the present spectacle in Nicaragua and Washington . General McCoy is on the spot , preparing for an " honest election , " with United States Marines supervising the free expression of Nicaraguan opinion all the way from registration to vote-casting . Ex-President Chamorro has done the natural thing under the - circumstances . He has gone to Washington frankly to " seek permission to run for President of Nicaragua . " The New York Herald-Tribune 's Washington bureau reports cryptically that This government is not going to say that any man shall not run for the Presidency in Nicaragua . However , it will not recognize any man elected who is unable to qualify under the Nicaraguan constitution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is alleged by the State Depar Lment he is ineligible for President under the Nicaraguan constitution . When one recalls what the Marines did to the last man whom Washington refused to recognize the cryptic report loses its obscurity . We will not say that any man shall not run for the Presidency , but if a man we do not like is elected we will not " recognize " him  --  we will merely disarm his soldiers , seize and dump his arms into the river , and declare " neutral zones " wherever opposition troops are in danger of attack . Will Rogers only mildly exaggerates when he says " if necessary the marines would do a little voting on the side to_the emselves . " ' W HAT IS NEWS ? It 's an old question and there are many answers . We offer this sample of the foreign correspondence of the Associated Press , culled from its setting , between the fight films and a bomb plot , on the front page of the New York World : - In the white uniform of a nurse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " slim gray Princess , " as the Rumanians call her , makes a striking figure of beauty , benevolence , and benignity , her beautiful bobbed blond hair growing in such profusion that it covers even her sad , blue eyes and her deep dimples. - - D READFUL NEWS comes out of New York . One hundred per cent Americanism and the bolshevik menace are a drug on the market . Please do n't take our word for it , for we have high authority for this calamitous state of affairs . It-was Mrs. George E. Owens , the president of the Government Club in New York who rose and said to the members of her club : " This year you wo n't hear anything about the red menace . It is a horrible commentary , but women seem to be fed up with patriotism and bored by talk of our nation 's security . This year we are going to stress - municipal government . " And so this loyal and devoted club , which since its foundation has been devoting all its precious energies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immigration which is " ruining " America , and the inculcation of aggressive Americanism in the public schools had to step down from this noble pedestal , and was compelled to spend an afternoon listening to the Commissioner of Parks of New York City denounce the Americans who scatter newspapers and trash all over the public parks . But their fall in the scale of true Americanism did not stop there . They actually let a full-fledged general come before them and advance the bolshevik idea that there should be no further amendments to the Constitution unless they are submitted in advance to all the people to be voted on in a nation-wide referendum . Only one thing revived our drooping spirits as we read of this happening . Mrs. Owens saved the day by denouncing the nation-wide efforts to save Sacco and Vanzetti , and demanded that " when citizens of the United States try to intimidate governors , judges , and juries , they should forfeit their citizenship . " Fortunate the republic that has a Mrs. Owens still on guard ! OUVAIN 'S LIBRARY is being restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ; Americans have been - largely instrumental in rebuilding it . Yet because Cardinal Mercier , now dead and unable to speak for him-self , agreed , during the stress of after-war emotion , to a certain inscription over the new building , Whitney Warren , the architect , refuses to have the inscription changed , even at the suggestion of the president of the Carnegie Foundation for International Peace , Nicholas Murray Butler . The inscription now reads : " Destroyed by Teutonic Fury ; Restored by American Generosity . " The bad taste of the second half of the sentence is hardly debatable  --  it is typically " American " to take all the credit for what may not be solely due to American efforts ; and of the unwisdom of the first phrase there can be no question . Dr. Butler suggests the obvious emendation : " Destroyed by War . " Destroyed by war  --  that it was . In war men do not think of rare books , of fine libraries , of priceless cathedr1 glass , any more than they consider human life . War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace . A FTER STRIKES lasting since April 1 the miners in the bituminous coal-fields of Illinois and Iowa have won . Just what they have won is not so certain . The truce which was recently signed grants to the 72,000 miners in Illinois and the 9,000 in Iowa the same old wage scale . This is to last until February 7 . In the meantime it is hoped that a joint commission will have discovered some plan that will be acceptable to both sides . But if it does not , then what ? If a suitable plan is not drafted by February 7 , the coal miners will again face the choice between a six-months ' strike or starvation wages . They will again have visions of the destitution that has prevailed in Illinois for months . Furthermore , it should be remembered that the miners in Ohio and Pennsylvania are still on strike and facing daily worse conditions . As long as the miners are forced to make separate truces like the ones in Iowa and Illinois they will be faced with the possibility , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local solution . The chaos that has prevailed in the bituminous coal industry throughout the summer , which still exists in Ohio and Pennsylvania , is ample evidence that something far more thoroughgoing than these simple truces is required . A CENTURY OF SANCTUARY in the United States having been rudely broken by the World War , the nonresistant sect of Mennonites has been compelled to seek refuge elsewhere . In Paraguay they have found their new paradise , and more than a hundred thousand are expected to migrate there within the next few years . The Paraguayan Government has been generous in its protection of and concessions to these new citizens . A charter has been granted the Mennonites which provides , among other things , for complete and perpetual immunity from military duty and exemption from participation in a war , even as non-combatants ; the Mennonites are also to be relieved from the obligation of taking an oath ; they are to be permitted their own churches and schools conducted in their own language ? German ; they are to be exempted from all national and municipal taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government of Paraguay is making a gesture of welcome , without any strings to it . In this year of grace , with echoes of war persecution still ringing in our ears , with the unheeded protests of religious objectors to military service still fresh in our memories , the action of Paraguay stands out . A description of the three-million-acre tract to be taken up by the Mennonites reads like paradise indeed : There are endless opportunities awaiting the skillful and industrious man . . . . Riches lie dormant awaiting men of energy . thrift , and skill to turn the immense , wild , uncultivated prairies and meadows into a paradise . There are all resources for the creation of wealth , coupled with the most wonderful climate which can be found anywhere on the globe . Which , except for the extravagance about the climate , might have been written of our own Mississippi Valley a century ago . In those days we , too , had not yet learned that every man who has scruples against killing in war must be a lying blackguard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrowing the Government of the United States . W E CHARGED GOVERNOR FULLER of Massachu- setts , in our issue of August 17 , with having demonstrated his inability to rise above class and political prejudice as early as the red hysteria of 1919 . He was then a member of Congress from Massachusetts , and in the debates over the expulsion of Representative Victor Berger he violently attacked " the red scum of Europe , " " the wolves of anarchy , " " the enemies within , " and " the whole brood of anarchists , bolsheviks , I.W.W.s. , and revolutionaries . " We stated that he had called for the " execution of the whole scum and brood . " This was a misquotation , and we owe Governor Fuller an apology for it . We based our statement on an apparent quotation from his speech reported in the New York Evening World of August 8 . The World , in condensing a statement sent out from the Socialist Party headquarters , made a confusion of terms and substituted the word " execution " for " crucifixion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded " the crucifixion of disloyalty , the nailing of sedition to the cross of free government , where the whole brood of anarchists , bolsheviks , I.W.W.s. and revolutionaries may see and raari a anl crn-n warning , " and the context shows that by " crucifixion " he meant such action as the expulsion of Berger . But the whole speech proves his complete lack of judicial quality . T HE UNITED STATES is the workers ' paradise , accord- ing to figures taken from the Monthly Labor Review of the Department of Labor . That is to say , skilled union labor in this country receives wages that would make most European workers in a corresponding job faint with surprise . In New York City for an eight-hour day in the current year bricklayers receive $14 , carpenters $12 , painters $14 , plasterers $14 , plumbers $12 , and the humble and once derided hod-carrier $9 . Compare these figures , which are by no means an indication that workers in these respective occupations are rolling in wealth , with figures in other parts of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason to suppose that since that time wages have been greatly increased  --  workers in building and allied industries received for an eight-hour-day approximately $2.40 . Bricklayers in Brazil in 1927 receive a daily wage of from $1.53 to $2.36 ; carpenters in Japan in October , 1926 , were paid $.91 daily , plasterers $1.42 , bricklayers $1.63 , and painters $1.69 ; for an eight-hour day in Latvia carpenters now receive $.86 , masons $1.11 , and skilled building-workers an average of $1.08 ; in Warsaw masons are paid $.99 for an eight-hour day and carpenters $.96 . It is plain to one who knows America that carpenters ' wages here are not twelve times as large in purchasing value as wages in Poland , but it would be difficult to make a Polish carpenter believe it . And allowing for the difference in price levels , the American standard of living is so much higher as to justify envy among workers in other countries . WHEN THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANU-FACTURERS starts gunning against child labor the battle is half won . That stalwart band of hard-boiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child-labor amendment to the federal Constitution , have now come out with a " program for the further protection of employed children fourteen and fifteen years of age . " This amazing and encouraging document demands a medical examination of working children , a minimum sixth-grade educational requirement , provision for continuation schools , a 48-hour week , and no work after 9 p. m . The National Child Labor Committee hails the program as " one of the most important events " in that field for many years . It would , of course , like more  --  it wants a specified eight-hour-day and six-day-week , an earlier closing hour , and an eighth-grade minimum . But it hails the program as evidence that public opinion against child labor has worked through into the citadels of industry . And it is ready to cooperate with the manufacturers in an aggressive campaign to realize their program . Only six States ( lllinois , Iowa , New York , Ohio , Oregon , and Wisconsin ) now have legislation measuring up to the manufacturer 's standdards . Seventeen do not require physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not require the completion of the sixth grade ; 21 have no continuation-school law ; 13 permit more than a 48-hour week for factory children between 14 and 16 years ; while 32 States permit children to work in factories before seven in the morning and 5 after nine o'clock at night . What will the manufacturers do to realize their program ? T HAT A GOOD JUDGE ought to be reelected regardless of his party is accepted today in both major political camps of New York City , and the fact is another evidence that political progress is not impossible . But recently a new limitation has been set on this principle  --  the Democrats and Republicans are fighting to defeat Judge Jacob Pancken for reelection as Judge of the Municipal Court . He is a Socialist , elected in 1917 , and it seems that the party truce does not apply to Socialists  --  although at one time the Republicans , weak in his district , talked of making him their candidate in order to defeat the Democrats . " The poor man 's court " does not often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the easily-awarded political plums . But Judge Pancken has given it distinction . He has cleared his courtroom . of " steerers " and other parasites ; he has talked to witnesses in their own foreign languages and made them feel at home ; he has adjourned court , again and again in order to inspect tenant-homes in rent cases which came before him . Despite his avowed sympathy for the underdog , he has won such a reputation for fairness - that landlords have suggested his name as arbiter in difficult cases . The municipal courts need such men , and party- considerations ought to play no part in choosing them . That a group of nonpartisan lawyers is supporting him is encouraging . NO MORE IMPORTANT ART EVENT can occur here this winter than the return after twenty-eight years of Jacob Epstein , the sculptor , to America his native coun-try , and the exhibition of some fifty of his works in New York and , we hope , other cities . Mr. Epstein is another of those products of free immigration , which , as every patrioteer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation and to our standing in the world . For a quarter of a century he has been living in London and hypnotizing the English art world into declaring him to be , as the Manchester Guardian puts it , an " artist of deep and curious genius . " Under the spell of that belief his work has been purchased not only for the British national collection , for the Tate Gallery and the Manchester , Glasgow , Dundee , and other municipal collections , but he has been commissioned to make portrait busts of Joseph Conrad , Admiral " Jack " Fisher , Ramsay MacDonald , C. P. Scott , the Duchess of Hamilton , Lady Gregory , and other , distinguished persons . True , there- have been discordant voices , as when his memorial to W. H. Hudson was erected in Hyde park  --  good , old-fashioned , British protests against anything so unconventional and original . Now he is back on the spot where his Russian-Polish parents landed from the Old World . So far America has let him see by its indifference that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior attitude will be maintained or whether America can be induced to- forego its prejudices long enough to follow British example and honor a man who as much as any other living has convinced England that art did not die with the last century . T HE ACTION OF JUDGE KNOX in refusing to hear " experts " testify to the literary value of John Herrmann 's novel " What Happens , " 300 copies of which , coming from France some months ago , had been seized by the customs authorities as obscene matter , in a sense does not disturb us . We heartily wish that the book were allowed to circulate , as now it is not to be , but we do not recognize- " experts " in such cases . We look to the time when any book whatever may be allowed to find its audience without interference from the courts . Meanwhile we should like to spare such citizens as Messrs . Broun , Mencken , and Hansen the embarrassment of having to stand before a jury and speak as if their personal judgment were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another sense , however , the refusal of a judge to hear an author 's contemporaries attest the value of his work is highly regrettable at this stage of the war against censorship . The courts have a ruling that the classics are admissible , however obscene , because the verdict of the ages is in their favor . But how is a living writer to prove that his books are admissible if his own age first of all does not have a chance to approve or disapprove ? The law here is - not only unfair but foolish , and we hope that counsel - for Mr. Herrmann and those who come after him will be able to make this clear . rr iw HE RIGHT OF BOOKS to be read by high-school J. seniors is being decided in Grand Rapids , Michigan , by parents and officials . Albert Marckwardt , teacher in a Grand Rapids high school , asked his class in English to review George Jean Nathan 's " Land of the Pilgrim 's Pride . " The mother of one of the girls saw the book at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Marckwardt 's disappearance from the Grand Rapids school system . The offending section of Mr. Nathan 's book dealt with the thing - once celebrated by The Nation as " Our Changing Morality " ? a thing upon which Mr. Nathan , ironically enough , has Tory views , though he speaks plainly in expressing them . For that matter , many of the students may have had Tory views which their parents would be happy to hear . In the interests of " morality " these , it appears , are not to be expressed at all .
