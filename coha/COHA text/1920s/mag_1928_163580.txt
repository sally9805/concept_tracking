FREMONT-THE WEST 'S GREATEST ADVENTURER-Allan Nevins-Harpers ( two vols. $10 ) . <P> The Man . He might have been U. S. President during the Civil War , or built a fortune as big as the Rockefellers ' or outshone Sam Houston , Dewey and Lindbergh as heroes . But ask the man-on-the-street today who John Charles Frmont was , and the answer will probably be : " The name sounds familiar , but I ca n't quite place him . " <P> Thus almost lost to fame is the most exciting and excitable figure that ever trod the soil of North America . Frmont was , characteristically enough , born unconventionally in 1813 . His mother was the wife of gouty Major John Pryor , but his father was a dashing French emigr ( Charles Frmon ) who ran off with his mother . Reared in the best Charleston , S. C. , society , Frmont was a quick Latin and Greek scholar . People thought he might make a teacher or a preacher , until Joel R. Poinsett ( manifest destiny man , Secretary of War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Army Topographical Corps . He explored in the upper Mississippi and Missouri Rivers , returned to Washington , D. C. , with a reputation , was also pointed out as " the handsomest young man who ever walked the streets . " He wooed and quickly won Jessie , 16-year-old daughter of irascible Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri . But the Senator objected to their marriage , so Frmont surveyed in Iowa before eloping with Jessie . Vexed though the Senator was , he forgave and made Frmont his willing tool to open up the vast West . The young couple were presented to President Tyler in " the greatest crush in the White House since President Jackson had exhibited Colonel Meacham 's gigantic cheese . " <P> In 1842 , Frmont went West with famed Kit Carson , observed buffalo , ate dog meat , charted the Continental Divide . Returning to Washington where Jessie lay in childbirth , he spread over her bed a ragged flag , said : " This flag was raised over the highest peak of the Rocky Mountains . I have brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid , he wrote a report of his trip which exploded the myth that the " Great American Desert " lay between Missouri and the Rockies . The public read the document avidly ; the movement westward was stimulated . <P> On another expedition Frmont saw the Oregon Trail as busy as a barnyard in mating season , crossed the snow-deep Sierras in midwinter , visited Captain Suiter 's fort in the fertile Sacramento valley . Ideas of manifest destiny were firmly planted in Frmont 's head . So , on his next trip to California , he began to write history instead of geography . Mexican General Castro ordered him out of California . He went up to Oregon and waited for an excuse to raise the U. S. flag over California . An Indian attack gave it to him . Quickly he assembled U. S. settlers , made Suiter 's fort his base , marched the length of California , put an end to Mexican domination , was made provisional governor and com-mander-in-chief of California . He paused only long enough to name San Francisco harbor the Golden Gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico and a General Kearney arrived in California to take charge . Kearney and Frmont quarreled so violently that a lieutenant named William Tecumseh Sherman wondered : " Who the devil is the governor of California ? "
