MR ARNOLD BENNETT , in a recent criticism of our younger . novelists , attacked them on the ground that they all were without the power of creating characters , which , he said , was the foundation of good fiction , and nothing else . Thereupon Mrs Woolf took up the cudgels , and most cogently retorted by remarking that it was precisely in the generation of Mr Bennett himself and his contemporaries , Mr Wells and Mr Galsworthy , that character , and the power of creating it , disappeared from English literature . Mr Beresford then joined in the hunt ; and the spectacle of Mr Arnold Bennett , Mrs Virginia Woolf , and Mr J. D. Beresford tumbling over each other in full cry after this illusive hare , is one of such fascination , that even the most grizzly and retired of critical greyhounds must be irresistibly tempted to leap from his kennel and join the exhilarating chase . The essence of fiction , the sine qua non of novel-writing , is the game they are after : that is the creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in what covert the elusive puss is hidden , is among them a matter of lively dispute . I should like to suggest ( if I may join them ) that the field to which they confine themselves is rather too narrow . It is n't a question merely of English fiction ; or , in English fiction , of the Victorians , the Georgians , and our contemporary novelists . Indeed , to make sure that one has left no covert unexplored , one should include , I think , not only foreign novels , but the drama , and even the epic ; for these portray character as well as novels ; they are also , if I may permit myself the pun , " forms " in which our essential hare may be found lurking . If , then , we wish to arrive at some definite idea of what we mean by character-creation in fiction ; and , taking the word in its widest meaning , we summon up before our memories all the vast populations which people these worlds of the imagination , we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty definitely into two groups . By far the greater majority of them are stock figures , devoid of any independent existence . Personification of the  | passions , idealizations of abstract qualities , embodiments of simple forces , or types of various professions , these heroes and lovers and heroines and villains and lords and misers and millionaires and clergymen and lawyers , all have their names , their places in the social fabric ; they all are endowed , and sometimes over-endowed , with the characteristics of their sex ; they are upholstered in different kinds of clothes ; they are often described and analysed and dissected at enormous length ? and yet they almost all remain puppets : we see the strings that pull them ; and when the play or novel in which they figure is over , their life ceases , they are laid aside , and we think of them no more . But in the works of certain great writers , some of the figures ( though by no means all ) present a very different appearance . They seem to be framed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be real human beings , discoveries and not inventions ; they are no sooner brought into existence than they seem to have always existed : and when the novel is closed , or the curtain falls upon the drama , they go on living in our imaginations , and are as familiar to us as our relations , and our best-acquainted friends . These are the figures which we call " characters , " and the power of evoking them is what we call " character-creation . " It is a power possessed in the highest degree by Shakespeare ; we find it also in Scott , in Jane Austen , in Thackeray ; and Dickens possessed it almost to madness . It is commonly regarded as the greatest gift of these novelists , and the very essence of their art . And yet , curiously enough , none of our critics , with , as far as I know , only one exception , have attempted an analysis of this creative power , or at least any real discrimination between stock figures and these " created " characters . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eighteenth century , Maurice Morgann , who published in 1777 one small masterpiece of criticism , an Essay on the character of Falstaff , which is well known to Shakespeare scholars , and in which he deals with this question in a profoundly interesting way . What is the essential difference , he asks , between Shakespeare 's characters , and the stock figures of the other playwrights ' ? The answer he gives ? and I think it is essentially a true answer ? can be paraphrased in our modern vocabulary as follows . No personage can be put whole into a work of art ; the writer can only present the qualities and aspects which he needs  | for his purpose ; and in other playwrights the parts which are not seen , do not in fact exist ; their makers have told us all they know about them ; there is nothing more in these figures , as they conceive them , than what we see , and their hidden interiors are , as we may put it , filled , like dolls , with saw-dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they possess independence as well as relation ; they are living organisms , in which each part depends upon , and implies , the complete person . Although we see them in part only , yet from these glimpses we unconsciously infer the parts we do not see ; and when Shakespeare makes them act and speak , as he sometimes does , from their unportrayed but inferred aspects , he produces an astonishing effect of unforeseen , yet inevitable truth . Morgann does not discuss the means by which Shakespeare presents these characters to us , so as to make them seem real and living in our eyes . We have only however to look at one of his plays to perceive his method . He does not , of course , describe them ? that as a dramatist he could hardly do ? but he makes them , as it were , talk themselves into existence . The impression of individual character is produced by an individual way of speech ; each personage possesses an idiom , a diction , a rhythm , a sort of sing-song of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names , we can recognize each speaker by his voice . And when we look into it , we see that all our great character-creating novelists have adopted this Shakespearean method ; we find it in Scott , in Jane Austen , in Thackeray , and above all in Dickens , who created hundreds of living beings , endowing each with his own inner song , his excited or drowsy twitter , his personal " note , " as distinctive as the note of a wren or chaffinch . Dickens and the other Victorians no doubt abused this enchantment , this way of making their characters sing themselves into existence ; they reiterated their little tunes and catch-phrases so monotonously that their successors became disgusted with this method , and adopted the method of description and analysis instead . Is this perhaps the cause of that loss of charactercreating power which Mrs Woolf notes in them ? the reason why our novelists no longer people our imaginations with living forms ? Human nature nowadays , Mr Beresford suggests , is too complex , too self-conscious , too irresolute , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older writers . But does human  | nature change so rapidly ' ? Are many of us more complex , more self-conscious , more irresolute than Hamlet ' ? And yet has not Shakespeare created in Hamlet a most unmistakable and distinct and living being ? And , let us note , Hamlet is made real to us very largely by his speech-rhythms and intonations ? there is , for instance , as Mr Bradley has finely noted , nothing in the play more intensely characteristic , and more unmistakably individual , than Hamlet 's trick of verbal repetitions . " Words , words , words " ? " very like , very like " ? " thrift , thrift , Horatio "  --  " except my life , except my life , except my life " ? is not the very essence of Hamlet embodied in these little phrases ? Could any number of pages of analysis and description have made him more living to us ? If then this power of conceiving and creating and presenting character is found in the greatest of our playwrights and novelists , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ) ; if moreover we find it present in proportion to their greatness , and if its presence always gives enduring value to their works , is it not possible that we have found in this creative power the sine qua non , the quintessential quality of fiction ? Is our hunt over , our hare captured , and ready to be jugged and served up at last ? I do not think so ; the doctrine , which is now so fashionable , of the single , essential , all-sufficing ingredient , has always seemed to me too great a simplification of aesthetic problems . Even suppose we do find a sine qua non in art , a quality in the absence of which aesthetic value is always absent , how can we say that other qualities , non-aesthetic in themselves , do not acquire an intrinsic artvalue , when they combine with the essential quality in , as it were , a kind of chemical combination ? But however that may be , once we think of foreign literature , we will see that character-creation is not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hardly more an essential element in it than portraiture is an essential ingredient in the art of painting . To make hare-soup , one must , of course , first catch one 's hare ; but there are many other excellent kinds of soup brewed in the world 's kitchens . How many of these living and self-subsistent beings , like Hamlet , or Falstaff , or Pickwick , or Mr Micawber , do we find outside of English literature ? Hardly as many , I would almost venture to say , as in one play of Shakespeare , or one novel of Dickens or Jane Austen . It would be pleasant to sit down and read through the whole  | of European fiction to find if this is really so ; but not having leisure now for that perusal , I can only look into the phantasmagoria of memory to see what personages of foreign literature start to life at the evocation of their names . The Achilles and Agamemnon of Homer appear and speak with their individual voices ; and Nausicaa is clad with an exquisite immortality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types and noble beings , but no really independent self-subsisting characters . Nor do I find them in Racine , nor in French fiction ? in Stendhal or in Balzac . The truth is , I think , that this kind of creation is a special characteristic of English literature . We may find its roots perhaps in Chaucer , but it was in Shakespeare that it burst into exuberant and amazing blossom ; and it is from Shakespeare that our great novelists derived their conception of it , and their method of portrayal . Continental writers , whose ideal has been , for the most part , the classical one of turning events into ideas , and making them into food for the mind , have found typical personages , rather than " characters , " better and more transparent vehicles for their criticism of life , for their study of human relations and passions and circumstances . There are exceptions no doubt ? there is Cervantes who created Don Quixote ; and there are the Russians , who have imitated English fiction . In our own day also there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest to my fellow-harriers , has succeeded in moulding into living characters , with their own idiosyncrasies of speech , the most subtle complexities of our modern and self-conscious human nature . Nevertheless character-creation as we find it in English literature , is not on the whole an essential element in Continental fiction . If we should attempt to take , from a classical and Continental standpoint , a general view of our English novels , might they not appear , in spite of ? and even perhaps on account of ? their swarming abundance of living characters , somewhat trivial and superficial as analyses of life ? Are not our immense miscellaneous English novels rather like immense picnics and meaningless outings , in which a lot of odd people meet together in irrelevant horse-play , and then separate or pair off for no especial reason ? Are not the different episodes in these novels of more importance than the whole impression they create ? And have the individual characters in them much more than a casual relation with the novel in which they happen to appear ? Could not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in almost any other of his novels ? And has n't the power of creating independent beings in some ways embarrassed even our greatest writers ? Did n't that monster of exuberance , Falstaff , pull down , like Samson , the structure of the plays in which he figured , and even the most consummate of English artists endanger the scheme of his great Epic by making his Devil so much more alive , and so much more interesting , than his God ? " By all means , " a Continental spectator of our coursing might address us , " by all means hunt your hare , and when you catch it and serve it up , we hope that we shall be invited to the feast . The brown hare of your meadows is a creature which , though it sometimes goes mad in March , possesses admirable and even magical properties ? and certainly its antics are a source of inexhaustible amusement . But it is indigenous to England , and is scarcely to be found abroad , save in Russia , whither its breed has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our lievre , is the mountain hare ; to us it seems a creature of a rarer , of a more quintessential , and indeed of an almost divine quality ; and its native home is on those ranges of thought , upon those high , Muse-haunted mountains where the ancient Greeks , not unaccompanied by the Immortals , were wont to pursue the chase .
