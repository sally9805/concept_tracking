As the vacation-bound presidential special crossed South Dakota , the state turned into a 400-mile-long cheering section . Farmers stood in fields of young , ankle-high corn , forgot mortgages and vetoes , cheered . Townspeople gathered at railroad stations ; in their hands were hats and flowers ; in their hearts were peace and goodwill . Senator Peter Norbeck of South Dakota , long an insurgent , exclaimed , " We will not go into past regrets . " Representative Charles A. Christopherson , farm-relief advocate , announced that all doubt concerning a third term had been swept away . The President made no speeches , no promises , receded not an inch from the posi-tion he took in vetoing the McNary-Haugen farm-relief bill ( TIME , March 7 ) . But the honor of his presence , the potency of his office , turned suspicion into acclamation as hostility succumbed to hospitality . Should South Dakota love the President in November as it does in June , the state 's electoral vote seems indeed assured . <P> At Huron , almost the entire population of 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the sunshine state , all the people here are feeling great , " they chanted . A schoolgirl drum-corps accompanied the song , prompted Mrs. Coolidge to call out : " This is better than being in schoof , is n't it ? " Then the crowd sang another song , a parody of the famed Gallagher-Shean melody , ending with the refrain : " Absolutely President Coolidge , South Dakota welcomes you . " Pleased , the President asked for a copy of this song , received a fistful as he extended his arm from the observation car . <P> " It is a beautiful capitol you have , " said President Coolidge to Governor William J. Bulow of South Dakota as he and Mrs. Coolidge inspected the capitol building at Pierre , S. D. , the only western city besides Hammond , Ind. , in which the presidential party left the train . Trucks crowded with cameramen flanked the motor car in which the President and the Governor headed the procession through Pierre streets , snapped the <P> President , bowing , smiling ; snapped Mrs. Coolidge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wild Canterbury bells . The President 's visit started a boom for Governor Bulow for the Democratic nomination to the Vice Presidency . <P> One Hugh Jaynes , for 31 years proprietor of the People 's Meat Market of Pierre , presented the President with a buffalo roast . The roast was certified as pure and wholesome by Game Warden O. H. Johnson . Mr. Jaynes had previously given President Roosevelt a similar buffalo roast , remembered that President Roosevelt had expressed keen enjoyment of it . A cowpuncher also presented the President with 18 Chinese pheasants , hoped that they would be served at the first Custer Park meal . Though making frequent car-end appearances at various brief stops , the President said hardly a word , left greeting-acknowledgments largely to Mrs. Coolidge . Despatches reported that one farmer nudged his wife , observed to her : " He do n't talk ; she does the talking . " <P> An obvious , but forgiving , reference to the President 's veto of the McNary-Haugen bill was found in a poem of welcome printed in the Rapid City Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did you thought was
