txt Debate on the ' Mellon tax-reduction plan began in the House today with speeches by Chairman Green and Representative Garner , the two party leaders of the Ways . and Means Committee , and will continue until Monday afternoon at ' 4 o'clock , when under an agreement obtained today general discussion will cease in order that the income-tax schedules may be taken up and discussed on Tuesday . At the end of the ' Ong day of controversy the Democratic leaders were positive that the 44 per cent . surtax maximum of the Garner plan would be approved by a decisive vote , but the Republicans denied this , saying they already had enough votes counted to substitute a 35 per cent . figure for the Garner rate . Th , e 25 per cent . rate , which President Coolidge urged again in his New York speech Tuesday night , appeared to have been hopelessly lost . In fact , Representative Ogden Mills , one of the Ways and Means Committee Administration Republicans , virtually conceded its defeat when he said on the floor that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority on the income rate vote . Forces Are Lined Up . Every one of the 2gpioes. the HoUizie ? exceptReprese of Virginia was pledged to vote for the 44 per cent . rate through the caucus last night , asserted Representatives Garner and Oldfield of Arkansas , adding that the combination of these 206 , men with the insurgents would furnish five to eight votes more than the necessary majority of 218 . ' Pitted against this assertion was that of Representative Longworth and Representative Begg , who stated that 208 men would support the 35 per cent . rate in preference to the Garner tax . " I am more convinced than ever that the surtax maximum will be considerably under 44'per cent , " Mr. Longworth declared . " We can count on 208 now , and the number is growing . Some members from the Northwest have told us they will not vote to aid a Democratic plan . " The statement by Mr. Mills that the insurgents would desert the Republican fold and combine with Democrats came when he turned to the pitiority and said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Republicans will leave the Republican side and ' walk over in a body to the Democratic side . You will be in the majority then , and it will be your responsibility to see that no b11 passes this House that will not bring in enough revenues . " Criticism of President Coolidge by Representative Garner as having attempted to go over the heads of Congress in an appeal to the people for the Mellon plan brought a rejoinder from Representative Mills , who asserted that Woodrow Wilson had tried to force the Senate into adopting the Versailles treaty . Garner-Mills Clash . " I feel that you Republicans must be humiliated , " said Representative Garner . " I would feel humiliated if the President of my party went to the people and said that you must help me . I would be humiliated if the President found he could not appeal to my good sense and patriotism . For as you go to the people just so do you depreciate the importance of this branch of The Government . I say any man who w &ild; do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President of the United States has no right to appeal to the people to compel Congress to do his bidding . " Do you know of a single gentleman rwho ever appealed over the heads of Congress ? " said Representative Garner . " I 'll name one . " answered Representative Mills . " Not a single one , ? replied Representative Garner , " except an appeal from Congress by an election . " " I 'd say . " shouted Mr. Mills . " that my recollection is that the last Democratic President did that very thing in an attempt to coerce the Senate to ratify the Treaty of Versailles . " A slight echo of the bonus was heard curing the debate when Representative Blanton of Texas bobbed up for a moment to insist upon it . During the day a delegation of the soldier bloc visited Mr. Longworth and expressed their fears that the Ways and Means Committee would delay consideration of their measure . Mr. Longworth assured them this was not the case , that the committee would take up the bill immediately after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill and discussing It does not mean that it will be reported by the committee . and there is no surety now that it will be , even though the majority of the committeemen are supposedly for adjusted compen sa lion The opening speaker was Chairman Green . who went into an explanation of the bill . contrasting its features with those of the Frear and Garner programs . 7. - le steered clear of politics and ! also refrained from advocating the 251 per cent , surtax maximum , which he maintains Is a Treasury suggestion and not necessarily approved by all Ways and Means Republicans . As a matter of fact it was not , for Mr. Green . Mr. Timberlake of Colorado and Mr. ! iicLaughlin of Michigan voted against the other twelve Republicans . It remained for Mr. Garner to start the fireworks . He lost no time ire doing so . quickly interspersing his figures with partisan attacks . In his two hours he concentrated a stiff fire on Repr:e sentative Mills , who was restive und it and broke in time and again with sharp replies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think there was propaganda behind the Mellon bill , let ... him rise in his seat r he challenged the Republicans . He paused , but not a single man rose . Representatives Mills and Longworth sat silent . " Well , that 's unanimous , " commented Mr. Garner , amid handclaps from the Democratic side . " You can write the devil and all his angels into the bill , and let Mr. Mellon have his 2.5 per cent . surtax rate , and he will say to the President , ' take the bill , ' " continued the Democratic leader . " But you ca n't write in a reduction , or he will recommend the President to veto the bill . " Did you ever hear of a Secretary of the Treasury in the history of the country who so boldly insulted the American Congress by demanding that the Congress take his bill intact ? " Mr. Mellon needed some one in the Ways and Means Committee who shared his view on taxes . His object was to relieve the wealthy , so he needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. area- the bill . " I feel sorry for Mr. Green . I love him : - but I know that he was helpless In the hands of Mr. Mills and Mr. Mellon . " It reminds me of two cats playing with a mouse . He squeaked once for 35 per cent. , but they slaughtered him . " Mr. Garner spoke at length on the proposal to place estate taxes in the bill . " Do you suppose Mr. Mills wants the wealth of the country to pay ? ? he asked . " Mr. Mills , you 're the dominant factor in the Ways and Means Committee on the Republican side , and you would not favor an estate tax . " I do say with all the solemnity of my soul , " continued Mr. Garner , now referring to taxation of millionaires , " that there is one office of the Government more able to profit personally than any other department in the civilized world : I mean the United States Treasury . " Six men paid income taxes last year on $:1,000,000 incomes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax . The conditions in the Treasury Department are such that they do n't want to enforce the law and make the rich pay . If we had a Secretary of they Treasury that enforced the law we would have had more than 21,000 millionaires paying income taxes last year . " Representative Garner asked Mr. Mills if he favored an estate tax . " Yes . " Mr. Mills replied . " How much ? " asked Mr. Garner . " Well , " replied Representative Mills , " I 'd leave it at 25 per cent. , for when there are States which take as much as 40 per cent. , a total of 65 per cent . taken out of the capital of an estate in this ( manner , it is quite as much as we are entitled to . " Congress should again submit the matter of taxing stock dividends to the Supreme Court , Representative Garner argued . Representative Woodruff of Michigan broke in : " I think you will find a good many Republicans who would like to vote for - such a proposition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income tax returns . Can we see Mr. Sinclair 's return ? We can not . I would at least have these returns accessible , on demand , to committees of the Senate and House of Representatives . But the Republicans do not want it . " Before he finished Mr. Garner predicted that success for the Mellon plan would mean a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress next year , a statement which drew applause from the minority side . Republican Argument by Mills . Mr. Mills charged that Representative Garner desired to render all but about 1.500,000 taxpayers " politically impotent , " meaning by this that the taxpaYera relieved through the Garner exemptions would feel under obligations to the Democratic Party . " The Democrats are not politically responsible in this House , " continued Mr. Mills . " They are in the minority and therefore it is apparently legitimate for them to bring In a bill that will not function . But Mr. Garner and his fellow Democrats are not bearing the fight in the open . They want to insure the defeat of the Mellon plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the needed revenue . " Mr. McCoy , ? the Treasury expert . made the statement to the Ways and means Committee yesterday that if the Garner plan was accepted It would mean tin , loss of $511,000,000 . That means that it is impracticable and that it must be redrafted by Tuesday next or the Democrats will lay themselves open to a charge of defeating the bill indirectly . " Democrats charged that the claim by Mr. Mills that the Democratic bill would not raise sufficient revenue was really aimed at the bonus , but Representative Mills replied : " If the Administration wanted to defeat the bonus it would compel every member to vote for the Garner plan . " Now take the poor man about whom a good deal has been said here today . Two per cent . of the saving is for those who have incomes of less than $10,000 , 15 per cent . from incomes above 50,000 . Only 3 per cent . comes from the incomes above $100,000 . " At the conclusion of his speech . Representative Mills charged that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce taxes so greatly es to cause a deficit and disorganise the Treasury , Or to load the tax reduction bill down so that President Coolidge would be compelled to veto it . Representative Oldfield of Arkansas , who followed Mr. Mills said : " If any one says the Mellon bill will raise more money with a 25 per cent . rate than the Garner plan with a 44 per cent . rate they are not correct . It is a silly statement to believe men will pay less under higher surtaxes than under lower rates . " Mr. Oldfield linked the arguments of the Republicans for low surtaxes with the repeal of the excess profits tax by the Republicans in 1920 , which , he said , relievecl the rich of $ ? 50,000,000 of taxes annually . " Does not the . gentleman know , " interjected Chairman Green . " that his candidate for President , Governor Cox , went up and clown the'country in 1920 arguing against the excess profits tax ? " " I do n't care what Governor Cax said on that matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was a boon to the rich . " Representatives Kearns of Ohio and Young of North Dakota , two Republicans , spoke for the Mellon plan , and Representative Dickinson of Missouri , Democrat , against it . The debate will continue from 11 A. M. WA 4 P. M. tomorrow , ?
