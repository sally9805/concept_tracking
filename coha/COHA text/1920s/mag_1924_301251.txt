Strongest opposition was expressed last week by America 's most prominent educators to the Sterling-Reed Bill , which would create a Federal Department of Education under a new cabinet officer , would give federal aid to local schools , and , in general , would increase federal control of education . <P> Administrative objections were made by President Goodnow of Johns Hopkins . Constitutional objections were made by two Baltimore lawyers-W . L. Marbury , W. F. Rawls . <P> Letters from many college presidents were put into the record of the House Committee now considering the bill . <P> Wrote President Lowell of Harvard : <P> " There is substantially no part of the country today , that can not afford such elementary and secondary education , as it really desires ; and to give Federal subventions to any part of the country to support education which it does not really desire would seem to be not only wasteful , but demoralizing . The plan of a department of education , alone with a member of the Cabinet at its head , would seem to me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitably be given to a politician not large enough in calibre for one of the greater offices . " <P> Wrote Dr. Harry Pratt Judson , President Emeritus of the University of Chicago : " The existing bureau may have added powers without detriment , its function of gathering and distributing educational information may be made more effective-but I earnestly hope that no bill will pass which distributes more Federal funds for State functions . What the country needs is less taxes rather than more expenses . "
