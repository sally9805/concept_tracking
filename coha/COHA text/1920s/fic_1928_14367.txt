Mabel Hargrave , an over-heavy dropsical woman of about thirty-five , is sitting before the dead fire one warm winter night . She is rocking back and forth , back and forth , and now and then she tosses her head as if on the point of hysterical abandonment . She sits with her pudgy shapeless legs straddled wide apart , a loose wrapper billowing down over her swollen form . In the centre of the poverty-stricken room is a table with a lamp and the remnants of a meal  --  dirty dishes , crumbs over the oil-cloth and on the floor , a bench and several chairs and a baby 's high chair standing empty around the table . In the corner of the room is a narrow bed on which a man lies stretched out asleep . At the rear is a door from beyond which comes the sound of children quarreling and crying . Mabel is talking furiously to the inert form on the bed . MABEL ( Rocking . ) I keep telling you to git up and eat your supper . I keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's cold , cold . The coffee 's cold . I ca n't keep it hot all night . ( She shakes her head and tickles her forehead nervously with her fingers . The sleeper hears her , for his snores die away a moment . ) Why do n't you answer me ? Wake up , wake up ! Oh , you worry me to death , you worry me Slam to death you and the children do . Listen at ' em . ( Calling . ) You children git quiet , you 're driving me distracted . Bud , git up , I tell you . ( Waving her hands . ) I ca n't stand much more of it all , Bud , I ca n't , I tell you . ( Piteously . ) I do n't believe I 'll live through it this time , Bud . Honest I think it 'll kill me off . I got terrible pains in my back and legs and they get worse , worse . It 's a month till my time and I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickles her forehead with her fingers. ) p. 3 BUD ( Shaking the bed as he turns over . ) For God 's sake be quiet ! MABEL Oh , yes , yes , yes , yes . Be quiet ! It scares me , scares me to fits to think of it . The doctor said not to have another one . You better not have another baby , he said . He told you too . Yes , yes , be quiet , be quiet . ( She rocks and keeps rocking . There is a dull bump in the room at the rear , followed by a child 's soreaming . Mabel yells out shrilly . ) Stop it , stop it ! If you do n't stop that cutting up , I 'll come in there and beat the stuffing out of you . ( But there is no ceasing of the clamor . ) Henry , Henry ! Hen-er-y ! Help Flossie back in that bed . Go to sleep , you children , go to sleep , I tell you . ( A little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door at the rear . ) BOY Ma , Jimmy kicked Flossie in the face and knocked her off'n the bed . MABEL ( Waving her hands before her again . ) Do n't come to me with no tales . ( Yelling . ) Jimmy , if you touch that girl again I 'll come in there and blister you . BOY I tried to get him to quit it and he pinched me . MABEL Git back in that bed , Henry . You 're like your old grand-daddy Hargrave . If anybody looked at him he 'd whimper. p. 4 BOY I want some water . CHILDREN ( From the rear . ) I want some water , Ma , we want some water ! MABEL I reckon you do . Sure you want water .

CHILDREN We want some water ! MABEL Look at him drinking his head off . He 'll be sick . No , he wo n't be sick . He 'll wet the bed , and then wake up a-crying in the middle of the night . Lordy mercy , look at him . He 's tore his drawers all to pieces . BOY ( Timidly pulling his underclothes together where a big patch is torn from the rear . ) Walter got hold of it and tore it out , Me . MABEL ( Rocking , always rocking . ) Walter , I 'll git a switch to your back in the morning , you see if I do n't ! p. 5 CHILDREN Henry 's had some water . We want some . MABEL Take the bucket in there and fill ' em up . ( Screaming . ) And the first one of you wets the bed tonight ' ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll whip you , you hear ! ( The boy takes the bucket and goes out . Mabel goes on rocking and talking to the man on the bed . ) You better git up . You better git right up and go in there and tend to them children . I ca n't do it , Bud . I ai n't able to git out of this chair . I 'm gitting too heavy to move about . ( Tickling her forehead again . ) I oughter be in the bed . I oughter be in the bed there where you are , Bud . BOY Jimmy wo n't let me have no water ! ( A loud wailing and kicking sets up in the rear room . ) BUD ( Throwing his legs out of the bed and sitting up . ) Who in the hell could sleep ? Who in the hell could sleep in such a furce ? ( Bud is a little unshaven man about thirty-seven , with a mean quick eye , and a mighty voice . He has been drinking and his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help the fuss . BUD No , you ca n't help it . You always say you never ca n't help it . MABEL Well , I can't. p. 6 BUD That 's what I said . ( Shouting . ) Stop that racket in there . MABEL Jimmy and Walter been fighting . They all the time fighting or doing something . ( Shaking her head . ) Or doing something . ( Bud gets up and goes into the room at the rear and is heard spanking a child . ) BUD ( Within . ) Dry up , dry up , I tell you ! MABEL ( Crying out . ) Stop it , Bud . You 'll kill him . BUD ( Coming in and hitching up his overalls . ) Now I reckon by God they 'll be quiet . ( Growling . ) Be quiet , I tell you . ( The children grow still as mice . Bud belches and eyes the table distastefully . ) You all done had supper ? MABEL We wanted and waited . The children were hungry , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BUD I reckon I heard you . And I reckon they heard you all down the street . God A'mighty , I never saw such a house ! MABEL I ca n't help it . BUD Oh no , you ca n't help it .

MABEL I do n't see why you treat me so . BUD Starting it up again . ( Slouching down by the table and beginning to eat . ) Hah , this son-of-a-bitching headache . Feel like my head 'll bust . MABEL If you 'd quit that mean liquor . BUD Yeh , and what other fun do I git ?  --  Where 's the coffee ? MABEL On the stove . You 'll have to git it yourself , Bud . I ai n't able to git up and wait on you . BUD ( Stumbling across the room and fetching his coffee . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several cups of coffee and then flings the pot away from him with an oath . ) You call that coffee ? MABEL I do n't know . Oh , I do n't know . It tasted all right to me . The children made no complaint . They liked it . ( Weaving her head about . ) I do n't know . It may be bad . I do n't know . My taste 's gone from me . Everything tastes alike to me . I feel like I got give in my mouth all the time . BUD ( Eyeing her . ) I wish to God you 'd quit that rocking . Rock , rock , rock . When I leave in the morning you 're rocking and when I come home at night you 're at it . Rock , rock , rock . ( She stops a moment but soon begins it again unconsciously. ) p. 8 MABEL ( After a moment . ) I  --  I feel sorter bad about this evening , Bud .

And I 've heard fem laughing and a-snickering at us before . They 're young but they know a lot of things . They know babies do n't come out of stumps either . BUD What the hell do I care ?

God A'mighty runs the weather and the landlord runs the books , and between them the tenant gits nothing . ( Striking the table with his fist . ) Nothing , I tell you . MABEL ( Timidly . ) I liked it better there . BUD Yes you did , and who in the hell was it always talking about it being so lonesome there ? You was . I tried both of ' em  --  factory and farming .

( Cackling . ) Heaven ! You 'll hit hell bottom like a shot of lead . p. 10 MABEL ( Now beginning to whine as the pace of her rocking increases . ) Oh yes , cuss and complain ! It ai n't my fault .

I said to myself , I ca n't stand this no more , I 'm going to show it to him . And he 'll see what he 's brung me to . It 'll crucify his soul in him if he 's got a soul left . BUD ( Knocking her hand away . ) I do n't want to see it . MABEL It 's a picture of you and me that Walter Maynard took with his kodak one Sunday .

MABEL ( Still looking at the photograph . ) Nobody would know that 's me . Such a sweet girl . I remember that day same as yesterday . The weather was fair , and we were standing by the rose-bush in the corner of the yard when it was took I 've got on the shirt-waist I made the day before . Ma ruffled it under the presser-foot , and all the time we were talking about you . And I was telling her about your brown eyes .

The threads kept a-breaking . I could n't help it . The boss-man gim me hell . He said " You used to be the best beamer around , Bud . What 's got wrong ? " I did n't say nothing , I could n't say nothing . I could n't say " My wife made the threads break , Mr. Webb . It 's my wife keeps a-breaking the threads . " I could n't say that . He 'd a-laughed at me , would n't he ? MABEL Oh yes , you could say it . Blame it all on me . ( Gasping . ) It wo n't matter in a little while . I 'll be dead . I 'll be dead , I tell you .

I 'm afraid of the house and everything around me ! p. 14 BUD ( Sneering . ) My gracious , are you ? MABEL ( Tickling her forehead again . ) There 's something wrong inside my head . Last night I woke up and I heard the children crying . They were all asleep but I heard ' em crying , way deep in my head  --  Jimmy and Walter and Mary , all of ' em crying inside my head . ( She shivers in her chair and goes on rocking . ) The doctor 's give me some medicine to take , but I ca n't buy no more , and the drug-store wo n't charge it . ( Piteously . ) Just half of what you spend for that liquor would help me . It would help me a whole lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to want me to give that up too . It 's the only pleasure I get in this world and I 'm going to have it . ( Striding up and down the room . ) In the morning at five o'clock the old whistle ' ll blow me out of bed , and I got to rise and go . You and the God-damn younguns can sleep , but I got to go . ( Half sobbing . ) I ai n't nothing but a slave . Talk about the nigger being in slavery . I 'm worse ' n a nigger . All of us is slaves , all the mill-folks is slaves . ( Brandishing his hands . ) The God-damn mill-owners ride about in their big cars and their sons and daughters waste and strew the money I help to make . And they look down on me like a dog . I hope every last son-of-a-bitching one of ' em rots in hell . ( Whining . ) Rock , rock , rock ! Stop it , for God 's sake stop it ! ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room at the rear . Like caged squirrels they scream and whirl about the room before him as he strikes at them with a heavy strap . ) I 'll beat hell out'n you , I tell you ! p. 15 MABEL ( Rocking . ) Oh , do n't hurt ' em . ( Yelling . ) Do n't you hurt them babies , Bud Hargrave ! Come back and eat your supper . ( She tickles her forehead and goes on pouring a flood of words in his direction. )
