txt This year colleges in forty-five states are giving courses in agricultural economics and allied subjects , including marketing cooperation , farm management and commercial geography . The meaning of this is that a revolution , bloodless but of far-reaching effect , is now under way in the United States . C- .. Oucazion is working an agricultural revolution that is bound to add enormously to the prosperity of this country . The Department of Agriculture at Washington has been the starting point . Its scientific and research work has added untold millions , and perhaps billions , to our agricultural wealth . Texas fever cost cattle raisers over $100,000,000 a year until a scientist in that department located the cause . Incidently. this discos cry led to the arrest , conviction and execution of the malarial and yellow fever-carrying mosquito . Hog cholera cost many millions more'until a serum was made to prevent it . The introduction of the navel orange , durum wheat . Egyptian cotton and many improved grains , grasses and fruits by this department has been of almost priceless service . - Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm boys have been reached and taught scientific farming and livestock breeding . They are flocking now to the agricultural colleges where , in addition to other things , they will learn about the soil , how through it to feed the plants and secure the greatest production possible . They will learn how to care fur livestock and breed and develop profitable animals . So important is this work that a party of boys from one of the colleges is now on the way to England to study seine of the leading herds of cattle . Larger crops and larger livestock returns are to be expected limn such instruction . One great evil today is that the farmer gets ta.o small a percentage of what the consumer pays for his products . There is great need for improvement here . and there is bound to be a change for the better when a large percentage of the farms is directed by men who farm from the neck up . The country will receive much benefit from this because it prospers most when the farmers prosper . The only ones to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most fertile soil for their work . But the country as a whole . will rejoice to see the agricultural revolution grow and spread from sea to sea .
