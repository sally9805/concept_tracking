Outer Mongolia and Inner Mongolia are two seminomadic lands of indefinite status , lying north of China proper and adjoining Manchuria . Last week a whooping pack of Outer Mongolian cavalry swooped into Manchuria and cut the Chinese Eastern Railway at Khailar , near Barin , where four U. S. citizens reside . <P> The raiders were led by Soviet Russian General Sulkovsky . Though details were meagre it appeared that a local chieftain " Prince " Gaifu , had resisted certain demands made upon him by the Outer Mongolian Soviet Republic and was being trounced . <P> Observers feared lest this local engagement prove part of a Soviet project to coerce the chieftains of Inner Mongolia and North Eastern Manchuria into federating themselves with the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics ( " Russia " ) .
