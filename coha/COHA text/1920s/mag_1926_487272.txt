This is the last of a series of three articles describing the author 's trip across Mongolia from the Chinese to the Trans-Siberian Railway . T HREE days were usually needed to obtain permission to leave Mongolia , but Nikiforoff , the Russian Consul , was eager to be rid of a troublesome visitor , and sent his secretary with me to make the rounds of the magnificent collection of secret-service , passport , and police departments with which the would-be modern Mongols toy . Cars started for Siberia , so read the announcement in the Russian news-Taper of Urga , every Saturday at nine . At 9:30 a boy came to inquire whether I really wanted to leave that day . They would rather , he said , wait until Monday . I explained that I wanted to catch the weekly Trans-Siberian express on Wednesday . The boy took the message ; an hour later he returned to say that the ice on the- rivers was breaking , and it was doubtful whether we could make the , Wednesday train anyway . I replied that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once and be sure of the next week 's train . And finally , after long discussions , it was so agreed . The nine o'clock car called for me at half past two . The chauffeur , Mikhail Vassilievich , was an American-type lad , clever with his hands and quick at invention ; the other passengers were his sister , returning to Moscow ; Bajin , a merchant , and a peasant who lived eighty versts from Urga . None of them spoke any Western language but Russian . Down the side-valleys into Urga thousands of ox-carts were pouring  --  long caravans of two or three hundred , each cart loaded with a huge section of tree-trunk , or with chunks of charcoal , the last two or three with hay to feed the oxen on the long trek from the forest to the city . The Holy Mountain across the river is tree-covered with the only trees for forty miles , but the wood of the sacred mountain may not be cut . Until dark we tugged up through one rolling bare valley after another , lifeless except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hills reminded one of those magnificent pictures of more Western hills in " Grass . " We crossed three passes before dark , always to find new mountains opening before us . The road was a camel-track , sometimes barely wide enough for a car , sometimes broadening hundreds of yards wide across the meadows where camels and ox-carts had sought fresh routes in place of trodden mire . Sometimes it disappeared in hard hummocky meadows or hillsides of jagged rocks . The driver , who had never been over the route before , kept his eyes glued on the ruts of a previous car . It was nine o'clock when we came to a river  --  and the tracks were lost . The ice was broken ; melting snow had swollen the current . Passengers piled out ; we hunted the valley up and down for a possible ford , or for tracks of the preceding car . But it had done as we  --  crawled to the edge of the river at a score of points , and then backed out . At one point the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , above his waist in ice-water . It was midnight before we finally found automobile tracks that entered the river ; we tested the depth with a stick , slipped gently into the stream , and roared safely up the opposite bank with a cheer . And it was after midnight when we routed out the Chinese keepers of a lonely mountain inn and had a belated supper . We rose at four the next morning , and were off soon after five , with tea and bread inside us . About ten we came to the home of our peasant-passenger , a lone pioneer log cabin away up in one of the high Mongolian valleys . He had hauled his wood thirty miles , built his own house and barns , and was enormously proud of his work . Even his furniture was home-made , except for an American Singer sewing machine ! He gave us fresh boiled eggs , and fresh milk , and soft home-made bread , baked from his own wheat ' flour . There are scores of such Russian frontiersmen pushing their way into Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mongols , desperately afraid that their grazing-land will be lost , oust them on any excuse . The mountains lay cold and bare to the south but warmly birch-wooded on the northern slopes . We ran smoothly from one valley to another , then down to the ford of the Khara-gol River . But the ice was out at the edges and the water flowing swiftly . A lone Mongol on horseback made his - way through the water and across the ice , but there was no hope for a heavy car . We backed off and tried again , and again . But the spring warmth was against us , and the black water turned us away . Twenty miles downstream , the Mongol told us , was a wooden bridge  --  almost the only bridge in Mongolia . We found the bridge but could not get to it . One route after another across the soggy meadows proved impossible . The road for a mile short of the bridge was a canal of deep , soft , moving mud . We tried it once , and worked for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Deep ditches three feet wide , with swirling water , ran on either side of it , and shallow mud-lakes lay beyond these . Finally Bajin and I , prospecting on foot , worked out a route which lay across meadows part of which were under water but at least seemed snow-covered or grassy , not mere mud . The car maneuvered into position , attacked the course , ran half way smoothly , then stopped , up to the hubs in ice-water . There was nothing to do but push  --  not a living soul within twenty miles ; not a service-station within three hundred . Bajin and I rolled our trousers to the knees , which was sometimes not enough , took off shoes and stockings , and for the next two hours waded among ice-cakes , adding our feeble man-power to the sturdy engine of the car . By midafternoon we were within a few yards of the- bridge  --  with the swirling ditch still in front of us . We spent the rest of the afternoon tearing up a corduroy road and building a bridge across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , and sped , at a perilous angle , along the edge of the mountain , across the valley , the road being deep in water ; then turned north again , over more Alpine passes . I have seldom seen a lovelier sunset than that night , the sky 's fire reflected from a thousand pools in the river-bottom  --  but the chauffeur , who knew that the road lay through those flaming pools , was utterly unmoved when I pointed to the reflections . Four more rivers we crossed the next day . The ice was gone from the first , and the stream was too deep for a Dodge unaided . We unlashed the bags from the running-boards and piled them high inside the car , took out the carbtireter , greased the rest of the engine , and hired two horses to haul us through . The second river we boldly forded . The third , after long hesitations and testings , we crossed on the ice  --  safely . The fourth , ' the Ura , was a longer story . The ice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the center ice seemed solid . From the near shore the Mongols had built a log bridge out to the solid ice ; on the north side the ice came so close to the sloping shore that it seemed safe . We reinforced the log bridge ; the car gently slid across it , raced across the ice for the far shore , when  --  crack ! the Dodge plunged through , whirred a moment , and lapsed into discouraging silence . And there it sat , in the river above the hubs , water flowing through the bottoms of both my bags . Fortunately , we were close to a Mongol village , and they had a boat . We were ferried-to dry land ; again we rolled up our trousers and waded in ; we hitched a dozen ropes to the car , and Mongols , Russians , and American slowly hauled the car out of the river and up on the sand . Toward evening I saw mountain-peaks to the north which looked blue instead of brown ; and suddenly I became aware that their skylines were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . The ranges flattened out and the country softened . Aspens , birches , and pines mingled with one another  --  occasionally we actually ran through forest , as one never does in lowland China or in high Mongolia . We passed tiny villages of Russian pioneers ? pushing into the wilderness , building their own houses , and contriving their own machinery , self-dependent a n d re-s our cef u 1 ? the Americans of the next century . That third night we reached Troitskosaysk , the frontier town , a n d slept , with an army of cockroaches , in a Russian inn . Customs officials can not be hurried . It was easyenough to get out of Mongolia , but it took most of a day to get into Russia . Every parcel and paper was pried into . With some difficulty I conveyed the idea that I still hoped to catch the weekly train next afternoon , and at length we set out again . More rolling birch-and-pine country that evening , and more deep sand . It seemed strange but friendly to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight , just short of the great Selenga River , we roused a peasant village and found a. family willing to take us in for the night and give us tea . The air struck one in the face as the door opened  --  it must have been carefully preserved all winter  --  and eleven people were more or less asleep on the floor , including a sick baby ; but when I attempted casually to lean against the door and keep it open for a minute they came to me and pointed out that the malinka was ailing and must not suffer fresh air . I slept in the car , and got four and a half hour 's better sleep than I had had since Urga . Mongol huts have one advantage over Russian  --  they leak air . The great Selenga River lay ahead , a big navigable stream , to be crossed twice . But the Selenga ice was stronger than we knew . It had broken a bit at the edges , but log bridges had been laid , and we were past the first crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town dominated by two huge green-roofed , bluebulbed churches  --  and then wandered miles out of our course . But finally we came upon the new road which marks the route of the future Trans-Mongolian Railroad , and while it was soft and unfinished , most of the lesser bridges had been built and were usable . Wind drove the loose sand into our faces , but we were covering the miles . Our long detour and the bad roads , however , had cost us so much gas that the chauffeur was doubtful whether we could get through . At 1:30 we were only thirty versts from the goal , the meter showed one and a half gallons of gas , and we stopped to eat . Five miles short of the railroad t h e meter showed zero , but the car puffed on , and we caught the weekly train with half an hour to spare ! And that is the route over which some say Russia ships great quantities of munitions to her friends in China ! Six days crossing the snowy plains of Siberia  --  endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking forward to a boundless future with a boundless self-confidence . Siberia is American in its spaciousness , its optimism , its faith in its future . Four days in Moscow , where Henry Ford and Lenin are enshrined as twin gods , where a cult of American mechanism is arising , along with new skyscrapers , electric sky-signs , and even talk of a subway , and mingles its familiar jargon ? with the lingo of communist ideals . Two more days , and I was back in Western Europe , where frontiers huddle on frontiers , where men bathe and talk familiar languages and wear familiar clothes  --  a land achingly nostalgic , living on memories of the good old days before the war , praying for restoration , reconstruction , rebuilding , always looking backward . A continentwhere the great races of the nineteenth century do not know that their moment of history is done . China still slumbers , perhaps  --  but she has never lost faith in herself , and today , with the weapons of the West in hand , retains her ancient pride in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an interlude , a dying race that once ravaged a continent awakening , as all Asia will awaken , and rubbing its eyes in a new dawn ; Russia is a bridge between East and West , enormous , a young people four times as numerous as America was a half century ago and as sure of an infinitely expanding future  --  and the little crowded countries that have made history on that Western plain of Europe , blinking behind their customs frontiers and separate armies and diplomatic staffs and mutual hates and jealousies , seem pitiful , lost , unimportant in comparison with these mighty peoples . China , Russia , America  --  these are nations of the future . They are none of them meek , but they will inherit the earth .
