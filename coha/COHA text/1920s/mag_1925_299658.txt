In June , 1916 , the British cruiser Hampshire struck a mine and the British Commonwealth suffered the loss of Field Marshal Horatio Herbert Kitchener , Earl Kitchener of Khartum , " the greatest soldier-statesman of the century . " <P> In London , last week , a book by one V. W. Germains , entitled The Truth About Kitchener , was published . In it appears a letter by no less a person than Germany 's faded star , General Erich von Ludendorff . Writing to the author , General Ludendorff first apostrophised the late Field Marshal , then proceeded : <P> " His mysterious death was the work neither of a German mine nor a German torpedo , but of the power which would not permit the Russian Army to recover with the help of Lord Kitchener because the destruction of Czarist Russia had been determined upon . Lord Kitchener 's death was caused by his ability . " <P> It was recalled that Germany was the last nation in the War to desire the rehabilitation of the Tsar 's army ( for which purpose Kitchener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolutionaries for the express purpose of demoralizing not only the military but the civil power . It is a matter of common knowledge that this insidious bit of weltpolitik was only too successful ; and it hardly seems possible that Germany can escape the responsibility ( as an act of war ) for Kitchener 's death . <P> Sir George Arthur , Lord Kitchener 's biographer and private secretary , was not slow to add his testimony : <P> " There is no question . . . that the secret of Kitchener 's visit to Russia was betrayed by Russia to Germany , and as a result Germany made special preparations . And we know the name of the officer who laid the mine . <P> " Whether the secret was given away by Russia to prevent the Russian Army from recovering with Kitchener 's help I can not say , but of the betrayal there can be no question .
