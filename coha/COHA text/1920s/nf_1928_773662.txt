txt // appear with the exception of one ( Fig. 261 ) . The ducts of the ventral components are called Wirsung 's ducts , while that of the dorsal pancreas is named the duct of Santorini . In some forms these ducts unite either with each other to make a common duct , or with the bile duct . In lampreys all the ducts are lost , the secretion of the pancreas consequently becoming entirely endocrine , that is , distributed by the blood rather than poured directly to the outside or into some passage-way . In general it may be said that the pancreas is a gland of dual character , since , in addition to its production of digestive pancreatic juice that is poured into the intestine through ducts , there are present in the pancreatic tissue certain distinct intertubercular cell aggregates , also entodermal in origin , called the islands of Langerhans ( Fig. 262 ) , which secrete substances of a character quite different from the pancreatic juice itself , that are carried to all parts of the body through the circulating blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original entodermal outgrowths from the embryonic gut , or the islands of Langerhans , represents the original pan-creatic material , and whether one has , or has not , been derived from the other by modification , is still a matter of controversy . It may be pointed out that the islands of Langerhans are invariably present in all true vertebrates and are undoubtedly early settlers if not the first inhabitants , whereas the other secreting cells are wanting in certain vertebrates . For instance , there is no trace of a pancreas in amphioxus , and in elasmobranch fishes only the dorsal pancreas // develops , with its ductus Santorini . In sturgeons the pancreas is made up of two dorsal and two ventral components with only the right ventral duct remaining . Moreover , in bony fishes and the lower vertebrates generally , the pancreas is primitive in character , being widely diffuse and irregular in form . Among mammals also there is great variety in the form , position , and size of this important gland . A single surviving pancreatic duct is found in man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embryonic components . Three enzymes that aid in the digestive processes are furnished by the pancreatic juice , namely , amylopsin , which like the ptyalin of the saliva acts upon carbohydrates ; trypsin , which modifies proteins ; and steapsin , which breaks up fats . These three digestive enzymes , therefore , are prepared to render the three fundamental kinds of food , carbohydrates , proteins , and fats , fit for transference through the blood to all parts of the body . In man about a pint and a half of such digestive pan-creatic juice is poured daily into the . intestine . The activating substance , or hormone , that is diverted from the islands of Langerhans into the blood , has to do with the utilization of sugar in the tissues , and its failure to be produced in sufficient quantity results in diabetes . A curious modification of the pancreatic apparatus which not infrequently appears , particularly in the cat , is the pancreatic bladder or reservoir-like enlargement of the pancreatic duct for the temporary storage of excessive secretion , an organ quite comparable with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liver ( Fig. 263 ) . C. INTESTINAL GLANDS In addition to the liver and pancreas , the secretions of which are mixed with the food in the duodenum , there are numerous smaller glands occupying the walls of the intestinal tract , that likewise make chemical contributions essential to digestion in the form of an intestinal juice , suecus entericus . Among mammals there are at least two kinds of intestinal // glands , known as Brunner 's glands and the glands of Lieberkuhn . The former are more in evidence in herbivorous mammals than in carnivores , their occurrence being greater at the pyloric end of the duodenum than at its posterior end where the ducts from the liver and pancreas enter the tube . They produce an acid secretion that is chemically somewhat like that of the gastric glands of the stomach . The glands of Lieberkuhn , which produce an alkaline secretion , are vastly more numerous and extend throughout the entire length of the small intestine , particularly from the duodenal region on . They are arranged not only around the bases of the villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also occupy the walls of tiny sunken pits , or crypts , which are interspersed among the villi like deep gorges between steep mountains . These crypts ( Fig. 253 ) increase the surface of the small intestine and are to be regarded only as mechanical devices for surface enlargement rather than as essential parts of the glands themselves . In the epithelium of the duodenum , according to Bayliss and Stirling , there is produced under the chemical stimulation of the acidulated food mass , or chyme , that enters the intestine from the pyloric opening of the stomach , a " hormone , " called pancreatic secretin , which is carried by the blood to the pancreas where it excites that gland into activity . This reaction occurs only when food enters into the intestine , otherwise the pancreatic juice , if continuously produced , would much of the time be wasted . The three pancreatic enzymes , amylopsin , trypsin , and steapsin , being ineffective in an acid medium such as is produced by the action of the gastric glands of the stomach and by the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to change the acid food mass to an alkaline character before these indispensable agents of digestion can do their work . It seems , therefore , to be the mission of the innumerable Lieberkuhn glands , aided by the bile from the liver , to change the intestinal food content from an acid to an alkaline character , so that the pancreatic enzymes will have a suitable medium in which to perform their function . In addition to the three pancreatic enzymes , the succus entericus contains certain enzymes of its own which play a part in the complicated chemical preparation of the food for its absorption // into the blood . Thus , enterokinase is an activating agent that is particularly effective in stimulating trypsin to do its work on protein foods ; maltase splits sugars , and crepsin and nuclease are still other known enzymes produced by the intestinal glands which take part in accomplishing the marvel of transmuting one organism along the food route into the substance of another . From the reptiles on and particularly in the mammals , the lining of the small intestine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patches of reticular connective tissue , Peyer 's patches , in which lymphocytes are enmeshed , and over which the villi are absent . These patches , which have already been mentioned in connection with the ileum , facilitate the absorption of certain components of the liquefied food . VI . EGRESSIVE ZONE The large intestine constitutes the egressive portion of the alimentary tract through which the residue of the food mass is forwarded for expulsion after the usable part has been diverted through the walls of the small intestine into the blood . Its diminished importance in the essential work of the alimentary tract may account in part for the relative absence of structural modifications designed to increase its inner surface . Except in the embryo it is without the villi which characterize the small intestine and , although Lieberkuhn glands are present along its endothelial lining in lessening numbers , glandular secretions are not so much concerned with chemical digestion as with the mechanical lubrication of the feces , from which the water content has been largely withdrawn into the blood stream . In man the large intestine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colon , with ascending , transverse , and descending parts , and the rectum , ending at the anal opening ( Fig. 246 ) . The colic caecum and the processus vermiformis , already mentioned , also belong to the large intestine . The same distinctions characterize the large intestine of many mammals but are not so apparent in other vertebrates , since only the rectum of mammals is homologous with the large intestine of lower vertebrates . In the pipefish , Sygnathus , the stickleback , Gasterosteus , and some other fishes , the " large intestine " is actually smaller than the small intestine . In man the colon , which is arched around the coiled small // intestine , is characterized by three narrow bands of longitudinal muscles , the taeniv coli , that pull this part of the intestine together so as to form three rows of pouches , or haustra , along its entire length , a modification present in varying degree in the large intestine of other mammals . Attached to the external wall of the haustra there are also many little processes of connective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epiploice ( Fig. 213 ) , but neither the haustra nor the appendices epiploicm extend to the rectum . In birds the rectal region of the large intestine is notably reduced . Since it is a disadvantage for these aerial creatures to carry about an unnecessary weight of useless fecal material , the provision for its temporary retention is curtailed , the excreta being disposed of as rapidly as they are produced . Metchnikof , as well as others , has pointed out that the large intestine in man , particularly in the rectal region , is a danger zone , a veritable " sewage swamp , " because bacteria of various kinds flourish upon the undigested residue of the food there retained , contaminating the body constantly with the fermentive and toxic by-products of their metabolism . In a tabulation of 1,148 cases of cancer of the alimentary tract , eighty-nine per cent were located in the susceptible region of the rectum . There are some obvious advantages to mankind in possessing a voluminous rectum where excreta may be temporarily held so that their evacuation may be timed and controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the disadvantages are far from negligible . It is somewhat difficult to see how such an unfortunate evolutionary acquisition could have been fostered by natural selection , but the fact that it reaches its greatest elaboration in herbivorous mammals where it is still useful in caring for plant foods rich in cellulose , may give some hint of why such a danger zone came to be acquired and preserved in man . In the lower vertebrates including the monotremes among mammals , the rectum opens into the cloaca , which is a postanal // chamber receiving not only the feces from the digestive tube but also contributions from the genital and urinary ducts . The rectum ends with the anus , which is closed by a sphincter muscle under control of the will unlike the other circular muscles of the digestive tract that accomplish segmentation and peristalsis under involuntary control . The inner walls of the rectum in man are modified by two or three transverse crescentic shelflike folds , the rectal valves ( Fig. 264 ) , which are doubtless adaptations to erect posture , since they are absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anal sphincter . VII . THE ESSENTIALS OF DIGESTION A summary of the chemical adventures of food ( luring its passage through the digestive tube , is shown in the appended diagram ( Fig. 265 ) . The blood stream receives the food from the small intestine after it has been reduced to absorbable , liquid form . This reduction is partly mechanical , but it involves above all things a chemical breakdown that is actuated by enzymes . The irregular lines in the diagram indicate the particular glands from which each enzyme arises , and . at the wavy interval of the line , the general locality in the digestive tract where it is effective and the kind of food involved in each case . CHAPTER XII INTERNAL TRANSPORTATION ( CIRCULATORY SYSTEM ) I. IN GENERAL The circulatory system is the mechanism that attends to the needful transportation of various substances within the organism . Not only are food , water , and air taken into the animal body , but these indispensable substances are also delivered to each living cell wherever located , otherwise life would cease . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes common to all living things , must be collected for elimination from every cellular nook and cranny of the body , and transported either directly to the outside or to passages leading to the outside . In microscopic unicellular animals , internal transportation is accomplished by the movement of the cytoplasm within the cell itself . It is easy to see how particles of matter , once introduced into a protozoan like Ameba , for example , whose insides flow like cold molasses , may shift their position within the cell body . This intracellular cytoplasmic movement , which is the most primitive kind of a circulatory system , is entirely adequate for bodies of microscopic mass , and always remains as the final essential phase of circulation even in organisms built up of countless cellular units , since intake materials must not only reach each individual cell , but become incorporated and circulated therein as well . In many-celled forms , however , most of the component cells do not have direct surface exposure to the environment . The only way food , water , and air can enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either through , or between , the cells that form the body . The passing of materials through from one cell to another by osmosis is so slow and indirect a method that the ultimate cell in the line receives only what is left after all the intervening ones have taken their toll . It is a great improvement , therefore , when passageways are opened up between the cells so that materials may he forwarded freely , thus reaching the ultimate cells directly and easily without repeated osmotic 307 30S BIOLOGY OF VERTEBRATES manipulation . The same sort of an advance in efficiency is seen when fire fighters substitute a hose line for a makeshift hand to hand " bucket brigade . " The circulatory system proper may be briefly described as consisting of such a series of passage-ways throughout the body , together with a fluid vehicle , both blood and lymph , for transporting various materials , and lastly , a mechanism for sending this fluid through the channels . IL BLOOD AND LYMPH ( THE CARRIERS ) 1 . General Uses of the Blood Mephistopheles , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he exclaims : " Blut ist ein ganz besonderer Saft " ( Blood is a very peculiar fluid . ) In the first place it is not a lifeless fluid , but a circulating tissue , made up of detached , living cells floating in a liquid plasma and capable of metabolic changes . The fact that it moves about marks it off distinctively from all other tissues . It is conspicuously kaleidoscopic in character , changing constantly in its intimate composition as it passes through the different parts of the body , for it is not only the common carrier to the various tissues of everything needful for their maintenance , but also the collector from the tissues of the products of metabolism . In the last analysis cells of every type in the animal body contribute something to the blood and receive something in return , so that the blood reflects the entire metabolism of the body . In spite of this fact , however , it is normally kept at nearly a constant level of component parts . When serious deviations occur , like the excessive loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells in anaemia or hemorrhage , pathological consequences are sure to follow . In general the following functions , at least , may be performed by the blood : A. EQUILIBRATION OF THE WATER CONTENT Water is not only a fluid that facilitates the internal transport of materials , making good losses by evaporation and otherwise , and preventing local drying up of tissues , but it is also the great solvent of various substances throughout the body . The degree of activity exhibited by any tissue is directly dependent upon the // fluidity of the cytoplasm within its cellular units , and this in turn is ultimately a matter of water supplied by the blood . B. LIBERATION OF ENERGY Tissues " burn " in the presence of oxygen , thus releasing energy . This release of energy is what constitutes " living . " Some tissues , like muscles , for example , lend themselves particularly to this process , while others , such as skeletal tissues , resemble more the iron girders of a fireproof building , and do . not burn as readily . The oxygen necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissues of vertebrates by the hemoglobin in the red corpuscles of the blood . C. DISTRIBUTION OF ' FOOD The blood is , from one point of view , a solution or emulsion of food substances carried in the plasma , or perhaps also to some extent as solid particles engulfed in the white blood cells . It is thus the grocery delivery boy for the cellular community . D. REGULATION OF TEMPERATURE Body temperature which results from the oxidation of the tissues , is equalized by means of the circulation of the blood , much as in a heating plant equipped with hot water pipes . Such equalization is necessary because of the unequal production of energy , in the form of heat , by different tissues of the body . In so-called " warm-blooded " animals the body temperature is maintained at a practically constant level , regardless of the temperature of the environment , thus enhancing the animal 's independence . In " cold-blooded " animals , an the other hand , owing partly to the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood , the temperature of the body fluctuates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is consequently a thermal slave to the environment in which it finds itself . It has been demonstrated , however , that even cold-blooded fishes when ill may show a feverlike temperature . E. TRANSMISSION OF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES Hormones , which are chemical messengers from the endocrine glands , perform metabolic feats frequently at some distance from their point of origin , traveling along the blood highways . Drugs and poisons introduced into the organism , likewise gain ready dispersal over the body through the blood . This is why a person // with malaria , for example , feels " sick all over , " since the blood carrying the organisms producing malarial poison literally goes over the whole body . F. DEFENSE AGAINST PARASITIC INVASION Troublesome foreign invaders , such as infective bacteria and protozoa , are regularly combated by the phagocytes of the blood which devour them . The cures of most diseases that are " caught , " depend upon the successful outcome of this function of the blood . G. DISPOSAL OF CELL WRECKAGE The blood is a perpetual funeral cortege , in which are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign bodies , bacterial products , and the wastes of metabolism generally . The manner of this elimination will be considered in Chapter XIV . H. CHEMICAL ELABORATION Furthermore , the blood is a peripatetic laboratory in which chemical transformations of wide variety are constantly going forward , as , for example , the formation of antitoxins of various sorts , or the production of glycogen from the blood in the liver . I. CHEMICAL DIAGNOSIS All the functions of the blood thus far indicated have to do with personal physiological benefits but blood may also be useful , outside the individual which elaborates it , in identifying disease . No other tissue gives so good a flashlight picture to the diagnostician of the present state of the varying metabolism of the body as the blood . The ease with which a sample may be obtained for examination without injury to the patient , and the readiness with which deviations from the normal are revealed therein , have resulted in an increasing dependence upon the blood as a means of clinical diagnosis . For example , in a doubtful case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood furnishes an immediate differential diagnosis , since in typhoid the number of white blood cells is below , while in appendicitis it is above normal . There is no doubt that dependence upon blood examination will become greater as technique is perfected and new approaches to the study of the blood are developed . 2 . Amount of Blood In adult man the amount of blood is about seven or eight per cent of the total weight , that is , about ten pounds or five quarts , // for a person weighing 130 pounds . In a newborn child the percentage of blood is less than in the adult , about five per cent of the total weight , while in lower vertebrates the relative amount of blood is also less than in mammals . Haempel gives the quantity of blood in fishes as less than two per cent of the total body weight . The blood supply is temporarily increased in those organs that are active as , for example , in the stomach immediately after eating , or the small intestine during digestion . As to specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figures have been given as 1.041 to 1.067. 3 . Erythrocytes Our sanguinary forebears were well acquainted with the appearance of blood , for the pages of history are copiously stained with it . Not until 1696 , however , about two centuries after Columbus had discovered America and his adventurous bones had returned to dust , did the Hollander , Anthony van Leeuwenhoek , find with his primitive lenses , that blood is " composed of exceeding small particles . " These he named " globules , " which he said " in most animals are of a red color , swimming in a liquor , called by physicians the serum , " and further that " by means of these globules the motion of the blood becomes visible , which otherwise would not be discoverable by the sight . " Red corpuscles are peculiar to vertebrates . The unquestionable first appearance of these characteristic globules in the evolutionary series is in cyclostomes . In amphioxus and larval eels they are wanting . Whenever invertebrates show red blood , as , for example , the blood clam , Arca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the midge Chironomus ) , the haemoglobin that produces the color is not located in red corpuscles for these are absent , but is found to be dissolved in the plasma . Red corpuscles , or erythrocytes , as they are technically known , are directly concerned with the respiratory function . The exchange of gases involved in respiration is accomplished , as has already been mentioned , by means of the chemical pigment hemoglobin , which is present inside of the corpuscles . Hemoglobin has the power both of temporarily loading up with oxygen , when it becomes o.ry-h t hemoglobin , and of readily releasing its load of oxygen , usually after transportation , wherever oxygen is absent . Haemoglobin is said to have the power of ab312 BIOLOGY OF VERTEBRATES sorbing seventy times as much oxygen as the plasma of the blood , which can carry oxygen only in solution . In man about one-third of each red corpuscle , or approximately fourteen per cent of the entire mass , is haemoglobin . The peculiar ability of this substance to carry the amount of oxygen necessary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gases , such as carbon monoxide , if encountered , for example , from the exhaust of a running automobile engine in a closed garage . When such an accident occurs recovery may follow if enough unaffected erythrocytes remain to maintain life until new corpuscles are elaborated or added by transfusion . The erythrocytes of most vertebrates are oval discs that appear to bulge in the center on account of the presence of a nucleus ( Fig. 266 ) . Among mammals erythrocytes are more circular in outline and , with a strange exception in the case of camels , the nucleus disappears , either by a process of absorption , extrusion , or budding , while the cell itself becomes a degenerate sac , or stroma capsule , having an internal structure very little understood , but containing a concentrated solution of haemoglobin . The original name " corpuscle , " ( small body ) therefore , fits the erythrocyte with more accuracy than the modern designation of " red blood cell . " In size the erythrocytes range tes rangre from seventyfive micra ' in the urodele Amphiuma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some other reported measurements of blood corpuscles are as follows : mud puppy , 58 p , ; turtle , 25 p ; lamprey , 15p ; eel , 15 p ; chick , 12p ; elephant , 9.4 p ; man , 7.5 ? . In general , the smaller corpuscles are , the more surface they expose for a given quantity of blood , and consequently the more effective they are in respiration . One of the factors determining the " cold-bloodedness " of the lower vertebrates as contrasted with mammals , is the larger relative size of their erythrocytes , and the smaller relative surface of exposure to oxygen . The number of erythrocytes in the blood is of considerable clinical importance . In man it is normally about 5,000,000 per cubic millimeter for the male , 4,500,000 for the somewhat less // metabolic female , while in the highly metabolic infant the count is greater than in either adult . The number in every case increases with a decrease of atmospheric pressure , as , for instance , in high altitudes . This is why patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lessened pressure of the rarefied air demands more surface exposure of haemoglobin to accomplish the normal amount of respiration , thus forcing the body to curative effort by producing more red corpuscles in compensation . The total number of red corpuscles in the average human being has been estimated at twenty-five billions , a number quite incomprehensible . Counting continuously at the rate of 200 per minute , it would take 250 years to complete the tally . This amazing figure may be visualized by stating that the total respiratory surface of the erythrocytes in a normal individual has been computed as equal to an area of approximately 3,000 square meters , a surface ample enough for laying out four regulation baseball diamonds side by side . Haemolysis , the wearing out or destruction of erythrocytes , is the inevitable outcome of their strenuous existence . The amount of coloring matter present in bile , which is due principally to the haemoglobin of broken-down erythrocytes , furnishes to the physiologist an index for estimating that the probable normal length of life for a single blood cell in man is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total number of twenty-five billion erythrocytes is approximately maintained throughout life , it becomes necessary that red blood be manufactured at an average rate of about 30 000 Cells per second . The process of the formation of red blood corpuscles is called hvmopoiesis . Before birth it is accomplished in the yolk sac and mesenchymatous tissues , and also in the liver and spleen . In later life , and particularly in mammals , haemopoietic tissue is mostly confined to bone marrow , where giant erythroblast cells maintain the incessant production of new erythrocytes ( Fig. 267 ) . // 4 . Leucocytes Intermingled with the red corpuscles in the blood are " white blood cells , " or leucocytes ( Fig. 268 ) . Unlike erythrocytes of mammals these are detached cells that not only retain their nuclei throughout life , but possess other characteristic features of true cells . Within the same organisms leucocytes show considerable differences with respect to the character of their nuclei , general size and shape , differences that make possible their classification into three general kinds , namely , lymphocytes , granulocytes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based upon the leucocytes of human blood which have been most studied . Lymphocytes constitute normally something like twenty-two to twenty-five per cent of all leucocytes . They are roughly spherical , with a single nucleus , and are smaller than erythrocytes , being from four to seven micra in diameter . Granulocytes , which are somewhat larger than lymphocytes , being from seven to ten micra in diameter , are characteristically ameboid in shape and behavior . They are often referred to as " polymorphonuclear leucocytes " from the fact that their nuclei generally assume a variety of shapes . The granular cytoplasm , which gives the name " granulocyte " to these cells , has differential staining properties that , according to Ehrlich , serve to classify them still further , into neutrophils , eosinophils , and basophils . The two latter kinds are comparatively rare , forming only about three per cent and five tenths per cent respectively of the total number of leucocytes , while neutrophils furnish in the neighborhood of seventy per cent . As these percentages vary to a considerable extent pathologically , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinician. // Monocytes are giant mononuclear leucocytes , twenty micra or more in diameter , constituting normally from two to ten per cent of all leucocytes . Dana and Carlson have pointed out that the number of new leucocytes contributed daily to the blood stream may he greater than the total number present in the blood . In man the total number of leucocytes of all kinds varies from 2,000 to 13,000 per cubic millimeter , with a normal average around 4,000 . The range of numerical variation is proportionately much greater than that of erythrocytes . There is a normal increase in the number of leucocytes , for instance , after eating or vigorous exercise , upon exposure to cold , and during pregnancy . When the number rises to over 10,000 , it indicates a pathological condition . With regard to their origin , different kinds of leucocytes may be produced , like erythrocytes , in different parts of the body . In mammals certain cells , myelocytes , within the hone marrow , that do not circulate , are no doubt the busiest factories for the manufacture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embryonic mesenchyme is also another source of origin for both kinds of blood cells . With regard to their renewal , however , leucocytes , unlike erythrocytes , have the power of increasing in number by fission wherever they collect in lymphoid tissue throughout the body . Such foci are called lymph nodes and lymph glands . The three kinds of leucocytes accomplish a variety of functions . For example , the wandering granulocytes , as well as monocytes , remove worn-out tissue cells and invading bacteria by engulfing and digesting them in true ameboid fashion , when they are known as phagocytes ; the lymphocytes in the lacteals , or lymphatic vessels that enmesh the intestine , transfer fat globules , emulsified in their cytoplasm ; while the giant monocytes have other though less known functions . The granulocytes , with their ameboid pseudopods , are able to creep against the blood stream when necessary along the inner walls of blood vessels , with an independent movement of their own , and are frequently found more numerous in the peripheral region of the channel within the blood vessels than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated along . Owing to their power of assuming a variety of shapes they are even able to squeeze between the irregular margins of the flat // endothelial cells forming the walls of the capillaries , ( Fig. 269 ) thus escaping entirely from the blood vessels into the interstices between the cells of tissues , in their phagocytic forays . Indeed there is hardly a nook or cranny in the body that can not be sought out and penetraced by these nomadic benefactors in the course of their sanitary and curative peregrinations . This escape through the capillary walls of phagocytes , or cell-devouring granulocytes , is termed diapedesis , and by its means some of the more important functions of the blood are accomplished . Once escaped , however , phagocytes must be returned to the blood stream , and this is accomplished by the lymphatic vessels . Meantime , the endothelial cells of the capillary walls immediately rempair their walls after being thus broken through , so that erythrocytes are kept within bounds . 5 . Thrombocytes In addition to erythrocytes and leucocytes there are present in vertebrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the blood of the frog these have been described as " spindle cells " ( Fig. 266 ) , which are intermediate in character between the red and white blood cells , and are perhaps able upon occasion to transform into either . Their unstable character is shown by the fact that they tend to mass together and dissolve as soon as blood is shed , which makes careful detailed observation of them difficult . Although true spindle cells have been found in certain fishes , amphibians , reptiles , and birds , they are not present in mammals . Their place in mammalian blood seems to be taken by small bodies which Bizzozero has named " blood platelets " ( Fig. 268 ) . The term " thrombocyte " ( thrombus , clot ; cyte , cell ) is not a very happy one to apply to blood platelets because these are not true cells at all , but probably small , non-nucleated fragments of cells , with slight ameboid motility . They do , however , have to do with forming the " thrombus , " or clot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The various kinds of thrombocytes vary in size from five-tenths must be returned to the blood stream , and this is accomplished by the lymphatic vessels . Meantime , the endothelial cells of the capillary walls immediately repair their walls after being thus broken through , so that erythrocytes are kept within bounds . // to four micra in diameter in man , thus being always considerably smaller than erythrocytes . In number they have been estimated to be from 200,000 to 778,000 per cubic millimeter , with 500,000 given by Howell for human blood . According to Wright , blood platelets have their origin in the giant erythroblast cells of bone marrow , from which they are constricted off . When withdrawn from blood vessels and exposed to air , blood platelets quickly change from rounded bodies into spindle and starlike shapes , and then disintegrate , making a prolonged technical study of them difficult . 6 . Plasma Two-thirds of blood is fluid plasma , which in turn is 80 per cent water . The plasma is a non-living fluid of probably more chemical complexity within the body than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing variety of substances in solution , chief among which are dissolved food materials on the way to cellular delivery , and waste products that are being collected for elimination . There are also present enzymes of various sorts which activate chemical changes ; opsonins , that prepare trespassing bacteria for phagocytosis ; hormones , the chemical messengers from endocrine glands on their way to the performance of tasks of internal regulation ; antitoxins , complement , amboceptors , and various other problematical substances engaged in constant warfare against harmful invasion ; finally , there is fibrinogen , which plays an important role in the clotting of blood . If it were not for the mechanism of the blood clot , loss of blood from wounds which open the blood vessels would prove to be much more serious than it is . According to Howell , a substance known as prothrombin is produced by the blood platelets when they disintegrate upon exposure to the air . Prothrombin in the presence of calcium salts in the blood forms thrombin , and this precipitates the fibrinogen in the blood to form a fibrin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clot . The clot thus formed acts as an emergency plug to prevent the escape of blood while organic repairs are being made . A blood clot that breaks free and circulates within the blood vessels until it meets obstruction , is termed an embolus . Such a blood clot caught in the capillaries of the brain may give rise to a " shock , " or apoplexy , recovery from which is dependent upon the removal of the embolus by absorption or other means . // III . BLOOD CHANNELS 1 . The Evolution of Organic Irrigation Blood channels may be looked upon as equivalent to the outer surface of the body , or as devices for increasing the surface area of the organism which is exposable to a nutritive and respiratory environment . In most invertebrates blood channels are largely lacunar or perivisceral spaces . The first evolutionary stages in the development of a circulatory apparatus are to be seen in the porous sponges , whose " blood , " i.e. , the surrounding water , carries a random charge of food and air past the loosely organized colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modus c also , there are neither true blood channels nor any specialized foodcarrying medium of blood , because in these lowly creatures the digestive tube itself branches out like the twigs of a tree , extending in between all the cells of the body in such a way as to effect a direct delivery of needful nutrition . Among vertebrates two general types of channels appear , namely , a h e nal system of closed tubes carrying blood , and an auxiliary lymphatic system carrying lymph . In general , blood channels form a system of irrigation consisting of a continuous series of cavities , lined throughout with flat endothelial cells , in which the blood circulates . The fact that blood is not subject to ebb and flow but is constantly in motion , and that it repeatedly makes the entire circuit of the blood vessels during life , was established in 1619 by William Harvey ( 1578-1657 ) , long before anyone actually saw the blood pass through the smaller connective channels . In 1696 Leeuwenhoek described the capillary circulation in a bat 's wing , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artery and a vein placed close beside each other and of a size large enough to admit the passage of ten or twelve globules at the same time ; and in this artery the blood was protruded or driven forward with great swiftness , and flowed back through the vein , which was a most pleasing spectacle to behold . " Although the circulatory system penetrates to nearly every part of the living organism , there are a few regions of the highly differentiated vertebrate body that are not invaded by blood vessels of any kind , namely , the cornea of the eye , cartilage tissue , and the epidermis together with its derivatives , the hair , nails , feathers , horns , and claws . // 2 . General Plans of Circulation Blood vessels are related to each other in the following order : Figure Four general plans may be indicated , viz. , annelid , amphioxus , fish , mammal . A. ANNELID PLAN Two longitudinal blood vessels , one dorsal and one ventral , connected at either end by capillary networks , make up the circulatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward along the dorsal vessel and backward through the ventral vessel in the simplest manner ( Fig. 270 ) . B. Amphioxus PLAN Amphioxus , the lowest vertebrate , bears a general resemblance to the invertebrate annelids in its circulatory system which has , however , two notable differences . First , the blood flows around , in the opposite direction from that of the annelid plan , and second , there is introduced along the course of the ventral vessel , before even the semblance of a heart appears , an extra capillary network // that spreads over the diverticulum of the gut ( the ancestral liver ) , forming a primitive hepatic portal system ( Fig. 270 ) . Moreover , in common with other lower vertebrates , a large part of its anterior capillary system passes through the gills , which extend along half the digestive tube . Most of the posterior capillaries enwrap the remainder of the digestive tube together with its liver diverticulum . Thus , the two major functions of the blood , namely , respiration and nutrition , are localized by the arrangement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan becomes further elaborated in fishes ( Fig. 271 ) , by the development of a heart , and the introduction of an additional capillary complex involving the kidneys , called the renal portal system . The heart is simply an enlargement and modification of a- part of the main ventral blood vessel lying between the hepatic portal capillaries and the gills , whereby the tube becomes constricted into four tandem chambers through which the blood flows forward . The renal portal system ( Fig. 280 , A ) is a special device for the return of blood from the region of the large propeller-like tail , characteristic of fishes , through a capillary network in the kidneys , thence joining the main blood stream secondarily . It is not shown in Fig. 271 . In fishes , therefore , besides the capillaries which unite the outward distributing system of blood vessels ( arteries ) with the inward collecting system ( veins ) there are two notable strainerlike complexes of capillaries , or portal systems , within the kidneys and liver respectively , that interrupt the stream of blood returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan of the circulation among higher vertebrates when reduced to the simplest terms , may be represented by the diagram in Fig. 272 . The dotted line , which is connected at only one end with the circulatory system , stands for the auxilINTERNAL // iary lymphatic system . This collects lymph that has escaped from the capillaries from all regions of the body , returning it to the venous system just before it reaches the heart . It will be seen that the methods of respiration and locomotion both have to do with modifying the circulatory plan . The change from branchial respiration by means of gills to pulmonary respiration through lungs , makes necessary a double blood circuit instead of a single one , as in fishes , with two central clearing houses , or hearts , which are placed so intimately together that , looked at superficially , they have the appearance of one , Figure while the renal portal system becomes discontinued with the diminishing importance of the tail and the evolution of locomotion on land by means of legs . 3 . Structure of Blood Vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to distinguish arteries , veins , capillaries , and lymphatics from each other . Arteries and veins of the same size are not to be confused since veins have thinner walls and a larger cavity within , and consequently are more liable to collapse when emptied of blood . heart // Both arteries and veins present three layers of tissue ( Fig. 273 ) , known as tunica intima , tunica media , . and tunica adventitia . The inside layer , or tunica intima , is invariably made up of a lining of fiat endothelium , continuous and universal in all blood vessels including the heart itself , and wrapped about by reinforcing connective tissue and elastic fibers . The middle layer , or tunica media. , is largely smooth muscle cells , mostly arranged in circular fashion and interspersed with connective and elastic tissue ; while the outer layer , or tunica adventitia , is principally connective and elastic tissue , penetrated by lymphatics , and vasomotor nerve fibers , which control the changing calibre of the blood vessel . Certain veins in man , such as the umbilical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are noteworthy because longitudinal muscle fibers also are found in their outside layer . Arteries are thick-walled conduits carrying blood away from the heart , which are characterized by a well-developed contractile tunica media , that maintains the shape of the blood vessel without collapse , and a relatively thin tunica adventitia . As they follow their course throughout the body they decrease in size , passing over into arterioles , arterial capillaries , and eventually true capillaries . These form innumerable anastomoses between the arterial capillaries on the one side and the venous capillaries on the other . True capillaries lack both tunica media and tunica adventitia , having for a wall only the single innermost layer of flat endothelial cells from the tunica intima . Arterial and venous capillaries , therefore , are transitional in size and thickness between the capillaries proper and the arterioles and venules respectively . Veins , which always begin with capillaries , are relatively thinwalled and collapsible . Since their walls are deficient in the elastic tissue and muscle cells of the tunica media , the tunica adventitia becomes the most highly developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the backsetting of the blood ( Fig. 274 ) , are present in many veins but not in arteries , except in the immediate neighborhood of the heart of some gill-breathers. // Valves are absent from the veins of the brain , cord , meninges , bone , and the umbilical vein , as well as most visceral veins , except branches of the hepatic portal system . The thin-walled veins are much more likely to anastomose , become varicose , or to enlarge into sinuses , than the thick-walled arteries . Lymphatics are typically varicose as well as capable of great distension . Ordinarily they do not acquire thick muscular or elastic walls and are very collapsible , although the larger lymphatics develop a definite tunica media with muscle cells , and may even pulsate . They entwine around other blood vessels in the most intimate fashion , yet do not communicate with them except at one or two definite places near the heart . Lymph capillaries , although never so small as haemal capillaries , have the same sort of thin endothelial walls . Physiologically , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body cavity , and the pericardial and pleural cavities , as well as the synovial spaces around joints , belong to the lymphatic system , although their walls have a somewhat different origin and structure from those of ordinary lymphatic vessels . Lymphatics , like veins , possess valves along their course , which are crescentic folds of the tunica intima , preventing to any great extent the retreat of the fluid away from the heart . 4 . The Role of the Capillaries The first blood vessels to form embryologically are capillaries ( capilla , little hair ) . Physiologically they are the most important part of the intricate system of blood channels in the vertebrate body , because it is in them that the final business of the circulatory system is accomplished . As has been said , both arteries and veins have their origin in capillaries , extending from their source by terminal growth . If the entire circulatory system be compared to a railroad system , // capillaries correspond to stations where passengers and freight are entrained and detrained , while the more conspicuous arteries and veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always been more concerned with tracing and homologizing veins and arteries which it is possible to identify , than with capillaries , that , by reason of their complexity and numbers , defy cataloguing . When one considers Krogh 's estimate , that there may be at least 2,000 different capillaries in a square millimeter of human muscle , and that the total length of the capillaries of the body , if placed end to end , would be as much as 100,000 kilometers , or two and one-half times around the earth , it is small wonder that anatomists are forced to describe them in the most general terms . Unlike the twigs of a tree they extend without diminution in calibre , as a result of which there is usually more total internal passage-way in the anastomosing network of capillaries than in the larger blood vessels which they immediately connect ( Fig. 275 ) . In places they are so small that the blood corpuscles have to change shape in order to squeeze through in single file ( Fig. 276 ) . Sometimes they abruptly interrupt the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retia mirabilia . Such networks are found in the chorioid layer of the eyeball ; in the " pseudobranchs " on the walls of the spiracular clefts in elasmobranchs ; in the " red gland " within the swim bladder of fishes ; and in the glomeruli of kidneys . Capillaries are generally interINTERNAL // mediaries between veins and arteries , but they may connect veins and veins , when they constitute a " portal system , " or arteries and arteries , as in the gills of fishes . 5 . Arteries and Their Transformations Arteries , as already indicated , are blood vessels leading , in the physiological sense , away from the heart and ending in capillaries . The course which the arteries follow in their task of distributing a proper blood supply throughout the body is best understood by considering it as divided into posterior and anterior sections with reference to the location of the heart . Of the two sections the posterior one is much the simpler with reference to the modifications that it undergoes in the vertebrate series , and it will be unnecessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that bear the brunt of the transformation from water to land life , require some description . In fishes one main trunk line ( Fig. 277 , B ) , the ventral aorta , leaves the heart and passes forward , embedded in muscles and connective tissue . It soon branches on either side into paired afferent branchial arteries which go to the gills , there losing their identity in a maze of capillaries , only to emerge on the dorsal side as paired efferent branchial arteries , which unite to form a large single dorsal aorta . From the main trunk line of this dorsal aorta , branches are given off that supply all the organs and regions of the body . In the higher vertebrates which have lost their gills and acquired a double heart , the dorsal aorta arises from the heart on the left side , and without suffering any interruption of gill capillaries , proceeds directly , after making a horseshoe loop , to supply all parts of the body . Meanwhile another arterial trunk line , the pulmonary artery , leaves the heart on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the entire vertebrate series the fate of all the arteries that arise from the dorsal aorta , when once it loops around to pass backward within the body cavity , is much the same , in that all organs and regions of the body receive branches of adequate size in due order . Therefore the comparative anatomist does not have important differences to record in the various classes of vertebrates . The more ignifi.cant transformations of the arterial system are centered about the gill arches and their remains . An examination of this part of the arterial system in different vertebrates is , therefore , profitable . // In amphioxus the ventral aorta is connected with the , dorsal aorta by a number of pairs of lateral branchial loops that encircle Figure the anterior part of the digestive tube and supply the gill capillaries . These loops increase in number with age and may become ? // as many as sixty pairs in the adult animal , occupying a large portion of the anterior region of the body . In other vertebrates the number of pairs of bronchial loops present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much modification occurs in different vertebrates . The primitive embryonic arrangement of these arterial vessels is indicated in Fig. 277 , A. It will be seen that the loops do not connect directly with the dorsal aorta , but with two smaller blood vessels , the radices aorta , which secondarily join in the form of the letter Y , to make the dorsal aorta . The fate in the vertebrate series of these six pairs of embryonic loops , gives one the essential modifications in the comparative anatomy of the arterial system , for , as already mentioned , the distribution of the blood supply from the trunk line of the dorsal aorta over the body does not present fundamental differences in the various vertebrate classes . In teleost fishes ( Fig. 277 , I3 ) , the two most anterior pairs of loops , namely , the mandibular ( I ) and the hyoid ( II ) , are suppressed in adult life , while the remaining four ( III , IV , V , VI ) become the bronchial arches , interrupted by gill capillaries . The anterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a similar extension of the radieae aortae , the external carotid arteries . These arteries supply the head region . Passing to the Amphibia the plan of the arterial arches in the gill-breathing urodeles ( Fig. 277 , C ) may be understood when it is projected against the background of the primitive embryonic type . The external gills of amphibians , unlike the internal gills of fishes , do not directly interrupt the bronchial loops , but are established on a detour , so that it is possible for the blood to pass from the ventral to the dorsal aorta by two routes , one through the uninterrupted bronchial loop , and the other by the way of a side line through the capillaries of the external gills . Three pairs of such external gills may be present in urodeles , on loops IV , V , and VI . Thus it is possible in those salamanders that discard their gills during metamorphosis , for the blood to continue without interruption by way of the bronchial loops direct , avoiding the disastrous consequences which would inevitably result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be put out of commission . // In urodeles , it should be noted , the last posterior loop ( VI ) becomes for the most part diverted as the pulmonary artery , to go to the lungs instead of to the dorsal aorta , while the radio e aorta ; between loops III and IV become much attenuated . The anuran amphibians , exemplified by the frog ( Fig. 278 ) , pass through a tadpole stage in which their arteries resemble those of the urodeles , but go a step further in discarding ancestral arterial pathways , since only three pairs ( III , IV , and VI ) of the six embryonic loops , survive in the adult . Loop IV becomes the large aortic arch , while loop III is entirely devoted to supplying the head region , as the connectives between III and IV on the radices aortas disappear , so that blood in the third loop can no // loner pass directly into the dorsal aorta . That part of loop VI which does not go into the formation of the pulmonary artery is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named the ductus arteriosus ( " ductus Botalli " ) , through which no blood passes . Loop V , that showed signs of degeneration in the perennibranchiate urodeles , disappears entirely in the adult frog . The same three pairs of loops survive in the reptiles ( Fig. 277 , D ) . There is , however , one distinct difference with regard to the aortic arch ( IV ) . This arch on its left side becomes split off from the rest of the ventral aorta , and carries a different quality of blood to the dorsal aorta from that borne in the right side , since it connects with a newly established chamber of the heart . In amphibians the mixture of aerated and non-aerated blood occurs in the heart before it is sent over the body , but in reptiles , which have more complete partitions established between the chambers of the heart , the mixing of " pure " with " impure " blood is postponed until the right and left branches of loop IV pour their diverse contributions into the dorsal aorta . Reptiles as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Birds ( Fig. 279 , A ) and mammals ( Fig. 279 , B ) , show a still greater reduction of arterial byways , since in each case one-half // of the pair of aortic loops is suppressed . The right half remains in birds , the left half in mammals . The single large aortic loop that arises from the heart in man , arches over to the left and passes downward to supply the body and its various organs , thus becoming the transformed product of the embryonic ventral aorta , the left side of the fourth branchial loop , and the dorsal aorta . Occasional rare cases reported in medical literature of double aortic arches in man , find a ready interpretation in the light of comparative anatomy . In man too there is a single ductus Botalli on the left side as a part of the sixth embryonic loop , and this remains open for the passage of blood ( luring uterine life , until at birth pulmonary respiration is established . 6 . Evolution of the Venous Routes The channels by means of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergone a greater degree of evolutionary adaptation in the vertebrate series , than the corresponding arteries that distribute the blood from the heart over the body . This is due in part to the elaborate complexes of capillaries inserted in the course of the veins , which form the " portal " systems , and in part to the accessory services of the lymphatic system of channels . As would be expected the least complicated arrangement of veins is found in amphioxus . An unpaired caudal vein picks up blood from the postanal region of the body and , making a loop around the anus , continues forward beneath the intestine as the subintestinal vein , receiving contributions from the capillaries that encircle the alimentary canal , and deriving food therefrom . Near its anterior end the subintestinal vein breaks up into a primitive hepatic portal system as it reaches the liver diverticulum , while a blood vessel , out of which the heart and ventral aorta are destined to evolve later in the fishes , goes forward from the liver to the gills . The venous system of an elasmobranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen that the heart not only receives blood that has been strained through the liver from the hepatic veins of the hepatic portal system , but that there are also on either side anterior cardinal and inferior jugular veins bringing back blood from the dorsal and ventral regions respectively , of the head , while postcardinal and lateral veins do a similar service for the body in general . All these veins converge to form // on either side a common channel , the duct of Cuvier , that opens directly into the heart . The subclavian veins from the pectoral fins , or " arms , " empty also near this point of convergenNs . The iliac veins from the pelvic fins , or posterior paired appendages , are contributory branches to the lateral veins which run along the body wall , either to empty independently into the ducts of Cuvier or indirectly after joining the postcardinals. // The caudal vein , ordinarily draining a large area in the fishes , forks like a letter Y at the anus and sends a diminishing branch along the outer margin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capillaries within the kidneys , emerging eventually into the postcardinals , thus forming the renal portal system . It will be seen that there are , therefore , three venous systems combined in the elasmobranch fishes , namely , the cardinal system , including tributaries draining the head and body wall with various organs in the body cavity ; the hepatic portal system , from the digestive tube ; and the renal portal system , from the large tail region and the kidneys . In many elasmobranch fishes also there is still to be seen along the ventral wall of the digestive tube in intimate relation with the spiral valve within , a subintestinal vein like that of amphioxus . This is the anterior continuation of the caudal vein , but instead of forming the main trunk line and passing directly to the liver to form the hepatic portal network , as in amphioxus , it empties first , during embryonic life , into one of the two large temporary vitelline veins that firing the blood from the yolk sac . In the higher vertebrates the omphalomesenteric veins , thus formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , break up to form the hepatic portal complex within the liver . In the larger group of bony fishes ( teleosts ) the venous arrangement is much like that of the cartilaginous elasmobranchs , except that the lateral veins disappear , and the traffic from the body wall and pelvic fins , formerly handled by the lateral veins , is taken over by the postcardinals . Salamanders and frogs , as representative amphibians , present two further stages in the evolution of the veins of vertebrates which can be understood by comparison with the more primitive arrangement already described in elasmobranch fishes . The plan of the principal veins in salamanders , as shown diagrammatically in Fig. 280 , B , presents three striking innovations . First , the appearance of a new vein should be noted , the postcava , which rivals the postcardinals in collecting blood from the posterior part of the body . This important blood channel fuses with the right postcardinal in the region near the kidneys , and extends forward through the liver to the heart , as a single vein . Although like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respect , it is not homologous with that vein , being dorsal to the intestine and lying close to the aorta along the body wall , while the subintestinal vein is ventral to the intestine and quite independent of the body wall . Secondly , the iliac veins , instead of opening into the lateral veins as in elasmobranchs , fork on either side , sending one branch to the renal portal system at the kidneys , while the other branch , which is homologous with the lateral veins of the elasmobranchs , unites with its fellow on the other side to form a median abdominal vein that empties anteriorly into the hepatic portal system . Blood returning from the hind legs of an amphibian , therefore , must pass through either the renal portal , or the hepatic portal strainer before reaching the heart , whereas in fishes the iliac blood goes direct to the heart by way of the lateral veins without portal interference of any kind . Thirdly , amphibians , since they use the skin to a considerable extent as a supplementary breathing organ , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of well developed cutaneous veins . Diagrammatically these bear a superficial resemblance to the lateral veins of elasmobranchs but should not be confused with then . The arrangement of the veins in the frog embryo , or " tadpole , " is like that of a salamander , except that the rivalry between the newly established postcava and the diminishing postcardinals , culminates in the successful monopoly of the circulatory blood traffic by the former and the disappearance of the latter ( Fig. 280 , C ) . With the elimination of the postcardinals , the anterior cardinals become continuous with the ducts of Cuvier , forming the precavas , which in turn are continuous with the jugular veins that now return blood from the head directly into the right auricle of the heart . Moreover , with the loss of the tail the caudal vein vanishes , and in consequence the " portal , " or carrying , part of the renal portal system , is transferred entirely to the iliac veins . Such drastic changes as these , designed to meet the difficult conditions accompanying the precarious transitional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeshifts which this small struggling group of vertebrates has had to resort to in order to accomplish the great evolutionary feat of emerging from water to land . As a matter of convenience , reptiles and birds have been put // together by Huxley and called the sauropsida , since they have many anatomical features in common which distinguish them from fishes and amphibians ( Icldhyopsida ) on the one hand and mammals on the other . While both the sauropsida and the mammals are based on the preceding plan of the ichthyopsida , they have undergone somewhat divergent modification with respect to the routes of the veins , so that the sauropsida represent more properly a side relationship to the mammals , like that of cousins rather than of ancestors in the direct line . The anterior part of the postcardinal atrophies , and a pair of longitudinal vertebral veins ( Fig. 280 , D ) , formed out of anastomoses of branches of the intersegmental veins , come into prominence , annexing themselves to the anterior cardinals before emptying into the ducts of Cuvier . Posteriorly the vertebral veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transverse intercostal veins . The renal portal system , the fate of which is intimately bound up with the mesonephric excretory apparatus , although persisting in reptiles , becomes extremely reduced in birds , and disappears entirely in mammals , along with the replacement of the mesonephric system by the metanephric plan of excretory organs , that is , the " permanent kidneys . " The abdominal vein of amphibians and reptiles , comparable to the lateral veins of fishes , merges into an epigastric vein in birds ( Fig. 281 , A ) , which is possibly homologous with the umbilical vein of mammals . In lizards , snakes and turtles , as pointed out by H. L. Bruner , ' the venous system in the head region is characterized by an abundance of sinuses , or blood-filled enlargements of the veins , both inside and outside of the cranium . These modifications of the head veins are much less in evidence in the Crocodilia than in the three lower groups of reptiles just mentioned . Through a modification of the blood pressure in the superficial sinuses that extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ecdysis ) of the corneal layer is accomplished . Recourse to some such device is necessary in the case of these reptiles because they are enveloped in thick dry scaly skins which do not easily allow for the necessary periodical casting off of the dead , inelastic outside part of the integument. // In Phrynosoma , the " horned toad " of the cactus regions of southwestern ? nited States , the venous sinuses , together with associated muscles , form a curious mechanism whereby these grotesque animals , under excitement , are able to squirt blood from their eyes . Among mammals ( Fig. 281 , B ) , the persisting anterior ends of the postcardinals , together with the supracardinals which are formed in their neighborhood , become the azygos system . The stub of the right postcardinal , with the supracardinal on the same side , forms the azygos vent , while a fragment of the left postcardinal and the left supracardinal , join as the hemiazygos vein , which is connected by anastomosing bridges to the azygos vein . In marsupials , rodents , insectivores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed on the two sides , while in the head region two precavas , in balanced fashion , return blood to the heart . In carnivores , edentates , and primates , on the other hand , a reduction of the left azygos system results in an asymmetrical shifting of most of the blood of this area to the right side for delivery to the heart , while in the head region the right precava becomes dominant and the left precava degenerates into a pensioner in the form of the insignificant oblique vein of the left atrium . The blood on the left side of the head is now // delivered to the right side through the left innominate vein which connects the two jugular veins as the left precava atrophies . Out of the remains of the left precava and the duct of Cuvier from which it arose , there persists the great cardiac vein which returns blood from the walls of the heart itself to the right auricle . Not only the heart but all of the larger blood vessels , arteries , veins , and lymphatics , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ramifying system of nutrient blood vessels , called visa vasorum , or " vessels of the vessels , " for , just as " shoemaker 's children must have shoes , " so the blood vessels themselves need to be provided with a circulatory mechanism for their own welfare . There are also developed in the venous system of mammals a pair of subcardinal veins , parallel and ventral to the embryonic and ancestral postcardinals , which take part in the formation of the venous complex that drains the posterior part of the body . 7 . Lymphatics The lymphatic system , consisting of channels and spaces containing lymph , is anatomically and physiologically distinct from , but less conspicuous than , the more easily seen haemal system of arteries , veins , and capillaries through which the blood courses . A. LYMPH Lymph resembles blood in being a fluid containing detached cells , bearing the kaleidoscopic products of metabolism . It lacks respiratory red blood corpuscles , however , and blood platelets . All of its cellular elements are leucocytes , which having escaped by the process of diapedesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere into the minute interstices of the tissues , are eventually rescued by the lymphatic vessels and returned to the red blood stream . Although lymph contains less fibrinogen than blood , it nevertheless retains the capacity to form a clot . B. LYMPH CHANNELS The lymphatic channels form an anastomosing network of conduits throughout the connective tissues of the body , in intimate association with arteries and veins which they probably equal if not exceed in total carrying capacity ( Fig. 282 ) . In size the lymphatic channels range from minute varicose capillaries to // large sinuses , or lymph reservoirs , such as the subcutaneous sacs 1 under the skin of the frog ( Fig. 283 ) , which protect the delicate skin from excessive loss of moisture during the temporary excursions of this amphibian from water to land . The body cavity of invertebrates con-tains lymphlike blood , and is an essential part of the lymphatic system that in the lower forms assumes primary importance over that of the red blood system from which it is not completely differentiated . In vertebrates the major cavities also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as the meningeal spaces about the nerve cord and brain , the synovial areas around joints , and the peri- and endolymphatic passage-ways of the inner ear , are all directly or indirectly a part of the lymphatic " underworld . " Although the lymphatic channels are everywhere in most intimate contact with the blood vessels , they do not open directly into the blood system except at one or two definite places near the heart . The flow of the lymph is accomplished in some small degree by gravity , but its advance is principally brought about by muscular movements of the exercising body , by means of which it is squeezed along its oneway course towards the heart . Since the lymphatic channels // are not connected with the red blood system at their distal ends , the pumping power of the heart can have no effect upon lymph movement , as it does upon the blood within the red blood system of channels of which the heart is an integral part . Unlike the blood , lymph always travels towards the heart , backsliding being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These valves are particularly noticeable in birds and mammals . C. LYMPH HEARTS In the lower vertebrates certain of the lymphatic vessels , which are near the junction of the lymphatic system with the veins , may acquire muscular walls and become pulsating lymph hearts , thus supplementing by their contraction the body muscles in affecting the movement of the lymph . Among amphibians , eaeilians ( Apoda ) have a pair of pulsating lymph hearts for each of the numerous segments of their long wormlike bodies , while urodeles likewise possess a double row of several peripheral lymph hearts , situated along the posterior part of the lateral line on either side . Frogs , and other anurans , have typically four lymph hearts in adult life , placed , with reference to the four legs ( Fig. 284 ) , anteriorly at the level of the third vertebra near the junction of the subclavian vein with the jugular vein , and posteriorly at the base of the iliac veins on either side of the end of the urostyle . In reptiles , only the posterior pair of lymph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even these vanish after a reminiscent embryonic appearance . D. THORACIC DUCT The largest of the lymph vessels , into which all the others . converge , opens into the venous system near the heart . This is the subvertebral space in fishes , which becomes a pair of thoracic duets ' in reptiles , so called from their subvertebral position in the , // thorax . In mammals , although embryologically paired , usually only the left thoracic duct persists , and this empties into the left brachiocephalic vein , when that vein is present , just before it reaches the right auricle of the heart . E. LYMPH NODES AND ORGANS In addition to the lymphatic channels and their modifications in the form of enlarged sinuses and pulsating hearts , there are present throughout the lymphatic system numerous lymph nodes particularly in mammals , as well as certain localized organs and tissues of a predominately lymphatic character , such as the spleen , bone marrow , the " fat bodies " of hibernating animals , the tonsils , and Peyer 's patches in the small intestine . Lymph nodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , encapsuled in a tangle of reticular connective tissue , crowded with leucocytes , and supplied with afferent and efferent lymphatic capillaries . In these substations not only the filtering of lymph is accomplished , but also leucocytes here undergo both dissolution and renewal by mitosis . The total aggregate of lymphoid tissue in the body is very great . It is present , for example on the floor and roof of the amphibian mouth , and in mammals becomes specialized into the tonsilar ring , made up of palatine , lingual , and pharyngeal or " adenoid " elements which guard the gateway of the alimentary and respiratory tracts against bacterial invasion . Peyer 's patches in the lining of the intestine are also lymphoid areas which perform a similar protective service as " intestinal tonsils . " The thymus glands of mammals , after having sowed their possible endocrinal " wild oats " during the period of body growth , reform and join the numerous company of lymphatic organs . The largest and most constant of the lymphatic organs is the spleen that lies encapsuled in the body cavity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average weight of seven ounces , is not only a center for the filterage and rejuvenescence of leucocytes , but of erythrocytes as well . Accessory spleens , or haemolymph nodes , varying in size from a millet seed to a pea , are distributed in the connective tissues at various places throughout the body . // IV . THE HEART The heart is essentially a modified blood vessel in which the tunica media , here a peculiar kind of muscle tissue different from that found anywhere else in the body , plays the principal role . While cormpressing muscular movements of the body are largely responsible for the propulsion of lymph through the lymphatic channels , the heart is the indispensable pump by means of which the circulation of the blood is accomplished . Amphioxus , in which the circulatory apparatus is so primitive that neither red blood corpuscles nor an accessory lymphatic system are present , has no heart at all , but the ventral blood vessel that extends between EE liver and the gills , is contractile enough to propel the blood forward . It is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future vertebrate heart . From such a beginning the vertebrate heart passes through a series of modifications of increasing complexity , until eventually there is evolved the four chambered mammalian heart . Any heart consists of two kinds of chambers , a thin-walled receiving chamber where the returning blood collects , and a thick-walh 'd , muscular forwarding chamber , separated from the former by valves , which prevent the retreat of the blood when the muscular walls contract ( Fig. 285 ) . // The mammalian heart is double in three respects , namely : anatomically , in that it is structurally two ventricle-auricle systems together ; physiologically , in that two different pumps are involved , that is , one for the distribution of the blood to the lungs for aeration , and the other , over the body for general utilization ( Fig. 272 ) ; and embryologically , since the heart arises , as will be pointed out later , from the union of two vitelline veins ( Fig. 286 ) . 1 . Venous Hearts The relatively small heart of fishes , consists typically of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or non-aerated blood passes , since the spentc blood , sent forward from the heart to the gills for aeration , must make the grand tour of the body , and become again non-aerated , before it is returned to its starting point in the heart . Beginning posteriorly , the four chambers in the heart of fishes , are the sinus venosus , atrium , ventricle , and conus arteriosus ( Fig. 287 ) . The first two belong to the re-ceiving region of the heart and are reservoirs with elastic rather than muscular walls . The ventricle and the conus arteriosus , on the other hand , are thick-walled and muscular , and constitute the forwarding pump for the blood . In cyclostomes the four chambers are arranged in tandem fashion , but as the heart becomes relatively larger in higher fishes it kinks up , thus losing its primitive straightness and growing more compact , with some of the chambers superimposed over others . Eventually in the vertebrate series ( Fig. 288 ) , the sinus venosus is incorporated with the atrium to form the auricle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The conus arteriosus , or that part of the heart beyond the ventricle but still within the pericardial chamber , undergoes various modifications among the lower vertebrates before its identity is finally swallowed up by the ventricle . In elasmobranch and ganoid fishes , as well as in Dipnoi , its proximal end is supplied with valves while its distal end becomes differentiated into the thin-walled bulbsus arteriosus . The conus is spirally // twisted in the Dipnoi , as if the process of incorporation with the ventricle had already begun . Among teleost fishes and the amphibians , the conus assumes a lesser role and a more distal enlargement termed the bulbus arteriosus , takes its place . The walls of the bulbus arteriosus are elastic and may have to do with regulating the back pressure of the blood as it is forced into the near-by capillaries of the gills . 2 . Transitional Hearts With the introduction of lungs there is initiated a new and shorter circuit , whereby aerated blood is returned directly to the heart before making the excursion of the body . The pulmonary blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a partition having developed which divides the original receiving chamber into two . Thus , in the Dipnoi and amphibians , which accomplish the precarious transfer from gills to lungs , there is developed what may be regarded as a heart and a half , or a heart with two atria or auricles and one ventricle . The auricular partition is incomplete in the Dipnoi , so that a mixture of aerated and non-aerated blood results within the auricles of the heart through the so-called foramen ouile . In amphibians , although the auricular partition is complete , the blood becomes mixed somewhat in the common cavity of the ventricle . When sent over the body without having been revivified by a trip to the source of oxygen in the lungs , there results something comparable to burning " slag " instead of coal , which is one of the reasons why these animals are " cold-blooded. " // This handicap of mixed blood within the ventricle of the amphibian heart is partially avoided by the spongy reticular structure of the ventricular chamber , as well as by the rapidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thorough mixing of the two kinds of auricular blood entering at different sides of the ventricle . Therefore , every time the ventricle is filled , the mass of blood may be thought of as momentarily of three kinds , arranged in a sort of temporary stratification , with venous blood from the left auricle placed nearest the exit of the ventricle ( Fig. 278 ) , the aerated blood from the lungs farthest away from this exit , and the inevitable mixture of these two somewhere in between . As the ventricle expels the blood before these relations have either time or opportunity to change , the result is that the non-aerated blood nearest the exit fills the first possible avenues of escape after leaving the heart , which are the pulmonary arteries leading to the lungs ( the Vlth embryonic arterial loop , Fig. 277 , C ) . The intermediate mixed blood , unable to enter the already filled pulmonary arteries , is forced along into the next available blood vessels , which are the aortic loops ( IVth embryonic arterial loops ) distributing blood generally over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bottom of the ventricle , being the last to emerge and finding all other passage-ways crowded full , passes on to the carotid arteries ( IIIrd embryonic arterial loops ) that supply the brain . Thus the brain , that always needs the best available aerated blood , is in the way of obtaining it , even in such unintellectual ancestors as frogs and toads . The transition from a single to a double heart is further shown by the reptiles ( Fig. 289 ) , which have come to forsake entirely the gill method of respiration , but , with the exception of the Crocodilia , have not yet arrived at the estate of a complete double // heart . Among reptiles a partition forms in the ventricle that tends to keep separate the aerated blood returning from the lungs by way of the left auricle to the left side of the ventricle , from the venous blood of the body entering the right side from the right auricle . This partition is incomplete in most reptiles , so that there still exists some degree of mixture between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fig. 290 ) . Non-aerated blood from the right ventricle goes out not only to the lungs but also through the right aortic loop where it joins the aerated blood from the left aortic loop that has come from the left ventricle , to form the dorsal aorta , or the main distributing trunk of the body . The result is that in reptiles , although the blood is kept unmixed as far as the dorsal aorta , there is still mixed blood being distributed over the body with a corresponding inevitable sluggishness of behavior. 3 . Double Hearts In the Crocodilia the foramen of Panizzae becomes finally obliterated and two complete hearts , superficially incorporated into one , are established . One of these hearts is made up of the more powerful left ventricle with the right auricle , and constitutes the forwarding and receiving apparatus for the major circuit over // the body , while the other is the smaller . right ventricle with the left auricle that takes care of the minor respiratory circuit of oxygen supply to and from the lungs . Aerated and non-aerated blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also in reptiles when the aortic loops join to form the dorsal aorta , is kept separate among birds and mammals as far away from the heart as possible , until the capillaries are reached . The heart of a bird is proportionately larger than that of any other vertebrate , for an especially efficient pump is required to keep the aerial machinery of these strenuous animals going . Among mammals also small forms have relatively larger hearts than large forms . Moreover , in the same animal the proportionate size of the heart decreases with the relative decrease of heatdispensing body surface that accompanies growth . For example , the weight of a newlyborn rabbit 's heart has been found to be 5.9 per cent of the total weight , while that of an adult rabbit is 2.8 per cent . The position of the vertebrate heart is always ventral to the digestive tube , and in gill-breathing vertebrates is far anterior When the head of a fish or a salamander is cut off , the heart is usually included with it . In higher vertebrates as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until in such long-necked forms as . swans and giraffes it comes to lie a long distance from its ancestral location and is much more centralized with reference to the body . To have " the heart in the mouth " is , therefore , a sort of ancestral sensation that should not disquiet a comparative anatomist . The human heart is popularly located by tragic actors and sentimental lovers on the left side , because the throbbing point of the coneshaped ventricular part normally projects from behind the ster346 BIOLOGY OF VERTEBRATES num toward the left side where it is most readily felt . It is in reality median in position ( Fig. 291 ) . The adult human heart weighs not far from ten ounces , and is approximately the size of the clenched fist . In shape it is never " heart-shaped , " according to the dictates of popular fancy , but a flattened cone . There have been many other popular misconceptions associated with the human heart from time immemorial , such as " a good man out of the treasure of his heart bringeth forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked . " It would be just as appropriate , although less glamorous , for lovers who now pledge their hearts to each other , to pledge their livers instead , but the heart has been so long regarded as the citadel of motives and affections that the vocabulary of romance would be bereft without it . 4 . The Work of the Heart In order to accomplish its mission , blood must be kept in constant motion . That this is done is shown by the familiar fact that from any wound , however slight , which makes a break in the circulatory channels , the blood immediately flows out . In amphioxus , and in certain annelid worms , a constant flow is brought about simply by the contraction of arterial blood vessels , but in vertebrates generally , owing to the enormous expanse of capillaries developed , contraction of the arterial walls is not sufficient to keep the blood in motion , and a heart becomes necessary . As has been indicated , the heart acts both as a force pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventricles , and as a suction pump , drawing venous blood into the auricles . The rate of flow is not the same in all parts of the body . It is most rapid in the aorta where the initial impulse from the heartbeat is most strongly felt , and slower in the capillary area because here , although the individual channels are much smaller , the total stream bed is much greater , so that the result is the same as when a rapidly flowing stream , confined within narrow banks , loses its momentum upon spreading out into a lake . The rate of flow is faster of course when the animal is active than when quiet . The contractions of the heart of a hibernating fish , for example , may fall from over 100 per minute , to two or three , and that of a mouse , whose normal heart beat is about 175 per minute may , when frightened , go up to 600 per minute . // From a man 's heart when he is sitting quietly there is forced into the aorta about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon violent exercise , may rise to an output of thirty-five pints per minute . Since the total amount of blood in a human adult is approximately only ten to fourteen pints , it is evident that , while undergoing moderate exercise , the entire blood of the body passes through the heart probably at least twice every minute . Thus , by the most liberal estimates , the strenuous red blood corpuscles , in their brief lifetime of less than two weeks , travel many miles . The constancy of flow is aided not only by the frictional resistance of the moving blood against the inside of the blood vessels , but also by the adjustable variations in pressure upon the blood stream exerted by the contractile walls of the blood vessels under the regulatory stimulus of the involuntary nerve endings , or " stop-cocks , " a that supply them ( Fig. 275 ) . Although the heart beats in successive throbs , there is maintained a constant flow of blood , because the pressure is naturally higher in the arteries than in the veins . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some automatic device for adjusting blood pressure and controlling the flow , disaster would surely follow when-ever in the countless exigencies of life a sudden extra load is thrown upon this faithful pump . " As these terminal arteries number tens of thousands , and each of them is regulated and controlled , one can conceive how complex the stopcock system of the human machine is " Keith ) . The tireless beat of the heart itself is probably initiated and regulated at the sinu-auricular node ( Fig. 292 ) . This " pace setter of the vertebrate heart " is a narrow zone of fibrous tissue that marks the transitional region between the sinus venosus and the atrium in the fish heart , and which becomes incorporated as a part of the auricle in higher vertebrates . Another indispensable part of the mechanism of the heart is // the auriculo-ventricular node , a dense network of cardiac muscle fibers , connecting the auricular and ventricular walls , and acting somewhat like the " timer " in an automobile . Across this bridge the initiatory stimulus , originating in the sinu-auricular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart beat . The auriculo-ventricular node was discovered in the human heart by His in 1893 , and is consequently known as the Bundle of His . The central relation of the heart to other parts of the body is indicated in Fig. 293. 5 . The Valves of the Heart The most constant valves of the heart in the vertebrate series are the auriculo-ventricular valves , which separate the receiving auricle from the forwarding ventricle . They are present in all vertebrates and are kept from reversing under the pressure of the contracting ventricle by tendinous guys called chordw tendinae , that are anchored in the muscular walls of the ventricle ( Fig. 294 ) . There are two auriculo-ventricular valves in the heart of fishes , but in the double hearts of mammals there are five present , two // between the auricle and ventricle on the left side ( bicuspid ) and three ( tricuspid ) on the right side . The bicuspid valves are commonly known as mitral valves from a fancied resemblance to a bishop 's mitre . It was Huxley who once humorously said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lift . side of the heart , because he " never knew a bishop to be on the right side . " The semi-lunar valves of the conus region are best-left seen in elasmobranchs and ganoids , where as many as eight rows may appear in some species . They are cuplike pockets , lying flat against the inner wall as the blood passes out over them , but which fill immediately and block the passage-way when the blood attempts to retreat . Similar valves guard the exit from the heart to the pulmonary arteries and to the aorta in the higher forms . In the primitive heart of fishes , where the sinus venosus still persists as a distinct chamber , there is present between the sinus venosus and the atrium , a pair of sinu-atrial valves , that , like swinging doors , allow the blood to pass either way . This does no harm since both sinus and atrium have the common function of acting as reservoirs for returning blood . Between atrium or auricle and ventricle , on the other hand , one-way traffic must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consequently the mitral and tricuspid valves with their chordae tendineae , swing only so far and no farther . 6 . Evolution of the Heart The first step in the differentiation of the vertebrate heart , is encountered in the larval stage of the lamprey eel , Ammoccetes . The arterial blood vessel lying between the liver and the gills , // which represents the prophetic " heart " of amphioxus , becomes somewhat enlarged and modified . These changes involve first a constriction into the four chambers that characterize the typical heart of fishes , and second , a kinking of these chambers , necessitated by rapid growth within crowded quarters , so that they no longer lie in a straight line . In the amcnocutes stage the heart is still in the common body cavity with the liver , intestine , and other organs , but among fishes generally a transverse septum forms and ever after the heart is housed within the privacy of an enveloping space of its own , the pericardial cavity . In elasmobranch fishes the pericardio-peritoneal canal , a slitlike opening between the pericardium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment of pericardial independence . The next evolutionary step along with constriction and kinking is the differential thickening of the tunica media , by which means the thick-walled ventricle becomes established as an effective pump . The chambers of the elongated heart next telescope together , so that the sinus venosus , which is really an antechamber of the atrium , becomes 7 . Embryology of the Heart The human heart in its development is reminiscent of thee volutionary differences that are seen in the vertebrate series . Toward incorporated in the atrium to form the auricle , and the various modificalions of the cones arteriosus , become combined combined as a part of the ventricle itself . These changes are accompanied and followed by a gradual doubling of the heart , initiated in the Dipnoi and Amphibia by a partition which divides the atrium into two auricles , and is continued in the reptiles by partitions that bring about in similar fashion the formation of two ventricles , an end first completely attained in the Crocodilia , which is also characteristic of all birds and mammals ernal heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as right and left cardiac tubes which become fused into a median blood vessel , like that of amphioxus , soon kinking and going through the historical paces set by vertebrate forebears until , sometime before birth , with the obliteration of the foramen of Panizzae in the septal wall separating the ventricles , it becomes a complete , double , four-chambered , mammalian heart . At first the heart is outside the body walls ( Fig. 295 ) , but eventually moves in , through adjustments in relative growth relations , and takes up a permanent centralized position inside the protecting body walls . The formation of the heart from its double components , and its enclosure within the pericardium , are shown in Figs. 296 and 297. // V. THE ORIGIN OF THE CirculaTORY SYSTEM The beginnings of the circulatory apparatus appear very early in development since the transport of foodstuff to the focal point where the new animal is to materialize , is a primary necessity . In the chick ( Fig. 298 ) as soon as the fertilized egg has undergone preliminary cleavage , and the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ germ layers , certain peripheral cells of the splanchnic mesoderm become differentiated as blood islands . These consist of blood-forming , or hiemopoietic cells , and of flat endothelial cells which surround them to make the lining of the future of blood channels . The blood islands , which form a halo around the embryo on the surface of the yolk between the entoderm and splanchnic mesoderm are soon organized into a net work of // capillaries , that coalesce into a pair of definite blood vessels , the vitelline veins , one on either side . These lead directly into the growing body of the embryo where they unite in a common trunk , which is the beginning of the future heart ( Fig. 286 ) . From this , two primary aortic loops emerge and , after running back parallel within the body , continue outward to the capillary field as the vitelline arteries . This primary circuit , the first to be established in vertebrates with well-developed yolk , is called the vitelline circulation ( Fig. 299 ) . Budding off from the vitelline circuit within the enlarging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the head and tail regions . These , together with components salvaged from the temporary vitelline circuit , are destined to make up the permanent systemic circulation ( Fig. 300 ) . Still a third circulation , the allantoic , is necessary during the development of the higher vertebrates to meet the conditions imposed by embryonic life within an amnion . It consists of a pair of allantoic arteries , arising from the posterior region of the aortic loops , which pass out to supply the temporary saclike allantois . The returning allantoic veins enter the heart close to the vitelline veins . In mammals the allantoic arteries and veins become the umbilical arteries and veins , and form the nutritive and respiratory bridge through the placenta between the fetus and mother . The placenta itself is a compound capillary organ of double derivation ( Fig. 301 ) , the part from the allantois of the embryo interdigitating into the uterine wall of the // mother so that by osmosis there can occur a transfer of materials between the blood of the two . In the earliest known embryo in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allantoic circulation appears to take precedence over the vitelline circulation , a state of affairs not unexpected , since in mammals the yolk sac and accompanying vitelline blood vessels play a role of decreasing importance . The need of the vitelline circuit wanes with the vanishing yolk , while the allantoic circuit becomes useless upon hatching or at birth . Thereafter the systemic circuit takes up its functions and maintains them throughout life . The precarious transition from embryonic to permanent circulatory devices , involves profound modifications , and in mammals , where the umbilical cord is severed at birth , it is very abrupt . Three pairs of venous trunks , which undergo various fates , open into the embryonic heart . The first are the ducts of Cuvier , bringing in systemic blood from the head , body , and limbs ; the second , the allantoic , or umbilical veins from the allantois or placenta ; and the third , the omphalomesenteric veins , formed by the union of the vitelline veins from the yolk and the mesenteric veins from the digestive tube , which at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease to function with the transfer of respiration from the extra-embryonic allantois to the lungs within the body . The omphalomesenteric veins , just before they enter the heart , become surrounded by the growing tissue of the liver in which they break up into a capilINTERNAL // lary network ( Fig. 302 ) . The right vein degenerates , but the left persists as the hepatic portal vein between the intestine and liver . The proximal ends of both the right and left omphalomesenteric veins remain between the liver and the heart , where they are known as hepatic veins . CHAPTER XIII THE RELEASE OF ENERGY ( RESPIRATORY SYSTEM ) I. IN GENERAL 1 . The Respiratory Environment Every living thing of which we have any knowledge exists on the planet Earth , at the bottom of a vast atmospheric ocean . Air envelops not only all land surfaces but also extends to the uttermost depths of every body of water , large or small , so that aquatic as well as terrestrial animals and plants find themselves bottom-dwellers with respect to the all inclusive atmosphere . Oxygen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Of all organisms , only the extremely specialized group of anaerobic bacteria seem to be able to live without it . Although the atmospheric envelope is enormously extensive in every outward direction , the only part of it occupied by living things is comparatively the merest film in thickness , where the atmosphere comes in contact with the solid earth . The greatest vertical distance from the atmospheric floor reached by any organism , has been attained by modern aviators , who have outstripped even soaring birds . However , the exceptional altitudes gained by these human pioneers of the air must be regarded as insignificant in extent when compared with the distances involved in the horizontal exploration of the earth 's surface . Probably eighty per cent of all animals breathe free air . This category includes mammals , birds , reptiles , most amphibians , the great fraternity of tracheate arthropods , besides certain gasteropods among the molluscs . In the minority , innumerable aquatic invertebrates , fishes , and perennibranchiate amphibians , habitually breathe air that has been dissolved in water , that is , air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some animals , for example , whales and pulmonate snails , live habitually in water but come to the surface for free air , 356 // while a few exceptional ' land animals , such as the terrestrial isopod Porcellio , and the land crab Birgus , still retain , at obvious disadvantage , the primitive aquatic method of taking air in water by keeping their gills moist , although they have deserted the water as a medium in which to live . Since there is more available oxygen in free air than in air dissolved in water , free-air breathers in general exhibit more energy than aquatic forms , living as they do in a more favorable respiratory environment . Sea water , for example , has been found to contain from five to seven cubic centimeters of oxygen per litre , flowing fresh water , six to eight cubic centimeters , and free air over 200 cubic centimeters per litre . 2 . The Exchange of Gases When the Declaration of Independence was signed no one knew that respiration is a form of slow combustion , dependent upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear for the first time in 1777 . The exchange of gases which we term breathing is primarily a physical rather than a biological phenomenon . The taking in of oxygen is a process of passive diffusion that ceases as soon as the oxygen within the cells concerned balances with that outside . As a result of taking in oxygen , tissues are slowly broken down , while the energy used to build them up is released , much as " stored sunshine " from carboniferous plants is recovered in the form of heat-energy , whenever these fossils which we call " coal , " are burned under a draft of air . In both burning coal and the living body , the most conspicuous product of combustion is carbon dioxide . This is given off directly , since it acts as a poison when retained . In fact the removal of carbon dioxide is so urgent a matter that no animal can " hold its breath " very long without being compelled by an imperative stimulus quite beyond its control , to resume breathing movements . This powerful stimulus that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excess of carbon dioxide in the I flood . Neither the carbon dioxide of metabolism nor the oxygen of the air can be stored within the body , as food can . Consequently , although respiration may be reduced to a minimum at times of exceptional inactivity , it can not cease during life , a fact which 35S BIOLOGY OF VERTEBRATES sharply distinguishes a living , energy-producing organism from a dead organism . Respiration is an excretory function , with reference to carbon dioxide , for , in the maintenance of life , it seems to be of more importance to get rid of the deadening carbon dioxide than to acquire more oxygen , although the two processes go hand in hand and are both indispensable . Aquatic animals are easily killed in carbonized water , even if oxygen is present in sufficient amount for breathing . The excretory phase of respiration may be further demonstrated by the fact that when hydrogen sulphide is injected into the blood it is eliminated through the lungs . Physiologists distinguish between external and internal respiration . The former is concerned with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . The latter has to do with the essential transfer between blood and the tissues , or ultimate cells of the body which constitutes the effective part of respiration , and brings about the release of energy characteristic of life . The distinction between external and internal respiration disappears in small animals which have not elaborated a circulatory system , and the transfer of gases takes place directly through the undifferentiated surface of the organism in contact with its atmospheric environment . 3 . The Essentials for any Respiratory Device In order to utilize the oxygen of the air any living mechanism that has evolved far enough to have a true circulatory system , must meet the following conditions : ( 1 ) the blood that is to receive oxygen must he separated from the air by a retaining cellular wall ; ( 2 ) the wall must be sufficiently permeable to permit easy osmosis of gases ; ( 3 ) the wall must be kept moist in order to allow for thinness and permeability without drying up upon exposure to air ; ( 4 ) the total walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to insure an adequate osmosis of oxygen for the organism concerned ; ( 5 ) a current of fresh air must be made to pass repeatedly across the respiratory surface . These conditions are met in a variety of ways by different animals . 4 . Different Kinds of Respiratory Mechanisms In the more primitive aquatic forms , diffuse breathing through the sA1it precedes localized breathing through specific respiratory // organs , such as the gills or lungs , although both methods may be employed simultaneously , as in the Amphibia . Diffuse breathing is a decided handicap , since the necessarily delicate integument in animals that employ this method , is not only subject to mechanical injuries , but its possessor must remain under water in order to escape the disastrous effects of drying air . The two most successful breathing mechanisms among terrestrial animals are tracheal tubes and lungs . Tracheal tubes , which have been elaborated by the great specialized host of insects , consist essentially of ramifying tubes of inturned integument that admit air to the immediate neighborhood of the blood within the body ( Fig. 303 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vascular networks , with elaborate modifications for increasing the respiratory surface without harmful exposure to the dessicating effects of outside air . Sometimes the intake of oxygen and the outgo of carbon dioxide are effected by different parts or organs of the body . In many Protozoa , for example , oxygen is admitted through the surface ectoplasm , while the contractile vacuoles are concerned directly with the disposal of aceumulat-ing carbon dioxide . Aquatic amphibians , although acquiring oxygen principally by means of lungs , give off carbon dioxide , which has great solubility in water , largely through the skin . In addition to the gills , skin , and lungs of vertebrates , the tracheal tubes of insects , and the more primitive ectoplasmic devices of the Protozoa , any representative museum of respiratory inventions would be hound to contain a long array of devices that different members of the animal kingdom have to present , solving the universal biological problem of gas exchange . To cite only a few and the more familiar of these devices among invertebrates , there may be mentioned the ciliary system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , safe within the body cavity of the mudinhahitating sea cucumbers ; the curious respira360 BIOLOGY OF VERTEBRATES tory bladder of the rotifers ; the integument of the sinuous waving annelids ; the expansive mantle of molluscs ; and the compact lung books of spiders ; and among vertebrates , the curious respiratory tail of the goggle-eyed Periophthalmas of Indo-Pacific mangrove swamps ( Fig. 304 ) , a fish that remains for hours out on land with only its highly vascular tail submerged in water . Hylodes martenicensis , an Antillean frog which undergoes its entire metamorphosis within the egg , also accomplishes breathing during this critical period by means of a broad respiratory tail . It must not be forgotten , moreover , that in all reptiles , birds , and mammals , the allantois is provided as a temporary breathing organ during embryonic life . This highly vascular device for gas exchange is absorbed before hatching in the case of reptiles and birds , and in mammals is lost with the placenta at birth . The lungless salamanders which swallow air have a pharyngo-esophageal capillary network that acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gills , while the larva of the South American toad , Xenopus ( Fig. 305 ) , possesses a kind of integumentary chin whiskers which , according to Bles , are respiratory in function . Also in the case of the hairy frog , Trichobatrachus ( Fig. 306 ) , the " hairs " probably serve the same purpose . Certain fishes , such as Callichthys , Hypostomus , Doras , and Cobitis , breathe by means of a vascular rectum , alternately sucking in and squirting out water , and turtles in a similar fashion utilize a pair of lateral cloacal sacs with capillary walls . The air-breathing labyrinthine fishes , for example , Polycanthus ,
