Harvard University and the Path Film Co. agreed , last week , to the formation of the University Film Foundation . Pathe will do the financing and shoot the pictures in distant crannies of the globe . Harvard will furnish a site for a laboratory on its campus ; its faculty and students will help in putting the films together . Thirty films are expected to be finished by summer . Two-thirds of these will show home life among obscure peoples of Africa , Asia , the South Sea Islands , etc . The rest will show continents emerging from oceans , being eroded by volcanoes , water falls , floods . Explorers , zoologists , geologists , anthropologists applauded the idea .
