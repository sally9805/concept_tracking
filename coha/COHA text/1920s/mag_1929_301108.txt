Bad blood was let last week by the Senate Lobby Committee when , with many a painful poke and jab , it lanced the blister of feeling between the Federal Farm Board and private grain commission men ( TIME , Dec. 23 ) . The two-and-a-half hour operation without anesthetic was performed upon Julius Rowland Barnes , chairman of the board of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce , head of a three-million-dollar grain export house ( Barnes Ames Co. ) and chief of President Hoover 's Business Committee . Patient Barnes , restless in the witness chair , steadied his nerves by chewing on a lead pencil . <P> Mr. Barnes made a specific complaint against the Farm Board : " The Government should not loan money at 3% to the farm cooperatives to buy grain in competition against the grain dealers who have to pay 6% . " He called such loans " official favoritism , " suggested that they should be made to all grain dealers at the same interest rate . <P> Another Barnes objection : The pegging of wheat values by the Farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . ) . <P> Under pressure Mr. Barnes described to the Lobby Committee a meeting he had arranged this month at his Washington office between Chairman Alexander H. Legge of the Federal Farm Board and five big grain commission men to work out their difficulties . Said Mr. Barnes : <P> " The grain men asked Mr. Legge if the Farm Board had any deep-seated antagonism to their trade and he told them no . We then discussed the unfair competition between cooperative buyers and private buyers . Mr. Legge said he recognized this unfairness and that the present board policy is to lend cheap money only to the big wheat corporations-not to local buyers . . . . Mr. Legge said that , before promulgating any new policies , he would consult with business men to avoid unfairness . . . . " <P> With the committee Mr. Barnes left two impressions : 1 ) the Farm Board had at his protest changed its loan policy ; 2 ) private dealers would have a chance to review future policies of the Board . <P> Mr. Barnes was hectored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobbied " against the Farm Board or that he was a grain speculator . Chairman Caraway , accusing him of being " uncandid , " remarked : " If you sold wheat abroad the way you answer this committee 's questions , you 'd never sell a bushel . " Senator Blaine of Wisconsin asked Mr. Barnes " to cut out the Wall Street talk and speak in the language of the West . " <P> Chairman Legge rushed to the defense of his Farm Board . To the U. S. Chamber of Commerce , of which Mr. Barnes is board chairman , Mr. Legge retorted : " The Chamber wants the Farm Board to hang its clothes on a hickory limb but not go near the water . . . . They want to go forward slowly . If their idea of the Farm Board is the correct one , a 21-year-old boy should be made chairman , for we men in the middle 60 's would never live to carry out such a program . . . . The only fellow who has any real concern in the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat than a pink ticket . " *
