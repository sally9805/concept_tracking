txt A new use for the airplane , that of transporting Government exploration parties into the Alaskan was revealed by a telegram recently received at the Department of the Interior . It stated that the technical men or one of the geological survey parties , going into the Mount Spurr region , the exploration of which was begun last year , " traveled by air-tones from Anchorage to upper end of Lake Chakachamna , where field work will begin . " This use of airplane transportation put the men on the job two weeks earlier than was possible by ordinary travel , a matter of importance in the short Alaskan open season . It also reduced the size of the pack train that followed . There are this Summer six parties of the Geological Survey in the field in widely scattered areas of the territory . One party is making a reconnoissance topographic map of a part of the Ketchikan region of Southeastern Alaska , which will also serve as a test of the results of photographic surveying , another phase of work done by airplane . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be checked from the ground this year . Another bit of work that is this Summer under way in Alaska is a topographic mapping of a part of Admiralty Island . Yet another is that of carrying forward geologic investigations in the Nizina district of the Copper River region . Geologi : reconnoissance work in the upper Tanana and Yukon regions that lie west of the international boundary is also being advanced . The combined geologic and topographic reconnoissance work in the Alaska range region of Southwestern Alaska is going forwe I. Dr. Philip S. Smith , the chief Alaskan geologist of the Geological Survey , is making a swing around the circle of Alaska 's mining activities and also visiting some of his field parties . Some of the survey 's field parties are in extremely wild and difficult country , cut off from all communication with the outside world and dependent entirely upon their own resources . The importance of their discoveries can only be surmised until the men " come out " in September or October . The results of last year 's explorations included , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous lakes , unsuspected glaciers and an active volcano , the existence of none of which previously had bee-known . Most of the chiefs of the Alaskan parties  --  geologists and topographic engineers  --  are veterans in Alaskan work , and the engineer in charge of one party now in Southeastern Alaska has made some twenty annual trips from Washigton . C. , to Alaska and return . For sixty years Alaska has been a possession of the United States . At one time referred to as " Seward 's Folly , " it was , on the discovery of bonanza gold , recognized as real asset , and with this came a demand for authoritative information concerning an area nine times the size of all New England . So , for more than thirty years , the United States Geological Survey has every year sent out parties to explore portions of the big territory and to investigate its geography , geology and mineral resources . The geologists and engineers of- the Geological Survey have entered Alaskan rivers from one ocean , worked up to their soirees , portaged their canoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basin into the waters of a different ocean .
