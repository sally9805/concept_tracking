The draft text of a law authorizing vivisection of humans in an effort to discover a cure for cancer was unanimously approved , last week , by the board of National Sanitation at Havana , Cuba , and sent to the Cuban Congress for debate , action . <P> Criminals condemned to Death would be offered , under the law , a free choice between execution and inoculation with cancer . Twelve years would be the legal period of vivisection , and if , at the end of that time , the patient survived and had been cured he or she would return to society purged of guilt and perhaps honored as a hero , heroine . <P> While Cuba was thus preparing for direct , ruthless action , half way measures were again discussed , last week in London , by experts from 24 nations gathered for the International Cancer Conference . <P> Cancer Cause . Four hundred medical men listened intently to Dr. James Bumgardner Murphy , life member at Rockefeller Institute , as he described the experiments leading to his theory that cancer is caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. William Ewart Gye , famed propounder of the virus theory ( TIME , July 27 , 1925 ) were antagonistic ; Dr. Archibald Leitch of the London Cancer Hospital , whose experiments corroborated Researcher Murphy 's , approved . <P> Sixteen years of experimentation at the Rockefeller Institute substantiate this theory . Early in 1912 Dr. Murphy and his colleague Dr. Francis Peyton Rous produced tumors in young healthy chickens . From these tumors they made extracts ; inoculated more healthy chicks ; produced more tumors . Always the new tumor had all the characteristics of the tumor from which the extract was prepared . Extract from one species would grow only in the same , or occasionally in a closely related , species . This seemed scarcely the work of a microbe ; much more closely did it resemble the activity of a ferment or enzyme like the bacteriophage ( TIME , April 16 ) . <P> Last week Researcher Murphy announced : " Dr. Rous and I began experiments in 1912 . . . . But it was not until this year that I was absolutely convinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the **31;12707;TOOLONG of the principle has been conclusively established . Final proof must be the production of the same substance from materials which beyond all doubt do not contain virus . And this has been accomplished . " <P> Recent clamorous concentration on the virus theory , which is still in need of more conclusive evidence , throws the spotlight of controversy on the ferment theory . That too demands more research . Cancer controversialists agitate the Mur-phy-Rous experiments , eagerly await the forthcoming volume on the virus theory by Dr. Gye and Hatter Joseph Edwin Barnard which is now in preparation .
