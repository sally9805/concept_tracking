THERE never was a bigger , fatter , flabbier woodchuck than Tubby ? among wild animals that I alone have ' mown ? Tubby is a fixture of the farm . He was here when we came , or else it was his father or his mother , or one of his forbears . He is fat and flabby and as broad as he is long , and broader when full of beans . He is very much of a tub . When he sits in the garden he sits like a tub . When he runs he runs like a tub . It is worth a few beans to see him run , a medley in motions ? up and down and round and round , like the spinning of a top and the hop of a saucepan on a hot stove , with amazing speed forward . He knows which end of him is head and which is tail ; but from a distance I can see neither head nor tail , only sides , bulging , tubby sides spilling down the garden . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not more capable ? if there is anything so capable as a cut-worm ! A full-sized woodchuck is twenty-two inches long ; and I presume that Tubby is not more than twenty-two inches wide , though T have seen him wobbling out of the garden and carrying off as mere ballast a cabbage or two , and a watermelon , and a peck or two of beans , and all of the Swiss chard in three rows . There were several bushels of chard in those three TOWS . The way he can run with such a load , his little black heels twinkling through the vines , his shapeless carcass flopping into his hole with me on top of him ! Then I will hear a chuckling deep down among the hickory roots , a peculiar vegetarian chuckle quite unlike a carnivorous growl . And then I will sit down on the hole and chuckle , having lost for the moment mycarnivorous growl . He is so bold , so impudent , so canny . The old rogue rather likes me . And I am a fairly good gardener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place a trap in one entrance to his burrow he uses the other opening ; if I place another trap here he promptly digs a passage around it ; if I block this with chunks of rock he undermines the stones and patiently moves to a new house farther along the ridge ; and if I set traps for him here he changes house again . It is a wide , wooded ridge around the garden and honeycombed with woodchuck holes . By and by he is back in his favorite house under the hickory ? when the spiders have hung him a sign across the door that the traps are gone . But it happened once that I forgot the traps . Wood-earth and bits of bark and dead leaves washed down till the wicked gin was covered , and Tubby , coming back after weeks off on the ridge , tumbled into one of the nasty things and got his fat fist fast . I heard him making a big commotion and rushed up to see what the racket was all about . I had a club in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me . I do not believe that I was ever thoroughly looked at by a woodchuck before . Stolid , sullen , defiant , there was much more of Lite puzzled , of blinking , old-world wonder , in the baffled eyes gazing steadily into mine and trying to see what this situation and this moment meant . The snarled body was all fight and fear . But the blinking eyes sought mine for an answer to the riddle that I have asked of God . All that I could answer was , " You fathead ! " And he said , " Fat-head yourself ! " if ever a woodchuck spoke and spoke the truth . " Fat-head , to set this rotten thing here and forget it ! " It was a rotten thing to do . Somehow I felt as if I had trapped one of my neighbors . He saw how I was feeling , and took advantage of me . " Whose woods are these , anyway ? " he asked . " Whose ancestors were here first , yours or mine ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came here in Noah 's Ark . " " I know it . But keep quiet , " 1 begged him , " and stop looking at me that way . " " What way ? " he asked . " Why , so much like my brother ! " I exclaimed . " But I am your brother , " he retorted , " though I am ashamed to confess it . " - Do n't confess it , then , " I begged . But he was wound up . " Any man brute enough to set this sort of thing for his brother has no soul . And any man too mean to share his beans with his brother deserves no soul . If I were as low-down and as Lazy as you , I would go over to the north side of this hill and dig a deep hole , and crawl into it , and pull it in on top of me . " And all the time I was pressing down on the spring of the trap with my club , trying to free him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and away down in the sub-cellar among the hickory roots , there was talk of me which I should have heard , had I been able to understand . But there is much that I do not understand . There is much , too , that I can learn ; and there are some things that Pup , our old Scotch-Irish terrier , can learn . Time and time again Pup has sent old Tubby tumbling over himself to his hole . Once or twice they have come to blows at the mouth of the burrow , and Pup has come off with a limp or a hurt ear or a sore nose , but with only a mouthful of coarse , reddish hair to growl over . He came off with a new conclusion lately , and a greatly enhanced respect for Tubby . But Pup is of stubborn stock . So is Tubby of stubborn stock ? something American which neither the Scotch northe Irish have . Pup knows that here is an enemy of the people , and that he must get him . He knows that Tubby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows that Tubby is broader than he is long , and deeper than he is broad , which makes him pretty deep . This new light began to dawn on Pup when Tubby moved up from the woods to a corner of the ice house near the barn . The impudence , the audacity of the thing stood Pup 's hair on end . He took to the blackberry vines at the other corner of the ice house to see what would happen . Tubby 's raiding hour was about five of the afternoon . At that hour the shadows of the ice house and barn lay wide across the mowing field ? the proper time and color for things to happen . And there in the close-cut grass , as if he had come up out of a burrow , sat old Tubby , every bit as big as a bear ! Pup stole softly out to meet him , moving over till lie was between the chuck and the ice-house hole . It was a deliberate act , and one of complete abandon . Things this time must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But Pup had staged this battle many times before . Hugging the ground when the big chuck got up on his haunches to reconnoiter , Pup would be motionless till Tubby dropped down and went on with his feeding . Then gliding through the short grass like a snake , he would flatten behind a stone or mound , and work forward and wait . The ground rose slightly to Pup 's disadvantage , and he was maneuvering to avoid the up-hill rush , when Tubby heard something off in the woods , and turned with a dash for his hole . It was head-on and terrific ! And the utter shock of it , the moral shock of it , was more than terrific . Neither knew for an instant just what had happened ; not Pup , certainly , for the suddenness , the precision , the amazing boldness of the attack , put him almost out of action . But this was precisely the shock old Tubby needed . Every flabby fiber of him was fight . The stub feet snapped into action , the chunk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending him to the bottom of the slope , Tubby slashing like a pirate with his terrible incisors . The touch of those long teeth brought Pup short about . He likes the feel of teeth , the taste of pain . He is a son of battle , and in a moment like this , rises to more than common powers of body and soul . The fur flew ; the grass flew ; but scarcely a sound as the two fighters tumbled and tossed , a single black-brown body like a hail of pain . They sprang apart and together again , whirled and dived and dodged as they closed , each trying for a hold which neither dared allow . But Pup got plenty of hair , choking , slippery hair and leathery hide by the moutlif al , while the twisting , snapping woodchuck cut holes in Pup 's thin skin with teeth which would punch holes in sheet steel . And Tubby was fighting with his head as well as with his teeth and toes . He was cooler than Pup . He had a singletrack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head-work was perfectly clear ; the whole powerful play going forward with the nicest calculation , mad as it appeared to be in the wild rough and tumble . There was method in Tubby 's madness . He was fighting true to plan , But Pup was fighting to kill , and he lost his head . It was to win his hole , and life , and the pursuit of happiness on these ancestral acres , that the woodchuck was fighting ; and as the two laid about them and rolled over and over , they kept rolling nearer and nearer to the ice house and a burrow under the corner . Over and over , right and left , they lunged when the woodchuck , sent spinning from Pup 's foreleg , came up with the dog chopping at his stub nose , but giving him all four of his nailed feet instead , he bounded off the face of the dog , and with a lightning somersault , landed plop in his burrow , Pup raking the hair from a vanished haunch . And now Pup knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But du I fully realize that there is no bottom to the woodchuck ? I have been almost fatally slow over this lesson . Yet this is the writer 's first and most important lesson , no matter what his theme . " I have been studying the woodchuck all my life , " said my old friend Burroughs to me , " and there is no getting to the bottom of him ! " He made that great discovery early ; eighty-four years of study confirmed it ; and from early to late Burroughs never lacked for things to write about or failed of his urge to write . There was no bottom to his woodchuck . Others lin ve made this discovery concerning other things : the philosophers of truth ; the poets of men and flowers ; the prophets of God . But the writer must find it true of all things , of all his own things from woodchucks to , God . There is nothing new in this discovery . ft simply makes all things new to the discoverer . The skeptical , the shallow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but bowels to a woodchuck ? what would he at four and eighty find at Woodchuck Lodge to write about ? He might have all knowledge and a pen with which he could remove mountains , but lacking wonder , that power to invest things with new and infinite significance , he would see no use in removing the mountains and turning them into steppes , and pampas and peopled plains . All creative work , whether by brush or pen or hoc , is somehow making mountains into men , out of the dust an image , in our own likeness created , in the likeness of God . It may be woodchuck dust or dandelion dust or the shining dust of stars ; touched with a creative interpreting pen , the dust takes human shape and breathes a breath divine . A woodchuck pelt makes an excellent fur for a winter coat ; the rest of him makes an excellent roast for a dinner ; but it is still what remains , the wonder of him , which makes for sermon and for song . How hard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to learn ! And so slow have I been learning it that little time is left for me to preach or sing . If only I had known early that Mullein Hill was as good as Helicon ; that the people of Hingham were as interesting as the people of Cranford ; that Hingham has a natural history as rich and as varied as Selborne ! My very friends have helped to mislead and hinder me : " I do n't see what you find to write about up here ! " they exclaim , looking out with commiseration over the landscape , as if Wellfleet , or Washington , or Wausau were better for books than Hingham . Hanover may be better for ducks than Scituate ; but Hingham is as good as Hanover or Heaven for books . One of my friends started for Hanover once for a day of hunting ? but I will let him tell the story : " We were on our way to Hanover , duck hunting , " he said , " and at Assinippi took the left fork of the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right road ? ( An ancient doubt which had brought many a traveler before them to confusion and a halt . ) It was early morning , raw and dark and damp . No one was stirring in the farmhouses straggling along the road , and we were turning to go back to the forks , when the kitchen door of the near-by house opened and a gray-bearded man appeared with a milk pail on his elbow . " Is this the road to Hanover ? ' we called . " The man backed into the kitchen door , put down his milk pail , came out again , carefully closing the door behind him , and started down the walk toward the front gate . He opened the gate , turned and latched it behind him as carefully as he had latched the kitchen door , and stepping out into the road , approached our carryall . Looking up then down the road intently , lie hitched his right foot to the hub of our front wheel , spat precisely into the dust , and fixing his face steadfastly toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' You 're a damn long time saying it ! ' snapped our driver , wheeling about for the other fork . " At the turn I looked back . There stood our guide in the road , his right foot still in the air , I think ; and there , though it is twenty years since , he may still be standing ? one foot planted on the road to Scituate , the other resting on the hub of the wheel that should have been on the road to Hanover . " Neither the driver , nor my friend , who loves to tell the story , gets at its real suggestion . My friend seems to think there is something funny in it ! And there is something funny about the driver ? he is so perfectly obvious . He is truly New England , too . What a swift and vivid style that driver had , but how lacking his sense of the significance of things ! He did not appreciate the profound difference between these two forks of the road , the difference for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lived his whole life on the Scituate fork . And he was only driving the duck hunters . But the man in the road knew that this road ran to Scituate . He lived on it . Had they asked him , " Master , which is the great Commandment ? " he had answered : " Take this road for Scituate . " For were they not duck hunting in Hanover ? Then what profounder error could they have been in than on the road to Scituate ! But most people go that way for Hanover . Every young writer that I know hankers to get his Hanover ducks out of Scituate , as if failing to get ducks , he might get Scituate ; novelty , the mere novelty of gunning in Scituate when the ducks are in Hanover , making the best sort of " copy . " Is it some new thing that we should search out , or some deeper , truer thing ? Must we travel , or may we stay at home ? Locomotion is the curse of literature . No one nowadays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and himself in it , which is about all that he can know well enough to express . Let the writer stay at home . Drummers , actors , circus men , and Satan are free to go up and down the earth . And these seem to be writing most of our books . For some years now I also have been going to and fro and up and down in the earth , thinking that I might find some better place than Hingham . I have just returned from Wausau , Wisconsin , where they have a very hard red granite and a deep green granite , both of them the loveliest tombstone stuff that , I think , I ever saw . Certainly they are superior to our seam-face Hingham granite for tombstones . Up to the time of my Wausau visit , I had never given much thought to tombstones ; but it shows how one 's thought expands with travel , and how easily Wausau may surpass Hingham , not alone in gravestones , but in other , even in. literary materials . But Hingham has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wausau : I refer to the bowlders , old and gentle and mossy-grown , which lie strewn over our hilly pastures among the roses and hardhack and sweet-fern , ready to be rolled to the tomb , and fit for any poet 's tomb . When that shy spirit and bird lover , Bradford Torrey , a native of my neighbor town , Weymouth , died in California , he left but a single request : that he he brought back to his birthplace for burial , and that a Weymouth bowlder be found and rolled up to mark his grave . Were mine not Hingham howlders , I should take one out of my wall , the one which serves as a gate post , and with a yoke of Weymouth oxen would draw it to Bradford Torrey 's tomb , a tribute from Hingham to Weymouth , and a gift out of the heart of one who knows and loves The Foot-Path Way , A Ramber 's Lease , and A World of Green Hills . Perhaps one must needs go to California in order to come by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For if he is to write The Natural History of Weymouth or of Se'borne , he must return early and stay a long time . Thoreau has been criticized for writing of Nature as if she were born and broughtup in Concord . So she was . Can one not see all the world out of the Window in Thrums ? that is all of the world of Thrums , which is all of the world , and just the world , one goes to Thrums to see ? " I have traveled a great deal in Concord , " says Thoreau . This brings me back to Hingham . I wish that I could write The Natural History of Hingham ! A modest desire ! There can never be another Gilbert White ? hut not for lack of birds and beasts in Hingham . Were I a novelist I should write a Cranford ? and I could ! I should call it Hingham , not Main Street , though that is the name of perhaps the longest street in Hingham . But there are many other streets in Hingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am on Mullein Hill , Hingham , with all of these streets and all of these people , and woodchucks a-plenty , to write about ? and planning this day a trip to California ! I might have been the author of a recent book whose theme and subtitle reads : " In the plains and the rolling country there is room for the individual to skip and frolic , but all the peaks are pre-empted . " Come down from Mullein Hill ; get out of Hingham ; go West , young writer , as far as California ; there is room for you to skip and frolic on the plains out there ! It may be true in California , but the opposite of that is true in Hingham . To be sure , I have tried to pre-empt Mullein Hill ; I now own the knoll outside my study window , and the seven-acre woodlot beyond ; but there are many other peaks here among the hills of Hingham , and scarcely any of them occupied . The people of Hingham all crowd into the plains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Moab , leaving Pisgah to Moses , who found it very lonesome . There is no one on Pisgah now , I understand ; no one on Ararat ; no one on Popocatepetl ; no one on the top of Vesuvius , nor on the peak of Everest , peaks as well known as White Plains or the Plains of Abraham , but not anything like so crowded . Moses sleeps on Nebo , yet no man knows where he lies . Have them lay you in Sleepy Hollow if you wish your friends and neighbors to crowd in and keep you company . Why has there been no Blind of Hingham ? There are Helens in Hingham as there were Helens of Troy . Hingham is short of Homers . Mute , inglorious Miltons have we in Hingham . If one of them , however , should take his pen in hand , would he dream , and if he dreamed , would he dare to cry out to the Heavenly Muse , I thence Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song , That with no middle flight intends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme . Which of our poets thinks any more of an adventurous song , of attempting any more the unattempted in either prose or rhyme ? It is as if everything had been attempted , everything dared , everything accomplished , the peaks all pre-empted . Politics or religion or literature , it matters not : the great . days are gone , the great things are done , the great men securely housed in the Hall of Fame . Heaven offers us a League of Nations , and we prefer the tried and proved device of war ; a famed evangelist comes to town , we build him a vast tabernacle , and twenty thousand gather for the quickening message : " Brighten the corner where you are ! " And in the corners , and over the walls of the nation , with poster and placard the " Safety First " sign warns us not to hold our little rushlight too high or - flare it over far , for fear we set our brightened corner of the world on fire . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has escaped the devouring flame he is fiddling as emperors do ; and his poet laureate is writing free verse ; and all of his faithful subjects are saying over and over : " Day by day , in every way , I am getting better and better .

" Every rational creature has all nature for his CXT , VII.  - -  No. 877. - 13dowry and estate . It is his , if he will . He may divest himself of it ; he may creep into a corner , and abdicate his kingdom , as most men do , but he is entitled to the world by his constitution . " I have not spoken lately with a man who seemed to think he was entitled to the world . That grand old faith has passed away . But I talk with no man lately who does not think he is entitled to an automobile . Great is Tin Lizzie of the Americans ! Greater than Diana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ford , we are not overreligious . The Ford is a useful little deity ; she meets our needs to the last mile . The individual can skip and frolic with her , for she is distinctly the goddess of the plains and the rolling country . Admirable to her winking tail-light , she is one hundred per cent American , the work of one of the supreme inventive geniuses of our time . She is the greatest thing in America , chugging everywhere but up Parnassus . Even my quiet old friend Burroughs had his Ford . It was her creator himself who gave her to him . The creature would climb around the slopes and over the walls about Woodchuck Lodge like a side-hill gouger , Burroughs in his long , white beard driving her , as Father Time might drive a merry-go-round . He nearly lost his life in her , too . But everybody nearly loses his life so nowadays ; and nearly everybody had rather lose his fife in a Ford than to drag out an endless existence in a buggy or on foot or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go by . Perhaps our machines are taking us ? we wish to believe so ? to some new Arden , some far-off Avalon , where we shall heal us of our motor-minds , our movie-nerves , our corner-light religion ; where " Safety First " shall give way to " Derring Do " as a national motto ; where we shall ascend the empty peaks , and out of the thunder and smoke of shaking Sinai bring down some daring commandment , done by the finger of God on new tables of stone . We are not lacking courage . It is imagination that we lack . We dare . But we do not think it worth while . We are shallow , skeptical , conventional , out of tune with the infinite and out of touch with spiritual things . If we do not try the unattempted , it is because we believe that it has already been tried . It is because Homer has pre-empted Helicon that we tunnel it . Only Milton among us moderns ( and how ancient Milton seems ! ) , only Milton in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough on Helicon , and deeps within the abyss of Hades where Dante would be lost . No , Milton is not the only modern to leave the plains , and like a star , to dwell apart . Thoreau did it at Walden ; Lanier did it on the marshes of Glynn ; Burroughs did it at Woodchuck Lodge ; and Hudson did it on the plains of Patagonia ? proof enough that ponds and plains and the low-Iying marsh may be as high as Helicon for poetry , if only the poet have the vision to see that Like to the greatness of God is the greatness within The range of the marshes , the liberal marshes of Glynn . But here we fail . We no longer see the greatness of God in things . We have covered God with an atom . We ask for bread , and science gives us a stone ; for God , and science gives us an electron . It was a superelectron that created the heavens and the earth , when it saw that all the other electrons were without form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our religion , if it is religion . Man is only a bunch of willful atoms , or parts of atoms , not any longer the crowning work for Creation , its center and circumference , its dominion and destiny and glory , its divine expression , interpretation and immortal soul . Are we to be robbed of God , inhibited forever from faith by the lensed eyes of Science ? " What is man ? " I ask , and Science laughs and answers , " Electrons . " Thatis its latest guess . But does man look like them ? Does he feel like them ? Does he behave like them ? Does he believe like them ? In the laboratory he may . But out here in the hills of Hingham where I am returned to the earth , and to the sky , and to my own soul , I know that I am , and that I still hold to all those first things which Science would shame me out of , offering me electrons instead ! I accept the electrons . Capering little deities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you and I the sons of God ? and we are electrons , trillions of electrons if you like . Gods and atoms , we can dwell and think and feel as either , the two realms distinct and far apart , the roads between in a continual state of construction , dangerous but passable . The anatomist , laying down his scalpel , cries , " Such knowledge is too wonderful for me . I am fearfully and wonderfully made ! " - his science passing into poetry , and from poetry to religion , but not easily in our present frame and mood . Science clears the sight and widens its range ; but science can never:clear up the shadows at the bottom of a woodchuck . Only vision can do that , and science lacks vision , using a microtome instead , paring its woodchuck until he is thinner than sliced daylight , before ! it can see through so much as a single stained cell of him . Science turns aside from shadows , walking by sight or else standing still . It deals with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in literature and art as it is in life and society . The potent thing among men and nations is love . Love never faileth . Yet never were we so afraid of love as we are today ; and never did art and literature seem so fearful of the imagination , of vision , of the eternal , of the divine . " Go get me a bird , " the old scientist said to me . " I will give you a lesson in skinning and mounting . " I was a young boy . Hurrying out to the woods , I was soon back with a cuckoo . The face of the old scientist darkened . " You should not have killed this bird , it is the friend of man . See when I open this gizzard . " And with a dextrous twist of his fingers he turned inside out the gizzard , and showed it , like a. piece of plush , its fleshy walls penetrated with millions of caterpillar hairs . To this day I feel the wonder of that knowledge , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here was science and charity and poetry and religion . What untold good to man ! What greater possible good to man ? That was before I knew or understood the cuckoo 's song . And neither the old scientist , nor his book , ' Sixteen Weeks in &blow',; dealt with the song . Science is sure and beautiful with a gizzard . Poetry is sure and beautiful with both gizzard and song . And I wonder if the grinding gizzard or the singing throat is the better part of the cuckoo , even in this world of worms ? I have a great book , published by the government , devoted entirely to birds ' gizzards , mills of the gods , and their grindings . It is not a dull book , though the mills grind slowly and grind exceeding small . It is a book of bones , of broken beetles , seeds , hairs , feathers and fragments . It is a great work of science .

Nature will not do , nor all the truth of nature , for stuff of song and story . As life is more than meat , so is literature more than life . Nature conforms to art ; and in fiction " the only real people are those who never existed . " At Good Will Farm , Maine , there is a rock marked with a copper plate . It had been ' marked for drill and dynamite , until one day , my car swung up and overit at a sharp tarn in the road , skidding rather horribly on the smooth outcropping surface which had been uncovered and left as part of the roadbed .

It is the rock upon which the Mayflower landed in MO . But it is not now where it was then . It was moved many years ago up to the street . And when they moved it it broke . But they cemented it together . It is four or five feet long and three or four feet wide ; and it is inscribed with the famous figures , 1U0 , to celebrate the landing of the Puritans at that time . It is enclosed within a canopy of stone and an iron fence ; but the gate is hardly ever closed . There are a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous as any . My mother was visiting me .

As we entered Plymouth , however , I noticed that Mother had grown silent , and that her doctordaughter beside her on the back seat , always sensitive to her moods , was also silent . We descended the hill to the harbor , came on in sight of the canopy over the Rock , and slowed down to a stop . But the car had not stopped , when Mother , the back door open , her foot on the running board , was stepping off and through the open gate , where falling on her knees , with tears running down her face , she kissed the blessed stone , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the germs !

These are the eyes and these the lips of those , who , passing through Bacea , make it a well . Knowledge alone , though it course the very heavens , will come back to earth without so much as one shining fleck of stardust in its hair . The other day a great astronomer was delivering a lecture in Boston on the stars .

They had been carried up through the seven spheres to the very gate of Heaven then hurled to earth . The lecture failed ? not of instruction , not of emotion , but of will , leaving the listeners powerless and undone . The lecturer may be right ? for astronomy , and yet be quite wrong for poetry . He may have uttered the last word ? for science ; but this end is only the beginning of religion .
