Sydney Bulletin <P> Sirs : <P> I enclose check for renewal . TIME has become a necessity . A perfect antidote to wordy news and vain repetitions . Style reminds me of Sydney Bulletin , Australia 's national weekly . This paper was started without a staff , run mainly on contributions from all over the country , from mines , cattle stations and the bush . These were edited by the office . <P> Bad ones publicly roasted in the correspondence column making that like yours an amusing feature . Result the paper grew out of its native earth and some fine story writers and poets uncovered . Condensation was the main need . Editor Archibald used to say to us scribes : " If you have an idea for a story see if you can boil it down to ten-line par paragraph and then to a one-line epigram . " As he paid only on space it was Spartan ruling . The best sonnets ever written by Aussies-Bayldons on Marlowe and O'Downds " Last sea-thing dredged by sailor Time from Space " - received the same pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its red cover . Red is a masculine color and you are integrating the American mind out of its effeminate idolatry of words . Did you ever tell your 100% objectors to your red strip to begin with the flag ? <P> G. H. GREENE <P> Provincetown , Mass . <P> " Try to Collect " <P> Sirs : <P> About seven weeks ago I received the first issue of your weekly magazine . Since that time I have read rather in detail the issues . <P> I wish you would discontinue my name on your subscription list as I do not care to read it . In TIME , June 6* you quote a Chicago lawyer saying , Ceasar is as Grudus , + Washington is Benefict Arnold , and United States a Jefferson Davis , intimating that Jefferson , the elected President of a seceding organization , should be placed in the same group with the man who murdered his friend and a man who would trade his country for money . In your issue of May 30 , you quote Clarence Darrow , a Chicago lawyer , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question as to why there are so many different colors among Negroes- " It must be that so many white women have raped colored men . " <P> I understand that you are merely quoting what men have said but I do not care to even receive in my office or home a magazine that prints such statements . Therefore , discontinue my subscription and try to collect for what I have received . <P> O. D. BAXTER <P> Raleigh , N. C. <P> Anti-Coolidge <P> Sirs : <P> Discontinue sending paper to me and give the remainder of my subscription to someone you can fool with that Rebecca and Coolidge stuff . I have enough of it . <P> Where do you get the idea that your readers want to be plastered with a lot of humbug about Coolidge ? . . . That weekly babble you hand out is disgusting . I would not give ten cents in ten years to read about Coolidge much less ten cents a week . <P> A. C. HORSTMANN <P> Corona , N. Y. <P> Disapproval <P> Sirs :     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
