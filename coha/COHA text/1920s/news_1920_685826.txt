txt OUR FOREIGN LOANS . They Are Considered Essential to American Prosperity . In your , editorial article " Foreign vs . Domestic Loans " in THE TIMES on Thursday , Sept. 30 , you imply that the Norwegian loan for $20,000,000 , recently completed in this country , is different from loans negotiated by foreign Governments during the war . You say : " We servo the world better by supplying goods than credit and thus stimulating the production of goods taken In payment rather than the accumulation of debts taken in payment . " In . calling your attention to the fact that there is no distinction between this loan and former foreign war loans , I do so merely because it would result in the greatest harm to American Industry to have it understood that such transactions as the Norwegian loan are nothing more or less than financial in nature ; These transactions represent Just as much an exchange of goods as did any of tho war loans negotiated by the foreign Governments during the war . That it was a three-cornered transaction between Norway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that goods are being exchanged and not money . This kind of transaction , far from being condemned , should be highly commended , and the greater the caTtent to which our hankers and investors effect such transactions the sooner will exchange rates move toward normal . The urgent necessity for the equalization of exchange rates needs no emphasis . It should not be overlooked that the basis of these transactions is the shipment of commodities . When Norway obtained this luau here she obtained nettling but the right to claim goods or services from the United States . She could have taken the goods or services direct from us to her , but in the present circumstances finds it more convenient and profitable to direct us to transfer these goods and services to London , where ( she is a debtor . ' She liquidation of international debts by : the utilization of our surplus capital ( which is the surplus of our production over current requirements ) is and will continue to be a most important factor in the restoration of normal conditions in international trade . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as any other use that could be made of our surplus production . The fact that our goods are to be used in payment for ships that were built in England and will be used by Norway is an incident ' only , and of no real importance in the situation . When the capital requirementaof our railroads are met they will receive not money nor credit , but production of rails , loco-. motives , cars and other equipment . The shipment of commodities to Europe does not And will not interfere with this in the slightest . This principle is ably illustrated by Albert W. Kimber , a recognized authority , in his book on " Foreign Government Securities , " in which he says : " The borrowing country needs the ' goods , and though it may sometimes borrow in one country and spend in another , what it really gets Is goods . The lending country can only lend if it has goods and services to supply , whether these goods are of its own manufacture or from some other country . When Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States might buy some of the steel rails in Belgium or Germany , instructing London - to pay those countries for her purchases . In such a case England would send goods or services to Belgium or Germany , or pay them with her claim on some other country , Brazil , for example , to which she had sent goods or services . But the basis of all the transactions was the goods and services , and when Britain made the loan she gave the borrower nothing but the right to claim goods or services from her , a right which the borrower could exercise or transfer to some other party , as he saw fit . " It is absolutely essential to the continued prospeitity of American industry that we continue to lend money to all foreign countries whose financial condition warrants the extension of such credit . It is only through such loans that American industry will be able to keep production at a normal rate . This means a surplus production which must be exported , and as practically all foreign . countries owe us money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our extending credit to them . PERKY ? B. STRASSBURGER , Manager .
