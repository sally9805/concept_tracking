In the mess of epics which the newspapers print concerning bitter-faced aviators who fly grimly across oceans and continents for glory or their mothers there should be no word of a flight which began last week at Stag Lane Airdrome , near London . Not an epic but an airy epigram , it told the story of a rich old man and a charming lady and soldier . <P> The Rich Old Man was the celebrated Harry Gordon Selfridge who , as everyone knows , worked his way up through Marshall Field 's Chicago department store before leaving the U. S. and setting himself up in England with a huge store of the same kind , a huge house in the centre of London , four children , and many dear friends , among whom the Dolly sisters are surely the most intimate . <P> Among the rich old man 's four children , is the onetime Violet Selfridge , who is now the Vicomtesse de Sibour. * <P> Jacques de Sibour was an ace and a great ace in the War , a fact which not everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selfridge it became necessary for him to go to work in the Selfridge store for the rich old man . Thus Jacques de Sibour and his wife lived in Lansdowne House , the grand and picture-filled castle in the centre of London . When Jacques got a two weeks holiday , they toured all about the Mediterranean in a tiny airplane . When they were granted a longer vacation they flew to Abyssinia and built a house in the desperate mountains . <P> Last week the time had come when the Vicomte deserved another long holiday . He and his wife conferred as to what they should do . This time they had nine months at their disposal-obviously , the proper thing was a trip around the world . Obviously also , if you have been an ace , you understand that the majority of aeronautical accidents are the pilot 's fault and that being up in the air , so long as no one is shooting at you from another plane , is as safe as being on the ground and much more pleasant . Accordingly , the de Sibours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses 4 gallons of gas and not quite a pint of oil per hour . It is a blue and silver Moth , named Safari II . The de Sibours will fly only when the weather is right and if they lose their way they will land their little plane most anywhere and get directions . They will be ferried across the largest bodies of water . <P> The Vicomte and Vicomtesse de Sibour had their hunting clothes sent on to Africa ; trunks of tropical clothes together with trifles were despatched to Bombay and Penang . They took with them however in two bags which were stowed into the De Haviland Moth , evening clothes and other proper equipment for polite traveling . At the airdrome , a reporter asked questions which de Sibour answered with a little diatribe on the advantages of aviation . " The running expenses come to $15 per week at maximum . . . . My wife and I have n't been in a train all year . ... If you see an interesting tower or castle on the horizon , even if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have a look at it . If you are flying over the seashore , you can fly low and watch people bathing . That is the kind of thing we propose doing . It does n't matter if it takes us off our course . We will find it right away again . "
