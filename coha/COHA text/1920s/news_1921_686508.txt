Being I am the one about whom that statement was made , I find it to be most necessary that this statement should be corrected , and I am sure your reporter will verify my correction .

Should you take it on your part to print my correction of the above statement in your daily papers , I will stand by my belief in the American press , of the accuracy of their statement , or of its correction when they see where they are wrong . If not , of course , I have not a thing to say . ELIAS KAWAM , King Solyman Ra-e Al-Abja , Protector of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
