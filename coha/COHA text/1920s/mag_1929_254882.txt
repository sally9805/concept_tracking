WORLD COURT In the nine years of its existence , the Permanent Court of International Justice - offspring of the League of Nations-has been the subject of mountainous reams of essay , interminable hours of debate . It has rendered just 17 judgments . In 1920 U. S. Minister to Switzerland Pleasant A. Stovall signed World Court articles of adherence for the U. S. Government , only to have , the U. S. Senate place so many reservations on U. S. participation that other member nations refused to accept the Stovall signature . <P> Last week the spotlight of world attention focused on another U. S. diplomat . With his pockets stuffed with authorizations from President Hoover and Secretary of State Stimson , Jay Pierrepont Moffat , U. S. Charg D'Affaires at Berne , * traveled from London to Geneva to sign World Court articles of adherence once more . <P> Diplomatist Moffat , plump , pleasant , pompous , is no nobody . He is the socialite scion of the three venerable Manhattan families whose names he bears , a Harvard graduate , a son-in-law of U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as social secretary to the White House in the Coolidge Administration , he held that delicate post until its duties were transferred to a division of protocol in the state department . Attach Moffat 's most important previous diplomatic work was with the U. S. Legation in Warsaw during Soviet Russia 's brief attempt to conquer Poland in 1920-days that brought him in touch with Herbert Hoover and Cardinal Achille Ratti , now Pope Pius XI . In a dingy Geneva office , proudly titled the Treaty Registration Room of the League of Nations Secretariat , he carefully signed three state papers , then retired to Berne . <P> These signings were really a triumph for ancient and honorable Elihu Root , U. S. elder statesman who spent a furious fortnight last March smoothing World Court-U . S. differences , drafting the Root Formula ( TIME , April 1 ) which in effect left the U. S. entirely free to divorce the World Court instantly at any time after the final diplomatic marriage takes place . The marriage is not yet , the signature of Attach Moffat was a mere betrothal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagered that another year would pass before this is achieved . <P> *Minister to Switzerland Hugh R. Wilson had gone home to the U. S. for Christmas .
