The Calles Government betrayed a not unnatural jumpiness last week , while Secretary Kellogg was whooping up his " Red Mexico " scare in Washington ( see p. 6 ) . President Plutarcho Calles knew , and has admitted publicly , that if the U. S. should withdraw its embargo on arms ' shipments into Mexico a new revolution would detonate his regime overnight . Therefore , since it could not be known at Mexico City that President Coolidge was not really going to lift the embargo , the Calles Government committed several hysterical acts : <P> Bishop Arrested . Since the Primate of Mexico , Archbishop Jos Mora y delRio , is an old and feeble man ( TIME , July 26 et seq. ) the real head of the Episcopate is its Secretary , Bishop Pasquale Diaz of Tabasco , a pure-blooded Mexican Indian , a smiling but doughty fighter against the anti-religious laws . During the crucial hours of last week Bishop Diaz expressed himself in fervent unbridled fashion to members of the informal U. S. investigating committee now touring Mexico . Apparently the Calles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bishop Diaz , and concealing the place of his detention . This served only to make the Bishop a subject for rumor , mystery , speculation , sympathy . . . . <P> Decoy Revolution . Equally rash was a proclamation of revolution in Mexico by a band of little known men supposed to be Mexican Knights of Columbus , but suspected of being decoy agents of the Calles regime . One Rene Capistran Garza proclaimed himself " Provisional President of Mexico , " though he remained in hiding ; and the whole movement which claimed to be supported by onetime under " Generals " of Pancho Villa loomed ridiculous . The Government rashly made this " revolt " an excuse for terrorism in the interior . <P> Tongue Gouged . At Mexico City a leading newspaper , Excelsior , reported the " Calles terror " as hysterically as it had flayed " Coolidge hypocrisy " the day before . Cried an editorial : <P> " Shootings are the order of the day through all the Republic . We can cite a number of cases which prove our statements , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of Leon in the State of Guanajuato , which , for cruel , barbarous , inhuman and unjust treatment , has sown the most profound discontent throughout the republic . . . . <P> " There a rebel band of youths of good family was seized by the authorities , who found the lads unarmed but hustled them off to execution in the public square . Before the preliminaries to the execution were arranged , one young boy started to cry . His companion , Valencia Gallardo , a boy less than 20 years old , showing great courage , tried to console his companion and called to him in a loud voice to pray to God for help and comfort . <P> " This advice on the part of Gallardo caused the police to become indignant and , seizing the boy , they deliberately cut out his tongue before placing him in front of the firing squad . . . . " <P> When the Kellogg scare seemed guttering at Washington last week , despatches reported less hysteria in Mexico .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
