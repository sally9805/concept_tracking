The route was from the lobby into Market Street , west half a block to Washington Street , south half a block to Camfield Court , an alley fifteen or twenty feet wide leading to the stage entrance and thence into the theatre . The elephants were chained together , with heavy bands of steel linking the right hind feet of the first and second animals to the right front feet of the second and third elephants , and ten or twelve feet of . chain between each . A. keeper walked alongside each beast // few minutes before 2 o'clock yester- with a long sharp " bull hook " ready to plunge into the flesh behind the ear , the most delicate part of an elephant 's anatomy , in case the animals should become fractious . Beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many children , watched the animals walk through the street and enter the alleyway . Nothing happened until they got halt way through Carnfield Court and were backed up against the brick nail of the theatre . Just what happened then to frighten them is not definitely known . The elephant nearest the street suddenly emitted a shrill shriek . wheeled around and plunged toward the street , carrying her chained companions with her in the stampede . A crowd which bad followed the procession and stopped at the entrance to the alley scattered as the elephants scampered into the street . In their first rush they turned south on Washington Street  --  away from Market Street . The three keepers ran alongside of them , jabbing them behind the ear with the bull hooks , and got them under control in a few minutes . They turned the animals around and led them back toward the alleyway , apparently subdued . As soon as the lead elephant saw the entrance to the alley for the second time , she let out a loud trumpeting sound and broke loose again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashed straight along Washington Street toward / ' , Tarket , past the alleyway . taking up most of the sidewalk and part of the street . Woman Runs Too Late . The woman who was killed had been standing at the curb in Washington Street , near the corner of Market , apparently waiting for a surface car . On all sides people scattered and ran in every direction , but she stood as if petritiea until it yeas. too late . As she started to run she was caught beneath the mad rush of the elephants and was knocked down and trampled by the animal in the lead . The right side of her chest was crushed , all of her ribs on the right side were broken and half of those on the left side were broken .

Finally , in front of Eamberger 's store . the keepers got a good hold with their bull hooks and the pain forced the elephants to stop . The animals were trembling with fear . After a few minutes . during which the keepers tried to calm them , they led the elephants to Sorhagen 's warehouse on Shipman Street , a theatrical transfer station , where they were put into the cellar . An automobile took the unidentified woman to the hospital . where Dr. H. B. Martland . Chief Medical Examiner of Essex County . said she undoubtedly had been killed instantly . Act Is Called Off .
