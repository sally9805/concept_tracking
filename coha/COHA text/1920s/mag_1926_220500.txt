PLAIN TALES OP THE NORTH- Thierry Mallet-Putnam ( $2 ) . Captain Mallet is president of a fur company ( Revillon Freres ) whose flag , flapping at the masthead of a trading schooner , has been watched for and hailed by Indians and Eskimos on the headlands of Labrador and Hudson 's Bay for two centuries . Besides traveling in Siberia and soldiering in France , Captain Mallet has visited these hardy trappers many times . Evidently he has found time for good reading on his trips , or maybe it is through his Gallic inheritance that he comes by the lucid , restrained prose in which , a page or two at a time , he relates brief episodes of camp and trail . They are quiet , unpretentious little sketches , dramatized no whit , yet filled with the mystery and magnitude of nature , wild and human , that the writer has experienced " north of 53 .
