Parisian publishers can not get M. Georges Eugene Adrien Clemenceau , famed " Tiger of France , " to write his memoirs . They can only console one another by making a good story out of his sharp , testy rejoinders when they approach him . Last week one more disappointed and rebuffed seeker after the memoirs of M. Clemenceau told ruefully what " Le Tigre " had growled at him : <P> " Write my memoirs ? Jamais ! Never ! Why should I ? I do not need to write them . The people of France will do me justice anyhow - eventually . . . <P> " They should be glad that I do not write memoirs ! I would place too many Great Ones in a bad light . I should have to tell the truth about many persons and events - which would be too cruel . . . . " <P> " But , M. Clemenceau , would you deprive others of the pleasure which you yourself no doubt enjoy-the pleasure of reading the War memoirs of your contemporaries ? " <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clemenceau , " I never read War books-jamais ! They are untrue-all of them ! Why should I read what some other man has to say about the War when I probably know more about it than he does ? "
