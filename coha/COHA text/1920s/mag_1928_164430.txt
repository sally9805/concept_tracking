The baseball season always begins on a cold grey day . Celebrities with stiff fingers and blue noses wish they had n't promised to throw in the first ball . President Coolidge in a brown fedora , Mayor Walker in spats , Mayor Mackay of Philadelphia in his winter overcoat , tossed in the new white balls and in New York , Brooklyn , St. Louis , Cincinnati , Philadelphia , Washington , Boston , Detroit , Chicago , the games began . Mostly the crowds yelled to keep warm , but in Manhattan they had another reason . Before them occurred a dramatic happening . <P> For years the managers of the New York clubs have been trying to develop a Jewish player . There are plenty of Italians , Swedes , Irishmen in baseball-few Jews . Critics have pointed out that a Jewish star on a New York team would pack in thousands of new spectators at every game . And now , on the bright turf in front of them , the people saw a Jew begin his career-Andy Cohen , second baseman , picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famed Rogers Hornsby . And when Cohen had brought home the first Giant run of the season , had driven in the tying and winning runs with a two bagger against the left-field fence , had had a bat in every Giant rally , fielded quietly but effectively , and made the greatest debut in the history of baseball , the spectators , chilly no longer , rushed onto the field and carried Cohen off on their shoulders . " He 'll draw like Ruth or Gehrig , " said Manager John McGraw.
