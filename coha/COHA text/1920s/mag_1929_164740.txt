Three years ago there was no Borger , Tex . Then from deep-driven pipes in Hutchinson County spurted oil . Today Borger is a city of 10,000 , county seat of Hutchinson , a slovenly clutter sprawling over the prairie with a main street two miles long . In this motley oil town 's brief career have been committed 40 murders , with not a single conviction . The killing of District Attorney John A. Holmes last month finally prodded Governor Dan Moody to declare martial law in Borger , to send in National Guardsmen of the 56th Cavalry Brigade under the command of Brigadier General Jacob F. Wolters . <P> Experienced cleanser and quieter of Texas towns is burly , bronzed General Wolters . After the War he took his rangy troopers to Galveston Island , there quelled a festering longshoremen 's strike . Later he was sent to oil-booming Mexia ( pronounced Mayhea ) where bootleggers and guntoters had usurped municipal government . " Mopupus Jake " and his troopers drove the usurpers to the hills , followed them in airplanes , corralled them . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City and county officials were conniving with scofflaws , winking at murders , sponsoring speakeasies and brothels . General Wolters supplanted the conniving officials with his Texas Rangers . Khaki-clad patrolmen directed traffic , policed the suddenly quiet streets . Drinkers no longer rioted in wide-open saloons but tippled alone at home behind locked doors . Bootleggers and daughters of joy , hearing the oldtime frontier command to " get out of town by sundown , " scuttled away . The women barbers changed to clothes from pajamas . <P> Last week Borger was cleaned up . General Wolters , satisfied , left for Houston and his law practice . Said he : " Well , we finished the job at Borger . The Sheriff , the Mayor , the City Commissioners , the Justice of the Peace and the Constables resigned , and for good measure we took the resignation of an involved member of the legislature . . . . With the new officials whom we installed . . . Hutchinson County will be the tamest county in Texas . It was a great job . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
