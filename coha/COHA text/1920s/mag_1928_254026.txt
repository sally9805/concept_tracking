Radio warnings , sent by the Dutch government , are now scurrying around the East Indies warning the Javanese and Sumatrans to beware Krakatoa . The small island volcano in the Sunda Strait , between Java and Sumatra , is yeasting to explode again . Already it has drooled a small land mass into the adjacent water . At any time it may blow up as it did in 1883 . <P> That explosion-many people can remember the fury-was the most violent in modern times , reports the National Geographic Society . It " made the biggest noise " ever heard by man . Three thousand miles away , on Rodriguez Island near Madagascar , its sound roared four hours after the happening . In South America , 10,000 miles away , the tide was raised . Waves around the East Indies archipelago were 100 ft. high and went 400 miles an hour . Volcanic dust blew 20 miles high ; swift upper winds carried the dust around the earth in 20 days . Sunlight was murky ; sunsets were apocalyptic.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
