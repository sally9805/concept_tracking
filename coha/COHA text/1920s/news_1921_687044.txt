txt So far as can be seen at present , cheap oil is a thing of the past . The new condition is due to the fact that production of vast quantities of crude oil in Mexico at low cost is declining and that in the future production of Mexican oil will be better controlled . There never was a time in the oil industry when it had the advantage of such an abundance of cheap oil as it had in the last few years from the Mexican fields . The producing wells in that country are located only a score of miles in from the seacoast , which made the cost of transportation to market small . The wells yielded prodigious amounts of oil over long periods . The Casiano basin produced an average of more than 100,000 barrels of oil to the acre , an amount not approached by any other field anywhere in the world . Recently during the glut of oil in Mexico , individual producers who had no pipe line to the coast offered oil as low as 30 cents u barrel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States will maintain the average of 1920-21 . It is likely that consumption of oil will tend to in : crease over present rates through improvement in domestic and export business . The latter is about one-half of normal at present , but domestic- demand holds ; up surprisingly well in view of general conditions . Indications now point to a serious pinch in oil within two years . Present big supplies are apt to save the situation during the next year , but after then the situation become acute , in the opinion of those best informed . in respect of new fields the cost , of getting the oil is sure to increase . It is not profitable to market oil from South America with the market for crude in the United States at $1.50 . It will cost $1 a barrel to transport . the oil through 1,000 miles of pipe line , as must be done from sonic of the South American fields , to say nothing of additional costs to get the oil to market .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
