Sh ! The Octopus . There were two detectives , Mr. Dempsey and Mr. Kelly . They could not refuse a wisp of a girl who asked them to investigate a certain Long Island lighthouse wherein people were frequently murdered . On discovering a painter in the lighthouse , Mr. Dempsey tells Mr. Kelly to find the painter 's pallet . Whereupon Mr. Kelly tells the painter to open his mouth , but it is Mr. Dempsey who announces that all painters have weasels . Then lights blink , doors swing , screams are screamed-and people appear , one by one , a shaggy seadog with a hook for a hand , a chirping grandmother , a hail-girl-well-met , etc. , etc . They are all looking for a fellow surnamed The Octopus who hangs humans by the feet when he hears the tick of a clock . They go down into the vault of the lighthouse where an octopus tickles Mr. Kelly between his shivering ribs while nobody is looking . Upstairs again for the third act , everybody confesses to be a detective . But one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing the others with mystic thunderbolts until an octopus gets him . A terrible noise , like a malignant god stripping his gears , ensues . The curtain goes down , and then up , showing Mr. Dempsey and Mr. Kelly awakening from an alcoholic dream . <P> There was some doubt whether the authors ( Gallaher &; Welch ) of Sh ! The Octopus were trying to be funny or spooky . But they were both . And the audience went shhh-before every act . Clifford Dempsey and Harry Kelly , playing under their own names , were simply splitting . <P> Dr. Knock . There are those theatregoers who wince when they see , propped up on the stage , a cardboard automobile . To them , this frail vehicle is a symbol for many estimable qualities of stage technique-loud clowning , eccentric costuming , futuristic scenery , boisterous laughter from the actors on the stage-which they , in hypersensitive hauteur , sometimes distrust .

These scenes , beautifully played by Aline MacMahon , allow the audience to appreciate the profound , wholesome and unfamiliar fact that Maya , for every man and for a moment , appears as the incarnation of his desires , that the face of this prostitute glitters , in the cracked mirror of each customer 's longing , as the image of an ideal . This tenuous truth does not make for dramatic continuity ; the play Maya stretches it against a background of homely and revelatory incidents in the life of its heroine-the death of her child , the visits of her comrades in vice , the rapid entrances and exits of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
