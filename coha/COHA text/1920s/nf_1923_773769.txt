She , with her half breed husband and small child , accompanied the expedition when it began its onward journey in the spring of 1805 . There was real need for them not only to act as guides and interpreters , but to replace those who had been sent back down the river with reports of the progress and observations of the expedition up to this time . Part of the duties of the expedition , as heretofore intimated , was to note the character and productivity of the land , as well as the nature and number of Indians found and general information concerning them and their mode of living . When the falls of the Missouri were reached there seemed to be an impasse . But from logs and other timbers found there they constructed a crude wagon on which their supplies and equipment were transported to the river above .

They attempted to get pitch by heating pine tree trunks but were again unsuccessful . They resorted finally to a combination of powdered charcoal , beeswax , and buffalo tallow ? practically natural products of the land . The boat floated nicely and they were greatly encouraged but when it was taken from the water the mixture dropped off and the seams opened up . Lewis finally gave up the attempt and buried the framework and built canoes according to the Indian fashion . In passing up they came to folks in the river and were often at a loss which to take . By conference with the Indian woman and reports of scouts sent ahead they were usually fortunate in choosing the right course . Being explorers of a new country they assigned names to the rivers as they discovered them . At three forks , they called the rivers , Gallatin , Madison , and Jefferson , names which they still retain . Three branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these names have not Transportation Development in the United States 51 remained ? probably they were too fanciful ? the Philanthropy is now the odoriferous Stinking Water . They followed up the Jefferson until it became too shallow and precipitous to navigate longer . Lewis started out overland into the interior hoping to find an Indian habitation and someone who would guide him to waters flowing Pacifieward . Game , which had been very abundant practically all the way , was here scarce and the company were often hungry , and very likely despondent . After arduous and weary wandering Lewis came across an old Indian woman and some girls . They were afraid of him and bowed their heads for execution . Instead he gave them trinkets and face paint . The men of the tribe having come up he with difficulty persuaded them to go with him to the river where the " Bird Woman " who had come with them from the Mandan village was recognized as the sister of the chief of the band with which Lewis had fortunately come in contact . Their food up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied from the numerous herds of buffalo , elk , deer , and antelope ; from flocks of wild fowl , and prairie chickens ; and from several varieties of fish found in the waters . " On the return voyage , when Clark was descending the Yellowstone River , a vast herd of buffalo , swimming and wading , plowed its way across the stream where it was a mile wide , in a column so thick that explorers had to draw up on shore and wait for an hour , until it passed by , before continuing their journey.715 They frequently found hungry wolves , grizzly bears , and rattlesnakes which gave them more or less trouble , but they complained mostly of the mosquitoes . But now having left the open country they found game very scarce . The Indians occasionally brought them a Rocky Mountain sheep but they themselves claim never to have seen one alive .

Hunger harassed them , while rapids and whirlpools made their downward travel very disagreeable . The Indians on the lower reaches were generally friendly but their food consisted largely of dog meat , which at first was nauseating ; however , after awhile they became recon-ciled to the Indians ' favorite dish . The party wintered on the coast at a post they named Fort Clatsch . The damp winds here were cold and raw and to persons used to active outdoor life the winter 's en-forced idleness cloyed , and they were glad when spring came and they could turn back .

Clark for a portion of the way subdivided his party in order that the maximum terri-tory might be explored . They met again at the confluence of the Missouri and Yellowstone and concluded their expe-dition at St. Louis , September 23 , 1806 . Thus ended a marvelous journey of three and a third years through a wilderness beset with many dangers , inhabited by savage tribes , venomous reptiles , and ferocious beasts ; but a wilderness on the whole extremely friendly , abounding in succulent vegetation and edible game , and endowed with a healthful and invigorating climate . During all this time , notwithstanding hardships and exposures , one man only had died , one had deserted and not more than two Indians had been killed . 16 To Lewis and Clark for their ability to handle men , for their courage , and fidelity should be given much praise . Upon the report of this expedition being made public Transportation Development in the United States 53 very many hunters , trappers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These in turn were followed by bona-fide settlers . Soon this country was furnishing supplies for those farther east , the great rivers Missouri , Mississippi , and Ohio being busy routes of internal commerce . As a result of Lewis and Clark 's labors the United States was able to lay claim to the Oregon country some years later . The door was opened for the development of a vast empire with versatile resources far beyond the fabled riches of the far east . Transcontinental Trails. ? Following the purchase of the Louisiana territory there was , of course , an extension of settlement to the prairies beyond the Missouri . The State of Missouri was early occupied and became a state in 1821 , but it was many years later before other portions of the Louisiana Purchase were sufficiently settled to become territories.17 The settlement of these lands , together with the opening up of Oregon and later California with its great gold rush , created a demand for transcontinental roads . The mountain ranges were searched for passes , possibly not so much for the purposes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading posts which large companies established throughout the whole Rocky Mountain region . St. Louis became the greatest fur center in the world , a position which she probably holds 54 Transportation Development in the United States still.18 Provost , leader of a detachment of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company ( Wm . H. Ashley , of Virginia , founder ) , found the South Pass by way of the Sweetwater branch of the North Fork of the Platte River , 1823 . This pass held preeminence as a crossing through the Rockies to the great interior basin and to the Pacific coast . Already has been mentioned the crossing of Lewis and Clark in the North . Bridger discovered the pass in Southern Wyoming bearing his name , about 1824 . This defile though wide enough for an army to pass through seems narrow because of its lateral walls of red granite and metamorphic sandstone extending almost perpendicularly from 1000 to 25,000 feet . The overland mail route prior to the building of the Union Pacific Railroad was through this pass . Jedediah Smith , who succeeded Ashley as head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region from Great Salt Lake to the Pacific , and from San Diego to the upper Columbia River in Canada . To him is the world indebted for its first knowledge of much of the vast region west of Salt Lake as by other active members of this company was revealed the sources of the Platte , the Yellowstone , the Green and the Snake Rivers , and possible routes through the almost impassable mountains drained by them . New England was especially interested in the Oregon country and through men from there the Humboldt River route was discovered . During this same period there were being opened up trade and trade routes with the Spanish possessions farther south . In 1822 a wagon train was taken from Missouri to Santa Fe by a man named Beckwith to trade for horses and mules , and trap along the way . For years St. Louis was headquarters for many overland traders to these regions , taking to them cloths and other manufactured goods and bringing back furs , silver , mules , and horses . The Oregon Trail , the Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States 55 Trail and the Gila Route , had become quite well known by the early ' thirties and after the discovery of gold in California in ' forty-nine carried many people and much traffic across the continent . Origin of the Oregon Trail. ? At Bellevue the Nebraska State Historical Society erected , June 23 , 1910 , a monu-ment a part of the inscription on which reads : Commemorative of the Astorian Expedition organized June 23 , 1810 , by John Jacob Astor 's American Fur Company . This Expedi-tion discovered the Oregon Trail which spread knowledge of the Nebraska country leading to its occupancy by white people . John Jacob Astor 's purpose in organizing the Pacific Fur Company , a subsidiary of the American Fur Company , was to establish himself and American control in the already disputed Oregon country.10 As a result two expeditions were fitted out to go to and establish trading posts in Oregon with a central control or main post at Astoria . One of these expeditions went by water around Cape Horn to " carry out the people , stores , ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mouth of the Columbia River . " The other " conducted by Mr. Hunt , was to proceed up the Missouri , and across the Rocky Mountains , to the same point : exploring a line of communication across the continent , and noting the place where interior trading posts might be established . " 20 The overland expedition , consisting of about sixty men with four boats left their winter quarters in Missouri and proceeded up the river in the spring of 1811 . They de-viated somewhat from Lewis and Clark 's route by leaving the Missouri River at the mouth of the Grand River , near where the Pacific extension of the Chicago , Milwaukee , and St. Paul railroad crosses . They seem to have gone across the country north of the Black Hills into Wyoming to the Wind River and Wind Mountains south of the Yellowstone Park , using present-day terms for locations ; thence a short 58 Transportation Development in the United States Santa Fe Trail. ? This road passed westward and a little south to the Arkansas River , which it followed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek and over the Raton Pass to Las Vegas ( New Mexico ) . Then westward through Apache Canon to Santa Fe . This trail was too rough for wagon traffic , so later a route which crossed over south from the Arkansas to the Cimarron and meeting the old trail at Las Vegas was used . Gila and Spanish Trails. ? Two routes were possible from Santa Fe . One southwestward by way of the Rio Grande and Gila Rivers into southern California . The other took a northwesterly direction up the Chama River , down the Dolores Valley , and across to the Grand River near the present site of Moab , Utah . Then west to the Sevier , up which it followed until it crossed over to the Virgin River ; up this for a short distance then turned directly soul h-west across the Mohave desert toward Los Angeles . This last route received the name of Spanish Trail . Many of these trails were difficult on account of ' scarcity of water in the deserts . Descriptions of early travel over them are replete with hardships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were marked with wooden , stone , or iron markers with names roughly chiseled , but more received no marking whatsoever . Many travelers and settlers were killed by the Indians ; the tribes apparently becoming more hostile as the number of whites increased until their own numbers became so decimated they could no longer command sufficient warriors to warrant further attacks . It would seem as though no advance in civilization is unaccompanied by its toll of human lives . Era of Turnpildng. ? The need of better transportation facilities was " borne in " on the people of the eastern part of the country long before the west had been developed . The Indian trail , a single path , ? for they always traveled in single file ? gave way to the " tote path " over which each year the settler 's surplus crops were transported to market on pack animals . Even if they owned wheeled vehicles the Transportation Development in the United States 59 roads were generally so bad they could not be used . How-ever , wheeled vehicles were not many prior to 1800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsyl-vania he called upon the colonies for wagons , but Maryland and Virginia furnished only twenty-five . He appealed to Franklin , who by his influence was able to secure 154 wheeled vehicles 22 from Pennsylvania , probably the best supplied with wagons of all the colonies . It was the custom for communities to join together after crops were gathered to start a caravan of packers to market.23 A master driver with one or two assistants could manage a pack-train of a dozen or so horses . " Hides and peltries , ginseng , and bear 's grease " are mentioned as articles to be bartered for salt , iron , nails , pewter plates and dishes , and cloth and articles of clothing , although the latter were usually made at home . The horses traveled in single file each fitted with a natural crotch of wood for a tree . Hobbles and bells were provided that the horses could be turned loose to graze at night . Sometimes packs had to be taken off to be carried over streams or through narrow defiles . Naturally , methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised . Stock ? cows , sheep , and pigs ? could be driven to market by the raiser or sold to a drover who acted as a middleman . Farm products were concentrated by being fed to stock or manufactured into something requiring less space . Settlers complained that it required two bushels of grain to get one to market . Whisky and brandy were easily made , served to concentrate the grain and surplus fruit and always had a ready sale . When the government placed an excise tax on it the opposition was so great as to produce an insurrec-tion in Pennsylvania ( 1794 ) . Had there been good trans-portation facilities probably there never would have been a " Whisky Rebellion . " Sixteen gallons ( two kegs ) of whisky worth $1.00 per gallon east of the Alleghanies was 60 Transportation Development in the United States a horse load ; whereas the same animal would only pack about two bushels of grain worth , perhaps , 80 cents . That packing was a business of considerable importance is shown by a statement in " The History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa. ) " quoted by Dunbar : " Sixty or seventy years ago five hundred pack horses had been at one time in Carlisle , going thence to Shippenburg , Fort London and further westward . " This was written in 1848 . Naturally so much traffic induced men to make packing a , means of livelihood . They became so numerous and strong that when wagons began to take over the business of freighting they considered it an infringement upon their vested rights . But as goods could be transported more easily and cheaply by wagon the old had to make way for the new . Wagon roads and at first two-wheeled then fourwheeled vehicles began to appear . This created a demand for better roads . At first that consisted in merely widening the packtrain trails . But about the beginning of the nineteenth century , Tresaguet in France , and Macadam and Telford , in Great Britain , were building broken-stone roads which greatly changed and augmented he internal commerce and the industry of those countries . The most populous and wealthy of the colonies likewise began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Braddock 's , had been constructed ; there was a road along the coast of Massachusetts , and some roads and bridges in the interior , there were roads connecting the larger cities as from Boston to New York and from New York to Philadelphia . The cities in order to retain and extend their trade needed highways of commerce . Turnpike Roads. ? The construction of turnpike roads many of which were stoned was encouraged by a number of the states , especially by Pennsylvania . The Lancaster turnpike from Philadelphia to Lancaster was " stoned " in 1792 by throwing on it stones of all sizes . These were afterwards removed and stones " passing a 2-inch ring " substituted . This is said to have been the first scientifically Transportation Development in the United States 61 built hard surfaced road in America . In 1800 Pennsyl-vania fostered the construction of a system of turnpikes ( toll roads ) , by granting franchises and subscribing stock , which was eventually to cover the state and control the west-ern market . By 1828 there had been 3110 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of miles of fine turnpike roads including many good bridges placed Pennsylvania in the lead for internal improvements . But other states were similarly employed . New York and New England by 1811 had chartered 317 turnpikes.2i4 Virginia appropriated funds " to be used exclusively for river improvements , canals and public high-ways , " in 1816 . South Carolina voted a million dollars , in 1818 , to be raised in four annual levies for similar purposes . During these years the states were opening public roads but the only good roads were those built by the turnpike companies , which erected gates and collected tolls every few miles . This resulted in a higher cost of transportation than was liked by the public who clamored for free roads and canals . They were wanted by both the producer and the merchant . The turnpikes were opposed to anything which would tend to reduce their control of transportation . Wagon Road Desuetude. ? The introduction of the steam railway with its quicker , better , and cheaper form of transportation put out of existence the freighting and coaching business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roads which had had a thriving trade found their toll boxes scarcely held enough to maintain the gate keeper . As there was no adequate system of maintenance , although many of them had been macadamized , they gradually fell into a state of disrepair . Freighters and coachers gravitated westward or took shorter runs as feeders to the railroads . Turnpikes , built as private or semi-private enterprises , were gradually being taken over by the public and maintained by local road overseers . The old practice 62 Transportation Development in the United States of calling on the freeholders to work out their road tax annually was in vogue and is still in use in places . By it no road was ever kept at a high state of efficiency . Even the National highway , the Cumberland Road , which had been constructed to Vandalia , Illinois , and surfaced with stone to Columbus , Ohio , at an expense to the nation of nearly seven millions of dollars , had lost its ardent supporters . Jackson 's theory that national money should only be spent for roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each state should be the unit of government and look after all its own internal affairs , seemed to prevail . As a result wagon road building further than to make a mere way for crop marketing at odd seasons of the year stood still until bicycle enthusiasts began an agitation for better roads about 1890 . However , a real awakening to the advantages of good roads came only after the advent of the automobile about 1900 . National Participation. ? The Revolutionary War had shown the need of roadways for quick intercourse between the seaboard and the trans-Alleghany regions . The efforts of the different states , still retaining their colonial jealousies , to secure the control of the trade of these regions emphasized the need of a unifying influence which would bring harmony . The debate proceeded in a desultory fashion for a number of years . Strict constitutionalists did not believe the national government has the authority to construct roads at all . States ' rights men argued that road construction is the province of the states and the National Government has jurisdiction only in the territories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved a bill to survey and construct a road from a point on the Potomac near Cumberland to the Ohio River near Steuben ville popularly known as the Cumberland or National road , and appropriated therefor $30,000 . This was in the minds of friends of government control to be the beginning ; there was increasing need of travel and traffic facilities from the Hudson to the Great Lakes , from the Delaware to the Ohio ; from Virginia and the Carolinas to Kentucky and Ten66 Transportation Development in the United States by one of their fellows , have a Virginia hoe-down , sing songs , tell anecdotes , and hear the experience of drivers and drovers from all points of the road , and , when it was over , unroll their beds , lay them down on the floor before the bar room fire side by side , and sleep with their feet near the blaze as soundly as under a parental roof .

The success of the Cumberland Road to the Ohio created demands for its extension . In conformity to this demand $10,000 was appropriated in 1820 to lay out a road from Wheeling to the Mississippi River near St. Louis . This continuation was for a road 80 feet wide and in spite of much congressional objection and occasional presidential vetoes , the road was pushed on ; the last appropriation being made for a portion west of the Ohio , May 25 , 1838 . The exact total of all appropriations amounted to $6,824 , - 919.33 . The road proper reached southern Illinois . States wanted appropriations for other roads , but these were pretty generally vetoed . One important case was the veto , 1830 , by Jackson of the bill authorizing a subscrip-tion by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paris , and Lexington Road Company . The com-pany was incorporated in Kentucky to build a road from the Cumberland Road at Tanesville , Ohio , to Florence , Alabama , on the Tennessee River , which had been surveyed by U. S. engineers in 1827 . Maysville , through which the road was to pass , was on the south side of the Ohio River , Transportation Development in the United States 6 and did considerable trade in Kentucky and Tennesse A census was taken of the existing road , admitted to 1 in bad condition , showing an average daily traffic of 35 persons , 33 carriages and 51 wagons . The $150,000 to I subscribed by the government was not to be paid until a equal amount had been subscribed in equal parts by th State of Kentucky and private individuals . Other bills c a similar character were before Congress , one for a roa from Buffalo to New Orleans having been laid on the tabb and opponents of the bill insisted any road anywhere coul be as well regarded to be a national road as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bi of a similar tenor was vetoed.31 Jackson evidently doubt the constitutional right of the government to enter int internal projects of this character . In his message to Cor gress he had conceded that " every member of the Union , i peace and in war , will be benefited by the improvement c inland navigation and the construction of highways in th several states , " he noted the opposition to methods heretc fore adopted as unconstitutional and inexpedient . H therefore proposed an amendment to the constitution , to b submitted if it could not otherwise be done , whereby th surplus revenue might be appropriated to the several state in proportion to their representation in Congress for th purpose of internal improvements . State sovereignty wa always to be maintained . In 1838 when the road had reached Southern Illinois new element entered the industrial world . The railroad were proving their ability to compete most suceessfull with other forms of transportation . The building o national highways ceased ; canal and river transportatio were practically put out of business with the entrance o this new leviathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say nothing of north and south routes , which unfortunately did not mature in time to prevent the great Civil War a half-century later . Alfred Gallatin and Henry Clay sponsored the Cumberland Road . The former in compliance with the wish of Congress ( 1808 ) drew up a scheme for a national system of internal improvements by roads and canals at an annual expense of $2,000,000 for ten years . But its opponents were able to stay it off and the war of 1812 coming on caused financial troubles and the entire scheme was indefinitely postponed . The first appropriation for the Cumberland Road had been made , not from the general funds of the government , but from the proceeds of the sales of land , a fiction , of course , for the benefit of the strict constitutionalists . Gradually , however , Congress came to accept the doctrine of " implied powers . " Madison in his last message invited the attention of Congress " to the expediency of exercising their existing powers and , where necessary , of resorting to the prescribed mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of roads and canals , such as will have the effect of drawing more closely together every part of the country , by promoting intercourse and improvements and by increasing the share of every part of the common stock of national prosperity . " 25 Up to this time there had been completed only 23 miles of the road . In 1816 , $300,000 was appropriated for its completion ; two years later $260,000 was voted ; but a proposal to appropriate $600,000 for internal improvements failed in 1817 , as did also a bill providing for the extension of the Cumberland Road . But as a result of the labor of Henry Clay , Albert Gallatin , Thomas Jefferson , President James Madison , and other friends of cheap and rapid transit , by 1820 the total of Congressional appropriations for the Cumberland Road amounted to more than $1,500,000 ; in 1844 the thirty-fourth appropriation made a total of nearly $7,000,000.2 The growth of the road was Richardson , " Messages and Papers .

Thus had the old Indian trail developed into a route for Washington and his band to Fort Necessity ; into Brad-dock 's road to Great Meadows ; into a pack train trail trampled by thousands of caravan hoofs ; and , finally , into a finished paved highway cleared to 66 feet in width , having no grade above 5 per cent which Washington and Jefferson and Madison had visions would be the means of binding together with the strong bands of commerce the cis- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The road im-mediately proved its worth . The mail coaches were placed upon it ; great freight lines were established having their own stage houses and depots in towns along its way ; inns and hotels thrived ; apparently the " pulse or the nation beat to the steady throb of trade along its highway.27 Like the Appian Way it became noted the world over . The National , Good Intent , June Bug , and Pioneer stage coat lines were common names as are the Pennsylvania , New York Central , Burlington , and Union Pacific railroad lines of to-day . The coming to town of these coaches , which had developed from the plain square box , through the oval type to the finished Concord painted in brilliant colors , perhaps bearing the name of some prominent personage , drawn by four and six horses , with the proud and arrogant driver often better known than the eminent patrons whose names Transportation Development in the United States 65 now grace the pages of history , was an important event in the work of the day . Hardly had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking the tired animals to rub-down , rest , and feed , bringing on fresh high-stepping spirited ones , champing their bits , apparently very anxious for a galloping start toward the next post ; the passengers were alighting to stretch their legs , rest and refresh themselves at nearby food " emporiums " or select an inn from among the claims of numerous barkers ; agents were transferring and recording baggage , mail , and express ; and the curiosity loungers constituted most of the remaining populace . The stage driver , Westover , made a record of forty-five minutes for the 20 miles between Uniontown and Brownsville , while " Red " Bunting 's drive of 131 miles , with the declaration of war against Mexico , in twelve hours remains , like Paul Revere 's ride , a part of the nation 's history . The amount of traffic over the National road was tremendous . The annual traffic was probably not less than 3000 wagons .

I have staid over night with William Cheets on Nigger ( Negro ) Mountain when there were about thirty six-horse teams in a wagon yard , a hundred Kentucky mules in an adjoining lot , a thousand hogs in their enclosures , and as many fat cattle in adjoining fields . The music made by this large number of hogs eating corn on a frosty night I shall never forget . After supper and attention to the teams , the waggoners would gather in the bar-room and listen to the music on the violin furnished CHAPTER III WATER , WAYS AND CANALS From the earliest exploration and settlement periods rivers and coast inlets have been used for transportation . As has been pointed out , the Indian , before the coming of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Boats and barges propelled by oars , poles , or snubbed along by ropes attached to trees on the banks were in early use . Along the coast and the larger rivers sails were made use of . Upon the ocean there was a large development in wooden sailing vessels . The great number of American ships and the inroads made by American merchants upon English trade had much to do with bringing on the war of 1812 . Canals. ? Canals had shown their usefulness in England and other European countries , for transporting the internal commerce cheaply and efficiently ; it was but natural , therefore , that they should be considered in the United States . The first canal was in Orange County , New York , and was used for transporting stone as early as 1750 . Numerous short canals were constructed in Pennsylvania , New York , and Massachusetts prior to 1810 , but the peak of canal building came after this date . The first lock used in the United States was part of a canal extending from the Schuylkill River to the Susquehanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Northwest Territory going to Philadelphia on account of the turnpikes which had crossed the Alleghanies through state and private means , was anxious to do something to get control . An agitation for a canal joining the Hudson River with Lake Erie or Lake Ontario consummated in a commission , 1810 , 70 // headed by Gouverneur Morris , to investigate the question of building one or both of the canals which seemed feasible , namely ( 1 ) from Albany up the Mohawk and westward to Lake Erie near Buffalo ; ( 2 ) from Albany to Lake Champlain , thence an opening to the St. Lawrence , which had already been surveyed . In 1812 a second commission was formed which included with Morris , such men as De Witt Clinton , Robert Fulton , and Robert R. Livingston . An endeavor was made to secure Congressional aid . The war coming on no action was taken , but the demands for the canal continued . To the energy and political ability of DeWitt Clinton is attributed the final success of the enterprise . When he was elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his administration . He stirred public interest by addresses and presented a convincing memorial to the legislature . He argued that " As a bond of union between the Atlantic and western states it may prevent the dismemberment of the American empire . As an organ of communication between the Hudson , the Mississippi , the St. Lawrence , the Great Lakes of the north and west , and their tributary rivers , it will create the greatest inland trade ever witnessed . The most fertile and extensive regions of America will avail themselves of its facilities for a market . All their surplus productions , " he prophesied , " whether of the soil , the forest , the mines , or the water , their fabrics of art and their supplies of foreign commodities , will concentrate in the city of New York , for transportation abroad or consumption at home . Agriculture , manufactures , commerce , trade , navigation and the arts , " he continued , " will receive a corresponding encouragement . That city will in the course of time become the granary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactures , the focus of great moneyed operations , and the concentrating point of vast , disposable and accumulating capitals , which will stimulate , enliven , extend , and reward the exertions of human labor and ingenuity , in all their processes and exhibitions . And before the revolution of a century , the whole island of Manhattan , // covered with habitations and replenished with a dense population will constitute one vast city . " 1 As bombastic as this may seem his predictions have been more than realized and the realization began with the com-pletion of the canal to Buffalo in 1825 . There grew up along its way the great cities of Buffalo , Rochester , Albany , and scores of smaller ones . The products of the entire west did seem to flow through it , for the tolls are said to have been a half million dollars per year immediately upon its completion and over a million by 1830.2 This the largest canal project in the United States is still in use . As first constructed , it was 40 feet wide at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats . It was later enlarged to a general width of 70 feet and depth of 7 feet , navigable for boats of 240 tons burden . Some of the locks had been replaced by power lifts ; the transfers are more quickly made . The increase of New York 's prestige of course diminished that of Philadelphia . Pittsburgh was , too , growing up at the head of Ohio River navigation and in the coal and iron regions of Pennsylvania . While numerous canals had been constructed by private enterprises an extensive system of canals was begun under an act of 1825 , to connect Philadelphia with Pittsburgh as well as other objective points . Jealousies sprang up over the state , as usually do with any improvement . Always one part thinks the other is getting more than its just share . But notwithstanding , nearly a thousand miles of canals have been constructed in Pennsylvania , some of which washed out and were never replaced , some were abandoned and some are still in operation . In Ohio two canals were built by the state from Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . One of these extended from Toledo through Defiance , St. Marys , and Dayton to Cincinnati ; the other from Cleveland through Akron , New Phila-delphia , Coshocton , Newark , Columbus , Chillicothe , to // Portsmouth . Branch lines were run down the Muskingum to Marietta , down the Hocking to Athens , and from Junc-tion westward to Antwerp to connect with the Indiana canal system . Making a total for Ohio about 1000 : ' miles . In Indiana the Wabash &; Erie Canal , begun about 1834 , was constructed through Fort Wayne , LaFayette , Terre Haute to Evansville , in 1853 , on its way to the Ohio River . By this time the railroads had paralleled its course and its trade had practically ceased . One of the earliest projects , said to have had the backing of President Washington , culminated , eventually , in the Chesapeake &; Ohio canal extending from Georgetown , the upper limit of tidewater on the Potomac , to Cumber-land . After numerous efforts and years of talking , repre-sentatives of Maryland , Virginia , District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of Washington and passed resolutions stating that " Whereas the connection of Atlantic and Western waters by a canal leading from the city of National Government to the River Ohio . . . is one of the highest importance to the states ... Resolved that it is expedient to substitute for the present defective navigation of the Potomac River , above tidewater , a navigable canal from Cumberland to the eastern base of the Alleghany and to extend such canal as soon thereafter as practicable to the highest constant steamboat navigation of the Monongahela or Ohio River . " Jealousies between the states delayed matters somewhat , but in 1825 the proponents obtained governmental partici-pation . Delays occurred for various causes , but in 1828 Congress authorized the U. S. treasurer to subscribe for $1,300,000 worth of stock and went further and guaranteed // subscriptions made by the towns of Washington , George-town , and Alexandria to the amount of $1,500,000 . The United States had then once more endorsed the policy of spending national money for internal improvements , and had become a partner in a canal proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opponents fought it in the legislatures of Maryland , Pennsylvania , and Virginia , as well as in Congress . In two years the money was gone and the canal not com-pleted . Maryland extended further aid , and then still more aid by the help of which the canal was completed to Cumberland in 1850 . In 1870 efforts were made to have the Government carry the canal on to the Ohio River , but the plan was never consummated . This canal is still in use , the bulk of its traffic being coal brought down to Washington . Canals were constructed in many other states , but they need not here be followed in detail . Illinois was connect-ing Chicago with the Mississippi River ; Massachusetts built artificial ways about falls and rapids ; New Jersey connected the Hudson with the Delaware ; and numerous other schemes were carried out . Canal Prosperity and Desuetude. ? Until the greater ad-vantages of railway travel and traffic lessened the useful-ness of the canals , they did a thriving business . As has already been noted with regard to the Erie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole United States there was a " grand total of 4,468 miles 5 of canals , costing approxi-mately $214,141,802 . " Not all these were remunerative . To the end of 1872 the New York Canals had only averaged // a profit of 3.2 per cent , while the Erie Canal proper paid but 4 per cent on its costa The speed at which the barges traveled was about 2 miles per hour ; this was reduced on account of time lost by regular stops , passing through locks , and accidents , to 1.7 miles per hour on the average . Rates for freight were about 0.3 cent per ton per mile . The rail-roads later hauled through freight at 0.7 cent per ton per mile . Both these rates were , no doubt too small , for proper maintenance and remuneration . Passenger traffic , notwithstanding the slow speed , amounted to a considerable volume . Packets were in use , that for workmanship , finish and convenience vied with the Pullman cars which later supplanted them . They were decorated in bright colors ? green , yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows and panels done in contrasting and harmonizing shades and tints . On the interior in addition to compartments for the crew which were separated from those for the passengers , were usually a large general assembly room ordinarily occupied by the men for lounging , writing letters , playing games , and pro-tection from stormy weather . There was a special cabin for the women , also lavatories and conveniences for men and women . In addition there were kitchen , lockers , and cupboards . Three times daily the assembly saloon was t ransformed into a dining room by re-arranging and set-ting the tables which constituted a regular part of the room 's furniture with others of a temporary nature , car-ried stored away on the boat , into one long table lengthwise of the room . The captain and his two assistants ? the mule driver and steersman not on duty at the time ? performed this service and waited upon tables . At night both the saloon and ladies ' cabin were converted into dormitories by attaching shelves about 6 feet long and 31/2 feet wide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by wooden supports extending from the floor . In each berth was placed a " mattress , " that is a tick having some straw in it and a pillow of similar make . // The passenger usually furnished his own sheets if they were wanted , although some of the later boats were sup-plied with sheets and coverlets . The berths were three high along the wall and had curtains suspended in front of them . The passengers selected their berths in the order in which they had secured passage , late comers being obliged to sleep on the tables or on the floor . Sometimes the whole floor was thus covered . Travelers complained bitterly of the mosquitoes . Crude as this may seem at the present time , these packets were no doubt the forerunners of the present Pullman palace car . The outside decks and the roof of the car were utilized for promenading , loung-ing and sight-seeing . They were often enlivened by music and dancing . Greeley ' speaks of the " cent and a half a mile , mile and a half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts in quotations as though it were common or a slogan . Charges on the Wabash and Erie Canal in Indiana were for the 221 miles from Cincinnati to Fort Wayne , $6.75 ; 138 miles from LaFayette to Fort Wayne , $3,75 ; 104 miles from Fort Wayne to Toledo , $3.25.8 An average of about three cents per mile . The canals were unable to compete with the railroads when time became an element . Passengers would not be content to travel 36 miles per day along a tortuous canal when they could travel a much more direct route at nearly 36 miles per hour . The swifter speed of freight traffic accelerated business ; the merchant 's capital could he turned over more frequently ; his net profits were conse-quently greater . Is there any wonder , therefore , that the business of the canal continually decreased while that of the railroad as continually increased . Many canals were actually abandoned , others allowed to depreciate from want of proper maintenance , and now only occasional barges are run to transport heavy non-perishable freight such as grain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of // better terminal facilities and the time element , the railroads soon were carrying much more than the canals . Ship Canals. ? Reports show the tonnage of the Erie Canal to have continually decreased from 2,031,735 tons in 1911 to 667,374 tons in 1918 . The total tonnage of all the New York state canals shows a like decrease from 3,097,068 tons in 1911 to 1,159,270 tons in 1918 . Notwithstanding such records there are those who firmly believe canal transportation will again take an upward trend with better terminal facilities and possibly electric propulsion . There is one class of canals that seems to have held its own , that is ship canals . The great canal and locks at Sault Ste. Marie transfer a vast lake traffic annually from one level to another between Lakes Superior and Huron . Vast quantities of iron-ore are brought in mammoth vessels by this route from docks near the Mesaba mines for the great iron mills at Gary , at Cleveland , at Pittsburgh , and other points . Similar vessels loaded with wheat , oats , and flax from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the seaboard . Agitation has been going on for some time to enlarge the Welland Canal and its locks between Lakes Erie and Ontario , thus giving seagoing vessels the opportunity of coming up by way of the St. Lawrence River and traversing the entire Great Lake system . The ambition of cities is here again manifest ; Chicago would like such transportation , but it would not be beneficial to New York . A ship canal across Cape Cod saves 70 miles and considerable time and makes the trip much less dangerous from New York to Boston . Ship canals within the islands along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts have been proposed lo make safe coast commerce . There is also talk of a ship canal from Chicago to the Gulf of Mexico by way of the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers ; and still another from Lake Eric to Pittsburgh . The Panama Canal. ? All present-day readers are familiar with the greatest of all ship canals , the Panama Canal , constructed by the Government at a cost of approxi78 Water Ways and Canals mately $400,000,000 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be remembered that a canal across the isthmus had been dreamed of practically ever since Balboa passed over and for the first time a white man saw the Pacific from the west coast of America . With the opening of the Oregon territory there was increased interest in such a canal . With the discovery of gold in California much traffic went by way of Panama being freighted across and transshipped on the other side . Soon a railroad was established for that purpose . Other crossings , too , were much in mind . In 1846 a treaty of amity and commerce was entered into with New Granada , afterwards the United States of Colombia , which gave the United States a right of way across the Isthmus by any available method . In return the United States agreed to guarantee the neutrality of the Isthmus . Great Britain had likewise long been interested in a canal scheme and courted Nicaragua . Also because of English settlements at Belize or British Honduras they claimed rights which had been confirmed by the treaty of Versailles in 1773 . Another route , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1848 a company of American citizens was formed for and began at once to construct a railway across the isthmus of Panama . Another contracted with the Nicaraguan government for a canal there . A treaty was made with Nicaragua whereby a concession was granted the company for the waterway , the United States guaranteeing the neutrality of the way as had been done with New Grenada . But the British government claimed control of the eastern terminus , therefore a treaty had to be negotiated with her . As a result the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty was signed and ratified in 1850 , whereby the United States and Great Britain agreed to join in promoting a canal by the Nicaraguan route promising that neither " would obtain or maintain for itself any exclusive control over the ship-canal , " nor , and here was the joker , " assume or exercise any dominion . . . over any part of Central America . " Neither was to acquire nor have any rights the other did not have and they both guarantee // the neutrality of the canal . This , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as it did allow a European nation a foothold upon this continent , and it was contrary to the Washingtonian policy of avoiding " entangling alliances . " However , it was considered at the time to be a victory for American diplomacy . But Great Britain retained her hold on Belize and some islands along the coast , and finally it was made known that before the signing of the treaty Sir Henry Buiwer had left with Clayton a memorandum to the effect that British renunciation in Central America should not apply to " Belize " or any of its " dependencies . " Greytown , a British trading post , had been established as a " free " city at the eastern terminus of the Nicaraguan route through British influence and support . In 1851 Greytown levied tribute upon the steamers of the transit company . One of these refused to pay and was fired upon by a British man-of-war , the fiction of Greytown being a " free city " apparently went glimmering . The situation was critical and for some time looked as though a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a state of trouble with the Greytown government . So bad was it that the United States vessel Cyane was called upon to protect the buildings of the Canal Company from destruction . Conditions remained strained , feelings ran high , until in 1854 one of the officers of a company steamer killed an individual and in a riot which followed the mob attacked the United States consul . Lieutenant Hollins , commanding officer of the Cyane , demanded reparation , and as this was not forthcoming he bombarded and destroyed the town . This accentuated the trouble between the United States and Great Britain but did not particularly enhance the building of the Nicaraguan canal . About this time Great Britain became involved in the Crimean War while in the United States the slavery question divided the country . Some hot-headed southerners wished forcibly to annex Nicaragua and filibusters // actually joined in some of the " revolutions " which are almost always in progress in Central American States with the idea of extending slave territory . ' Through one of these a man by the name of Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained a dictator . His rule was marked by severity and a series of acts that won him the enmity of the Central American States and also that of the Accessory Transit Company , whose charter and steamers he confiscated . He had secured the presidency and opened the stale to slavery ; he had also been able to get recognition at Washington . But another revolution broke out and he was driven out in 1857 . The action of Walker had destroyed American influence in Central America . i n the United States opinion was divided . Slavery enthusiasts openly advocated control of any transit route across the isthmus and that " no power on earth should be suffered to impede . " 10 This and numerous other troubles which followed , off and on inter-mittently , delayed and prevented canal construction . French Participation. ? After the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 by the French an organization of French scientists made a careful study of the various routes across the Isthmus and decided the one at Panama to be the most feasible . As a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suez Canal , began a careful survey of that route and in 1878 , Lucien Bonaparte Wyse , of the French Navy , se-cured from the United States of Colombia ( which had succeeded New Granada ) a concession giving a company to be organized by him exclusive right to construct a canal and railroad across the Isthmus of Panama . Neutrality was to be maintained and troops transported only by per-mission of Colombia . In return for this privilege and cer-tain grants of land Colombia was to receive 5 per cent of the gross tolls collected . The concession was for ninety-nine years and the canal was to be opened within eighteen // years . While it was claimed this concession did not con-flict with the treaty of 1846 between New Granada and the United States , nevertheless it provided that the latter might share in its advantages . The concession was transferred to De Lesseps , who arranged for an International Congress of Geographical Sciences , which assembled in Paris , May 15 , 1879 . The United States was one of the twenty-five nations there represented . Fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were considered feasible . Without going into detailed description some of these routes may be mentioned . The Tehauntepec route was 148 miles long and required 120 locks , would take about twelve days to pass a vessel through , and was in the region of earthquakes . The Nicaraguan Route was favored by many ? it was 180 miles long , needed 17 locks , but it re-quired an actual construction of only 60 miles as existing rivers and lakes could be utilized . A route from the Chiriqui Gulf to the Gulf Dulce , another from the Gulf of Darien by way of the Atrato and Napipi Rivers , and another into the San Miguel Bay , were discarded for various reasons . The choice centered upon the route from Colon to Panama by way of the Culebra pass and the Chagres River . This route , the shortest of all , was only 45 miles in length , but there were several disadvantages . The Chagres River must be diverted by a large dam or carried for miles in an aqueduct . A company ( Compagnie Universelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was claimed that further than granting the charter the French Government had nothing to do with t he canal . Stock could be owned by people of all nations , but the United States did not take kindly to the measure , although no formal action to prevent the construction of the canal was taken . Several promotion schemes were ad-vanced by private individuals to head off the French and Congress was petitioned for aid . Captain Fads , who by jetties had deepened the mouth of the Mississippi River , 8 2 Water Ways and Canals and an engineer of note , suggested a ship railway across the isthmus of Tehauntepec . A " Marine Canal Company of Nicaragua " wanted Congress to guarantee its capital stock ; another Nicaraguan company had Ex-President Grant as a sponsor . " The surveys made by the United States of the Panama and of the Atrato-Napipi routes in 1875 , were printed by order of Congress . In 1880 the House asked the president for the report of surveys made in 1872 and submitted in 1875 which had not yet become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time indignation was manifested in the United States against allowing a foreign country to gain a foothold even though by a neutral company on the Ameri-can continent . The Monroe Doctrine was brought out ; the Clayton-Bulwer treaty was presented ; the reports of Con-gressional Commissions were referred to as arguments against the De Lesse ps Canal . Various other complications entered , one of which was a possible conflict of authority if in case of a revolution on the Isthmus it were necessary to send troops by the United States to maintain the neutrality of the railroad and by France troops to maintain the neutrality of the canal . Sweeping aside these questions De Lesseps made prepa-ration to construct the canal , and landed a force of seventy engineers , superintendents and workmen on the Isthmus of Panama in 1881 . De Lesseps planned a tide-water canal which would require a cut of 285 feet in the Culebra pass . Difficulties encountered from slides in this cut and other reasons made it advisable afterwards to change the plans . De Lesseps purchased much machinery in Europe and America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the line of the Canal crossed it frequently and it could be utilized for transporting ma-terials , and began the operation of opening up the cut at various points along its course . The engineers estimated the cost at 843,000,000 francs ; this , De Lesseps cut to // 600,000,000 francs , and set the opening ceremonies for 1888 . During the Garfield administration Secretary of State Blaine held out for a strong American policy and informed Colombia , which was charged with making arrangements whereby certain European powers might assume joint guarantee over the canal , that " any movement in the sense or supplementing the guarantee contained ( in the treaty of 1846 ) would necessarily be regarded by this government as an uncalled for intrusion into a field where the local and general interest of the United States of America should be considered before those of any other power save those of Colombia alone . " 12 England claimed to be a new world power equally interested with the United States in maintaining the neutrality of the canal . Blaine proposed amending the Clayton-Bulwer treaty so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to annul that part ex ending it to any other practical routes so that the United States might be free to build a canal at Panama or else-where as it chose . Garfield 's death and Blaine 's retirement from the cabinet ended for the time being policies regard-ing South and Central Americas that would either have brought the United States in trouble with England or se-cured to her complete control of the canal and also , per-haps , much of South American trade . A treaty with Nicaragua allowing the construction of a canal wholly under American control , the United States guaranteeing the integrity of the territory of Nicaragua , which was un-doubtedly a violation of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty , and prepared by Frelinghuysen , Secretary of State under Arthur , for the purpose of testing that treaty , was with-drawn by President Cleveland who was inaugurated before its confirmation . There was a growing feeling that the De Lesseps com-pany would never finish the canal . The company had spent $10,000,000 more than the estimate of 600,000,000 francs ( $120,000,000 ) , and had not paid the $17,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bank-rupt . While a large amount of excavation had been done , it was small compared with what was necessary . A mag-nificent plant with much costly machinery was going to decay . The Spanish-American war brought forcibly to the atten-tion of the public the need of an interoceanic canal . In 1900 a treaty negotiated by John Hay and Sir Julian Pauncefote embodying some modifications of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty had been so amended in the Senate that Great Britain would not accept it . A new treaty made in view of the Senate amendments and the British objections was submitted a Pew months after Roosevelt became President . It abrogated parts of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty and gave to the United States full ownership and control of the proposed canal . Colonel Roosevelt had strongly advocated this while governor of New York before his accession lo the presidency.Y3 Two commissions in the past had reported favorably on the Nicaraguan route . A third commission with Admiral John G. Walker as chairman was appointed and authorized in 1.899 to expend a million dollars , if necessary , to make a thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported that the " Commission is of the opinion that the most practicable and feasible route for an Isthmian Canal , to be under the control , management , and owner-ship of the United States is that known as the Nicaraguan route . " Y4 The Commission placed the estimated cost of the Nicaraguan Canal at $189,864,062 ; of completing the Panama Canal at $144,233,358 ; and that to this latter sum should be added the cost of acquiring the rights of the French company . The company asked $109,141,500 , but the Commission estimated its worth at $40,000,000 . The company considered this unfair but finally offered to // negotiate with the United States and sell on the best terms possible . The Commission made a supplementary report recommending the Panama route and purchase of the French company 's work and rights at $40,000,000 . An act was signed by the president , June 28 , 1902 , which had passed Congress , not without opposition , authorizing the president to acquire control of the rights and property of the Panama Canal Company , to acquire perpetual control of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , across the Isthmus , to proceed as soon as these rights were acquired to construct a canal through " The Isthmian Canal Com-mission " created by the act ; but should he be unable to get satisfactory title to the property of the French company and the control of territory from Colombia , then the presi-dent was authorized to negotiate with Nicaragua and build a canal along the Nicaraguan route . Attorney General Knox reported that the French com-pany could give a clear title ; a convention was entered into by which the United States upon the payment of $10,000,000 in cash and an annual rental of $250,000 per year was to receive the necessary control and strip of land . The Senate ratified this March 17 , 1903 . When it went 10 the Colombian congress , however , it was rejected by unanimous vote . President Roosevelt declared Colombia wanted to wait until they could forfeit the title of the French company then sell to the United States for $40 , - 000,000.15 This view may and possibly was erroneous . There was again a demand that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1903 , the Panamanians , in-stigated by the French company , whose entire concession and undertaking would revert to Colombia in less than a year , " seeing their interests being sacrificed by the cupidity ( ) I ' Colombia , consummated a revolution . Many were of the ( ) pinion that the president of the United States was particeps criminis . In a letter to a friend 17 dated October // 10 , 1903 , he says , " I cast aside the proposition at this time to foment the secession of Panama . Whatever other gov-ernments can do , the United States can not go into the securing , by such underhand means , the cession . Privately , I freely say to you that I should be delighted if Panama were an independent state , or if it made itself so at this moment ; but for me to say so publicly would amount to an instigation of a revolt , and therefore I can not say it . " Many years later when chaffingly accused of being a wicked conspirator , Mr. Roosevelt is quoted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fellows in Paris and New York had taken all 1 he risk and were doing all the work . Instead of trying to run a parallel conspiracy , I had only to sit still and profit by their plot ? if it succeeded . " 18 The revolution was bloodless except for the accidental killing of a Chinaman and a dog . Colombia , however , as soon as possible sent troops to Colon . The following day the U. S. Ship Nashville landed fifty marines . The next day the Colombian troops left , said by some to have been bribed . A Panamanian government was formed ; on November 6th , the American consul was ordered from Washington to recognize it ; a week later their minister was formally received by President Roosevelt . On January 4 , 1904 , the president presented for ratification a treaty . The Senate ratified it February 23 , 1904 . Thus rapidly did things move . By this agreement the United States secured from the Republic of Panama a zone of land 10 miles wide for the canal with full power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence of the Panama republic , and agreed to pay $10,000,000 upon exchange of ratifications and the sum , beginning nine years thereafter , of $250,000 per annum . The Colombians protested and sent their former president General Reyes to Washington to persuade the Government to abrogate its compact with Panama . The counsel for Colombia is quoted as saying that " Reyes was authorized to accept $8,000,000 for all the desired eonWater // cessions and he would have taken $5,000,000 , but Hay and Roosevelt were so foolish they would n't accept . 113 Be that as it may , the effort was several times made to get for Colombia a gratuity much greater than Reyes would have accepted , and in 1921 Congress appropriated for that purpose $25 , - 000,000 , thus , in a way , acknowledging that Colombia was wronged and that the United States had been profited thereby . A commission was formed to undertake the construction of the canal . This was changed two or three times during the construction . The immensity of the work necessary to make a tidewater canal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused the abandonment of that plan . Three sets of locks were provided ? at Gatun , Pedro Miguel , and Miraflores . A great dam was built across the lower end of the Chagres , entirely blocking the flow of that river and creating a large artificial lake 165 square miles in area whose maximum height is 85 feet above sea water . This lake serves for storage water neces-sary to manipulate the canal and locks ; any surplus flows t hrough a spillway into the Pacific Ocean . Great break-waters were constructed to make smooth harbors at Colon and Panama and prevent silting . The canal is at sea level to Gatun , 8 miles , then three steps lead it to Gatun Lake ; it continues on that level for 32 miles ; then down one step at Pedro Miguel to Miraflores Lake , 55 feet above sea level ; thence through the Miraflores locks to sea level again and then out to deep water in the Pacific , 11 miles . The locks are 1000 feet long and large enough in every way to ac-commodate the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tunnels for filling , and mechanical means of operation are one of the seven wonders of the modern world . The cost was about $400,000,000 to date of opening . Since that time considerable sums have been spent in fortifications , improvements , and maintenance ? several large slides having occurred in the Culebra Cut . The " total amount expended or advanced to disbursing // officers for purchase , construction , fortification , etc. , to June 30 , 1919 , $452,075,376. " 20 The tolls amount to about $7,000,000 annually . The principal arguments in favor of the United States building the inter-oceanic canal were its utility as a meas-ure of preparedness for and strategy in case of war . By furnishing quick passage between the east and west coasts the navy necessary for the protection of these coasts could be reduced one hall ' . Witht lie canal entirely in the control of the Government no foreign nation could take advantage of it to our detriment . Notwithstanding the need of the canal for war purposes , the benefits to be derived by the commerce or peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation between the west and east coasts , and shortens materially the distance from the Atlantic s0aboard to western South America as well as to the islands of 1110 Pacific Ocean . During the year 1920 , " 2814 shills representing 11,236,119 tons of cargo , passed through the waterway " being a considerable increase over any preceding year . ' OI ' these 45.5 per cent were registered United States vessels , more than any other one nation . Fuel-oil , nitrates , steel and iron hold leading places in the line of commodities carried . River Transportation. ? As has already been stated streams and rivers were early adopted as a means for transportation . Birch-bark and dug-out canoes , flat-boats and keel-boats , with and without sails , and rafts were ex-tensively used . For small boats paddles and oars furnished the means of navigation , while several pairs of oars were utilized on the larger boats . In shallow water poling was much in vogue . Two men by pushing poles against the bottom of the stream from opposite sides of a small boat could easily propel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they pushed walked toward the stern as far as possible while the craft moved through the water under them . A third man held it with his pole until the first // two regained a position near the front for another push . By this arduous and crude means boats were propelled up shallow but often swift currents . On the larger rivers sails were employed . Going downstream offered little difficulty except to keep clear of sand bars and snags . Sails , oars , and poles were sometimes relied upon to assist the current in making speed . Large rafts of logs and lumber made by tying timbers together with wooden pins were floated down the rivers and broken up and sold when they reached their destination . Furs , hides , bacon , cured hams , or jerked-meat might form a cargo , stored during transit , in a small cabin erected at the center of the raft , which might occupy from 400 to 600 square feet . The construction of a practicable steamboat in 1807 by Robert Fulton 2 ' and another by John Stevens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigation . While many attempts had been made to utilize the steam engine I'or propelling boats , and some of them mechanically suc-cessful , Fulton 's was the first boat built and adapted for the conveyance of freight and passengers on a scale com-mercially successful . Fulton had had the confidence and backing of R. R. Livingston and the firm of Fulton &; Livingston was formed . This firm secured a monopoly for operating steam vessels in the waters of the state of New York . The first boat , the Clermont , named after Living-st on 's estate on the Hudson River , was 130 feet long , 18 feet beam , and 7 feet deep , with a burden of 160 tons . The Boulton &; Watt engine had been brought from England t lie year previous by Fulton and the boat built for it . The vessel made a successful trial trip to Albany , August 7 to ! - , and returned the following two days ; her running speed lead only averaged about 5 miles an hour , but she had demonstrated the practicability of steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stevens , who had been experimenting for years and , it is claimed , // had launched a screw propeller vessel driven by steam as early as 1804 , perfected his vessel , but because of Fulton &; Livingston 's monopoly took it to the Delaware River at Philadelphia . The trip around by sea demonstrated the feasibility of steam navigation on the ocean . Very shortly thereafter Fulton &; Livingston had placed a fleet of their vessels on the Hudson River and Long Island Sound , and had begun to build them at Pittsburgh while John Stevens &; Sons had their vessels on the Delaware and Connecticut Rivers . Soon all navigable waters were covered with steam propelled vessels . Prior to the introduction of the steamboat Mississippi River traffic had been , as has been stated , carried on by flat boats , rafts , and perhaps some twenty barges 23 of a better quality . These latter had been making one round trip a year requiring sixty days down and ninety days back from Louisville to New Orleans . This time , by 1822 , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By 1830 all the navigable tributaries of the Mississippi were traversed by steamboats and the produce of a western empire teeming through the portals was rapidly making New Orleans a groat city . The value of these commodities were given as approximating $26,000,000 annually.24 In 1860 a writer said : " upward of two hundred millions of dollars worth of merchandise are annually brought to this market . " 25 New Orleans was an extremely busy place with all the picturesqueness of pioneer cities generally . Rank-ing twelfth of the cities of the United States in 1790 , it had steadily climbed up to third place in 1840,26 when the northern cities through the influence of the railroads and the decline of river traffic began to outstrip it . The levee , an embankment along the river , several feet higher than the city , was bordered by a long line of warehouses on the land side and by quays extending into the river on the // other side . Miles of ships , boats , and barges were anchored along the levee as automobiles are now parked along a street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The New Orleans levee is one continuous landing-place , or quay , 4 miles in extent , and of an average width of 100 feet . It is 15 feet above low water mark , and 6 feet above the level of the city , to which it is graduated by an easy descent . During the business season , from November to July , the river front of the levee is crowded with vessels , of all sizes and from all quarters of the world , with hundreds of large and splendid steamboats , barges , flat-boats , etc . The levee presents a most busy and animated prospect . Here are seen piles of cotton bales , vast numbers of barrels of pork , flour and liquors of various kinds , bales of foreign and domestic manufactures , hogsheads of sugar , crates of ware , etc. , draymen with their carts , buyers , sellers , laborers , etc . Valuable products from the head waters of the Missouri , 3000 miles distant , center here . The Illinois , the Ohio , the Arkansas and Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this commercial depot . Under the influence of the river traffic many other cities were springing into importance . Many of these later be-came centers of railroad activity and thus retained or even bettered their rank . Others gradually wasted away until they are mere hamlets to-day . The times seem to have been ripe when Fulton 's Clermont appeared , for almost immediately the steamboat industry thrived . During the first ten years 131 steam vessels had been built and by 1832 , 474 ; 27 in 1836 and 1837 , 145 and 158 respectively were launched . Building was for a few years checked by business depression but soon revived and in 1846 there were constructed 225 steam vessels . The Civil War reduced the number ; immediately following business sprang up again and taking into account coasts , rivers , and lakes has continued brisk ever since . With the growth in the number of vessels , up until rail-roads began to monopolize travel and freightthe accom92 Water Ways and Canals modations and speed were continually improved until river and sound boats were frequently spoken of as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred passengers , with staterooms , saloons , dining rooms , bathrooms , barber shops , and other features . The river steamboat may be said to be a development of the pole-boat or flat-boat . On account of the shoals they must be broad and shallow . The paddle wheels on the sides are operated independently in order to facilitate quick turning . The weight of engines , boilers , fuel bunkers , freight and passenger burden , are distributed fairly well over the entire surface . Some of the best lower Mississippi boats had a length of hull of 300 feet , a width of 50 feet and depth of hold of 9 feet . The boat fully loaded drew about 10 feet of water , when light , 4 feet . " Mark twain , " 6 feet , represented the shallowest water the vessels piloted by Samuel L. Clemens could navigate ; after quitting steam-boating he adopted that term for a nom-dc-plume , under which his inimitable writings were published.28 The main deck overhangs the hull and is about 90 feet wide . A complete system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffness . Modern boats are electric lighted and have swinging gangplanks , capstans , and all the recent power improvements for the rapid handling of freight and passengers . The staterooms are erected on the saloon deck with doors opening into the saloon and on a narrow passageway along the outside . The saloon generally ex-tends the full length of the house , giving a large well-lighted room , used as a lounging and dining room . Above this is another deck on which are officers ' quarters and above all fully glassed in is the pilot house . The freight capacity of these boats is given as 1500 tons , and there are 70 state-rooms to accommodate 140 passengers . Deck passage could be provided for a number more . The cost of a " floating palace " was in the ' eighties from $100,000 to $120,000 . Extremely handsome , well equipped , and finely decorated boats ply regularly on the Hudson River and on Long // Island Sound . Some of the vessels of one line are over 400 feet long and 50 feet wide . The decks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state rooms ; many of them are magnificently equipped . O'Hanlon 's " Irish Emigrants ' Guide to the United States , " published in 1851 , would indicate that all travel-ing in that day was not as comfortable as might be inferred from the preceding . With regard to steamboats it says : These have been termed " flying palaces , " and many of them are fitted up in style of great magnificence . But the comfort of traveling by them is confined to cabin passengers , state rooms , accommodating two persons each , in separate berths , are appro-priated for retirement by day and for rest at night ; ladies and gentlemen have separate cabins , but dine at the same table , which is set out in the " social hall , " and stocked with a variety of luxuries . . . The deck passengers are immediately under the cabin , and in the hinder part of the boat . A few berths are fitted up for their reception without bedding . Provisions must be provided at their own expense , and also a mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board without having room to move , or stretch them-selves out for rest ; the inconvenience of this mode of traveling can hardly be appreciated without being experienced . It is also stated that steamboat traveling was dangerous because of the explosions . It is true there were a number of boiler explosions . Mark Twain mentions one of the very worst , 2 " the explosion of the Pennsylvania . He also dis-cusses the subject of racing , which after the Government rules regarding steam pressure went into effect , he claims not to have been dangerous . One of the later races , that between the Robert E. Lee and the Natchez in 1870 was an event of national interest . The time of the Robert E. Lee from New Orleans to St. Louis was 3 days 18 hours and 14 minutes from dock to dock . Mark Twain claims the fastest long-distance running was made by the Eclipse in 1855 when she made the trip from New Orleans to Cairo at an average speed " a shade under fourteen and three-eighths miles per hour . " // An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight traffic on steam-boats may be obtained from the following . In 1816 from New York to Albany the fare was $7 , about 4 cents per mile . For way stations between about Z cents per mile , but no charge less than $1.30 In 1817 from Rhode Island to New York , $10 , approximately 5 cents per mile . The Government 's Attitude Toward River Improvement. ? The individual states had been encouraging turnpikes , canals , and other interior improvements by subscribing and underwriting stock in private coin panics authorized to build and operate the improvements . Frequently monopolies were granted to operating companies.31 States // were jealous of each other and hesitated to appropriate money for improvements which would inure to the benefit of another state , and frequently an improvement in one state was worthless unless joining improvements could be made in neighboring states . Many men , believing in a large and unified nation rather than a confederation of several small nations advocated governmental action . Strict con-stitutionalists and states ' rights men objected . President Madison had vetoed Calhoun 's Bonus Bill for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not vest Congress with power to undertake such improvements.32 Calhoun had used all the power of his great eloquence based upon the " common defense and general welfare " clause of the constitution in favor of such improvements . He con-sidered it the duty of Congress to " bind the republic to-gether with a perfect system of roads and canals . " He ex-claimed that the very extent of the country " exposes us to the greatest of all calamities , ? next to the loss of liberty , ? and even to that in its consequences ? disunion . We are great , and rapidly ? I was about to say fearfully growing . This is our pride and our danger ; our weakness and our strength . We are under the most imperious obligation to counteract every tendency to disunion . . . . Whatever im-pedes the intercourse of the extremes with this , the center of the Republic , weakens the Union ! ' " Monroe 's first message indicated that he followed Madison in the belief that Congress was not empowered by the constitution to establish internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president to erect toll houses along the Cumberland Road , appoint toll gatherers and otherwise regulate its use , on the ground that it exceeded the power of congress . He favored internal // improvements but thought a constitutional amendment necessary . ' 34 The next year , however , some bills for internal improve-ments got through among them the first act for the im-provement of harbors . In 1802 , under the influence of Gallatin , Randolph and Jefferson , 5 per cent of the Ohio lands sold were appropriated for the building of roads . " In 1809 was passed the first act for river improvement . " These were the beginnings of National aid for internal improvements in the United States . The " implied powers " adherents seem to have been in the ascendency for a report of the treasurer shows that up to 1830 the United States had appropriated for internal improvements ? Cumberland Road , $2,443,420.20 ; subscriptions to canal stock and im-provements of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers , $1,263 , - 315.65 ; for other items such as building of piers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river obstructions , $1,603,694.31 . It was pointed out that only $234,955.92 ' had been expended in the territories where the question of constitutionality ( lid not arise . Presidents had nearly always declared in favor of internal improve-ments but desired that constitut ional provision be made for the same . Jackson , a strong state sovereignty man , sug-gested that the surplus funds of the ( , overnment be dis-tributed among the several states in proportion to their representation in Congress ; and in 1830 vetoed a bill for subscription to the stock of one canal and pocketed others , and closed his administration by pocketing a bill for the improvement of the Wabash River . While Jackson 's attitude checked federal appropriations , especially for roads and canals , those for rivers and harbors became al-most a national scandal , and were with other public ap-propriation bills frequently referred to as " pork bills . " A congressional appropriation , whether for rivers and harWater // hors , a federal building , or an irrigation project , brought considerable money into a state ; it was considered a feather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reelection . Consequently nearly every congressman intro-duced such an act for his district and " log-rolling " schemes were entered into by many to procure their passage . River and harbor appropriations continued to in-crease until 1882 , when they amounted to the vast sum of $18,743,875 to be applied to some 500 different localities . President Arthur3s vetoed the bill , but Congress passed it over the veto and the " barrel of pork " was divided up as usual . The publicity given the matter checked appropria-tions for a while but they soon climbed higher than ever . The appropriation for the fiscal year of 1920 was $33,378. - 364.39 CHAPTER IV RAILROADS During the period of the development of the canals there was growing up along side of them an agency for transportation that was destined practically to put them out of business . Engineers in both Europe and America were straining every energy to apply the steam engine to the propulsion of wagons along a highway . No one at first looked upon the railroad as a separate and distinct industry . For years upon roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been placed in the tracks to prevent rutting . These planks had developed into rigidly set timbers or rails either attached to cross timbers or to stones set in the roadway . A little later iron straps were fastened to the tops of the rails to lessen wear and friction . It was found that a horse could haul on these tramways several times as much as he could on the dirt roadway . ' The steam engine had revolutionized industry and was turning all sorts of machinery with an efficiency unknown before , why then could it not be applied to propel vehicles ? In England George Stephenson and associates were proving that it could . But prior to their time many thinkers of America believed in it . John Fitch , the half crazy inventor of an early steamboat , had built a model locomotive . Oliver Evans , who had placed wheels under a steamboat of his invention ( 1804 ) and run it over the streets of Philadelphia , predicted " The time will come when people will travel in stages moved by steam engines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds fly , fifteen to twenty miles an hour . " His vision went still further ; he saw what most people think to be absolutely modern 99 // innovations : " A carriage will set out from Washington in the morning , the passengers will breakfast at Balti-more , dine at Philadelphia , and sup at New York , the same day . . . and travel by night as well as by day ; and the passengers will sleep in these stages as comfortably as they do now in steamboats. ' 1 Evans antedated Stephen-son 's thought that speed with a locomotive could only be made on nearly level rails . John Stevens , who is often spoken of as the father or American railroads , of course , had similar belief 's , and wrote a pamphlet to impress his ideas of the importance or railways upon Congress . He said : " I am anxious and ambitious that my native country should have t he honor of being the first to intro-duce an improvement of such immense importance to society at large , and should reel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first in-stance . " IIad Congress not turned a deaf ear to him it is quite possible that he might have been before Stephenson in demonstrating the practicability of ' the locomotive . ' Stevens built a small locomotive and demonstrated it on a piece of track on his grounds with himself ' as passenger in 1820 . Several tramways or railroads operated by horse were established in different parts of the country . One of them ? sponsored by the people of Baltimore , anxious to retain their trade ? was the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad , which had secured from Maryland , Virginia , and Pennsyl-vania charters for its construction in 1827 and 1828 . It was being built with many curves , as it , too , was expected to have horse propulsion . Many persons thought it should be made straighter in order to take advantage of the steam locomotive when the inventors had perfected it sufficiently to be usable . It was not considered feasible to operate locomotives on crooked roads . Peter Cooper , justly praised for many benefits to his country , decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run on a crooked track . In his own words : " Under these discouraging circumstances many of the principal stockholders were about to abandon the work , and were only prevented from forfeiting their stock by my persuading them that a locomotive could be so made as to pass successfully around the short curves then found in the road . " 4 Accordingly in 1829 Cooper fitted up a small engine and boiler on a fiat car and with that crude locomotive , the Tom Thumb , was able to demonstrate that curves could be " navigated . " Having made some changes in the Tom Thumb , Cooper , the next year , ran it over the 13 miles from Baltimore to Ellicott 's Mills in an hour and a quarter , an average of 6 miles per hour , returning in sixty-one minutes , including a stop of four minutes . The engine pushed ahead of it a flat car carrying twenty-four passengers . The wheels of the engine had been constructed on the " cone principle " which allowed it to round the curves of 400 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with passengers had been hauled over a railroad in the United States by means of steam power . In England steam engines had been tried out but not until 1820 was the first commercial road , the Stockton &; Darlington Railroad , 37 miles in length , completed . Prior to this time the tram roads had been erected for special-ized private transportation ( from colliery to canal , for in-stance ) or as improvements to the public highways . The Stockton &; Darlington was intended to be operated with horses . And even as late as 1828 the Liverpool &; Man-chester Railroad , intended primarily to haul freight and relieve the congested condition of the canals , was chartered with a provision that the owners could exact toll of all who might put vehicles on the road for the transport of goods . The engineer , George Stephenson , however , was a strong // advocate of steam power and the success of the Rocket , built by his son Robert , in 1829 , as this road was nearing completion , definitely determined the power to be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were public highways . In Pennsylvania the state built a rail-road from Philadelphia to Columbia and licensed over twenty different companies to run their horse-drawn cars over it . ' In other states the same idea prevailed and the right to charge tolls " upon all passengers and property " transported upon the road was legalized by the charter . The utility and economy of the railways were so manifest that organizations were formed rapidly over the whole well settled portions of the country . Several locomotives were imported from England . One of these , the John Bull ( locomotives were for a number of years all named like sleeping cars are now ) , brought over by Stevens &; Son , is said to have given Baldwin information which enabled him to build Old Ironsides , the first locomotive to run on Pennsylvania tracks , and establish a business which after-wards became one of the largest locomotive works in the world . Old Ironsidcs was built by Matthias Baldwin and his brother-in-law Rufus Tyler for the Philadelphia , Germantown &; Norristown Road . Tyler seems to have made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical ingenuity had carried him further . He had added to his business that of constructing tools and calico printing apparatus and machinery . He had built a steam engine for his own shop . A museum operator in Phila-delphia desiring to add to the attractions of his place of amusement wished to put in a miniature locomotive and railway . He applied to Baldwin , who built the road with its small locomotive and cars . On April 25 , 1831 , its in-stallation was completed and it hauled two four-seated passenger cars about a circular track , to the great delight of the patrons , who were anxious for the experience of riding on the railroad . One of the roads that seems to have been prolific in // " first things " was between Charleston and Hamburg , South Carolina . Chartered in 1827 , again in 1828 . In 1829-30 it experimented with sailing cars , as did also the Baltimore &; Ohio and with treadmill horse powers . But the company fortunately employed Horatio Allen , who had studied the English roads and was strongly inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was decided to strengthen construction and use such locomotives . This then , very likely , was the first railroad in the world to adopt formally the steam locomotive as its means of propulsion ( January 14 , 1830 ) . The company accordingly built its lines substantially and placed upon them the " first locomotive made in America for regular and practical use on a railway . " 7 This locomotive known as the Best Friend of Charleston was built in New York and shipped to Charleston by sea . After some adjustments it satisfied the demands of the contract , but distinguished itself by being the first locomotive to explode . It is said a negro fireman sat upon or held down the safety valve to prevent escaping steam from annoying him . The Charles-ton Courier 's account closes with the gratifying informa-tion that " none of the persons are dangerously injured ex-cept the negro , who had his thigh broken . " A new loco-motive , the West Point , was secured , upon which several improvements suggested by experience had been made ; among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireman , making it fool-proof . The beginning of the New York Central may be traced to a charter granted in 1826 to the Mohawk &; Hudson Company , which with five or six other small lines was joined together into that company . Its first locomotive , the De Witt Clinton , had a rather interesting initiation . The engine was constructed by the West Point foundry , the same concern that had built the Best Friend and the West Point . A demonstration was announced for August 9 , 1831 , the road having 17 miles of rails at that time . The locomotive , a small affair compared with the modern // engines , is still in existence and with its train of that day was exhibited at the Pageant of Progress , Chicago , July 30 , 1921 , as the " pioneer American steam passenger train . " The whole engine was only about 12 feet long with large wheels , tall smoke stack and a central steam dome . Back of it were the tender and wood for fuel and two barrels of water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these several small flat cars to which had been attached temporary benches for seats . The locomotive and cars were joined together with short sections of strong chain . When the engine started these jerked so badly the passengers could not retain their seats ; stopping had a similar effect . On the trip it is said the passengers appro-priated rails from a near fence and made braces to keep the cars the full length of the chains apart . The wood fuel produced many sparks which flying backward set fire to and ruined much of the passengers ' clothing . But accord-ing to a newspaper report ' the train " passed over the road from plane to plane , to the delight of a large crowd assembled to witness the performance . The engine per-formed the entire route in less than one hour , including stoppages , and on a part of the road its speed was at the rate of 30 miles an hour . " On May 10 , 1893 , Engine No. 999 , of the New York Central Railroad , made , traveling alone , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amboy road was chartered in 1830 and was somewhat unique in that New Jersey in return for $200,000 worth of stock had granted a monopoly of the right of way between Philadelphia and Newark . Poore says:9 " The state became a willing party to the scheme , under the idea that it could thereby draw the means for supporting its government from citizens of other States , thus relieving its own from the burdens of taxation . " He says , " the state now ( 1860 ) derives a revenue of over // $200,000 annually from transit duties and dividends on the stock presented to it . " New England started three railway projects about the same time : Boston &; Lowell , chartered in 1830 first used in 1834 , 26.7 miles long ; Boston &; Providence , chartered in 1831 , first used in 1834 , 43.5 miles long ; and the Boston &; Worcester , chartered in 1831 , first used in 1834 , 44.6 miles long.10 These roads were chartered with the idea of using horse-drawn vehicles , except the Boston &; Worcester , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 1834 that they were used . Some of these roads , as did most of those built farther west , followed the English practice of laying track . One of them , at least , laid its track upon wooden cross-ties , thus securing the necessary resiliency for service . It was not many years , however , before several other roads were established with regular trips of locomotive drawn cars arranged both for passenger and freight traffic . The time of passenger service from Boston to New York had been materially shortened by connecting the schedules of stage coaches to Providence with those of steamboats down the Sound . When the steam railway came into existence the time of the trip was again shortened , and still again when an all rail route was opened in 1848 , as shown by the following table : 1775 General Washington was 12 days en route . Early coaches required a week . 1800 Stage coaches required 4 days . 1832 Stage coaches required 41 hours . 1822 Coach to Providence , steamboat to New York , 28 hours . 1835 Coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1835 Railway to Providence , steamboat to New York , 15 hours . 1848 All railway , 10 hours . 1922 All railway , 5 hours , 10 minutes . 1922 Air plane , 3 hours . While the railroads of the East were gradually working west , the trans-Alleghany states were themselves looking toward railroad transportation . The first railway in Ohio was begun in 1835 and had completed 30 miles by 1840 . It // extended from Sandusky to Springfield . When it was chartered , 1832 , under the name of the Mad River &; Lake Erie Railway , the intention was to connect Lake Erie with the Ohio River . A locomotive was purchased and shipped to Sandusky by canal and lake . It arrived be-fore any track was laid hence the gauge of the track was made to fit the locomotive , 4 feet 10 inches . Other roads in Ohio were laid at that gauge and in time the state adopted that as a standard . Michigan in 1832 , then a territory , incorporated the Detroit &; St. Joseph Railroad Company . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann Arbor in 1810 . Later its western terminal became New Buffalo , from which point there was steamboat com-munication with Chicago . This was the germ which has grown into the Michigan Central . A railroad was begun from Frankfort , Kentucky , to Lexington , a few miles from the pioneer settlement at Boonesborough . By 1840 this road had extended to the Ohio River near Louisville and was 92 miles in length . Indiana chartered not less than a half-dozen railways in 1832 and continued with a score or more in the next few years . The Lawrenceburg &; Indianapolis line , chartered 1832 , was opened with a Fourth of July celebration , 1834 , and had laid less than 2 miles of track by 1836 . " The Madi-son &; Indianapolis road was opened in 1838 . The report of the principal engineer , 1837 , states that " the exclusive use of steam as a motive power " had been adopted , thus saving " the cost of a horse path " and avoiding " the delay and confusion arising from the simultaneous use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevating the " character of the road by greater dispatch in the conveyance of passengers . " He thinks " in the use of the railroads con-structed by the state it will probably be best for the state to furnish the motive power , leaving the cars for the conveyance of freight and passengers to be fur-nished by individuals or companies , from whom the // state will exact the proper toll for the use of the road , and for the motive power . " The idea seems everywhere to have prevailed that a railway was a public highway to be used by and for the benefit of the public . Only for a very short time in the history of the country did the theory have prominence that a railway is private property to the extent that its owners could do as they pleased with it and the " public be damned . " At various points in the South were railways projected and built . Besides the Charleston &; Hamburg , which has already been mentioned , and which by 1850 had extended across the state to Hamburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and northward to Columbia with some branches , should be noted a few others . From Richmond there was a line westward to the coal fields ( 1830-31 ) and a line which by 1840 connected the Potomac with Fredericksburg , a distance of 75 miles . It was constructed in the ordinary manner of wooden rails with strapiron plates . In Virginia there were the Petersburg &; Roanoke , about 60 miles long and other lines sufficient to total in 1840 more than 300 miles . North Carolina also took up the rail question rather early . The Wilmington &; Raleigh , chartered in 1833 , had laid upwards of 160 miles in 1840 . Georgia was building lines in the ' thirties and ' forties from Augusta across the state to link with lines in Tennessee . The lines of these several Southeastern states were joined together later and became parts of large systems . Of the several projects authorized amounting to more than 1000 miles ( 1837 ) only one materialized , namely , the road from Springfield to Meredosia , and 58 miles had been completed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springfield Journal , March 18 , " the cars ran from Jacksonville , 33 ? miles , in two hours and eight minutes including stoppages . " On account of the unsettled condition of the country and the accidents along the way , ? no doubt the track was poorly constructed , ? it did not pay . The locomotive for a considerable time lay out in the open where it had jumped the track . A man bought it , // equipped it with wide tired wheels and attempted to operate it on the wagon roads . This proved unsuccessful and it was finally abandoned on the prairie.12 The road was sold in 1847 . Several roads were reaching out for the Mississippi River and the fertile prairies beyond . The bustling young city of Chicago began its first railway toward the west in 1848 . The other extremity was set for Galena on the Mississippi River . Not being financially able to buy T-rails they purchased some second-hand strapirons . Likewise a second-hand locomotive was obtained , but when it arrived at the water front in Chicago the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street the company was at a loss to know how to get it to the end of their rails . After much discussion permission to lay a temporary track was given , and the Pioneer finally reached her destination . The railway proved successful from the first ; later it became part of the Illinois Central System . The locomotive Pioneer is still retained in the Field Museum of Chicago . There is not space to trace the development of the railways in all the individual states . In all natural growths , increases at first are slow , then accelerated until a maximum is reached , followed by a gradual retardation . So with the railway growth . The number of miles of railroad constructed up to 1830 was 41 ; 1835 , 918 ; to 1840 , 2797 ; in small widely scattered locations , but from that time on to the Civil War the work went on rapidly , By 1860 about 31,000 miles had been constructed and was going on at the rate of 5000 miles per year . Seven trunk line roads had passed through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections touched the Ohio River , and the Mississippi at ten. * By 1850 there was railway connection between Boston and the east end of Lake Erie , and from the west end of Lake Erie to Lake Michigan with steamboat connection across the two lakes ; before 1860 there was a network of rails between the Atlantic seaboard and the Mississippi River . Construction " Potter 's American Monthly , July , 1879. * T. C. Smith , American Nation , Vol . XVIII , p. 60. // lagged behind in the South . Up to 1856 the building was approximately as follows : // mental aid . Land was then plenty and the general belief was that the prosperity of the country demanded its settle-ment . If railways could be induced to go out into the open prairies and by their selling agencies bring about the occupation and tillage of these lands , other lands owned by the Gov-ernment would soon be in demand . There would be no par-ticular hardship on anyone , since Government land was sold to actual settlers for such a small sum , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much larger price . As a matter of fact the land was sold by the rail-roads for whatever it would bring ; the prices increased as settlement became more dense . In Iowa railroad land sold from $5 to $50 per acre during the ' sixties and ' seventies . The remaining land held by the government was ordinarily increased in price from $1.25 to $2.50 per acre . Congress , evidently influenced by the demand for rail-roads , and falling back upon the precedent of the National Highway , heretofore mentioned , granted in 1850 to the State of Illinois a strip of land about 12 miles wide length-wise through the state to be transferred by it to the Illinois Central Railroad . The act gave six sections per mile on each side of the track , amounting , as certified to later , 2,595,053 acres . In consideration of this and in lieu of all other taxes , the company agreed to pay the state an amount equal to 7 per cent of the gross earnings from freight and passenger traffic . The company had received from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up to January 1 , 1873 , $24,296,596 ; 13 an average of about $11 per acre . Other companies were quick to take advantage of this precedent . Each had its representative in Congress . For over twenty years there was scarcely a Congress that did not make one or two such grants . More than a hun-dred such grants 14 were made between 1850 and 1872 , // aggregating 155,000,000 acres . ' 5 Several roads did not comply with the conditions of the grants hence the donation lapsed . Up to June 30 , 1880 , grants amounted to 155 , - 504,994.59 acres , according to Donaldson , of which there had been patented to the same date , 35,214,978.25 acres . Pacific Roads. ? The most gigantic land grants made by the Government were for the benefit of the trans-con-tinental or Pacific roads . The idea of a transcontinental railroad has been traced back practically to the beginning of railroad building in the United States.ls During the ' fifties the debates in Congress waxed strong . Should the states ' sovereignty idea prevail and federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by them to the builders as had been done with the Illinois Central and numerous other cases , or should the National Government undertake the work itself or grant the aid to a company for that pur-pose ? Where would the road be built : in the North , which would give an advantage to the abolitionists , or in the South , with corresponding advantage to slavery partisans ? The two classes were absolutely antagonistic to each other 's desires . Then there was a middle class , who desired to prevent separation and war who refused to vote upon either side for fear it would create trouble with the other . As a compromise a bill was passed in 1853 to have the country west of the Mississippi River surveyed to determine the most feasible region for building the transcontinental railroad . The report of the survey is contained in eleven volumes , and was made by the War Department , of which Jefferson Davis was the Secretary . This cabinet officer reported in favor of " the route of the 32d parallel " as the " most practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocean . " 17 A line this far south , of course , was not acceptable to the North . The election and Civil War coming on changed the status of affairs and on July 4 , 1862 , President Lincoln signed the bill by which the first transcontinental road should be constructed by two com-panies : the Central Pacific working from the west , and the Union Pacific working from the Missouri River at Omaha westward . A grant or land of approximately 35,000,000 acres was made , namely , the odd sections lying contiguous to the line on either side . This was not quite a return to the position of the Government when it built out of the funds from the sale of public lands the National Road westward from Maryland , through Pennsylvania , Ohio , Indiana , into Illinois . Then the construction was done under the direc-tion of the federal Government and the road remained the property of the Government . Now federal aid was given to private companies to be operated for their own benefit . What might have been the result in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownership is problematical , but the fact that it has made a success of the construction and operation of the Panama Canal leads many to believe that the railroad question would have been handled as easily if that system had grown up from the beginning . Opponents of government ownership point to the roads of continental Europe as being less efficient than those of England and the United States under private ownership . And more recently the fiasco of Government operation under war emergency is considered a strong argument against public ownership . In addition to the land granted to the Union Pacific for the " purpose of aiding in the construction of said railroad and telegraph line , and to secure the safe and speedy trans-portation of the mails , troops , munitions of war , and public stores thereon , every alternate section of land , designated by odd numbers , to the amount of five alternate sections per mile on each side of said road , " 18 the company // was given for " right of way " 200 feet each side of the track , 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and various other purposes enumerated , also to take from the public land " adjacent to the line of said road " ( afterwards limited to 10 miles on each side ) " earth , stone , timber , and other materials , for the con-struction thereof . " Further help was also granted by the provisions of the act ( Section 5 ) : " That . . . the Secre-tary of the Treasury shall , upon the certificate in writing . . . of the completion and equipment of forty consecutive miles . . . issue ... bonds of the United States of one thousand dollars each , payable in thirty years after date , bearing six per centum per annum interest . . . to the amount of sixteen of said bonds per mile . " The act provides that this loan shall constitute a first mortgage lien on the property , but the act of 1864 allowed the company to issue bonds to the same amount and subrogate the Government bonds to those issued by the company making the Government claim a second mortgage instead of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Central Pacific , although it was a purely state corporation and , at first , was only to build to the east line of California . Apparently the last vestige of the traditions of Madison and Monroe , of Jackson and Buchanan had disappeared . There was danger that other lines would be built . A line was preparing to go west from Leavenworth , lines were converging on St. Joseph and Sioux City , any of which might become rivals of the Union Pacific , so the act provides that they shall unite with the Pacific not farther west than the one hundredth meridian of longitude , and if they do so grants of lands and subsidy bonds will be given to them . However , the demand for transcontinental lines was so great that three other lines were authorized . In 1864 the Northern Pacific Railroad to connect Lake Superior with // Puget Sound , with a land grant of 58,000,000 acres ; in the Atlantic &; Pacific to follow the old 132d parallel route , now a part of the Southern Pacific , with a grant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Santa Fe received also a large grant . The total Congressional grants certified or patented to railroads and military wagon roads from 1850 to 1880 were as follows : Construction of Pacific Roads. ? It would be interesting to take up in detail the work of constructing these roads , but space will not permit . Nothing can be said of the intense.interest throughout the United States ; of the romance and adventure of penetrating 1700 miles of wilderness and desert with hostile Indians ready at any time to attack ; with worse than hostile Indians in the rough-necks , gamblers , and prostitutes who followed the camps ; of the magnitude of the work employing 2000 graders to go first , 1500 wood choppers and tie-getters spreading their labors over thousands of miles of Government forests ; of the engineers and their feats of searching out easiest passages ; of the track layers ; of the boarding houses ; of general camp life ; of the exciting race with the Central Pacific ending in the union of the two lines and the driving of the golden spike at Promontory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1086 miles westward from Omaha and 689 miles eastward from Sacramento , on the 10th day o.f May , 1869 ; and of the crowds in Omaha , Chicago , Cincinnati , New Orleans , Washington , New York , San Francisco , and every other place of importance in the whole nation , who patiently // waited the sounds of the bells rung in unison with the sounds of the strokes upon the spike , transmitted instan-taneously through the intervening space by the electric telegraph . There is no doubt but that the benefits that have come from the railways through the increased facilities for trans-portation and the corresponding gain to civilization has amply repaid the Government for all its bounties , notwith-standing some of them were unnecessary , in fact , a willful waste and led to an orgy of financial and political corrup-tion a little later . The Credit Mobilier. ? Perhaps the most widely noticed scandal connected with the railroads was the scheme known as the Credit Mobilier . This was made much of by the Grange and other anti-monopoly movements which reached their height in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressmen had been bribed by an organiza-tion known as the Credit Mobilier , a Congressional investi-gation was made , 20 Thomas Durant , vice president. , and other leading stockholders of the Union Pacific Railroad , secured a controlling interest in the stock of the Pennsyl-vania Fiscal Agency in 1864 and had its name changed to the Credit Mobilier of America . One of the ostensible functions of the company was to loan money for railroad construction . The same men were instrumental in award-ing the contract for the building of the Union Pacific Rail-road to one of their number , Oakes Ames , a member of the United States House of Representatives , for stipulated amounts per mile for the different sections ranging from $42,000 to $96,000 , amounting in the aggregate to $47,000 , - 000 . The contract was right away transferred to seven trustees composed of the same controlling stockholders , who were to execute it receiving therefor $3000 per year each , and the profits were to be divided among those stock-holders of the Credit Mobilier of America who would comply with certain conditions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent per annum and 21/2 per cent commission , not to exceed the // amount provided in the contract to be paid by the Union Pacific company . These same leading stockholders of the Union Pacific being also controlling stockholders of the Credit Mobilier were thus , because the contract prices were said to be twice the actual constructing prices , making a big profit , practically all of which was coming from the United States treasury . Complaints were being made and adverse legislation was feared . Stock in Credit Mobilier was offered to rncmbers of congress at a very low figure on which it is said they made dividends of 340 per cent . It amounted to this : The men entrusted with the management of the road let , the contract for its construction to . themselves at a figure double its real cost , and pocketed the profits , estimated at about , x ; 30,000,000 . These same men started the scheme , whirls afterward became common , of watering the stork , that , is increasing the outstanding stock , and distribute ig it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased without any new outlay of money . It also appears to be a method of earning dividends upon money never invested . Railroad Consolidation. ? It ; has been shown that at the beginning railroad building consisted of short stretches from town to town , or from the end of one water communication to the beginning of another . It was but reasonable that these would join for the purpose of through traffic . The result was also better efficiency as the equipment could be used to better advantage ; the terminal costs were reduced as there were not so many of them ; and , what may have been a leading cause , the control , and perhaps prevention , of competition . Unrestricted competition caused rate wars ; rates once down it was difficult to get them back and frequently bankruptcy occurred . Government regulations were made prohibiting rate agreements and pooling . Such apparently hastened consolidation . One objection to consolidation was the concentration of vast financial powers in the hands of a few , and since money had much influence in Washington and in the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other industrial concerns were causes which brought about the // enactment of the Sherman Anti-Trust law of July 2 , 1890.21 This law did not come in time to stop consolidation and it may be doubtful if it would for the Supreme Court has de-cided that combinations are not unlawful unless they exercise an unreasonable restraint upon trade . " The methods of consolidation are : merger or outright purchase , in which case the individual lines lose their separate identity ; stock purchase , wherein a controlling share of the stock of another road is held by the purchas-ing line or by a holding company ; lease usually for long periods , a rental being paid periodically for the use of the line ; and , community of interest , that is the establishment of friendly relations . The consolidations are more often financial than physical . When two roads physically com-bine under one management it is customary to reorganize and assume the same name . In the consolidations given in the table below many of the roads are operated separately and almost independently but are dominated by common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the principal consolidations prior to 1912 are:23 // Mechanical Development. ? There is not space to follow in detail the mechanical development of railroads . The rail , for instance , was at first a mere plank placed in the cart track to prevent rutting ; this evolved into a rail of timber about 4 x 6 inches held in proper position by crossties not to be considered as sleepers or supports especially . On top of the rail was later placed a strap iron . Since this strap iron under the wheel loads curled up , thicker plates began to be used . Then cast-iron rails some 4 or 5 feet long from tie to tie , cast deeper at the middle for greater strength . Then the rolling mills were becoming sufficiently improved to roll out wrought-iron rails , at first rectangular plates , then T-rails held up by chairs and finally through a dozen or more forms to Bessemer , then open-hearth steel rail shapes as at present used . The fastenings and fish plates have gone through a stage of evolution . The track soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variation notwithstanding attempts to use steel and concrete ties . The freight cars , at first boxes with wheels on them , have gradually developed into monsters of steel with draw bars , automatic brakes and couplings . Passenger cars at first very variable were developed from stage coaches and Conestoga wagons hitched together . In Europe they remained short , like stage coaches with side doors . In the United States they lengthened out with seats through the interior and doors and platforms at the ends . Platforms were eventually housed in with vestibules . Both types have their advantages and disadvantages . Sleeping cars seem to be a development of the canal and steamboat sleeping quarters . Here a single company early obtaining a working , if not a legal , monopoly of the business of making and operating sleepers . As a result no improvements of note have appeared in them for years . For financial efficiency the monopoly seems to be a good thing ; for mechanical progress it is not . Locomotives have shown a continual progress . One reason perhaps is their short lives ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ample opportunity for ex- // perimentation . From the Tom Thumb to the powerful Mountain Type is a long climb , but as each step was taken the individual changes were not very noticeable . Like the hour-hand of a watch only by observing its position at times quite separated can it be noticed to have traveled . In fact the entire railway system with its millions of cars operating on hundreds of roads has grown complex and yet standardized . To get a common gauge that cars from one road might pass to another required an act of Con-gress . At first companies adopted diverse gauges that their cars could not go onto another road , but when transconti-nental roads were to l* built and through lines of traffic established President Lincoln was called upon to set a gauge . He " side-tracked " the matter and threw it onto Congress , who established the distance 4 feet 81/2 inches as the standard width between rails . Without the telegraph the present amplification of rail-road business could not have taken place . The early trains traveled by time schedule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established at the stations up which the train men could climb to watch for the smoke of an approaching train . Now every division point must have its coterie of dependable dispatchers . Each wire carries multiple messages . I+:lectric signals and other safety devices to lessen accidents are universal , while the bewildering network of tracks in the ordinary city yard are operated easily from distant towers by interlocking switches . That railroads have brought about an industrial and social revolution , that they have increased enormously the country 's transportation , that they have thus been very instrumental in bringing the present civilization to its high and uniform state of attainment , can not be denied . The Evolution of the Sleeping Cax. ? Mr. Husband has made a very interesting book of the story of the Pullman car and its evolution 24 in which he traces with much detail , step by step , the improvements from 1836 , when the first Railroads 1 21 sleeping car was offered to the traveling public , to the most modern parlor car now in use . The discomfort and inconvenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by canal that only the greater speed of the former caused it to forge ahead of the latter . As the mileage of the roads increased so also did the comforts of travel . It has already been noted that sparks set fire to the clothing of passengers . Soon box-like cars replaced the open carriages and bogie trucks replaced the rigid wheels , the former giving much more protection and the latter comfort while rounding curves . But yet passengers were herded like cattle on stiff-backed narrow benches in cars with scant head clearance and width . Clean stone ballast for the road bed had not yet been thought of and the dust blew in clouds through the open windows in the summer time , and a stove vitiated the air in the winter . There were no screens or vestibules . It is a far cry from the dim flaring candle to the brilliant white incandescent electric lights . Passenger cars were rapidly improved until by 1844 they had taken on something of the appearance of the present coach . George M. Pullman , a Chicago contractor , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from close association with the Erie Canal and the sleeping arrangements of the canal boats , had visions of similar or better rail comforts . In 1858 he engaged Leonard Seibert , an employee of the Chicago &; Alton railroad , to remodel two coaches into the first Pullman sleeping cars . Mr. Pullman 's invention of upper berth construction whereby it could be closed during the day and serve as a receptacle for bedding was introduced into these cars , before which time sleeping car bunks had been stationary and on one side only . The success of his venture was such that he established a shop for the manufacture of the cars and employed technical skill to plan and make them . He had such organizing ability , however , that before his death he saw the Pullman Company holding a practical monopoly of all the sleeping cars in the // country , with through cars scheduled so that change of Pullman was unnecessary from coast to coast , or if a change had to be made it was merely a transfer from one car to a connecting car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger from Portland , Maine , to San Francisco , by way of Washington , D.C. , New Orleans and Los Angeles with only two changes of cars , namely , at New York and Washington , a total distance of 4,199 miles . It may be interesting to note that some 26,000,000 persons are annually accommodated by the 7500 cars operated by this company . Street Car Service. ? Now that more than one half the population of the United States live in cities makes the matter of local transportation of at least passing interest . Railroads were at first tram cars and many of them were built through the city streets , it was easy , therefore , to make of them street cars caring for such local traffic as desired to take advantage of them . They became a popular means of local transportation in the decade 1850-60 . As the demand became greater the one-horse car gave way to the two-horse with its longer body and greater capacity . These not being sufficient steam locomotives were used in some cities , in others the tracks were elevated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1876 , or depressed below with steam locomotives operating trains of cars rapidly loaded and unloaded at stopping points about four blocks apart . In 1879 or 1880 in San Francisco where the hills were too steep for horses the cable car was designed , whereby an endless cable operated from a central station ran continuously in a trench or conduit under the track . A grip attached to the car could be made to take hold of this cable and the car was thus drawn along . Notwithstanding they were expensive to install cable cars were rapidly replacing horse-drawn cars when electric traction came in and displaced them . Electric Traction. ? There are reports of attempts to obtain magnetic traction by the use of batteries , but not until the electric dynamo and motor had become practical workRailroads 1 23 ing machines was anything like a successful working electrically propelled car developed . The ordinary method is to generate the electricity at a central station , carry it along the track by means of a wire , from which it is taken by a trolley or some form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the track and ground . Such a car was practically demonstrated at the Berlin Exposition of 1879 , by Werner Siemens , with a line 219 yards long.25 This was the first practical electric railway . But long before this time in America experiments had been made with electric traction . Dever exhibited a model at Springfield , Massachusetts , in 1835.26 In 1879 , the year of Siemens ' exhibition , another model railway having a " third rail " to carry the current was exhibited at Stock-bridge , Massachusetts . Edison had a car in operation at Menlo Park , New Jersey , in 1882 , and the following year a small road carried passengers at an exhibit in Chicago . Miniature roads were exhibited at Philadelphia , Denver , Cleveland , New Orleans , and possibly elsewhere . The first electric railway built and operated for profit in American streets was at Richmond , Virginia , in 1885 on 21/2 miles of track . During the same year 2 miles between Baltimore and I3ampton were put in operation.21 By 1890 the number of cities having trolley cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from horse-drawn cars was very rapid . Trolley lines were even extended throughout the country districts . At one time it looked as though they might replace steam cars for passenger traffic , especially short-haul traffic . There was a complete net-work of interurban trolley lines in the Eastern and Central Western states by 1910.29 The trolley is also being used upon hard-surfaced roads without tracks by buses and trucks . Steam railroads running into New York City 1 914 Railroads through the tubes use electric locomotives to draw the trains , thus avoiding the smoke nuisance and the danger therewith connected . The Milwaukee Railroad is using electric locomotives on its mountain division in Montana and Idaho . Electricity is generated by water power ; also the trains going down grade are run against a dynamo and storage battery thus acting as a brake as well as renewing the batteries . CHAPTER V THE MODERN WAGON ROAD Gone are the long picturesque lines of emigrant and freight wagons , with their conestogas , their stage coaches , their oxen , their mules and horses ; gone are the hospitable inns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone are the nightly wagon-formed corrals into which the freighter was wont to drive his animals to prevent their stampeding by the wily red-skin ; gone are the complacent but slow-going canal barges so plentiful and popular that at the cry of " low bridge , " everybody ducked by reflex action ; gone are the floating palaces on the vacillating and changeable waters of the interior river systems ; these yesteryear implements of transportation have been all but superseded by more powerful or more speedy instruments . The canals are very frequently but weed-grown scum-covered channels through the soil , while many of the wagon roads are similarly weed-grown or dust-covered lanes on top of the soil . Perhaps a rejuvenation will come . Already the public road shows signs of a more vigorous growth than the world has ever witnessed even in the heyday of road build-ing under the Roman Caesars . Public highways began their desuetude ( partial at least ) about 1830 , at the advent of the steam railway . To be sure , arrangements were made for the laying out and care of roads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levied for road and bridge purposes . But generally the old English custom of allowing such taxes to be worked out prevailed . In Iowa , for instance , ' the county court was given " general supervision over the highways " which 126 // must be 66 feet wide unless otherwise specially directed . The manner of establishing roads is set forth and the county judge may if he wishes call in a competent sur-veyor and " cause the line of the road to be accurately sur-veyed and plainly marked out . " " Where crops have been sowed or planted before the road is finally established the opening thereof shall be delayed until the crop is har-vested . " The county supervisor must appoint a deputy in each township , but the deputy " must regard himself as an actual laboring hand " and his compensation " shall not exceed one dollar and fifty cents for each day actually employed . " It is the duty of the supervisor " to place and preserve the roads in as good a condition as the funds at his disposal will permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may think expedient or as the court may direct . " In the Eastern states and in the hilly districts the method of locating each individual road to follow a trail or stream or ridge usually prevailed , but in many of the prairie states roads were located by law on each section line and in some states on each half-section line as well . This made every man 's farm adjacent to a road , although it was certainly a waste of land . In nearly all the prairie states the legal right of way is now 66 feet , ' in other states it is made 491/2 and 33 feet . Massachusetts state-aid roads have a minimum of 50 feet . Texas divided her roads into three classes with widths of 60 , 30 and 20 feet . New Jersey has some state roads 33 feet wide . On the whole 66 feet seems to be favored . This , if roads are made on every half-section mile , appropriates almdst 5 per cent of the land , a quantity that by proper selection and location might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers because it leaves the fields rectangular , a convenient form for efficiency in cultivation . The Influence of the Bicycle on Roads. ? Road construc-tion remained in a lackadaisical state with here and there a spurt , with now and then an intelligent supervisor who appreciated the need of better wagon roads , until the com128 The Modern Wagon Road ing of the bicycle . That machine may be considered a descendant of the old celeripede , which consisted of two wheels connected by a horizontal bar on which the rider sat and propelled himself by pushing with his feet alternately on the ground , through the velocipede , which had the front wheel pivoted to the framework for easy steering . The attachment of pedals is credited to a Scotchman , Kirk-patrick Macmillan , about 1840 , who applied them to the rear wheel . In 1886 Lallement in the United States and Miehaux in France , placed the pedals on the front wheels . The front wheel was gradually increased in diameter un-til in the ' eighties it sometimes measured as much as 60 inches . The rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel was not very great ; headers were common , and mounting was difficult . To overcome these defects of the " ordinary " there was developed , 1885 , the " safety , " approximately the present bicycle , in which the pedals are carried on a separate shaft and the power transmitted by chain and sprocket to the rear wheel . With the invention of the Dunlop 3 pneumatic tire , and consequent overcoming of much of the jolting so objection-able in more solid tires , the adoption of the bicycle as a means of pleasure and business locomotion was extremely rapid . The cycling boom reached its height about 1896 or 1897 , by which time a great many large manufactories of bicycles had been established over the country . A frenzy seized upon the people and men and women of all stations were riding wheels ; ardent cyclists were found in every city , village , and hamlet . As a result of the cycling craze there were organized numerous " wheel clubs " and finally a national one known as the League of American Wheehnen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly to popularize the new sport of cycling , became a few years later almost wholly a form of propaganda for " better roads . " News-paper space was freely utilized ; many papers making // special and regular features of " good roads " ; pamphlets were published and distributed broadly , and a magazine was established.4 At first the wheelmen were met by the cry of selfish-ness , with the argument that the city folk wanted the farmers to build good roads for their pleasure ; but men of foresight , men of affairs , saw the benefits accruing to all kinds of business and added their influence . Mr. Potter , a lawyer of New York City , who had graduated in civil engineering at Cornell University before turning to the law , became interested in the good roads move-ment , studied and made himself one of the best posted men on roads in the United States . When the League of American Wheelmen decided to start a magazine he was selected for its editor and manager . Under his direction the subscription list of Good Roads soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of roads in a commercial sense and by a comparison with other countries demonstrate how far behind America is in this respect . " Pictures of good and bad roads were used freely , thus holding the attention where reading matter alone would have failed . European roads , the French especially , were described and played up through newspapers generally . Scarcely a journal that did not run leaders and other articles on the benefits of good roads and methods of building and maintaining the same . Our ordinary roads were decried on every hand . A lady voices her opinion thus : 5 I came to this country with the best prejudices , having en-joyed the privilege of meeting with some of its noblest repre-sentatives in my fatherland . I admired much the individual in-dependence , the high standing of women , the gentle sway of the church , the liberal education of the children , and the unsurpassed charity that extends even to distant countries . I must confess // that I was struck with the bad roads everywhere , in cities as well as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the com-pensation one gets when one meets with an accident . Why not spend the money in the improvements of the roads ? make these roads perfect , and then let everybody look out for himself . In summer the worst road is good ; but in winter schools have to be closed , the children are stopped in their regular pursuits , learning becomes desultory , and the strong feeling of duty that has to be developed from the very beginning of life by strict good habits gets slackened and slighted ; and so also the attend-ance of the churches ? for many people the only comfort in the struggle for existence ? becomes an impossibility . And especially the painstaking farmer must find it hard to drive his team through the muddy , clayey road , in bringing the fruits of his labor to the market . I hear him , with many a suppressed oath on everything under the sun , dragging his cartload through the mud and stand-ing pools , and in snowstorms he is sometimes totally lost . All communication stops . And so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anecdote which shows that two of the greatest Germans who ever lived did not think the lowly road too insignificant to discuss : When Heinrich Heine for the first time met with the royal poet , Goethe , he was so impressed with the majesty of his personality that he could speak of nothing less than the plum trees on the chaussee , between Jena and Weimar . Also Bill Nye , the humorist , takes a rap at the roads in this manner. ? Our wagon roads throughout the country are generally a dis-grace to civilization and before we undertake to supply Jaeger underwear and sealskin covered bibles with flexible backs to the African it might be well to put a few dollars into the relief of galled and broken down horses that have lost their breath on our miserable highways . The country system , as I recall it , was in my boyhood about as poor and inefficient as it could well be . Each township was divided up into road districts , and each road district was presided over by an overseer of highways , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so many dollars from each tax-payer in the district . Of course no taxpayer would pay a dollar // when he could come and make mud pies on the road all day and visit and gossip with the neighbors and save his dollar too . The result seemed to be that the work was misdirected and generally an injury to the road . With all our respect to the farmer , I will state right here that he does not know how to make roads . An all wise Providence never intended that he should know . The professional roadhuilder , with the money used by the ignorant sapheads and self-made road architects , would in a few years make roads in the United States over which two or three times the present sized load could be easily drawn , and the dumb beasts of the Republic would rise up and call us blessed for doing it . This bit of doggerel appeared in Good Roads about the same time : They May Be Sinking Yet Old farmer John drove off to town All on a rainy day . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . The gentle weeping raindrops fell And had fallen all the night ; The bottom of that highway ? well ; ' T was literally out of sight . But John had hitched his sturdy steeds . His sturdy steeds and true That often ' mid such urgent needs . Had boldly struggled through . And John had sworn a big round oath With deep and bated breath , He 'd rather brave the deep , forsooth , Thrice o'er than starve to death . For visions of the flour bin , ' T was empty he could see , And for a week no sugar in His coffee cup had he . And so amid the sea of mire . Those steeds right valiant reel , While turbid waves creep higher , higher , Upon the wagon wheel . // Oh ! help ye powers that rule the wave , Wherever ye may be ; Reach down and this poor mortal save From out the turbid sea . They sink , now just the horses ' ears Still struggling through the flood ; Now nothing but John 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black loam of Illinois Above that outfit met ; And since our roads are bottomless , They may be sinking yet . Thus was the propaganda for better roads spread during the last decade of the nineteenth century . And this is not all the country owes to the enthusiastic wheelman of that period . Their efforts had resulted in a stirring of the whole populace . True , some were opposed to spending money for highfalutin highways , but many of the best thinkers of the country caught the true spirit of the wave and did all they could to continue the good work . In many states organizations were formed and good roads meetings called . In Des Moines , August 16 , 1892,8 more than 300 delegates representing boards of trade , boards of super-visors , county road conventions , 88 counties and 130 cities met in an enthusiastic convention of two days ' duration with Judge E. H. Thayer of Clinton as presiding officer . On the programme were such men as Horace Boies , Gover-nor of the state , Judge Peter A. Day , Railway Commis-sioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University . The resolutions adopted among other things recommend that , until further legislation can be had , the following steps by county associations be taken : " ( 1 ) To set on foot a movement in every township in the respective counties looking to the consolidation of road districts . . . ; ( 2 ) to impress on boards of supervisors the duty of levying the county fund tax . . . ; ( 3 ) where it is apparent that the public interests will be best subserved by a larger immediate expenditure . . . to urge . . . the propriety of submitting to the people the voting of a higher levy or the issuance of bonds . . . to agitate in cities and towns the question of the propriety of expending money beyond their limits in improving highways leading thereto . . . " While this convention was in session a similar one was meeting in Missouri ; in fact practically all the states in the Union were getting " in the band wagon . " The League stopped not here , but were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They visited the president of the United States , Benjamin Harrison , at Washington in July , ' at which time he turned to Colonel Charles L. Burdet , head of the League , and said : " One thing ; if wheelmen secure us good roads for which they are so zealously working , your body deserves a medal in recog-nition of its philanthropy . " The great World 's Fair was coming off at Chicago in 1893 , and " good roads boosters " were extremely anxious that a suitable exhibition be made there . General Roy Stone framed a bill which was favorably reported by the Senate Committee July 23 , 1892 . It was a bill to create a National Highway Commission and prescribe its duties , " composed of two Senators and five members of the Rouse of Representatives , and five citizens appointed by the president " for the purpose of a general inquiry into the condition of highways in the United States and means for their improvement , and especially the best method of securing a proper exhibit at the World 's Columbian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing for public instruction in the art during the ex-hibition.1 ?

President Benjamin Harrison . Looking at it from a postal standpoint enlarged free delivery or anything like universal free delivery will have to be postponed until there are better facilities of communication through the rural and sparsely settled districts . The experiments that we have made in the smaller towns and villages have proved , the practicability of greater extended free delivery , but without good roads it must necessarily be limited to the small towns . ? John Wanamaker , Postmaster General . There is no doubt that the diffusion of knowledge in regard to the good construction of roads will be of immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Secretary of the Interior . I think the people of the United States are taking more interest in the improvement of good roads than in any other non-political matter . -0 . H. Platte , Senator from Connecticut . I have often thought that the people , speaking of them generally , have never yet understood the value of good roads . They are not only matters of convenience , but they are really matters of great economy in every community . The farmer with one team of two horses is able to move on a good road more than he could move with four horses and a wagon of much greater strength on a poor road . This I have tested personally many times . Farmers are constantly in need of the use of highways to transport their property and to move themselves from place to place . The average farmer is five miles distant from the nearest railway station and his surplus produce must be moved that distance year after year . If he were to compute the saving that he and his neighbors would have by reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to more than the expense of putting the roads in good condition and keeping them so . Our road system is miserably deficient . ? William A. Peffer , Senator from Kansas ( Populist ) . Aside from the benefits that good roads bring to the people in times of peace I do not know of a great city in this country that is provided with such highways as would admit of the expeditions marching of a great army in times of war . Washington City is a fair example in this regard . The highways leading to this city through Maryland and Virginia are both narrow // and crooked . There is not a single public outlet or inlet that can be called a great national highway . ? H. C. Hansbrough , Senator from North Dakota . In the old Roman days all roads led to Rome , and they were good roads . They built roads for military and commercial purposes , and the wisdom of their enterprise was apparent even in that early day . European nations to-day regard road-making as one of their economic questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest endeavor to benefit the agricultural classes , should have thought of good roads long ago . We want and must have splendid highways , owned not by corporations but by the people . They will be an economical investment , and an untold comfort to the traveler . ? James H. Kyle , Senator from South Dakota . The country could spend no money so economically and enlist no genious so usefully as in making better roads for communications between one neighborhood and another . ? John W. Daniel , Senator from Virginia . I esteem good roads throughout the country to be as necessary as railroads . ? Francis E. Warren , Senator from Wyoming . The prosperity of our country depends so largely on the prosperity of our farmers that everything possible should be done to render life in the rural districts agreeable as well as profitable and nothing could conduce more to the comfort and happiness of our people than the improvement of the roads . ? Joseph Wheeler , Representative from Alabama . That good roads in good condition are always of great value in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of active operations the prompt transportation of material and the moving of an army would demand it . ? Major General Oliver 0 . Howard , United States Army . The importance of good roads has been brought to my attention most forcibly on many occasions when my wagon trains have been forced to move at a snail 's pace over almost impassable roads , and when every hour 's delay might mean untold disaster . The expenditure of animal force on such occasions was fearful . In times of peace good roads are no less important ; the general condition of country roads is a very good index of the civilization and prosperity of the community . It is not difficult to show by mathematical deduction that money expended in constructing // good roads is economy from a financial standpoint , while from a social standpoint the benefits are incalculable . We have splendid railroads traversing the whole country iu every direction and we have in most cities very creditable means of rapid transit , but the country roads in most parts of the United States are really deplorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy at work on Latin and Greek before he has mastered the alphabet of his own language . ? Brig . Gen. D. K. Stanley , United States Army . The above are only a small portion of the letters from which they were extracted , but they serve to show that the League of American Wheelmen and such men as Colonel Pope were very active in spreading the gospel of good roads . The arguments in these and hundreds of other letters , from men of all classes and professions , of all political parties from all parts of the nation , cover a very wide range and the effect has been lasting . About this time , also , Senator Charles F. Manderson , of Nebraska , introduced a concurrent resolution in the Senate to print a lot of consular reports relating to streets and highways in foreign countries and distribute them in bul-letin form . The edition consisted of 30,000 and served to show how the United States was lagging behind other countries in the matter of road building.12 Office of Public Roads Inquiry. ? A very few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a great instrumentality for good roads in America . On January 26 , 1893 , Representative Deborow introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives , " instructing the committee on agriculture to incorporate in the agricul-tural appropriation the sum of $15,000 to be expended for the purpose of making investigations for a better system of roads . " 13 On the same day Representative Lewis pre-sented a similar resolution " instructing the committee on agriculture to incorporate in the bill making appropriations for the Agricultural Department a clause authorizing the // Secretary to make inquiry regarding public roads . " 14 Both resolutions were referred to the committee on agricul-ture . As a final result a statute carrying an appropriation of $10,000 was approved March 3 , 1893 . Under this statute the Office of Public Roads Inquiries was instituted , October 3 , 1893 , with " General Roy Stone , of New York , recognized as a superior civil engineer , and thoroughly identified with the popular movement toward the improvement of the high-ways in the several states , in charge . ' The Letter of Instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment summarizes the statute and defines the object and scope of the inquiry to be made . The last paragraph of the instructions shows that the old theory of " state sovereignty , " still had a place in the mind of the Secretary , and it was not for several years that this office did more than the mere collection of information relative to roads . The letter follows : 16 U. S. Department of Agriculture , Office of the Secretary , Washington , D. C. , October 3 , 1893 . Sir : You have been this day appointed to supervise and carry out the investigations pursuant to the statute approved March 3 , 1893 , which has four branches : To make inquiries in regard to the systems of road manage-ment throughout the United States . To make investigations in regard to the best method of road-making . To prepare didactic publications on this subject , suitable for distribution . To assist the agricultural colleges and experiment stations in disseminating information on this subject . It will not be profitable to enter upon all of these points at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of gradual growth , conducted at all times economically . Therefore , it is riot expected that there will be any considerable force of clerical help , and aside from your salary , no considerable ex-penditure for the present . It is understood that you have at your command the data for a compilation of the laws of several // of the states , upon which their road systems are based . It should be your first duty , therefore , to make such collection complete , and prepare a bulletin on that subject . Incidentally , while preparing this bulletin , you should charge yourself with collecting data relating to the different methods of road making , which , in the first instance , should be generic in their character ; including ( 1 ) The best method of constructing a common highway , without gravel or stone . ( 2 ) Gravel highways . ( 3 ) Macadam and other stone roads . ( 4 ) Data upon which to base suggestions for the transportation of material within reasonable access , for the proper surfacing of the roadbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulletin , or second series of bulletins . There are certain restrictions I wish specifically to bring to your attention . It must be borne in mind that the actual expense in the construction of these highways is to be borne by the localities and states in which they lie . Moreover , it is not the province of this Department to seek to control or influence said action , except in so far as advice and wise suggestion shall contribute toward it . This Department is to form no part of any plan , scheme , or organization , or to be a party to it in any way , which has for its object the concerted effort to secure and furnish labor to the unemployed persons or to convicts . These are matters to be carried on by states , localities , or charities . The Department is to furnish information , not to direct and formulate any system of organization , however efficient or desirable it may be . Any such effort on its part would soon make it subject to hostile criticism . You will publish this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly , J. STERLING MORTON , Secretary . MR . ROY STONE , Special Agent and Civil Engineer in charge of Good Roads Investigations . The Office followed these instructions pretty closely for several years . General Stone and his successor General Dodge encouraged the formation of good roads organizations . In fact General Stone prior to the institution of the Office of Road Inquiries was instrumental in organizing at Chicago in connection with the dedication of the World 's Fair in 1893 , the National League for Good Roads . GenThe // eral Stone himself attributed to the influence of this League the organization of the Office of Public Roads and the great work which it has since accomplished.17 Other good roads organizations were springing up . The Office of Public Road Inquiries encouraged these to the extent of publishing addresses given at their conventions as bulletins upon the theory that the information relative to road improvements throughout the United States was in line with the object and scope of the Office . The organization known as the National Good Roads Association , with W. H. Moore of St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Omaha , Nebraska , as secretary , seems to have been especially active . Colonel Moore was a man of impressive manner , suave and affable , and was able to interest and associate with him many very influential people . He was a born " good roads booster . " He always worked with the men in power . Directors Stone and Dodge not only had prominent places on his conven-tion programmes , but recommended to the Secretary of Agriculture that the proceedings be printed as Depart-mental Bulletins . This was for a time helpful to the cause of good roads , for the conventions were addressed by able and influential men . Director Dodge in his letter of trans-mittal of the proceedings of the convention held at St. Louis , Missouri , April 27 to 29 , 1903 , to Hon. James Wilson , Secretary of Agriculture , says : 18 Among the distinguished speakers who delivered addresses were Hon. Theodore Roosevelt , President of the United States ; Hon. William J. Bryan , of Nebraska ; General Miles , of the United States Army ; Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Hon. A. C. Latimer , United States Senator from South Carolina ; Hon. W. D. Vandiver , member of Con-gress from Missouri ; Hon. D. R. Frances , president of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition Committee ; Hon. J. H. Brigham , Assistant Secretary of Agriculture ; General Roy Stone , of New York ; and Mr. Samuel Hill , of Washington . Addresses were also delivered by prominent men engaged in agriculture , railway transportation , commercial pursuits , and newspaper work . // This organization , like many state good-roads organiza-tions , had no permanent membership list . Any city that would " finance " a convention could get one . Invitations were sent to governors , mayors , county officers , city officers , commercial clubs urging them to appoint delegates to the conventions . As a result large conventions were pro-moted and held at Chicago , St. Louis , Buffalo , Portland , and elsewhere , usually in connection with some exposition or fair . There being no permanent membership the only way to finance such undertakings was by popular subscriptions and donations from social , commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York and talked to the president of the Illinois Central railroad , Mr. Stuyvesant Fish , and asked for a special " train of fifteen cars to carry modern road machinery . " " How much will this project cost ' ? " asked Mr. Fish . Moore replied , " As near as we can figure it out , to furnish and operate this train for three months will cost you $40,000 to $50,000 . " President Fish replied , " That is a large amount to throw in the mud , but we will consider it . " The train was granted . In the lan-guage of Colonel Moore , the " railroad company shouldered the burden . " The government through the Office of Public Roads furnished two expert engineers , other engineers and necessary employees were hired . This train made the trip from Chicago to New Orleans . Advance-agents were sent along the way to secure the cooperation of the various com-munities . They were asked to raise a sufficient amount of money to defray the local expenses . Moore states , " we did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter before the mayor , the city council , and the supervisors that they did not promptly respond in the affirmative . " Road machinery carried on the train was explained by men fre-quently sent along for this purpose by the manufacturers who had donated its use or by engineers and others in // charge . Short sections of road were graded and stoned ? " object lesson roads were built . " Similar trains were run over the Lake Shore Road , and later over the Southern Railway . The latter at a cost of about $80,000 ; the road equipped the train , fed the men and furnished Pullman cars for sleeping accommodations . The last such train was over the Northern Pacific . This particular organization ( there were others ) and its work has been thus fully men-tioned to show how thoroughly the propaganda was car-ried on which resulted later in the greatest road-building campaign in the history of the world . The National Good Roads Association came to grief at the Portland Ex-position in 1905 , where strenuous opposition developed to the financing methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from the presidency of the association . James W. Abbott , Pacific Coast Agent for the Office of Public Roads in a newspaper interview among other things said ? ? " We feel that the wild , reckless and impossible things which Colonel Moore promises to do for communities must later produce a reaction positively disastrous . He has al-ready promised that the construction train of the National Good Roads Association will do an amount of work gratui-tously for communities , which , allowing for unavoidable delays , climatic and otherwise , would take more than ten years . The three good roads trains which have heretofore done object-lesson road work have been under the direct operation and executive management of Colonel Richard-son . They were wonderfully well-equipped trains , but they demonstrated that the building of suitable object-lesson roads efficiently and economically was not and could not be made a circus proposition . " In addition to good roads associations , the agitation for better roads was taken up by governors who devoted a not inconsiderable portion of their messages to the legislatures to a discussion of the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their messages to ConThe // struction and road materials . The government 's appro-priation beginning at $10,000 or excluding the Director 's salary $8000 , was increased from time to time until it was in 1896 , $37,660 and in 1911 , $135,000 . Since the adoption of the system of Federal Aid , there has naturally been greatly increased operation . The total appropriations for the Bureau of Public Roads are now approximately three quarters of a million dollars . The duties and scope of the Office of Public Roads In-quiry was gradually widened and its name changed to the Office of Public Roads . In 1915 by reorganization of the Department of Agriculture it became the Office of Public Roads and Rural Engineering and took charge of all the Department 's work which partook in any way of an engineering nature . In 1916 the Secretary of Agriculture directed the Office to act for him in the routine administra-tion of the Federal Roads Act . The work of the Office or Bureau of Public Roads , as it is now designated , was in 1916 , carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Educa-tional ; ( 2 ) Research , and ( 3 ) Administration of the Federal Road Act . By its educational or extension work the Office was endeavoring to reach the people by means of lectures , addresses , the publication of bulletins and the exhibit of models . Emphasizing the economic value of improved roads and the efficiency of various types . Special advice and assistance to communities was given by furnish-ing engineers and experts to confer with municipal officers on their particular problems . Actual demonstration by the construction of object-lesson roads was freely carried on . The community furnished the material and labor ; the Office sent its engineers and experts to design and super-intend the construction . These " seed miles " resulted in the construction of many other miles by the community itself . The Office tried to impress also the need of proper maintenance from the beginning . Fully as important as its educational work was the re-search or investigational work carried on . The Office was // able to secure the services of several young men of scientific attainment and the bulletins put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cushman and their successors have commanded world-wide recognition . Laboratories were erected to test road materials , and experimental roads were built to demonstrate the actual use of the same accord-ing to various methods . In this manner careful studies were made of a vast number of materials , including oils , asphalts , tars , concrete , brick , crushed stone and gravel . In connection with practical road men and research com-mittees of such organizations as the American Society of Civil Engineers , and the American Society for Testing Materials many useful standards have been adopted for road materials and road construction . The effect of traffic on various types of roads has also been a profitable subject for study . The organization of the Bureau may be best shown by the chart . Rural Free Delivery. ? A brief mention of this agency for better roads should not be omitted . Postmaster-Gen-eral Wanamaker , in 1890 , recommended the extension of free delivery to villages of loss than 10,000 population and he inaugurated an experimental " village delivery . " After an existence of about two years this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broader basis was demanded by State Granges of the Patrons of Husbandry and other farmers . Congress made small appropriations for rural free delivery , but the Postmaster-General , W. S. Bissell , declined to make any use of them . When Hon. W. L. Wilson became Postmaster-General ( 1895 ) he agreed with his predecessor in believing the project impractical , but if Congress would make the money available he was willing to try it out . An appropriation of $40,000 was placed at his disposal.22 The first Rural Free Delivery routes were established on October 1 , 1896 , at IIalltown , Uvilla , and Charlestown , West Virginia . Others immediately followed . President // McKinley in a message to Congress December 3 , 1900 , states that " by the close of the current fiscal year about 4000 routes will have been established , providing for the daily delivery of mails at the scattered homes of about three and a half million of rural population . " 23 So successful did it prove that it soon displaced nearly all the star routes and was well established in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1919 out of a total expenditure by the Post Office Department of over $362,000,000 , a little less than $51,000,000 was distributed to the rural delivery service.24 The Department having adopted a rule to the effect that the rural delivery service would only be established along reasonably good roads , and that a carrier need not go out unless the roads were in fit condition spurred the in-habitants up to better attention of the roads for after a man once got in the habit of receiving his mail daily he wanted it regularly . " When a heavy snow blocks the way of the rural carrier it is customary for the farmers to turn out and break the roads , and this is done several days earlier than would be the case ordinarily . In this way communication through-out neighborhoods and with the outside world is opened up promptly . In consequence the farmer is able to take ad-vantage of good markets and the townspeople are not cut off from the supply of fresh country produce , as often has happened in severe storms . Also cases of distress in isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Department finding the rural delivery popular de-termined to make it not only more so but to make it pay also . So they took precautions to protect the mail in the farmer 's boxes by regulating the kind of boxes to be used and promptly prosecuting cases of thievery and molesta-tion of mail ; they established registration by rural car-riers and allowed carriers to receipt for applications for // money orders ; carriers were also authorized to receive and deliver " drop " letters on their routes without passing them through the terminal post office . A little later when the parcel post was instituted the popularity of rural de-livery was greatly enhanced . Like many other conven-iences the rural inhabitants can not now realize how they could get along without free delivery of the mails . Post-master-General Charles Emory Smith in his report of 19001 says of the then quite new system : Rural delivery has now been sufficiently tried to measure its ffects . . . . It stimulates social and business correspondence , and so swells the postal receipts . Its introduction is invariably followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of periodic literature . The farm is thus brought into direct daily contact with the currents and movements of the business world . A more accurate knowledge of ruling markets and varying prices is diffused , and the producer , with his quicker communication and larger information , is placed on a surer footing . The value of farms , as has been shown in many cases , is enhanced . Good roads become indispensable , and their improvement is the i essential condition of the service . The material and measurable 1 benefits are signal and unmistakable . But the movement exercises a wider and deeper influence . It becomes a factor in the social and economic tendencies of American life . The disposition to leave the farm for the town is a familiar effect of our past conditions . But this tendency is checked , and may be materially changed by an advance which conveys many of the advantages of the town to the farm . Rural free delivery brings the farm within the daily range of the in-tellectual and commercial activities of the world , and the isola-tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sensibly mitigated . It proves to be one of the most effective and powerful of educational agencies . Wherever it is extended the schools improve and the civil spirit of the com-munity feels a new pulsation ; the standard of intelligence is raised , enlightened interest in public affairs is quickened , and better citizenship follows . With all these results clearly indicated by the experiment as thus far tried , rural free delivery is plainly here to stay . It can not be abandoned where it has been established , and can not be maintained without being extended . // The law for federal aid is based upon the clause in the Constitution giving Congress power " to establish post offices and post roads . " 27 and the money made available may only be expended on post roads outside of towns " having a population of two thousand five hundred or more , except that portion of any such street or road along which the houses average more than two hundred feet apart.728 Thus may be seen the very great importance to better public highways of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicyclist and voluntary road organizations were creating sentiment favorable to improved highways , the states were not idle . It will not be possible to follow the progress in each of the states , but since some form of state aid has been adopted by all of them the development of that idea will be sketched . By state aid is meant a plan whereby a part of the expense of constructing roads is borne by the state and a part by the locality in which the road lies . New Jersey , 29 like many of the other Eastern states , had a few turnpike roads constructed and maintained by private corporations . These roads were much better than the public roads on which there were no toll gates . The public roads were administered under ordinary laws of overseers of highway districts . Charges of partiality had led to amendments , then other amendments until the laws were a maze of intricacies . To eliminate these , the state board of agriculture in 1887 called a mass meeting of farmers and others interested in good roads . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointment of a committee , consisting of one member for each of the Congressional districts in the State ; to examine the laws of New Jersey , of other states and of foreign countries and report methods for bettering the New Jersey system . After careful consideration they drafted a law // abolishing the overseers and conferring the powers and duties of caring for the public highways on the township committee . This was presented to the State Board of Agriculture and received unanimous approval . But when it came before the State Legislature , of 1888 , for adoption the opposition of the road overseers succeeded in defeating it . In 1889 it was again presented and defeated ; and met a similar fate in 1890 . But in 1891 with the cooperation of the governor its passage was secured . Mr. Clayton Conrow of New Jersey30 claims the honor of proposing the first state aid road law in the United States . He asserts that he learned from actual observation of the travelers on a section of highway that it was used not only by " teams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the township beyond , and so on and on they came until a score of townships were rep-resented on this section of the road . " He therefore con-cluded that the county and the state by rights should assist in building the main traveled roads , and that " every citizen of the state is entitled to the free use thereof . " This , he says , was in 1890 , just the time the state board of agriculture was pushing its law to discontinue the over-seers . Conrow says he consulted with Hon. Edward Bur-rough , president of the state board of agriculture , and outlined his plan for a State Aid Road Law . Burrough was highly pleased , but there was an obstacle in the way , namely the turnpike corporations . They were creatures of the law and had rights that should be respected . Mr. Burrough advocated the adoption of the law having faith that the people would buy the turnpike roads so that no citizen would be the loser . Judge William M. Lanning put the draft of the bill in legal form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they did not care to encounter a veto if a slight change of form would // reconcile him to its provisions . Mr. Conrow claims his original draft was changed only slightly by the board and again by the governor , then submitted to the legislature by a Mr. Davidson of Gloucester county . This is the act that was passed in 1891 . Salient Features of the State Aid Law. ? The essential points of the law are set forth in the following extract being the preamble and parts of the seventh and fourth sections : An Act to provide for the more permanent improvement of the public roads of this State . Whereas public roads in this State have heretofore been built and maintained solely at the expense of the respective townships in which they are located ; and Whereas such roads are for the convenience of the citizens of the counties in which they are located , and of the entire State as well as of said townships ; and Whereas the expense of constructing permanently improved roads may be reasonably imposed in due proportions , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located : Therefore , . . . And be it enacted , That whenever there shall be presented to the board of chosen freeholders of any county a petition signed by the owners of at least two-thirds of the lands and real estate fronting or bordering on any public road . praying the board to cause such road . . . to be improved under this act , and setting forth that they are willing that the peculiar benefits conferred on the lands fronting or bordering on said road .. . shall be assessed thereon , in amount not exceeding ten per centum of the entire cost of the improvement , it shall be the duty of the board to cause such improvements to be made : Provided , that the estimated cost of all improvements . . . in any county in any one year shall not exceed one-half of one per centum of the ratables of such county for the last preceding year . . And be it enacted , That one-third of the cost of all roads constructed . shall be paid for out of the State treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any one year exceed the sum of seventy-five thousand dollars . . . . It will be seen that under this law the property owners pay one-tenth , the State one-third and the county the remaining 562/3 per cent . Except for the 10 per cent paid // by the abutting property holders the burden borne by all citizens of the county is the same . The friends of the movement demanded its enforce-ment ; the opponents were equally determined which re-sulted in an appeal to the courts and the mandatory fea-tures were sustained . As it was first enacted the total ex-penditure was $20,000 and a Commissioner of Agriculture was to supervise its disbursement . But as there was no such officer the next legislature , at the suggestion of the governor , authorized the president of the State Board of Agriculture to perform these duties ; this he did until the office of the Commissioner of Public Roads was created . The first money paid out under the act was December 27 , 1892 , $20,661.85 , and this was the first money paid in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight amendments the law remains to the present and has been emulated by nearly all the states in the Union . In Massachusetts advocates of better roads attempted legislation looking toward a system of state highways in 1887 and annually thereafter until 1892.31 In 1892 the de-mand became so great that the legislature enacted a law providing for a commission of three to inquire into the entire subject and report to the legislature of 1893 , with suitable appropriation for the purpose . The commission made a thorough investigation , held public hearings , and made inquiries among all classes . Their findings were brought before the legislature and a general road law was enacted providing for a commission of three competent persons who should give advice to those having charge of the public highways ; it further contemplated the building and care for by this commission of a system of state high-ways connecting the several municipalities . At first the counties were supposed to grade the roads and the Com-monwealth to surface them but the law was changed ( 1894 ) so that the Commonwealth through the highway comThe // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges back to the counties 25 per cent of the cost , so that finally the State pays 75 per cent and the county 25 per cent . In 1913 an amendment was made to relieve small communities from the payment of the entire amount thus the State , in reality , pays more than 75 per cent of the expense . The state aid principle has been adopted by all states in the union ; many before federal aid came , the remainder since . Connecticut was third in 1895 and New York fourth in 1898 . In order to raise money to meet the demands for state aid roads many of the states bonded themselves for large amounts . New York voted a bond issue of $50,000,000 in 1906 and another of the same amount in 1912 . California voted bonds of $18,000,000 in 1910 and $15,000,000 in 1916 . Illinois voted $60,000,000 in 1920 eventually to be paid from automobile licenses . Maryland authorized a bond issue of $5,000,000 for trunkline roads ; additional issues were made in 1910 , $1,000,000 ; in 1912 , $3,170,000 ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri authorized a $60,000,000 bond issue in 1921 and so on for other states . On January 1 , 191432 there were outstanding highway and bridge bonds in the United States to the amount of $445,147,073 ; of which $158,590,000 had been voted by the States and $286,557,073 by counties and town-ships . After the war increased interest in road building became manifest . Between November 1 , 1918 , and Decem-ber 31 , 1919,33 state highway bonds amounting to $234,000 , - 000 were voted : Illinois , $60,000,000 ; Pennsylvania $50 , - 000,000 ; Michigan , $50,000,000 ; Missouri , $60,000,000 and many other states smaller amounts . There is pending legis-lation for nearly $300,000,000 additional bonds , among which are Minnesota , $75,000,000 ; Texas , $75,000,000 ; West Virginia , $40,000,000 ; Washington , $30,000,000 ; Alabama$25000,000 . Funds are otherwise raised by 15 2 The Modern Wagon Road direct taxation . property and special , by appropriations from the general fund , by automobile licenses , and from court fines . The grand total for road construction ex-pended in the United States from 1910 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road building age in the United States was ushered in by the enactment of the law pro-viding that " the Secretary of Agriculture shall on behalf of the United States in certain cases aid the States in the construction and maintenance of rural post roads . " From the time Representative Brownlow startled the country in 1904 by introducing a bill to appropriate $24,000,000 for road building , not a session of Congress passed without several such bills being introduced . Most of these took the form of creating a commission to administer any fund for national aid that might be appropriated , and many feared such large appropriations would result in " pork barrels " all over the country . In 1915 one such bill passed the House but did not become a law . However , the leaven con-tinued to work . The influence of the automobile was mak-ing thousands of new road enthusiasts every day . Many petitions were being rained upon Congress and scores of bills introduced for national aid both for specific roads and of a general nature . During the 63d Congress , forty-nine bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House . A report had been submitted by a joint congressional com-mittee on January 21 , 1915 34 embodying data from for-eign countries showing systems in effect , the mileage and cost of roads constructed ; similar data from the several states ; extracts from state constitutions showing limitations of state debts ; statistics on tonnage transported over rural roads ; statistics on length , character and condition of rural routes ; transportation rates on road materials by rail ; comparative statistics embodying possible factors in ap-portionment of Federal aid ; statistics of wealth , debt , and highway expenditures ; comparative statistics on the cost // of road construction , historical sketches of national roads , work of the Office of Public Roads ; and a synopsis on con-gressional action on Federal aid to road improvement . The report speaks of the economic importance of good roads , the constitutionality of Federal aid and gives data to show the public sentiment in favor of Federal aid . Of 10,000 replies to inquiries received from every state in the Union , 97 per cent favored Federal aid and 3 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shackleford of Missouri , chairman of the committee on roads , introduced the bill which later became a law . The bill ran the usual course and created a great deal of interest and was freely debated in both House and Senate . The discussion on it comprises more than 300 pages of the Congressional Record35 and cover practically every reason for and ob-jection to the betterment of highways and the use thereon of national money . The bill finally passed the house January 25 , 1916 , by a vote of 283 Yeas , 81 Nays and 70 not voting ; and the Senate as amended , May 8 , 1916 , by a unanimous vote . The bill went to conference , the Senate agreed to the conference report June 27 , and the House June 28 , 1916 . President Wilson approved the bill July 11 , 1916 , and it became Public Law , No. 156 , 64th Congress . The title of the bill as amended is " An Act to provide that the United States shall aid the States in the Con-struction of rural post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to cooperate with the states through their respective highway departments in the construction of rural post roads . In order to keep state sovereignty intact no money apportioned under the act could be expended in any state until the legislature of that state shall have assented to the pro-visions of the Act . The Secretary of Agriculture and the State Highway department agree upon the roads to be constructed therein and the character and method of con-struction . By providing that all roads constructed under Ib // the provisions of the act shall be free from tolls of all kinds Congress avoided the objection raised by President Monroe in his veto of the National Road bill in 1822 . A most liberal definition of Post Roads is also given in the bill , namely , " the term rural post road ' shall be construed to mean any public road over which the United States mails now are or may hereafter be transported , excluding every street and road in a place having a population , as shown by the latest available federal census , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of any such street or road along which the houses average more than two hundred feet apart . " For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the act there was appropriated for the fiscal years ending June 30 , 1917 , the sum of $5,000,000 ; 1918 , $10,000,000 ; 1919 , $15,000,000 ; 1920 , $20,000,000 ; 1921 , $25,000,000 . After deducting the amount necessary for administration not exceeding 3 per cent , the remaining amount available was to be distributed as follows : " One-third in the ratio which the area of each State bears to the total area of all the States ; one-third in the ratio which the population of each State bears to the total population of all the States as shown by the latest available Federal census ; one-third in the ratio which the mileage of rural delivery routes and star routes in each State bears to the total mileage of rural delivery routes and star routes in all the states . " The Secretary of Agriculture is to approve only projects which are substantial in character . Items of engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the estimated cost . The share paid by the Government shall not exceed 50 per cent of the total cost . The same act appropriated $10,000,000 for the survey , construction and maintenance of roads and trails within the national forests when necessary to develop the resources upon which communities within and adjacent to the national forests are dependent . The Secretary of Agriculture issued September 1 , 1916 , a set of rules and regulations for carrying out the FederalThe // Aid Road Act.36 These are quite detailed and require a close supervision by the Office of Public Roads and Rural Engineering , the Director of which or other officers and employees designated by him , was officially appointed to represent the Secretary of Agriculture in its administra-tion . These rules explain and relate specifically to defini-tions of terms ; information to be furnished the Secretary ; project statements ; surveys , plans , specifications and estimates ; project agreements ; contracts ; construction work and labor ; records and cost keeping ; payments ; sub-mission of documents to the Office of Public Roads . A State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Project Statement " to enable the Secretary to ascertain ( a ) whether the project conforms to the re-quirements of the act ; ( b ) whether adequate funds , or their equivalent , are or will be available by or on behalf of the State for construction ; ( c ) what purpose the project will serve and how it correlates with other highway work of the State ; ( d ) the administrative control of , and re-sponsibility for , the project ; ( e ) the practicability and economy of the project from an engineering and construc-tion standpoint ; ( f ) the Federal aid desired . " Also there must be submitted for approval forms of contract , with documents referred to in them , and the contractor 's bond . Likewise maps of surveys , plans , specifications and estimates , showing quantity and cost shall have the ap-proval of the Secretary . The state shall provide the rights of way and railroad grade crossings shall be avoided where practicable . A project agreement between the State Highway Department and the Secretary is executed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other devices were employed , prior to the begin-ning of construction , to insure economical and practical expenditures , and rules for submitting and tabulating bids // are given . Samples of the materials to be used must be submitted for approval whenever requested , and all ma-terials , unless otherwise stipulated , must be tested prior to use by the standard methods of the Office of Public Roads . Supervision shall include adequate inspection . Reports of progress , records and cost accounts must be kept in approved manner . Many states in order to take advantage of the Federal aid within the time stipulated by the Act have , as has been shown , issued long-time bonds . Others have relied on in-creased taxation , and many require abutting property to pay a special tax for improvements . The success of the Act was extremely marked . So much so that the Post Office A ppropriation act of February 28 , 1919,37 carried an amendment to the original Federal Aid Act providing an additional appropriation of $200,000,000 for post roads and $9,000,000 for forest roads . Fifty million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and $75,000,000 was made available for each of the fiscal years of 1920 and 1921 . Of the forest road fund $3,000,000 was made available for each of the fiscal years 1919 , 1920 and 1921 . This bill transferred to the Secre-tary of Agriculture all available war material and equip-ment suitable for use in the improvement of highways for distribution to the several states on a value basis the same as provided in the Federal Aid Act of 1916 . Under this provision trucks , road equipment , and road materials having when new a value of over $100,000,000 had been dis-tributed by November 1 , 1919 . CHAPTER VI INTERRELATION BETWEEN HIGHWAY AND OTHER KINDS OF TRANSPORTATION Transportation has been classified as primary and secondary . Transportation on the public highway , whether of raw products to the market or finished products to the consumer , is denominated primary ; transportation by rail-roads , canals , and ships as secondary . Practically all secondary transportation is of products which were first or last or both subjects of primary transportation . ) There should , therefore , be a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hand , " You are useless , it is I who support the body " ; and the hand should retort , " Think you 're smart , do n't you ? I 'll let you know it is I who collect and prepare the food which nourishes it ; a log of wood could easily replace you " : would that make either one of them independent of the other ? Too true that the great railroad corporations have not always acted in a manner suitable to the man in the street , that they have often taken too much toll , that they have become rich and arrogant , that they have frequently manipulated the political machinery of government in their own favor , that they have exploited where they should not , that they have shown favoritism to prominent shippers , and that they have often borne down heavily on the labor-ing man ; but , this country would never have been de-veloped to its present state of civilization and prosperity without some powerful and efficacious method of transpor-tation . The railroads , proving themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either the public highways or the waterways , without perhaps intending any maliciousness , put them practically out of business . Now that improved roads and automobiles and motor trucks are giving the railroads a race for their life some unthinking persons are gloating over the fact and shouting " to the victor belongs the spoils . " The evolutionary law that the " fittest will survive " does not necessarily mean that what is best for the world , for government , for society , for business will always survive . Weeds will often choke out the corn unless prevented by outside influence . A beautiful elm stands on the corner . Every spring it sheds an abundance of seeds ; soon these germinate and there springs up throughout the lawn , flower and vegetable gardens , myriads of young elm trees . Now elm trees in their proper place are desirable , are useful , are ornamental and furnish pleasure , but when they become weeds they should be rooted up that the lawn , the vegetables , and the flowers may persist . Here the fittest for society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam and electric , the waterways and the highways all have spheres of usefulness ; let each perform its function and there need be no incongruity or discord . Experience has proved time and again that any machine has a particular capacity at which it can be most efficiently operated . A simple stone crusher kept half full is running at a loss ; if crowded and speeded up it will wear and break unduly . It would be foolish to run continually a 50 horse-power engine to serve a 2 horse-power motor . An electric light plant is most economical when operated at its " capacity . " Horse and wagons , motor trucks , railways , canals , and ships , are but machines , and the law holds with all of them that they are most efficient when operated at their proper capacity . Another economic truth is that the unit cost of production is usually lowest when the output is great . Quantity production is the goal of practically all successful manufacturing enterprises . Automatic and near-automatic Relation between Highway and Transportation 161 machines replace the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical devices produces as much in the same time as could a score or even a hundred without such help formerly . The chief reason why quantity production is cheaper than individual production is that it allows for a division of labor , a separation of the preparing processes into several operations or occupations . Growing the grain , transporting it to market , grinding it into flour , baking it into bread , and selling the bread , indicate some of the several occupations , that arise in the simple preparation of " our daily bread . " The meat-packing industry affords an excellent example of the principle : The animal is surveyed and " laid off like a map " ; and each workman as the carcass passes him has one operation to perform . One man sticks the pig , another scalds it , another pulls the hair from a particular portion of the body , one cuts the slits for the gambols , another inserts the sticks , still others hoist the body to the hanger , and so on as it proceeds along its course scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work until the entire animal is prepared and packed for shipment . The workmen are classified and the highest paid are put to the most delicate or important parts while for the less delicate and less important duties the pay is very much lower . But each workman having only a small variety of work to perform soon becomes adept and can do a much greater amount than if he attempted the entire round of labor . The building of automobiles wherein materials start from different places and eventually coalesce as they proceed on their journey through the shops by each workman as they pass adding one thing or performing one operation until the whole emerges a complete machine ready to run away under its own power , is another case in point . Mr. James J. Hill , when president of the Great Northern , Northern Pacific and Chicago Burlington &; Quincy railroad companies , applied the principle of quantity production to railroad transportation . Under his supervision locomotives and cars increased in size ; this necessitated 162 Relation between Highway and Transportation heavier rails and more substantial track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full load had been accumulated ; regular schedules were of course done away with except for passenger and a few local freight trains . Other trains were to be run only at the full capacity of the locomotive . This was not conducive to speed , but the unit cost of hauling a ton of freight one mile was very ma-terially reduced . The same crew with comparatively small increase in costs may operate a train of many cars about as easily as one of few cars . The same principle underlies the efforts of motor trans-port companies . ' I'hcy are increasing the size of trucks and loads to decrease cost . They have not used discretion , however , in this and their heavy trucks have ground to powder high-cost roadways with the result that public sentiment is reacting against them and regulatory laws are being passed by many legislatures . Increasing the size of the plant , train , or truck will not bring economies unless it can be run at its capacity load , consequently when the trade or traffic will not utilize full loading a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse-power gasoline engine to turn a 114 horse-power washing machine motor is no more foolish than to run 100-car locomotives to pull 2-car trains , or 7-ton trucks where the load never exceeds 2 tons , or 7-passenger automo-biles with 1 or 2 passengers . The contention is well founded that western railroad methods are futile on New England railroads ' and that if prosperity is ever to come to New England roads they ' must reduce their rates and rates can only be reduced by making the size and number of cars commensurate with the character and amount of traffic . In England where shipping distances are com-paratively short the small van or car and quick deliveries have been evolved . In well-settled portions of this country , as in New England , similar practices might well be adopted that the railways may not be entirely eliminated and the Relation between Highway and Transportation 163 public forced eventually to resort to more expensive transportation methods when both direct and indirect costs are considered over the public highways . The railroads are also complaining that the automobile is cutting into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else can be expected with approximately 11,000,000 machines now in operation ? Thousands of tourists are daily traversing the country . They find the outing pleasant and when several occupy one car it is cheaper than railroad travel . Free camping along the way avoids hotel bills which have grown inordinately during the past few years . If these rates continue , simple inns as in the olden days may grow up and cut into the business of the high-priced hotels . Lower charges for both railroads and hotels will mitigate but not entirely eliminate the automobile competition . The motor car is here to stay and automobile travel will continue to increase . It is no longer a theory but a condition which exists , and the railroads and hotels should adopt the policy of the wily politician , ? who said , " If you ca n't lick ' em , jine ' em , " ? meet the automobile half way and make the most of it . If predictions of those in close touch with the automobile business be any criterion the railroads will feel the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blanchard , writing in Popular Science Monthly , January , 1923 , p. 26 , claims that the $150 passenger car is in sight , and that the " saturation point " which has been a worry for years has not yet arrived and will not if the lowering of prices keeps pace with increased production . It is pointed out that the production of automobiles and trucks is still increasing . The 1922 output ( 2,577,220 machines ) is more than the 1920 output ( 2,276,000 ) and these are bought by the public as fast as made . Mr. Durant , a prominent manufacturer , is quoted as saying that : " The development of a cheaper car than we now believe possible is only a question of the development of the highways . Millions more of automobiles would be in use in America to-day if the conditions of our highways permitted . When our automobiles can be built 164 Relation between Highway and Transportation to run on highways that are on the average as good as our city streets ? and this is bound to come sooner or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper cars . And the time is not far distant . " In Roger W. Babson 's weekly comment dated September 30 , 1922 , we read : Railroads have already felt the effects of pleasure automobiles , but they have not really begun yet to feel the effects of auto trucking . The trucking of goods within a radii of 50 or 100 miles has only begun and this radius may readily be extended to cover 200 or 2511 smiles . Transcontinental systems . have nothing to fear from trucks . In fact the trucks may help them . Other roads those intermediate in length can survive and perhaps profit under this competition . With roads such as shortline roads this is not true . These roads are bound to suffer far more from the truck than they now think possible . We shall live to see great highways built by the state exclusively for truck use . Railroads are destined ultimately to lose all of their short haul business and hence the roads which are in comparatively small and compact territories are sure to suffer . The only hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of way to the state in order that the tracks may be removed and concrete highways laid in their place . Many roads have parallel lines to-day under their control . The wise railroad company will develop one of these for itself and will sell the other at a good price to the state for a concrete truck highway . If the steam railroads are feeling the competition of the motor , the interurban trolley lines and the street-car companies are harder hit . The interurban lines are most of them short and depend upon local traffic . Their cars stopped at any cross-road along the way to pick up passengers and freight . But the motor transport is going them one better ; it picks up its load at the front gate , saving the trouble of even a short walk , or in the case of freight , of loading and unloading and a short haul to the track . The case of street-car lines is slightly different . So many persons are purchasing and daily using automobiles to go to and from business that the street-car people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many lines are running behind and one at least , Des Moines , Iowa , entirely stopped operation ( August , 1917 ) . The moment they found their revenues decreasing they ran to the railway commissions and city councils with requests for permits to increase rates of fare . The increase when allowed not only failed to alleviate but aggravated the trouble . Even old-fashioned persons who formerly traveled home for luncheon and back afterward began patronizing cafeterias and clubs . The habit of eating noon luncheon down town was soon formed . Others emulated their example , resulting in the loss of hundreds and even thousands of fares per week . Riding to and from work in an automobile has a fascination for most men , and every one in a street car who sees his neighbor whizzing along by the side vows that he , too , will drive a car as soon as he can save enough money to make the first payment . Useless for the street car managers to try to prove to him that the expenses of a car ? gas , oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street car fares ; everybody knows that , but he must be in the style . Farmers , as the implement dealers have found to their sorrow , will do without or tinker up old harvesters and plows in order to enjoy the pleasure of owning an automobile . The mechanic may change his seven-passenger for a light-four as wages go down but he still insists on riding his own car . The merchant while complaining that others should give up their machines and pay their bills , hangs on to his own with the grip of death . Women , even , are willing to give up pretty dresses and wear khaki overalls at least half the time . It looks as though many will hereafter live a nomadic life using their cars and garages more than their one- and two-room apartments . Stop the people from using motors and force them back to the street cars ? Never , until the hardships of living reach the state of starvation and nakedness . In addition to the owners of automobiles there are the taxicabs , " jitneys , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant it is desired to maintain for the good of 166 Relation between Highway and Transportation the community then these others are weeds if allowed free rein . If , when the street-car companies go bankrupt and quit business , the motor cars could give a better . service , outside of the fact that property had been destroyed with-out compensation , no particular damage would be notice-able to the community as a whole . But the experience of Des Moines shows that while special efforts were made to transport every one ; buses were brought in from distant cities and owners of cars most freely picked up the pedes-trians , nevertheless , there was much inconvenience and discontent . Private cars can not long be depended on to carry free the throng ; taxicabs are too expensive , in-sufficient in number and have no regular schedule ; jitneys are unreliable sporadic cars , and half of them go out of business on days of bad weather . There is left then the buses . These may be made of such size and be run with such regularity as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will survive and always be a strong competitor of the electric surface street car . Not being confined to a track they load and unload at the curb thus eliminating an element of danger from passing vehicles much feared by timid people . Not having to keep up a track , trolley lines , or a plant for generating electricity the expenses are not particularly great per bus , from $25 to $35 per day will cover them , it is estimated , ' Relation between Highway and Transportation 167 which puts the bus on a par in this respect with the small street car . There is a legitimate field for these buses in the smaller cities and on streets in large cities not easily reached by , or upon which it is desirable not to have street-car tracks . But they should not be free lances ? they should be under regulations as street cars are under regulations , they should make scheduled trips , they should be backed by capital or insurance sufficient to pay indemnities in cases of accident and upon payment of license fees are entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A cheap form of transportation , either electric trolley , with or without track , or buses , is absolutely necessary . Buses and individual jitneys can not , where the business is heavy , carry passengers as cheaply as the electric street car , but for a more limited traffic the buses may take their place , and for still less traffic jitneys can find a useful occupation . If buses and jitneys are allowed absolute freedom without restrictions as to schedule or route they will skim the cream from the street transportation business and so reduce the revenues of the street cars that they will have to discontinue operation . A thing so undesirable that the public will have to subsidize the street cars and guarantee a certain percentage of earnings or take over their ownership , run them at a nominal fare and let the taxpayer take care of the deficit . By these means those persons who ride their own automobiles , the heavier taxpayers , who are , or should be , most vitally interested in maintaining cheap transportation for the unfortunate residue who can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the industrial and commercial prosperity of the city , will be required to pay a portion of the upkeep of street-car transportation . If a subsidy be adopted it would be better that it should not be a direct guaranty of a fixed percentage of earnings for in that manner there is no premium on efficiency as our Government found to its cost in dealing with the railroads during the recent war . It would be better if some sort of a sliding scale could be 168 Relation between Highway and Transportation worked out whereby the lines should be relieved of occupational taxes or license fees in proportion as they lowered fares , and such that the lower the fares the greater the percentage of profit they might earn . The contract or charter might provide that all earnings above a specified percentage , due allowance having been made for operation , repairs , and upkeep , on bona fide capital invested should be turned over to the city as a license for the use of the streets . For example with a fare of three cents the city might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reduction of taxes and all payments to the city an earning of 10 per cent ; on a five cent fare guarantee 3 per cent and allow earnings of 8 per cent ; and so on as shown by the accompanying table the figures of which are merely illustrative : To make a workable contract of this sort there would first have to be an agreement as to the corporation capital upon which earning percentages are to be based . If this could be made equal to the real investment it would be absolutely just to both the public and the corporation . However , the so-called unearned increment would in some cases have to be considered . Publicity in accounting , capitalization , bonded indebtedness and earnings , and the feeling engendered that the public is in a sense a co-partner with the corporation would add to more harmonious relations between the two . Similar contracts might be arranged between bus lines and the city , or between bus lines and the state where rural Relation between Highway and Transportatin 169 roads are used , and between railroad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Objection may be raised to this plan on the ground that it violates usury laws . Nearly every state in the Union provides by law for a maximum rate of interest . Laws of this kind have existed almost since the beginning of history and are so imbedded in the minds of the people that they believe 6 or 7 per cent is all a public service corporation should be allowed to make on its investment , when as a matter of fact all sorts of private businesses are making profits many times that amount without hindrance by law or public sentiment . People who risk money in adventures which are in general for the good of the public should be allowed returns fully as high as those suggested , even though they do go beyond the customary 7 per cent . Whatever the right figures are careful accounting and publicity will have a tendency to establish , and once established they ought to be as stable and permanent as life insurance rates and thus encourage the investment of funds in such enterprises . Legitimate Fields of Transportation Agencies. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be put out of business by less efficient ones , what seems to be the most feasible interrelations that will allow all of them to live and let live ? There seems to be no doubt but what the railroads can and do transport large quantities long distances quicker , better , and more efficiently than can be done on the highways . Highways may be considered as feeders of the railways . With good roads the zone from which the railway can profitably draw products for long distance or quantity transportation is widened , and again widened very materially when better roads allow the use of motors in place of horses . This , if no other railway interferes , means a larger grand total of traffic hauled . Again the character of the farming along the zone served by a railroad will depend upon the facilities for marketing as well as soil and
