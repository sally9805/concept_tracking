Soon after 5 o'clock in the morning the three motors of the Trimotored Fokker monoplane Friendship , which Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd sold several weeks ago when he decided not to use it on his proposed South-Polar flight , began to hum . The ship taxied out from the boat-landing of the Jeffrey Yacht Club in East Boston . Further out in the harbor the Friendship made four attempts to leave the water ; then one of the crew of four stepped off onto a tug nearby . This time when the plane slid over the misty water the spray faded suddenly under her pontoons and the Friendship climbed up slowly in a curving line into the early morning . A man in a small boat , one of the few witnesses , shouted , " Hey . . . . They 're off for England . " <P> The Friendship 's departure had been shrouded in reticence by backers ( principally Mrs. Frederick Guest , wife of a Britisher and daughter of Millionaire U. S. Senator Phipps of Colorado ) and crew .

The other two were just the kind of people who would be likely to depart from a yacht club landing when they wanted to fly to England . One was slim Lou Gordon , mechanic , 26 , in aviation since 1919 . The third was a girl who looked exactly like Charles Augustus Lindbergh . <P> She was Amelia Earhart ( pronounced airheart ) , who has studied medicine and science at Columbia University , who has flown 500 solo hours , who has owned two planes , who is a professional social worker when not an aviatrix . She planned to control the plane at least part of the time on " the way to England . " <P> A few minutes before noon the Friendship swooped down into Halifax harbor , Nova Scotia . Her crew went to a hotel and early to bed . Miss Earhart refused to tell newsgatherers what kind of powder she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only to land at Trepassey , Newfoundland , to fix a slight leak in the gasoline tank .
