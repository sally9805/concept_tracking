William Williams Keen , witty , venerable Philadelphia surgeon , lately underwent a minor operation . Afterwards he received a scolding letter : " Why did n't you have the operation without an anesthetic , so you could see how the animals feel that you have tortured all these years ? You will have an awful body in the next incarnation . . . . You have one foot in the grave now and the other foot on a banana peel , you old fiend . " Remarked Surgeon Keen : " I take it that the letter is from a woman . If so I pity her possible husband . The fun of the thing is that I never have been a research worker . I have never experimented on any animal , not even a mouse or a frog . I shall keep my eye on that banana peel , you may be sure . " Last January Surgeon Keen was 92.
