New York : Alfred A. Knopf. 432 Pages . $6 . WHEN a victorious general , who has been hon orably retired , exchanges the sword for the pen , ! t may be declared that he realizes as completely as our " Perfect human condition permits that otium cum digni tate which is every functionary 's dream for his closing days . As the first fruits of this happy leisure , General Allen gave us a few years ago his " Rhineland Journal . " It was an . account in diary form of the happenings , great and little , 11. lanorous and tragic , which attended the presence of American troops in Germany in the period 1919-23 , and owed its interest not only to the vivacious relief given the recorded incidents but in even greater measure to the Judicious , four-square and seasoned personality of the diar ? st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new work the same occupation , the general , dropping the sub- ieetive note , proceeds to give a systematic and largely technical account of the military and civil governments 5t LIP by victors in the Rhineland , the cooperation of the two services as well as their relation to the German civil government , and the origin and solution of the successive crises which arose . The author is at pains to show that the United States made many a positive contribution to the situation . In the first place , the project of a civil Inter-Allied Rhineland Commission to replace the crude rule of the army originated with an American , Mr. Pierre ? pont B. Noyes ; and as soon as the Commission had begun to operate , the American delegates , Mr. Noyes , in the first instance , and afterward General Allen , consistently used all the influence they commanded in favor of guiding prin ? ciples whereby the natives were to be left in possession of every civil right compatible with the safety of the occupy ? ing forces . As an objective , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book fills a gap and worthily completes a record ; but the appeal it will make to the general body of Americans will , after all , exactly as in the case of the " Rhineland Journal , " be due to the sturdy personality it reveals , as well as to the sharp light it throws on Franco-German relations . With all the reserve imposed by obligations resulting from an en ? thusiastic comradeship in arms , General Allen recounts the activities of the French , who , from the first moment of the occupation of the Rhineland , went impulsively beyond the restrictions imposed on themselves by the older holding powers , the British , the Belgians , and the Americans . In this particular sector they made themselves thoroughly at home , removed German officials practically at will , and secretly organized and systematically fostered the Rhenish separatist movement . All this was regrettable in the American 's eyes , but then again it was human , all too human in view of the long war fever followed by the sudden intoxication of victory . Not till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage familiar to us under the hypocritical name of sanctions , and involv ing the brazen seizure of further Germany territory , does the author unequivocally voice his disapproval . Being a statesman and a gentleman as well as a soldier , he recog ? nized that this vindictive folly would inevitably sow a neW crop of dragon 's teeth , and in the end render fruitless the effort put forth by the reasonable group among the victors in behalf of a genuine pacification of Europe . The book closes with the withdrawal , of the American troops in the spring of 1923 ; and although no breath of criticism ruf ? fled his official relations , the General retired from the scene nursing the private conviction that the ancient question of the Rhine had , by the irrepressible spirit of aggression , become once again the chief storm center of an agonizing Europe . Observing these same French activities from the other , bank of the Rhine , Herr Stegemann arrived at a precisely identical conclusion ; and desiring , as a good German patriot , to arouse his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dangers of the situation , he formed the Pia ? of unfolding the Rhine problem in its historical perspective by tracing the vicissitudes of the thousand-year-old strug ? gle between the French and German nations for the P ? s " session of the valley . Certainly a legitimate historical pro ? ject , provided one whole-heartedly seeks the facts and follows them in their variety , confusion and richness wher ? ever they happen to lead . But that is what this author was unable to do ; for , though he wraps himself ostentatiously in the robes of Clio , he swiftly reveals himself as less a historian than that but too familiar type , an arm- chair strategist . At least , military matters are his secret passion , and it is around a distinctly military thesis that he builds the material with which he hopes to hypnotize his readers . This thesis ? it disentangles itself almost at once from the text , and then is repeated with the tiresome iteration of a dull schoolmaster rapping his desk for atten ? tion ? is that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and South to control the entire central European zone and therefore to dominate Europe . " A formidable affirmation , with a seductive charm for the mili ? tarsmninded 1 They have been carried off their feet by dozens of similar asseverations , often enough presented under the name of " laws , " as if they were the legislative acts of some ruler of the universe . A half score will occur at once to every reader , as , for instance , that Antwerp is a pistol aimed at England 's heart , that Constantinople means the rule of the world , that the Monroe Doctrine is the only guarantee of the independence of the United States . Let us be fair ; speculative deductions from recurrent situa ? tions are entirely legitimate , but when they grossly manipu ? late the facts , they fall by their dead weight into the meretricious class of pseudo-history . And of all pseudo - histories the infallible mark is this : that in them history has lost its innocence .
