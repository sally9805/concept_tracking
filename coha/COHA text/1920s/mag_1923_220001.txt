To Train for Success is to Invite Bankruptcy <P> The private school , says John Dewey , may exist for such special training as it pleases , but the public school must serve the purpose of the community as a whole . Hence it must teach " those subjects which are found to be , first , necessary , and , secondly , highly useful in serving this purpose of developing good citizenship , industrial and political , for leisure as well as for work , good members of the family and the neighborhood as well as of the political state and the workshop and farm . " <P> The difficulty with this formula is that it makes the present state of society the standard of sound education . Translated into terms of individual education it means that that individual is educated who is prepared for success in the world as it stands . And stated thus the formula partially justifies the point of view of Dean Heilman of the Northwestern University School of Commerce who is reported to have said : " The interest of education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are identical and mutual . Business must rely upon our educational institutions to conduct a large part of the scientific investigation and research , the results of which are broadly utilized in business . Business must depend upon education for teaching , directly or indirectly , all of those who receive any form of schooling . " <P> If there ever was a time when the insecurity of an education based upon success in the preceding generation was apparent , it is now . Children educated in pre-war Russia upon such a scheme would be , and are , helpless in revolutionary Russia . The only education which could conceivably be valuable in a period of violent change would be an education which enabled the individual to so far free himself from the immediate prospect as to orient himself and measure tendencies and probabilities . To train for nothing but success in the present business world is to invite intellectual bankruptcy . There were men of the older generation in England who faced the war on Greek literature better than some of their fellow citizens faced it on the soundest economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the final analysis , " says he , " the power of the student to grasp the essential features of problems is the great differentiation between the educated and the non-educated man . " But it may be said truthfully that the power to know what problems to wrestle with , and when , is a differentiation equally profound . Intense application to the essential features of the problems of violin technique during the combustion of Rome is hardly the mark of a sound education .
