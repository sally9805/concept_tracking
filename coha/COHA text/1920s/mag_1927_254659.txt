Mozart . Where many another impresario has failed , Producer A. H. Woods has succeeded in luring the famed Guitrys ( Sacha Guitry , French actor-playwright , Yvonne Printemps , his actress-wife ) to the U. S. They presented M. Guitry 's Mozart , the same dresden-china play of virginal genius in which Irene Bordoni appeared earlier this season ( TIME , Dec. 6 ) . Though Yvonne Printemps ' radiant personality breathes life into the titular role ( which was created especially for her ) , the play still seems fragile to the point of brittleness . The Guitrys were cordially received but the handicap of dialogue in foreign language militates against their popularity . <P> <P> Peggy-Ann . Aided bv Gilbertian satire , Broadway slapstick , attractive dancers , the pepper of quick wisecracks , the charm of music , Peggy-Ann skipped right up to the head of the class in current musical diversions . Peggy-Ann ( Helen Ford ) , a Cinderella in love with a penniless prince , falls asleep , dreams a crazy romance of department store and Cuban summer resort adventure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In His Arms , " " A Tree in the Park . " Lulu McConnell , stylish stout comedienne , Charlestbns , croons , while pretty Betty Starbuck , as a clownish brat , keeps the audience a-roaring . <P> <P> The Devil in the Cheese ( produced in Pasadena a year ago ) . In Tom Cushing 's play , a piece of cheese before bedtime brings on a good dream in which the secret chambers of a girl 's mind are explored . Everywhere , the seeker finds the radiant image of her lover enshrined in fancy as President of the U. S. , single-handed conqueror of South Sea Island tribes , hero in all things . This sublimated suitor is , in reality , a ship 's steward , opposed by the girl 's father who prefers a colorless favorite of his own choosing . The action unfolds before the fantastic beauty of Norman Bel Geddes ' scenery . The magic of his perspective puts on the stage of a toy theatre , a mountain-top monastery accessible only by hoisting-basket . His heights are dizzy . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not entirely crushed by the method of its whimsey . <P> The Padre is a French peasant-priest . He mingles with the people , drinks with the soldiers , says : " Hell , yes , you bet your sweet life . " An uncouth fellow , given to kissing barmaids in saloons , he is , nevertheless , established as a sterling upright character , for he frowns blackly upon kissing in the salon . When his good-fellowship embroils him in a Parisian night club scandal and the Bishop is about to punish him , the Cardinal pops out from behind the curtain , announces that the padre has a heart of gold . Leo Carillo does the padre , but the real hero is Poilu , high-spirited dog , who wags his tail at the audience , his natural grace left uncropped by the playwright .
