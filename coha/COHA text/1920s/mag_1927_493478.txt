A Financial Path to Peace THIS is an attempt to suggest a compre ? hensive plan of readjustment for the vex ? ing questions of German reparations , Al ? lied and inter-Allied government debts , European appeasement and peace . Many excellent suggestions of readjustment have been made , but , so far as the writer knows , they deal respectively with only one phase of the Euro ? pean situation . Sometimes it is with the settlement and ' disposition of German reparations ; sometimes with the resettlement or cancellation of the Allied ' debts owing the United States ; sometimes the em ? phasis is put upon the necessity for revising the Treaty of Versailles ; and , of course , many plans deal purely with the question of world peace . The central idea of this proposal is to consider all of these , acute questions and problems together ; in other words , to handle them as is done , generally speaking , in the case of a reorganization of a dis ? " tressed railroad or industrial corporation . In re ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rehabilitation and adjustment . The analogy may not be complete , but it is suffi ? sufficiently so for the purpose . When every nation sees what all other nations are to receive , how it is to be treated , and what the general result will be , criti ? cism and distrust are disarmed , and general confi ? dence and harmony are attainable . This is the " open diplomacy " of reorganizations . Settlements have been made by our government with practically all our European debtors except France , which has not ratified the agreement . This article ' does not discuss the wisdom of these settle ? ments , but takes them as facts in the economic prob ? lem . However , it may not be amiss to say that the writer has never been in sympathy with the view that the Great War was originally our war , that we were military partners with the Allies through ? out , and that our loans to them during and after the War were mere contributions to a common cause . Nor has the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " capacity to pay " of a nation over a period of sixty-two years anything short of a wild guess . But the settlements are closed incidents , and we start from them as a base . Suffice it to say that the United States has been liberal in these adjust ? ments , although we have apparently received little or no credit for generosity or even leniency . In 1917 we entered the World War , not only in good ' faith but enthusiastically , " to end war , " that is , to establish durable world peace . While we materially aided in victory for the Allied cause , the vision of world peace is still distant . The purposes of the proposed plan may be sum ? marized as follows : 1 . To get a reasonable compromise in cash for the United States of the " present worth " of the debtsettlements , which will furnish immediate and sub ? stantial relief to our taxpayers who are bearing the whole brunt of the American cost of the War . 2 . To have the German reparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount to be financed by a world consortium of bankers in cooperation with the governments involved , so that Germany may pay adequate reparations and also be able to work out the economic salvation of her people . 3 . To use the proceeds of the financed fixation of German reparations to pay all the sums needed under the proposed plan to bring about the settlement and discharge of all the Allied and inter-Allied govern ? ment debts ; for stabilization of currencies ; for equi ? table adjustments with those European nations having specific claims to German reparations , and for the necessary cost of the loan . 4 . The nations involved to sign a treaty of peace , open to all other civilized nations , wherein there will be substituted for the sixty-two years of debt instal ? ment payments by our European debtors a sixty-two-year experiment in world peace , by the renunciation for that period of the use of war for the settlement of international disputes . In other words , to get also from this adjustment the ideal for which we fought in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ment. 5 . To make such modifications of the Treaty of Versailles as are compatible with the terms and pur ? poses of this proposal . The position taken by President Wilson , that the question of Allied debts should not be considered in conjunction with German reparations , was sound . This view was approved and adopted by the Hard ? ing and Coolidge administrations . At the time this subject was originally broached , it meant two things  - -  first , the making of all payments by the Allies to the United States conditional on the payment to them of reparations by Germany ; and , secondlY , and more important , the United States was asked to take , in payment of the Allied debts , German " C " bonds , third mortgage bonds , all subordinated to the bonds to be given the Allies . This would have put the United States in the position of mili ? tary collector of reparations from Germany , in or ' der to protect our third mortgage bonds , as we would have released the Allies . The proposal here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , the plan provides a complete settlement , wherein the United States would be paid a fair " present worth " compromise of the debt settlements in cash , the reparations would be adjusted and discharged ; and the whole network of Allied and inter-Allied indebtedness would be disentangled and ended . The principal of the Allied ' debts owing t113 United States was about ten billion dollars , which ' with accumulated interest , amounted to about twelve billion dollars . By the lenient settlements made by our ' debt-funding commission and approved by Con congress ( including the unratified French settlement ) , between six and seven billion dollars were , in effect , cancelled , through the omission and reduction of interest over the period of sixty-two years . The " present worth " of the debts owing the United States under the settlements ( that is , the present cash value an expert accountant would give them , assuming that all the instalments will be paid for the sixty-two years ) is , roughly , five billion dollars . The cancellation of six to seven billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five billion dollars , tpitornizes the present Allied debt situation so far as the United States is concerned . Of course , it requires considerable optimism to believe that all these countries will continue to pay their instalments to us over the sixty-two-year period . Even if the nations actually and punctually pay all their instalments , the present generation of our taxpayers will get an almost negligible benefit . For , under these settlements , the instalment payments , and most of the interest ra.tes , . do not begin to be substantial until about twenty-five years from now . But it has been computed that , at the present rate of progress , our own eighteen billion dollars of gov ? ernment debt will all be paid off within twenty-five years . Therefore , the next generation , that will get the benefit of the increased instalment payments and interest rates , will be a generation that nation ? ally is practically free from debt . In other words , American taxpayers will get relief when they do not need relief . There is no good reason why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the War . The proposed plan offers immediate and partial relief to present tax-Payers , and , even so , will accelerate by many years the day when our national war debt will be entirely paid off . In addition to the debt settlements , the United States has a claim of two hundred and fifty million dollars , arising out of our contribution to the Army ef Occupation immediately following the Armistice. e were to have a first lien for these advances , but , for some reason or other , we have not been Paid , so far as the writer knows , anything either en Principal or interest . As the other governments contributing to the Army of Occupation have been Paid , it seems reasonable to propose that this ex ? Pense of the United States , which was incurred for t he benefit of the Allies , and after the War , should be repaid . While , as above stated , the United States hap ? ttlY kept itself free from participation in or collec ? rn of German reparations , nevertheless , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree that Te center and crux are the German reparations . C113 is obviously , true so far as any financial ad atnient is concerned , and it is almost equally true with regard to European appeasement and peace . leeeordingly , this plan proposes that the German ior rations be fixed at the amount of six billion Jars , and that this amount be financed and paidin cash in a lump sum . This would supersede the present method of instalment payments by Germany without knowledge or fixation of the total amount of reparations , and , as the annual payments under the Dawes Plan are rapidly increasing , would ob ? viate the danger of default and consequent serious complications . The effect of the cash settlement of the reparations would be to terminate the quasi-receivership now afflicting Germany , and she would owe six billion dollars under a well secured loan , handled by a world banking consortium working in concert with the governments involved , on a sound and economic basis . As the loan would be a first mortgage on all the national assets and revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 5 percent per annum , with a sinking fund of an addi ? tional 1% percent per annum , or at a total annual cost of 7 percent . This sinking fund of 1 percent , kept alive , would , as banking tables show , automati ? cally pay off the entire principal of the loan in about twenty-eight years . Such a loan would , as stated , have to be under ? taken by an international banking group in coop ? eration with the governments involved . Our Amer ? ican bankers would , doubtless , be willing to under ? write and distribute a proper and proportionate share of the loan . The financial task would , of course , be colossal , but far from impossible , with the momentum of public approval and consequent investment . It would , indeed , be a reassuring reve ? lation if a loan of such magnitude , easily possible in war-time , when loans are necessarily precarious , could be negotiated in peace-time , for constructive purposes , when the safety of the loan is beyond question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ernment would receive in cash , out of the proceeds of the new German loan , four billion two hundred and fifty million dollars . The four billion dollars represent the " present worth " cash compromise of the Allied debt settlements . Otherwise stated , we would accept in compromise of the five billion dol ? lars , which is the estimated " present worth " of the debt settlements , 80 percent thereof in immediate cash ? a discount of 20 percent . The two hundred and fifty million dollars would be repayment of the principal of our contribution to the Army of Occu ? pation . The four billion dollars of cash could be used immediately in reduction of our own national debt , and , by the time of its consummation , would probably mean a reduction of 25 percent thereof . This large reduction in our national debt , quite in ? dependently of surpluses , would justify an imme ? diate and substantial reduction in our federal taxes . The two hundred and fifty million dollars could be utilized , if so desired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appropriation for ( ) arm relief under sat ? isfactory legislation . The plan also provides that there be a general cleaning up and discharge of the Allied and inter-Allied war debt all around . The United States is ' 63 THE NEW the only clear creditor , we having paid our way as we went along in the War . Great Britain is a creditor as to her other Allies , but is a debtor to the United States in the sum of about four and a half billion dollars . As a part of this proposal , Great Britain would be called upon to cancel the debts owing to her by her Allies ? about seven billion dollars . In turn , she would receive a release from the United States as to her own debt . This , in effect , Great Britain has heretofore offered to do . Under this proposal , there would be no need of continued friction or even conference about the French debt settlement . All the debts would be settled and discharged , including France 's . Dis ? regarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion dollars , including four hundred million dollars for materials purchased after the War , and she owes nearly three billion dollars to Great Britain ; Italy owes us over two billion dol ? lars , and a similar amount to Great Britain ; Bel ? gium owes us four hundred and twenty millions ; Rumania , forty-five millions ; Czechoslovakia , one hundred and fifteen millions ; Latvia , six millions ; Finland , nine millions ; Poland , one hundred and seventy-eight millions ; Greece , about twenty mil ? lions ; Esthonia , fourteen millions ; and Lithuania , six millions . And these latter countries also owe similarly large amounts to Great Britain . Thus most of the countries in Europe would have a direct financial stake in this general adjustment. * The two hundred million dollars borrowed by Germany to inaugurate the Dawes Plan should be paid off out of the six billion dollars , so that the new loan would be an absolute first mortgage on all of Germany 's national property . This would leave a balance of five billion eight hundred million dol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four billion two hundred and fifty million dollars would leave a balance of one billion five hundred and fifty million dollars . This balance would be available , as far as needed , for stabilization of currencies , for equitable adjustments with those European nations having specific claims to German reparations , and for the necessary cost of the loan . The unused por ? tion , if any , of the one billion five hundred and fifty million dollars to be applied in reduction of the loan . As a part of the general appeasement , the European nations involved , as well as the United States , are to sign a general treaty in which the use of war for the settlement of international disputes would be renounced for the next sixty-two years , as an international experiment in world peace . The other civilized nations to be invited to join in this treaty , so that for the period of sixty-two years the institution of war as a method of settling the dis ? putes of the nations may be outlawed , and a judicial system set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons , the writer has left out all consideration of the Russian debts . Personally , he would like to see them in ? corporated , if it can be done without friction and , therefore , with ? out endangering the proposal . // tem which has brought Europe to its present plight . Thus the European nations , instead of endUring sixty-two years of " financial servitude , " would en ? joy sixty-two years of voluntary peace , during which time their economic rehabilitation could be effected and made secure . If , toward the end of the sixty-two-year period , the experiment in peace proves dis ? tasteful to the civilized nations , and they hunger for military power , they could revive the war system by refusing to extend the term of the peace treaty beyond the sixty-two years . Such a treaty would make possible and desirable the provision of this plan , which calls for a world conference on the reduction of armaments , both on land and sea , to signalize the general renuncia ? tion of war . For so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lawful and para ? mount " court of last resort , " all hopes of disarma ? ment are doomed to disappointment . But , with war renounced for sixty-two years , all obstacles to ' drastic disarmament would be removed , and the economic convalescence and rehabilitation of the countries of Europe would ensue by leaps and bounds . It is obvious that , in order to carry out the fore ? going plan , changes would have to be made in the Treaty of Versailles in accordance therewith , and such other changes as may be agreed upon , in har ? mony with the spirit and compact of the nations to live together in amity and peace and to devote themselves to the progress and welfare of their re ? spective peoples . This proposal is not submitted as a finality nor as having the magic of an Aladdin 's lamp . The writer will be both surprised and disappointed if many important and beneficent suggestions . and amendments are not forthcoming ; and he will be abundantly repaid if this proposal stimulates or aids , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rnent and peace . The following is a summary of this plan : This balance of $r , 55o,000,000 to be used for stabiliza ? tion of currencies , for equitable adjustments with European nations having specific claims to German reparations , and for the neccessary cost of the loan . The unused balance , If any , to be applied in reduction of the loan . Great Britain to cancel all debts owing to her by her allies , amounting to about seven billion dollars , so that all Allied and inter-Allied government debts will be wiped out . The nations to sign a general treaty renouncing war as a method of settling their disputes for the next sixty-two years , and agreeing to set up a judicial system to supplant the outworn and destructive war system , as an epoch-making experiment in world peace . Drastic limitation of armaments , both land and sea , through a conference of all nations based on the sixty-two-year treaty outlawing war . Treaty of Versailles to be modified in accordance with the needs and spirit of the foregoing proposal .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
