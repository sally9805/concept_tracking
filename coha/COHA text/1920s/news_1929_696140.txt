txt Ambassador Gibson 's statement of the Amen-can government 's views of the international armament situation and of its particular disposition with respect to the present negotiations will have , we think , the approval of preponderant American opinion . Whether the signing of the Kellogg treaty indicated any such change In the practical approach of European governments to the complicated problem of armament reduction , as Mr. Gibson pointedly suggested to the conference , remains to be seen . But to have failed to make reference to it would have been a rather significant hint of our own lack of faith in the treaty or at least in the sincerity of the signatory governments . But while the treaty , if it represents a reality in terms of practical statesmanship , ought to permit a more confident and thorough dealing with the problem of reduction , it does not dispose of the fact of existing armament nor lessen the difficulties of adjustment Our own concern in any possible scheme of limitation is for the maintenance of our relative strength and the formulas adopted will be judged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forethought and negotiated without foresight The result , whatever the immediate compensations , was drastically to lower our relative position among naval powers , and it should be clear to the present conference that , bound as we are by the explicit commitments made by the Washington conventions , they do not imply satisfaction with the results or serve as a foundation for our policy in limitation . That was , we trust , sufRcienUy shown at the second conference and may be gathered from Mr. Gibson 's remarks of Monday . No scheme of limitation should be accepted by the United States which does not take full account of our loss of relative strength and permit its correction it we are so disposed . Neither are we interested in any scheme the not result of which would be the increase of present expenditures on armament or the increase of total armament with merely a shifting in categories .

The attempt at the second conference to impose upon us a limit in categories essential in our strategic situation while leaving other powers free to build freely to meet their own may have been natural in view of our failure at the Washington conference to understand or conserve our own interests , but it has put ' even the casual indifferent American public on its guard , and Mr. Gibson and his colleagues may be assured of a decisive public opinion to support a candid and alert protection of American interests while working for our general object of armament reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of reduction , supposing that it is equitably accomplished in due time , it might be well for us to realize that as we all proceed to cut down naval armament and reduce the power of professional armed force we increase the importance of other elements of maritime power . As the warship dwindles in force and number the merchant ship increases in military importance and a people that possesses greater natural resources in necessary material , in organizing ability and experience and in inventive faculty and initiative than its rivals will have greater reltdive strength , greater , perhaps , than its policy or circumstances might have permitted under the regime of professional armament A people lacking in these resources might conceivably be willing to bear the burden of an organized defense relatively stronger than a neighbor possessing greater natural resources , but less willingness to make the sacrifice involved In the main ' tenance of armament .
