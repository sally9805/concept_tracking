When anyone 's hands blister playing golf it means that the player is just learning the game or that he has not played for a long time . Walter Hagen , after one day 's practice in England where he had gone to play Archie Compston a match for $3,750 , got a big water blister on the pad of flesh at the base of the little finger of his right hand . One English sports writer said that the match ought to be postponed . Hagen wanted it postponed himself . He explained that he had come all the way from Los Angeles in twelve days , and that except for that one day at Moor Park he had n't had any practice except a few balls which he drove off the roof of his hotel into the Thames , and that he had been acting in the cinema all winter . Told that he would have to play anyway , he hired a detective to get him out of bed on time . <P> Two years ago , Hagen kept Abe Mitchell waiting half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived he said that he was very sorry , his car had broken down , an explanation that nobody accepted , least of all Mitchell who , exhausted and keyed up by waiting , played badly and was badly beaten . This time Hagen , with a tall detective beside him , got to the course an hour early and waited for Compston . The Englishman laid him a stymie at the first hole , was three up at the fifth ; Hagen sliced his drive into a ditch at the sixth and picked up ; at the seventh Compston outdrove him by 50 yards . Hagen had 148 for the first 36 holes . Compston had 133 . <P> Next day Hagen was better . He had plaster on his blister and he was missing fewer three-foot putts . The crowd , usually annoyed by Hagen 's lolling walk , his smile , his Americanisms , his arrogance , and his frequent cigarets , was cheering him now for being a sport ; when he played out of a bunker at the twelfth , a retired major with an umbrella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hisses of people who were afraid his enthusiasm would disturb Hagen 's putting . The match ended at the 55th hole with Hagen 18 down .
