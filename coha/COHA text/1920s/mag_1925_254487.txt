The Evening Standard , London journal , telegraphed to Florence to ask if Mme. Luisa Tetrazzini would sing from London to millions of intuned British radiophiles . The London newspaper also mentioned a few neat words about the remuneration ; current rumor said it was the highest fee that she had ever received for a single performance . <P> Said Mme. Tetrazzini to The Evening Standard , " I shall come , nor shall any obstacle , even the Italian railways , be too great . " Forthwith- that is to say , as soon as her trunks had been packed , accommodations reserved , her voice tested , the servants instructed , telegrams despatched , tickets bought and after a great deal more excitement and fussing had worn the edge off several days- she set out for the two-day trip to London . <P> At London , she explained in her inimitable way that she had come " just like that " ( she imitated a butterfly with her fat fingers ) . " Indeed , how could she resist the temptation to sing to her carissimi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden , 18 years ago . At that time , she had already enjoyed triumphs in Italy , in Mexico , in Buenos Aires , where the enraptured citizens had fired off cannon and drawn her carriage , snowed under with flowers , through the streets . But Covent Garden was the test stronghold of musical recognition and , though she had sung Lucia over 200 times , her large , dimpled knees , she freely admitted , trembled on that night . After the first act , they trembled no longer ; for the Inglesi made her appear 20 times before the curtain , clapping her long , and even cheering her in their funny , diffident way . Later that evening , the famed Patti told her : " You have won by merit the crown that I have laid aside . " <P> Facing the microphone last week , her ample form clad in costly fabrics and bedecked with jewels , she sang most appropriately like a nightingale while a vast mass of British , overestimated at 10,000,000 , postponed their bedtime story to listen to the sob-strains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tetrazzini , not strong but of great resonance , was peculiarly suited to the radio . Her singing was rebroadcasted to all the British stations and was heard by enthusiasts on the Continent . Many vainly hoped that the U. S. coastal stations would pick up the tremoring wave lengths , as they did those of a jazz concert at the Hotel Savoy , London , a few days later . <P> Oscar Hammerstein , helped by the weather , persuaded Tetrazzini to leave London and come to Manhattan in 1908 . It was a wet week in London . Tetrazzini was depressed , idle . Hammerstein had tea with her . She returned with him , sang three successful seasons at the Manhattan Opera House , Manhattan , for which she received $2,500 a performance . She afterwards sang with the Metropolitan , the Boston Opera Company- " gala seasons " all . Her last U. S. appearance was in Trenton in May , 1921- a concert with which she ended a prolonged tour . Since , she has sung occasionally here and there , but for the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her recently published autobiography .
