One Alden L. Putnam , employe of the Motor Wheel Corporation of Lansing , Mich. , traveled home , last week , from California . Looking out of the car window , he watched the automobiles going by , gaunt roadsters with battered mudguards , smug sedans with shiny spokes , nobby runabouts , sumptuous limousines , frail flivvers . Putnam looked at their tires . So many of them were rolling along on squashy , bulbous " balloons , " the latest fashion and economy in motor tirings . <P> Putnam was sad at heart because he had flown the theory of the balloon tire-low pressure , broad carrying surface , resilient fabric-before the automotive industry as early as 1920 , had been laughed at , called " a character . " He had persisted in his theory , applied for U.S. patents covering the idea . Now motordom was using balloon tires but he had not got his patents . <P> Before he reached his home in Detroit , Putnam heard that Washington had awarded him his patents , three basic ones covering the balloon principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so did his employers . The latter hold the manufacturing rights . Legal machinery was swiftly put in action to recover millions of dollars in royalties due from tire manufacturers on their sales of the past two years . Newspapers headlined : " Fortune Awaits Flouted Creator of Balloon Tires . " <P> But the press also headlined : " Akron to Declare Balloon Tire War . " Officials of the Firestone , Miller , Goodrich and other rubber companies maintained that Putnam 's patents could , should , would be successfully protested . They declared that the U S. Patent Office must be behind the times in its knowledge of the development of the cord tire , first imported from England by Goodrich some years ago and said to embody the basic virtues of the balloon .
