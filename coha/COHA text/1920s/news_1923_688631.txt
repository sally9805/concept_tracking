txt The British Debt Funding bill will be passed by the Senate this week , probably Friday afternoon . This was indicated late today , when Senator Robinson . on behalf of the Democrats , informed Senator Smoot that he would be ready to consider a unanimous consent agreement for a vote when the Senate convenes tomorrow . Senator Robinson added that he expected no trouble in reaching an agreement for a vote on Friday . The bill is certain to pass by a large Majority , getting the ; support of probably half the Democratic Senators , largely because the Republican leaders agreed today to accept an amendment of Senator Robinson , which would limit the pending bill to the agreement with Great Britain and provide that agreements with other debtor nations must have the assent of Congress . Senator Lodge , who opened the debate today , said the American Commission had sought to ascertain what Great Britain would be able to pay and had then proceeded to arrive at an agree-. ment that was just to both parties . " It seems to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was incurred by both political parties and is a debt of ' the United States , it should be settled now by the action of both parties and for the best interests of the entire country .. " Assuming that we have no intention of collecting the debt by force from , Great Britain , I think we gain by this settlement a very large sum of money . The time of maturity of the debt , I know , is long , but we are placing on Posterity a large share of the debt we incurred in the World War . So it could not be otherwise than agreeable to posterity when we are handing them down the great debt which they must meet , that we should also hand down to them a steady amount on one of the settlements , amounting to more ' than $4,600 , - 000,000 , which they will from year to year receive . " Great Britain has a profound interest in the settlement of this debt which may be called selfish , but which , I think , goes far beyond her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain her credit and to do so she must make heavy sacrifices , and that undoubtedly plays an important part in her determination to pay this debt . And the maintenance of British credit is to the interest of all the world . I believe the settlement of this debt will be of the utmost benefit in stabilizing world conditions and have far reaching effect for good on business everywhere . " Underwood Favors the Bill . Senator Underwood , the Democratic leader , spoke fop- the bill , saying : " I think this settlement Is a reasonable one and it should be approved by the Senate . The most serious question before the world today is the chaotic condition of international finance , and until this financial situation is cleared up there can be no real prosperity in the world . We are part and parcel of the economic structure of the world and when there is distress in Europe that distress is reflected here . " Great Britain comes to us , asking us to make a new contract on a peacetime basis . Now the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of peace . In view of the financial situation . I think the rate proposed is both fair and just " . Senator Ransdell of Louisiana also favored the bill . He declared this was no trme for the United States to adopt a " pound of flesh policy in dealing with- the nations allied with us in the great war . " Senator Borah said-in part : " I have no desire to see the Government drive a hard bargain with reference to these debts , either the debt with I which we are now dealing or any of the debts which we may hereafter come to deal . If the debt question before us be Considered purely as a question of collecting or arranging for the collection of . so much money , I have no doubt , as stated by the Senator from Alabama , Mr. Underwood , that a very reasonable settlement has been made . " however , I ha looked upon these debts as only one item in the whole subject matter of economic readjustment in Europe . I know , as one may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and of all the people who were engaged upon the side of the Allies ? as a matter of fact , upon the part of all the people of **  --  that anything this country may do in the way of El . generous settlement or adjustment of these matters may well be taken into consideration . I would deal with Europe with her sad condition in mind . America No Shylock , Says Borah . " But I am bound to say that , notwithstanding all these facts , this is an extraordinarily generous settlement . Never again ought a voice to ' be raised in England or elsewhere that we are'a harsh ; bargain-riving. people . How much better wo6ld it have been for all the world had the policy of the President . Mr. Wilson . been adopted by all the nations interested in the war . To my mind , when the whole transaction is viewed and the environments under which we operated are considered , it . was the moss unselfish that ever characterized a nation engaged in war . I call attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to understand that we are not driving a harsh bargain , after all . As a result of the war , Great . Britain and France aequierd combined territory of 2,486,000 square miles . or within 540789 square miles as large as the Continental United States . It may be said that some of that territory is a burden , but it was not so considered when it was acquired . Britain acquired 2,000,000 square ? miles of territory , while France has acquired a piece of territory the richest in industrial possibilities in all Europe  --  the Sarre Valley  --  for a term of years , which under the present program will not be a term of years , but all time . Besides this , France acquired colonial possessions of 480,495 square miles . No one- can estimate the wealth of this territory . The oil and mineral deposits in these war-acquired territories are rich beyond measure and , as I have said , that territory was , left to be divided I among the AllieS . the- United Statesi coming home without . claiming any parcel or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States ' appear . the Shylobk of the war . " Now another feature of the situation . t The amount paid by Germany in cash ' and kind has been 81,900,000,000 ; settle-1 ments of private clehts - $150,000,000 , besides other expenses totalling many mil- ! lions of dollars . " " Ti NEW YOR/C TIMES stated the other day , " interrupted Senator Nelson . " that a little more than $2,000,000,000 had been paid in reparations by Germany and that the French had expended more than 87,000,000.000 in restoring those parts of her country devastated by the Germans . In other words , for what has cost the people of France $7,000. - 000,000 , they have only gotten money and property to the value of $2,000 , - 000,000 , leaving i$5,000,000,000 still unpaid . " " That has very little relevancy to what I am saying . It does not controvert what I have said , " replied Senator . Borah . " It does not contradict what the Senator has said , " answered Senator Nelson . " but the Senator should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " I am dealing with the proposition of what our allies have received , " replied Mr. Borah. ? ? while the United States , at the same time Is being charged with driving a harsh bargain . - in calling for a settlement of a debt at 31/2 per cent . interest . No longer should it be said that we have driven a hard bargain , for we have not . " Reed Clashes With Smoot . A discordant note was sounded by Senator Reed of Vissouri . He called the settlement unfair to the United States and declared that for sixty-two years to come the United States would be a partner in all the financial difficulties which might beset Great Britain . " The American Debt Funding Commission has proceeded in defiance of the law and in defiance of Congress , " he asserted . At one point he declared that Secretary Mellon'had " fixed up a job " on the British debt . This Senator Smoot Indignantly denied , saying that all the members of the American Commission share responsibility with Mr. Mellon for the plan before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't find private financiers with great European debts on their hands signing any such dirty . Paper ' as this ? an agreement that is in defiance of the law passed by Congress : " Senator Smoot promptly denied that the settlement . was in defiance of law since Congress had power to reject or approve the arrangement .
