The sea , like the breath of mythical and playful goddesses , goes to the heads of worldlings . It gives them an inexplicable grandeur , a constant vibration between excitement and ease , a strange language . Take , for example , the events at Santander , Spain , on the Bay of Biscay during the last three weeks . King Alfonso XIII went there to join his queen and children . Yachts and warships speckled the harbor . There were receptions in the Magdalena Palace , dances in the clubs , frolicking townsfolk and tourists everywhere . U. S. Ambassador Ogden H. Hammond came down from Madrid . There was a short yacht race ; the Queen trounced the King , and the infantes Gonzalo and Jaime finished in the rear ; General Don Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja , Marques de Estella , Duque de Ajdur and Dictator of Spain , a spectator , laughed softly on the deck of another ship . . . . At the Maritime Club it was reported that one of the yachts from the U. S. had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the bay . Twenty minutes later , he came back and shouted through a megaphone : " It 's only a tourist 's yacht . Good jest . " <P> But on another day His Majesty had an opportunity to climb aboard the Nina and say : " I am the King of Spain , " to which young Elihu Root Jr . of Manhattan replied : " We had recognized Your Majesty . " Nina , tiniest of all the yachts and first to finish in the race from New York to Santander , won the Queen 's cup for boats of less than 55 feet waterline length . She had crossed the Atlantic in 24 days . Said her skipper . Paul Hammond : " We carried all the sail we could , but we did not drive the yacht and we shortened sail whenever the weather was heavy . "
