txt With forty eight hours gone and no sign apparent that any headway has been made in tracing the assassins of Don R. Mellett , publisher of The Canton Daily News , killed supposedly by agents of the underworld he fought unreltntingly to the day of his death , 100 prominent Citizens , officers of various social and civic clubs , have been asked to meet tomorrow morning by William  --  Kuhns . President of the Canton Chamber of Commerce , to " consider action . " Not an arrest has been made , though State , Federal and local officials are supposedly seeking clues to the identity of the slaYer or slayers who fired the deadly volley from the darkness as Mellett stood at the door of . his garage . On the tongues of those met on street corners and in hotel lobbies one name is mentioned when the murder of Mellett is discussed . This name , according to old residents , has been on the lips of every Cantonian for sixteen years and more , as the " King of the Jungle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the citY. , Yet this man has not been called before Police Chief Lengel for examination , although other denizens of his realm have . Asked this afternoon why he had not called this man in , Chief Lenget shrugged his shoulders and said : " We have n't a thing on him . So , if we arrested him we ourseives could be prosecuted for false arrest . " In practically every church in Canton this morning a petition was circalated repudiating the Police Department and asking for a full investigation by agents to be appointed by the Governor . " We believe that action on your part is necessary to protect the fair name of our city , to protect the lives , property and society of our citizens and to protect the foundation of our form of government , " said the petition . Hundreds signed it and it was wired to Governor Donahey . Revenge Motive , Says Slater .. Ora Slater , detective of renown throughout this section because of his solving of the Nesibitt bath tub murder last night and who has been retained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murder independently of the local police , spent most of the day in conference with McClintock , Safety Director Hexamer and Judge C. Pontius , Mellett 's friend and legal adviser . He made a preliminary survey of the " Jungle " district along South Cherry Avenue and of the equally tough region along Carnahan Avenue on the other side of the town . He also talked with Mrs. Mellett and other members of the family . Tonight he announced that he had definitely narrowed possible motives for the crime down to that of revenge . " After an impartial survey I am convinced that this killing was not done out of any of the usual motives that lead to murder . By that I mean that it had nothing to do with jealousy over hidden love affairs and that it was not the result of a personal qua rrel . " The only motive left is that of revenge on the part of persons who were deeply affected by Mr. Mellett 's editorials and other news comment . The people that he attacked on the pages of his newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elsewhere in this State the underworld is divided generally into four classes . There are those running liquor , those selling it In speak-easies , the gamblers and the organized vice promoters . The man who shot Mellett was one of these four classes . " Awake to Real Situation . Now that .. iellett is dead this little Midwestern city has awakened to the real situation confronting it . With Mellett alive and proclaiming in daily streamers that the roads between here and Akron or Pittsburg ? were jammed with illicit liquor transports , that the police were declining to arrest known narcotic peddlers and that speak-easies frequented by women were allowed to flourish almost at the doorsteps of decent homes , a constant menace to young people . the citizens read the charges with indifference . Even when Mellett was shot to death the first reaction was , " So they got Mellett , eh ? Well , it was bound to come . " But now the better sort of Canton residents are flaring mad and are pro- , claiming the fact in public statements . Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the time the mysterious bullet ended the young publisher 's life , is retorting with statements that injure the civic pride . " Conditions are just as bad in any I other town in Ohio , " is his defense . Angered by Pollee Attitude . Chief Lengel 's response to the charges laid against him and the Police Department is virtually to tell the people of Canton that they are a tough lot and get what they deserve . I lie has made public what purports to be a statistical record of arrests . There were 18,000 in Canton during 1925 , according to these figures , and 9,617 so far in 1926 . In other words , there was one arrest for about every six citizens of the city last year . While more than half of these , 10,853 , were for traffic law violations , there remained 2,240 for drunkenness , 640 for violating the prohibition law , 494 for gambling , 18 for maintaining disorderly houses and 56 for selling narcotics . Looking back over Mellett 's record , it is seen that directly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safety landed in the penitentiary , as did two bootleggers associated with him ; that a Mayor of Canton was removed from office ; that when the police asserted there was no " dope ring " in Canton , Mellett went to the Federal authorities in Cleveland and two days later three Canton narcotic peddlers were actually arrested and pleaded guilty . A tour down South Cherry Avenue and into the " Jungle " reveals even in daylight streets of distasteful aspect . There are rows of " barber shops , " Greek " restaurants " and " hotels " which the residents of Canton point out by more applicable names . In front of shed-like houses one sees expensive closed cars . There is a similar section on the other side of the town near the steel mills . While the root of evil is traced to the " Jungle , " the branches have grown to take in , at various times , the entire political structure of the Municipal Government . And here it is possible to be specific , because many of the outgrowths are a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents of Stark County . Conditions Mellett Attacked . The conditions which Mellett sought to eliminate first arose in 1921 , ? soon after the appointment by Mayor C. C. Curtis of his brother , E. E. Curtis , to the post of Safety Director . E. E. Curtis appointed Lengel , then a desk lieutenant , to be Chief of Police , but took over the Chief 's work himself , assigning patrolmen to their beats , literally running the department and participating in liquor and vice raids . In a few months rumors were rampant that the Safety Director in his supposedly offensive dealings against the bootleggers was making financial profit for himself . Prosecutor C. E. McClintock instituted a Grand Jury investigation of the Police Department , but achieved no definite results . The outcome was a split in the local Republican Party . A delegation of Canton ministers and members of the Anti-Saloon League called on Governor Donahey to remove both the Mayor and the Safety Director . But the Governor declined to act . In 1923 Curtis ran for Mayor again , opposing a dissenting element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a storm of protest when he reappointed his brother Safety Director . Delegation after delegation traveled to Columbus , and finally Governor Donahey decided that action was required . He held a hearing . One faction charged the Mayor with graft and I other forms of collusion and the Mayor ' retorted that he was the victim of a frame-up . The Governor removed Mayor Curtis , and Charles Ball , Presivlent of , the Councils took office at Mayor for the remainder of the term . He immediately dismissed the Safety Director , and the community breathed a sigh of relief , believing its dififculties at an end . But soon came the filing of charges against Police Captain Ben Clark , who had been a leader in the fight against the Curtises and who , to the not unbounded surprise of Cantonians , was accused of receiving " hush money " from certain bottleggers . When the dust had cleared away , E. E. Curtis , Harry Bouklias and Harry Turner were under indictment as bootleggers . Prosecutor McClintock drew evidence from Bouklias and Turner that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ten years . Bouklias and Turner pleaded guilty and were put on parole for five years without imprisonment . Then Mellett , who had come from Indianapolis as business manager of The Daily News and had succeeded to the publishership , began to irritate various people . Bouklias and Turner had not been out of court very long before Mellett was printing stories that they were actively engaged in the liquor business despite their parole . Bouklias , the articles related , handled a raw alcohol business , collecting , by some mysterious means , 30 cents on every gallon of liquor distributed by a third person to speakeasies . Also , he told his contributors just how much they were to buy from this third party , and when they fell short , it seemed that somehow or other a police raid came their way and they found themselves in jail . In the accumulation of evidence against Bouklias and Turner , John ( " Jiggs " ) Wise , a police sergeant , who had risen from Corporal to Captain in the World War , had been invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction that sent the two to prison . Kizman 's house burned to the ground soon afterward . Mellett employed private detectives and kept in touch with friends in the Police Department , among them Sergeant Wise . When Wise told a story of how he had frustrated an attempt by brother police officers to " frame " Kizman , Mellett printed it . According to Wise , he had been sent on a false tip to the northwestern part of the city , had dashed to Kizman 's house in the opposite direction on a hunch of his own , and had found policemen assisting in putting a five-gallon crock of alcohol on Kizman 's porch . Revealed Narcotic Sales . Mellett also went into details in print when Sergeant Wise raided the apartment of a prominent alleged bootlegger and , when the case came to trial , found that there was a third party to swear that he , and not the alleged bootlegger , owned the contraband . Wise asserted he had locked a quart of Scotch found in the apartment in his locker at police headquarters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Istlellett'e stories of such happenings caused the town to seethe . Chief Lengel , who is accused by Mellett 's family of being " responsible " for the murder , and who has not made a single arrest in the forty-eight hours since it occurred , was the chief object of Mellett 's onslaughts . Mellett asserted , on the strength of evidence collected by his own detectives , after charging the police with ncordpeteney , that a narcotic ring was operating In Canton . Chief Lengel and many private citizens shrugged their shoulders and talked about " yellow journalism . " Mellett went to the Federal narcotic authorities in Cleveland and arrests resulted which revealed the systematic transportation of " dope " among Cleveland , Akron , Canton and other midOhio cities . Mellett testified personally , before the Federal Grand Jury . Of the twelve who were arrested three pleaded guilty and went to the penitentiary . There were many other such incidents , the flame alternately flaring and dying . But never since last Thanksgiving , when several dozen members of the Police Department received each a fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. " has there been any real peace . Mellett had been active as business manager of The News for about a year at that time ? and had just assumed the position of publisher . When the turkey episode came out Sergeant Wise announced he had learned that " H. B. " stood for Harry Bouklias , whom The News was then accusing of violation of parole . " Who Got a Turkey ? " The News published daily a box in a prominent place headed , " Who Got a Turkey ? " Then came , " I Did Not , " and an invitation to members of the Police Department to subscribe their signatures . Several did . Chief Lengel said he had returned the turkey sent to him and bad a receipt . Curtis was beaten in the Fall ' election . Mayor Swarth , who , succeeded him , summarily dismissed Lenge ) , after a hearing , at which the chief presented a receipt for the returned turkey , dated two days after Millett 's turkey stories began . The hearing aroused Canton to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five detectives were suspended with the chief . He , however , immediately appealed his case to the Civil Service Commission , comprising three men , J. W. Burris , Price Janson and James Allardice . Burris and Jansen , after a hearing which lasted two weeks , with 100 witnesses and startling evidence , voted that Lengel should be reinstated , and so he was . The Mayor refused to accept the ruling of the commission and carried his fight to the Common Pleas Court , where he lost . He was compelled to accept Lengel again as chief , but last week announced be would bring the case up again before the Civil Service Commission . In this he has just been frustrated , by an injunction obtained in the Common Pleas Court by Burris and Jansen , restraining the Mayor from conducting a hearing . The Mayor , backed by thousands of those disgusted with the present regime , is now planning to appeal for dissolution of the injunction , which , while temporary , because of court schedules , is good until September .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
