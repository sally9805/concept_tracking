In Brooklyn last week for the first time since 1867 , when the New York state legislature passed a statute forbidding cruelty to animals , a doctor was convicted for violation of the law . <P> The doctor was David H. Shelling , who has been trying to determine the relation between dietary restrictions and bone formation at the Jewish Hospital in Brooklyn . <P> Last spring the superintendent of the Humane Society of New York visited the hospital . In Dr. Shelling 's laboratory he found a mongrel dog ( mostly fox terrier ) with her muzzle strapped shut with adhesive tape . The dog 's name was Nellie . She could not eat , drink or lick her wounds . That was cruelty , decided the humane society agent who forthwith had Experimenter Shelling arrested . David Belais , president of the humane society , raged ; altered his will to cut off the Jewish Hospital from a legacy . His wife , Diana Belais , is president of the Anti-Vivisection Society of New York . <P> Magistrate Charles Haubert of Brooklyn knew not what allowances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Shelling 's scientific experiments ; found him guilty ; suspended sentence .
