By Charles L. O'Donnell , C.S.C. $1 . " I bring this weight of savage singing here , Fitting for you who feast upon fierce things . " O N this austere note Rose O'Neill opens one of the significant volumes of American poetry . Not for her the formality of kempt verse : in The Sonnet Begs Me she names her role " To lift for night 's sweet thieves my houseless horn In broken rhythms of the windy grass . " Such golden utterance merits a title from the most golden-tongued of all our poets . The collection contains more than a score of poems of such amazing beauty and strength that they push outward the bourn of English singing . In these , she stands within that place of savage enchantment sung in Kubla Khan . To say that she is at once established as a leading American poet of today is less true than untrue . She is as American and as much of today as the wind : and no more . She is a sport , a freak : dateless , eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing come : half of her body is in the earth ; up through it tremble the sweet dark whispers that once made faun and gnome and slant-eyed Pan and uncouth earthshaking Titan . Often at her best she is mad : a madness as inspired as Blake 's , a lucid possession . " The wind was full of withered leaves , The golden and the red ; They cried to one who hid his eyes , Follow the flying dead . " ' Come loose your soul from off the bough Where it doth hang and sigh , And give it to the long-maned wind And see your dead soul fly . " ' And loose your heart from off the stem Where it doth pulse and pale , And on the sea of running air Let your dead heart sail . " Tor only the dead are travelers , ' The wild leaves sang and said . " ' Follow , follow , follow , Follow the flying dead ! ' " More powerful , in their sustained magic , are long pieces like The Wind Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Went By , The Eagle Hunter , The Returned . For sheer lyric sanity , she gives us Established : " I made a house of houselessness , A garden of your going : And seven trees of seven wounds You gave me , all unknowing : I made a feast of golden grief That you so lordly left me , I made a bed of all the smiles Whereof your lip bereft me : I made a sun of your delay , Your daily loss , his setting : I made a wall of all your words , And a lock of your forgetting . " It is profanation not to quote further ; yet the book is your best mine , to find your own gold . We must mention Mea Culpa , The Maker 's Stealth , And Few There Are , I Made a Little Eater , The Candle . We must forego mentioning Owl Sinister , The Crying Hearts , and a score of worthy others . We can not forego giving the savage splendor of her The Gift : " Now that I am lame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shorn , And the banner torn ; I bring thee , lord , The shattered sword . Take the tattered fool , Take the broken tool , Take the last offense , This ruined insolence ! " At her height , she is untouchable . It must be remembered that her singing-ground is always the ghoul-haunted woodland ; there is no rounded vision of life here . Be it her blame that she has given us no dirge on the death of the first Mrs. Wilson , no ode on the opening of the Panama Canal , no rhapsody on the election of Harding or Hylan . She is master-mistress of one wild field , in which her words and her magnificent drawings are supreme . Apparently these poems have not been published in magazines , although their treasure-trove has been known to many of our singers , who wear a faint accolade spun of her glory . This umbrella from the July sun of immediate criticism has helped keep her out of the current of modern poetical thinking , or she would have spared us " I heav-ed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and other interred Keatsianisms . The mis-indentation practiced in The Bed , The Roads , and elsewhere is something an uninspired adept in poetics could have corrected . Lastly , she lacks the selective faculty , somewhat as Vachel Lindsay lacks it , which explains the pyrites among the more precious ore . But she nods so little , in the large , that we may consider ourselves blessed to have her , and our literature richer for her savage ancient ecstasy . John Hall Wheelock has established his peculiar province in American singing  --  the high air of sheer ecstasy . It is the mood of Sunrise and The Marshes of Glynn ; it is the mood of the bird-song in Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking ; it is a mood almost silent , save for these examples , in our earlier singing , and heard too infrequently now . His former volume , " Dust and Light , " contained poem after poem that mounted in breathless rapture to a crescendo of wide rhythmic beauty . There is one poem , The Divine Fantasy , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . It builds from a noble introduction " Life 's flag advances on the starry way , And Consciousness , still battling , still at bay , Holds the bright forts against Oblivion . " Poetry is no more than bright forts against oblivion . From this exalted mood the climb is to the humbler wonder of the night-noises of earth . Some one has defined genius as the power to make analogies ; the poem is strong with such startling images as " Hunger , the shadow cast by death " ; and with beauty like : " Now in the rain-drenched wood The tree-toad drinks the rain and finds it good , And trills for joy . . . and the little mouse Furtively hurries through the lane , his eye Turned up in terror as the owl goes by . . . Ecstasy of the firefly that trails Among the shadows where the starlight fails His body 's burning love . Forever flows The dreadful drama to its stately close And endless ending  --  the fierce carnival Of death and passion , wherein each and all Mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass Each into other  --  the high poem that has No end and no beginning . " The concluding apostrophe is as deep a note as he has ever sung . Minute observation of nature , transmuted into sheer poetrythis it has to a marked degree . His song is at flood-tide in such a piece as Sea Horizons : " As bread that for my daily fare is broken , The eternal loveliness before me spread ? Unutterable gesture  --  word unspoken , In the proud silences forever said ! " The sun puts forth his strength , the reaches shimmer With inarticulate rapture , and the proud Waters are thrilled ; the fields of ocean glimmer With shifting light and overshadowing cloud . " In human relationships , there are varying notes ; the most wistful is caught in the couplet : " Telling of one upon a hopeless quest How in the dark of Time he lost his way ! " There is majesty in the opening sonnet and the concluding poem ; there is high vision in Night Hath Its Fear , Proud Doom , Blind Players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness is an overdevelopment of the ecstasy , that at times threatens a mere wordlessness ; coupled with a slight tendency to repetitiveness . But his contribution to current singing is a sunique and vital one . Lew Sarett is an interesting poet , among other reasons , for his interpretation of Amerind rhythms and moods , growing out of ten years ' experience as guide and woodsman among the Indians of the North Country . Two-thirds of this volume are devoted specifically to Indian themes , and the other poems have not forgotten the spell of K'cheegamee land . The opening poem , despite its high praise by Mr. Wheelock , Carl Sandburg , and others , is not as impressive in its totality as many of the shorter things . Its nature flashes are splendid : " Beyond the peaks That tusked the sky like fangs of a coyote snarling , The full-blown mellow moon that floated up Like a liquid-silver bubble from the waters , Serenely , till she pricked her delicate film On the slender splinter of a cloud , melted , And trickled from the silver-dripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perpendicular , As startling as a thin stiff blade of ice Laid swift and sharp on fever-burning flesh ; The tremulous wail of a lonely shivering wolf , Piercing the world 's great heart like an icy sword . " At the same time , we can not see the gain in having the Christian missionaries refer to the Indians as " ye men of a bastard birth " ; it may be characteristic , but it does not ring true in the evangelical exhortation . The parts where the Indian speaks of his god " ' My frien ' , Ah-deek , you ask-urn plenty hard question : Ugh ! w'ere Keetch-ie Ma-ni-do he live ? W'ere all dose Eenzhun spirits walk and talk ? Me ? I du n no ! . . . Mebbe . .. mebbe over here , In beaver-pond , in t'rush , in gromping bullfrog ; Mebbe over dere , he 's sleeping in dose mountain . . . " These seem out of drawing . Yet this may be a limitation due to insufficient knowledge of the type . It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third of the book may be ; but the latter indubitably are not kith of poetry , and at best are interesting ethnological contributions . The other Indian poems are better . Of the miscellaneous verses , many possess a retiring sensitive beauty , reminiscent at times , that rises to poetic distinction in one poem , Let Me Flower as I Will , which is by all odds the most successful thing in the volume . The dominant impression is of a fresh soil for cultivation , a keen sense of beauty at times , but a lack of the synthesizing power to utter with finality the shaped song . This may well come ; it is much to have the new word to say . Mr. Sarett 's lack is in great measure Father O'Donnell 's merit . This slim volume , in part a reprint of his " The Dead Musician " of six years ago , contains at least half a dozen lyrics which are part of Time 's golden pack . He calls high music out of the sonnet : " Said Alan Seeger unto Rupert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Acheron 's dim waters fell With soundless motion ? ' Wherever here we look , Brother , are faces that our glances took For old familiars of that world where dwell Those that we knew before we came , through hell , Unto this peace . Familiar as a book We conned in school is that Virgilian brow , And one moves toward him with Pindaric grace . See where they meet , twin shades , and that they bow Where blind eyes star an old man 's wrinkled face . ' And Rupert Brooke to Alan Seeger said , ' These are the immortals , we are but the dead . ' " There is a breathless perfection about such songs as Transformation , Harvest Fields , The Poet 's Bread , The Cross , Requital . There is a deep religious note that knows the worshiped abstractions as breathing reality , in The Son of Man , Partus Virginis , and the exquisite quatrain The Son of God . Lacking Francis Thompson 's sweep , he is finer in small ; we prefer his chiseled gems of song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer pieces like The Dead Musician he has evoked stately music , a little thin , but ever authentic ; and there are few poets living who have sung better than Forgiveness : " Now God be thanked that roads are long and wide , And four far havens in the scattered sky ; It would be hard to meet and pass you by . And God be praised there is an end of pride , And pity only has a word to say , While memory grows dim as time grows gray . For , God His word , I gave my best to you , All that I had , the finer and the sweet , To make  --  a path for your unquiet feet . Their track is on the life they trampled through : Such evil steps to leave such hallowing . Now God be with them in their wandering . " Savage singing to silver singing  --  but always singing . To let the old hideous-sweet music of forbidden earth speak again ; to let the buried red race have its word ; to lift earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievements . CLEMENT WOOD
