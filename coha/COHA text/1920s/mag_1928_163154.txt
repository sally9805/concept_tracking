Controller Charles C. Fitzmorris of Chicago last week added up the city 's debts &; assets . <P> Chicago owed $1,045.431 . <P> Chicago possessed $13,310 . <P> Deficit : $1,032,121 . <P> Chicagoans groaned again to think they ever re-elected Mayor William Hale ( ' ' Big Bill " ) Thompson . Chicago had had no such deficit since 1917 , when the first two years of Thompsonism necessitated a special bond issue . One unprovided item was $56,700 for removing dead animals from Chicago 's streets this year . This item is traditional on city budgets , usually as a fat morsel of graft . In the case of gang-ridden Chicago , people interpreted the phrase " dead animals " as a euphemism for something far more grisly than graft . <P> Two days after Chicago 's deficit was announced , the Chicago and Cook County tax bills were issued , having been withheld by Thompson henchmen until after the primary election . When they received their tax bills , citizens all over Chicago exploded with fury , and rushed to the City Hall to protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and county taxes had been jacked up tremendously . Some citizens found their taxes raised 100% , some 200% , some 1,000% . <P> Police had to defend the bulky tax books from irate citizens who wanted to see how much their neighbors were paying . Everyone suspected discrimination , fraud . A queue of 20,000 indignants , four abreast , milled and chafed in the tax office out the door , far down the street . All taxes had to be paid by May i , to avoid penalties . Lawyers said there was no escape except through changing the law retroactively and getting refunds .
