Orange Blossoms , Drivel , Gladness <P> Nine years ago , when Pollyanna and its sequel Pollyanna Grows Up had newly burst upon the view , one reviewer , more prophetically than he knew , remarked : " Pollyanna retires from her second book at the age of 20 and she is ' glad , glad , glad for - everything , ' for she and Jimmy love each other . . . . Two other incidental romances and some mysteries still remain unsolved ; so he added apprehensively it may be necessary for more ' glad ' books to follow . " <P> Precisely this has happened . This maddeningly idyllic girl has reappeared. * <P> The Story . Pollyanna Whittier , inventor of the famed " glad game " ( which consists of picking out silver linings for all the blackest clouds ) , marries Jimmy Pendleton in Chapter One and becomes forthwith " just the entrancing , glad little bride you would expect her ( from the previous Pollyanna books** ) to be . " It rains on her wedding-day , Jimmy has n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eats up the chicken-salad she was saving for dinner , just because he happens to find it alone and unprotected in the icebox - but things of this sort are , to Pollyanna , merely added reasons for finding something to be " glad " about . Even when the War comes and Jimmy must leave for Plattsburg , does she weep ? Certainly not ! She strokes his hair , " murmurs tender comforting things , " sews his buttons on , sends him away with a smile . <P> Then she goes back to her old home in Beldingsville , Vt. , lives with her Aunt Polly . Here it was that she had arrived some years before ( in Pollyanna ) , a forlorn little orphan determined to play the " glad game .

But meanwhile she never writes Jimmy about her great " secret , " for which of course she is " gladder " than ever . <P> When James Senior comes back from the War , and is asked to pick out James Junior from a group of eight babies , he , of course , chooses the right one , inevitably , because James Junior looks up and laughs at him , " glad " , while the other seven howl in misery . <P> The Significance . When Eleanor H. Porter , author of the first two Pollyanna books , died four years ago , Pollyanna ostensibly died with her . <P> But her publishers were loath to lose such a goldmine .
