txt David Lloyd George , Liberal leader , launched an attack on the proposals contained in the Young report on reparations In ! the House of Commons this afternoon and he drew assurance from Philip Snowden . Chancellor of the Exchequer , that there will he " no further sacrifice of British interests . " Mr. Snowden reiterated that the government was in no way committed to the acceptance of the Young recommendations and promised to " do his best to see that justice was done to Great Britain . " " The British Government , " he said , " will raise no protest against the scale of the annuities , hut we can not agree to accept the proposals for delivery in kind unless we are finally compelled to do so . " In urging that Mr. Snowden use his influence and authority to " secure very substantial modifications " in the Young scheme , Mr. Lloyd George said that he . dare hardly to trust himself to say what he thought . " I read the report with amaze-1 ment , " he explained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have signed it . " His objection was that the whole sacrifices had been made practically at Britain 's expense . Seen as Disastrous . " The scheme , " he said , " is quite capable of being manipulated in a way which would be disastrous to the exports of a country like ours . It is a one-sided transaction that is weighted against us in every direction . If there has been an abatement in the German annuity , it ought to be distributed fairly between the creditors . But now ? if there was a depression in Germany we should he left out altogether .. It is not merely a setback  --  it is humiliation for Great Britain , and the government must not accept it . " Mr. Lloyd George mentioned that he had with him letters that had passed between himself and President Wilson . " I found , " he declared , " that . the American advisers took a very broad and beneficent view in regard td reparations , but when they came to debts they were exceedingly hard and unyielding . " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the American opinion or the American conscience of today . " In 1922 this country proposed to abandon every claim it had against any country in respect to debts , provided that the United States were prepared to abandon . its claim against us . It is a grave misfortune that the proposal was never carried out . " Mr .. Snowden said that there were three main points in the Young report which had a serious interest for Great Britain " Britain will accept . " he said , . " the scale of annuities . With regard to distribution , I agree with . Mr. Lloyd George 's sentiments .. In regard to deliveries in kind , the British Government will not agree . unless finally compelled to do so . to accept the proposals in the report . Distinctions Are Opposed . " We will have something to say , " added Mr. Snowden. " in the forthcoming conference upon the distinction which has been made between postponed and unconditional annuities - and the fact that we had nol share at all in the unconditional annuities . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , constituted a new demand for fresh British saerifics and he said- that " whatever the result of the - conference . I can assure you there will he no sacrifice of Britiz=h interest : . " . In his estimate 9f the sacrifice which The afrertance of the report Imposed on Britain , Mr. Snowden said it.reduced Britain 's share in the annuities " by just under $12.500.000 a year . " " We were supposed to get front the conditional annuities and debt payments , " he explained , " just enough to meet our future payments to America . It we get all that we could expect under the proposals we would just get , with interest from our European debtors , enough to pay the future annual-payments to America . There would not be a surplus for Britain . " In  --  the case of France there would be a surplus of $105.000,000 after the British debt payments were met . All the other creditor nowers , too , would have surpluses beyond their outgoing payments . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
