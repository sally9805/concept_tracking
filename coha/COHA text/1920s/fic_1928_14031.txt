From time to time there are auctions of the fittings that made up the old dime museums , and at such an auction you should be able to pick up a revolving cyclorama of the Holy Land and Egypt , which is the scenery for this piece . Turn down the gaslights , for it is night in Palestine , and introduce a lady and a child on a donkey . They are accompanied by an old man on foot . The donkey 's name is Hepzibah . HEPZIBAH ( For the tenth time ) : I 'm tired . OUR LADY I know , I know . HEPZIBAH I 'm willing to carry you as far and as fast as I can , but within reason . ST . JOSEPH If you did n't talk so much you 'd have more strength for the journey . HEPZIBAH It 's not my lungs that are tired , it 's my legs . When I talk I do n't notice how tired I am . OUR LADY Do as you think best , Hepzibah , but do keep moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Noise of ironmongery in the wings , right . ) HEPZIBAH Well , I 'm doing my best . ( Silence . The Tigris passes on the cyclorama . ) We must talk or I 'll have to halt . We talked over the Romans and the whole political situation , and I must say again that I and every thinking person can only view such a situation with alarm , with real alarm . We talked over the village , and I do n't think there 's anything more to say about that . Did I remember to tell you that Issachbar 's daughter 's engagement had been broken ? p. 3 OUR LADY Yes . HEPZIBAH Well , there 's always ideas . I hope I can say honestly that I am at home in ideas of all sorts . For instance , back in the yard I 'm the leader of a group . Among the girls . Very interesting religious discussions , I can tell you . Very helpful . ( As some more iron is heard falling in Judaea , the Euphrates passes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HEPZIBAH I always say to the girls : Girls , even in faith we are supposed to use our reason . No one is intended to swallow hook , line and sinker , as the saying is . Now take these children that Herod is killing . Why were they born , since they must die so soon ? Can anyone answer that ? Or put it another way : Why is the little boy in your arms being saved while the others must perish ? ST . JOSEPH Is it necessary to stop ? HEPZIBAH I was stopping for emphasis .  --  Mind you , it 's not that I doubt . Honest discussion does not imply doubt necessarily .  --  What was that noise ? OUR LADY I beg of you to make all the haste you can . The noise you hear is that of Herod 's soldiers . My child will be slain while you argue about Faith . I beg of you , Hepzibah , to save him while you can . HEPZIBAH I assure you I 'm doing the best I can , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean that noise , anyway ; it was a noise ahead . Of course , your child is dearer to you than others , but theologically speaking , there 's no possible reason why you should escape safely into Egypt while the others should be put to the sword , as the Authorized Version has it . When the Messiah comes these things will be made clear , but until then I intend to exercise my reasoning faculty . My theory is this p. 4 OUR LADY Hepzibah , we shall really have to beat you if you stop so often . Hepzibah , do n't you remember me ? Do n't you remember how you fell on your knees in the stable ? Do n't you remember my child ? HEPZIBAH What ? What ! Of course ! OUR LADY Yes , Hepzibah . HEPZIBAH Let me stop just a moment and look around . No , I do n't dare stop . Why did n't I recognize you before ! Really , my lady , you should have spoken more sharply to me . I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lord , what a donkey I was to be arguing about reason while my Lord was in danger . ( A pyramid flies by . ) Do you see the lights of the town yet ? That 's the Sphinx at the right , madam , yes , 3655 B.C. Well , well , it 's a queer world where the survival of the Lord is dependent up on donkeys , but so it is . Why did n't you tell me before , my lady ? ST . JOSEPH We thought you could carry us forward on your own merit . HEPZIBAH Oh , forgive me , madam ; forgive me , sir . You do n't hear any more soldiers now , I warrant you . Please do n't direct me so far  --  excuse me  --  to the right , madam . That 's the Nile , and there are crocodiles . My lady , may I ask one question now that we 're safe ? OUR LADY Yes , Hepzibah. p. 5 HEPZIBAH It 's this matter of faith and reason , madam . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might say about it OUR LADY Dear Hepzibah , perhaps some day . For the present just do as I do and bear your master on . ( More pyramids fly by ; Memnon sings ; the Nile moves dreamily past , and the inn is reached. )
