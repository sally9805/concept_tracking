T HE appointment of General Charles G. Dawes and Mr. Owen D. Young to serve as American experts on the committee which is to investigate Germany 's financial troubles is another step toward our non-political participation in the restoration of Europe , though it must be said that if the Reparation Commission had wished to find out the status of Germany it could have done so long ago . That body has been a tool of the French  --  nothing more or less ; if it is now going to proceed in a detached scientific way , we have advanced . As to the new negotiations between Germany and France , there may be some hope in them , but once more M. Poincare blocks progress by his statement that there can be no talk of a revision of the treaty and no readjustment of reparations except through the Reparation Commission . Fortunately , there are growing signs that M. Poincare is learning to change his mind . With the promise of a British Labor ministry in office before long , he does well to reconsider his positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this holiday season we have released the last of our political prisoners sent to jail under war-time federal laws . One man remains in the toils , it is true , whom the Joint Amnesty Committee included in its appeal , but the circumstances in his case put him on a different footing from that of the men who went to jail because of conscientious beliefs which they were courageous enough to declare in an era of hysteria and blindness . But while we are thankful for the vindication of American honor that has been achieved , and although we give full praise to President Coolidge for his part in it , we can not but feel a certain sadness that this act of justice has come only after some of the men have served more than five years in jail , after prisoners convicted in similar circumstances in Europe had long since been released , and after the opposition of official Washington had been worn down by a prolonged process of attrition and erosion . Neither can we forget that the fight for victims of free speech and opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political prisoners but there are 127 men in Washington , Kansas , Oklahoma , Idaho , Illinois , Pennsylvania , and California ( ninety-seven in the latter State alone ) imprisoned under absurd and unjustifiable anti-syndicalism laws . We must now voice an aggressive demand for the release of these men and  --  unless the Supreme Court declares such statutes unconstitutional  --  for the repeal of the laws as well . T HE action of the Republican National Committee in yielding to the demands of Negro voters and the exigencies of the Coolidge candidacy by restoring the unfair and unjust representation of the Southern States in the Republican National Convention get rid of this scandal on June 17 , 1920 . Its restoration now is proof positive of the alarm of the presidential machine and of the determination of the President 's backers to dominate the convention . There could be no stronger argument for the abolition of the party convention as it now exists . For there is not one single honest reason which can be advanced for the restoration of a system which has no other purpose than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delegates who represent only a handful of voters . R EVE AL I N G as to the undercurrents of the De Is Huerta conspiracy in Mexico is a tiny paragraph in the State Department 's announcement of December 11 as printed in the New York Times : " The American consul at Frontera , Tabasco , Robert L. Rankin , telegraphed the Department at 10 a.m. , December 10 , that the garrison at Frontera revolted at noon December 9 in favor of De la Huerta . The commanding officer was killed and a number of Bolsheviks were executed . " Thus a United States consul and the official machinery at Washington help propagate the assumption that any Calles.adherent is ipso facto a " Bol-shevik .
