James John Davis , second Secretary of Labor since that Department was divorced from Commerce in 1913 , celebrated his eighth year in office with a report touching all phases of the work in 1928 . Some facts : The Federal employment service found jobs for 1,412,645 applicants . The Bureau of Conciliation intervened in 478 industrial disputes . It worked to tranquillize strikes and lockouts affecting 350,000 workers ( but claimed no great success in the bitter , long-drawn coal strike of last winter , which it proved powerless to end ) . Immigration is in Labor 's province and Secretary Davis dwelt at some length on how the restrictive immigration law of 1924 had worked . Two things worried him , or two phases of the same thing . Immigrants from most countries in the Western Hemisphere escape the quota law . The law specifies that natives of Canada , Mexico , Cuba , etc. etc. shall be nonquota immigrants , and recent court decisions have permitted aliens born in quota countries to commute into the U. S. to work , in border cities like Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also the swarms of Mexicans , 80,000 or more per annum , who have been sifting into the U. S. and getting U. S. workmen 's jobs because they will work for low pay .
