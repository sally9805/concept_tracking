In Manhattan , the American League of Professional Women held a music forum luncheon last week . Two guests of honor were given the same topic : " What shall we do about jazz ? " They were Dr. John Roach Straton , fundamentalist Baptist , and Marguerite d'Alvarez , Peruvian contralto . Dr. Straton rose first , bit off his words , said loudly , severely : <P> " We ought to consign jazz to a hotter place than this earth . . . . It is bootleg music . Let us curb it ; let us put it down ; let us outlaw the thing ! . . . The jazz hound is the musical bandit , running amuck . You ca n't purify a polecat . Let us try not to reform jazz , but to stamp it out-to kill it like a rattlesnake . Good music is one of the things that charm the soul in Heaven . " <P> Drawled Mme. d'Alvarez pleasantly : " Jazz is my reason for living in New York City . I prefer to live in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music . New York is jazz incarnate . Its architecture , its business , its life-all sparkle to a syncopated measure . . . . An honest jazz tune is better than a sermon on prohibiting anything . . . . When I die I have only one request to make . I want music at my funeral , but no dirge or mournful laments . Play only one thing and let that number be George Gershwin 's ' Rhapsody in Blue . ' To me it is truly great music , and certainly it is the music that best expresses us moderns. "
