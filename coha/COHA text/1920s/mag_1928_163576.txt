' " <P> " Avoid the word ' Romanism ' when ' Catholicism ' is intended . . . . " <P> " Any non-white is ' colored . ' If an in dividual is a Negro , call him that . " <P> " When the weather department forecasts a sudden freeze , it does not follow that the fruit crop is ruined .

" <P> " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glamor and thus exciting sympathy . . . .
