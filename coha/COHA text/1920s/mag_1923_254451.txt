Has the Reader Any Rights Before the Bar of Literature ? <P> There is a new kind of literature abroad in the land , whose only obvious fault is that no one can understand if . Last year there appeared a gigantic volume entitled Ulysses , by James Joyce . To the uninitiated it appeared that Mr. Joyce had taken some half million assorted words- many such as are not ordinarily heard in reputable circles-shaken them up in a colossal hat , laid them end to end . To those in on the secret the result represented the greatest achievement of modern letters-a new idea in novels . <P> The Dial has awarded its $2,000 prize for the best poem of 1922 to an opus entitled The Waste Land , by T. S. Eliot . Burton Rascoe , of The New York Tribune , hails it as incomparably great . Edmund Wilson , Jr. , of Vanity Fair , is no less enthusiastic in praise of it . So is J. Middleton Murry , British critic . <P> Here are the last eight lines of The Waste Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling down Poi s'accose nel foco che gli affina <P> Quando fiam ceu chelidon - O swallow swallow <P> Le Prince d'Aquitaine a la tour abolie These fragments I have shored against my ruins Why then He fit you . Hieronymo 's mad againe . <P> Datta . Dayadhvam . Damyata <P> " Shantih Shantih Shantih " <P> The case for the defense , as presented by the admirers of Messrs . Eliot , Joyce , et al. , runs something like this : <P> Literature is self-expression . It is up to the reader to extract the meaning , not up to the writer to offer it . If the author writes everything that pops into his head-or that is supposed to pop into the head of a given character-that is all that should be asked . Lucidity is no part of the auctorial task . <P> It is rumored that The Waste Land was written as a hoax . Several of its supporters explain that that is immaterial , literature being concerned not with intentions but results . <P> A dozen books to have read : Ann Severn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Oxen ( Atherton ) ; The Bright Shawl ; ( Hergesheimer ) ; The Cathedral ( Walpole ) ; The Enchanted April ( Elizabeth ) ; Jurgen ( Cabell ) ; Last Poems ( Housman ) ; The Life and Letters of Walter H.
