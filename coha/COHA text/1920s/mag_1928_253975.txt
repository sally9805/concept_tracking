If President Coolidge should pack up a galaxy of green silk pajamas and 36 pairs of spats , go jaunting in the Southland , perform like a clown and be hit on the nose by a lollypop at the New Orleans Mardi Gras ( Fat Tuesday ) - he would no doubt be flayed in the press for wantonly neglecting his duty . But an unlimited amount of insouciance is expected and applauded when it is exhibited by Mayor James J. Walker of New York City . <P> Two facts make this possible : 1 ) Mayor Walker 's buffoonery is shrewdly directed ; 2 ) New York , despite its turbulent subway problem , gets along somehow no matter who is mayor or where he is. * <P> And so on Fat Tuesday , 125-pound Mayor Walker was standing on a reviewing platform in New Orleans with 300-pound Mayor Arthur O'Keefe . They were watching white-robed Negroes lead mules through the streets . The mules were attached to creaking floats filled with masked and strangely costumed debutantes , bankers , brokers and cotton kings . Behind the masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans was celebrating the pre-Lenten festival that seven roistering French students began a century ago . <P> There were a half-million people in the streets . It was fun . Hot oysters and cold bottles . " Promiscuous masking , " said the official program . It was a fine old tradition . The gentility rules the city . Their clubs-Comus ( the oldest ) , Atlanteans , Momus , Proteus , Twelfth Night , Mystics , Druids-gave balls and there was much whispering as to whether little Miss Such- &-Such; got any invitations . Then there was the Queen , chosen more for her social graces than for Atlantic City qualifications . This year she was Miss Betty Watson , daughter of Banker Eli T. Watson , last year 's Rex . The new Rex was Leon Irwin , insurance man , to whom Mayor Walker drank his only champagne toast of the trip . <P> The Zulu Rex , pride of the Negro population , tossed Mayor Walker a coconut which he caught with the words : " From one nut to another . " <P> A float @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved into view and its commander threw Mayor Walker a ten-pound box of candy , which almost bowled him over . He grinned happily and said : " Do n't throw any watermelons . " <P> Christopher Columbus passed as the Mayor cried : " There is the greatest man that ever lived . Except for him , I 'd be in Ireland now . " <P> Pocahontas poked along and the Mayor pointed " Smith she was in love with , was n't it ? Yes , Pocahontas looking for Al Smith . Good . " <P> Later , after receiving a large gold key to the city and a gold badge signifying life membership in the Louisiana Jockey Club , Mayor Walker made his farewell address : " Ladies and gentlemen of New Orleans and surrounding cities , hamlets , villages , towns and states , I was never quite so thrilled in my life . . . . " * <P> At Mobile , Ala. , Mayor Walker did not leave his train . He had canceled an engagement to speak when he heard that politicians hostile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private home instead of a theatre .
