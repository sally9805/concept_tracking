Every once in a while in the hurly burly of life , of getting things done , 1 of looking ahead , many of us who I have children need something to make us pause and realize the happiness that lies at hand . Two letters which came to me not long ago from women with growing children sound this note so passionately that even if they are a little saddening in their retrosm c. tion , they may help us to appreciate more fully our present . . Here is one letter : " Dear Mrs. Bevans : The letter in the paper of May 9 from a father of four small daughters pleased me greatly . Ile spoke of his full Sundays , of how little leisure he and his wife had one that day ; of how the children went to Sunday school and their parents to church ; how the afternoons were given up to the little people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His letter brought back to me days that are gone . We , too , were the parents of four  --  only one of our girls was a boy . We , too , went to Sunday school and church every Sunday , and our Sabbaths , too , were far from being rest days . But it paid , ' Father of Four , ' it paid richly . Our little family is grown now ; Two are married and away . And I sometimes wish that I could call back the old days when I had them all around me , for with all the care and weariness , those were happy days . " Here are parts of the other letter , leaving out the warm appreciation and good wishes that are so inspiring : " What I would have given to have had such inspiring reading when my baby was tiny as appears in our daily press ! But it 's more important with many a mother today to play bridge , go to the movies , yes , and to sluggishly sleep away a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of a maid to whom baby ? Is Just one of the many things she has to keep in mind while mother is away having a good time . " Please do not think I do not realize mother must have diversion and needs an occasional nap . But if she only senses that time soon passes , and will make the baby the ill Ina portant Individual he really is , soon she will have all the time needed ta play , rest , or what not . I know . for I had a baby who now has babies of his own , and , 0 , the comfort It is to me to thilik that during the years he needed me I was attentive to his wants , leaving him but seldom and then with mother or sister . My only regret is that I did not know all that may be known today by devoting a few minutes daily to the children 's articles so ably written In the papers .
