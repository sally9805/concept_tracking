To William Randolph Hearst , publisher extraordinary , retired politician , the Brooklyn , N. Y. , Daily Eagle ( Independent ) , popped these questions : " Whom will you support for President and what issues will determine the election ? " <P> Mr. Hearst 's own 26 newspapers had given no clear reflection of his stand because in different cities different stands are needed to please different groups of readers . Mr. Hearst used to be a Democrat . But ever since he was publicly tongue-lashed by Alfred Emanuel Smith in their celebrated quarrel of 1919 , et seq. , the G. O. P. has grown in Hearst favor . Before the nominating conventions this year , the Hearst press boomed Secretary Mellon for President and Prosperity . When Mayor Walker of New York City visited the Hearst ranch after the Democratic convention , people said he went to make overtures ; to persuade Mr. Hearst , if not actually to support Nominee Smith , at least to " lay off " him , to forget Nominee Smith 's bitter contempt for him and to bury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showing Tammany as a little yegg in a tiger-striped sweater , Mr. Hearst subsequently published nothing very damaging to the Brown Derby . <P> Mr. Hearst was in Paris when the Eagle 's questions reached him . President Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia University , prominent Republican , had just flayed the G. O. P. for its Prohibition attitude ( TIME , Aug. 27 ) . Chairman Raskob of the Democratic National Committee had just asked Nominee Hoover please to be more explicit about his Prohibition attitude . Nominee Smith had just defined his Prohibition attitude by proposing a form of the so-called Canadian Plan ( dispensation by States ) for U. S. liquor control . <P> Mr. Hearst decided the time had come for him to make a statement and so , via the Eagle , he said : <P> " . . . I doubt . . . if the Democratic party can make Prohibition the dominant issue and , furthermore , I do not believe the party could win on that issue even if it could make that issue dominant . I say this , notwithstanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America just as it has proved a failure in every other country in which it has been tried . . . . <P> " There is a popular belief that Prohibition was imposed upon the country during the War , while a majority of our voters were unable to register their disapproval . But the plain facts are that more than two-thirds of the local option districts of the United States were dry long before the war and that the dry Federal Act was but the national and natural expression of that dry local option majority . The people of these same districts are still dry and are not going to change constitution or legislation until they have lost faith in Prohibition as a remedy for the liquor evil . I believe that day will arrive , but I do not think it has arrived . " <P> Mr. Hearst then elaborated the fact , which every one knows , that the People , not the President , alone can alter the law or the Constitution . He called it " treason " for a Nominee to propose that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " . . . There is enough defiance of law by private citizens . Must we also have defiance of the Constitution by the President to please Mr. Raskob ? " <P> He flayed Dr. Butler as follows :
