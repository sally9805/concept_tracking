The uncertainty , if not the obscurity , into which sharp-witted Senator George Higgins Moses of New Hampshire was plunged directly after the Hoover nomination , persisted and persisted until last week . Senator Moses was the original Hoover-ite in the Senate . He was made permanent chairman of the Kansas City convention . He was widely discussed for the VicePresidential nomination . That was the Moses crescendo . After Senator Curtis was nominated , Senator Moses was widely predicted for Republican National Chairman . Then that title was given to Secretary of the Interior Work . Senator Moses was announced as Eastern manager for the campaign . Then Chairman Work began to function and Senator Moses was announced as just one of Dr. Work 's many subordinates . Contrary to G. O. P. tradition , there would be , said Dr. Work , no New York headquarters for the Hoover campaign . That was the Moses diminuedo . Senator Moses hastened to Washington . He was told he might be something called Director of the Service of Plan and Policy . He returned to Manhattan thinking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peer . But last week , at a Manhattan meeting of National Committeemen from the New England and Middle Atlantic States , Senator Moses found that Dr. Work still intended to control the entire campaign from headquarters at Washington ; that he and not Senator Moses would preside at Eastern advisory meetings . Senator Moses gave way to thoroughgoing irritation . " I am not a Mahomet 's coffin ! * " he cried . " I am President pro tem of the Senate . I was selected by Mr. Hoover 's friends to preside over the National Convention that nominated him . I shall go to Palo Alto to deliver the speech of notification . I see that it is useless to remain in the campaign after that . So I guess I will take the first steamer to Europe and rest ! " But the campaigners dined late that night at the Harvard Club and in the course of the evening Senator Moses was persuaded to accept a new title-Vice Chairman of the Advisory Committee . Dr. Work remained chairman of this body , ex-officio . Senator Moses ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with special reference to the seven Senate seats held by Democrats between Maryland and Maine . Resilient , Senator Moses declared that he was satisfied . " Serious differences are sometimes characteristic of strong-minded men , " he said . " I should say that just now harmony is at least a foot thick hereabouts . " And off he dashed to Dublin , N. H. , to enlist the services of Col. George Harvey , publicist-extraordinary to all Republican nominees since 1916 ( before which he helped " make " Woodrow Wilson ) . Puzzlers for the cause of so much confusion over the status of Senator Moses found it , or thought they did , in the Senator 's wetness . He is a much too forthright gentleman to have concealed his personal convictions on the Wet side . There he stands with Senators Edge of New Jersey and Reed of Pennsylvania , and National Committeeman J. Henry Roraback of Connecticut . Though long potent in G. O. P. councils , all are now most inconspicuous in the Hoover movement with the exception of Senator Moses , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Hoover is elected with Republican Dryness a dominant issue , the Moses record as a Wet might even interfere with his inheriting from Senator Curtis the leadership of the G.O .
