The Federal Trade Commission has filed a complaint against the Eastman Kodak Company , alleging conspiracy in restraint of trade , with respect to the Eastman Company 's manufacture and sale of cinematograph film in this country . According to the complaint , the company had manufactured and sold up to March , 1920 , 94 per cent of all film , and sold 96 per cent of all film , produced in the United States . Between March , 1920 , and September , 1921 , it is alleged , foreign film was so extensively imported that the sales by the Eastman Company fell to 81 per cent of sales of film in this country . <P> The claim is made that the Eastman Company , by its grip on distributors of motion picture film , compelled the delaying of deliveries to Eastman 's competitors , as well as discriminate against its competitors ' customers in the granting of credits .
