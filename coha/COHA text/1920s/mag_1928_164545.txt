Spats and squabble-across the large U-shaped table of the Council of the League of Nations kept a gavel rattling sharply , last week , as order was repeatedly commanded by Chairman Senor Aristines Aguero y Betancourt of Cuba . He , popular in Berlin , as the suave , easy-going Cuban Minister , conducted the soth League Council session at Geneva , Switzerland , with vigor , tact , address . Small Cuba sat metaphorically enthroned over the Powers due to a system of alphabetical rotation which lifts up each nation in turn to the League 's High Chai : . <P> Fourteen " Yesses . " With kinetic directness the Council moved to attack the Vilna question-unsolved for the past eight years . <P> Question : Shall the Baltic city of Vilna belong to Poland ( now holding it by authority of the Allied Council of Ambassadors ) ; or to Lithuania ( which received Vilna from Soviet Russia under a treaty signed between those states in 1920 ) ? <P> Stocky , stiff-pompadoured Prime Minister Augustine Valdemaras of Lithuania , who has so long obstructed any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned , last week , by British Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain .

Quick to relieve the tension , however , was Sir Austen Chamberlain . " I will introduce , " said he sonorously , " a motion which is clearly a matter of procedure , and hence needs only a majority , namely , that the Council put the question of Polish-Lithuanian relations on the agenda of the September session . " <P> As this face-saver was rushed through , M. Valdemaras grinned and bellowed jovially : " I 'll vote for that . Let 's make it unanimous ! " <P> Explanation .
