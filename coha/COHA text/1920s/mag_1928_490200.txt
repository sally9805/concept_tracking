WE made a pilgrimage down to the windswept tip of the island on a little matter of business . Leaving our horse tied out in front of the Standard Oil building , we visited many of our favorite haunts  --  the turtle tank in the Aquarium , the model of the Mauretania in the Cunard office , the India House , Coenties Slip , Trinity churchyard ( where we laid a wreath on the grave of Alexander Hamilton ) , Henry Bartels ' animal importing emporium on Cortlandt Street , the Stock Exchange , the municipal fire boat , and a coffee house ( for a few moments of silent aroma ) . Everything was fine , just fine . Except for one or two new buildings , nothing had changed since our last trip . in fact , as we wandered dreamily about , it occurred to us that nothing had changed materially since Peter Stuyvesant . All the persons we saw in the streets , all the busy folks in the tall buildings , were carrying on ? bargaining for wheat , disputing legacies , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just a community of earnest traders , the same as always . WINDOWINDOW dressers are a furtive W race of people , and have always reminded us of gophers . Still , there is a native decency about window dressers ; whatever their own feelings , they respect the feelings of their wax dummies . The other afternoon in Fifth Avenue , due to some style crisis which we did n't understand , it became necessary to undress a lady dummy right in broad daylight , without drawing the shade . The problem called for more than a common amount of tact , we felt , and we tarried a while to learn how the window dresser would handle it . After glancing nervously around at his audience , he solved it  --  somewhat Qsin to our surprise by blindfolding the dummy with a white handkerchief . A4ACHINAL means relating to 1 . V1 machines . We mention it for the benefit of the lady who sat on our left and spent the first episode asking her girl friend what tnachinal meant . Machinal is pronounced ma-shin ' - al , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the benefit of the lady who sat on our right and spent the second episode discussing how machinal is pronounced . Zita Johann was in bed in a hospital because , in the play , she had given birth to a child . We mention that for the benefit of the lady-behind us who wondered out loud  --  the minute she saw a hospital ward  --  whether the girl was sick . Getting one 's seat changed for a seat nearer the centre is not possible when there are no vacant seats nearer the centre . We mention that for the benefit of the young ladies in front of us who spent . the first six episodes discussing the possibility of changing to seats nearer the centre . Further , we not only mention these things for the benefit of all these atrocious people , but we will he glad to furnish a complete description of the people , together with seat numbers and date of performance , to the manager of the Plymouth Theatre or to the District Attorney . A hotbed of ignorance and feminine garrulity is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some redress for an innocent man . T IFE , which Long ago dosed in upon I-4 us from every side , now bears down upon us from above . While we sit in our little cell trying to work , an airplane circles above and a voice shouts down at us , shouts down praise of a certain brand of cigarettes . Deep in our heart we would n't have it otherwise . People arc busybodies by birthright , and if somebody gets ahead in the world by sitting in a cloud and shouting down , the earth is probably that much more interesting and merry . But , as a citizen intent on getting ahead ourself , we reserve the right to take down our old musket from the wall and fire at will on the enemy from the rooftop . This is just a warning . We might add that we know several other people who do n't care what kind of cigarettes they smoke and who have squirrel guns . We are a personal friend of the old Sixty-ninth , too . Specificat ; ons IN a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the playwright , who is casting a new show , was discussing with a lady the difficulty of filling one particular part . " I want , " he said , young man who looks like Lindbergh , who is tall , blue-eyed , who has sex appeal , a sense of humor , and an air of distinction . " " So do I , " sighed the lady . The Week 's Star KAREL KOZELUH , the Czech tennis professional , sat among the crowds at Forest Hills for several weeks without causing any excitement , but when he started to play he aroused interest at once . Tilden has said he is the best player in the world . Others , among them Lacoste , have expressed themselves to similar effect . All the famous amateurs are more or less afraid of him . Kozeltih hails from Prague , where he was born in 1896 , and in his boyhood was trained by Sokol , the famous Bohemian gymnastic society . In his teens he became one of the best soccer players in Europe . He was equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even better at tennis . He was first generally heard of in tennis circles in 1925 when he entered the Professional Tennis Championship of France . A cut under an eye , received in a football match when he was playing for Czechoslovakia against Italy , forced him to default , but he gained enough rec ( ignition to get several important matches during the year following . In 1926 he entered the professionals ' tournament again and won it with but the loss of a single set . Some few were not surprised ; they had considered him the best professional in Europe from the time he was seventeen . Watson Washburn beat him once , but outside of that he has the distinction of having beaten all the amateur stars who have consented to play him . He bested Tilden in a set in singles . For some reason the match was n't finished . He played against Tilden in doubles and his side won . Tilden 's partner was Hunter , Kozeluh 's a German of no great renown . He has won over Cochet at doubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three times to decide the professional championship of the world . The Czech NVOIlin two straight matches . Richards is responsible for his being in this country , having guaranteed him $15,000 for a series of appearances locally and a further reward for exhibition matches elsewhere in this country . SEPTEMDER Z 9 , 1 9 2 8 The Czech picked up tennis on the courts of the lVlasaryk family , one of whom later became president of Czechoslovakia . He was ball-boy for the children . When they had finished , he would take the court , barefooted , against a companion , using a wooden paddle instead of a racquet . At twelve he could afford a racquet and by the time he was fourteen he had learned to wield it so well that he was hired as an assistant professional by a club in Munich . His game has never been spectacular . He succeeds by great strength through which he wears down his opponents , and by supreme steadiness . Experts have been unable to discover any weaknesses in his play and he is the master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five brothers and a sister , and all but the sister and one brother are professional athletes . He is not impressive  --  only five feet eight in height , and slight . He plans , they say , to turn amateur . This he can do under the rules of his country by refraining from professional play for a year . He wants to force Cochet , Lacoste , and others to play him , perhaps to be able to cry at them , " Okch , okeh ! , " an ejaculation he always makes at that " Edward , who is that pretty little girl who 's waving to you ? " " Gee , Mother , how should I know ? " Having His Fun EVEN book-sellers have their fun . One of them , in a Fifty-ninth Street shop , was asked by a young man if he had a copy of a certain widely read , suppressed book . The bookman shook his head , and the other made inquiry as to where he might find a copy . The dealer shook his head again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a confidential tone finally directed the young fellow to 215 West Twenty-second Street where , he said , they have the biggest line of suppressed books in town .

Cops in wet ponchos , pushing hack the curious , sad-faced people , who want to see celebrities ; pushing back the open-faced uncomfortable people who do n't know they have been drawn there so they can be pushed back . Women in white fox and orchids thinking they are celebrities because other people are being pushed back . Women in orchids and white fox , getting nut of limousines , presenting gold tickets .

If you want glamour at so much a whack , go to any big movie opening . We held a gold ticket at the Jolson show  --  kept it for days in our vest pocket over our heart . Nights , before going to bed , we sang mammy songs to that gold ticket , cried to it , crooned to it . Then the big night came and , before going in , we stood for a moment in ? the lobby of the Winter Garden . A cop took our elbow . " You ca n't stand here , " he said . " Yes , I can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed him the gold ticket , and we went inside . We fel to our knees in worship , and were promptly trampled by thousands of important people whom we had never seen before and shall never see again . Strange things happen at audible pietin-es . Little girls whom you have known and loved for years because they kept so quiet  --  little girls like Betty Bronson , silent , pretty children  --  suddenly , after four years , open their lips in a frightened trembling moment and say : " Al ! " It shatters almost everything in life . The Singing Fool . The sad clown . The death of a little boy . Mr. Jolson , crying big Warner Brother tears at the bedside of the dying boy . Mr. Jolson ? making a curtain speech as thousands applaud , telling about how he cries real tears . Big expensive tears . Big audible tears . Twice daily . Ha ' penny IT has recently come to light that our government , notorious strainer at gnats and swallower of camels , has issued a half-cent stamp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told by the clerk who weighed them that the postage would he thirteen and a half cents . " No doubt the government will kec-p the extra half-cent , " said the lady acidly , giving him fourteen cents . " No , madam , " he replied , " here is your change . " He handed her a half-cent stamp . The new stamps were issued because the postal rate on a certain kind of printed matter was increased from one cent to one and one-half cents a pound and it appears that they have no utility whatever except when used in combination with other stamps . They bear the likeness of Nathan Hale . Black Magic FOR the confused mind , perhaps something should be said about photograms , and things like that . Photograms are pictures , or documents , sent by wire the same as telegrams . To send a document costs only one and one half times as much as a regular telegram , but pictures are quite expensive . It is all very simple . You have a new baby , say . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph of mother and child . They will send it to an aunt in Cleveland for fifteen dollars , an uncle in Chicago for twenty dollars , an old nurse in Los Angeles for forty-five dollars . As yet only eight key cities are equipped to send and receive , your photograms being relayed on to other places by airplane . Newspapers use photograms for news pictures , in cases like the Florida hurricane . Lawyers send photograms of legal documents , making error impossible . Banks do n't send cheques yet because it 's not certain whether photo-cheques are legal . The case has n't come up in court . By photographing the script , messages can now be sent in any language . When Postal first inaugurated the system , the first message to he sent was in Arabic . ( Presumably an Arabian gentleman wandered into the office and they got him before he gnt out . ) Musical scores are often sent  --  song hits of Tin Pan Alley are released in San Francisco within twelve hours . Fashions are sent from Paris . DO N'T confuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boring you ? ) is very , very different . At the Radio World 's Fair last week , which was terribly dull , we took a look at television . A man with a scrubby mustache let himself be televised . Ile showed his teeth and winked and leered , which is about as far as television has gone at present . The pictures did n't do justice even to that . His mustache was vague , and his chin finally faded out altogether . What we could see of him looked pretty grim . Nobody is using television yet and we can well understand why . The only thing to report about the newest in radio sets is that they now mostly plug into the electric-light circuit  --  no batteries . They are also disguised artfully in period furniture . Some of them have liquor cabinets . His Native Land ONE of the latest villains in Hollywood movie circles is a Lithuanian with great mustachios . When he arrived in this city on a ship from Europe an interviewer asked him some questions about Lithuania . One of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor pondered . " Pretty big , " he said finally . " We got stamps . " Andy Cohen FOR years Mr. John McGraw of the Giants believed that a Jewish player would be a big box-office attraction , but until this season he had discovered but two worthy of being given a trial  --  one named Solomon and one named Levy . Neither played swell enough to stay on the team . ' This spring one of Mr. McGraw 's representatives happened to see the name Cohen on the score card of a game played in the Texas League . The scout watched the game and concluded that the player might well be given a tryout here . This was accordingly arranged . As practically everyone knows , this Mr. Cohen has had a very successful year with the Giants , playing at second base . Although Cohen was carried off the field on the shoulders of admirers on the opening day of the season , he had a hard time during the first month or so . For the reason that he was trying to fill the shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , taunts were frequently thing at him . They would have been hurled at anyone . In one city the announcer called out to the spectators , " Cohen batting for Malone . " From a loud-voiced fan came the answering bellow , " Casey leaving the park . " Mr. Cohen concluded that it would be wise to meet these jibes merely with a smile , and he generally stuck to that decision , although once or twice he would make some retort to a particularly offensive person . One such , seated in a front box during a game in Cincinnati , kept saying sharp things to the player every time he came to the bat . Finally Cohen hit a ball against the left-field fence . " How did you like that one ? " he called out to the gentleman who had been tormenting him . " Hornsby would have hit it over , " came the response . Andy grinned at this . His agreeable disposition and his good playing won the good-will of the crowds , and of his fellow players , before mid-season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friends . He has probably received more presents this season than any other player . The booty includes fourteen wrist watches , a dozen cigarette cases  --  although he does n't smoke  --  half a dozen rings , travelling bags , shirts , ties , sweaters , and radio sets . The new player is retiring by disposition , but likes to make talks before boys ' clubs . He reads both Will Durant and Edgar Guest , and goes to most of the musical comedies . Out of season he lives with his mother in El Paso , where he once coached the football and basketball teams in the high school . He was a star athlete at the University of Alabama . His secret ambition is to go back and get his degree . The Best People THE passenger list of one of the ships which sailed out of New York for a special cruise this summer was made up largely of church folk hound for the Holy Land , but there were a few misfit souls aboard who were pretty eager to get to Monte Carlo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was smoking on deck one day when she was accosted by another lady , a Christian fellow-passenger , who asked her to cease smoking and told her that if she did n't she would go to hell . This angered the accused one , and she sought out the cruise conductor and opened up on him indignantly . She derided the anti-cigarette passengers generally and then hotly declared that she and her husband were as good as anyone on the ship . " I 'll have you know , " she said , " that we are the biggest concrete-mixing people in Ohio . " TeaWest Eighth THE passing of the Whitney Studio Club brings a good deal of grief to the four hundred young artists who were its members . It will chiefly be missed , perhaps , as the hang-out of the younger men and women who were not affiliated with the sterner organizations and found , in its airy and ample rooms at 10 West Eighth Street , a haven , philosophers , and friends . Gone will he the annual Christmas party given by Mrs. Juliana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party ending at dawn Christmas morning with a famous breakfast at which a southern brand of pancake was the piece de rjsistance . Gone , too , will be the members ' masquerade ball , held annually during the holidays . From now on the premises will house an art gallery , known as the Whitney Studio Galleries , and whatever forlorn members may hereafter gain admission as exhibitors . Glancing at the sterner side of things , it is believed that the closing of the club means no particular loss . That statement is high praise for Mrs. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney , who founded the club , and whose generosity has kept it going for fourteen years . She feels , as do all concerned , that the club accomplished its aim and that it would he dangerous to continue the organization . It answered a great need at a time when the modern artist had nowhere to hang his picture and everywhere to hang his head . Mrs. Whitney opened her studio then to give exhibition space to one of the contemned painters of the day . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable that the younger half of the club now look upon them as reactionary . Too , the hundreds that followed have found an outlet for their efforts in at least three of the prosperous galleries in town , Daniels , Dudensing , and Weyhe . Kuniyoshi , Spencer , Brook , Bouche , Potter , Billings , are some of the youngsters who graduated from the club and found satisfying fame . The secessionist group , of which the club was the centre in the old days , included Jo Davidson , Paul Manship , George Bellows , John Sloan , William Glackens , Robert Henri , Eugene Speicher , Hayley Lever , Malionti Young , Randall Davey , Paul Dougherty , Max Kuchne , William Zorach , and Blendon Campbell . Mrs. Whitney has been more happy in aiding art than many another patron . Her idea was practical help , the sale of the product . That was always the thought uppermost with the club , but it also sponsored sketch classes . These were conducted by the students themselves , as was everything else in the outfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bylaws , or resolutions . Mrs. Whitney always kept close contact with the organization , although unobtrusively . She saw every exhibit , for instance , and bought many pictures ; but she did this privately and the artist rarely knew that she was the purchaser .
