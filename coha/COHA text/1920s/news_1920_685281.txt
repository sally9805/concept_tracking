txt Fifth Avenue Traffic Criticism . To the Editor of The New York Times : The new plan of traffic regulation applied to Fifth Avenue has greatly facilitated the movement of traffic . It has , however , a serious defect , rwhich holds considerable danger for the pedestrian . For example , when the east and west bound traffic is moving , the pedestrian going north or south on the Avenue is halted at the cross streets . On the change of signal , the Avenue traffic is resumed and the east and west is stopped . pedestrian taking his cue from the white light , and seeing the east and west traffic stopped , assumes he may cross the east and west streets  --  and in safety . But as he is crossing , motor cars from the lines of the Avenue traffic , moving in either direction , are permitted to turn into the cross streets direct'ly across his path and-supposed right of way , to his great danger . From my own experience and observation , escapes by the narrowest rilargin occur daily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be . allowed to do so while the Avenue traffic is moving and the white light beckons on the Avenue pedestrian . His safety should be guarded by preventing traffic from crossing his right of way . Some solution should be found for thin menace . Such traffic might be held back until the green light shows , ' when it could readily join the east and west bound lines , at no danger to the pedestrian , since he at the moment would be halted by the signals set against him . At present there is a conflict of right of way . These conditions are , of course , equally true where the . pedestrian is moving east or west across the Avenue , with traffic from the cross streets turning into the Avenue , since the relative positions would be the Same .
