txt Secretary MELLON 'S statement regarding the trade revival and the condition of the credit market will presumably revive the lately active discussion of the Reserve Banks ' general policy . Mr. 31ELLON finds trade and industry expanding with great rapidity , but holds that thus far , at any rate , the movement has proceeded on a sound basis ; that excessive speculation has not been a dominant influence ; that the use of credit is not abnormally great . He seems to think that no precautionary move by the Federal Reserve in the way of advancing discount rates is at present called for . As against this judgment , many will lay stress on the Reserve Board 's remarks about the credit situation in the current monthly bulletin just given out at Washington . In this , while admitting that " member banks " have not been borrowing abnormally from the Federal Reserve . ' the board states that total loans and investments of private banks which have the privilege of rediscounting at the Federal Reserve had at the end of 1922 nearly reached the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question why , then , these banks have not been borrowing from the Federal Reserve , the bulletin replies that the country 's very large gold imports since 1920 went first into the private banks and by them were deposited in the Federal Reserve as a basis for their own reserve , thus rendering unnecessary the creation of such reserve by heavy rediscounting . It is possible that some readers of this bulletin may infer that the credit situation is today as precarious as it was in 1920 , and therefore that drastic action by the Federal Reserve can not safely be deferred . But the matter calls for more careful analysis . To begin with , the fact that private bank loans are nearly ** greater than a year ago and virtually as high as in November , 1920 , does not of itself prove undue credit expansion . That must in any ct/se be tested by the character of the loans and of the mercantile and industrial movement financed by them . The Reserve Board itself has pointed out that this invirvAtied demand for credit " appears ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current ? production , ? ? that " the goods pro ? duced have moved steadily into the ? channels of trade , " and that " no " large physical volume of goods has " been accumulated " with a view to " speculation in inventories . " This is precisely the reverse of the situation in 1919 and 1920 . Professor SPRAGUE of Harvard , writing on Thursday in The Evening Post , expressed belief that the present high ratio of the Reserve system 's ratio of reserve to liabilities does not settle the question of the Reserve Board 's attitude ; that this ratio is " not merely ? valueless but a positively dangerous ? guide in the determination of dis " count policies . " By this he means that if the present high reserve ratio were held to warrant increase of Reserve Bank loans and liabilities to the full measure authorized in Me Federal Reserve act 's provisions for the lawful minimum to which that reserve percentage should be allowed to fall , then outstanding credit represented by rediscounts might be doubled . The inference is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the only way in which such inflation . of credit could be effected would be through precisely such increase of rediscounts and Reserve Bank liabilities as would itself reduce the ratio of reserve . By the admission of all parties , there has been no such recourse to the Reserve system 's facilities . Even the fact of large gold importations does not imply excessive use of credit , based on the new reserve facilities thereby acquired by private banks , If it did , then the reduction of $2,000,000,000 in loans by private banks in the Federal Reserve during 1921  --  a year in which our net gold imports were $677,000 , - 000 ? would be at least anomalous . It is fully recognized that the Federal Reserve stands ready to take protective measures at the first plain eiddence of reckless inflation of credit or of undue recourse by the private banks to the Federal Reserve facilities . But for the board to take such steps before the situation had thus shaped itself , and , in particular , before the portfolio of rediscounts had itself begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . , In the last analysis , the raising of the rediscount rate achieves its end through preventing recourse , on the previous easier terms , to a Reserve Bank 's credit fund . But if the private banks have not been financing the trade movement through such recourse , how would a higher Reserve Bank rate affect their policies ?
