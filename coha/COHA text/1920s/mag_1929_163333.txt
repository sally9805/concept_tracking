An orange , lemon or grapefruit in which 800 little fruit flies are hatching soon becomes a horrible , maggoty thing . Since last May , when a U. S.

Nervous Tampa depositors , entering their banks , saw in tellers ' cages great stacks of crisp , green , reassuring bills . Soon , by rail and motor , arrived an additional $4,000,000 .
