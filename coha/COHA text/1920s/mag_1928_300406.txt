History and legend are filled with plagues , most horrific of which was the Black Death which scourged Europe in the middle of the Fifteenth Century . When Boccaccio 's characters fled Florence in 1438 and spent their exile telling the stories of the Decameron , they thus escaped a swift , nauseous blight which , so the tales run , made dark convulsions of men 's faces , twisted tortures of their bodies . <P> No such macabre romancing is possible with influenza epidemics . They are extensive , exasperating to the medical profession , sometimes desolating . But even when their death toll is enormous they make no lurid history . Influenza is too subtle a disease to lend itself to ghastly poetics . <P> In the past weeks nationwide sniffling , coughing and dull fevers have heralded the spread of influenza . Unlike the famed epidemic of 1918 , the disease spread from west to east. * Last week the U. S. Public Health Service in Washington estimated that 700,000 persons had the disease , with a possible peak of 3,000,000 cases . Kansas was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Public Health Service saw no cause for panicky fears . In 1918 about 450,000 persons died of influenza . Last week 43 out of 78 principal cities reported the comparatively small death total of 379 . Everywhere the disease was mild , not virulent . The mortality rate for influenza is low . Some specialists maintain that death never occurs unless there are complications . The Public Health Service urged sleep , food , exercise , avoidance of crowds . <P> They could do little else . The influenza bacillus has never been isolated . Hence a specific cure or preventative has yet to be developed . But the nostrum men , flourishing in a medicinal half-world , made the most of last week 's threat of epidemic . To the newspapers they went with their cleverly evasive advertisements to allure the flu-fearful . Such an advertisement was that for Japanese Oil ( EN-AR-CO ) , which under the arousing headline FLU EPIDEMIC described the oil 's use for head colds , sore throats , chest colds . Perhaps even more persuasive were advertisements for Turpo , Nozol , Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tea . <P> <P> * Pandemics ( worldwide epidemics ) generally move westward . The U. S. influenza epidemic in 1918 was part of a pandemic , supposedly having its origin in Spain .
