Sprawling like a high-humped lizard on the bed of the Atlantic Ocean is a mighty ridge , its lazy length ( about 50 degrees N. lat. to 40 degrees S. lat. ) following the S-shaped outlines of the continents on either side . A sheer 9,000 feet of height , it towers in the way of deep sea fishes scurrying from Pernambuco to Benguel . Its knobby head rises curiously above the waters in the north ( Azores plateau ) ; St. Paul , Ascension Island , and Tristan da Cunha mark its southern peaks . <P> Long before the days of scientific dredging , Plato and his friends sat at the baths discussing an ancient and powerful kingdom , an ideal commonwealth which had sunk into the sea : Atlantis . Others took up the tale ; medieval writers made much of it ; Brazilian legends still stimulate searching parties . The bank itself has been thoroughly mapped by H. M. S. Challenger ( 1873-76 ) , the German ship Gazelle ( 1874-76 ) , the French ship Travailleur ( 1880 ) , the U. S. ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Prince of Monaco , the German Validivia expedition , etc . <P> The black-painted sailing schooner Atlantis is now on the high seas headed toward this buried land . At the helm is Columbus O'Donnell Iselin 2nd , 24-year-old oceanographer , Harvard graduate and romanticist , son of the late Lewis Iselin . Last year , in his 76-foot fishing schooner The Chance , he dredged , collected specimens along the Labrador coast , as he had previously done along the Gulf Stream , Bermudas , Atlantic Coast . <P> Oceanographer Iselin knows what he wants . He wants to see , touch , examine the Globigerina ooze of the ocean bottom , the volcanic debris of the ridge top . To this end he has designed special apparatus : an enormous dredge with bulldog teeth which , lowered to the bottom will take greedy bites of the ocean floor ; three miles of cable to take it down and bring it up again . <P> The drag net for evidence of the sunken continent will be spread for the most part around the Azores , because in addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy surveying expedition brought back bathymetric maps of a submerged plateau with terraced shores in this vicinity . <P> Another object is the finding of evidence which will throw light on the theory that the Americas were once joined to Europe and Africa . Similar flora &; fauna found in widely separated areas and on intervening islands give support to the theory . The massive dredge biting its way across the ocean floor may add geologic evidence about earth changes . <P> Accompanying Oceanographer Iselin is Terence Jerome Keogh , son of Justice Martin Jerome Keogh and assistant to young Mr. Iselin in designing ship and apparatus . <P> The Chance , heroine of Oceanographer Iselin 's earlier expeditions is preparing to start next month on an " around the world cruise . " Five recent graduates of Yale will collect flora &; fauna during an 18-month trip . They are Edward Dodd Jr . ( son of the President of Dodd , Mead &; Co. ) who will write a book on his return ; Alexander Brown and G. Clymer Brooke of Ardmore , Pa. ; Thomas Marshall of Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded by Lieutenant Alexander Gray , U. S. N. , retired .
