txt Sweeping Refuse Into the Streets . One of the large chain grocery stores uses sawdust on Its floor . I just watched a clerk sweep some of this from the store door across the sidewalk into the street . It reminded me of the rubbish in front of one of our public school buildings . I called the attention of the porter to it and he said he could not help it he had swept the stuff into the street at least six times , but the wind kept blowing : t back . There used to be a law against sweeping into the street , but I do n't think any serious effort has been made to have it enforced since the days of Colonel Waring . He kept the streets clean because the police of his day enforced the laws regarding cleanliness . Now every one sweeps dirt into the street and some empty cans and pails into the gutters for the wind to blow about . If each individual , property owner or tenant . obeyed the law , how much cleaner and healthier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pollee to enforce The old law for a few days ? A. B. GILBERT . New York .
