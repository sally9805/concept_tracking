Doctors , nurses , urged the patient to eat , but Earl Carroll would only turn his head away , answer : " I ca n't , I ca n't . " In some two months his weight had dropped from 145 to 130 pounds . Propped up on his pillows , eyes closed , long wisps of hair straggling across his high forehead , he lay in what one observer called a state of " cell shock , " his mind apparently focussed on the prison sentence that lay before him . <P> His evenings , though , were brighter than his days . At about 10 p. m. his wife , Marcelle , would call , with his brother , Norman , and his sister-in-law . ( Visiting hours were theoretically from 7 to 8 , but not for the Carrolls . ) The visitors left usually about midnight , and then Room 19 would be , , quiet until , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient was awake .

While his wife protested against the " inhumanity " to the prisoner , while his brother described the removal order as coming with " brutal suddenness , " Mr. Carroll was taken to Atlanta , where an ambulance met his train at the station and took him to the prison . <P> Said Attorney General Sargent ( after reading reports of government physicians who had examined Mr. Carroll ) : " There is nothing in his condition according to the reports of the physicians , that should interfere with his removal . . . . We felt we should be perfectly considerate and we have been .
