HUNKY-Thames Williamson-Coward-McCann ( $2.50 ) . <P> Jencic , gigantic , untidy prototype of all Slav immigrants in the U. S. , lives in fat little Mrs. Posilipo 's lodging house and works in a bakery . So does handsome Teena , representing the Latins . Her lips and dress are red . Her eyes and teeth flash against the swarthy background of her skin . Jencic , in a big , slow , dumb , serf-like way , wants her . Because the girls at the bakery dared her to , she took Jencic 's hand one day and told him she liked him . When he humbly tries to follow this up , she turns on him angrily with : " I 'm not so hard up I got to walk with scarecrows like , you ! " She certainly is not " hard up . " The toss of her head , the swing of her hips as she walked away from Jencic , bespeak an alley queen who can pick and change her lovers as she chooses . <P> A few evenings later she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arcade . But this is only to excite jealousy in Louie , her latest . Dark and dapper , Louie steps up to Jencic , who just stands there like a block of wood , patient and talkative . Louie punches him on the jaw . Sitting on the sidewalk , hulking Jencic looks up with sick eyes , whispering , " Do n't hit me . " <P> Baker Krusack is Jencic 's confidant and civic tutor . He got Jencic 's citizenship papers for him at the City Hall and delivered with them this speech : " Now . . . you belong here and nobody can run over you . If anybody makes trouble for you , stand right up to him and tell him not to forget who you are . . . . The new nationalities are according to jobs . Some of these days nobody will ever say a man is a Swiss or a Slav or anything like that ; they will say he is a plumber or a baker or a machinist , and what he does for a living will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krusack hears about Louie and how Jencic is accepting defeat in love , he promises to fire Jencic if he does not lick Louie at once , and without getting drunk first . <P> When he sees Louis and Teena approach , Jencic hides in a dark doorway . Sharp-eyed Louie yanks him out by the collar . At last Jencic awakes . He grabs Louie by the throat , smashes his face . Down goes Louie , then up with a knife . Mighty Jencic just advances slowly , arms out seeking to crush , face murderous . Louie retreats . Baker Krusack commends Jencic : " You 've been a worm , but now you 've turned over , and you 'll stay turned over . . . . Well , there must be rewards for all good work . . . . I will show you another part of the trade , so you will learn it all the faster . " <P> Teena , however , offers no congratulations . " Get Louie back , " she mutters to Jencic . " Ask me anything you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got to promise to get him and see that he comes here . " <P> Jencic refuses until she weeps . Then Louie can not be found . Then the truth comes out . Louie has got her pregnant . This time Jencic proceeds against Baker Krusack 's advice . He is his own man now . He says : " I know all about Teena , more'n you do . It is true she done something she should n't do , but after we get married it will be all right . Everybody makes mistakes . What if people did n't forget such mistakes , then everybody would be mad at everybody else , and nobody would have even one friend . "
