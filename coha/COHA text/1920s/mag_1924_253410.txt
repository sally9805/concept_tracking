The Democratic Senators assisted by a Democratic Governor and Lieutenant Governor did what they could . They got two witnesses who testified that the Chairman of the Republican State Committee had instigated the placing of the ludicrous bomb . The witnesses also declared that one " Toots " Murray had actually placed the bomb . <P> An automobile was procured and seven men jumped into it . One was the chauffeur . Two were Assistant Attorneys General of Rhode Island . Two were Police Inspectors of Providence . The remaining two were the witnesses . The automobile rolled over the State line into Massachusetts . It went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Murray , who was reported to be acting as a guard to protect the Republican Senators from being kidnapped . Mr. Murray was not found , but suddenly in the dark watches of the night the Officers of the Massachusetts law descended upon the Officers of the Rhode Island law . <P> The Rhode Island men were carried off to the police station-arrested as suspicious characters . They telephoned back to the Governor of Rhode Island . He remonstrated with the Massachusetts law to release his Officers . Massachusetts declined . At 1 a. m. the seven hapless Rhode Islanders were locked in separate cells . Nor did they get out till some time later , when a local Attorney furnished bail .
