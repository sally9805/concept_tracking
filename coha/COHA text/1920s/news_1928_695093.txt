txt SEEKING THE PEACEFUL LIFE The Society of Quiet Turnstilers Issues Call for More Members . To the Editor of The New York Times : May I ask space to seek new members of " The Society of Quiet Turnstilers " ? Even to those who are weary of joining things , and have highly resolved to join nothing more , I venture this appeal . Will you not belong to The S. of Q. T. ? There are no officers , no dues , and no minutes of the previous meeting . The origin of this society goes back to a letter in a New York , paper which I read a year or more ago , from some one whose name I regret to say I have forgotten . This writer said that he , or she , had begun operating the turnstiles of subway and elevated stations without the crashing noise that nearly all passersthrough cause them to make . This suggestion seemed of little importance when I first read it , but I find now that it was both courteous and much worth while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came about in this wise : One day when I entered a subway station I had rather a severe headache , and it seemed as though every blow of the turnstiles would split my ears and what was left of my brain . Then I thought : Perhaps the man making change in the booth over there has as unpleasant a head as my own this afternoon . I can escape this horrible racket in a minute more , but he must stay here and listen to it for hours upon hours . It 's a wonder that every employe of the roads in these places does not go absolutely crazy ! Then suddenly the letter I have referred to , suggesting quiet operation of the turnstiles , occurred to me with entirely new force . Why not join even the few who have begun this considerate action ? This I have proceeded to de . The good habit , I find , strengthens with exercise . Without exaggeration , I now feel positively chagrined if I let the bar whirl around loose and make the crashing sound . Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the S. of Q. T. has the satisfaction of doing the thing less like a destroyer of ears and nerves , and more like a skillful and thoughtful unit in even a headlong crowd of the rush hour . By resting one hand on the wooden bar immediately in front of the body as one passes through , and thereby easing the stile from smashing violently against its next stopping place , a quiet operation can with very little trouble be achieved . It does not take an entire second 's extra time , and delays nobody . It confers a touch upon one 's neighbors ' sensibilities ( and one 's own as well ) like a contact of velvet when he was expecting the impact of a harsh hammer blow . I am hopeful that we members of the society shall be able before many more rush hours actually to change the present barbaric , devastating and utterly unnecessary uproar of the turnstiles into considerate and neighborly approach to peace . Those of us who already practice the simple rule of the fellowship are going to listen with eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the thousands . To catch the magic quiet wrought by the many who courteously keep a hand on the turnstile bar and prevent its crashing will be " the thrill of a lifetime . " Why not let us all enjoy the pleasure and mutual satisfaction of so simple yet desirable a social amenity ? ELIOT WHITE . New York City , May 30 , 1928 . THE MUSIC STUDENT .

Former Mayor Disputes Statement in Review of Hearst Biography . To the Editor of 7 he New York Times ! May I avail myself of your columns to correct a statement made by your reviewer , Charles Willis Thompson , in his article on John K. Winkler 's biography of William Randolph Hearst in THE TIMZE Book Review of May 27 ? Commenting on my nomination for the Mayoralty in 1917 , Mr. Thompson says : " In 1917 , or five years before Smith ' removed Hearst as an appreciable factor in national politics . ' as Mr. Winkler puts it , he had Murphy so cowed that he asked Hearst to name the next Mayor . ? ? ? Hearst indolently turned the matter over to his secretary , one L. J. O'Reilly , and apparently dismissed it to plunge into more important ones . O'Reilly recommended a certain unknown Brooklynite named John F. Hylan , and Hearst forwarded the name to Murphy , who obediently made that lucky obscurity Mayor for eight years of the proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdity on Mr. Thompson 's part to ask your , readers to believe that a Mayor of this colossal city , with its tens of millions of dollars of annual . budget and its six millions of population , can be nominated on the passing fancy of a secretary of a newspaper publisher . It is also an insult to Mr. Hearst 's keen political sense to imagine that he would lend the weight of his . name and organization to an " unknown Brooklynite . " This sort of thing may sound good in a movie plot , but factually it is absolutely without foundation . The facts in the matter are as follows : Early in 1917 a city-wide organization composed of the business leaders of New York , known as the Business Men 's League , enthusiastically endorsed me for the Mayoralty . Later in the year the Committee of 170 , a group of Democrats , Republicans and Independents , also espoused my cause and named me for Mayor . I might mention at this point that this committee and its action was approved by Mr. Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearst were carrying on an independent campaign to have him nominated by petition . Learning of my endorse . ments , Mr. Hearst withdrew from the campaign and announced that he , too , favored my candidacy . How much of an " obscurity " I may have been at the time of my nomination may be judged from the fact that in 1914 I ran for County Judge on the Democratic ticket in Brooklyn ( a notoriously shaky borough for the Democratic Party ) and I beat my opponents by a plurality of more than 38,000 votes . Moreover , I led the entire Democratic ticket ( which included the late popular Judge Roy ) by 8,000 votes . If this is obscurity , then I do not know the meaning of the word popularity  --  nor does Mr. Thompson . Mr. Winkler , as a good newspaper man , might have done well to have " checked up on his facts . " I would have been happy to accommodate him . As it is , this passage ( in an otherwise excellent book ) is loosely written and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneer . I have always been proud of Mr. Hearst 's support , and when he came to my aid in 1924 I am happy to relate that he said , " I am a sincere friend of Mayor Hylan because I like him and because I greatly admire his sterling character , his genuine ability , his incorruptible honesty and his uncompromising devotion to the service of the public ? ? ? he maintained the five-cent fare in spite of the efforts of Tammany and Governor Smith and all the powerful financial interests of the city to make him permit the breaking of the Interborough contract and allow the traction companies to charge a ten-cent fare . " JOHN F. HYLAN . New York , May 29 , 1928 . Relief for Britons . T'o the Editor of The New York Times ; In view of the amount of unemployment in New York City and the surrounding district , a meeting was held of the representatives of various British societies at the Canadian Club of New York recently , when an organization under the title of the British Commonwealth United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian Club as Chairman . The new organization will work closely with the many admirable societies at present established for the care and assistance of those out of employment , and in addition will do its utmost to obtain for the unemployed suitable work . I heartily commend the work of the organization to my fellow countrymen and countrywomen , and ask them to give material assistance to it , especially urgent in connection with ex-service men , many of whom still suffer physically from the effects of the war . The office of the organization is at 513 Third Avenue . H. G. ARMSTRONG , H. M. 's Consul General . New York , May 30. ? 1928 . Appreciation of News From China . To theEditor of The New York Times : You may recall that over a year ago I wrote you criticizing the China correspondence of Frederick Moore , and lamenting the departure of Thomas F. Millard from your service . It is only fair , therefore , that I should with equal candor commend the dispatches of Hallett Abend and Henry F. Misselwitz . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from day to day In a most praiseworthy fashion , and the enterprise the former showed recently in getting down to Tsingtao and into ' Fabian , and arranging to have some of his dispatches sent from Dairen to escape censorship , Was firstrate . Tito TimeS , in having two such correspondents in China , and in devoting so much space these days to the news from the other side of the Pacific , deserves the thanks of every one interested in China . L. C. GOODRICH . Columbia University , New York , May 2a , 1928 . The North Carolina Result . To the Editor of The New York Times : The precinct meetings recently held in this State are rather a novelty . The Smith forces did not participate in them to any great extent and for that reason the result is rather misleading . When the State Convention is held , you will find that ' the story will be entirely different . In this State there is a very strong sentiment for Governor Smith , and this accounts in large measure for the intense activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indicated by the recent precinct meetings . the unfair press stories and the unseemly propaganda which has been put out . NORBORNE G. SMITH . Goldsboro , N. C. , May 29 , 1928 . COMPETITIONS IN MUSIC . One Wonders How Much Art Will Benefit From Those Under Way . To the Editor of The New York T ? ncs : The talking machine company that has offered big prizes for a symphony and for a smaller composition chastely described as " within the playing scope of the American dance , jazz or popular concert orchestra " ought to he encouraged by your editorial note of today . Ti-is Times 's absolution of it from " any selfish desire to exploit American genius for the commercial purpose of selling more records " also should gratify it . Yet some may wonder how the absolution follows from the fact that the prize is devoted to " the recognition of the highest of all musical forms , " namely , the symphony . For all the talking machine companies sell symphonic records awl intend and expect to increase their sales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $25,003 prize would no doubt go a long way toward recouping the public-spirited and deeply musical corporation . Nor should that other talking-machine company be forgotten which nut long ago offered a prize to whoever should " finish " Schubert 's Unfinished Symphony . The offer was revised , as a consequence of an ensuing controversy , to a more rational form , but a prize is still awaiting the composer who will present a suitable symphony . Some will wonder how far " art is bound to be the gainer " from " this new corporation policy . " Has any great or even very good composition ever emerged from a prize competition ? Mascagni 's " Cavalleria Rusticana " gained a prize , and , as in the last thirty-five years or so it has had very many performances and gained a great fortune for its composer and publisher , it must be great music . It woulc be hard to think of another such success . No one of the " great " composers of the world ever achieved anything of the sort . Those whose memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's untranslatable gibe about prize compositions : " Je preiser die Composition , je du ? cher Milt sic . " All true Americans , of course , will hope for the best from native composers , and will be ready to buy the records both of the symphony properly honoring Schubert on the hundredth anniversary of his death and the other symphony which the rival company , in an admirable and commendable spirit of emulation but without the fortunate help of an anniversary , hopes to evoke by the magic of $25,000 . SYLVANUS URBAN . New York , May 30 , 1928 , LEFT WING DEMOCRATS . Policy of Defeatism Is Seen in the Simmons Position . To the Editor of The Ncw York Times : Perhaps it is from force of the habit contracted from a series or compromise candidates interrupted only by Woodrow Wilson 's success that there has come into the mental processes of many Democrats a peculiarly interesting psychology . Defeatism is not a new philosophy among the party , since it was the only possible outcome of the sickly support of these candidates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its persistence . It is such a negative quality that it is the f t usually to succumb to a new impulse , to one at all vigorous . Senator Simmons is the latest to promulgate anew this masochistic doctrine . His clarion call to the South to " defeat Smith at Houston " and his really quite stirring speech in the Senate show with what vigor he intends to perpetuate this once necessary mentality . He is a venerable man , so the papers say , with many years of politics behind him . Many of the later of these years he has had to ally himself with weak figureheads of a concededly lost campaign . This distressing business has become to him the desired ; he can not dissociate himself from party failure . It is , one imagines , more difficult for an old man to capitulate than for a young man , and that is sufficiently difficult to appreciate . But that he and his disciples should carry their ideas to such an extreme ! It is so inefficient to go to all the bother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why do they not say definitely that they will use their strength to boost Hoover ? But then that would be positive action , not at all in accord with the quite classic melancholy of the defeatist . JAY REILLY . New York , May 30 , 1928 . A Cause of Park Litter . To time Editor of The New York Times : I note In TI10 TIMES a letter from Robert H. Sexton in reference to the eystem of keeping parks and streets free from litter as adopted by the City of Vienna . As a frequent visitor to many European cities , can not refrain from cot  --  tnenting on the notoriously filthy conditions in our streets and parks as compared to any of the capitals of Europe , where cleanliness and clt le pride would preclude such conditions as exist here . Mr. Sexton has suggested the simple method adopted by the Viennese . Might 1 supplement this by an additional suggestion that would have results , especially with reference to Central Park ? At the park entrance , Fifth AN cnue end Sixtieth Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park . Neel ' It Clean . ' Evidently the Park Commissioner in mi humorist , and this warning is one of his Jokes . For no good reason , concessionaires selling drinks , gum , candles , peanuts , till scattered throughout the park . They do a thriving business , especially on Sundays and holidays , for which no doubt the city receives a slight revenue . But note the effect of this the day after . Everything sold by them Is contained either in a box , paper or skin , which tho buyer invariably throws on the walk or grass , and on any Monday morning the numerous cleaners have their hands end bags full removing this mess . As a problem in simple arithmetic it must cost the city considerably more to remove tills litter than is received from these hucksters , not to mention the fact that they mar the beauty of one of the finest parks in the world . As a lover of this great city and a nativeborn New Yorker I earnestly urge that these hucksters be abolished from Centre . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , May Os 10:8.
