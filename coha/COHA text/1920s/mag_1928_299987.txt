Many a toxophilite gathered last week at the Westchester-Biltmore Country Club , Rye , N. Y. , saw arrows shot into the air , but knew they landed and where , for the occasion was the championship tournament of the National Archery Association . Better than his fellow archers at toxophily was W. H. Palmer of Wayne Pa. , whose points gave him the championship . Dr. E. K. Roberts of Ventura , Calif. , was second ; A. W. Lambert , of the St. Louis Listerine clan was third . For the first time in national tournament history , six golds were made at 40 yards . A gold is the innermost circle of the target , counts nine points in scoring . The target consists of a central disc , 9.6 inches in diameter , four concentric rings each 4.8 inches wide , painted respectively from within out , gold , nine points ; red , seven ; blue , five ; black , three ; white , one point . Dr. Roberts made six golds . <P> The non-archer who stood by , listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cry he-he means no silly giggle : it is the traditional cry of one archer to another in the distance . To the listener a pair is two ; not so to the archer , for in toxophily three is a pair . To nock is to fit the string into the notch at the arrow 's end . To fletch is to feather an arrow . In Queen Elizabeth 's time ( 1533-1603 ) archery flourished , waned . Not until 1781 and the organization of the Royal Toxophilites Society , was there a revival .
