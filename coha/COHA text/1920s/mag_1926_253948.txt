He has the income on at least four billions . . . . George F. Baker is a billionaire , probably also Mr. Andrew W. Mellon . At least the properties they own are actually worth more than a billion . However , all that interests the average American . . . is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest the amount safely , then live wisely and usefully .
