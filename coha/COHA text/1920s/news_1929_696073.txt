txt The present high level of the price of copper , which is 24 cents a pound , against an average of 141/2 cents ovt.r the last few years , has caused much discussion in public utility circles as to the effect which it may have on new construction of power plants and transmission and distribution systems this year . In several cases leading hydroelectric systems are turning to aluminum and alloys as a substitute for copper . An outstanding instance of the substitution of aluminum for copper has occurred in the case of the New England Power Association for its transmission system at Fifteen Miles Falls on the Connecticut River . The 220 kilovolt lines which will radiate from this power site will use 795,000 circular mills aluminum a. c. s. r. transmission lines , comprising fifty-four aluminum and seven steel strands , provided by the Aluminum Company of America . The over-all diameter of these cables , built to carry the highest potential load in use in the United States at present , will not differ much from that of copper cable . Copper transmission cables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that fundamentally more metal is required for aluminum lines , but the differences in weight , tensile strength and price make aluminum a valuable and practical substitute , according to engineers . Executives of other systems are expected to study closely the performance of the new aluminum lines when they are in operation . Utilities Chief Consumers . The public utilities of the United States , together with manufacturers of electrical appliances and other large users of copper , are listed as The net consumption of copper by the electric light and power industry is in excess of 100,000 tons annually . The metal is used in transmission lines , distributing systems and wiring installations . An increase of 10 cents a pound in the cost of electrolytic copper before fabrication over the average price for the past five years means a rise of something over 12 cents a pound in the price of finished wire , or an added expense in the construction of new facilities of at least $25,000,000 annually . Applied to farm electrification , this means an added cost of $40 to $67 for electrifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an average of three farms to the mile , the total copper wire used is in the neighborhood of 1,000 pounds a mile for light service and 1,650 pounds a mile for heavier service . At present prices , this means an average increase of $120 a mile , or $40 a farm , for light service , and of more than $200 a mile , or $67 a farm , for heavier uses . Regarding the telephone and telegraph industry , the increase in the cost of copper means about $20,000 , - 000 added to the construction budgets of the year , and to the electrical manufacturers it means nearly $50 , - 000,000 . It means another $25,000,000 to the automobile industry , while window screens , cartridges and other articles of current or frequent use will all cost more to produce this year . Stocks Sufficient for Present . In copper circles it is pointed out that many of the larger users of copper have ample stocks covering their requirements for some time , especially as relates to the telephone and telegraph business , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacement of I used stocks will mean added costs for any new construction . Because of the extensive construction programs planned by the communications interests , it is said that there is bound to be an increase in their expenditures as a result of highpriced copper . While copper has attained 241/2 cents in some few instances for spot delivery , the price remained at 24 cents all last week , delivered Connecticut , while the March average for New York electrolytic , f. o. b. refinery , was 21.257 cents , according to Thee Engineering and . Mining Journal . There has been some range between prices paid by large users who manufacture their own apparatus and those paid by utility companies which buy manufactured material of all sorts from fabricators , but on the whole , the computations of the National Electric Light Association are representative of an approximate in crease of $100,000,000 in the cost of copper to the public utility industry this year .
