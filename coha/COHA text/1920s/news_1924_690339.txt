txt Ex-Senator PHELAN of California , who is to place Mr. in nomination , has already placed his candidacy in further jeopardy . On Saturday Mr. PHELAN made the mistake of discussing the large fees which Mr. received after resigning as Secretary of the Treasury . The exSenator has been abroad for some time and so may be excused for not having at once got in touch with the tactics in this matter of the chief promoters . Their policy is to say nothing about it . Their tacit view is that- the worst has been made known , that the public has been familiar with ft for some months , and that if all hands keep silent the thing may be forgotten . But Senator PHELAN boldly answered the question put to him and said that he did not see " anything in this that affects " Mr. 's honor or character in " the least degree . " He proceeded to explain that the ex-Secretary was entitled to capitalize his reputation and experience . " These being what they were , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is to be feared that Senator PHELAN 's absence in Europe prevented him from closely attending to the record . When Mr. Dormer testified before the Senate committee , he was perfectly frank about the reason which led him to give to Mr. a large retainer , and to offer him a contingent fee of *1,000,000 . There was no pretense that Mr. was engaged on account of exceptional legal ability . ' He bad , in fact , given no proof of that . Mr. Donzwr sought his services simply on account of his supposed political influence , because he bad been a member of the Cabinet , and was understood to be powerful with the Democratic President whose son-in-law he was . Mr. DoiaErrr made no bones about admitting that when the Democratic Administration went out of power his interest in Mr. distinctly cooled . ' The whole truth about the contingent fee of $1,000,000 ' has not yet been brought out . Apparently it depended upon something which President WILSON was asked , or might have been asked , to do in the imbroglio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he refused to do . At all events , after he left the White House no more was heard of the big contingent fee . The supporters of Mr. ought not to be left with any illusion regarding the exact charge which they will have to meet . It is not that Mr. earned large sums as a lawyer . It is not that , like others of his profession , he did not hesitate to capitalize his ability . The real question is if he did not under. : take to capitalize something else ? if he did not seek to coin money out of I the position which he had attained in the public service . Americans are easY-going , and do not always insist upon the finest moral distinctions in political life . But they do draw the line somewhere . They know that there are some things  --  such as political influence , the trust of the people , the confidence of one 's associates , knowledge gained by holding high office  --  which no man must be permitted to capitalize for the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
