Approximately 2,000,000 people left farming life for the cities in 1922 , according to a report made by the Department of Agriculture based on a survey of 10,000 representative farm groups . <P> The estimate , which included not nerely workers , but men , women , and children living on farms , showed a decrease of 1.5% from the 1920 census which placed the agricultural population at 31,359,000 . <P> The movement from farm to city was offset , however , by two compensating factors . One was the shift of about 880,000 persons from the towns to the land , and the other was the excess of births over deaths on farms , which reduced the net loss of the farming population to 460,000.
