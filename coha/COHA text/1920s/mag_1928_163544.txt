Major Gorden Reel , former New York State Highway Commissioner and an officer in the Air Service Reserve , last week told the New York Exchange Club a tale of the air . Told he : <P> " A certain instructor , irritated at the cautious progress and boasting manner of his flying pupil , decided to test the old swimming hole belief . They took off on an instruction flight in a machine with dual controls , one for the instructor and the other for the student . <P> " After they had been up a while , the instructor unhooked his control stick , showed it to the student , and threw it overboard with a great flourish and a malicious grin . <P> " The student , apparently hastening to assent to what seemed to be an implied order , unhooked his control stick , hurled it over , and grinned back . <P> " The instructor 's imprecations were lost in the roar of the motor , but he lost no time in adjusting his belt and parachute . He climbed out and dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student pulled out from under his suit a duplicate control stick , which his fellow-students had advised him to take on his trip . He adjusted it carefully and came slowly down to earth , circling about the descending instructor with his right thumb pressed against his nose and his four fingers extended upward and outward , and with the smile still shining on his face .
