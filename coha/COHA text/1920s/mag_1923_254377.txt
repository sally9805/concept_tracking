St. Loe Strachey , editor of The Spectator , points out that the Ruhr is becoming a second Alsace-Lorraine and reminds his countrymen that " one Alsace-Lorraine cost us one million dead . " The New Statesman , another British weekly , energetically recommends " action " to the Government . It goes on to agree with the policy of leaving the Army on the Rhine , and while deploring Mr. Lloyd George 's foreign policy , it says " he was the fully authorized spokesman of Great Britain , and we can not repudiate responsibility for what he did . We must stay in Cologne . It is at least a pied a terre from which we can exercise pressure which could not be exercised from London . " <P> " Wait and Hope " is the new slogan of the Government . Mr. Bonar Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but seems to take to his election cry of " I hardly know where I stand . " His cabinet is divided on this issue . <P> Underneath this turmoil of criticism lies grave concern at the clouded future of British commercial interests .
