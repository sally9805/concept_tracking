The art of Mary Garden and her service to French opera in the U.S. are commonly accounted " great . " Yet when the Chicago Civic Opera Company stopped on its tour last week in the cow-town of Amarillo , Tex. , and when Mary Garden sang her famed impersonation of Thais , Editor Gene Howe of the local Globe-News , cow-towner but no kow-tower , summed up his criticism with : " Mary Garden is so old that she actually tottered . " Amarillo 's music lovers were incensed . They apologized to Diva Garden and talked about boycotting Editor Howe . She dismissed it all as " so silly-only tell him that when he 's tottering I 'll still be singing . " <P> Editor Gene Howe , son of oldtime Editor Ed Howe of the Atchison , Kan. , Globe , is the young man who obtained national publicity last year by accusing Col. Lindbergh of being " swell headed " when he passed over Amarillo without stopping ( TIME , June 11 ) .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
