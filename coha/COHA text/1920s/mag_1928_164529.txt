Congress Thanked <P> Sirs : <P> I wish to call your attention to quite a gross misstatement of facts , wherein you state , in article on first page of your magazine of May 28 , under the caption of " Signed &; Consigned " that the members of the Legislature , now in session , had defeated a resolution of thanks to the U. S. Congress . <P> I attach herewith copy of resolution which was unanimously adopted by the Louisiana Senate and concurred in by the House of Representatives , and a copy sent to the President of the United States and members of Congress . <P> <P> SAM G. DUPRE <P> Secretary of Senate Baton Rouge , La . <P> <P> No Political Prisoners <P> Sirs : <P> In your issue of May 28 in an article on the death of Wilham D. Haywood , you refer to the I. W. W. men convicted of violating war laws and say that most of them are still in Leavenworth prison . We are glad to state that every one of them has long since been released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now any federal political or industrial prisoners . . . . <P> <P> ROGER N. BALDWIN <P> American Civil Liberties Union , New York , N. Y. <P> <P> Blown Up <P> Sirs : <P> In your issue of May 28 , col. 1 , p. 12 , you say , " Steunenberg was the target for the miners ' rage ; in 1906 he was the target for a bullet that killed him . " The facts are that a bomb was placed at the gate opening into the lawn of the Governor 's home in Caldwell . When the Governor opened the gate he was literally blown up . Harry Orchard confessed to having placed the bomb and was sentenced to prison for life . <P> This correction is not of very great importance but is mailed in the interest of the accuracy of which you are justly proud . <P> <P> WILLIAM F. VANCE Harvey , ILL . <P> <P> Erratum <P> Sirs : <P> In a recent edition you printed an article on General Wrangel of the White Army . On account of the particular interest which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that article : <P> " His misfortune was made complete when Fate snatched from him his wife . . . lost when the Yacht Lucullus sank in collision with the British Steamer Adria off Constantinople harbor . " <P> I am led to inquire the source of your information because I have had a charming woman whom I supposed to be the Baroness Wrangel , General Wrangel 's wife , in my house twice during the past four years and have received letters from her during that time . I am of course much interested to know whether not only myself but many , many others have been imposed upon by a poseur or whether there is some explanation , which I think must be the case . She has told us the complete story , the retreat of the White Army , the escape from the Crimea , the hiding of her jewels in her young child 's rag doll , of the sinking of the Lucullus , which she said she was not aboard at the time , of General Wrangel 's efforts and hers to hold together the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanitaria for those affected with tuberculosis . <P> If she is not the genuine Baroness Wrangel she is a wonder . Incidentally she has collected considerable sums of money from various cities in the United States for the support of her tuberculosis camps .
