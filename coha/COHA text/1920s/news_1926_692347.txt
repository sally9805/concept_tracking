txt PUTTING FRUIT TO SLEEP . This morning you publish a cabled report from London that Professor Thompson has discovered how to " put fruit to sleep " so that it may be preserved as in its natural state . No doubt this is heralded as a discovery wholly new and surprising to the professor , but the simple process is well known to all farmers and has been used by them in their crude way from time immemorial . Turnips , sweet potatoes , potatoes and other products of the farm are preserved perfectly by covering them with earth hilled up over them in a dry location . Apples may be kept this way , but they soon absorb an earthy flavor , and may be kept just as well in a cool , dry cellar where the temperature is that fixed by nature , usually between 35 and 40 degrees . All other fruits and nuts and firm vegetables may be preserved in this way . If left in their natural environment or transferred to similar environment elsewhere they remain sound and full of life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they awaken and not only produce new plant life . but also provide immediate nourishment for the young plants they produce . There is nothing new in the process first provided by nature and used by farmers in many ways to carry over seeds fo plant the following Spring and also to provide food during the Winter . If Professor Thompson and associates successfully apply this simple process to transportation of fruits and vegetables , they will achieve a great commercial benefit to all parties interested . J. A.
