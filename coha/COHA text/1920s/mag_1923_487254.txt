M Y predecessor in the pastorate at Seattle thirty-five years ago , a typical Titan of the frontier , was never weary of demonstrating that the Puget Sound country is not the Northwest corner of the United States . Seattle , he insisted , is considerably nearer New York City on the east than to the farthest extension of Alaska on the west . Washington State is the doorway , and the only doorway to more than one-sixth of the total continental area of the United States . One can hardly say of Alaska now what might have been said truthfully thirty-five years ago , it has n't been scratched yet . It has been scratched , and with wonderful results . What those results have been in Alaska and in the world at large does not concern us here . What they were for the State of Washington would take many paragraphs to tell . It is enough to say that Washington 's hour of greatest advance followed hard upon the golden dawn of Alaska 's Klondike discovery . It was but a dawn , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alaska has yet to come , and that day must mean more to Washington than any flurry of such ephemeral prosperity as a gold rush brings . The doorway to Alaska , and to all the coast of North America which lies between Puget Sound and Alaska , that is the State of Washington . What is of more consequence to Washington 's future is that Puget Sound is the doorway to Asia as well . Asia , indeed , confronts our whole West Coast . But it is characteristic of the land mass on both sides of the Pacific that the shores approach each other toward the north , and recede rapidly from each other on * Reproduction forbidden .

This , with the shorter arc of earth curvature as one goes northward brings the ports on Puget Sound several days ' sailing nearer those of China and Japan than are the ports of California . The volume of commerce which passes now from Puget Sound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our harbors which lie farther south combined . It was Theodore Roosevelt who said , with dramatic conciseness : " The Mediterranean Era died with the discovery of America ; the Atlantic Era has reached the height of its development ; the Pacific Era , destined to be the greatest , is just at its dawn . " One need not agree with the negative phases of this epitome of world history to appreciate the promise of the Pacific . And Puget Sound is the most remarkable of its inland seas . In area and contour , accessibility and security at all seasons of the year , scenic variety and beauty , in the healthfulness and invigorating quality of its climate , and the wealth of sea food to be found in it and adjacent to it Puget Sound will bear comparison with any inland sea on the earth . It is no idle dream that its shores will some day be the dwelling-place of many millions of people . The State of Washington might claim much of promise from the world carriers of tomorrow if it had no wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , present and prospective , there is no lack . Consider what we may call primeval wealth , that which was there before man ever saw the land , the treasure of the great woods and the treasure of the great waters . There is no need to conjecture what only yesterday were those primitive conditions , nor to waste tears on man 's extravagant misuse of the resources he found . Sickening as is the desolation of the forests where immediate profit has dominated the white man 's devastation of them , the area of Washington State still exhibits a wealth Of standing timber which can not be stated in terms easily grasped . Half the timber of the United States today is on the slopes of the Cascades , the Coast Range , and the Olympics of Oregon and Washington , the Bitterroots and Rockies of Idaho , Montana , and Wyoming . Washington itself is exceeded only by Oregon in its share of this vast bounty of nature , and today leads all other States in lumber production . Five and a half billion board feet of lumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps and eight hundred sawmills . Four hundred thousand houses a year in the United States have but a few months previous been standing timber in Washington . Fishing in the Pacific Northwest is an industry with an output of eighty-five million dollars a year . The business exceeds that of the east coast of the British Islands and New England combined . Washington handles not only her own great product , but the vast volume of fish which comes down from the north . This wealth of wood and water , which man did nothing to create until very recently and which he has most miserably failed to conserve , would in and of itself give Washington a considerable place in the commerce of the world . But there is the potential wealth of the State to be considered , in particular the magic " white coal , " which is to transform the earth , is transforming it today . One thinks of Niagara naturally with the mention of hydro-electric power . The potential capacity of the Niagara Basin is said to be six million horse-power . The Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority of Eastern experts the potential hydro-electric power of the Columbia River Basin , which lies largely within Washington , is twenty-one million horse-power . And besides this primeval and potential endowment lavished on the land there is what we may call the provisional wealth , the grains , live stock , and fruits - upon which man has so learned to depend . You may travel for hundreds of miles within the State far from the haunts of the salmon , throughout what is fittingly known as The Inland Empire , where the all but treeless land is an ocean of billowy grain at harvest time . Even the eye accustomed to the vast wheat fields of the Mississippi Valley marvels at the illimitable vista of soft-hued grain . The dairying interests are especially favored over large areas of the State by a rainfall that does not fail them in summer . Poultry raising prospers peculiarly in that climate and is carried on with a scientific efficiency and success second to that of no other portion of the land . Washington is the greatest apple-raising section of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made for fish , and under right economic conditions could produce fruit enough to feed a continent . A healthful climate is everywhere recognized today as a prime factor in the building up of a country 's population . So also we are beginning to understand the value of scenic beauty . Let another free from the habitant 's bias speak of what Washington offers the seeker after health and natural loveliness . In " The Conquest of Consumption , " Dr. Woods Hutchinson writes : When once we cross the summit of the Cascades we enter , a totally different climate , an air which is mild , gentle , and moist , but never depressing ; a country of green mountains , dazzling snow-tipped peak 's , of grass , of moss and fern , which knows neither the barrenness of winter nor the brownness of summer , a land which has all the best and most invigorating qualities of the cradle of our Teutonic race , with none of its extremes . From one end to the other it is the land of tall trees and tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prune , and the pine ; the land of the green valley and the rushing river . The rosy pink of its orchards every spring is equaled only by the sunset glow upon its peaks of eternal snow . It is the charmed land of the American continent , where a temperate sun , a mild climate , and a fertile soil give man the stimulus of the green and rain-swept North , with the luxurious returns for moderate effort of the teeming tropics . . . . If you have never seen Oregon , Washington , or British Columbia in summer , you lack important qualifications for imagining what the climate of heaven may be like . That world traveler and generous commentator on America , the late Viscount Bryce , has written : Neither Europe nor Asia nor South America has a prospect in which sea and woods and snow mountains are so united in a landscape as in the view from Puget Sound of the great peaks that rise like white towers above the dark green forests of the Cascades . If these testimonies seem to stress unduly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loveliness to praise in other sections of the State . For mingled grandeur and beauty I have seen nothing on the Pacific Coast which surpasses the view one gets under favorable conditions in going up the canyon of the Columbia River , from the fords fifty miles below Wenatchee to the hills and gorges north of that city . The somber severity of the lower canyon , with its bald , massive cliffs all but bare of vegetation , is in striking contrast with the wealth of apple orchards and vine-clad hillsides where the valley broadens at the confluence of the Wenatchee with the greater Columbia . The mountains are there also , towering to greater heights by far , with their sharply silhouetted crests melting into the sunset skies till lost in a golden haze where cloud and crest are indistinguishable . And there are other sections and scenes a plenty of which one might write with no less enthusiasm . Yet with all this Washington State is neither truly prosperous nor contented . In common with all the agricultural States Washington is hard hit at present by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington little that her grain yield is so generous when the price for grain is so inadequate . She fares better perhaps with her live-stock and subsidiary interests , but the same general condition prevails . Her precedence as the foremost apple-producing section of the world is but a mockery to the men who ship great cargoes of the finest fruit to the market , only to find themselves actually out of pocket when the freight charges are paid . Her very plenty is her poverty when that plenty lies rotting upon the ground because it is the day of the profiteer and the parasite in America just now instead of the day of the producer . Likewise the very magnitude of her potential wealth , her undeveloped water-power , makes for her difficulty in realizing upon it . If it were less , the private corporation might be sufficient for it , or the State itself might assume the burden of bringing the water to the magic wheels . But so vast is the undertaking that we shall have learned a much larger measure of cooperation than anything we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's history shows an unusual degree of devotion to the cooperative ideal . Her experiments have been many on this line , and the spirit of solidarity has wrought to more effect there in the Northwest than most of the people can either believe or understand . The things which have been reckoned her calamity ' and disgrace are really large with promise . But meanwhile there are vast areas of desolation where there should be enjoyment and fruitfulness because in common with all America Washington waits for the practical values of brotherhood among the masses of mankind to make themselves understood . Within half a dozen years Washington State has seen two massacres in connection with her lumber industry . Amid the eternal grandeur of the snow-clad giants the spruces stand , tall , cool , and silent . But the tension of the fevered pigmies at their feet is ever at the fighting-point . Seven men were shot to death on a beautiful Sunday morning in November , 1916 , when a company of two hundred and fifty I.W.W. went from Seattle to Everett to the help of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible that the fatalities were more , some bodies being swept overboard from the ship Verona in the terrible fusillade which was directed against it by those who had said that the workers should not land . Many others were sorely wounded . High-handed measures had been used against the workers for months , and barbarities endured by them which were provocative to the last degree . The men who represented property there and who were responsible for the unlawful interference with the right of the workers and their comrades to land were not officially molested for the part they had in the massacre . On the other hand the workers , who had suffered by far the heavier mortality and the more serious injuries , were swept wholesale into jail and every effort was made to hold them there for life , or hang them as the aggressors in the affair . The trial , carried on at length in Seattle with the financial backing of the lumber interests against the accused , resulted in the complete acquittal of the workers . In Centralia on Armistice Day in 1919 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if the heavier loss on this occasion fell upon the champions of law and order they made the balance more than even in the unspeakate barbarity of their vengeance following . This time a- conviction was secured of part of the workers placed under arrest , the arrests being again altogether from the ranks of the workers . The judge who tried the case had already made public oration against the workers . The evidence to prove prior conspiracy upon the part of the accusers he ruled out of court . Soldiers surrounded the courtroom and paraded their uniforms before the jurors . Intimidation was there to the fullest possible measure short of open violence or formal demand for a verdict of guilty on the part of an armed force . Nevertheless only a part of those under trial were condemned , the verdict , second-degree murder , being absurdly inconsistent with the circumstances of the massacre if the accused or their comrades were the aggressors . Even this compromise verdict was accompanied by an appeal from the jury to the judge for clemency , and since that time no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affidavit that the verdict was not according to the evidence but was wrung from the jury through fear . Add to this that an extra-legal jury composed of representative labor men sent there by conservative labor bodies unanimously acquitted all the accused in their verdict . Four years later the men who are serving terms at Walla Walla , their requests for a new trial refused without show of reason or right , may think themselves forgotten , but their fate is a constant fertilizer of the ever-thickening growth of labor solidarity . One need not resort to labor pamphlets to discover what the deeper rootage of this labor solidarity is . Here is a passage from an eminently respectable and conservative journal of California , Sunset magazine , under date of February , 1917 : Shingle-weaving is not a trade , it is a battle . For ten hours a day the sawyer faces two teethed steel disks whirling around two hundred times a minute . To the one on the left he feeds the heavy blocks of cedar , reaching over with his left hand to remove the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour the shingle-weaver 's hands and arms , plain , unarmored flesh and blood , are staked against the screeching steel that cares not what it severs . Hour after hour the steel sings its crescendo note as it bites into the wood , the sawdust thickens , the wet sponge under the sawyer 's nose fills with fine particles . if " cedar asthma , " the shingle-weaver 's occupational disease , does not get him , the steel will . Sooner or later he reaches over a little too far , the whirling blade tosses drops of deep red into-the air , a finger , a hand , or part of an arm comes sliding down the slick chute . To this vivid presentation of the price at which the lumber profits in Washington have been made should be added at least mention of the revolting , body- and soul-destroying conditions which prevailed in the lumber camps till the I.W.W. forced some decency there . Out of such travail was born the militant solidarity of the shingle-weavers ' union and later the compact and effective resistance of the Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . that surprising coordination of the working forces of Seattle which produced what is - still known as the Seattle Revolution . A " revolution " in the sense of intending any bodily harm to anybody it was not . The actual conduct of it was as orderly as a Quaker Quarterly Meeting . It was revolutionary only in the sense that it revealed to a startled public , including the workers themselves , the unrealized dependence of a modern community upon the least and poorest of the workers , and showed what the economic power of the workers means once they move and act with a common purpose . The origin of the Seattle general strike at the beginning of 1919 , otherwise described as the Seattle Revolution , was simple enough . Workers ' solidarity had been necessary during the period of the war , had been profitable to the employers , and had been encouraged by them . Consequently the labor unions grew extraordinarily in numbers and power . Then came the cessation of hostilities , the beginnings of " retrenchment " with the " deflation " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red tape at Washington , D. C. , which it is claimed stalled successful settlement of the matter in Seattle , and then the walkout of the workers of the city in common protest . The like of it had never happened in America before , and is not likely to happen again soon . It was as when the son of an overbearing father learns for the first time that he can throw his father , and fears to use his new-found power until he is ready to go his own way . Seattle labor was not ready to cut loose from the capitalist organization of society , had not dreamed of it , and had not the remotest thought of challenging the State . It has no such dream today . Spirit there is in Washington labor , and unity beyond that which is common . The Northwest has been made by men who have had to stand up to nature , and therefore are not afraid to stand up to each other . More dirt has been moved in the making of Seattle itself than anywhere else on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to resist there . But resistance is not revolution . The workers of Seattle were overwhelmed with confusion at their own success , but made an orderly retreat back to their jobs . It was the supreme opportunity of the owning and governing classes in America if they had possessed either the intelligence or public spirit to meet it . As it was they made a god of one of the cheapest demagogues who has ever disgraced the mayoralty of a great city , a man who had fawned and cringed to the workers until the logic of their own success compelled them to draw back and he could rush in and make great ado about the suppressing of a revolution which had never been . But the weakness and the disgrace of it , as the hurt of it , was more theirs , the responsible leaders of business and culture in Seattle , that they could avail themselves of such paltry subterfuge and display . If there is any possibility of understanding between labor and capital it was theirs then , and they might have done the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the press and on the platform , and a vengeance upon a foe which had voluntarily dispersed scared of its own strength , such vengeance as reacted quickly to the undoing of their own interests and particularly to the punishment of the small business man . The emphatic quality of Washington State is its adaptability to the purposes of creative labor . The climate is a worker 's , not an idler 's climate . The land is no parasite 's paradise ; it is a treasure house that waits upon free , untrammeled labor to bring forth its resources . " The summer playground of the American continent " it may deserve to be . But its summer is short , and its merits are not of the few weeks only in which men rest and play , but rather of the whole working year . The dawn of a tomorrow is upon the woods and the waters , the fruit-fields and the grain-fields of Washington , a tomorrow which can only come to the great commonwealth of the Northwest with that better social order in which the workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
