Both under 40 , they had been in the Army during the War . Suddenly they looked up to see four men , all armed , coming across the field to the house . . . .

Prohibition officer for Pottawatomie county , veteran chaser of ' leggers among the Osage Indians , headed the procession that marched upon the Harris farm . With him were three " friends , " not regular agents but deputized for this raid . They fingered their gun triggers menacingly . Farmer Harris , mistaking them for bandits , lifted his shotgun down from behind the stove , prepared to defend his home . One of the unofficial raiders was snooping under a chicken coop for a still when he caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his revolver . Harris dropped . Lowery started to run .
