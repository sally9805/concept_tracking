txt The correspondence between David Lloyd George and Eamon do Valera was published in Dublin today . In high Sinn rein quarters the opinion was expressed that unless something unforeseen happens there will be a breakdown in the negotiations , which it had been hoped would bring peace to Ireland , and that in such a contingency the truce now existing would terminate and renewed warfare would speedily follow . The Dail Eireann cabinet already has drawn up its reply to Mr. Lloyd George 's last letter to Mr. de Valera . This will be submitted to the Dail Eireann Tuesday . It is reported that it will constitute a restatement of He Valera 's previous demand for the complete separation of Ireland from the empire . The text of the documents differ widely from what the public had been misled by the forecasts of the terms to expect . It had generally been supposed from He Valera 's willingness to submit the government 's proposals to his cabinet , that he was ready for a compromise . His letter , however , is considered as a restatement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of self determination and a complete denial of any claim on the part of Ulster , to a separate bargain with Great Britain . The nearest approach De Valera makes to any acceptance to'any place within the British empire is the suggestion that Ireland might be willing to ? join the British commonwealth group , but would only make this concession in order to secure Ulster 's allegiance .
