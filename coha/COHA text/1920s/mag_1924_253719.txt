He Receives Irate Letters <P> The Editor of The Atlantic Monthly is one of the hardest-working and most modest of editors . He has brought a staid Boston publication to a circulation almost unbelievably large for that type of magazine. * Under his eye " The Atlantic Monthly Press " was born and is starting to flourish . The Living Age , now published from his offices , prospers . The Independent , in which he has no actual ownership , under a new group of owners and editors has moved to Massachusetts and is now making its home in the Atlantic offices under Mr. Sedgwick 's benignant glances . He is one of our greatest American editors , yet I believe the public knows little about him , and that is his desire . He believes that a magazine itself should speak for the personality of the Editor , and that the personality of the Editor should not be imposed on the magazine . The Atlantic Monthly carries no such slogan as " Edited by Ellery Sedgwick . " <P> In his offices in Boston-colonial offices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a country gentleman , perhaps , receiving a caller in his study . I suppose many people think of him as a decided conservative , and of his publication as of the same shade of opinion . Not so . You have only to talk to Bostonians nourished in the elder tradition to find that they actually consider The Atlantic Monthly radical . Liberal , it assuredly is , and tuned to the latest thought ; more liberal politically and culturally than it is in regard to literature . Yet it has often published matter of a startlingly controversial nature , and I fancy that its quiet Editor is not really happy unless his desk is flooded with irate letters from objecting subscribers . That is a sign of real life to him . <P> The opinions which back the issues of his magazine are not formed lightly . I once knew of his traveling miles and spending very nearly a month in order to visit a section of the country about which he was to publish a series of articles , and he insisted on being convinced for himself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Ellery Sedgwick was born in New York City , of a family distinguished for its origins as well as its accomplishments . He was educated at Harvard . He was for a time a teacher at Groton School , then turned to editorial and publishing pursuits , and served on various magazines and publishing houses . The Atlantic is interesting because of its Editor 's keen interest in present-day affairs , and his unwillingness to be fitted into any groove of opinion . After all , that is the first characteristic , I believe , of a successful editor . <P> J. F. <P> <P> *The circulation of The Atlantic Monthly is 117,352.
