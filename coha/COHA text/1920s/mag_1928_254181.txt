As everyone knows , U. S. steel makers may not combine to control the domestic market . They may combine , however , under the provisions of the Export Trade act ( Webb-Pomerene law ) , to undersell foreign mills in foreign markets . Last week , the two principal producers , U. S. Steel Corp . and Bethlehem Steel Corp. , controlling over 75% of the American export trade , proposed through their export subsidiaries* the formation of an association to market all U. S. iron and steel products abroad . <P> Surprised , financial writers recalled that the experiment had been tried before and had failed . Eight years ago , independent companies formed the Consolidated Steel corporation to handle foreign orders . American exports promptly declined . The corporation disbanded . But the alert writers also noted that the mighty U. S. Steel Corp . had not joined that earlier combine , is now uniting with other steel makers for the first time in its history . <P> Officials proving uncommunicative , it was permissible to conjecture as to the motive behind the unexpected move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered , has made a startling recovery since the War , has approached pre-War production levels . Pig iron production , which fell from 1,374,400 tonsf in 1913 to 404,700 in 1923 , rallied to about 1,100,000 in 1927 . Ingots and castings production in the same years dropped from 1,445,700 to 517,000 , recovered to more than 1,300,000 . Exports fell to 110,000 , + rose in March , 1928 , to 412,100 . <P> Steel makers , led by Eugene Gifford Grace , president of Bethlehem , have seen in this recovery a potential threat to U. S. industry . By consolidation , they may hope to eliminate costs of maintaining separate foreign offices , prevent competitive price-cutting for European business . . . . <P> Creation of a European film cartel to battle the U. S. invasion , long held a possibility , last week became a reality . Herr Klitsch , director-general of the famed UFA , is the organizer of the cartel , which includes the Institute Nazionale Luce of Rome and , possibly , French producers . <P> <P> * U. S.
