It is highly probable that , should the Senate authorize the President to continue negotiations with the signatories to the World Court protocol , a formula , if earnestly sought , might easily be found which would be satisfactory to the Senate as a modification of its objectionable reservations . The attitude of determined opposition to the entry of the United States into the League of Nations which has been maintained by the Republican Party since the election of 1920 is a direct violation of what many voters considered as pledges which Mr. Harding made , or allowed to be made on his behalf by the famous " thirty-one eminent Republicans , " as well as by others , to the effect that the election of Mr. Harding was the surest way to secure such entry .
