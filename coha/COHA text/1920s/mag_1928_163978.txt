While echoes of Governor General Stimson 's inaugural speech still rang in the Philippine press , a short , swart , bald , bearded little man in Washington put finishing touches on a speech of his own , sent it to the U. S. House of Representatives , caused his trunks to be packed and , with his wife , started for home . Governor General Stimson had declared flatly his opposition to Philippine independence in anything like the near future ( TIME , March 12 ) . The little man in Washington , Resident Commissioner Isauro Gabaldon of the Philippines , was resigning and going home , not only to keep independence sentiment alive but to fan it up afresh as never before . <P> Richest native of the islands , an able lawyer ( trained in Spain ) , politically independent of such professional agitators as Manuel Quezon , Sergio Osmena and Manuel Roxas , Lawyer Gabaldon intended to play a lone hand as George Washington of the Philippines . He planned , first of all , to see to it that his successor in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor General Stimson . To effect this , he dated his resignation ahead to July 16 , when the insular Senate will be in session . Secondly , he planned to enter the Filipino legislature on a straight Independence ticket . Thirdly , he said he would establish a newspaper to fight , slug for slug , the Stimson policy of introducing U. S. capital to the islands in a large way . <P> It is customary for retiring Commissioners to address the U. S. House of Representatives . But Lawyer Gabaldon had so many harsh things to say that he thought it best simply to print his farewell in the Congressional Record because , as he said to the invisible Representatives in his introduction : " Personally , I love you one and all . . . I do not blame you individually , gentlemen of the House . . . I only wish that our fate were in your hands . . . . " <P> The target of Lawyer Gabaldon 's attack , which historians called the most bellicose formal pronouncement ever made by a Filipino Commissioner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was " Powerful forces that you do not see . . . enormous sums of American capital . " <P> " Every additional dollar of American investment there is an additional nail in the coffin of our independence , " he wrote . " . . . What frightens me as a Filipino is the knowledge that those American ' captains of industry ' who have millions invested in the Philippines are also heavy contributors to the campaign chest of the Republican Party . In the name of God , Members of the American Congress , I beseech you to give us our independence before the Philippines , like the ' Teapot Dome ' and the naval oil lands , are donated to campaign contributors whose mouths are watering for our golden natural resources .
