txt With 10,746 holders of its common Oseres and 5,924 holders of first preferred shares on January 1 , the report of the American Founders Corp . for the year ended November 30 , 1928 , will receive more widespread attention than have the reports for any of the preceding years . Less than three years ago American Founders had fewer then 2.500 common shareholders , so the number has been more than quadrupled since that time . Conversion of the American Founders Trust last fall . into a corporation of similar title was probably an important step toward popularizing the shares , since in many parts of the country investors found it a difficult proposition to grasp the significance of a Massachusetts trust whereas corporate organization was a familiar matter . Coupled with the greatly increased interest in investment trust operations , adoption of the corporate form by American Founders may result in considerable expansion of the shareholders ' list in the future . Gross earnings of the company last year at ** were $2,049,75S or 72el. ? greater than the preceding year : they also represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 30 , 1926 . This was a natural result of the following out of the company s policy in making investments as well as the expansion of its resources At the close of last year total assets on the basis of securities at cost were 844.114,1972 compared with 825.180.184 in 1927 and $15,530 983 in 1926 Income Source Not Segregated In reporting its earnings . American Founders does not follow the policy adopted by some of segregating its income between that from dividends , interest and similar sources and from profits on Investments sold . Some indication of the way income divides may be gathered from the statement in the report that " income , exclusive of profits on sale of investments , was in excess of expenses , taxes and preferred share dividends . " Expenses , taxes and first and second preferred dividends aggregated last year 52.167.392 or 44 ' , of total earnings In addition the company appropriated for preferred dividend reserve $26G.130 which , added to the foregoing amount . would have constituted almost exactly 50 ' , of income . Obviously the company is obtaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sources than profits on investments sold , which is a much greater pro , portion than shown by many investment companies In connection with speculation as to amount of Income derived from sale of investments is the statement in the report that " of the considerable increase in the value of investments during the year a comparativelj small amount was realized and taken into cash income As a matter of conservative policy the directors have retained the major part of the investments for further appreciation " Holdings of Affiliated Companj Shares As carried on its books , investments of American Founders as of November 30 were valued at 83S224.875 , These included its holdings of junior equities of new investment companies , that is , companies to which it supplies investment service . These included 480 404 Class B common shares of International Securities Corp 500 000 Class B common shares of Second International Securities Corp 169.200 Class B common shares of ' United States &; British International and 300.515 Class B common shares of American &; General Securities Corp These junior securities originally were carried at cost in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British and American &; General shares are still carried , 153.33 a share for the former and $2 for the latter . International Securities B common . however , is now carried at $20 a share and Sec and International B common at $14 a share compared with bid prices currently in the market of and 21. respectively . V. S. &; British B shares ate quoted 18 bid and American &; General B 13 bid Taking all its investments at market value as of November 30. there is a total of $54,154 26G in securities in the company s portfolio Of this amount roundly $33 - 000.000 or 60 ? , was in the four groups of B shares of associated companies . In the balance sheet compiled from the c ompa.ny 's books where investments are carried at cost , with exception of International and Second International B shares , which are written tip as pointed out but carried at less than market value . the total value attached to these four groups of shares is 815 200 133 , compared with 818.698.270 for the investments in the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is these latter . however , which are furnishing the ' income in dividends and interest , as only one of the associated company B shares is on a dividend basis . If it be assumed that total income . outside of profits taken on securities sold , amounted to $2,200,000 , and deducting 8417,648 for investment service fees , there would remain $1,782,352 for interest . dividends and " other income . " allowing 882.352 for other income would leave $1,700,000 for interest and dividends or slightly more than 9- , on the $1 &?; 698.270 investments in the general portfolio . If dividend and interest income covered preferred dividend reserve it would work out at 101e , , on the general portfolio . The special balance sheet prepared for shareholders , showing investments at market value , makes total resources on that basis as of November 30 $60,043.588 , increasing the surplus and reserves from the S16,646,000 as shown on the books to $32,575,865 . This gives an asset value for each of the 1,595.932 shares outstanding on that date , $27 07 . A year previous the shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a net increase during the year of $12.18 a share . Of this increase $9.11 , less taxes and preferred dividend reserves , would have been available through liquidation of the compan ? , ' s investments , while $3.07 was in the nature of capital surplus resulting from sale of new shares during the year . Decline in Expenses In its organization American Founders Corp . has n staff of approx4nately 200 , undoubtedly far beyond the numbers engaged in directing and operating any other investment company in the country . Expenses were $776 , - 465 or 15.9,1- of cash earnings ; in 1927 these expenses were ** or 17 2el- of earnings and in 1926 expenses constituted 25.6 ' : , of earnings . - ? Investment service to the affiliated investment corn , panics formed the bulk of these yearly expenses ; thus last lyear return for that service was $417,648 , which was probably fairly well balanced by the cost of furnishing the service With exception of International Securities , where , the service fee is based on earnings , compensation is calculated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American Founders for its service enlarges and ratio of expenses should decline . Of the functions performed by the company , in addi Lion to handling its own investments , its ownership o. junior issues of affiliated companies so far has been the most profitable , exceeding returns from management and from its part in distributing securities . In fact it seems likely to continue most important since successful conduct of investments of the other companies increases directly the value of the ownership of their B shares . Of the investments in the general portfolio the largest portion was invested in continental Europe , 29.11 ? : l ; central Europe , including Germany . adcoubted for ** the investments on the continent . Largest investment in any one country was in the United States . wih 1914ee of the total , which does not include interest in affiliated companies .
