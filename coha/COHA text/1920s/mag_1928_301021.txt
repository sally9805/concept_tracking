Guarded deeply in a Paris cellar is a long platinum bar . When its temperature is that of melting ice ( 0 Centigrade , 32 Fahrenheit ) two marks on that bar are exactly one metre apart . That Paris metre is the modulus of the world 's weights and measures. * If the standard bar were lost , and all its master duplicates in the capitals of civilized countries , scientists would be hard put to recalculate the metre distance , except . . . . <P> That exception is the fact that Professor Albert Abraham Michelson of the University of Chicago has very accurately calculated the speed of light . It travels 186,000 miles a second . That figure , Professor Michelson said at Washington last week , was not more than one mile from exactness . And now scientists knowing that , he proudly repeated , can at any time they please remake the Paris standard metre . <P> Professor Michelson 's presence at Washington last week was a joy to him . The Optical Society of America was meeting there , in the auditorium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been searching out light 's properties and effects hailed him as one of their greatest . He had measured light data upon which Albert Einstein was able to base his relativity theory . <P> Silence came upon the auditorium crowd . Dr. Herbert Eugene Ives , physicist for the Bell Telephone Laboratories and one of the inventors of television , nervously approached Professor Michelson and in a timid-seeming voice presented him with the Optical Society 's Frederick Ives Medal . Dr. Ives gave the Society money for the biennial presentation of the medal in memory of his father , the late Frederick Eugene Ives , inventor of photoengraving . <P> The presentation done , Dr. Ives explained to the physicists present a new camera invented by Dr. Clarence Whitney Kanolt of the U. S. Bureau of Mines . It makes pictures seem lifelike . In front of the photographic plate is a glass grating of alternate vertical light and dark lines . In photographing , the camera so moves before the subject that its centre is always on a line with the centre of the camera lens and plate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the person or thing from one angle , others from other angles . When a second glass grating is placed over the picture it makes the proper groups of stripes seem a solid photograph . The pictures are called parallax panoramograms . <P> Another interesting machine described at the meeting was the recording spectrophotometer devised by Professor Arthur Cobb Hardy of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and General Electric 's research staff . In the machine is a glass prism which breaks up the light reflected from any colored object into its spectroscopic lines . A chart of those lines is photographed and the picture may be sent by wire or wireless anywhere . Useful can this device be for recording the exact tints of textiles , oils , soap , cheese , lard , flour , butter , chocolate , glass , automobiles , tile , brick , roofing material , carpets , rope , hardware , paper , leather , cement , linoleum , cosmetics .
