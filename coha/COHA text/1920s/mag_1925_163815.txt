In M. Briand 's luggage , as he departed from London after signing the Locarno Treaties ( see INTERNATIONAL ) , nestled a silver loving cup , the gift of Sir Austen Chamberlain . Engraved upon it were the words , A mon ami , Aristide Briand . Souvenir de Locarno . With a sigh , M. Briand quitted the scene of his greatest triumph ; rushed home to Paris where his newly formed Government ( TIME , Dec. 7 ) has none too many friends . Within a few short hours he was engaged in fighting what he himself described as the most desperate battle of his political career . <P> During the absence of the Premier , the Minister of Finance , M. Louis Loucheur , had drawn up a stop-gap financial bill the provisions of which could be justified only by the undoubted fiscal emergency with which France is faced . Of all Frenchmen , M. Briand alone was thought to possess sufficient prestige to jam this bill through the Chamber and Senate . Its provisions : 1 ) The immediate issue of 7 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the depleted Treasury , and 1 billions to supply the needs of commerce . <P> 2 ) The Bank to be reimbursed for the Government 's 6 billion francs by March 15 , 1926 , through increased taxation as follows : <P> 3 ) A fine of 10% on all taxation due this year and not paid by Dec. 31 . <P> 4 ) A retroactive increase in the taxes for 1925 , payable not later than Jan. 1 , 1926 . The increase ranges from 20% on the income tax to 100% on the products of mines ; with a 50% increase on all real estate , industrial and commercial profits , revenues from securities and trans- fers of such properties . <P> In addition a whole series of taxes " on all forms of wealth " is shortly to be proposed by M. Loucheur , to feed a sinking-fund for wiping out the internal debt . <P> Such was the appalling measure which M. Briand , called for the eighth time to be Premier of France , deemed inescapable . The last Herriot Cabinet and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to make the Chamber stomach less bitter pills than that now offered it . All France gave ear , and crowds of fashionable Parisians swarmed in the gallery of the Chamber as M. Briand mounted the tribune . <P> He cleared his throat . A wag cried , " Now for the ' cello soloist ! " referring to the Premier 's deep and resonant voice . Gravely , as though burdened by the import of his words , M. Briand spoke : " Never has a government under my leadership found itself facing such redoubtable circumstances . . . . The Chamber has in its hands the destiny of the Nation . ... To demand such inflation and such taxation as is now necessary is to put a great responsibility upon you . . . . But I honor my countrymen in thinking that they will thank you , their representatives , if you save the country in this perilous hornby voting the national sacrifices which I now demand . . . . " <P> Article by article the bill was debated , while M. Loucheur , always at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 14 hours , in his high pitched rather squeaky voice . <P> Ever M. Briand remained with-in call . When the crux of the bill , the 7 billion franc inflation clause , was about to be put to vote and trembled on the brink of failure , he ascended the tribune again .
