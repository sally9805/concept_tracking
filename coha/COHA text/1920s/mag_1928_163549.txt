As important to internal medicine as insulin , declared doctors at Northwestern University medical school last week , is the intestinal secretion just discovered by Professor Andrew Conway Ivy and his physiology research associates there . Ingested fats and meats , plus the gastric juices , make the intestines secrete a something which causes a normal gall bladder to contract and thus empty its contents into the intestinal tract where they are needed to help the body properly assimilate its food . If the gall bladder-a bulbous sack 3 in. long by 1 in. to 1 in. in diameter connected with the liver , spleen &; pancreas-does not empty its own secretions , not only is food absorption distorted , but gallstones and jaundice are apt to result . By having such secretion available as medicine for their patients ( the Northwestern men last week continued their efforts to obtain it in pure &; therapeutic form ) , doctors will be enabled to help impaired gall bladders function healthfully.                    @
