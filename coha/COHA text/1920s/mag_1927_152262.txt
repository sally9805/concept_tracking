Got 38,000 <P> Sirs : <P> Charter subscriber . First complaint . You refer to Wayne B. Wheeler as " high salaried . " Was n't . Got $8,000 a year . All he 'd take . <P> Even magazine article checks , he indorsed over to " the League . " Honest-frugal-sincere . Damned good scout . <P> K. G. MERRILL <P> Chicago , Ill . <P> Stand corrected. - ED . <P> Bereft <P> Sirs : <P> All portions of TIME are profitable . The illustration on the back cover of TIME , Sept. 26 is particularly pleasing . The artist has wittingly caught the true feminine pose appropriate to the incident . <P> I would suggest that any husband in such circumstances could employ with wrath-averting dignity the self-effacing answer Bassanio made to Portia 's magnificent devotion of herself : " Madam , you have bereft me of all words .

" <P> <P> Brat &; Kiddy <P> Sirs : <P> In a recent issue TIME , Sept. 5 you referred to " children , insultingly called kiddies " and were commended in the LETTERS column of TIME , Sept. 19 . In this same issue Sept. 19 you inconsistently described a baby parade made up of " small-appearing brats . " Which is preferable ? I do not refer to my children in either way , but if someone should inquire about my " brats , " I should consider it much more insulting to my children and me than for them to be referred to as " kiddies . " <P> Children are colloquially and good-humoredly called " kids , " not from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their unquenchable instinct to play and frolic ; just as the eagle is accepted as an American emblem , not because of the fact that it is a bird of prey , but rather because of its admirable characteristics , such as strength , size , and keenness of vision . <P> " Brat , " as a name for a child , is openly and admittedly insulting in the present day . Webster terms it " now usually contemptuous . " <P> <P> FAYTHE S. NUNEMAKER <P> ( Mrs. J.
