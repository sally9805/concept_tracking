Some big , shaggy Tian Shan ibexes , shaggier Tian Shan sheep , still shaggier Asiatic bears , some Siberian roe ( small deer ) , some Tahr gazelles , some goitered gazelles , and some 600 small birds and mammals , all dead and on the pack ponies of two lively brothers Roosevelt , entered the ancient city of Kashgar ( eastern Turkestan ) last week . " Fine success , " cable those sons of a great hunter , Theodore Jr . and Kermit Roosevelt . They had come back to their base from the rugged Tian Shan mountains after losing ponies , breath and weight in the arduous passes . Their ornithologist and curator , George K. Cherrie , was to proceed at once with their heavy bag back to civilization , via Russian Turkestan and the Caspian Sea , collecting as he went . They , the hunters , with a small , light-geared party would dash once more into the Pamir Mountains to the northward , whither they had started last month but turned back when they found that the special object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the fabulous ovis poli ( Marco Polo sheep ) , was shedding his summer coat and in no fit condition to be shot and brought home to the Field Museum ( Chicago ) . <P> Meantime , wondering what fates were befalling their husbands , the great hunter 's daughters-in-law , Mrs. Theodore Jr . and Mrs. Kermit Roosevelt , distributed their eight children among three grandmothers , and set sail for Europe , whence by ship , rail and motor and with a special guide they will follow their husbands ' trail into Kashmir . There , a happy rendezvous ; then perhaps a joint hunt for museum specimens of the long-haired tiger .
