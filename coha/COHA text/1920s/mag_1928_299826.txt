Erect , kinetic and unservile , the great Feldmarschall August von Mackensen arrived , last week , at that nest of sycophants , the chateau of Wilhelm II in Doorn . <P> Before long Host Hohenzollern inquired of Guest Mackensen what evidences he had recently observed that the German people are eager for restoration of their Kaiser and Crown Prince . <P> At Doorn this stock question is still supposed to be answered unctuously and favorably . But August von Mackensen , the hard , the merciless , the man who whipped Rumania down upon bloody knees , answered Host Hohenzollern thus : " There is not the slightest evidence that the people desire Your Majesty 's return . " <P> Without a word , but flushing furiously , Wilhelm II turned and left the room . Returning an instant later , he cried : " You have shown lack of proper respect appearing before me not in uniform ! " <P> " That is forbidden by Dutch law , Sire , " snapped Merciless Mackensen . " What I told you of the sentiments of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . " <P> Two further incidents were reported to have thrown onetime All Highest Wilhelm into " paroxysms of rage " last week . <P> For one thing the notorious Russian gigolo , Alexander Dvorjanin Zoubkov , who married Wilhelm 's eccentric sister , Princess Victoria zu Schaumburg-Lippe ( TIME , Sept. 28 ) , sent to the Chateau at Doom a copy of his outrageous and scurrilous memoirs , inscribed : <P> To Wilhelm The Genius of Our Family <P> From Alex Your Affectionate Brother-in-Law <P> For another thing , Wilhelm of Doorn learned , last week , that Emil Ludwig 's savage best-seller Wilhelm Hohenzollern , The Last of the Kaisers ( TIME , March 21 , 1927 ) is being dramatized for simultaneous production in Manhattan and Berlin this winter . Last winter Berlin courts sustained a suit for injunction against Communist Producer Edwin Piscator ( TIME , Dec. 26 ) , which was brought by Wilhelm of Doorn to compel censorship of a stage " Kaiser " from whose mouth came drooling and silly words , punctuated by posturings . <P> Soothing balm was supplied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa which last week restored to Wilhelm II two large farms illegally confiscated from him in 1920.
