Locarno Treaties Signed <P> The Scene . A huge room be-frescoed in tarnished red and gold - the Great Hall of the British Foreign Office . At either side three tall windows , dull-bright with winter sunshine . Down the centre a huge table , covered with blue baize and vermilion-splashed by three official despatch boxes . Around the table a group of the most distin- guished statesmen in Europe-all clad in mourning ( for England 's Dowager Queen ) . At smaller tables other statesmen and ladies-like- wise in black . At one end of the room eight rows of seats , tiered like a grandstand , for the press . Above and over all , the unearthly white-green glare of mercury-vapor arcs . Conspicuous upon a red-draped raised platform , several uncouth persons in sweaters or shirt- sleeves , cranking unceasingly at cinema cameras . Such was the setting , dramatic and bizarre , amid which the famed Locarno Treaties* were signed at London last week . <P> The Preliminaries . Sir Austen Chamberlain , recently knighted British Foreign Secretary , headed the table , with Premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cecil Hurst , famed British jurist , whose duty it was to officially certify the credentials of the plenipotentiaries : M. Briand , Premier and Foreign Minister of France ; Signor Scialoja , head of the Italian delegation to the League of Nations ; MM . Vandervelde , Benes and Skrzynski , respectively Foreign Ministers of Belgium , Czechoslovakia and Poland ; Chancellor Luther and Foreign Minister Stresemann of the German Reich . <P> Speaking in French , the official language of the assembly , Sir Austen first read a greeting from King George , and then lauded extempore the now familiar " spirit of Locarno . " Mr. Baldwin , ever at ease , tilted back his chair and hooked his thumbs in the sleeveholes of his vest . One by one , the plenipotentiaries rose and spoke for a moment on the great step toward peace they were about to take . <P> Only the delegates of the Reich spoke in German . The characteristics of the speakers were described+ as follows : <P> Dr. Luther : " Twinkling-eyed . . . loudly guttural . " <P> Herr Stresemann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pounding on the table . . . glancing shrewdly at his hearers . . . the best orator of all . " <P> M. Vandervelde : " Calm , incisive , quietly confident . " <P> Signor Scialoja : " Day dreaming . . . had to be reminded of his turn to speak . . . voluble . " <P> M. Benes : " A soft , meek voice . " <P> Count Skrzynski : " Suave . " <P> Mr. Baldwin ( the only plenipotentiary to speak in English ) : " His usual self . . . very much the English country gentleman ... as ever , a John Bull . " <P> The Signatures . Sir Cecil Hurst , taking the Rhineland Security Treaty from an envelope , presented it first** to Dr. Luther and Herr Stresemann , who " laboriously affixed their names without flourishes . . . their bald heads like immense pearls under the powerful spotlights.
