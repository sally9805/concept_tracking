Last week was celebrated the first anniversary of the establishment of the Union of Socialist , Soviet Republics ( U. S. S. R.* ) . <P> The place chosen for this celebration was the famed Houdinka Field , near Moscow , now used as an aerodrome , where in 1894 , at the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II , thousands of people were accidentally trampled to death as they scrambled for free food and wine . A Bolshevik , glowing with pride , said that " our organization is perfected to prevent a repetition of the disaster . " An elderly woman nearby shuddered and crossed herself . <P> Assembled upon this field of sad memories were half a million souls . Red officers and soldiers in many uniforms ; workers in white and blue blouses ; Communist athletes , male and female , the former naked except for a pair of trunks , the latter clothed in white shirts and short blue knickers ; English Communists from the Clyde , dressed in sombre Sunday-go-to-meeting garments ; Communist boys and girls , " sweating in black leather suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Pioneers , " Bolshevik Boy Scouts , attired in skin-tight red bathing suits ; girls in cotton frocks ; Cheka battalions , for protection , whose blue helmets added yet another splash of color . And last , but not least , Mohammedans from Turkestan and the Tartar Republic , draped in multicolored flowing robes , and a great Caucasian tribesman in an ample gray cloak over which were slung cartridge bandoleers , a sword-belt holding many silver knives and supporting a wicked-looking scimitar . <P> Centre of attraction was a three-storied , wooden pyramid " 40 feet high . " Here soldiers stood in lines to form pathways to the pyramid . A shout was heard ; then gathering force , like a mighty wind lashing itself into a tornado , the shout increased to a dull reverberant roar ; along the pathways came the leader of Russia . Then deal silence . Suddenly a score or more of bands struck up the Internationale and down one of the aisles came some French Communists from the Department of the Seine to present to Peasant Kalinin , Chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Paris Commune ( Europe 's first encounter with Karl Marx Communism ) - the last to go over the barricades when the French regulars from Versailles crushed the Reds . In the centre of the delegation fluttered from a pole the faded red flag ; on the top of the pyramid Kalinin received it and it found its way to a deputation of Moscow workers waiting to receive it . Then there were a number of speeches followed by an awkward skit on recognition of Russia , which attempted to show , not without much buffoonery , how anxious the foreign Powers were to accord recognition . <P> Under the fading light of a July day , 500,000 thronged back to the ancient city of Moscow , scene of a thousand historical acts . <P> <P> *The U S. S. R. was established by Treaty of Union signed in 1922 by the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic ( Russia proper , Turkestan , Kirghiz , Tartar , Bashkir , Mountain Republic , Daghestan , Crimea , Votiak , Mari , Chuvash , German Volga areas , the Far Eastern region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian S S R. and the Transcaucasian Socialist Federal S. R. The Treaty was ratified last January .
