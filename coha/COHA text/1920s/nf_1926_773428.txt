txt you will be the President of the United States , and that you will do honor to your name , to the United States , and to the high office you will occupy . We are Republicans , and we do not propose to leave our party and identify ourselves with the party of Rum , Romanism , and Rebellion . " At these last words , so blazingly indiscreet when publicly addressed to a candidate who hoped to carry New York with the aid of Catholic votes , Blaine stood motionless and apparently attentive . But he was either not listening , or the significance of what was said escaped him . Other ministers made eulogistic addresses , Blaine replied in a few well-chosen words , the throng pressed up to shake his hand , and the meeting came to an end . In less than twenty-four hours every Democratic paper in the country had spread before its readers the fatal alliteration , every Catholic voter in the State knew that the Republican candidate had permitted a slur against his religion to go unrebuked .

The Democratic candidate , Grover Cleveland , carried New York State by 1,149 votes , and New York gave him the Presidency by the electoral vote of 219 to 182 . The inauguration of the first Democratic President since Buchanan was favored by smiling skies and balmy spring air . A stand in front of the Capitol was crowded with Senators , Representatives , members of the Supreme Court , foreign diplomats , and other distinguished guests . The throng which faced this platform spread out over the Capitol grounds into the surrounding streets and avenues , while various military organizations , resting on their arms , added to the brilliancy of the scene . The trees were filled with onlookers , and the roofs of near-by houses were crowded . At half-past twelve the procession emerged from the Capitol , headed by President Arthur , President-elect Cleveland , Chief Justice Waite , and the Sergeant-at-Arms . As they advanced to the front of the stand and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes later Cleveland began his inaugural address . The crowd saw a large man dressed in black , with Prince Albert coat , high standing collar , and black tie . His massive head , firm mouth , high forehead , and steady blue eyes gave the impression of fearlessness , strength , and honesty . As he spoke , he kept his left hand behind him , and gesticulated with his right . He had no manuscript , but from time to time he consulted a small slip of paper upon which he had jotted down brief notes . He touched upon various topics of interest , upon harmony within the Union , upon the need of civil-service reform , upon economy , upon non-intervention in Europe , upon the national domain , upon the treatment of the former slaves . But other matters which were agitating the nation ? big business , the tariff , and the currency ? he failed to mention . The radical elements , especially in the West , were deeply dissatisfied . There is no hope in either of the old parties , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dare not take any measures for the relief of the people . We must organize a new party , pledged to overthrow the gold standard , to lower the tariff , and to destroy the trusts , so that we can sweep out of power both Republicans and Democrats . As it turned out , Cleveland soon became the champion of one of the pet measures of the West . The high tariff level established during the Civil War was still maintained , because the manufacturers had insisted that lower customs would mean foreign competition , with reduced wages and non-employment . But the farmers had long protested . They contended that the protective tariff raised the price of manufactured goods , stimulated the creation of great corporations , and made the rich richer and the poor poorer ; that it was a burdensome tax on the people for the benefit of a small group of manufacturers . Their hearts warmed to Cleveland when he came out openly for lower rates . The President in his messages several times mentioned the need of tariff reform . But the industrial interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In ) enabler , 1887 , Cleveland decided to devote an entire message to this one subject . His advisers warned him that he was signing his own political death-warrant , but he held to his purpose . He called the attention of Congress to the fact that " while comparatively few use imported articles , millions purchase and use things of the same kind made in this country , and pay therefor nearly or quite the same enhanced price which the duty adds to the imported article . Those who pay the imposts pay the duty charged thereon into the public treasury , but the great majority of our citizens , who buy domestic articles of the same class , pay . . . to the home manufacturer . " This message made the tariff the leading issue in the campaign of 1888 . The Republicans denounced Cleveland as a " free trader , " an enemy of American industry , and a friend of the British manufacturers . The Democrats rallied to his support , but the country was not yet ripe for radical tariff reduction , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective principle was saved , and in 1890 the Republicans put through the McKinley tariff bill , with rates above even the war level . The McKinley Act was an extremely radical measure . The framers of earlier bills had been careful not to lay imposts on articles used in every household , but this act taxed clothing , tools , carpets , table linen , shoes , everything . Although the Republicans boasted that it was " protective in every paragraph , and American in every line and word , " some of them had a premonition that things had been carried too far . It proved a boomerang . Even before it became law , but when its passage was a certainty , there was a perceptible rise in the cost of living . A few months later prices jumped , and every household learned that the family income had been reduced , and that the dinner-basket held less than before . At the same time , wages remained stationary , while the farmers were grieved to see a fall in the price of grain . From all sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the culminating atrocity of class legislation . " The elections for Congress in 1890 proved a landslide for the Democrats . It was almost universally believed that Harrison 's election had ended forever Grover Cleveland 's political career . His insistence upon forcing an unpopular issue upon his party on the eve of a presidential election elicited the contempt of the proA // fessional politicians . So they relegated him to what they considered a well-deserved obscurity . " Cleveland in New York reminds one of a stone thrown into a river , " said Henry Watterson . " There is a plunk , ' a splash , and then silence . " The politicians did not reckon on the reaction against the McKinley tariff . When it became obvious that the issue which had brought defeat to the Democrats in 1888 would bring them victory in 1892 , the party could not pass over the man who had forced that issue to the fore . In the national convention the machine politicians made a strenuous effort to prevent Cleveland 's nomination , but from the first the tide ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , " said William C. Whitney , who had charge of his campaign . " They tumble in at the windows as well as at the doors . " On the first ballot Cleveland received 617 votes , 10 more than the two-thirds necessary for nomination . The Republicans named President Harrison for a second term , but his warmest supporters realized that his chances of re-election were small . Cleveland carried New York , Connecticut , Indiana , and other pivotal States , and received 277 votes to 145 for his opponent . But disappointment was in store . When a tariff bill was introduced providing for free raw materials , for an appreciable reduction on factory-made articles , for increased duties on liquors , and for an income tax , it was found impossible to hold some of the Democratic Senators in line . A London fishdealer once remarked : " I am in favor of free trade in everything but herring . " The Senators from Maryland , West Virginia , and Alabama refused to give up the protection on coal and iron ; the Senators from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various interests had so transformed the bill that Cleveland bluntly declared it a sad memorial of " party perfidy and party dishonor . " But he felt that it was preferable to the McKinley Act , and permitted it to become a law without his signature . Even before the passage of this unsatisfactory measure , thousands of Western farmers had turned against Cleveland and the Democratic party . They felt that his policies offered them no hope of relief . And the West was in desperate need // of relief at this moment , for the price of agricultural products had fallen to new depths . Wheat was selling at less than fifty cents a bushel , corn was so cheap that in places it was burned for fuel . A long series of droughts had parched the fields , withered the growing grain , and brought despair to the farmers . The annual corn production of Kansas and Nebraska fell from 287,816,000 bushels in 1885 to 110,579,000 bushels in 1889 . Unable to make ends meet , the farmers borrowed heavily from Eastern bankers and capitalists . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kansas , found that of 3,000 farms , 1,727 were burdened with mortgages amounting to nearly a million and a half dollars . " The virgin soil of the West is rapidly ceasing to be the home and possession of the sturdy American freeman , " declared a writer in the Forum . " He is but a tenant at will , or dependent upon the tender mercies of corporations and absentee landlords . We have abolished monarchy and primogeniture and church establishments supported by the state , yet the universal curse of humanity , the monopoly of the earth by the wealthy few , remains . " A wave of despair passed over the West , and the farmers turned for relief to direct political action . During the administrations of Garfield and Arthur local associations of farmers had sprung up in the West and South , which soon began to merge , first into State bodies and later into a national federation known as the Farmers ' Alliance . Into this great society rushed many fanatics , loud in their complaints of calamity and insistent upon radical remedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who went about exhorting the farmers to " raise less corn and more hell , " and Governor Waite , of Colorado , who warned the Eastern capitalists that he was prepared to ride in blood up to his bridles . I n 1892 the Farmers ' Alliance joined hands with the Knights of Labor to create the Peoples ' Party , or Populists . At a mamoth convention in Omaha , on July 2 , this movement NN as launched amid scenes of intense excitement . The adoption of the platform was greeted by " cheers and yells which rose like a tornado . . . and raged without cessation for thirty-four minutes , during which women shrieked and wept , men emA // braced . . . and leaped upon tables and chairs in the ecstasy of delight . " The new party nominated James B. Weaver , of Iowa , for the Presidency , and demanded a graduated income tax , government ownership of railways and telegraphs , a shorter work-day , the direct election of United States Senators , and the free coinage of silver at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold . Around the last of these issues was destined to rage in the next four years one of the fiercest political battles in the nation 's history . Prior to 1873 every citizen was permitted by law to take gold or silver bullion to any of the United States mints , and have it coined into standard dollars at the ratio of sixteen to one . Since , under this arrangement , silver bullion was undervalued , silver dollars had long ago passed out of circulation . No one would pay debts in silver dollars worth $1.02 when he could do so with gold dollars worth 100 cents . There was no protest when , in 1873 , an act was passed quietly rescinding the free coinage of silver . Since that date , however , the opening of great mines in Nevada , Utah , Colorado , and Montana had deluged the country with silver , and the price of the metal dropped rapidly . In 1872 the content of the old silver dollar was $1.02 ; in 1875 it was 96 cents ; in 1885 only 82 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocates of cheap money that , had it not been for the act of 1873 , the silver dollars would have driven gold out of circulation , and the country would have been upon a silver basis . Prices would then have gone up , and the hard-pressed Western farmers could have lifted the mortgages on their property . The radical leaders denounced bitterly what they called the " crime of 1873 , " asserting that corrupt capitalists had smuggled it through Congress by stealth . For this charge there was no basis . In one of the later debates , when Senator Stewart , of Nevada , was thundering against the " crime , " Senator Sherman put him to rout by showing from the record that Stewart himself had spoken and voted for it . None the less , thousands of men in the West and South now turned to the restoration of the free coinage of gold and silver at the ratio of sixteen to one as their one hope of salvation . // They found in Richard P. Bland , of Missouri , a leader so enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silver Dollar Dick . " In 1877 Bland pushed through the House of Representatives a bill providing for free silver , but in the Senate the measure was blocked . Ile was forced to accept a compromise , offered by W. B. Allison , by which the Treasury Department was directed to purchase from two to four million dollars ' worth of silver bullion each month and coin it into dollars . In 1890 this law was superseded by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act , which required the government to buy each month 4,500,000 ounces of silver bullion , paying for it in new Treasury notes redeemable in either gold or silver at the option of the government . The Sherman Act created great satisfaction in the West , for it added $50,000,000 a year to the substitute money in circulation , and gave promise that the country would soon be upon a silver basis . The government 's meagre gold reserve had to support not only $346,681,016 in greenbacks , but the accumulating mass of Treasury notes . In the last months of Harrison 's administration the reserve began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Treasury , and from all sides the notes poured in for redemption in gold . President Cleveland , who had already announced his intention of maintaining the gold standard , a few months after his inauguration called an extra session of Congress to consider the condition of the currency . Despite the frantic opposition of the silver men , the Sherman Act was repealed . Yet the situation remained critical . The leak in the financial dike had been stopped , but the flood of money which swamped the country had not been drained off . The reserve continued to sink , and finally Secretary Carlisle began selling bonds to prevent its complete exhaustion . This proved a discouraging operation . Of $58,660,917 in gold coin which the first bond issue yielded , 824,396,459 had been obtained beforehand from the Treasury by presenting legal tender for redemption . " What was poured in through the funnel was first drawn out through the bunghole . " March 6 , 1894 , the reserve had been restored to $107,000,000 ; but by August 7 it had fallen to $52,000,000 // and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $41,000 , - 000 . This was a slender store , indeed , with which to secure the half-billion dollars of notes still in circulation . President Cleveland was perplexed . The inadequate results obtained from the bond issues had been in part the result of restrictions imposed by the Resumption Act of 1875 upon the rate of interest and the length of time they should run . To resort to the old expedient seemed a matter of doubtful wisdom . Moreover , both Mr. Cleveland and Secretary Carlisle had scruples against selling bonds without the authorization of the existing Congress . But when , after much delay , the President asked for an issue of fifty-year bonds at a low rate of interest , the silver majority blocked him . For the moment it seemed that the gold standard was doomed . On February 7 , 1895 , J. Pierpont Morgan , accompanied by Robert Bacon , walked hurriedly across Lafayette Square , in Washington , to the White House . There they were greeted , rather formally , by President Cleveland , Secretary Carlisle , and Attorney-General Olney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President was not smoking , and so , out of courtesy , refrained , from lighting the cigar which he held in his hand . The President explained that he had decided to offer bonds for popular subscription , and wished Mr. Morgan 's assistance in bolstering up the reserve until the gold had begun to come in . He then began discussing the situation with Carlisle and Olney , while Morgan and Bacon listened . At last a message came in stating that there were but $9,000 , - 000 of gold left in the New York Subtreasury . " Mr. President , " said Morgan , " the Secretary of the Treasury knows of one check outstanding for $1 ' 2,000,000 . If this is presented it is all over . " Deeply moved at the imminence of the crisis , Cleveland turned to the financier and said : " Have you anything to suggest ? " Thereupon Morgan replied that during the Civil War a law had been passed authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase coin upon such terms as lie deemed wise , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of his embarrassment . Olney stepped Out of I he room and in a moment returned with the book of Revised // Statutes . Cleveland took the book , and with deep concentration read the act , while every one in the room sat in suspense . At last the President laid the book slowly on his desk , saying : " Mr. Morgan , I think the act is ample for our needs , and that it will solve the situation . " The tension was broken . Cleveland entered into a contract with Morgan and his associates , by which the bankers agreed to furnish the Treasury with 3,500,000 ounces of gold coin , to be paid for in 4-per-cent bonds , running thirty years . When this had been decided , Cleveland 's face once more became grave . " How about this drain of gold abroad ? " he asked . " Suppose the government does purchase this gold from the bankers , and it is immediately withdrawn from the Treasury and sent abroad . Can you guarantee that such a thing will not happen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will so guarantee , " he said . As Morgan rose to go , some one noticed a brown powder on his clothes and on the floor around his chair . It proved to be the cigar he had held in his hand , which in the tenseness of the situation he had ground to pieces . The President 's eleventh-hour move in purchasing gold saved the day . Confidence was restored , gold exports were checked , and not until January 6 , 1896 , was it necessary to make another bond issue . Eventually expanding trade , with its new demands for currency , brought the drain upon the gold reserve to an end . The free-silver men were frantic with anger . Here is the President , who set himself up as the enemy of privilege and the friend of the people , they said , and what does he do ? Why , instead of redeeming Treasury notes in silver , as the law allows , he buys gold from a syndicate at usurious rates and adds millions to the national debt . All through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's following melted away Populism rose on a new high tide . It became increasingly evident that Populism was on the verge of gaining control of the Democratic party . The South had joined hands with the West in demanding free silver , and the conventions of thirty States had passed resolutions conA // demning the gold standard . When the Democratic convention assembled in the Coliseum at Chicago on July 7 , 1896 , the radical element , men desirous of shaking off the domination of the East , found themselves in the ascendancy . As they marched , shouted , and sang , unheedful of the sweltering summer 's heat , it was obvious that many of them were determined to " smash things . " The conservative members from the East , David B. Hill , Roswell P. Flower , Arthur P. Gorman , and others , looked on with amazement and disgust , but they were powerless to stem the tide . The Committee on Resolutions reported a platform devoted chiefly to the money question . " We demand the free and unlimited coinage of both silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , " they said , " without waiting for the aid or consent of any other nation . We demand that the standard silver dollar shall be a full legal tender , equally with gold , for all debts , public and private . " The conservative leaders pleaded against this surrender of the Democratic party to the cheapmoney group , but their words were lost in the howling and stamping of 15,000 men and women . After David B. Hill , W. F. Vilas , and W. E. Russell had spoken , William Jennings Bryan , of Nebraska , was seen to approach the platform , and , ascending two steps at a time , take his stand before the audience . His appearance was striking . The smooth-shaven , almost boyish face , the heavy head with its wavy black hair , the square chin , wide mouth , large , lustrous dark eyes , aquiline nose , square shoulders gave the impression of earnestness , dignity , and power . " Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the convention , " he began in a melodious , ringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast Coliseum , " I should be presumptuous , indeed , to present myself against the distinguished gentlemen to whom you have listened , if this were a mere measuring of abilities ; but this is not a contest between persons . The humblest citizen of the land , when clad in the armor of a righteous cause , is stronger than all the hosts of error . I come to speak to you in defense of a cause as holy as the cause of liberty  --  the cause of humanity . " Turning to the gold delegates , // he continued : " When you come before us and tell us that we are about to disturb your business interests , we reply that you have disturbed our business interests by your course . We say to you that you have made the definition of a business man too limited in its application . " The man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his employer . The attorney in a country town is as much a business man as the corporation counsel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as much a business man as the merchant of New York . The farmer who goes forth in the morning and toils all day ? who begins in the spring and toils all summer ? and who , by the application of brain and muscle to the natural resources of the country , creates wealth , is as much a business man as the man who goes upon the board of trade and bets upon the price of grain . . . . " We do not come as aggressors . Our war is not a war of conquest ; we are fighting in defense of our homes , our families , and property . We have petitioned , and our petitions have been scorned . We have entreated , and our entreaties have been disregarded . We have begged , and they have mocked when our calamity came . We beg no longer ; we entreat no more ; we petition no more . We defy them . . . . " We care not upon what lines the battle is fought . If they say bimetallism is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations help us , we reply that , instead of having a gold standard because England has , we will restore bimetallism , and then let England have bimetallism because the United States has it . If they dare to come out into the open field and defend the gold standard as a good thing , we will fight them to the uttermost . Having behind us the producing masses of the nation and the world , the laboring interests , and the toilers everywhere , we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them : You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns ? you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold . " At the conclusion of this address ensued a scene of the wildest enthusiasm . Delegation after delegation rose , shouting and // waving hats , handkerchiefs , flags , canes , umbrellas . The spectators joined in the demonstration . A Texas delegate started a procession of the silver men , and for many minutes they marched around the floor , holding up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing . It was obvious that the Democratic party had found its leader , and the next day Bryan was nominated for the Presidency . The West was elated , but the disgust of the East knew no bounds . " Lunacy having dictated the platform , it was perhaps natural that hysteria should evolve the candidate , " was the comment of the New York World . The campaign was full of excitement and of bitterness . The Republicans had reaffirmed their allegiance to the gold standard and had nominated William McKinley , of Ohio . McKinley was a man of winning personality . But his association with Marcus A. Hanna and other wealthy business men cost him the support of many to whom the trusts in politics were still the leading issue . Bryan fought a good battle . Travelling all over the country , he harangued multitudes , everywhere dwelling on the iniquity of the gold standard , extolling the virtues of the working man , and pleading ; for free silver . The Republican press answered with bitter personal attacks . " Rattle-headed idiot , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were some of the epithets hurled at Mr. Bryan . As the summer drew to an end , a feeling akin to terror passed over the East . Contracts were made contingent upon the election of McKinley ; employees were notified that they need not return to work in the event of Democratic success ; vast quantities of " literature " were distributed describing the ruin which would follow the abandonment of the gold standard ; contributions from business men poured in upon the Republican headquarters . The Saturday before the election 150,000 New Yorkers ? lawyers , doctors , clergymen , bankers , merchants , clerks ? marched up Broadway , waving flags and cheering for McKinley and sound money . In the end the Republicans won the day . Confronted with the choice between the triumph of big business in politics and the overthrow of the gold standard , the American voters chose the former . McKinley won by a vote of 271 to 176 in the electoral college , and a popular vote of 7,111,607 to 6,509,052 . Though the inflationists lost at the polls , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold-mines were opened in the frozen wastes of the Klondike , new processes of treating the ore were put into practice , and the precious metal in vast quantities began to pour upon the world market . Under the weight of this golden flood the value of the dollar sank and commodity prices rose . With wheat selling for $1.50 , and with the Western farmers rapidly paying off their mortgages , the cry of free silver lost much of its charm . The agrarian West to this day has its grievances , still complains of the oppression of Wall Street , but the demand for cheap money has almost ceased . The building up of the Far West is an event of great importance in American history . This region , so recently a wilderness , is now full of thriving communities . Where once were deserts are now alfalfa-fields or apple orchards ; in place of empty prairies are prosperous farms where the proprietor tends his wheat , corn , cotton , or rice ; the great river is now but a tiny rivulet , for its waters have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lonely trails have given way to concrete roads , crowded with automobiles ; along the shores are cities with modern hotels , wharves , mills , factories , and paved streets . The growth of the West , especially of the Far West , had its roots in the soil . It was in large part in response to the reclamation of arid land through irrigation works , fostered and aided by the Federal Government , that prosperity came to this region . In California , Idaho , Oregon , Washington , Montana , and Wyoming waste places have been made to bloom . In Arizona the great Roosevelt dam , which was completed in 1911 , straddles the Salt River and creates a lake 240 feet deep , containing 400,000,000,000 gallons of water . The Arrowrock dam , in Idaho , is even larger , being 354 feet high ; the Sun River dam , in Montana , is 329 feet high ; the Elephant Butte dam , in New Mexico , 318 feet high ; the Shoshone dam , in Wyoming , 328 feet high . // These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the decade from 1900 to 1910 the population of the Far West increased 66.8 per cent . Washington and Idaho more than doubled ; California , Oregon , and Arizona increased 60 per cent ; while the cities of Los Angeles , Seattle , Spokane , Portland , Tacoma , and Oakland enjoyed phenomenal growth . In the years from 1910 to 1920 , although the rate of increase was less rapid , the Far West gained a full 30 per cent , while the country as a whole gained only 14.9 . For many decades the Far West bore to the East the relation of a colony to the mother country . It sent across the continent its food and its raw material , and received in return the manufactured goods essential to its economic life . But in re ' cent years it has been rapidly shaking off this dependency by developing great industrial plants of its own . To-day thousands of skilled workmen are employed in the shipyards of the Pacific coast ; mills for the manufacture of motors , tractors , and trucks are flourishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco and Portland are developing soap-factories ; while in various , places are furniture-plants , cotton-mills , shoe-factories , and paper-mills . Nothing more clearly shows the prosperity of the Far West than the rapid increase in the number of automobiles . In 1915 the number of cars in the three coast States of Washington , Oregon , and California was 169,701 ; in 1919 it had increased to 414,685 ; in 1921 to 847,682 , and in 1925 to 1,427,471 . To-day California alone has a population of 4,000,000 . Its wealth is estimated at $15,000,000,000 , its railway mileage is 8,282 , there are 29,365,667 acres of cultivated land , of which 4,219,040 acres are irrigated . In 1920 its crops were valued at $589,757,000 , its dairy products at $276,424,000 , its petroleum output was 263,729,000 barrels , while its factories turned out goods to the value of $1,901,204,701 . The rapid development of the West has eliminated the frontier with its distinctive life and influence ; has added enormously to the agricultural output of the country , and saved it from dependence upon foreign lands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to absorb the stream of immigrants which // for decades poured unchecked upon our shores ; increased many times over our trade in the Pacific ; involved the nation in the problems of the Far East ; added millions to the population , hundreds of millions to the annual output , and billions to the national wealth . I T did not occur to the founders of the Republic that the day would come when the United States would seek to acquire distant possessions . With the West inviting settlement , in the early days there was little temptation for expansion overseas . Why search for crumbs , with a splendid banquet spread at home ? But a century later , when the last frontier was disappearing , and when American production was outstripping domestic needs , the United States began to reach out , first for world trade and then for foreign possessions . This movement coincided with the wave of imperialism which swept over Europe in the last two decades of the century , caused by the desire of the great powers to open new markets , secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States took no part in the partition of Africa , nor in the dividing of Turkey and China into spheres of influence , it did seek to enhance and protect its growing commerce by acquiring a limited number of dependencies . Its efforts to maintain the Monroe Doctrine forced it , half reluctantly , to acquire also a position of dominance in Central America and the West Indies . While holding off the hungry European powers with one hand , with the other it compelled its turbulent Latin-American neighbors to respect its interests , economic and political . The State which failed to keep order or pay its obligations , which confiscated alien property , or put itself in pawn to foreign powers , soon felt the correcting hand of the United States . Thus , in two separate parts of the world , in Latin America and the Far East , American diplomacy became increasingly absorbed in the problems of commerce and of a group of dependencies . Far out in the south Pacific lies the group of volcanic islands known as Samoa . Despite the insignificance of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their situation in the track of vessels plying between San Francisco and Australia , and between Cape Horn and the ports of China . Upon the principal island a number of Americans , Germans , and English had settled in the years from 1830 to 1885 , traders and missionaries most of them , and the United States , Germany , and Great Britain all had made treaties with the natives . By 1888 it had become evident that Germany , under the leadership of Bismarck , was determined to get complete control of the islands . Finding that the native King , Malietoa , was favorable to the Americans and English , the Germans seized him , and set up a creature of their own named Tamasese . Civil war followed , with the natives playing the part of pawns , one side directed by the German consul , Herr Becker , and the other by the American consul , Harold M. Sewall . When the German corvette Adler was ordered to shell a native village , the United States gunboat Adams prevented , by placing itself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed to attack the native camp , it was an American named Klein who took the lead in driving them back . This resistance to their plans aroused the Germans to fury . " Germans swear vengeance , " cabled Vice-Consul Blacklock . " Shelling and burning indiscriminately , regardless of American property . Protest unheeded . Natives exasperated . Foreigners ' lives and property in greatest danger . Germans respect no neutral territory . Americans in boats flying .

Soon the Nipsic , the Vandalia , and the old sea-fighter Trenton were lying beside the Adams in Apia harbor . They found there the British cruiser Calliope , and a German squadron consisting of the Adler , the Eber , and the Olga . The decks of all the vessels were cleared for action , and so tense was the situation that a single rash act might have provoked a war . As it turned out , the assembling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a disaster caused by the hand of nature , not by man . The harbor of Apia is formed by a circular chain of coral reefs about a mile in circumference , having but one narrow outlet . Into this small space were crowded the seven men-ofwar , a merchant ship , and numerous smaller vessels , all anchored in dangerous proximity to each other . About four o'clock on the afternoon of March 15 , 1889 , a storm broke over the harbor which grew in violence throughout the night , until with the approach of dawn it had become a hurricane . The water , lashed by the wind , swept over the ships , threatening to engulf them or to tear them loose from their anchors and hurl them upon each other or upon the beach . The sailors worked heroically to avert disaster . Here and there one could distinguish through the murky atmosphere the dim outline of vessels , tossing and rolling . The little gunboat Eber was the first to succumb . She was dashed against the reef with terrific force and was seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe position , whence most of the crew escaped over hawsers fastened by tile natives to trees . The Adler was lifted by a gigantic wave and thrown on its side high upon the reef ; the Vandalia was beached broadside to the sea , where for hours she was pounded by the waves ; the Trenton went aground upon a projecting ledge of coral . When the hurricane was at its height , the crew of the Trenton , which then was drifting helplessly , saw looming up through the gloom the hull and spars of the Calliope . " My anchors are gone , " shouted Captain Kane , " and I am going to try to force my way out to sea . " With every pound of steam crowded on and with boilers red hot , the British cruiser fought its way forward in the face of the wind . As they passed , the 400 American tars on the Trenton swarmed up into the rigging to send after them a cheer of " Godspeed . " With almost certain death staring them in the face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune of others . " When we saw the noble conduct of the Trenton 's crew , " Captain Kane afterward reported , " and heard them , in the face of a fate even more certain than our own , cheer us on in our perilous path , all traces of listlessness and insubordination vanished , and I knew that the Calliope was safe . " The news of this disaster dispelled all thought of war . ( hi April 29 , 1889 , a joint commission of the three powers concerned met in Berlin to devise means for a peaceful solution of the Samoan problem . Bismarck did his best to frighten the English and American delegates into recognizing Germany 's political predominance in the islands , but in vain . He was compelled to sign an agreement under which M1Vlalietoa was restored to his throne , and an equal protectorate of the three powers established . The Samoan incident marks the beginning of a new epoch in American diplomatic history . It was the first assertion by the United States , as John Bassett Moore has said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , to take part in determining the fate of a remote and semibarbarous people , whose possessions lay far outside the traditional sphere of American political interests . " A few years later , then , when the Government took steps leading to the annexation of Hawaii , the people accepted it as the continuation of the new policy . The Hawaiian Islands , situated midway between San Francisco and the Philippines , for many decades had enjoyed good government under a line of wise native rulers . But when King Kalahaua , who came to the throne in 1873 , reversed the policy of his ancestors and gave himself up to wastefulness and vice , many leading citizens , both white and native , combined to force upon him a liberal constitution . In 1891 Kalahaua was succeeded by his sister , Liliuokalani . The new queen was a woman of regal bearing and broad education , but she was bent on ruling as a despot . In less than two years she had driven the people into rebellion . Early in 1893 the best elements of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sanford B. Dole , and appealed to the American minister , John L. Stevens , for aid in preserving order . At Stevens 's request a battalion of soldiers and marines , coming ashore from the United States cruiser Boston , encamped before the government building . " I must yield , " said Liliuokalani , " because I can not resist the superior forces of the United States of America . " A few weeks later a delegation from the new government appeared before President Harrison to ask that the United States take over the islands . A treaty of annexation was hastily drawn up , signed by the President , and submitted to the Senate for ratification . " The restoration of Queen Liliuokalani to her throne is undesirable , if not impossible , " said Mr. Harrison in his message to the Senate , " and unless actively supported by the United States , would be accompanied by serious disaster and the disorganization of all business interests . . . . It is essential that none of the great powers shall secure these islands . Such a possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world . " Yet serious opposition arose to annexation and the Senate thought it best to let the matter rest until President Cleveland entered the White House . As it turned out , Cleveland condemned the whole programme , and advised the restoration of the Queen . But Congress refused to sanction the use of American soldier and sailors in overthrowing the government of President Dole , voting May 31 , 1894 , not to interfere further in Hawaii . The republic continued to govern the islands until 1898 , when , with the Republican party once more in power at Washington , a resolution of annexation passed the House of Representatives 209 to 91 , and the Senate 42 to 21 . In 1900 the islands were organized as a Territory , and its citizens made citizens of the United States . While the Hawaiian affair was still hanging fire , an incident occurred which was destined to exert a far-reaching influence upon the foreign policy of the United States . When , on the evening of December 17 , 1895 , the people of England went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred thousand who did not suppose that the most amicable relations existed between Great Britain and the United States . The next morning , when they read their newspapers , they were amazed to learn that a crisis existed which might well lead the two nations into war . " What is the Venezuelan question ? " the average Britisher asked himself , rubbing his eyes . " What is the Schomburgk line ? Why is the United States so interested in the matter ? ' Why has the British Govcrn ! lieu t permitted an insignificant question to bring us to the verge of catastrophe ? " // For a full half-century Venezuela and British Guiana had engaged in a boundary dispute . In 1841 Great Britain had made claims to a large expanse of territory regarded by the Venezuelans as their own , and had employed a surveyor named Schomburgk to run the boundary line . The Government of Venezeula protested vigorously . They were especially concerned because the Schomburgk line ran to the mouth of the Orinoco River , the control of which was essential to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter to arbitration were rejected by Great Britain . Later , when gold was discovered west of the Schomburgk line , England extended her claim to include the region containing the mines . Finally , in despair , Venezuela appealed to the United States . Protracted negotiations ensued between Washington and London , in which the American Secretaries of State earnestly requested Great Britain to accept arbitration . It was obvious , so they reasoned , that any encroachment upon the territory of an American country under pretense of fixing a boundary endangered the Monroe Doctrine . The crisis came in Cleveland 's second administration . On July 20 , 1895 , Secretary Olney sent a long despatch to London , tracing the history of the Monroe Doctrine , explaining how it applied to the Venezuelan question , and once more urging arbitration . Unless there was a satisfactory settlement , he said , it would " greatly embarrass the future relations between this country and Great Britain . " Strangely enough , Lord Salisbury , the British Foreign Minister , seems not to have recognized the serious purport of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then delivered Olney a lecture upon international law and diplomatic usage . The Monroe Doctrine , he explained , had nothing to do with the dispute . " The dangers which were apprehended by President Monroe have no relation to the state of things in which we live at the present day . " Therefore the Venezuelan affair in no way concerned the United States . As for arbitration , it was a procedure open to many objections . " The claim of a third nation which is unaffected by the controversy to impose this particular procedure on either of the two others can not be reasonably justified , and has no foundation in the law of nations . " Cleveland was greatly angered , both by the condescending tone of this reply and by its blunt refusal , to recognize the rights of the United States . He decided upon heroic measures . All through the night of December 16 , 1895 , he sat at his desk working upon a message , which the next day was read before Congress . It was a stirring paper . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commission to determine , after careful investigation , " the true boundary line between the Republic of Venezuela and British Guiana , " and expressed the opinion that , when the line had been ascertained , it would be the duty of the United States to uphold it " by every means in its power . " " In making these recommendations , " he said , " I am fully aware of the responsibility incurred and keenly realize all the consequences that may follow . . . . There is no calamity which a great nation can invite which equals that which follows a supine submission to wrong and injustice . " Although this message took the American people by surprise , they did not hesitate . Congress voted $100,000 for the expenses of the commission , the press rang with patriotic utterances , the governors of many States voiced approval and promised support . In England the people were at first inclined to look upon the message as an unprovoked insult . The London Times denounced jingoism in the White House , declaring that the whole affair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unthinkable , it declared . None the less , yield England did . On New Year 's Day 354 members of the House of Commons sent a memorial to the President and Congress asking that , in the future , differences between the United States and Great Britain be referred to arbitration . As this was just what Mr. Cleveland was contending for , it augured well for a peaceful solution . In the end public opinion in England veered around to the conclusion that the game was not worth the candle . Lord Salisbury was severely condemned for permitting an inconsequential dispute in far-off South America to drift into a casus belli with England 's // natural friend and best customer . Forced to recede from their original position , the government consented with what grace they could to submit the points in dispute to a tribunal of arbitration , and the Venezuelan affair was ended . It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of this victory . " It has established the Monroe Doctrine on lasting foundations before the eyes of the world , " wrote Mr. Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the respect and consideration of the people of all nations , and especially of Great Britain ; it has confirmed our confidence in the overwhelming prevalence among our citizens of disinterested devotion to American honor . " As the sky was clearing and peace with England was assured , another war-cloud made its appearance on the horizon . Directly south of Florida , basking under semitropical skies , beautiful with its many-colored cities , its fields of sugar-cane and rich tobacco plantations , is the island of Cuba . The Pearl of the Antilles it is called . This charming place was for centuries a prey to misgovernment and oppressions . Proud Spanish officials monopolized every post of honor , robbed the natives , and subjected them to indignities . The island was frequently torn with rebellion . Guerilla bands would raid the plantations of the ruling class , and , after spreading destruction , retire to the mountains or the jungle . In 1896 the Queen Regent of Spain sent General Valeriano Weyler to Cuba . Unable to distinguish the loyal natives from the rebels , this officer attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch by herding them together in the vicinity of the fortified towns . Here the unhappy " reconcentrados , " penned in like cattle , with foul air , foul water , and foul food , perished by the thousand . Their condition excited pity and indignation in the United States . The American people had long been interested in Cuba . " It lies so near to us as to be hardly separated from our territory , " President Cleveland pointed out . " Our actual pecuniary interest in it is second only to that of the people and government of Spain . It is reasonably estimated that at least from $30 , - 000,000 to $50,000,000 of American capital are invested in plantations and in railroad , mining , and other business enterprises on the island . The volume of trade between the United States and Cuba , which in 1889 amounted to about $64,000 , - 000 , rose in 1893 to about $103,000,000 . " Obviously we could not be indifferent to unending turmoil produced by Spanish inefficiency . On June 27 , 1897 , Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , protesting against Weyler 's inhuman conduct . For his pains he received a reply from the Spanish Foreign Minister , intimating that Weyler had acted with no greater severity than General Sherman , the Secretary 's own brother , in his famous march to the sea during the American Civil War . None the less , Weyler was recalled , and a grant of autonomy for Cuba published . It seemed that war would be avoided . But the Cuban insurgents insisted upon unqualified independence , while the ruling class was furious at the sacrifice of their old privileges . Mobs paraded through the streets of Havana , cheering for Weyler and cursing President McKinley and the United States . At this juncture General Fitzhugh Lee , our consul-general at Havana , advised the government that the presence of a war-ship in Cuban waters was necessary for the protection of American interests . On January 25 , the second-class battleship Maine steamed into Havana harbor past the battlements of Morro Castle , and was conducted to her anchorage next to the Spanish cruiser Alfonso XII . At twenty minutes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all was still aboard the Maine . The small boats had been hoisted , most of the crew had turned in , and the anchor watch was dispersed about the deck . A sentry paced back and forth , gazing at the twinkling lights of the harbor and the dim outlines of the old castle . Suddenly there came a blinding flash of light , accompanied by a roar as though the bottom of the ship were groaning in agony . Fragments could be seen flying through the air ? pieces of cement , blocks of wood , steel railings , bits of grating ? and then a cloud of black smoke . From the forward part of the ship , where the crew were quart ( Ted , came groans , shrieks , and cries for help . There followed a t reinbling and lurching motion , then a heavy list to purl , and thy ? // vessel began to sink . Captain Sigsbee , cool and collected , directed the lowering of the boats , and then , at the last moment , gave the order : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next morning , as the sun rose over Havana harbor , a twisted mass of blackened steel was all that was visible of the once proud battleship . A cry of anger and horror went up from the people of the United States . Who is responsible for this disaster ? they asked . Can it be that the Spaniards anchored the Maine over a mine with the purpose of destroying her ? Have they taken this means of diminishing the naval power of the United States on the eve of war ? When a board of naval experts examined the hull and reported that the condition of the armorplates indicated that the explosion had been external , indignation rose to fever-heat . War was inevitable . Although President McKinley still hung back , he was pushed into hostilities by Congress and the nation . " Every Congressman has two or three newspapers in his district , most of them printed in red ink and shouting for blood , " declared Mr. Boutelle , of Maine , on March 30 . Twelve days later the President sent a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing peace to Cuba . " In the name of humanity , " he said , " in the name of civilization , in behalf of endangered American interests , which give us the right and the duty to speak and act , the war in Cuba must stop . " On April 19 , the anniversary of Lexington , Congress passed a series of resolutions virtually declaring war on Spain , and hostilities began . The first blow was struck not in the West Indies , but on the opposite side of the world . At Hong-Kong was Commodore George Dewey , in command of a squadron of cruisers ? the Olympia , the Boston , the Raleigh , the Concord , and the Petrel . On April 22 he was joined by the cruiser Baltimore , and soon after he received orders to proceed to the Philippine Islands to destroy the Spanish fleet there . On April 27 he set sail for the Island of Luzon , 628 miles away . Three days later low-lying hills covered with tropical verdure were sighted , and while the last preparations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay . On the evening of April 30 Dewey approached the entrance to the bay , and with all lights out sailed boldly in . During the early morning hours he moved to a position opposite the sea walls of Manila , and then , making a great loop , steamed past the arsenal of Cavite . Here Admiral Montojo awaited the attack with his squadron of seven vessels . As the gray American fighters approached , two submarine mines were exploded just ahead of the Olympia . They hurled water high in the air , but did no harm . Dewey did not falter . The guns at Cavite and on the Spanish fleet opened fire , and shells began to burst over the Americans and in the water around them . On board the Olympia all was silence save the whir of the blowers and the throb of the engines . The men stood at their posts in the intense heat , stripped to the waist . Then suddenly arose the cry : " Remember the Maine ! " Dewey saw that the moment for action had come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said to the captain of the Olympia . An eight-inch gun in the forward turret roared forth , followed by barks from the Baltimore and the Boston . At 4,000 yards came the order , " Open all guns ! " and a storm of shells began to fall upon the doomed Spanish vessels . Five times the American cruisers moved past Cavite , each time drawing closer , each time dealing greater havoc among the enemy . Flames burst from some of the Spanish cruisers . The Reina Cristina keeled over until her bulwarks were awash . The Don Antonio de Ulloa was still making a gallant fight , but the American vessels now concentrated their fire upon her , and in a few moments she too went down . At halfpast twelve the red-and-yellow flag of Spain was lowered from the staff over Cavite and Dewey was master of Manila Bay . This victory had been won without serious injury to any of the American ships , with not a man killed and with but seven wounded . The world was astonished . The Spaniards were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Germans , who resented the intrusion of the United States in the Far East , hinted broadly at intervention . Admiral Von I ) it ? +1e ? - ricks , who commanded the German Asiatic squadron , sailed into Manila Bay , and did all in his power to annoy Dewey and encourage the Spaniards . Not until 15,000 American soldiers had arrived , and the Stars and Stripes had been raised over the plaza at Manila , could Dewey be sure that Von Diedericks would not attack him . In the meanwhile , four great war-vessels , the pride of the Spanish navy , were steaming across the Atlantic for the West Indies . The government at Madrid realized that Spain must stake all upon a naval engagement , for without control of the water Cuba would fall an easy prey to the American land forces . But prudence dictated that this battle should be fought only after the fleet had arrived at one of the West Indian ports , and had been overhauled . For the Americans the obvious policy was to strike at once , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Admiral Sampson , with the New York , the Iowa , and the Indiana , watched off the coast of Porto Rico , while Admiral Schley , with the Brooklyn , the Massachusetts , and the Texas , guarded the southern ports of Cuba . But Cervera gave them both the slip , and on May 19 entered the harbor of Santiago unobserved by the Americans . A few days later the lead-colored war-vessels of Schley and Sampson appeared off the harbor 's mouth , and the Spaniards were bottled up . With the way cleared for the landing of troops , regiment after regiment was despatched to Tampa , there to take transport for Cuba . There was much delay , much red tape , much confusion , not a little inefficiency . Heavy woollen clothes were provided for this campaign in the tropics , the transports were jammed to suffocation , a general was selected who was incapacitated for active work in the field by ill health and corpulency . These handicaps were offset by the gallantry of the soldiers themselves . When once they had set foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungles , past tangled wire , over fortified posts , until they had planted the Stars and Stripes on the hills above Santiago . Cervera had to run the gauntlet of Sampson 's fleet , or be battered to pieces by the guns of the American army . Sunday , July 3 , 1898 , found the American fleet grouped around the entrance to Santiago harbor , patiently waiting for the enemy to come out . The day was unusually clear , and the men in the watch-towers could easily distinguish the Spanish blockhouses in the distant blue mountains . Suddenly their attention was caught by several columns of black smoke arising over the Moro promontory , and a moment later the Maria Teresa came into view , followed by the Vizcaya , the Cristobal Colon , the Oquenda , and two destroyers . The great cruisers swept majestically out of the harbor , their red and yellow ensigns standing out against the dark-green background of the Cuban hills , their black prows piling uu the white waves on either side . On board the American vessels the alarm gongs sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry went up : " There they come ! There they come ! " A terrific fire was concentrated on the leading Spanish ships . As they turned westward along the coast , shells burst around them . Then a panoply of smoke settled over each of the ships , through which the flashes of the guns glared red . When the breeze blew the smoke away , the Maria Teresa was heading for shore , smoke and flames pouring from her upper works . A few minutes later this proud vessel , Cervera 's flagship , was aground on the Cuban shore , a hopeless wreck . The Oregon , the Texas , and the Indiana now turned their attention to the Oquenda , and this cruiser , after turning in shore , blew up , scattering a shower of steel splinters around her . The Vizcaya labored on for another forty minutes , but in the end she too made for the beach , her decks a mass of flames . The Colon was now tearing along six miles ahead , and for a while it seemed that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Texas gave chase . Inch by inch they overhauled her . At fifteen minutes past one the Colon lowered her colors , and the battle of Santiago was over . The Spanish fleet had been annihilated . More than 350 Spaniards were killed or drowned in the tangled wreckage , 160 were wounded , and 1,750 taken . As the Texas , the Oregon , and the Brooklyn lay with engines stopped , off Rio Tarquino , in a semicircle around the l'ulon , // cheers went up from the American crews and came echoing back from the mountains . From the Oregon could be heard the strains of " The Star-Spangled Banner . " The Brooklyn cheered the Texas , the Texas cheered the Brooklyn , and both cheered for the Oregon . On board the Texas the officers , with but one exception , were jubilant and hilarious . That exception was Captain John W. Philip . It had been noticed that he seemed unusually reserved and silent . Suddenly he turned to his executive officer , saying : " Call all hands aft . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackened with smoke and powder , trooped to the quarter-deck , and stood facing their gallant commander . " I want all of you , " he said , " officers and crew , unless there be those who have conscientious scruples against so doing , to lift your hats and in your hearts to offer silent thanks to God . " For a moment every man stood reverently , with bowed head , many with moistened eyes , and then three hearty cheers went up for Captain Philip . The Spanish cause was now hopeless . With Sampson 's warships in command of the sea , Spain could neither reinforce her armies in Cuba nor prevent the landing of American troops . On July 22 Madrid asked for terms , and a few weeks later a cessation of hostilities was proclaimed . The treaty of peace was signed December 10 , 1898 . Spain relinquished sovereignty over Cuba and ceded to the United States the Philippines , Porto Rico , and Guam , while the United States paid $20,000 , - 000 for the Philippines , and assumed the claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , as the imperial experiment of Spain in America came to a close , an experiment which had lasted four centuries , the great republic of the West began an imperial experiment of its own . We acquired nearly a million subjects of Spanish and negro blood in Porto Rico , and became responsible for 7,500 , - 000 people in the Philippines , ranging from the cultured Tagalogs of Manila to the head-hunting Igorrotes . There were many who doubted the wisdom of this step . Was it not contrary to the traditional policy of the nation ? they asked . Could the American people retain their own liberties while holding other peoples in subjection ? Our democratic institutions were threatened by the trusts ; now the war with Spain was to bring the still greater menace of imperialism . The Democratic party , in the election of 1900 , made opposition to the new colonial policy the chief plank in their platform . Whether or not these fears were groundless , imperialism brought , the United States athwart the colonial ambitions of certain European powers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a jealous eye at the spread of American influence in the Far East and in the West Indies . Her hostility to the Monroe Doctrine , long nourished in secret , became more outspoken . The rule which Uncle Sam lays down for others he will not follow himself , complained the German leaders . While excluding European powers from American soil , he does not scruple to assume sovereignty over Latin-American territory . The Kaiser made up his mind that at the first opportunity he would get a foothold in the Western Hemisphere . This opportunity was not long in coming . At the opening of the new century the finances of Venezuela became so involved that the republic could no longer meet its obligations to foreign powers . This gave the Kaiser a pretext for interfering , and in 190 ' 2 he induced Great Britain and Italy to join him in a " pacific blockade " of the Venezuelan coast . The United States took no notice of this step until President Roosevelt discovered " that Germany intended to seize some Venezuelan harbor and turn it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kiao-chau , with a view to exercising some control over the future isthmian canal , and over South American affairs generally . " He at once urged Germany to settle her difficulties by arbitration . But the Kaiser would neither arbitrate nor give a satisfactory guarantee not to seize Venezuelan territory . Thereupon Roosevelt assembled the American battle fleet at Culebra , Porto Rico , and ordered Admiral Dewey to put the vessels in fighting trim , ready to sail at an hour 's notice . He then sent for Herr von Holleben , the German Ambassador , and asked him to inform his government that , if no notification for arbitration came within ten days , he would order Dewey 's fleet to Venezuela to prevent the seizure of territory . Von Holleben thought the President was bluffing , and apparently so advised the Kaiser . A week later he called again at the White House , but failed even to mention Venezuela . As he arose to go , Roosevelt asked him whether he had received an answer to his request for arbitration . The Ambassador said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that event , " said the President , " it is useless to wait so long as I had intended , and I shall order Dewey to sail twenty-four hours in advance of the date originally set . " Not a little alarmed , von Holleben consulted Doctor Buenz , the German consul-general at New York , a man thoroughly acquainted with the United States and a personal friend of the President . Buenz convinced him that Roosevelt meant what he said , and a few minutes later a message was on its way over the wires to Berlin that Germany must back down or fight the United States . Within thirty-six hours word came from the German embassy to the President that Kaiser Wilhelm was willing to arbitrate . It was a bitter humiliation for the proud Hohenzollern . Von Holleben at once left for Germany in such disgrace with his master that not a member of the German diplomatic corps dared to see him off . Roosevelt , with an ironic touch of humor , publicly complimented the Kaiser on being a stanch advocate of arbitration , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that the Venezuelan affair had so nearly involved them in war . The Spanish-American War and the resulting acquisition of far-flung possessions aroused the country to the necessity of constructing a canal through Panama or Nicaragua . With the main body of the fleet stationed in the Atlantic , an attack upon the Philippines might succeed before the ships could steam 14,000 miles around Cape Horn to Hawaii , and then 4,800 more to Manila . During the war the battleship Oregon had made the voyage from San Francisco to the West Indies to join Sampson 's squadron , but this feat only emphasized the gulf which lay between the Atlantic and Pacific fleets . The canal , so long dreamed of , had now become a necessity . It would cut down the sea voyage from New York to San Fran- cisco to 5,219 miles , and make it possible for the fleets to concentrate in less than two weeks , off either the eastern or the western coast . The commercial advantages would also be great . It would multiply the traffic from the Atlantic and Gulf ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to Peru and Chile . President Roosevelt entered into the project with zeal , and in November , 1901 , the chief international difficulty was removed by the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty . Under its provisions Great Britain renounced her claims to control jointly with the United States any isthmian canal which might be constructed , and gave us the right , on our own initiative , to dig , manage , and fortify it . Seven months later Congress passed an act empowering the President to purchase the unfinished De Lesseps Canal at Panama for not more than $40,000,000 , and to acquire from the Republic of Colombia a strip of land across the isthmus . Accordingly Secretary 1-lay negotiated a treaty with the Colombian charge d'affaires at Washington which granted the United States a ninety-nine year lease of a canal zone , in return for $10,000,000 in cash and an annual rental of $250,000 . Unfortunately , the Congress of Colombia , by a unanimous vote , refused to sanction the agreement . President Roosevelt was angered at this unexpected repulse . He believed that Colombia meant to postpone final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then claim the $40,000,000 which the United States had offered for the French rights . He favored going ahead , " without further dealing with the foolish and homicidal corruptionists at Bogota . " The way was prepared by a revolution in Panama . The people of the isthmus felt that Colombia , which had long ruled them despotically , was now sacrificing their most vital interests . On November 3 , 1903 , under the leadership of Senor Arango and Doctor Amador , they rose in revolt , organized a provisional government , and proclaimed the independence of the Republic of Panama . A small body of Colombian troops at Colon made several ineffectual efforts to reach the town of Panama , where the insurrection was in progress , and t lien sailed away , leaving the rebels in possession of the country . The United States promptly recognized the new republic , and on November 18 concluded with it a new canal treaty . Panama granted for our perpetual use a zone of land ten miles wide , receiving in return a guarantee of independence , $10,000,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work was begun at once . In November , 1906 , when President Roosevelt visited Panama , he found the digging going on vigorously . Mr. Roosevelt saw the drills pounding away at the rock ; the great steam-shovels devouring the masses of stone and earth ; gangs of Jamaican negroes singing at their work or shouting excitedly as a cliff gave way before a mighty blast ; he visited the neat little villages built for the workmen ; inspected hospitals , commissary stores , bath-houses , cook-sheds , machine-shops ; marvelled at the progress made in eliminating the mosquito and freeing the zone of malaria and yellow fever ; praised the engineers for securing a supply of excellent drinking-water ; listened to the plans for huge dams and locks . Eight years later the Ancon , a 10,000-ton steamer , entered the towering Gatun locks . The electric locomotives deftly moved her into place , and the great gates , weighing hundreds of tons , swung behind her , their ends meeting with the exactness of a micrometer . Then up the vessel went , eighty-five feet through the triple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A beautiful body of water it was , this great artificial lake , dotted with charming little islands and framed by the restful green hills . The ship went on past the tops of dying trees , to where the lake narrowed into the Chagres River , into the hand-made gorge of Culebra , where Gold Hill and her sister peak towered hundreds of feet above the canal , past the dangerous Cucaracha slide , out into the charming little Miraflores Lake , set in rolling hills covered with tropical verdure , then through the Pedro Miguel and Miraflores locks , out into the waters of the Pacific . It was the first voyage through the Panama Canal from ocean to ocean . The dream of Balboa for a water passage between the Atlantic and Pacific had at last been realized . WRILE the attention of the nation was still fixed upon foreign affairs and the acquisition of colonies , a strong movement had begun for internal reform . Many thoughtful men lamented the fact that in practice democracy did not mean literally the rule of the people . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because our form of government was democratic , it was therefore automatically producing democratic results , " said Robert M. La Follette . So there arose a demand for a more direct democracy , for the rule of the people without the intervention of political " middlemen . " The ideals of Jefferson have by no means been attained , it was said . The conventions which nominate our public officers are controlled by corrupt politicians , our legislatures have fallen under the power of big business , our cities are run by unscrupulous bosses . Let us shake off the incubus of machine politics , so that our institutions can serve the purpose for which they were created . If the old machinery of government does not function properly , we must devise new machinery which will serve the needs of the people . In this spirit the people of many States adopted a device for direct government known as the initiative and referendum . The initiative authorized a certain per cent of the voters to place a measure upon the ballot to be voted upon either by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligatory for the legislature , upon the petition of a group of voters , to submit any of its laws to the people for their veto or their sanction . Hand in hand with these radical reforms went the demand for the recall by popular vote of public officers , for the election of Senators by direct popular vote , for nominations by primaries , for the short ballot , and for the commission government of cities . The reform movement received impetus from the renewed // outcry against big business and the unequal distribution of wealth . The Socialists denounced the control of industry , transportation , land , and credit by great aggregations of capital , and demanded government ownership of railways , mines , mills , banks , and public utilities . More conservative groups believed that the extremely high tariff was chiefly responsible for the evils of the day , and insisted upon downward revision . Some thought that much could be accomplished by more stringent laws for the control of the trusts . Thus on all sides there was unrest , on all sides a demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles exposing the corruption and incompetence of public officials . Everywhere people said that democracy was once more on trial , everywhere the question was asked : " Shall the people rule ? " At this moment fate placed in the Presidency a man constitutionally unfitted to take the lead in radical reform . William H. Taft , whom the Republicans nominated and elected in 1908 , was an able administrator , a jurist of distinction , and a man of winning personality . But he was too conservative to satisfy the demands for radical changes . He feared to apply the knife for fear of cutting sound tissue . His term was by no means devoid of progressive measures , for he was sponsor for the prosecution of trusts , for railway regulation , for the extension of the civil service , for the establishing of postal savings banks , the parcel post , a commerce court , and an expert tariff board . But he moved too slowly and soon found himself out of step with the reformers . The outstanding " crime " of the Taft administration was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1908 had promised a " genuine and honest revision " of the tariff . When Congress convened in March , 1909 , in extra session , Sereno E. Payne , of New York , introduced a bill extending the free list , and making many substantial reductions . But when it came to the Senate Finance Committee , that body , under the leadership of Nelson W. Aldrich , mutilated the measure by making wholesale increases . The House protested against this breach of the party pledge , but in the end it was forced to yield . President Taft affixed his signature August 5. // A burst of indignation followed . Once more our representatives have betrayed us , . t was said . Once more the corrupt alliance of big business and the politicians has defeated the people 's will . It is " the most outrageous assault of privileged interests on the people in tariff history , " said one progressive Senator . A humorous writer on public affairs ridiculed it for placing on the free list such " necessities of life " as " curlingstones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When Taft defended the law as " the best tariff ever passed by , the Republican party , " the reformers turned against him as a hopeless reactionary . There is no hope for the country , they said , so long as this " stand-patter " remains in the White House . A group of progressive Republicans , led by La Follette , believing that they had come to the parting of the ways , called a meeting in Washington for January 21 , 1911 , to form a National Progressive Republican League . They adopted a declaration of principles , which lamented that " popular government in America has been thwarted and progressive legislation strangled by the special interests , which control caucuses , delegates , conventions , and party organizations , and through this control of the machinery of government dictate nominations and platforms . " It declared in favor of direct election of Senators , direct primaries , and the initiative , referendum , and recall . The League disclaimed any intention of seceding from the Republican party , but its very existence testified to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open breach . The crisis came with the Republican convention of 1912 . Roosevelt was the choice of the progressive wing of the party ; the conservatives remained faithful to Taft . Thirteen States had adopted the system of preferential primaries and in each of these now was fought a hot pre-convention fight for delegates . The result was a great victory for Roosevelt . Of the 382 delegates named by these primaries , he received 278 . But in those States where delegates were chosen by the convention method , Taft was still strong . Moreover , the nat Tonal committee , which was authorized to make up the temporary roll of the convention , was filled with his partisans . " We , rari't // elect Taft , " one of the members stated , " but we are going to hold onto this organization , and when we get back four years from now we will have it , and not those damn insurgents . " Of 254 disputed seats which came before the committee , 235 were awarded to Taft men . Before they had completed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and his supporters either left the hall or refrained from further participation . On the first ballot Taft received 561 votes , and was declared the nominee . Three days after the Republican convention had adjourned , the Democrats met at Baltimore . Their hopes were high , for the dissensions of the Republicans made victory reasonably certain . But in their ranks , too , there was a sharp line of cleavage between progressives and conservatives . When the bosses nominated Judge Alton B. Parker for the temporary chairmanship , they encountered the powerful opposition of William J. Bryan . Bryan , who was still regarded by thousands as the champion of the plain people , appealed to the leading candidates to oppose this choice . When Woodrow Wilson alone frankly and cordially acceded , he at once became the candidate of Bryan and the progressives . Bryan next startled the country by offering a resolution declaring the convention opposed to any candidate " who is the representative of or under obligations to J. Pierpont Morgan , Thomas F. Ryan , August Belmont , or any other member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which followed he said : " Extraordinary conditions need extraordinary remedies . . . . There is not a delegate who does not know that an effort is being made right now to sell the Democratic party into bondage to the predatory interests of the country . It is the most brazen , the most impudent attempt that has been made in the history of American politics to dominate a convention , stifle the honest sentiment of a people , and make the nominee the bond-slave of the men who exploit this country . " There were 1,088 delegates in the convention , and under the two-thirds rule 726 votes were necessary to a choice . On the first ballot Champ Clark , of Missouri , received 440% , Wilson 324 , and all other candidates 323% . On the tenth ballot the New York delegation went over to Clark , and it seemed that his nomination was inevitable . But Bryan transferred the Nebraska delegation to Wilson , while his henchmen in all parts of the country sent telegrams , threatening , urging , imploring their representatives to support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept ahead , until , on the forty-sixth ballot , he was nominated . The progressive element , which was defeated in the Republican convention , had conquered in the Democratic . The meeting of the Progressives , at Chicago , on August 5 , was more like " a family reunion or a great religious revival meeting than a political convention . " As the two thousand delegates shouted and stamped , or sang the " Battle Hymn of the Republic " they seemed to be fired with the crusader 's zeal . When Roosevelt appeared he was greeted by a tremendous ovation . At the conclusion of a stirring address , in which he called upon the delegates to gird themselves " for this great fight in the never-ending warfare for the good of mankind , " he was nominated by acclamation . The party platform declared that behind the ostensible government sat an invisible government , owing no allegiance and alleging no responsibility to the people .

The Democrats secured control of both branches of Congress , the Senate by the narrow margin of 6 seats , and the House by the majority of 291 to 144. - Woodrow Wilson approached the Presidency in the spirit of the reformer . " This is not a day of triumph , " he said in his inaugural address , " it is a day of dedication . Here muster not the forces of party , but the forces of humanity .

I summon all honest men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God helping me , I will not fail them if they will but counsel and sustain me . " Congress met in extra session on April 7 , 1913 , and proceeded without delay to the consideration of tariff revision . Oscar Underwood introduced a bill which called for the removing of duties on foodstuffs and raw materials , for a reduction on metals , cottons , and woollens , for the heavy taxation of luxuries , and for a graduated income tax . It passed the House promptly , by a vote of ' 281 to 139 . But when it came to the Senate it encountered the opposition of certain threatened interests ? the sugar-growers of Louisiana , the iron manufacturers of Alabama , the cotton manufacturers of Georgia . Some of the Southern Senators yielded to this pressure , and it seemed that the bill would suffer the fate of the tariff of 1894 . The nation looked on anxiously , wondering whether Wilson could close the breach in the party ranks . It had not long to wait . The President issued a startling statement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was trying to mutilate the bill . This vigorous action drove some of the wavering Senators back into line , and the bill , essentially unchanged , passed 44 to 37 . The battle which had been opened by Cleveland in 1887 now , after the lapse of a quarter of a century , had been brought to a victorious conclusion . On June 23 , 1913 , the President came before Congress to urge the necessity of a new banking and currency system . " We must have a currency not rigid as now , " he said , " but readily , elastically responsive to credit . . . . Our banking laws must mobilize reserves , must not permit the concentration anywhere in a few hands of the monetary resources of the country . . . . And the control of the new system of banking must be vested in the government itself , so that the banks may be the instruments , not the masters , of business . " A monetary committee had been at work since 1908 studying the banking and currency systems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for vital changes . A bank bill , shaped by the President , Secretary McAdoo , Senator Owen , and Representative Glass , in consultation with Paul M. Warburg , was introduced in Congress on June 26 , 1913 . It called for a Federal Reserve Bank system , which divided the country into twelve districts , with a central bank in each . Private banks might enter the system on terms prescribed by the bill . At the head of the system was to be a Federal Reserve Board , consisting of the Secretary of the Treasury , the Comptroller of the Currency , and five other members . The struggle over this far-reaching measure was long and bitter , but in the end Wilson 's masterful leadership beat down the opposition , and in December it became law . The conclusion of , 1 , he first year of Wilson 's administration found the President victorious , exulting in his accomplishment , confident of the future . He had fulfilled his pledge to the American people , he had delivered powerful blows at " intrenched privilege , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In twelve months he had carried through liberal legislation which the people for years had demanded in vain . A new era of prosperity and progress seemed to open before the nation . But at this juncture an event occurred in Europe which was to divert the attention of the people from internal affairs and involve the country in hitherto undreamed-of problems and perils . This event was the outbreak of the World War . UROPE , in the early years of the twentieth century , was J ripe for war . On all sides were hatred and fear , conflicting claims for territory , commercial rivalries , racial antipathies , and long-nurtured ambitions . Italy , Serbia , and Rumania wished to " redeem " their lost nationals ; France waited for an opportunity to regain Alsace-Lorraine ; Russia guarded jealously her influence in the Balkans ; Germany dreamed of conquering her " place in the sun " ; Austria-Hungary looked with suspicion upon the national ambitions of her smaller neighbors . Every frontier bristled with forts ; the people staggered under the burden of military and naval armaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy were aligned on one side , and Russia , France , and Great Britain on the other . Although many leading statesmen . spoke hopefully of peace , and boasted of international good-will , of " frankness and fair concession , " it was obvious that war clouds were gathering over Europe . On June 8 , 1914 , the Archduke Francis Ferdinand , heir presumptive to the Hapsburg realm , paid a visit to Sarajevo , capital of Bosnia . The little city presented a picturesque appearance , with its stately buildings , oriental bazaar , mosques , slender minarets , attractive streets , many bridges , its interesting blending of Eastern and Western civilizations . After a celebration in the town hall , the Archduke , with his wife , the Countess of Hohenberg , entered an automobile and drove along Appel Quay . At the corner of the Franz-Josefsgasse , where the street narrows , a man rushed forward and fired at the royal guests . Without a word the Duchess fell across her husband 's knee , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . The automobile sped on to the palace , where both victims expired without regaining consciousness . Thus did Gavrilo Prinzip ignite the mine which set the world on fire . // For some weeks there was an ominous calm . Then came an ultimatum from Austria-Hungary to Serbia , practically indicting the Serbian nation for complicity in the murder , making demands which could be acceded to only by compromising Serbian honor and independence , and requiring an answer within forty-eight hours . This imperilled Russian interests in the Near East , and threatened . to involve the Triple Entente in war with the Triple Alliance . For two weeks Sir Edward Grey and other statesmen made frantic but vain efforts to ward off the impending catastrophe . Soon Europe was resounding to the tread of countless hosts . The World War had begun . On these unexpected happenings the American people looked with amazement . They regarded themselves as distant spectators of a terrible phenomenon . That their own country would be drawn into the struggle at first occurred to no one . It had been our traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined by Washington , strengthened by the Monroe Doctrine and crystallized by time . Seven days after Austria-Hungary had declared war on Serbia , President Wilson issued a proclamation of American neutrality . On August 18 he appealed to the people for a spirit of impartiality to all belligerents . " I venture . . to speak a solemn word of warning to you , " he said , " against that depest , most subtle , most essential breach of neutrality which may spring out of passionately taking sides . " This appeal proved futile . The action of Germany in invading Belgium in order to strike an unprotected part of the French frontier , the belief that the Central Powers had been the aggressors , together with a feeling of kinship with Great Britain and France , conspired to create sympathy with the Entente Allies . Moreover , Americans were concerned at the possibility that , in place of the time-honored balance of power , there might arise in Europe a vast military empire under the leadership of the Kaiser . This would endanger not only the Monroe Doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States . This feeling of suspicion grew into anger when German submarines began en442 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE dangering the lives of neutrals by sinking merchant vessels on the high seas . On the afternoon of May 7 , 1915 , the great ocean liner Lusitania was steaming off the south coast of Ireland through placid sunlit seas . Many of the passengers were at luncheon , expecting an early termination of their journey and apprehensive of no imminent danger . Suddenly came a muffled drumlike explosion , followed by a shivering or trembling of the vessel . Instantly the word went round that a German torpedo had found its mark . There was no panic . The passengers quietly assembled on deck , while the crew attempted to lower the lifeboats . But the liner was already listing sharply to starboard , and in twenty minutes she gently dipped her bow and began to sink . From her crowded decks came one long , despairing , mournful cry , and a moment later she had disappeared under the water . The fishing-boats and tugs which hastened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreckage , some desperately injured , all chilled and exhausted . They were taken ashore and tenderly cared for . The hearts of the kindly Irish people were torn at the scenes enacted around them ? of distraught mothers seeking their children , wives looking for husbands , children for their parents . When word arrived that a little boy or girl had been taken to this house or that , now and then some mother would rush up , asking : " Is it my boy ? " or " Is it my little girl ? " Over 1,500 persons perished on the Lusitania , among them 114 Americans . A cry of horror went up from the United States . Are we to sit with folded hands , it was asked , while the Germans send unoffending Americans to their death ? Enormous pressure was brought to bear upon the President to demand prompt reparation . Mr. Wilson , like Thomas Jefferson after the Chesapeake-Leopard affair , for the moment held in his hand the option of peace or war . But , like Jefferson , he was unwilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to divert the country from its policy of peace . A long interchange of notes followed between Washington and Berlin , in which the President tried to wring from the // German Government a promise not to sink ocean liners without giving crews and passengers an opportunity to escape . " The Government of the United States is contending for something much greater than mere rights of property or privileges of commerce , " wrote Secretary Lansing . " It is contending for nothing less high and sacred than the rights of humanity . " Germany parried , but in a note of July 21 , 1915 , President Wilson made it obvious that evasion of the main issue would no longer be tolerated . If the commanders of German naval vessels continued to contravene the rights of American citizens , he said , the Government of the United States would re-gard their action as deliberately unfriendly . On September 1 Ambassador Von Bernstorff sent Secretary Lansing a note promising that " liners will not be sunk by our submarines without warning and without safety to the lives of non-combatants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance . " The favorable impression created in America by this promise was largely nullified by secret acts of hostility on the part of the German Government . The German embassy at Washington employed agents to foment strikes , to blow up bridges and munition factories , and to place bombs in the holds of vessels bound for England or France . The climax of this hostile intrigue was reached in January , 1917 , when a German plot to embroil the United States in war with Mexico and Japan was detected and made public . Foreign Minister Zimmerman sent instructions to the Minister at Mexico City to propose to the Mexican Government an alliance on the following basis : " That we shall make war together and together make peace . We shall give general financial support , and it is understood that Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory of New Mexico , Texas , and Arizona . " The Minister was also to suggest that the President of Mexico propose an alliance with Japan and offer to mediate between Japan and Germany . While the country was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government had given notice of its intention to resume the unrestricted submarine campaign . The Kaiser and his advisers had convinced themselves that by an // intensive campaign against Allied shipping they could , in six months ' time , starve Great Britain into submission . The withdrawal of Great Britain would give Germany undisputed supremacy over the remaining Allies both on land and sea , and force them to make peace on Germany 's terms . It was hoped that the United States would still remain neutral , but should she enter the war the German leaders were confident that all would be over before she could make her weight felt . Therefore they notified President Wilson that after February 1 , 1917 , they would prevent all navigation in a zone around Great Britain , France , and Italy , by sinking merchant vessels without warning , and without safeguarding the lives of passengers and crews . Two days later the President announced to Congress that diplomatic relations with Germany had been severed . War followed two months later , after news had reached the Government that submarines had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois , and several other American merchant ships . On the evening of April 2 a notable assemblage gathered in the Hall of Representatives . Directly in front of the Speaker 's desk sat the members of the Supreme Court , at one side were many foreign diplomats , behind on the floor were Senators and Congressmen , while the gallery was crowded with distinguished guests . At half-past eight the Speaker rose , announcing simply : " The President of the United States . " As Mr. Wilson entered and took his place on the Speaker 's platform , the assemblage sprang to their feet and burst into prolonged cheering . When Speaker Clark had rapped for order , the President advanced to the clerk 's desk , and , resting both arms on the green baize , began to read in a quiet , even voice . " I have called the Congress into extraordinary session , because there are serious , very serious choices of policy to be made , and made immediately . . . . The new German policy has swept every restriction aside . Vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their cargo , their destination , their errand , have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board . . . . American ships have been sunk , American lives // taken , in ways which it has stirred us very deeply to learn of , but the ships and people of other neutral and friendly nations have been sunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way . There has been no discrimination . The challenge is to all mankind . Each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it . . . . ( But ) there is one choice we can not make , we are incapable of making ; we will not choose the path of submission . . . . " Before the President could finish , the venerable Chief Justice White dropped his big soft hat , and , springing to his feet , raised his hands and brought them together with a bang . It was the signal for a tremendous demonstration . The cheers were not the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a victorious army , but the deep , intense cheers of men who were fired with unswerving determination . When all had resumed their seats , the President continued . " We will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated . . . . With a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step I am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it involves , but in unhesitating obedience to what I deem my constitutional duty , I advise that the Congress declare the recent course of the Imperial German Government to be in fact nothing less than war against the Government and people of the United States ; that it formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon it ; and that it take immediate steps not only to put the country in a more thorough . state of defense , but also to exert all its power and employ all its resources to bring the Government of the German Empire to terms and end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 , 1917 , Congress passed a resolution declaring that war existed between Germany and the United States . The German leaders blundered badly when they provoked the American people to war . The unrestricted submarine eainpaign , while inflicting severe losses upon the Allies , did not force Great Britain to sue for peace . At the same time , in 1917 , Russia fell into the hands of the Bolsheviki , who signed a treaty of peace with Germany at Brest-Litovsk , thus din limit - // ing the great eastern front . With large masses of troops released for service in the west , the Germans might have crushed the British and French armies , had it not been for the timely aid of the United States . In the closing days of April a war council met at Washington , in which Arthur J. Balfour , M. Viviani , Marshal Joffre , and other British and French leaders pointed out to the American Government how best it could make its weight felt in the war . " Our most pressing need is for money , " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial drain of the war ; next in order let us have food , especially sugar , wheat , and fats , else a lack of proper nourishment may lower the efficiency of our fighters and our workers ; then we would have you aid in combating the submarines , not only by sending your navy to European waters , but by building merchant vessels ; and , lastly , you must brace the morale of our forces , by sending some troops to the western front . " It was a gigantic task to mobilize this great peace-loving nation for the purposes of war . But the government entered upon the task with an energy which boded ill for Germany and her allies . Under the leadership of Herbert C. Hoover , the production of foodstuffs was stimulated , consumption and waste cut down , and the exports of breadstuffs , meats , fats , and sugar to our Allies increased ; the Shipping Board drew up plans for a new merchant fleet to offset the depredations of the submarines ; the navy was set to work patrolling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and from Europe ; capital and labor were diverted from peaceful channels into the manufacture of shells , rifles , guns , military airplanes , tanks , and other war material ; billions of dollars ' worth of bonds were sold , so that credit could be extended to Great Britain , France , Italy , and Belgium ; an army numbering eventually 4,000,000 was put in the field . The American people responded nobly to the call of their leaders . Thousands of small gardens were planted , special efforts were made to preserve food by canning , and millions of households voluntarily cut down their consumption of sugar and fats . " Food will win the war " became a national slogan . // Congress passed an act placing the entire manhood of the nation at the disposal of the government . Those who were best fitted for the army were selected for the firing line ; those who were engaged in essential industries , or were otherwise responding to the needs of the war , were exempted from active service . " The whole nation must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which each man shall play the part for which he is best fitted . " On June 5 , 1917 , 9,700,000 men between the ages of twenty-one and thirty years inclusive , from every community in the country , came to their nearest voting-places and registered . From these , during the next month , the first draft of about 685,000 was made . Soon after the United States entered the war General John J. Pershing was appointed commander-in-chief of the American forces in Europe , and on May 28 he sailed for France with a staff of fifty-three officers . Sixteen days later he landed at Boulogne . It was a bright , sunny day , and the scene at the harbor was one of striking beauty . War-vessels and merchant craft alike were gay with bunting , crowds of citizens and soldiers lined the quays , while from every housetop floated the Stars and Stripes . As the steamer neared the landing , Pershing 's figure stood out prominently from the centre of his staff . A martial figure it was , which reflected force , energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of America . As they raised their voices in one mighty shout they saw , in the person of this unassuming general , the future American army , millions strong , which was coming to carry the war on to victory . Pershing stepped ashore and was greeted by General Dumas , commander of the northern region . " I salute the United States of America , " he said , " which has now become united to the United States of Europe . " It was the first time in history that a soldier wearing the American uniform had landed on the continent of Europe for the purpose of engaging in war . Drawn up on the quay was a detachment of French infantry in battle uniform , middle-aged men most of them , just f nu m the trenches . As the American general strode past and they came to salute with bodies erect , their faces betrayed their // eager joy . Forgotten was the submarine menace , the long years of bitter struggle , the suffering and hardship . Here was America to help them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months passed it became evident that the Allies could not win without the aid of a great American army . In July , 1917 , General Pershing wrote that " plans should contemplate sending over at least 1,000,000 men by next May , " while he advised for the future the creation of a force of not less than 3,000,000 . It was a stupendous task to create a vast army , transport it across the Atlantic , and maintain it in France . When war was declared , the total forces of the United States , including regular army , national guard , and reserves , amounted to hardly more than 300,000 officers and men . From a military point of view the country was ranked below Belgium . But the task was faced with characteristic energy . The General Staff was enlarged and its functions expanded ; schools were opened both in the United States and France to train officers ; the regular army was increased and organized into divisions ; the national guard was made the nucleus for a great federalized army ; a national army was created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arming , and caring for millions of men . In France the service of supply built great docks for the transports , repaired and maintained thousands of miles of roads , laid down 1,035 miles of railway ; constructed warehouses covering storage space of 500 acres , remount depots adequate for 39,000 animals , veterinary hospitals for 23,000 animals , mechanical bakeries capable of producing half a million pounds of bread a day , and 81 sawmills which turned out 218,000,000 feet of lumber , 4,000,000 railway ties , and vast quantities of fuel wood . The medical service , comprising 16,407 physicians , 8,593 nurses , and 126,231 soldiers , maintained 153 base hospitals , 66 camp hospitals , and 12 convalescent camps ? in all capable of caring for half a million patients . General Pershing chose as the American sector the region around Verdun and the St. Mihiel salient . This selection was determined by questions of communication and supply . The channel ports of France were crowded with shipping and supplies for the British army , while throughout the zone around // Paris every railway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Americans were compelled not only to bring their men and supplies over the Atlantic Ocean , but to transport them several hundred miles from Bordeaux , La Pallice , and St. Nazaire to the region of Chaumont and Barle-Due . The sector chosen by Pershing was a difficult field for offensive operations , for the ground was covered with forests and hills , and the German lines were many and powerful . But a successful advance here would cut the Coblenz-TrierMezieres railway , without which the German armies could not be maintained in France . General Pershing insisted upon training the American troops for open warfare . All through the winter of 1917-4918 he kept his regiments marching and drilling amid the snows and rains of northeastern France . Some of the Allied officers regarded these activities with good-humored condescension . Do the Americans not know that open warfare is a matter of the past ? they said . Let them train for the trenches , and there will be no need for exhausting manoeuvres of this kind . But Pershing was wiser than they . If ever we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued , must we not first force them into the open ? It is for that day that the Americans are preparing . A few months later , when the lines which had been rigid for three years suddenly began to give way , every officer in the Allied armies paid tribute to the foresight of the American general . In 1917 the Germans remained largely upon the defensive on the western front . They would not hazard their men in assaults upon the Allied lines , when they were confident that the submarines would bring the war to an end . But with the opening of 1918 it became obvious that the submarines had failed . The Allied countries were increasing their output of merchant vessels , the ocean channels were kept open , each month a larger number of submarines was sent to the bottom , and Great Britain was as far as ever from suing for peace . On the other hand , the Bolshevik revolution and the withdrawal of Russia from the war released many divisions for work in France .

Late in March he hurled against the British forty divisions on a front of forty miles . Favored by a heavy mist , the Germans broke the line and threatened to separate the British army from the French , capture the Channel ports , and drive the British out of France . When this offensive had been brought to a halt , a few miles east of Amiens , von Hindenburg launched another , equally fierce and unexpected , against the French between Soissons and Rheims . The French were swept from the famous Chemin des Dames , and before they could make a stand , a great salient had been made in the Allied line from the Aisne to the Marne . The outlook for France and her Allies seemed dark indeed . All eyes now turned anxiously upon the American troops . By the end of May there were eleven combat divisions in France , numbering about 300,000 men , while the transports were bringing in new detachments at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans fight ? was the question all Europe asked . With their imperfect training and their lack of experience , is it possible that they can hold their own against the veteran troops of Germany ? If so , the millions of men already in France or training in the United States will soon give Marshal Foch a great preponderance in numbers . The answer came from Cantigny . This little village , situated at the extreme tip of the Amiens salient , was selected as the place for testing the Americans . The First Division , commanded by General Robert L. Bullard , was brought to the sector and prepared for battle . On May 28 , at 6.45 in the morning , after an hour 's artillery preparation which annihilated the village , the men delivered a perfectly executed attack . Amid the roar of guns , the glare of flame-projectors , and the rumble of tanks , the men in khaki went forward and took the coveted positions . The Germans were deeply chagrined .
