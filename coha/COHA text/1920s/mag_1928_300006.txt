I ( name ) , now in the presence of Almighty God the Father , the Blessed Virgin Mary , the Blessed St. John the Baptist , the saints , sacred host of Heaven , to you my Ghostly Father , the superior general of the Society of Jesus , founded by St. Ignatius Loyola , in the pontification of Paul IV and continued to the present , do , by the womb of the Virgin , the matrix of God , and the rod of Jesus Christ , declare and swear that His Holiness the Pope is Christ 's vice-Regent and the true and only head of the Catholic or Universal Church throughout the earth , and that by virtue of the keys of binding and loosing given His Holiness by my Savior , Jesus Christ , he hath power to depose heretical kings , princes , states , commonwealths , and governments and they may be safely destroyed . . . . <P> " I do further promise and declare that I will have no opinion or will of my own or any mental reservation whatsoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhesitatingly obey each and every command that I may receive from my superiors in the militia of the Pope and Jesus Christ . . . . <P> " I do further promise and declare that I will , when opportunity presents , make and wage relentless war , secretly and openly , against all heretics , Protestants and Masons , as I am directed to extirpate them from the face of the whole earth . And that I will spare neither age , sex nor condition , and that I will hang , burn , waste , boil , flay , strangle , and bury alive these infamous heretics , rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women , and crush their infants ' heads against the walls in order to annihilate their execrable race . That when the same can not be done openly I will secretly use the poisonous cup , the strangulating cord , the steel of the poniard , regardless of the honor , rank , dignity or authority of the persons ... at any time I may be directed to do so by the agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knights of Columbus seem a mild and indeed a charitable organization . It will not therefore be easy for the average person to believe that the above great swear is the fourth degree oath of the Knights of Columbus . There are those , however , who know better , and who have spent thousands of dollars circulating copies of this oath among ignorant Protestants . Aware of this and aware also that the oath has never and will never be a part of its ritual , the Knights of Columbus , meeting in National Conference last week in Cleveland , promised to prosecute six unnamed organizations and persons , for disseminating the bogus information . <P> The authentic " fourth degree " oath is as follows : <P> I swear to support the Constitution of the United States . I pledge myself as a Catholic citizen and a Knight of Columbus to enlighten myself fully upon my duties as a citizen and to conscientiously perform such duties entirely in the interests of my country and regardless of all personal consequences . I pledge myself to do all in my power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote reverence and respect for law and order . I promise to practice my religion openly and consistently , but without ostentation , and to so conduct myself in public affairs , and in the exercise of public virtue as to reflect nothing but credit upon the Holy Church , to the end that she may flourish and our country prosper to the greater honor and glory of God .
