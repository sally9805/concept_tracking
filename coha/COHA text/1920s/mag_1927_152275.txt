" For an hour before the storm struck with lightning-like swiftness , a desultory thundershower had played about the western horizon . There were jagged flashes of lightning , almost incessant the continuous low rumble of thunder , interspersed with an ominous crackling and a gathering darkness . <P> " A tense silence , which made people 's ears ring , and a sense of oppression heralded the coming of the tornado . There was a dull drumming sound as of innumerable wings being flapped high in the air , and the swirl of black dust about the sky . Then a spiral of loosely woven clouds headed downward , an inky blackness in its wake , and the twister began its devastation . " <P> Such was one eyewitness ' description of what happened one noon last week when a low-pressure area formed in the sultry atmosphere over eastern Missouri , creating a Cave of the Winds , and loosing upon a residential section of St. Louis its worst tornado since 1896 . <P> It lasted only five minutes . But in that time , the swordlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six thickly populated square miles . School roofs flew . A home for crippled children and a whole street of modest dwellings were laid open like dolls ' houses , the walls being sucked off outwards by the tornadic vacuum . Steeples crashed , autos slid , trees swept by , scantlings whizzed , people who failed to lie prone were knocked so and dragged along . <P> Revised estimates of the death and damage : <P> 86 dead* <P> 1,152 injured badly enough to be hospitalized <P> $100,000,000 destroyed <P> 250 city blocks to be rebuilt <P> By order of President Coolidge , at the request of Missouri Governor Samuel A. Baker , relief work went forward speedily under Major General William Lassiter of the Sixth Army Corps Area ( Chicago ) . <P> <P> * In 1896 , 13 persons were killed in the St. Louis tornado , 1152 injured badly enough to be hospitalized , $100,000,000 destroyed . 250 city blocks to be rebuilt .
