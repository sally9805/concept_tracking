Except for the fact that it supplies in its commandments a code for clean living that has been paraphrased by many health departments , the Christian Church , founded upon a rock not to be shaken by the windy babbling of false prophets , has had little to do with the shifting frontiers , the deciduous dogmas , of modern medicine . Thinking always of the cures performed by a man of Galilee , it has held apart from the contentions of surgeons and physicians , to interest itself rather in the works of those faith healers who work without stethescopes or education , trying to restore the sick by a touch , telling the crippled to take up their beds and walk . <P> Nevertheless , faith healing has become so much the mode in Britain that last week the Archbishop of Canterbury appointed the Bishop of Southwark to preside over a council of six celebrated doctors and six clergymen to advise the Church " on all matters related to spiritual healing and healing missions . " In this step some people thought they perceived a formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for their opinions . <P> Said the Rev. Dr. Harold Anson , member of the Bishop of Oxford 's committee : " The duty of the permanent committee will be to advise the Church upon questions in which it should cooperate with the medical profession in regard to healing , and also upon those questions where morals and physical health are very closely related-for instance , birth control . <P> " They will also advise regarding the spiritual care of the insane and criminal . It will have the effect in the future , we hope , of helping all those trying to heal the sick through spiritual means to a higher level of thought and practice . " <P> Said the British Medical Association : " Our position is that , while not in the least desiring to hamper the Bishop of Southwark and those who will meet with him , we think the time has not yet arrived when we can speak authoritatively on behalf of the profession generally on the question of spiritual healing . <P> " There is , we feel , too much difference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to do so .
