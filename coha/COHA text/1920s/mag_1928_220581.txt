THE GREAT AMERICAN BAND WAGON - Charles Merz - John Day ( $3 ) . Everybody come quick , jump aboard , see a lotta things you never saw before , forget you 're a shoe clerk , play cowboy an ' injun , make yourself a hero , have secret power - everybody 's doing it , follow the crowd , you ca n't go wrong . <P> Thus , the spirit of contemporary U. S. , according to Author Merz . In the 18th and 19th Centuries , the changing frontier provided a healthy outlet for this up-and-going urge . But today the frontier has disappeared , the Indians are in sideshows or oil fields , the cowboys are in dude ranches or vaudeville . What does Mr. Average Citizen do to relieve his tension ? He goes exploring in his automobile , knowing perfectly well that he will see familiar filling stations , hot dogs , kewpie dolls , cigaret signboards , and a thousand explor ers who will say with him : " Well , the traffic sure is heavy " Perhaps he stalks into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rail , demands a **34;6869;TOOLONG sundae and a chicken-liver sandwich . Before supper he reads the fortnightly crime ofthe " crime of the century " in his favorite newspaper. * That the night , dressed in heroic robes , he enters the oaken door of a temple and becomes Sir Knight Errant of the Mystic Order of Granada . Sunday , on the golf links , he tells his companions : " I got a birdie here last week , " instead of the oldtime " I shot a buffalo here . " After his labors , he dreams over an advertisement : " To live at American Venice is to quaff the very Wine of Life . ... A turquoise lagoon under an aquamarine sky ! Lazy gondolas ! Beautiful Italian gardens ! . . . And , ever present , the waters of the Great South Bay lapping lazily all the day upon a beach as white and fine as the soul of a little child " Thus , the log cabin of the modern pioneer . <P> True enough , most of this has been noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-inclusive footnote on Babbittry , written with a reporter 's peculiar genius for marshalling an army of items into significant categories . It must be remembered , however , that a newer school of thought has evidence that Mr. Bab bitt laughs as heartily at his own humbug-Aeries and homilies as does the sophisticate . <P> Author Merz , 34 , Yale graduate , editorial writer for the New York World , contributor to magazines , has a little black mustache , a serious look . His book is the choice of the Literary Guild for February . <P> <P> * The infallible sign of a really great murder is the appearance of the Western Union Co. ' s giant portable electric switchboard , capable of despatching 20,000 words an hour over 180 wires . This behemoth is also used for such spectacles as Dempsey-Tunney fights , otherwise it sulks in storage .
