Scene . In the fastnesses of Tennessee , the quiet of dawn is split asunder by wailing screams from a steam siren . It is the Dayton sawmill , waking up villagers and farmers for miles around . From 5 until 6:30 the blasts continue . The hamlet and the fantastic cross between a circus and a holy war that is in progress there come slowly to life . <P> Along the main street of the village , where everyone in town sees everyone else within five minutes , peddlers , hucksters , hot-sausage men ( they call their wares " hot monkeys " now ) , pamphleteers , itinerant evangelists , prepare themselves and their goods for another day 's trafficking . <P> The holder of the barbecue concession on the courthouse lawn builds up his fire and heaves half an ox on the coals . The field secretary of an anti-Evolution society picks his teeth and adds a note or two of his stock harangue , delivered thrice daily : " Shall we be taxed to damn our children ? " An evangelist-bookseller looks proudly up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOD OR GORILLA , BRYAN 'S BOOKS FOR SALE HERE . <P> A preacher from Georgia in a bungalow on wheels drowsily draws on his outlandish costume-alpaca coat , shabby policeman 's trousers and an opera hat- and hopes that the new day may bring him an audience for his weird sermon proving that Negroes are not human beings . The barker for a tent show called The She-Devil clears his throat . <P> In a forest clearing outside the town , exhausted Holy Rollers snore under the shrubbery after a night 's orgy of insane gesticulation and acrobatics incited by a mouthing , syncopating professional ecstatic . Sid Strunk , the village policeman , ruminates over his breakfast coffee that it is a good thing they have brought reserves from Chattanooga . About 8 o'clock , dusty wagons , gigs , buggies and small automobiles come jogging in along the country roads . In them are gaunt farmers , their wives in gingham and children in overalls , who crowd toward the court house to get seats for the day 's proceedings in the trial of Teacher John Thomas Scopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewildered instrument of Science and Faith which have accidentally chosen Dayton as their battleground and in whose wake has come the usual camp-following of freaks , fakes , mountebanks and parasites of publicity . <P> Smirking , gabbling , cynical minions of the press throng with the farmers-and that is all of the crowd . For all the publicity she has stirred up , or rather because of it , Dayton has not attracted the visitors she expected-eminent scientists , statesmen , politicians , financiers , society figures . <P> Events . Such was the scene . Two days before the trial , Lawyer William Jennings Bryan , chief of the prosecution , lumbered off a train from Florida . The populace , Bryan 's to a moron , yowled a welcome . Going to the house he had rented , Bryan took off his coat , wandered the streets in his shirt sleeves , a panoramic smile of blessing upon his perspiring countenance , an impressive pith helmet covering the bald , pink dome of his head .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
