Immediately after sundown any clear night there apppears in the southwestern sky near the horizon a star of the first magnitude and of the brilliancy of Aldebaran . This is Beta Ceti , formerly on the outermost reaches of the known stellar system , a second magnitude star of the constellation of the Whale . Eighty years ago it suddenly flared up to double its brightness , a fact that our astronomers have just learned ( since Beta Ceti is 80 light-years away ) . <P> Such sudden increase in brilliancy of fixed stars is not uncommon . Most astronomers believe that the changes are due to eruptions within each particular star , and that the sun spots we observe from time to time are similar , though trifling , eruptions within our sun . Since the stars that suddenly become twice as brilliant are supposed to be in about the same stage of development as our sun , the latter too might at any time flare up as the stars have done ; and if it did , the intense heat would consume everything on earth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grass . This unpleasant assumption is based on mere conjecture . It is a known fact , however , that these variable stars eventually drop back to their original magnitude or brilliancy.
