txt // pen-name of Max Adeler . Out of the Hurly-Burly ( 1874 ) was his first and best book . A former generation took great delight in the consolatory obituary verses that an ambitious poet named Slimmer is depicted as composing for The Morning Argus during the absence of the editor : The death-angel smote Alexander McGlue , And gave him protracted repose ; He wore a checked shirt and a Number Nine shoe , And he had a pink wart on his nose . No doubt he is happier dwelling in space Over there on the evergreen shore . His friends are informed that his funeral takes place Precisely at quarter-past four . This and a half-dozen similar absurdities were quoted everywhere and led many readers to discover the more restrained humor that pervades most of the book . Samuel L. Clemens ( Mark Twain ) ( 1835 ? 1010 ) 4 . Our Greatest Humorist . Samuel Langhorne Clemens was born in Florida , Mo. , in 1835 , of a family that had migrated from Virginia . Most of his boyhood was spent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve his father died . He learned the printing trade and worked as a journeyman in New York and Philadelphia . At twentyone he secured a position on a Mississippi River steamboat , and quickly qualified as a pilot . Later he drifted to the far West and saw rough life in the Nevada and California mining-camps during the wild days of the gold-fever . He was , however , more successful as a reporter than as a miner . In 1863 , while in Virginia City , Nev. , he met Artemus // Ward , who encouraged him to write sketches for New York newspapers . The first story that attracted much attention appeared two years later as " Jim Smiley and His Jumping Frog . " His career as a humorous lecturer began in San Francisco in 1866 . He collected some of his stories in book form in 1867 as The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County , and Other Sketches . Soon after began his famous five months ' excursion to southern Europe and the Holy Land . The result of a newspaper commission to write letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Innocents Abroad ( 1869 ) , which America and Europe immediately accepted as a masterpiece of humor . Half a million copies were sold , and Mark Twain 's reputation as our leading humorist was firmly established . 5 . The Busy Years. ? Twain was too good a journalist to rest on the laurels of his first great success . After his removal in 1871 to Hartford , which remained his home for many years , he wrote Roughing It ( 1872 ) , an account of his early adventures in the West and in the Sandwich Islands . It is not autobiography , but a rollicking distortion of fact . The Gilded Age ( 1874 ) , written in collaboration with Charles Dudley Warner , is a somewhat uneven social satire , in which he created the delightful character of Colonel Mulberry Sellers , most optimistic of speculators , who fostered his financial enterprises with the reassuring statement : " There 's millions in it . " The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ( 1876 ) , Twain 's next book , is the classic of boyhood life in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been written into the narrative . It is unlikely that American boys will ever tire of // reading how Tom whitewashed the fence , how he won a Bible at Sunday-school , how he and Joe Harper took a solemn oath , signing their names in blood , how they played pirates , how they went after hidden treasure , and all the rest of that admirable tale . It is a masterpiece of a vanished phase of American life , replete with racy humor and vivid with local color . A Tramp Abroad ( 1880 ) related further travel experiences , but was less successful than The Innocents Abroad . A marked departure in subject-matter was made in The Prince and the Pauper ( 1882 ) , which is based on a legend relating the exchange of clothes and rank between a beggar boy and the young prince who became Edward VI of England . Although Twain was apparently writing historical fist ion for youthful readers , there is much social satire and caustic commentary in the book . Life on the Mississippi ( 1882 ) was a return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first part of the book . It was followed by The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ( 1884 ) , a sequel to Tom Sawyer , and a more artistic book . Younger readers almost invariably prefer Tom Sawyer , but competent critics acclaim Huckleberry Finn as Twain 's most notable contribution to American fiction . 6 . Darker Days. ? In 1.88 ' 1 Twain became a partner in the Hartford publishing house that issued his books , and thus hoped to share to a larger extent in the profits that attended their publication . Ile once more undertook a historical novel with satirical intention , and produced A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court ( 1889 ) , which is a clever story with its local color well preserved , but he lost no opportunity to expose the iniquities of the old monarAMERICAN // chical system and the days of chivalry . Pudd'nhead Wilson ( 1894 ) is a dramatic story of Western life with the background of negro slavery . Financial trouble overtook his publishing house in 1895 and caused its failure . Although sixty years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter Scott , in a similar Edinburgh failure , he labored incessantly to meet the heavy obligations . He made a lecture tour of the world , and wrote so rapidly that he finally succeeded iii cancelling the debt . His sympathetic study of Joan of Arc ( 1896 ) was a serious piece of historical work put forth anonymously during that distracting period to establish his claim to legitimate authorship . In his later works Twain showed a disposition to turn philosopher and to treat a great variety of subjects to which he had given more or less attention . A bitter pessimistic strain pervades much of the writing of that period , and seems strangely out of keeping with the earlier buoyant spirit of the merry humorist . Twain was highly honored , both at home and abroad , during his declining years . Yale and Oxford conferred honorary degrees upon him , and he enjoyed to the end the gratitude of the innumerable readers throughout the world who knew his books and treasured the recollection of his merriest quips and jests. 7 . Later Western Humorists. ? When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humorists appeared on the scene . Robert J. Burdette ( 1844-1914 ) was a clergyman who wrote comic sketches for the Burlington ( Iowa ) Hawkeye in a style that soon found many imitators . Edgar W. Nye ( 1850-1896 ) , a really capable humorist who // wrote as " Bill Nye , " wasted his talents on trivialities , and even wrote comic histories of England and the United States . Gelett Burgess ( 1866 ? ) , editor of The Lark in San Francisco , became noted for his excellent parodies , but most famous for his nonsense poem " The Purple Cow " and for his hooks on the various kinds of " goops . " George Ade ( 1867 ? ) , an Indiana journalist , wrote a number of successful plays and librettos , and is responsible for Fables in Slang ( 1900 ) and similar books in which he developed a humorous manner that was in sharp contrast with the more obvious methods of older humorists : A very attractive Debutante knew two young Men who called on her every Thursday Evening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the Kind that you see wearing Spring Overcoats in the Clothing Advertisements . One was named Fred and the other was Eustace . The Mothers of the Neighborhood often remarked , " What Perfect Manners Fred awl Eustace have ! " Merely as an aside , it may be added that Fred and Eustace were more popular with the Mothers than they were with the Younger Set , although no one could say a Word against either of them . Only , it was rumored in Keen Society that they did n't Belong . The fact that they went ( ' ailing in a Crowd , and took their Mandolins along , Tony give the Acute Reader some Idea of the Life that Fred and Eustace held out to the Young Women of their Acquaintance . Finley Peter Dunne ( 1867 ? ) , a Chicago journalist , created the humorous Irish-American philosopher Mr. Dooley , and had to write a great many " Dooley books " before the public was satisfied . I+or more than a decade it sought to have the opinion of Mr. Dooley on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike the slang-laden subtleties of Mr. Ade , shows a reversion to the // quaint spelling and the exaggeration that marked earlier American humor : " Well , sir , " said Mr. Hennessy , " that Alaska 's th ' gr-reat place .

" Oliver Herford ( 1863- ) , although born in England , has made his home in New York City for many years , and may properly be included among our leading writers of humorous verse . From the publication of The Bashful Earthquake ( 1898 ) to the present time , he has produced more than a score of volumes made up of witty poems . In A Child 's Primer of Natural History ( 1899 ) we find a fair example of his humor in " The Chimpanzee " : Children , behold the Chimpanzee : He sits on the ancestral tree From which we sprang in ages gone . I 'm glad we sprang : had we held on , We might , for aught that I can say , Be horrid Chimpanzees to-day . 8 . Recent Humor. ? Within the present generation a new group of humorists have become popular , mainly because the American public was pleased with the distinctive manner in which each of those writers proclaimed his mes206 THE STORY OF OUR LITERATURE sage . Thus Wallace Irwin ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time commented on Occidental affairs with the naive indirection and unexpected turn of thought that one might find in an Oriental . Irwin gave us Hashimura Togo 's views on baseball , mollycoddles , servants , American slang , and a host of other subjects . Irvin S. Cobb ( 1876 ? ) , who came to know life as driver of an ice-wagon , reporter , and professional humorist , really deserves to be considered among our best writers of short stories . Not only in his admirable Judge Priest stories , which smack of the soil and are genuine social documents , but especially in " The Belled Buzzard , " one of the finest of stories , has he revealed his talent as a writer of fiction . The public insists , however , upon regarding him as a funny man , and expects him to write funny things . Carolyn Wells , cleverest of parodists , has written numerous witty poems and several entertaining stories , but she is best known as a compiler of excellent anthologies of verse . Her gift of imitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she takes liberties with " The Blessed I ) amozel " in a parody called " The foster ( girl , " which begins : The blessed Poster girl leaned out From a pinky-purple heaven .

Montague Glass ( 1877 ? ) created the amusing Jewish partners in the cloak and suit business , Abe Potash and Mawruss Perlmutter , and wrote many intimate sketches // that indicated his familiarity with certain features of Yiddish-American mercantile life . Ring W. Lardner ( 1885- ) , writer of humorous sporting articles , won fame with " You Know Me , Al , " and with " Gullible 's Travels " ; since then his admirers have had ample opportunity to learn his views on a great variety of topics . Our reading public is so generous in its adulation of those who entertain us with whimsical or frivolous literary fare that few humorists can avoid the temptation to write too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often against their better judgment . No other nation demands such a variety of extravagant jesting , of newspaper " comics " and of " funny columns , " but all such diversions , no matter how entertaining , are beyond the pale of literature . CHAPTER XI THE POETRY OF LATER DAYS The Spirit of Modern Literature ? The Poetic Revival ? Emily Dickinson ? Edwin Markham ? Edith M. Thomas ? Vers de Societe ? Madison J. Cawein ? The New Tradition ? Edwin Arlington Robinson ? Edgar Lee Masters ? Amy Lowell ? Robert Frost ? Vachel Lindsay ? The Minor Choir ? Sarah Teasdale ? Alan Seeger. 1 . The Spirit of Modern Literature. ? Up to the time of the Civil War and during the years of reconstruction that followed , our literature was sectional and decidedly selfconscious . Since that period a variety of influences has brought about a larger , finer nationalism than our country had previously known . The shifting of population to the West , the opening of the Pacific coast as a result of building the transcontinental railroads , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intellectual aristocracy of New England were but a few of the influences that figured in the change . The Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876 , the first of its kind held in America , was an important factor in nationalization , and was followed by the more ambitious expositions of Chicago ( 1893 ) , St. Louis ( 1904 ) , and various others . At these great exhibitions of our material and scientific progress such noteworthy inventions as the telephone , the typewriter , and the electric light have stimulated pride in American achievement . 208 // Since 1900 there was another change in our conception of nationalism following the Spanish-American War , and still more marked was the change after the Great War of 1914-1918 . During the present generation literature has been produced more widely than ever before and in greater abundance . The cheap magazines have multiplied , and seek to satisfy a craving for sensational short stories . The rapid action and melodramatic character of moving-picture scenarios have been reflected in the current taste for literature . There have been striking changes in our political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orderly course of human events has been much disturbed . The whole world finds itself occupied with unpleasant economic problems that must be solved ; society is restless and is feeding upon its nerves . Individuals feel more and more called upon to express themselves and take some part in the intellectual life of the age . Men and women of all professions have joined the writers and devote part of their time to producing short stories , essays , or casual verse for the magazines . The more ambitious undertake the writing of novels or plays , frequently with little or no comprehension of the technic of literary art . 2 . The Poetic Revival. ? During the last decade of the nineteenth century the Victorian tradition in English poetry and the corresponding imitative tradition in American poetry came to an end . No other great singers arose to take the place of the notable poets who had passed away . The younger generation who sought in vain for a hearing in the standard magazines had recourse to such ephemeral periodicals as The Chap Book , The Lark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in imitation of The Yellow Book of London . Within the last two decades , however , there has been a wide-spread revival of interest in contemporary poetry . The events of the last few years have especially influenced the production of lyrical verse . America shared in the great emotional wave that swept over civilization . Our best magazines now give a fair allotment of their space to verse , and a number of newer periodicals are entirely devoted to the poetry of the younger generation . A few names that belong to the transitional period deserve attention before we consider those that represent the new tradition . 3 . Emily Dickinson ( 18:30 ? 1886 ) was born in Amherst , Mass. , where her father was treasurer of Amherst College . She was a woman of retiring disposition , and for many years ( lid not leave her home . Only a few of her poems were published during her lifetime . The three volumes of poetry that were brought out , between 189I ) and 1596 revealed the recluse as a genius of emotional intensity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . show that although she was whimsical and uncertain in her moods , she possessed unusual insight and a strange elfin personality . She was most successful in the composition of short lyrical pieces like " A Word " : A word is ( lead When it is said , Some say . I say it just Begins to live That day . // There is a note of Oriental fatalism in this quatrain that breathes something of the spirit of Omar khayyam : We never know we go , ? when we are going We jest and shut the door ; Fate following behind us bolts it And we accost no more . Still more characteristic is this charming bit of imaginative verse : To make a prairie it takes clover and one bee , One clover and a bee , And revery . The revery alone will do If bees are few . 4 . Lloyd Mifflin ( 1846-1921 ) , an artist , born at Columbia , Pa. , did not become conspicuous as a poet until he was past fifty years of age . His fame rests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1905 ) in London . During his lifetime Mifflin wrote more than 600 sonnets , a number probably unsurpassed by any other American poet . Moreover , most of them are of unusually high quality , and represent his complete mastery of a difficult form which even such admirable poets as Tennyson and Browning could not achieve . His fine tribute to his fellow poets in " The Sovereigns " is a fair specimen of his work : They who create rob death of half its stings ; They , from the dim inane and vague opaque Of nothingness , build with their thought , and make Enduring entities and beauteous things ; They are the Poets ? they give airy wings ? // To shapes marmorean ; or they overtake The Ideal with the brush , or , soaring , wake Far in the rolling clouds their glorious strings . The Poet is the only potentate ; His sceptre reaches o'er remotest zones ; His thoughts remembered and his golden tones Shall , in the ears of nations uncreate , Roll on for ages and reverberate When Kings are dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) spent a long lifetime writing poetry , yet he achieved fame when near fifty with a single poem . Born iii Oregon City , Ore. , he spent a strenuous youth in California , where he engaged in farming , blacksmithing , and cattle-herding . Later he became a school principal ; roil superintendent . His poem " The Man with the Hoe " ( 1852- ) , based on a well-known painting by Millet , received wide and instunt acclaim as an inspired lyrical protest against human degradation : Bowed by the weight of centuries he leans 1 poll his hoc and gazes on the ground , The emptiness of ages in his face , And on his back the harden of the world . Who made hint dotal to rapture and despair , A thing that grieves not and that never hopes , Stolid and stunned , a brother to the ox ? Who loosened and let down this brutal jaw ? Whose was the hand that . slanted back this brow ? Whose breath blew out the light within this brain ? No poem of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later poetry by Mr. Markham attracted quite so much attention . There are fine lines , however , in his noble tribute to " Lincoln , the Man of the People " : // Sprung from the West , The strength of virgin forests braced his mind , The hush of spacious prairies stilled his soul . Up from log cabin to the Capitol , One fire was on his spirit , one resolve : ? To send the keen axe to the root of wrong , Clearing a free way for the feet of God . And evermore he burned to do his decd With the fine stroke and gesture of a king : He built the rail-pile as he built the State , Pouring his splendid strength through every blow ; The conscience of him testing every stroke , To make his deed the measure of a man . Mr. Markham has made a thorough study of child-labor , and has written much on that subject . He is regarded to-day as the " dean " of living American poets . 6 . Edith M. Thomas ( 1854 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is noted for her command of colorful phrasing in her verse . For many years she has contributed a variety of poems to our magazines , and later collected them in book form . Her writings also include several excellent prose sketches in a chastened , classic style . Like Lloyd Mifflin , she won a distinctive position among American poets for her skill in handling the sonnet form . An excellent example of her art is the sonnet entitled " Frost " : How small a tooth hath mined the season 's heart ' How cold a touch hath set the wood on fire , Until it blazes like a costly pyre Built for some Ganges emperor , old and swart , Soul-sped on clouds of incense ! Whose the art That webs the streams each morn with silver wire , Delicate as the tension of a lyre , Whose falchion pries the chestnut-burr apart ? % // It is the Frost , a rude and Gothic sprite , Who doth unbuild the Summer 's palaced wealth , And puts her dear loves all to sword or flight ; Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builds again with jealous stealth , And sets a mimic garden , cold and bright . Several of her noblest poems were inspired by the tragic course of events during the Great War . These showed more intensity of feeling and less of the polished intellectual quality that characterizes much of her earlier work . 7 . Vers de Societe. ? During the closing years of the nineteenth century a number of minor poets attracted attention to their rrrs ( la sv , ciete , or society verse , which means a light , graceful treatment of subjects of current social interest . Many of them became skilled iii the use of such French forms as the triplet , the ballade , the rondeau , the rondel , and the villanelle , which had been practised in England with great success by such poets as Dobson , Lang , Henley , and others . Among 11w best. - known American poets in this group was Henry Cuyler Burner ( 1855-1896 ) , the author of Airs from Arcady and Elsewhere ( 1884 ) , in which he sings : Oh , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arcady , Oh , what 's the way to Arcady ; Where all the leaves are merry ? Oh , what 's the way to Arcady ? The spring is rustling in the tree The tree the wind is blowing through ? It sets the blossoms flickering white . // I knew not skies could burn so blue Nor any breezes blow so light . They blow an old-time way for me , Across the world to Arcady . The most admired of his shorter poems is this dainty triolet , which has all the characteristic charm of that exotic form : A pitcher of mignonette , In the tenement 's highest casement : Queer sort of flower-pot ? yet That pitcher of mignonette Is a garden in heaven set , To the little sick child in the basement ? The pitcher of mignonette , In the tenement 's highest casement . Bunner was also a master of the short story , owing much of his art to his careful study of the French master , Guy de Maupassant . A poet of still greater promise was the Philadelphian Charles Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find such gems as " Star Dust " : Innumerable ages since ? before The sun 's gold paled to silver on the moon , Or earth ran round to take on both their hues , A monstrous bubble , out of chaos blown , Swelled through the dusk ? grew luminous ? and lit All space an instant ; ? then with ringing shock Burst ! ? and from out the jewelled mist there swung Millions of stars to glow forevermore ! Frank Dempster Sherman ( 1860-1916 ) , whose versewriting supplemented his professional duties as an architect t // and a professor at Columbia University , collected his fugitive poems under such attractive titles as Madrigals and Catches ( 1887 ) and Lyrics for a Lute ( 1890 ) . IIe excelled in the writing of beautiful quatrains , such as " Moonrise " : Within this silent palace of the Night , See how the moon , like some huge phantom moth , Creeps slowly up across the azure cloth That hangs between the darkness and the light . A still more prolific poet is Clinton Scollard ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his early manhood to the fine lyrics in his War Voices and Memories ( 1919 ) . He has not only the light , graceful manner of the writer of poetic trifles , but can on occasion give us such rich verbal music as we find in hi , ; poem beginning As I came down from Lebanon , Came winding , wandering slowly down Through mountain passes bleak and brown , The cloudless day was well-nigh done . The city , like an opal set In emerald , showed each minaret Afire with radiant beams of sun , And glistened orange , fig , and lime , Where song-birds made melodious chime , As I came down from Labanon. 8 . Richard Hovey ( 1864-4900 ) , a native of Normal , Ill. , and a graduate of Dartmouth , ranks among our most ambitious dramatic poets , but his early death cut short a career of great promise . IIe was well read in Elizabethan poetry and in the works of the French symbolists . In collaboration with the Canadian poet Bliss Carman he wrote // Songs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extolling the wild life of the road : Whose furthest footstep never strayed Beyond the village of his birth Is but a lodger for the night In this old wayside inn of earth . To-morrow he shall take his pack , And set out for the ways beyond On the old trail from star to star , An alien and a vagabond . There is a rollicking lyrical quality in his fatalistic poem " At the Crossroads , " which begins : You to the left and I to the right , For the ways of men must sever And it well may be for a day and a night , And it well may be forever . But whether we meet or whether we part ( For our ways are past our knowing ) , A pledge from the heart to its fellow heart On the ways we all are going ! Here 's luck ! For we know not where we are going . Hovey retold the Arthurian legend in a series of dramatic poems that were eventually brought together in five volumes as Launcelot and Guenevere ( 1907 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and emphasized the glamour of old romance rather than the underlying moral lesson . 9 . Madison J. Cawein ( 1865 ? 1914 ) was one of the most prolific of poets . IIe was born in Louisville , Ky. , began writing verse while he was a high-school student , and kept // on writing until more than twenty volumes had appeared . In 1907 all his poems written up to that time were brought together in five substantial volumes . Cawein was at his best in descriptive nature-poetry , but also wrote some excellent poetic narratives on themes connected with Kentucky life . His artistic creed was well stated in his " Proem " : There is no rhyme that is half so sweet As the song of the wind in the rippling wheat ; There is no meter that 's half so fine As the lilt of the brook under rock and vine ; And the loveliest lyric I ever heard Was the wildwood strain of a forest bird . If the wind and the brook and the bird would teach My heart their beautiful parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , My soul would sing of beauty and myth In a rhyme and a. meter that none before Have sung in their love , or dreamed in their lore , And the work would be richer one poet the more . Few nature-poets make such frequent reference to the wind as Cawein . The very first allusion in the " Proem " to the " song of the wind " prepares us to anticipate the ornate loveliness of his sonnet called " The Winds " : Those hewers of the clouds , the Winds , ? that lair At the four compass-point s , ? are out to-night ; I hear their sandals trample on the height , I hear their voices trumpet through the air : Builders of storms , God 's workmen , now they bear , Up the steep stair of sky , on backs of might , Huge tempest bulks , while , sweat that blinds their sight , ? The rain is shaken from tumultuous hair : Now , sweepers of the firmament , they broom Like gathered dust , the rolling mists along // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of skyey corridor and celestial room Preparing with large laughter and loud song , For the white moon and stars to wander through . Fortunately , Cawein 's best poetry is not lost amid his less-important work , but is reprinted in a volume of Selected Poems ( 1913 ) , edited with an introduction by William Dean Howells . The same capable editor performed a similar service when he wrote an introduction for the Lyrics of Lowly Life ( 1896 ) , written by the talented young negro poet Paul Lawrence Dunbar ( 1872-1906 ) , who is regarded as the most gifted writer thus far produced by the negro race . Dunbar has many fine poems in standard English , but is at his best in negro dialect , as in " Discovered " : Seen you down at chu'ch las ' night , Nevah min ' , Miss Lucy . What I mean ? Oh , dat 's all right , Nevah min ' , Miss Lucy . You was sma't es sma't could be , But you could n't hid f'om me . Ai n't I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy . 10 . Thomas A. Daly ( 1871 ? ) , a Philadelphian , is among the most widely read of contemporary poets , and even more prolific than Cawein . For several years he wrote a poem a day for the newspapers . His range is from the grotesquely humorous to the sentimental , but he is especially happy in his interpretation of Italian-American life . In fact , he is generally regarded as the acclaimed laureate of " Little Italy , " the familiar name for the Italian sections in // our larger cities . Some of his best poems are gathered in Carmina ( 1909 ) and in McAroni Ballads ( 1919 ) . His manner is well illustrated by a stanza from " Mia Carlotta " : Giuseppe , da barber , ees greata for " mash , " He got ta da bigga , da blacka mustache , Good clo'es an ' good styla an ' playnta good cash . W'enevra Giuseppe ees walk on da street , Da people dey talka , " how nobby ! how neat !

Josephine Preston Peabody ( 157.1-1922 ) , a graduate of Radcliffe College , was a Intel . of fine lyrical quality , but she did not win wile-spread recognition until she published " The Piper " ( 1909 ) , a poctie dramatization of the old German legend of the " Pied Piper of Hamelin . " This beautiful interpretation of the myth that inspired Robert Browning 's familiar poem won the Stratford-on-Avon Prize , and was successfully produced in England and in America . The play presents with rare understanding the thoughts and emotions of the children who watch the antics of Michaelthe-Sword-Eater , and who listen to the seductive piping of the stranger . It puts them iii sharp contrast with the stupid , pennywise townsfolk who sought to cheat the piper out of the thousand guilders which they had promised him // for ridding Hamelin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Piper " ranks high in the history of American literary drama . 12 . The New Tradition. ? A distinctive era in the progress of American poetry began about 1910 , and made rapid strides during the following decade . The leaders in this group were inclined to disregard the conventions of poetic form and to formulate for themselves new means of expression in verse or in " polyphonic prose . " Although their work was largely individual and not the result of any concerted effort to discredit older poetic standards , they looked upon the usual metrical rules and limitations as outworn devices . They felt that the time was ripe for newer flights of song in which our poetic renascence could express itself in a manner that was not imitative , but original and distinctive . The leaders in this movement were Edwin A. Robinson , Edgar Lee Masters , and Amy Lowell . Robert Frost and Vachel Lindsay began their important work only a few years later .

He represents a transition from the older poetry to the new . His fame began with " The Town down the River " ( 1910 ) , which is notable for its clear-cut descriptions and its character studies . Among the best of these is " The Master , " an interesting delineation of Lincoln , supposedly by a contemporary : // The face that in our vision feels Again the venom that we flung , Transfigured to the world reveals The vigilance to which we clung . Shrewd , hallowed , harassed , and among The mysteries that are untold , The face we see was never young , Nor could it ever have been old . In " The Man against the Sky " ( 1916 ) is a fine characterization of Shakespeare that makes of the great dramatist a very human figure .

His Collected Poem. ? ( 1921 ) won the Pulitzer Prize as the best volume of verse published i " America during that year . Mr. Robinson has beet ' called " the Henry James of American verse , " and probably does not object to that title . 14 . Edgar Lee Masters ( I S69- ) made an immediate leap into fame with The Spoon River Anthology ( 1915 ) , a distinctly new idea in poetic subject-matter . That book was made up of a series of remarkable epitaphs ? cynical , humorous , satirical , or tragic that proclaimed the hidden life of a typical American country town in the Middle West .

It was bad enough to run a clothing store in this town , But to be buried here ? ach 1 Altogether different in spirit is the noble tribute to Lincoln 's sweetheart : ANNE RUTLEDGE Out of me unworthy and unknown The vibrations of deathless music ; " With malice toward none , with charity for all .

References in some of the epitaphs to persons immortalized elsewhere in the collection furnish the clew for a thread // of narrative and enable the reader to patch together some of the unsavory incidents in the past life of Spoon River 's dead . 15 . Amy Lowell ( 1874- ) , a native of Brookline , Mass. , travelled widely and read much before she devoted herself to the cause of poetry ; then she underwent an apprenticeship of eight years before she published her first poem ( 1910 ) in The Atlantic Monthly . Since that time Miss Lowell has been an ardent champion of vers libre , or free verse , and has occasioned endless discussions between those who favor the apparent irregularities of the new order and those who prefer the regular rhythms of traditional metres . In all of Miss Lowell 's volumes of verse are numerous illustrations of her own effective practice in the newer forms and of her keen sense of sound values in creating verbal music , whether in vrrs are or iu what she pleases to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color entitled " Ombre Chinoise " : Red foxgloves against a yellow wall streaked with plum-coloured sahdows ; A lady with a blue and red sunshade ; The slow dash of waves upon a parapet . That is all . Non-existent ? immortal As solid as the centre of a ring of gold . Equally fascinating is the little " lacquer print " which she entitles " The Emperor 's Garden " : Once , in the sultry heat of midsummer , An Emperor caused the miniature mountains in his garden // To be covered with white silk , That so crowned , They might cool his eyes With the sparkle of snow . But Miss Lowell has given to her best poetry other noteworthy qualities besides mere succession of pleasant ideas and building of pretty pictures . The more conventional rhythms do not obscure the strong emotional value of these lines : I grasped a thread of silver ; it cut me to the bone ? I reached for an apple ; it was bleak as a stone ? I reached for a heart , and touched a raw blade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little gift of speech Set a cubit higher than the common reach , A debt running on until the fool is dead . In her critical volumes , Six French Poets ( 1915 ) and Tendencies in Modern American Poetry ( 1917 ) , Miss Lowell reveals her extremely modern point of view and her evident contempt for the Victorian tradition . 16 . Robert Frost ( 1875 ? ) has had valuable experience as teacher , farmer , and college professor at Amherst . His reputation as a poet was achieved by the collections of narrative verse entitled A Boy 's Will ( 1913 ) and North of Boston ( 1914 ) . These give grimly realistic pictures of contemporary life in rural New England.His delineations of farm life are unforgetable in their stark fidelity to truth . Mr. Frost lacks lyrical quality , but uses blank verse with consummate skill in his meditative or descriptive passages , such as these lines from " An Old Man 's Winter Night " : // All out of doors looked darkly in at hint Through the thin frost , almost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms . What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand . What kept him from remembering what it was That brought him to that creaking room was age . His poetry is bleak and depressing at times , but it proclaims him a close observer of nature in all her moods . There is something of Wordsworth 's simplicity of diction and straightforwardness in these lines from " Birches " : When I see birches bend to left and right Across the line of straighter darker trees , I like to think son e boy 's been swinging them . But swinging does n't bend them down to stay . Ice-storms do that . Often you must have seen them Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning After a rain . They ' click upon themselves As the breeze rises , and turn many-colored As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel . Soon the sun 's warmth slakes them shed crystal shells Shattering and avalanching ( ) II the snow-crust  - -  Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Wordsworth , man lives very close to nature in the pages of Mr. Frost . A few deft phrases serve to make clear the pathos or the tragedy of the situation in which his men and women find themselves . 17 . Nicholas Vachel Lindsay ( 1879 ? ) is one of the most original of the younger poets . After studying art for several years he devoted much of his time to tramping about in various parts of the country , and eventually voiced his // philosophy of life , both in prose and in verse , in A Handy Guide for Beggars ( 1916 ) . His first poem to arouse general comment was " General Booth Enters into Heaven " ( 1913 ) , a sympathetic study of the great Salvation Army leader . " The Congo " ( 1919 ) is a crude , realistic picture of the primitive backgrounds of the negro race . In wild , irregular measures he presents a vision of the river scene : Then I saw the Congo , creeping through the black , Cutting through the jungle with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles Tattooed cannibals danced in files ; Then I heard the boom of the blood-lust song And a thigh-bone beating on a tin-pan gong . In his second vision a very different scene is spread before us : A negro fairyland swung into view , A minstrel river Where dreams come true . The ebony palace soared on high Through the blossoming trees to the evening sky . The inlaid porches and casements shone With gold and ivory and elephant-bone . And the black crowd laughed till their sides were sore At the baboon butler in the agate door . The outbreak of the Great War inspired the more stately and equally memorable poem " Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight " ( 1914 ) , in which the spirit of " the prairieIawyer , master of us all , " is represented as pacing restlessly up and down near the old court-house of Springfield , with head bowed at the prospect of the impending slaughter // and the bitter sorrow that the war is to bring into countless homes : It breaks his heart that things must murder still , That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain . And who will bring white peace That he may sleep upon his hill again ? 18 . The Minor Choir. ? Many other singers attracted attention by their artistic verse during the poetic revival of the past decade . Witter Bynner ( 1881 ? ) is best known for his Grenstonc Poems ( 1917 ) , a series of nearly 200 brief lyrics in a loosely connected sequence . Behind the simplicity of diction in these and other poems by Mr. Bynner there is usually a wealth of ideas . His manner is well illustrated in the poem " A Farmer Remembers Lincoln , " in which an old Yankee recalls his youthful service on guard duty at Washington toward the end of ' the Civil War . A pleasing picture of the martyred President is drawn in the closing lines : And he was a jolly old fellow always cheerful ; He was n't so high but the hays could talk to him their own ways . While I was servin ' at the I lospital He 'd come in and say , " You look nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he 'd bend over and talk to the boys ? And he 'd talk so good to ' em ? so close ? That 's why I call him a farmer . I do n't mean that everything about him was n't all right , you understand , It 's just ? well , I was a farmer And he was my neighbor , anybody 's neighbor . I guess even you young folks would ' a ' liked him . // Sarah Teasdale ( 1884 ? ) , an accomplished lyrical poet , has written several memorable dramatic dialogues devoted to famous women of history and art . Her Love Songs ( 1917 ) were awarded the Columbia University Prize of $500 for the best book of American poetry . Few of our recent poets have shown such fine lyrical quality as we note in these verses : I asked the heaven of stars What . I should give my love ? It answered me with silence , Silence above . Oh , I could give him weeping , Or I could give him song ? But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kilmer ( 1886 ? 1918 ) , who was a teacher and later an editor in New York , wrote many pleasing verses , the best of which are to be found in Trees and Other Poems ( 1915 ) . His charming little poem on " Trees " concludes : Poems are made by fools like me , But only God can make a tree . Soon after the United States entered the Great War he enlisted , and had attained the rank of sergeant when he was killed in action in France . Alan Seeger ( 1888 ? 1916 ) was another young poet of promise who made the supreme sacrifice . Shortly after the outbreak of the Great War he enlisted in the Foreign Legion of France . He wrote a noble " Ode in Memory of the // American Volunteers Fallen in France , " but he will be best remembered for his prophetic " I Have a Rendezvous with Death , " one of the really notable poems inspired by the war , and sadly verified when he fell in action at Belloy-enSanterre : I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring comes back with rustling shade And apple-blossoms fill the air ? I have a rendezvous with Death When Spring brings back blue days and fair . 19 . Other Recent Poets. ? There is great variety and rich promise itt the work of Anna Hempstead Branch , who at times gives us such naive survivals of the older tradition as we find in these lines : God wove a web of loveliness , Of clouds and stars iuul birds , But made not anything at all do beautiful as words . Carl Sandburg ( 1878 ? ) shows much of the quality of Walt Whitman in his Chicago Poems ( 1915 ) and Cornhuskers ( 1918 ) , but although he is often vigorous and realistic in his treatment of life 's crudities , he can also create such music as we find in " Monotone " ; The monotone of the rain is beautiful , And the sudden rise and slow relapse Of the long multitudinous rain . The sun on the hills is beautiful , Or a captured sunset , sea-flung , Bannered with fire and gold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginative quality that seems to delight in an unexpected juxtaposition of incongruous ideas , as in his " Morning Song from Senlin , " which begins : It is morning , Senlin says , and in the morning When the light drips through the shutters like the dew , I arise , I face the sunrise , And do the things my fathers learned to do . Stars in the purple dusk above the rooftops Pale in a saffron mist and seem to die , And I myself on swiftly tilting planet Stand before a glass and tie my tie . Even less shackled by the formal conventions is the work of Alfred Kreymborg ( 1883 ? ) , who takes great liberties in his poem entitled " Old Manuscript " : The sky is that beautiful old parchment in which the sun and the moon keep their diary . To read it all , one must be a linguist more learned than Father Wisdom and a visionary more clairvoyant than Mother Dream . John Gould Fletcher and Hilda Doolittle ( " H. D. " ) are the chief exponents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimations of detail in pictorial representation rather than a fully wrought description . Mr. Fletcher needs only five lines for his poem " The Skaters " : Black swallows swooping or gliding In a flurry of entangled loops and curves ; // The skaters skim over the frozen river . And the grinding click of their skates as they impinge upon the surface , Is like the brushing together of thin wing-tips of silver . " H. D. " requires but a handful of words for her " Oread " : Whirl up , sea Whirl your pointed pines . Splash your great pines On our rocks . Hurl your green over us ? Cover us with your pools of fir . Most of the " imagist " poems are studies in verbal tone . Observe the musical values and the riot of color in these verses from Mr. F'letcher 's " Irradiations " : Whirlpools of purple and gold , Winds from the mountains of cinnabar , Lacquered mandarin moments , palanquins swaying and balancing Amid the vermilion pavilions , against the jade balustrades ; Glint of the glittering wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flakes settling downwards . Still more remarkable are the novel cinquains or five-line poems which the late Adelaide Crapsey ( 1878 ? 1914 ) devised and wrote with such consummate skill . This cinquain is entitled " The Warning " : Just now Out of the strange Still dusk . . . as strange , as still . . . A white moth flew . . . . Why am I grown So cold ? Recently several observant critics have expressed the opinion that the quality of the work produced by the newer CHAPTER XII LATER AMERICAN DRAMA The New Dramatic School ?

The Literary Dramatists ? William Vaughn Moody ? Charles Hann Kennedy ? Percy Mackaye ? Writers of Melodrama ? Edward Sheldon ? Eugene O'Neill. 1 . The New Dramatic School. ? Literary drama did not appeal to many of the American poets of the nineteenth century ; only Longfellow and Aldrich made conspicuous attempts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage success as the work of such less important writers as Bird and Boker . The American stage of that period produced a large number of capable actors , but virtually no plays of abiding value . Various influences have been blamed for our low dramatic standards . 1 ) uring the greater part of the century the American stage merely reflected the equally uninspired British stage . Those who supplied the plays for both countries were not men of letters but practical craftsmen . Toward the end of the century there was an evident dramatic awakening on the Continent of Europe as a result of the notable work of the Scandinavian dramatist Henrik Ibsen , and this influence became most manifest in England after 1890 . The Victorian stage improved , but there was no corresponding school of American dramatists . The theatrical " syndicate " which began about 1895 to control the 234
