The last of the " crucial " primaries was held in West Virginia . Smith beat Reed . His nomination looked as certain as such things can look upon a planet inhabited by human beings . <P> Favorite Son Goff beat Candidate Hoover . It was a preferential primary , leaving the delegates uninstructed , and three of the 19 delegates elected were regarded as Hooverites . But the popular vote stood-Goff 120,337 ; Hoover , 105,876 . The usual comments were made : 1 ) That the Hoover boom had passed its peak , would now collapse ; 2 ) That the Beaver Man had made a splendid showing . <P> Democrats sat back to see what decision the Republican 1,089 delegates , all of whom were now chosen , would come to among themselves . The votes of 545 would settle the matter , but with many a delegate unpledged , many another uncertain , many another unaccredited , the result could not be figured out to a mathematical certainty on paper .
