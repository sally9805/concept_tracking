Samuel Gompers , President of the American Federation of Labor , appreciates fully the value of publicity . Every week he denounces some public figure or organization , or " points with pride " to some achievement of Labor , thus keeping himself and his cause perpetually in the public eye . His latest fulminations are directed against the radicals in the Federation and their attempt to make May Day the official Red Letter and Red Action holiday of the working class . <P> In a speech before the United Cloth Hat and Cap Workers of America he rang a general alarm against men of " William Z. Foster 's type " and their efforts to " bore from within " the Federation by means of " internal cliques " such as the Trade Union Educational League . " If these men had all the gold of the capitalist class in their pockets they could not better serve the capitalists to the detriment of the working man than by doing just what they are doing , " said Mr. Gompers . <P> As for May Day , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for American Labor . It has none of the sinister , revolutionary meaning that it has in Europe . In America , Labor Day is September 1 , which is not a Red day but a day for rejoicing . <P> Thus Mr. Gompers refutes the belief , held by many Americans , that organized Labor has points in common with Reds . " American Labor is evolutionary and constructive . It declines to adopt any of the shibboleths or symbols of revolutionary movements ! "
