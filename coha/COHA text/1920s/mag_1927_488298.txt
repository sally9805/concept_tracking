GAIN a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States quickens the belief that justice may still on occasion prevail in America against wrongdoers in the seats of the mighty at Washington , against the big-business thieves who steal millions and their journalistic protectors . In the Teapot Dome case the court has followed its own precedent of the Doheny-Elk Hills suit , and has declared the leasing of the Wyoming naval-oil lands by Sinclair to have been " procured by corruption " and to have been " tainted with fraud " from beginning to end . It again brands ex-Secretary Fall , who took the $100,000 bribe from Doheny , as a " faithless public officer , " and repudiates his story that the $230,000 worth of Liberty bonds passed to him by Harry Sinclair constituted a legitimate transaction . It was , the court declares , a " clandestine and unexplainable acquisition " of " sinister significance . " For all time these men and their associates are thus branded as crooks by the highest court in the land , from which there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their criminal trial now taking place in Washington will be . The Supreme Court has stamped them as faithless Americans who cheated and betrayed their country in order to line their pockets . The deep significance of this goes far beyond the recovery of the oil lands . This is the final triumph of the movement to purge the government which was set on foot by one great but bitterly calumniated American , the late Robert M. La Follette , who called attention to what was going on a year before public action began . He was ignored by the majority in the Senate and out , although The Nation and other free journals and the few Progressive Senators came to his aid . But when , under the leadership of Senators Walsh and Wheeler of Montana , the Senate inquiries were set on foot , all the forces of big business and of the commercialized daily press mustered successfully to destroy the effectiveness of that attack . One would have thought that these Senators were the arch criminals  --  not those whom the Supreme Court has just convicted of everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers printed with highest editorial approval the statement sent out by the Republican National Committee in March , 1924 : If the innovation of proving honest men and public officials guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors by introducing testimony of convicts and ex-convicts , crooks , forgers , bribe-takers , murderers , train robbers , and other criminals is to be followed , then there is no end in sight of the present investigations until all the inmates of our penitentiaries have been put on the stand . The deliberate adoption of the policy of writing down the scandals , in which pleasant pastime no newspapers were more distinguished than our highly respectable New York Times and Herald Tribune , succeeded in confusing the public mind so that the rascals were not driven out of public office at the next election and Mr. Coolidge , who retained Daugherty and Denby and never once has lifted his voice to denounce corruption in high office , was reelected . We agree with the New York Telegram that this decision of the Supreme Court is an imperishable monument to Robert M. La Follette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group of Progressives who haveboldly met together , Senator Borah sitting with them , to run an honest man for the Presidency in the Republican primaries , and to declare their allegiance again to the Progressive causes which have been betrayed and sold out by the Democracy of Woodrow Wilson as well as by the crooked and debased party that was once Abraham Lincoln 's . Not only do the mills of the gods continue to grind exceeding fine ; the spirit of revolt can not be downed . It is well that the editorial writers of the New York Times are again ridiculing the handful of honest men in Washington ; it is proper that these new editorial assaults should appear simultaneously with the Teapot Dome decision . If it had rested with the Times the Doheny and the Sinclair cases would never have reached the Supreme Court ; they would have been smothered under its deprecations of the " muckrakers " and " scandal-mongers , " the " mud-throwers " to whom , and to whom alone , we owe the fact that the good name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been vindicated . For ourselves , we hail with joy the announcement of Senator Borah , Senator Nye , Senator Norris , and their associates that they are determined to do their uttermost to prevent the nomination of another Harding ready to put criminals in the Cabinet , or of another Coolidge ever ready servilely to lick the boots of Big Business  --  as he has again done in Pittsburgh where he has praised the brothers Mellon , owners of the crookedest of crooked political machines , as the type of men whom the students of Pittsburgh 's colleges should regard as the finest in the land . It is impossible to tell what results this group action will have in the country and in the next Republican convention , but it can only be heartening and inspiring to every decent-minded American that these men are willing once more to stand in the open to face the fresh press attacks which will come to them for championing anew the righteousness that brought the Cabinet crooks of Warren Harding to justice . They can exert a profound influence . They can perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority . They can give to millions of citizens the opportunity to vote in the primaries for one of the finest Americans , and one of the most devoted of patriots who ever went to Washington , Senator George W. Norris of Nebraska . True , Daugherty and Fall are not yet in jail . We care nothing for that ; we would not send anybody to jail as jails are now organized and run . The glorious fact is that a great wrong has been undone ; that some of the millions stolen from the American people have been restored ; and that the group of honest men , which makes Congress such a living force , is again on the warpath , reinforced by Senator James A. Reed of Missouri . Senator Reed has just refreshingly told the truth by saying that Harry Daugherty is " as vile an insect as ever crawled across the page of time , " and has drawn fresh attention to the fact that the present President of the United States never lifted a hand to expose the oil-land fraud , but " remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach in the month of August . " Thank fortune , the Republic is getting back to a period of political activity and to the good old-fashioned American practice of calling men by their right names , however high the offices they hold . Exhibitions and Expositions THEN the Philadelphia Sesquicentennial Exhibition shut down after six ghastly months , with losses run-ning into the millions , there were many to say that the day of such exhibitions , or fairs , was over . The public , it was contended , knows so much of what is going on in the world through the radio , the movie , and the illustrated daily , that - it is too sophisticated to be drawn readily to a celebration like that in Philadelphia . At the Chicago World 's Fair the Venetian gondolas and the Javanese village fascinated millions to whom they were entire novelties . Today every child has seen Javanese and Ceylonese villages on the screen and more romances than one in which the hero escapes the doge 's headsman by lying in the bottom of a gondola as it drifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but false . The Sesquicentennial failed because it deserved to fail . It was conceived in politics and born in graft , or near-graft , and inefficiency . It was never really finished and what there was did not fill the beholder with enthusiasm . The public knows when it has been fooled , and , unlike some of the spectators observed by Huckleberry Finn , did not pretend that it had seen a wonderful show in order that others might also be fooled . It went home and told the truth . By contrast a three weeks ' exhibition which has just closed near Baltimore has been an amazing success  --  the Baltimore &; Ohio celebration of the first century of its existence . Originally planned for two weeks , the " Fair of the Iron Horse " had to be extended for another week and it could have been extended indefinitely . Yet it was not advertised in New York and other cities . It was not opened by a great political light and baptized with fulsome oratory . There was no jazz , and there were no " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , souvenirs , and soft drinks , - there was no entrance fee , and the railroad charged only twenty-five cents for the round trip of sixteen miles from Baltimore and return . It was an exhibition frankly devoted to one purpose  --  the history of railroad transportation , and yet the place was crowded  --  on one weekday 81,000 persons jammed the trains from Baltimore until they suggested the New York subways . In two weeks 1,200,000 persons attended the exhibit . An entrance fee would not have deterred these crowds ; they were extraordinarily intelligent and they were extraordinarily interested in what they saw . They were obviously familiar with the movies . Yet they stood many rows deep about the Indian village , and though doubtless many had seen the movie entitled " The Iron Horse " and in dozens of films had become familiar with the prairie schooner , they were fascinated by the real schooners and the Wells-Fargo stage that appeared in the pageant . The show succeeded because it was a good show , admirably put on , and the circumstance that the Baltimore &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can -- not hide that fact . It was a B. &; O. show , but it was more than that . For the Pennsylvania and the New York Central were there , too , and an English railroad had-sent its finest new engine , the " King George V , " as an act of friendship and good-will . Daniel - Willard , the president , and Edward Hungerford , who was the director for the B. &; 0. , were wise enough to make this a remarkable historical , exhibit and to realize that the exhibits themselves were the road 's best advertisements . The visitor never felt that the B. &; 0 . was being rammed down his throat at every turn . It was all as much worth while from the standpoint of every railroad in the country as from that of Mr. Willard 's . After the first three or four days there was no need to announce the show ; the banners and posters could have been taken down  --  the crowd would still have poured out . For the pageant given twice a day told concisely-the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of the - Indian 's birch-bark canoe and " bull-boats " to the latest train de luxe . The trains all went past the reviewing-stand under - their own steam  --  even engines acquired by the B. &; 0 . ninety-seven years ago . The public was thrilled when , for instance , the first train ever run in Minnesota steamed past in quaint simplicity , and in old-fashioned yellow. - It climbed into the latest engine-cabs with the same thirst for knowledge which made it joyously examine the first Pullman and that tragic engine , " The General , " whose capture by- Northern soldiers and recapture , with the ensuing - execution as spies of some of the Federals , was one of the most daring and dramatic episodes of the Civil War . And not a cheap side-show anywhere ; no fat women , no Siamese twins ; just pieces of machinery , old or superb in their modernity . Nor was an automobile , or a radio , or an airplane to be seen. - They did not exist for the Fair of the Iron Horse . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even have stimulated a taste for the real instead of the pictured thing . The Baltimore &; Ohio has proved that crowds will come to study and be instructed , provided they are given the worth-while and the genuine in a straightforward and honest manner . - What Is Happening in China - W HEN - the Chinese Nationalists started North from the Yangtze River last spring , the Japanese landed troops in Shantung , advanced them inland along- the railway , and announced that in order to protect Japanese lives and property they would not permit military operations in the neutral zones thus established . The Nationalists were unable to advance ; behind the Japanese screen the Northerners reformed their forces . And after the Nationalists had been driven South the Japanese announced that they would-withdraw their forces from Shantung . We have not yet heard that they have done so . The tide of civil war- shifted westward . Yen Shi-shan , China 's prize fence-rider , the governor of Shansi Province , who through sixteen years of- revolution had managed to maintain neutrality and keep his province from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle . For three years he had wavered and wabbled . He had , ostensibly , made alliances with the North  --  but had stayed at home when invited to- enter battle on the- North 's side . This year he flew the banner of the Nationalists and advanced against Peking . There is reason to believe that he- was urged forward by promises of aid from the " Christian general , " Feng Yuhsiang , whose promises have so often proved treacherous ; and the net effect of Governor Yen 's attempt to take the Northern , capital may be that Feng will take Yen 's place as commander of the rich province of Shansi . Feng , after two years on - the edge of the desert , needs a more fertile camp for his armies . At any rate , Yen 's army has been driven back by the Northern forces which owe allegiance to Chang Tso-lin , who in turn remembers that Japan has more than once saved his forces , from destruction . The center and south of China remain in the hands of vaguely defined groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hankow Government the generals seem to be more important than the Nationalism . No general can hold power in that territory without yielding lip-allegiance at least to the principles of Sun Yat-sen ; but most of them have been crushing as ruthlessly as any Northerner the peasant associations and labor unions which gave that movement its broad basis in the civilian population . A so-called " Communist " army has established itself in Kiangsi Province and at Swatow in northern Kwangtung , but it has yet to prove itself more genuinely devoted to the people than the other armies which prey on the civilian population . Feng and Yen , in the Northwest , also declare allegiance to Dr. Sun 's principles , but theirs are again personal militdry dictatorships . Meanwhile , in this moment of discouragement , Japan is quietly forcing the issue and tightening her grip upon Manchuria . When , after the Washington Conference in 1922 , Japan returned Shantung Province to China , she left unsurrendered the claims upon Manchuria which she had extorted from China as part of the infamous Twenty-one Demands of 1915 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by force majeure , was invalid ; the American Government refused to recognize at least certain parts of it ; and for a time the Japanese Government , secure in essential control of Manchuria , seemed content to let the matter rest . But Japan today has a new Government , committed to a " positive policy " in China . Japan now demands that Japanese citizens be permitted to lease lands and erect buildings anywhere in Manchuria  --  a right not allowed foreigners in other parts of China ; that China should cease building railway lines in Manchuria which parallel and rival Japan 's South Manchuria Railway ; that the Chinese agree to extension of the Japanese lines in Manchuria ; and that the Chinese permit Japan to open a new consulate in Linkiang  --  a town where Japan has no trade , but which has been a center of the Korean independence movement . Furthermore , Japan is reorganizing her bureaucracy in Manchuria , giving more power to the officials of the South Manchurian Railway  --  a railway which is a government in itself , with a certain territorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own coal and iron mines . And , finally , the Japanese Diplomatic Review , a semi-official publication , has been rewriting history , voicing the curious doctrine that the Chinese " have no voice at all in regard to Manchuria and Mongolia " ? a plain hint of annexation to come . In North Manchuria the Japanese have encouraged the Chinese to drive the Russians out of control of the Chinese Eastern Railway . There the Japanese lose their hallowed respect for the sanctity of treaties ; and the Chinese , with their open encouragement , have seized the fleet which was a joint Chinese-Russian property , taken over administration of the railway schools , flooded the offices with incompetent Chinese employees , and forced the Russians to deposit half the receipts-in Chinese banks . It is , from the point of view of Chinese Nationalism , a healthy precedent , but the Japanese do not intend to let it be followed in South Manchuria ; they are eager only to get rid of rival Russian influence . So today the question of immediate importance is not whether an army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inchoate force of Nationalism will be strong enough , even in Northern territory , to stop Japan 's program of gradual annexation . Well , Then , a Short Cheer M HE other heroes of the air seem somewhat more than I mortal , but not Levine . And it is heartening to have a demigod capable of supplying that clay which makes for comfort and controversy . This transatlantic flying has , in its latter days , assumed grim aspects . There is need for knocking at the door and for some porter to amble on and relieve the tension with the proper touch of rowdy comedy . Others may choose to remember Lindbergh alone , facing the fell clutch of sleet , but there is more warmth in the picture of Levine bouncing about on Croydon field . They say that when the wheels of the Columbia first touched the soil of England the plane rose up again full twenty feet as if even the red earth spurned this little man in business attire . Most of the traditions of the air Levine has violated . It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of commercial instinct . However , it should be added that it was the role of Potash which he played and not that of Morgan . Out of his schemes he seems to have profited very little and at the moment the only rewards within his grasp appear to be a speech from Mayor Walker and a complimentary dinner in Far Rockaway . Whether it was his intent or not Charles A. Levine looms up as the purest amateur who ever leaped across the broad Atlantic . Chivalry and sportsmanship are beautiful , and a little false . Levine has earned by being far more frank than any of the others . " Lindbergh had all the luck , " he is supposed to have said when the Columbia grounded obscurely in a German village . This was bad taste and niggling , but surely it was also an honest expression of opinion . A tactless man goes naked into the world and must fight at each cross-road in his journey . Such has been the fate of Levine . The records show that he has bickered with everyone he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around all heroes , and it may be that one anecdote associated with the flier is not quite literally true . " No , " said a man across whose field Levine and Chamberlin passed in the night , " I did not see the plane but I know they went this way because I heard them arguing . " Not for Levine will be the roses and the motion-picture offers . There is no evidence that he has been asked to give out autographs and kisses . Some wit has said that his return up through the canyons of New York City would be unmarked by the traditional ticker tape of triumph and that instead subpoenas would rain from every window . But after all , there is no getting away from the fact that he flew across the ocean . He is not Galahad precisely or anyone in shining armor , but the Atlantic is just as dangerous and deep for the ludicrous as for the sublime . It has been something of a strain to play up to the various immaculate heroes . We have been upon our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even stoop a little , as we reach out a hand toward this little flying tradesman , and there need be no lack of cordiality in the greeting as we shake his hand and say , with true Far Rockaway courtesy , " Excuse my glove .
