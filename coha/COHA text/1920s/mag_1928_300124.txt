Mrs. Anne Urquhart Stillman , 48 , wife of a rich man who was once a banker , has long had dealings with reporters . She has thrown crockery at them , which has served only to make them come closer . At last , she has taken some of them into her pay , for she has financed and founded Panorama , " New York 's Illustrated News Weekly . " The first red-covered issue appeared last week . About half of it consisted of good-to-excellent photographs , and half , of poor-to-passable articles . Neither photographs nor articles were apropos anything in particular . <P> Panorama says , in its masthead , that it is " founded on a belief in the United States of America , its flag and its institutions . " But , also , Panorama admits a desire to emulate The Illustrated London News and similar European publications . It was difficult to discover what class of scatter-brained women Panorama was intended primarily to interest . The first issue contained an able and informative article on Arthur Brisbane by John K. Winkler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a remarkable photograph of a giant tortoise . Fannie Brice told her " own story " and some Indians were observed worshipping God-in-Nature on a mountain peak ( via Underwood &; Underwood photograph ) . Mrs. Stillman wrote on Paris fashions , not far from a huge photograph of herself . The U. S. institutions discussed-and apparently believed in-were " West Point-Its Idea " and " Broadway-from Pabst to Nedick . " There was no discussion of the flag .
