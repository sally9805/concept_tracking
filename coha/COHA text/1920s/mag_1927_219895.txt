That great , gentle mathematician War Minister Paul Painlev asked a favor last week of his good friend Joseph Paul-Boncour , leader of the Right Wing Socialists , outstanding pacifist , fervent champion of the League of Nations before which he represented France in 1924-25 . All that M. Painlev asked of M. Paul-Boncour was that he would introduce and sponsor in the Chamber a bill proposing to spend 7,000,000 francs ( $280,000 ) forthwith on armaments to protect the frontiers of France . <P> Enlightened , Pacifist Paul-Boncour inspected the bill , found it good and " purely defensive , " introduced it with all the weight of his influence and the persuasion of his lawyer oratory before the Chamber . <P> " Down with War ! " chanted the Communists , drubbing and banging on their desks . They were particularly incensed at a clause which would make every man , woman and child in France liable to be drafted for combat or work behind the lines . " This bill proposes , " cried a Communist , " nothing less than to make the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Painlev said : " The Mass Mobilization Bill only insures daily collaboration between the economic and military defenders of France . . . . No effort should be spared to avoid the cataclysm which , the next time , would wipe out entire populations , without distinction to age or sex . Any statesman who does not dwell on these thoughts is not worthy of public trust . " <P> The bill , subjecting all France , male and female , to the draft , passed 500-31.
