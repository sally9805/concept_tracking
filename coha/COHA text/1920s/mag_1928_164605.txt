" The first week after a national convention , " said the New York Times after the Houston convention , " is always devoted to the noble political art of climbing aboard . There ought to be a rule against looking when the ungraceful act is performed . " <P> So inevitable was the Smith nomination , however , that most Democrats of any account were aboard the Smith wagon before the self-starter was depressed . As a result , there was very little " crow-eating " in the Democracy last week . <P> Opposing candidates for the nomination had anticipated the " ungraceful act " by promising to support whatever ticket was chosen . Josephus Daniels , Governor Dan Moody of Texas , Governor L. G. Hardman of Georgia and many another solved the problem by saying , simply : " I am a Democrat . " Thomas Pryor Gore , the blind , facetious , onetime-Senator from Oklahoma who seconded Reed at Houston , frankly switched to Smith . Even bitter little Senator Simmons of North Carolina turned the other cheek , last week . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work actively for Smith . But he pointed to his Democratic record , held his peace . <P> Leaving the Smith bandwagon in what they hoped was the lurch were : <P> Senator James Thomas ( " Tom Tom " ) Heflin of Alabama , who suggested that the South nominate a new set of Democratic electors and vote for them . <P> Thomas B. Love , a candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Texas , who said : " As between chronic corruption and acute corruption , I prefer the acute . I want strongly to turn the rascals out , but I am just as strongly opposed to turning Tammany Hall in . I intend definitely to vote against Smith . ... As long as I live I am going to stay in the Democratic party . "
