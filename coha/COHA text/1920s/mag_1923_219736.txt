The severe regulation imposed by the New York Stock Exchange upon its members with respect to their firm advertisements , as well as its strict control over its ticker price quotations , have been endangered through the sudden perfection of radio broadcasting . By a recent resolution , the Board of Governors has forbidden the use of the wireless by its members either for advertising or publicity purposes , or for promiscuous relaying of Stock Exchange quotations . The latter will , however , be permitted in the case of broadcasting stations approved by the Exchange . The aim of the restrictions upon member advertising is to prevent undesirable public speculation ; the Exchange 's control of its prices is exercised to prevent their use by bucketshops.
