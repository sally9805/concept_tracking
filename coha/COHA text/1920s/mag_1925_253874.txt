The Arctic Circle kept its secret a fourth week . With Explorer Roald Amundsen of Norway , and his air pilot , Lincoln Ellsworth of Manhattan , still missing somewhere up towards the Pole ( TIME , June 1 et seq. ) the Norwegian steamer Ingcrtrc , sent to rescue them , dropped anchor in a Spitzbergen fjord . A party of aviators aboard her unlashed their two seaplanes and waited for Amundsen 's base ship , the Fram , to come back from the icefloes with a weather report before taking off for a flight to inspect horizons further north . <P> In more livable portions of the globe , conjecture on Amundsen 's fate continued . <P> Governor J. Daugaard Jensen of Greenland : " I believe he used so much petrol that he was unable to return to his starting place and therefore flew as far as possible toward Cape Columbia Ellesmere Land , about 250 miles nearer the Pole than Spitzbergen . " <P> Explorer Donald B. MacMillan was ci the same opinion . In the midst of final preparations for his own flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined the rescue work he proposed to carry out before any explorations . After making a base at Etah , Greenland , early in August , he would , he said , take two planes to Cape Columbia to see if Amundsen had reached there . If he had not , the planes would then fly on the line from Cape Columbia to the <P> Pole , Amundsen 's direct line of retreat , circling south and east on their way back . The success of this search would rest largely on whether or not Amundsen had got marooned on drift ice , which would carry him southeast , around the tip of Greenland at the ' rate of about 10 miles a day . MacMillan 's third plane would wait at Etah or Cape Columbia in case the rescuers needed rescuing . <P> The MacMillan expedition , commissioned by the National Geographic Society , is equipped , as Amundsen was not , with radio instruments . The Loening amphibian seaplanes lent by the U. S. Navy are smaller than the cumbersome Durnier-Wahls taken by Amundsen , easier to handle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much farther north that they will be able to reconnoitre slowly and widely before making any such dashes as Amundsen 's . On every flight it takes , each machine will carry twice the quantity of gas and oil needed for the distance planned . <P> Last week , MacMillan 's planes , under Lieut . Commander Richard E. Byrd , flew from Philadelphia via the Delaware River , foggy Montauk Point , L. I. , and the Cape Cod Canal , to Boston , where Mayor Curley gave a luncheon for the fliers . MacMillan also attended this ceremonial meal , then returned to Southport , Me. , where he had just taken his schooner Bozvdoin to have her sails bent on . His own ship , the Peary , waited at Wiscasset , Me. , where the dismantled planes were to be loaded aboard and the start made on Bunker Hill Day ( June 17 ) . Governor Brewster of Maine planned the event as a state function with speeches , brass bands and official godspeed.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
