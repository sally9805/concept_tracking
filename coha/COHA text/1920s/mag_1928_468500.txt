WHAT Americans call the Negro problem is almost as old as America itself . For three cen ? turies the Negro in this country has been tagged with an interrogation point ; the question propounded , however , has not always been the same . Indeed , the question has run all the way from whether or not the Negro was a human being , down ? or tip ? to whether or not the Negro shall be accorded full and unlim ? ited American citizenship . Therefore , the Negro problem is not a problem in the sense of being a fixed proposition in ? volving certain invariable factors and waiting to be worked out according to certain defined rules . It is not a static condition ; rather , it is and always has been a series of shifting interracial situa ? tions , never precisely the same in any two generations . As these situations have shifted , the methods and manners of dealing with them have constantly changed . And never has there been such a swift and vital shift as the one which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there a more revolutionary change in attitudes than the one which is now going on . The question of the races ? white and black ? has occupied much of America 's time and thought . Many methods for a solution of the problem have been tried ? most of them tried an the Negro , for one of the mistakes commonly made in dealing with this matter has been the failure of white America to take into account the Negro himself and the forces he was generating and sending out . Thequestion repeated generation after gen ? eration has been : what shall we do with the Negro ? ? ignoring completely the power of the Negro to do something for himself , and even something to America . It is a new thought that the Negro has helped to shape and mold and make America . It is , perhaps , a startling thought that America would not be pre ? cisely the America it is to-day except for the powerful , if silent , influence the Negro has exerted upon it ? both posi ? tively and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shocked by a contemplation of the effects which have been wrought upon its inherent char ? acter by the negative power which the Negro has involuntarily and unwittingly wielded . A number of approaches to the heart of the race problem have been tried : religious , educational , political , indus ? trial , ethical , economic , sociological . Along several of these approaches con ? siderable progress has been made . To ? day a newer approach is being tried , an approach which discards most of the older methods . It requires a minimum of pleas , or propaganda , or philanthropy . It depends more upon what the Negro himself does than upon what someone does for him . It is the approach along the line of intellectual and artistic achievement by Negroes , and may be called the art approach to the Negro problem . This method of approaching a solution of the race question has the advantage of affording great and rapid progress with least friction and of pro viding a common platform upon which most people are willing to stand . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finality , to be the thing itself that was to be demonstrated . I have said that this is a newer ap ? proach to the race problem ; that is only in a sense true . The Negro has been using this method for a very long time ; for a longer time than he has used any other method , and , perhaps , with farther-reaching effectiveness . For more than a century his great folk-art contributions have been exerting an ameliorating effect , slight and perhaps , in any one period , imperceptible , nevertheless , cu ? mulative . In countless and diverse situations song and dance have been both a sword and a shield for the Negro . Take the Spirituals : for sixty years , be ? ginning with their introduction to the world by the Fisk Jubilee Singers , these songs have touched and stirred the hearts of people and brought about a smoothing down of the rougher edges of prejudice against the Negro . Indeed , nobody can hear Negroes sing this won ? derful music in its primitive beauty with ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , then , that is new ? What is new consists largely in the changing attitude of the American people . There is a coming to light and notice of efforts that have been going on for a long while , and a public apprecia ? tion of their results . Note , for example , the change in the reaction to the Spir ? ituals . Fifty years ago white people who heard the Spirituals were touched and moved with sympathy and pity for the " poor Negro . " To-day the effect is not one of pity for the Negro 's condition , but admiration for the creative genius of the race . All of the Negro 's folk-art creations have undergone a new evaluation . His sacred music ? the Spirituals ; his secular music ? Ragtime , Blues , Jazz , and the work songs ; his folk lore ? the Uncle Remus plantation tales ; and his dances have received a new and higher appre ? ciation . Indeed , I dare to say that it isnow more or less generally acknowledged that the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American life , and been universally recognized as distinctively American products , are the folk creations of the Negro . The one thing that may be termed artistic , by which the United States is known the world over , is its Negro-derived popular music . The folk creations of the Negro have not only received a new appreciation ; they have ? the Spirituals excepted ? been taken over and assimilated . They are no longer racial , they are national ; they have become a part of our common cul ? tural fund . Negro secular music has been developed into American popular music ; Negro dances have been made into our national art of dancing ; even the plantation tales have been trans ? formed and have come out as popular bedtime stories . The Spirituals are still distinct Negro folk songs , but sooner or later our serious composers will take them as material to go into the making of the " great American music " that has so long been looked for . But the story does not halt at this point . The Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the national attitudes toward him ; and now the efforts of the race have been reinforced and magnified by the indi ? vidual Negro artist , the conscious artist . It is fortunate that the individual Negro artist has emerged ; for it is more than probable that with the ending of the creative period of Miles , which seems to be at hand , the whole folk creative effort , of the Negro in the United States will come to a close . All the psychological and environmental forces are working to that end . At any rate , it is the indi ? vidual Negro artist that is now doing most to effect a crumbling of the inner walls of race prejudice ; there are outer and inner walls . The emergence of the individual artist is the result of the same phenomenon that brought about the new evaluation and appreciation of the folk-art , creations . But it should be borne in mind that the conscious Afra ? merican artist is not an entirely new thing . What is new about him is chiefly the evaluation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this happen ? The entire change , which is marked by the shedding of a new light on the artistic and intellectual achievements of the Negro , the whole period which has be ? come ineptly known as " the Negro renaissance , " is the matter of a decade ; it has all taken place within the last ten years . More forces than anyone can name have been at work to create the existing state ; however , several of them may be pointed out . What took place had no appearance of a development ; it seemed more like a sudden awakening , an almost instantaneous change . There was nothing that immediately preceded it which foreshadowed what was to fol ? low . Those who were in the midst of the movement were as much astonished as anyone else to see the transformation . Overnight , as it were , America became aware that there were Negro artists and that they had something worth while to offer . This awareness first manifested itself in black America , for , strange as it may seem , Negroes themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness of their own individual artists . Black America awoke Grst to the fact that it possessed poets . This awakening fol ? lowed the entry of the United States into the Great War . Before this country had been in the war very long there was bitter disillusionment on the part of American Negroes ? on the part both of those working at home and those fighting in France to make the world safe for democracy . The disappointment and bitterness were taken up and voiced by a group of seven or eight Negro poets . They expressed what the race felt , what the race wanted to hear . They made the group at large articulate . Some of this poetry was the poetry of despair , but most of it was the poetry of protestand rebellion . Fenton Johnson wrote of civilization : am tired of work ; I am tired of building up somebody else 's civilization . Let us take a rest , Missy Jane . You will let the old shanty go to rot , the white people 's clothes turn to dust , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throw the children into the river ; civilization has given us too many . It is better to die than it is to grow up and find out that you are colored . Pluck the stars out of the heavens . The stars mark our destiny . The stars marked my destiny . I am tired of civilization . Joseph Cotter , a youth of twenty , inquired plaintively from the invalid 's bed to which he was confined : Brother , come ! And let us go unto our God . And when we stand before Him I shall say , " Lord , I do not hate , I am hated . I scourge no one , I am scourged . I covet no lands , My lands arc coveted . I mock no peoples , My people are mocked . " And , brother , what shall you say ? But among this whole group the voice that was most powerful was that of Claude McKay . Here was a true poet of great skill and wide range , who turned from creating the mood of poetic beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such poems as " Spring in New Hamp ? shire , " " The Harlem Dancer , " and " Flame Heart , " for example , and began pouring out cynicism , bitterness , and invective . For this purpose , incon ? gruous as it may seem , he took the sonnet form as his medium . There is nothing in American literature that strikes a more portentous note than these sonnet-tragedies of McKay . Here is the sestet of his sonnet , " The Lynching " : Day dawned , and soon the mixed crowds came to view The ghastly body swaying in the sun : The women thronged to look , but never a one Showed sorrow in her eyes of steely blue ; And little lads , lynchers that were to be , Danced round the dreadful thing in fiendish glee . The summer of 1919 was a terrifying period for the American Negro . There were race riots in Chicago and in Washington and in Omaha and in Phillips County , Arkansas ; and in Longview , Texas ; and in Knoxville , Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ com ? munities . Colored men and women , by dozens and by scores , were chased and beaten and killed in the streets . And from Claude McKay came this cry of defiant despair , sounded from the last ditch : If we must die ? let it not be like hogs Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot , Oh , Kinsmen ! We must meet the common foe ; Though far outnumbered , let us still be brave , And for their thousand blows deal one death ? blow ! What though before us lies the open grave ? Like men we 'll face the murderous , cowardly pack , Pressed to the wall , dying , but ? fighting back ! But not all the terror of the time could smother the poet of beauty and univer ? sality in McKay . In " America , " which opens with these lines : Although she feeds me bread of bitterness , And sinks into my throat her tiger 's tooth , Stealing my breath of life , I will confess I love this cultured hell that tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terness and hate into verse which by every test is true poetry and a fine son ? net . The poems of the Negro poets of the immediate post-war period were widely printed in Negro periodicals ; they were committed to memory ; they were recited at school exercises and public meetings ; and were discussed at private gather ? ings . Now , Negro poets were not new ; their line goes back a long way in Afra ? merican history . Between Phillis Wheat ? ley , who as a girl of eight or nine was landed in Roston from an African slave ship , in 1761 , and who published a vol ? ume of poems in 1773 , and Paul Lau ? rence Dunbar , who died in 1906 , there were more than thirty Negroes who pub ? lished volumes of verse ? some of it good , most of it mediocre , and much of it bad . The new thing was the effect produced by these poets who sprang up out of the war period . Negro poets had sounded similar notes before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a reverberating response , even in their own group . But the effect was not lim ? ited to black America ; several of these later poets in some subtle way affected white America . In any event , at just this time white America began to be ? come aware and to awaken . In the correlation of forces that brought about this result it might be pointed out that the culminating effect of the folk-art creations had gone far toward inducing a favorable state of mind . Doubtless it is also true that the new knowledge and opinions about the Negro in Africa ? that he was not just a howling savage , that he had a culture , that he had pro ? duced a vital art ? had directly affected opinion about the Negro in America . However it may have been , the Negro poets growing out of the war period were the forerunners of the individuals whose work is now being assayed and is receiving recognition in accordance with its worth . And yet , contemporaneously with the work of these poets a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ef ? fort which might have gone much farther at the time had it not been cut off by our entry into the War , but which , neverthe ? less , had its effect . Early in 1917 , in fact on the very day we entered the War , Mrs. Emily Hapgood produced at the Madi son Square Garden Theater three plays of Negro life by Ridgley Torrence , staged by Robert Edmond Jones , and played by an all-Negro cast . This was the first time that Negro actors in drama Commanded the serious attention of the critics and the general public . Two of the players , Opal Cooper and Inez Clough , were listed by George Jean Nathan among the ten actors giving the most distinguished performances of the year . No one who heard Opal Cooper chant the dream in the Rider of Dreams " can ever forget the thrill of it . A sensa ? tional feature of the production was the singing orchestra of Negro performers under the direction of J. Rosamond Johnson ? singing orchestras in theaters have since become common . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the stress of war crushed them out . In 19N , Charles Gilpin was en ? thusiastically and universally acclaimed for his acting in " The Emperor Jones . " The American stage has seldom seen such an outburst of acclamation . Mr. Gilpin was one of the ten persons voted by the Drama League as having done most for the American theater during the year . Most of the readers of these pages will remember the almost national crisis caused by his invitation to the Drama League Dinner . And along came Shuffle Along " ; and all of New York flocked to an out of the way theater in West Sixty-third Street to hear the most joyous sing ? ing and see the most exhilarating dancing to be found on any stage in the city . The dancing steps originally used by the " policeman " in - Shuffle Along " fur ? nished new material for hundreds of dancing men . " Shuffle Along " was ac ? tually an epoch-making musical comedy . Out of " Shuffle Along came Florence Mills , who , unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and in Europe as one of the finest singing comediennes the stage had ever seen and an artist of positive genius . In 1923 Roland Hayes stepped out on the American stage in a blaze of glory , making his first appearances as soloist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and later with the Philharmonic . Few single artists have packed such crowds into Carnegie Hall and the finest concert halls throughout the country as has Ro ? land Hayes ; and , notwithstanding the eclat with which America first received him , his reputation has continued to in ? crease and , besides , he is rated as one of the best box-office attractions in the whole concert field . Miss Marian Ander ? son appeared as soloist with the Philadel ? phia Symphony Orchestra and in concert at the Lewisohn Stadium at New York City College . Paul Robeson and J. Rosamond Johnson and Taylor Gordon sang Spirituals to large and appreciative audiences in New York and over the country , giving to those songs a fresh interpretation and a new vogue . Paul Robeson ? that most versatile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athlete , singer , and actor ? played in Eugene O'Neill 's " All God 's Chillim " and added to his reputation on the stage , and , moreover , put to the test an ancient taboo ; he played the principal role op ? posite a white woman . This feature of the play gave rise to a more acute crisis than did Gilpin 's invitation to the Drama League Dinner . Some sensational news ? papers predicted race riots and other dire disasters , but nothing of the sort hap ? pened ; the play went over without a boo . Robeson played the title role in a revival of " The Emperor Jones " and almost duplicated the sensation produced by Gilpin in the original presentation . There followed on the stage Julius Bledsoe , Rose McClendon , Frank Wil ? son , and Abbie Mitchell , all of whom gained recognition . At the time of this writing each of these four is playing in a Broadway production . Paradox ? ical it may seem , but no Negro comedian gained recognition in this decade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ognized American institution and there are several now before the public who are well known , but their reputations were made before this period . The only new reputations made on the comedy stage were made by women , Florence Mills and Ethel Waters . In addition there are the two famous Smiths , Bessie and Clara , singers of Blues and favorites of vaudeville , phono ? graph , and radio audiences . Of course there is Josephine Baker , but her repu ? tation was made entirely in Europe . Nevertheless , these magical ten years have worked a change upon Negro com ? edy . Before Miller and Lyles brought " Shuffle Along " to New York , managers here could hardly conceive of a Negro musical comedy playing a Broadway house . When Williams and Walker , Cole and Johnson , and Ernest Hogan were in their heyday , people who wanted to see them had to go to theaters outside the great white-light zone . George Walker died before the " new day , " and up to his retirement from the stage he kept up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a strictly Broadway theater . Since " Shuffle Along , " hardly a season has passed without seeing one or more Negro musical comedies playing in the finest theaters in New York . In fact , Negro plays and Negro performers in white plays on Broadway have be ? come usual occurrences , Odd has been the fate of the younger poets who were instrumental in bringing about the present state of affairs . It is a fact that none of them , with the ex ? ception of Claude McKay , quite suc ? ceeded in bridging over into it . Three of them , Roscoe Jamison , Lucian Watkins , and Joseph Cotter , are dead , all dying in their youth . Fenton Johnson is almost silent . And Claude McKay has for the past four or five years lived practically in exile . However , several of the older writers are busily at work , and there has sprung up in the last three or four years a group of newer creative writers . Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes have achieved recognition as poets . Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fisher have made a place among writers of fiction . And Claude McKay , after a period of silence as apoet , has published his Home to Har ? lem , a generally acclaimed novel . These are names that carry literary significance , and they take their places according to individual merit in the list of the makers of contemporary American literature . In addition , there are more than a score of younger writers who are not yet quite in the public eye , but will soon be more widely known . Writers such as these are bound to be known and in larger numbers , because their work now has the chance to gain whatever appreciation it merits . To-day the reagents that will discover what , of it is good are at work , the arbiters of our national letters are disposed to regard their good work as a part of American literature , and the public is prepared to accept it as such . This has not always been the case . Un ? til this recent period , the several achieve ? ments in writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less sporadic and isolated efforts , and not in any sense as having a direct relation to the national literature . Had the exist ? ing forces been at work at the time , the remarkable decade from 1895 to 1905 , which brought forth Booker T. Washing ? ton 's Up from Slavery , W. E. Burghardt Du Bois 's The Souls of Black Folk , Charles Chesnutt 's stories of Negro life , and Paul Laurence Dunbar 's poetry , might have signalled the beginning of the " Negro literary renaissance . " During the present decade the individ ? ual Negro artist has definitely emerged in three fields , in literature , in the theater , and on the concert stage ; in other fields he has not won marked dis ? tinction . To point to any achievement of distinction in painting the Negro must go back of this decade , back to H. 0 . Tanner , who has lived in Europe for the past thirty-five years ; or farther back to E. M. Bannister , who gained considerable recognition a half century ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mural painter , who lives in Chicago and has done a number of public buildings in the Middle West , and of Archibald J. Motley , who recently held a one-man exhibit in New York which attracted very favorable attention . The drawings of Aaron Douglas have won for him a place among American illus ? trators . To point to any work of ac ? know/edged excellence in sculpture the Negro must go back of this decade to the work of two women , Edmonia Lewis and Meta Warrick Fuller , both of whom received chiefly in Europe such recognition as they gained . There are several young painters and sculptors who are winning recognition . But the strangest lack is that With all the great native musical endowment he is conceded to possess , the Negro has not in this most propitious time produced a single outstanding composer . There are competent musicians and talented com ? posers of songs and detached bits of music , but no original composer who , in amount and standard of work and in recognition achieved , is at all comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can the Negro in the United States point back of this decade to even one such artist . It is a curious fact that the American Negro through his whole history has done more highly sustained and more fully rec ? ognized work in the composition of let ? ters than in the composition of music . It is the more curious when we consider that music is so innately a characteristic method of expression for the Negro . What , now , is the significance of this artistic activity on the part of the Negro and of its reactions on the American peo ? ple ? I think it is twofold . In the first place , the Negro is making some dis ? tinctive contributions to our common cultural store . I do not claim it is pos ? sible for these individual artists to pro ? duce anything comparable to the folk-art in distinctive values , but I do believe they are bringing something fresh and vital into American art , something from the store of their own racial genius ; warmth , color , movement , rhythm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty of sensuousness . I be ? lieve American art will be richer because of these elements in fuller quantity . But what is of deeper significance to the Negro himself is the effect that this artistic activity is producing upon his condition and status as a man and citi ? zen . I do not believe it an overstate ? ment to say that the " race problem " is fast reaching the stage of being more a question of national mental attitudes toward the Negro than a question of his actual condition . That is to say , it is not at all the problem of a moribund peo ? ple sinking into a slough of ignorance , poverty , and decay in the very midst of our civilization and despite all our ef ? forts to save them ; that would indeed be a problem . Rather is the problem com ? ing to consist in the hesitation and refusal to open new doors of opportunity at which these people are constantly knock ? ing . In other words , the problem for the Negro is reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with what he is and more a matter of dealing with what America thinks he is . Now , the truth is that the great ma ? jority of Americans have not thought about the Negro at all , except in a vague sort of way and in the form of tradi ? tional and erroneous stereotypes . Some of these stereotyped forms of thought arc quite absurd , yet they have had serious effects . Millions of Americans have had their opinions and attitudes regarding their fellow colored citizens determined by such a phrase as , " A nigger will steal , " or " Niggers are lazy , " or " Nig ? gers are dirty . " But there is a common , widespread , and persistent stereotyped idea regarding the Negro , and it is that he is here only to receive ; to be shaped into something new and unquestionably better . The common idea is that the Negro reached America intellectually , culturally , and morally empty , and that he is here to be filled  - -  filled with educa ? tion , filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture . Ina word , the stereotype is that the Negro is nothing more than a beggar at the gate of the nation , waiting to be thrown the crumbs of civilization . Through his artistic efforts the Negro is smashing this im ? memorial stereotype faster than he has ever done through any other method he has been able to use . He is making it realized that he is the possessor of a wealth of natural endowments and that he has long been a generous giver to America He is impressing upon the national mind the conviction that he is an active and important force in Ameri ? can life ; that he is a creator as well as a creature ; that he has given as well as re ? ceived ; that he is the potential giver of larger and richer contributions . In this way the Negro is bringing about an entirely new national concep ? tion of himself ; he has placed himself in an entirely new light before the Ameri ? can people . I do not think it too much to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting at the very core of the prejudice against him , by challenging the Nordic superior ? ity complex . A great deal has been ac ? complished in this decade of " renais ? sance . " Enough has been accomplished to make it seem almost amazing when we realize that there are less than twenty-five Negro artists who have more or less of national recognition ; and that it is they who have chiefly done the work . A great part of what they have accom ? plished has been done through the sort of publicity they have secured for the race . A generation ago the Negro was receiving lots of publicity , but nearly all of it was bad . There were front page stories with such headings as , " Negro Criminal , " " Negro Brute . " To-day one may see undesirable stories , but one may also read stories about Negro singers , Negro actors , Negro authors , Negro poets . The connotations of the very word " Negro " have been changed . A generation ago many Negroes were half or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to be proud of it . For many years and by many methods the Negro has been overcoming the coarser prejudices against him ; and when we consider how many of the subtler prejudices have crumbled , and crum ? bled rapidly under the process of art creation by the Negro , we are justified in taking a hopeful outlook toward the effect that the increase of recognized individual artists fivefold , tenfold , twentyfold , will have on this most perplexing and vital question before the American people .
