Eamom de Valera , New-York-State born Irishman , recently released from prison ( TIME . July 28 ) , harangued a crowd at Ennis , where , about one year ago , he was arrested by Free State troops ( TIME , Aug. 27 , 1923 ) . <P> Mr. de Valera 's speech was much the same as many another he has uttered . He advocated an Irish Republic , independence and unity of the Irish people . There was this difference , however : he failed to incite the crowd to violence ; he committed himself to a peaceful policy of establishing the republic by the power of the vote ; he expressed himself as forever faithful to the " Sinn Fein Constitution . " Said he : <P> " I shall be as faithful to that Constitution , in letter and in spirit , in the futu.re as I have been in the past . " <P> In common with his supporters , both in Ireland and abroad , his antagonism to Britain has become an hysteria , properly lacking rhyme and reason , dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> There is , however , this much to be said in defense of de Valera 's agitation for a republic . Britain herself , by a long series of unimaginable blunders and appalling procrastination , forced the Irish people to look to republicanism as the savior of their ancient liberty so long denied to them . But Britain , with unquestioned sincerity , despite unfortunate complications , has given proof of her desire to atone , as much as is in her power , for the past , by granting unfettered autonomy to the Free State as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations , and by showing determination in conforming to her treaty obligations . <P> But Mr. de Valera and his followers , a noisy minority , can not see the wood for the trees , and they continue to advocate an Irish Republic- possibly because such advocacy has become a habit . For the same reason he possibly continues to hate England . Thus , always playing on the same string , he stirs wild enthusiasm in the bosoms of those who think as he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lays claim to any right of exercising any authority whatsoever in or over Ireland , or any part of it , so long will there be need for the organization of republicans to oppose it . The need for this organization of opposition , the need for asserting our right to and demand for recognition of our full sovereignty and independence is particularly urgent at the present time . <P> " By national efforts , from 1917 to 1921 , the peoples of the world have been educated to understand the scope of our national demand . The moment England by threats had secured Irish sig natures to her so-called treaty , the organs of English propaganda through out the world were concentrated on making it appear that our national demand was conceded and Irish national aspirations were fully satisfied . <P> " To illustrate the effectiveness of this propaganda , I need only to point to the speech of John W. Davis , Democratic candidate for the Presidency of the United States , when he recently spoke of Ireland as ' having shaken off her long subjection . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly in America , may not ' be deceived and may not be tempted to relax their efforts in Ireland 's behalf until real freedom is achieved , let us send forth this plain message :
