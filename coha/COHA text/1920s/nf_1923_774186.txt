txt p 300 ceptions differ from his . He recognizes , standardizes , rewards certain psychotic or neurotic experiences ? socially channels them ? which we regard as well outside our socially approved channels . It is important for a clear grasp of the foregoing view to realize that it has no reference to the supernatural as such . Belief in God is not a sign of backwardness . All that is contended is that the bestowal of social rewards for the inability to distinguish subjective experiences from objective phenomena , or for the deliberate inversion of the two , is a presumable mark of lack of progress . In so far , then , as the mentally unwell in modern advanced cultures tend to correspond to the well and the influential in ancient and retarded cultures , at least in certain situations , we can accept objective progress as having taken place . I28 . MORE ABOUT PROGRESS There is a second group of traits that characterize backward as against advanced cultures . These have to do with the obtrusion of physiological or anatomical considerations into social situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human life . Some of these practices are : blood or animal sacrifice ; segregation of women at parturition and menstruation as being contaminating to others ; contamination by death or corpses , often with segregation of mourners until purified ; puberty crisis rites , especially for girls at the onset of physiological puberty ; preoccupation with the dead body , including mummification , skull preservation and skull cult , wearing of skull or jaw by widows , disinterment and reburial , eating of bits of the body or of cremation ashes ; ritual prostitution and inversion ; human sacrifice ; retainer burial ; head-hunting ; cannibalism . These practices almost invariably contain an element of the magical or the supernatural , and so far as they do they are allied to the class of traits we have just reviewed as being apparently characteristic of cultural retardation . But they contain also a second element , toward which cultures that have once abandoned such practices react with aversion , disgust , revulsion , or the shame of bad taste . This other element has as its common denominator what strikes us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of physiological happenings , including blood and death and decay , which we tend to regard as matters best kept private and unemphasized , and their public obtrusion as unpleasant and useless . Deformation of the head by pressure , filing or knockingout of the teeth , pattern scarifications , distention of lips and ear lobes and other anatomical mutilations , can perhaps be included here because they also have to do with the human body and tend to arouse shock or disgust in us ; though mostly they affect anatomy rather than physiology and sometimes have little or no magical motivation . At any rate , they constitute a set of folkways allied to the class we are considering . It is true that our fashions have developed strange  | coiffures , cosmetics , corsets , and such , but they lack the element of permanent bodily defacement , of mutilation . ' All in all , retarded cultures seem infantile both in their unabashed preoccupation with bodily functions and in their disregard of other human lives as compared with the gratifications of the ego . In this sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence their unwillingness to interest themselves in personal physiology , but their concern about humaneness . The latter is manifest also in trends like those of opposition to slavery , torture as a judicial procedure , beatings as legal punishment , execution with torture , slaughter of prisoners of war . While , apart from deformatory practices , the primitive folkways enumerated almost always have ritual approval or supernaturalistic association , it is equally significant that the advanced " universal " or world religions , Buddhism and Mohammedanism as well as Christianity , have consistently and positively thrown their weight on the prohumane and anti-infantile side . In other words , what primitive religion approves or enjoins in this field , civilized religion forbids . This suggests that the role of religion is secondary in these matters : it tends to fortify such standards of decency , humanity , cleanliness , and propriety as each culture has attained or only partly attained . It sanctions the mores more than it causes them . The present class of criteria of progress , then , consisting of adult attitudes toward physiological function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be only indirectly contributory , accordingly differs from the class discussed in the last section , in which the animistic and surrealistic element is basic and essential . Of course , we are dealing here with exceedingly broad trends or drifts , which can not be uniform in particulars . Retarded cultures form an enormous class , advanced ones another , and there is bound to be a deal of variation in each . For instance , the Eskimo , as nonliterate , nonmetallurgical hunters , are always reckoned as primitives . In fact it was long fashionable to begin the scale of civilization with Australians , Bushmen , Negritos , and Eskimo at the lower end . Yet the Eskimo do not possess in very emphatic form any custom of the class now being discussed , and lack some of them altogether . Judged by this criterion alone , Eskimo culture would have to be rated as more advanced than some high civilizations ? possibly that of much of India . In short , what we are dealing with is not a handy yardstick , but a probability tendency that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the North American Indians , the Western ones were particularly 7 Chinese foot-binding seems to be the only case of serious mutilation practiced in a great recent civilization . Ear-piercing and circumcision are after all anatomically negligible . Foot-binding is rather a special phenomenon . It is consciously erotic with a tingeing of the perverse to the point of making overt discussion of its motivation taboo ; and its disabling effect limited the practice to certain economic classes .  | obsessed by notions of contamination through birth , menstruation , and death . The Eastern tribes took these fears more lightly , but , here and there at least , went in for retainer burial and human sacrifice , ossuaries and reburial , and scalping as perhaps a partial equivalent of head-hunting . But the total trend of development in the area and the era of the great religions is unmistakable . The way in which the blood sacrifice of the ancient Mediterranean peoples , and of South and East Asiatic ones , is perpetuated among marginal primitives is discussed in ? 165 , 192 , and 238 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive as sacrifices and feasts of water buffalo , chickens , and palm wine among the pagan Igorot of the Philippines and in West African Dahomey . In China , ritual bloodshed and funerary deposit of valuables have long since been replaced by offerings of symbolic paper figures . In Japan , more distant from the advanced center , retainer burial went on until the early centuries of our era , when it was replaced , on avowed grounds of humanity , by pottery imitations of the living retainers . Leviticus , one of the later books of the Old Testament in date , is still full of blood sacrifice . " Whatsoever man of Israel that killeth an ox or lamb or goat .. . and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle , to offer an offering unto the Lord . . . blood shall be imputed to that man . . . he shall be cut off from among his people . . . . And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord . . . and burn the fat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices were still in full blast when Titus destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70 . They did not differ , save in deity worshiped and place and detail of manner , from the sacrifices that Titus and his pagan Romans made . Graeco-Roman paganism died out ; Judaism lived ; but , after the obliteration of the Temple in Jerusalem , sacrifices quietly dropped off from Jewish cult : they were becoming contrary to the spirit and attitudes of the times . Since more than a thousand years ago the most orthodox Jews no more think of slaughtering animals on the altars of their synagogues than do Christians in their churches . A tacit dropping of this part of their law was no doubt a condition of their being able to survive at all within the pale of civilization . The first great religion to break resolutely with all the ancient ritual obsession on physiology was Buddhism . ' One of its cardinal injunctions is against the killing of animals , even for food . This was part of its fundamental revolt against its parent , Vedic Brahmanism , in which sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jesus seems never to have sacrificed on the altar nor to have mentioned such sacrifice ; and therewith it was tacitly , but decisively , 8 Leviticus 17 : 3-6 . For more on blood and burnt offerings , see Leviticus , Chaps . 1 9 ; for defilement and purification from childbirth see Chap . 12 ; menstruation , Chap . 15 ; death , Chap . 21 . ? Jainism did so equally , is coeval , and still living ; but it became an Indian sect instead of a world religion .  | eliminated from Christianity.YO Six centuries later still , Mohammedanism followed suit completely . Even the minor religions and hybrid sects of the period , such as Manichaeism , discarded the practice . The one exception was Mithraism , which stressed not only the sacrifice of a bull but baptism in its gushing blood . Mithraism , an offshoot of Persian Mazdaism , began earlier than Christianity , which is perhaps why it retained the blood feature . Up to the third century after Christ , it still competed with Christianity , but it weakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and died without trace or survival : it was literally too raw for its times in the civilized parts of the world . Illustrations could be multiplied , but these examples may suffice . Finally , there is a third way in which the idea of progress in culture can be justified by objective evidence . This is in technology , mechanics , and science , whose accomplishments have definitely more cumulative quality than other civilizational activities . It is true that high scientific productivity appears to come in bursts or pulses as definitely as art ( ? 136 ) . But there is the difference that each art , or for that matter each philosophy or religion , very largely has to begin all over again , whereas each of the intermittent periods of discovery in science can begin , and generally does begin , just about where the last one left off . Science , and in the main technology , are evidently accumulative by nature , while philosophy , religion , art ? and empire and nationalism too ? tend strongly to be substitutive : a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or scientific achievements have been made , they are likely to be retained , even through long sterile intervals , until there is a new flashing-up of inventions . A pulley or a water wheel , geometry and the laws of the lever , do not usually get themselves wholly forgotten or abandoned , even in times of wrack and misery . There may be lost mechanical arts or lost branches of science ; but they are certainly neither numerous nor important , as will appear in a following chapter ( ? 156-16o ) . Here then is a third manner of progress of civilization . But with it we are back largely among aspects that are quantitative ? like growth in population , growth in size of states and nations , growth sometimes in the number and complexity of their political subdivisions . Similar perhaps also is growth in stocks of wealth ? more gold , diamonds , farmed acres , houses in the world : part at least of the old are physically preserved , and new ones added . But we have already seen that there is serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be legitimately construed as progress . Size is easy to boast about , but does it bring with it wiser living or greater happiness ? Only so far as it does can quantitative increase of culture be considered as making for progress . ru The only mentions of sacrifice or offering in the New Testament , other than references to Jewish and pagan sacrifice , are symbolic : as when St. Paul says that Jesus " appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself " ( Hebrews g : 26 ) ; or the " blood of the Lamb " in Revelation .  | In summary , the quantitative expansion of the content of total human culture ; the atrophy of magic based on psychopathology ; the decline of infantile obsession with the outstanding physiological events of human life ; and the persistent tendency of technology and science to grow accumulatively ? these are the ways in which progress may legitimately be considered a property or an attribute of culture . They are the residuum supported by fact when the emotional and aprioristic idea of a continuous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be found on this in the discussion of cultural losses already cited . And of course the folk-sophisticate polarity considered in ? 121 partly overlaps with the idea of progress . I29 . FUNCTION Function has been increasingly dealt with in cultural anthropology , as in other branches of study and science , in recent years . The basic meaning of " function " is activity or operation that is natural , proper , or characteristic , such as " secretion of bile and storage of sugar are functions of the liver . " From this there is a shading into the popular meaning of purpose : such as the function of a broom is to sweep . Between is a whole series of vague and elusive meanings ; consult any unabridged dictionary in confirmation . Through most of these meanings runs the idea of a relationship that is active but not causal . Linton has tried to clarify these variable concepts by distinguishing form , meaning , use , and function in culture . The form of a culture trait or complex is what can be perceived by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjective associations in the culture , implicit and explicit . Its use is its relation to things outside the society and culture , as expressible in physical terms ; its function is its relation within the society and culture . For instance , the form of an ax comprises the blade and the handle , the curve of the bit , the steel of which it is made . It is this sensory aspect of a trait or complex that obviously passes or diffuses most readily from one culture to another . The use of an ax , according to Linton , is to chop wood ; its function , to keep members of the society warm by providing fuel , and to make carpentry possible by providing logs . It is evident that if consideration of purpose has not already crept into the statement of use and function here , it is not far distant . As to the meaning of an ax , while Linton does not expatiate on this , it is evident that this is variable , not only between different cultures , but according to context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household and a vocational tool , but a weapon and the instrument 11 Obviously , " form " as used here is that aspect of the elements of culture which has to do with their sensory appearance ; whereas in ? 125 " form " means the organization of the contents of a whole culture . A more discriminating terminology will presumably come into usage someday ? perhaps " appearance " for I , inton 's " form , " and " organization " for the form that is contrasted with content . At present , the context will usually leave no doubt as to which meaning is intended .  | of the executioner . In the primitive parts of southeastern Asia and the East Indies , it has powerful meaning in connection with head-hunting . In ancient Rome , in Fascist Italy , in Republican France , the lictor 's ax , in conjunction with the bundle of rods or fasces , is a well-known symbol of punishment , and therefore of governmental authority . In ancient Crete , the double-bitted ax or labrys was a sign of divinity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and polished stone have meant wealth or treasure to people emerging out of primitiveness , in ancient Greece and elsewhere . The form of a ballot would comprise its material , size , shape , columns , arrangement of offices and candidates . Its meaning might be said to be popular freedom and sovereignty ; its use , to elect officials ; its functions , democratic and representative . A song would have its form given by its melody and rhythm : it is a succession of particular notes . The meaning or association would be patriotic , sentimental , or religious according as the song was " The Star-spangled Banner , " a blues , or a hymn . The use would similarly vary from opening a patriotic meeting , entertainment at a night club , or conduct of a church service . In fact , the national anthem has repeatedly been used to prevent incipient riots by compelling everyone to stand still at attention . The function of songs is , as usual , the vaguest aspect : to strengthen patriotism , make a drink more enjoyable , further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized as to its form ? or its substance too , if one will ? by silence , looking aside , moving away . Its obvious use is to prevent contact between in-laws of opposite sex and different generation . The meaning is , according to the usual testimony of those who practice the custom , an expression of respect , or conversely of shame if the respect were violated by familiarity . The function is usually believed to be avoidance or easement of social strain . However , it is well to observe that this functional relation is one-way : wherever the custom obtains , relief from strain is likely to be its function ; but where it is not customary , its practice would immediately cause strain , of much the same kind and strength as would result from nonobservance of the custom where it is mandatory . Opposites can therefore fulfill the same function in different cultures , or in different situations . So can wholly diverse acts : making a gift , inviting to a meal , speaking politely or flatteringly , or tabooing one 's mother-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be defined as a ring of floral elements , either worn on the head or hung . We use bridal , funeral , and Christmas wreaths , whose connotations and meanings are certainly even more diverse than their materials or colors . Not so long ago , in Eurore , the bridal wreath was definitely a prized symbol of virginity . The ancients wore chaplets or floral wreaths as a party dress , and hung them on sacrificial victims . They also gave laurel wreaths as honors , and called them crowns when they were imitated in gold . For wreaths , meaning and use are evidently pretty much coextensive . And the function of wreaths ?  | Can we say much more than that it is to express by a visible symbol an emotion of joy or sorrow appropriate to a given situation ? But one might also wonder whether such a statement means anything more than that wreaths , like a hundred other kinds of things , serve as symbols of feelings . It is evident from these examples that the function of a cultural act or trait differs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these three all reside in the culture , but the function is something we read into the culture . The " meaning " of a trait may be literally " subjective , " as that of a mourning wreath , or of " The Star-spangled Banner " ; but everybody in the culture is agreed on it , so that the fact of the meaning can be ascertained objectively . Indeed many of us are none too sure of the whole tune or words of the American national anthem ? that is , we often do not securely control its " form " ? but no one doubts that its significance is patriotic . Similarly , we all know what a black or white wreath hung by the front door means , though many of us might be somewhat hazy as to the material it was made of , or wonder whether the " use " might be to express respect , to give warning that a corpse lay in the house , or to keep tradesmen and solicitors away . Still , everyone in the society is at least roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something that the student or analyst of culture finds out about . Function is an interpretation , something in his mind , which he attributes to a culture ; but the form , use , and meaning of artifacts and institutions are actually part of the culture . This is not so different , in one way , from the role of physiology . A healthy body functions without awareness . True perception of physiologic function is the result of dissection , observation , test , experiment , and the laboratory . Even some highly civilized peoples have been quite random in distinguishing nerves and veins , let alone veins from arteries , and have variously associated emotions , feelings , and thought with the bowels , the liver , the heart , or the brain . The difference between physiological function and cultural function is that the physiologist has his laboratory and can experiment , and the student of culture has not this advantage . In many cases he can only guess as to function ? as the Greek , mediaeval , and Chinese physicians largely used to guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture accordingly tend to contain a maximum of theory , interpretation , or opinion , often based on a relatively narrow selection of facts seen as significant . Their value as well as their weakness lies in this point . 130 . PURPOSE AND NEED At bottom , much of the preoccupation of anthropologists with cultural function seems to boil down to two things : concern with purpose , and concern with integration . Integration has already been considered ( ? 122 ) . It remains to consider purpose ; or , as it is more fashionable to disguise it : need .  | Preoccupation with purpose appears for one thing to be due to the fact that there are many cultural beliefs and institutions which serve no visible utility , Dr at least no utility that could not equally well be attained by other means , and which are adhered to merely because they are customary and " right , " like the mother-in-law taboo just discussed ; or which are destructive and unprofitable , like most war . Why are there exogamic groupings ? Why are these often totemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a group , but perhaps enjoined in special cases ? Why are uncles called fathers by many peoples ? Why are adolescents initiated into the sacred mysteries of adults , where they learn that apparent spirits or gods are only disguised fellow tribesmen ? Why does a Yurok not eat in a canoe while it floats on the ocean ? To All these questions there is no obvious answer of the sort of answer there is to why an arrow is feathered or what use a fish net has . Moreover , the practices sited are all limited to certain societies and do not occur in others , including our awn . Accordingly , the practices can not correspond to any universal need , bodily , emotional , or social ; at any rate , not to any real or objective universal need . A native may think his baby will die if he does not observe the couvade taboo restrictions ( ? 225 ) . But since the babies of non-couvading peoples also live and these nations manage to multiply , the quite genuine problem remains for the reflective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or purpose subserved , by people 's believing in the necessity of the couvade ? Or for that matter , in the necessity of clans , totems , initiations , taboos , and all the rest . The simplest and soundest answer is that the need , good , use , or purpose is often imaginary ; that a lot of culture is irrational , and that collectively human minds are as full of aberrations as individual minds ? or fuller . But most of these irrationalities are harmless , or at least not destructive . It may bore a man , or be inconvenient to him , to lie around the house inactive for days after his baby is born . But he has the compensating satisfaction of believing that he has strengthened the child 's life ; and there will normally be brothers or friends around to see that the needed household and living chores get done . What we call the more primitive cultures are full of such extravagances , of strange , unpredictable , exotic doings ; variable , and suggestive of the habits of children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged with emotion , but quite unreasonable ; often vehemently backed by the mores or ethical sentiments of society . Quite likely our civilization has its share of counterparts , which we can not segregate off from the more practical remainder of the business of living because we are engulfed in this civilization of ours as we are in the air we breathe . Some centuries may be needed before the full recognition of our own nonrational couvades and totems and taboos becomes possible . Obviously , it is going to be very difficult to explain all these extravagances and absurdities on the basis of any coherent system of specific needs that they satisfy or purposes which they serve . The phenomena are too variable , the presumable motivations too diverse . Some nations follow the couvade , some do not ;  | some set up social groups to forbid intermarriage , some merely specify the forbidden kindred . Certain of the practices seem actuated by fear or lack of assurance , others by hope of a positive gain or reward ; still others may spring from restlessness , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or they may have originated from one of these motivations in a particular , transient situation ; but the situation having passed , the practice continues to be followed ? without motivation , or with a new one . It is plain that any general explanation of phenomena as variable as these is bound to be thin , commonplace , and trite ; it can be vivid and satisfying only as it is particular and special . For instance , let us consider one of the most widespread of these " aberrations , " the belief in and practice of magic . No culture has been free of it ; in no two cultures has it been identical . An older view , that of Frazer , sees in magic an impersonal counterpart of religion , a sort of applied pseudo-science that deals with cause-and-effect relations ; the supposed causal relations are untrue , but they contain a logic , in that , like the cause and effect of our science , they recognize and deal with similarities and with proximities or contacts . A later interpretation by Malinowski construes magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world beyond control : we invent a control , however fictitious , to reassure ourselves and make living more endurable . Incidentally , the two interpretations are not contradictory ; they differ in emphasis rather than in being exclusive . Malinowski goes on to assert that where people feel competent in a situation , they tend not to invoke magic . Pacific islanders fish inside the lagoon without bothering with spells , charms , and amulets ; these are reserved for fishing beyond the reef , where boats can founder or be blown away , where sharks bite , and the surf pounds , where the prizes as well as the risks are greater . This explanation may hold for some Pacific peoples but it is not a universally valid principle . In that event the Eskimo , who have to contend with far greater dangers from ice , currents , waves , drowning , freezing , and starving than the Melanesians , ought to make much more use of magic than the Melanesians ; whereas , in point of fact , they use it less . They are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They may make magic for a whale ; they do so occasionally for seals if these leave them altogether in the lurch ; perhaps never for fish . One might pick up the point of self-reliance and say that it is precisely there that the Eskimo broke loose from magic , relatively speaking : that their subsistence problems were so tough that no bolstering of their courage with magic would have sufficed for their survival . They had to find techniques that actually killed the seal and brought the hunter back alive , or perish ; and with such techniques , they became self-reliant , and discarded much of their magic . But with this concession , the explanation by need is weakened . Magic is no longer a regular response to an automatic human need for assurance ( ? 250 ) . This need is itself a variable , dependent on degree of technological invention , and perhaps on other factors as well . Contact with a new people may result in the learning of new weapons , tools , or techniques , increased competence and  | self-assurance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new people is certainly among what we call the accidents of history ; and if such accidents can influence the amount or kind of magic or animism practiced , it is plain that the explanation of magic as a function of a constant and imperative need , universally intrinsic to the human psyche , pretty much falls to pieces . Of similar import is the fact that , in the same Pacific Ocean , Polynesians are on the whole less magic-ridden than Melanesians ; and among Polynesians the Samoans are described as taking their animism with comparative lightness ( ? 250 ) , and the Hawaiians as having been bored with their religion to the point of wanting to discard it ( ? 168 ) . Here we are within the range of almost identical environments and therefore presumably very similar needs and problems . Another irregularity is furnished by the Yurok and the Karok of native California . These tribes lived in a climate of no rigors , on a river that gave them abundance of salmon , in a land full of acorns that were their staple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Their food supply was greater and their population denser than in most of California , yet they had hedged themselves in with a thousand do 's and don't 's of magic . You did n't drink river water because it might have been poisoned , nor drink in strange places ; you did n't eat in a boat on the ocean , nor on the river-mouth spit , nor before going hunting or doing the day 's heavy work . You did not eat deer and whale meat at the same time , nor bear meat and salmon . After eating venison , it was obligatory to wash your hands , but in a basket , not in a stream . You might sleep with your wife in the brush or in a camp , but not in your house , else your shell money took offense and left you . Your bow had to be made from that side of a yew tree which faced away from the river . And so on ad infinitum . Yet need can not be invoked as cause , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taboo system of the Yurok and the Karok is due to an orientation of the culture that has nothing to do with any necessities or actual problems . For some unknown reason the culture just had gone hypochondriac , and all members of the society , whatever their congenital individual dispositions , had fear and pessimism pounded into them from childhood on . ' They were taught by all their elders that the world simply reeked with evils and dangers , against which one sought protection by an endless series of preventive taboos and magical practices . ( See also ? 253 . ) We must conclude , accordingly , that there is no relation of simple function between specific organic needs rooted in the body and the mind or in the en12 One might also try to explain such pervasive timidity by frequency of social fears or interpersonal strains . The Yurok had a good many person-to-person quarrels and enmities , but few class or communal clashes . It is difficult to say whether they experienced more social strain than tribes of courageous and optimistic outlook , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tense , hypochondriac disposition that leads to clashes with people , or is it actual enmities which make a people hypochondriac even toward nature ? It would be hard to say . In most cases of this type , the causality tends to be circular : each effect tends to become a reinforcing cause .  | vironment of man on the one hand , and his cultural activities , such as magic , on the other hand . Whether it be magic or art , mythology or elaboration of social structure , or what not , cultural activities differ so much , from people to people and from period to period , in their strength and in the forms assumed , that it is impossible to derive these activities from , or even to relate them rigorously to , any intrinsic organic necessities , which must in their nature be far more constant . Of course , organic factors are always present and operative . But as soon as we have culture at all , another set of factors also becomes operative : ideas , beliefs , and the practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no subhuman animal shows . And these factors being highly variable , their expression in specific but unstable cultural traits and complexes must be variable and complex , with considerable play or give-and-take . The most immediate functional relations of cultural phenomena are to cultural variables and epiphenomena , not to organic constants such as physiological necessities or psychobiological imperatives .  | PATTERNS are those arrangements or systems of internal relationship which give to any culture its coherence or plan , and keep it from being a mere accumulation of random bits . They are therefore of primary importance . However , the concepts embraced under the term " pattern " are still a bit fluid ; the ideas involved have not yet crystallized into sharp meanings . It will therefore be necessary to consider in order several kinds of patterns . We may call these provisionally the universal , the systemic , the societal or whole-culture , and the style type of patterns . 131 . THE UNIVERSAL PATTERN The universal pattern was proposed by Wissler , with the alternative designation of " the culture scheme . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultures . It is therefore fundamentally different from the other kinds of pattern , since these all apply either to particular cultures or only to parts of cultures . The universal pattern consists of a series of nine heads under which all the facts of any culture may be comprehended . The nine heads are : Speech , Material Traits , Art , Knowledge ( " mythological " as well as " scientific " ) , Religion , Society , Property , Government , and War . These subdivide further , as desirable . Thus under Society , Wissler suggests marriage , kinship , inheritance , control , and games ; under Material Traits , food , shelter , transport , dress , utensils , weapons , and industries ; Government is divided into political forms and legal procedures . It is apparent at once that this universal pattern with its heads and subheads is like a table of contents in a book . It guides us around within the volume rather than giving us the essence or quality of it . Except for minor variations ,  | the universal pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most books descriptive of a culture , such as a standard ethnographic report on a tribe . The main heads are conventional captions for those classes of facts which common sense and common experience lead us to expect to be represented in every culture . We know of no people without speech , food habits , artifacts , property , religion , society , and so on . We can say therefore that these captions represent a sort of common denominators found in all cultures , and that the universal pattern consists merely of the series of these common denominators expectably represented in any culture ? represented perhaps very variably but represented somehow . It is evident that the greater the range of cultures considered , and the more diverse these are , the more will the universal elements or common denominators shrink or become vague . The proportion of universal or common traits in the total range becomes less and less as this total grows more diverse , while at the same time the concepts corresponding to the captions have to be increasingly stretched to accommodate the facts or traits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurred out . The Yurok , and again the Ifugao , have a highly intricate legal system , but a minimum of political institutions ? in fact it might be argued whether they properly have any . This is certainly an interesting situation in that it differs so radically from our own culture , where not only both law and government are highly developed but law is made to depend on government or to derive from it . This characterizing distinction , which is obviously significant for the understanding of Yurok or Ifugao culture , and almost certainly significant also for understanding our own culture better ? this and similar distinctions are lost in the degree that one does one 's describing in terms of the common denominators of the universal pattern . This universal pattern thus boils down to a rough plan of convenience for a preliminary ordering of facts awaiting description or interpretation . No one seems to have developed the idea since it was set forth in 1923 , or to have made serious use of it toward deeper understanding . We will therefore pass on to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of pattern consists of a system or complex of cultural material that has proved its utility as a system and therefore tends to cohere and persist as a unit ; it is modifiable superficially , but modifiable only with difficulty as to its underlying plan . Any one such systemic pattern is limited primarily to one aspect of culture , such as subsistence , religion , or economics ; but it is not limited areally , or to one particular culture ; it can be diffused crossculturally , from one people to another . Examples are plow agriculture , monotheism , the alphabet , and , on a smaller scale , the kula ring of economic exchange among the Massim Melanesians . What distinguishes these systemic patterns of  | culture ? or well-patterned systems , as they might also be called ? is a specific interrelation of their component parts , a nexus that holds them together strongly , and tends to preserve the basic plan . This is in distinction to the great " loose " mass of material in every culture that is not bound together by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result of the persistence of these systemic patterns , their significance becomes most evident on a historical view . As we mentally roam over the world or down the centuries , what is impressive about these systemic patterns is the point-for-point correspondence of their parts , plus the fact that all variants of the pattern can be traced back to a single original form . The alphabet is an example . Its history and variations are set forth in ? 206-221 . But we may anticipate here by pointing out that the alphabet was invented only once , by a Semitic people in southwestern Asia previous to moo B.C. ; that it operates on the principle of a letter symbol for each minimal acoustic element of speech ; that the letters for most sounds in any form of alphabet , no matter how specialized , always resemble the letters in some other alphabet , and through that , or still others , they resemble and are derived from the letters of the original alphabet ; and that for the most part the order and often the names of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evident where and why they were altered . Thus Hebrew aleph , beth , gimel , daleth , correspond in sound , order , and name to Greek alpha , beta , gamma , delta , and to Roman and our A , B , C , D. The pattern of plow agriculture comprises the plow itself ; animals to draw it ; domestication of these beasts ; grains of the barley or wheat type sown by broadcast scattering , without attention to the individual seed , seedling , or plant ; fields larger than gardens and of some length ; and fertilization with dung , primarily from the draft animals . This system originated in the Neolithic period , probably in western Asia or near it , and by A.D. 1500 had spread from Morocco to North China ? since then to the Americas and Australia as well . There are two other and parallel systems , both without plows originally : the rice and maize types of agriculture . The former involves small fields flooded by nature or irrigation , hand planting of seedlings and hand weeding ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly utilized in the rice-growing , though the buffalo is now put before the plow in some areas . This rice pattern began as a hoe-and-garden culture and still largely is such . Native American agriculture , centering around maize , also did not attempt to use the available domestic animals ? llamas in the Andes ? and therefore was also hoe farming , or even digging-stick farming . The planting was done in hillocks . Irrigation and fertilizing were practiced locally and seem to have been secondary additions . The plants grown in addition to maize were , with the exception of cotton , wholly unrepresented in the plow or rice patterns . The histories of the three systems have retrained essentially as separate as their origins , except for some relatively  | recent transfers of draft animals and plows from the plow pattern into the two others where these began to be drawn into modern international , metropolitan civilization . The exclusive-monotheistic pattern is **27;487;TOOLONG . The three religions are outgrowths of one another and originated in a small area of southwestern Asia . The pattern comprises a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others ; so far as there are other spiritual beings , such as angels or saints , they are derivative from him ; the deity is proclaimed by a particular human vessel inspired by the deity ; and worship according to this revelation excludes and forbids any other worship . Cults and philosophies outside these three organized monotheisms have repeatedly attained to monotheism , or to a pantheism or a henotheism that would be hard to distinguish logically from monotheism . And many religions , even of backward peoples , recognize a supreme deity . But all these others regularly lack some of the features of the exclusive-monotheistic pattern , and their resemblances are thus only partial convergences of an analogical type . This merely analogical similarity of these " high-god " and miscellanously monotheistic religions goes hand in hand with their diversity of origin : they are not connected with the exclusive monotheisms , nor for the most part with one another . By contrast , the three exclusive monotheisms are homologous ? structurally or part-for-part similar ? and they are connected in origin : Jesus was a Jew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The systemic type of pattern accordingly not only partakes of the quality of a system , but is a specific growth . It originates in one culture , is capable of spread and transplantation to others , and tends strongly to persist once it is established . It recalls the basic patterns of structure common to groups of related animals developed from a common origin , with the original pattern persisting through all superficial modifications as they occur under evolution . For instance , the basic vertebrate pattern includes a skull with lower jaw , vertebrate column , and , above the level of the fishes , two pairs of limbs each ending in five digits . Within the range of this pattern , there is endless variation . A snake has no legs , whales and some reptiles and amphibians possess only one pair . Birds have converted the front pair into wings ; seals , into flippers ; and moles , into " shovels . " The digits carry claws in carnivores , hoofs in running mammals , nails in ourselves . They number five in man as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pigs , three in the emu , two in the ostrich and the cow , one only in the horse ? not counting nonfunctioning vestiges . Not one of the thousand of species of amphibians , reptiles , birds , or mammals ever possesses more than two pairs of limbs or more than five digits ; any six-fingered vertebrate is an individual malformation . By contrast there are the arthropods , among whom the higher crustaceans have five pairs of legs ( modifiable to claws or paddles ) , the spiders four , and the insects three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings ; but none of the hundreds  | of thousands of species of arthropods ever show a five-digited limb . Such are the basic arthropod plans , which are endlessly modified according to order , family , and species . Thus many butterflies have only two pairs of legs ; bees have two pairs of wings , but the related ants break theirs off after mating ; flies have only one pair ; beetles have two pairs but fly mainly with one , the other having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleas , lice , and many others have long since become wingless . We might add that all arthropods have definitely segmented bodies , a skeleton on the outside , antennae , and pale bluish blood containing copper-protein haemocyanin , as compared with the nonsegmentation , inner skeleton , lack of antennae , and blood reddened by the ironprotein haemoglobin of all vertebrates . It is true that these fundamental plans of structure of the subkingdoms of life such as the arthropods and the vertebrates , or of their classes like insects and mammals , constitute something very much bigger than the system patterns of culture . They are hundreds of millions of years old , expressed in thousands to hundreds of thousands of species and in trillions upon trillions of individuals . The culture patterns muster an age of only a few thousand years . Once established , the great biological patterns predetermine , as it were , the main frames within which evolution will operate . No arthropod can give rise to a vertebrate , or vice versa ; their patterns are separated by profound , unbridgeable clefts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? strictly speaking , between their subchasms . By contrast , cultural system patterns , such as exclusive monotheism , plow agriculture , the alphabet , pass from one race or society , from one major culture , to another , and rather freely . Each year men who otherwise remain in their ancestral culture are for the first time learning to plow , to read letters , to fixate on a single God . Such a transfer of pattern to new kinds of carriers is of course impossible in subhuman organisms , whose forms are dominated by irreversible heredity . But the transfer is characteristic of the very nature of culture , which is plastic , reversible , and capable of unlimited absorptions , anastotnosings , and fusions . Hence the patterns within cultures impress us as shifting and often transient . They are so , in comparison with the grand patterns of organic life , just as everything cultural , being an epiphenomenon , something superadded to life , is relatively unstable , modifiable , and adaptable . What the present type of cultural pattern system shares with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , in the repeated expressions of which , no matter how varied , there nevertheless is traceable a part-for-part correspondence , which allows each form or expression to be recognized as related to the others and derived from the plan as it originally took shape . In fact , the peculiar interest of these systemic patterns is that , within the endless kaleidoscope of human culture , they allow us to recognize things that are actually related in origin as against things that appear similar but are not connected in origin . The patterns differentiate homologies from analogies , the  | biologist would say . Thus , the several examples of exclusive monotheism are both homologous and historically interconnected through derivation of one from the other . But the Chinese Heaven , the Indian Brahma , the Egyptian Aten , " god " in the abstract of the Greek philosophers , the supreme deities of many primitive religions , represent analogies or convergences . They are distinct , separate developments which led to results that seem similar . And so , Egyptian hieroglyphs , Mesopotamian cuneiform , Indus Valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , and the surviving Chinese system ( ? 2o2-2o5 ) are like alphabets in that they function as more or less effective methods of visible-speech communication . But they are like them only in that functioning . All alphabets are genetically one ? derived from a single source ; the other methods of writing have separate sources , operate on different principles , are built on different plans . They resemble alphabets as a whale does a fish ? both communicate or swim ? but without genuine similarity of structure or meaningful relationship . But alphabet resembles alphabet as whale and porpoise and dolphin resemble one another . It is in the working-out of these real relationships , structural and genetic relationships as against mere functional similarities , that the recognition of culture patterns of the systemic type finds one of its chief uses . 133 . TOTAL-CULTURE PATTERNS Next , there are patterns that relate to whole cultures . There is an Italian , a French , a British pattern or form of European civilization . There is an Iroquoian , Algonkin , and Siouan aspect or facies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn has its own larger total pattern , which , together with the Southeastern , Southwestern , North Pacific Coast , Mexican , and other patterns make up the still larger native North American pattern ( ? 326 ) . It is evident that we are here dealing with culture wholes , not , as in the last section , with specific complexes or systems that form only part of any one culture but can be grafted onto others . East is East and West is West , Kipling said in vivid allusiveness to the different physiognomies or qualities of Occidental and Asiatic civilizations . When he added that never the twain shall meet , he was technically overstating things , in that civilizations do borrow and learn from each other , do assimilate or " acculturate " ? which fact he was perfectly aware of when he went on : " But there is neither East nor West , Border , nor Breed , nor Birth , when two strong men stand face to face . " But the " never-meeting " is also a poetical way of saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , and perhaps of implying that the sets or trends of civilizations as wholes vary profoundly , quite apart from the sum total of the items which make up their content . Civilizations differ in " configuration , " in modern scientific jargon ; " spirit " would have been an earlier word , " genius " before that .  | There is of course nothing new in the fact that civilizations are distinct . Innumerable items can always be cited , either of differential or of likeness . To engage a button , we cut a slit in the cloth ; the Chinese sew on a loop ; and so on . But what do a hundred or a thousand or ten thousand such items mean ? What do they add up to that is of wider import or deeper significance ? If the items just scatter with equal randomness in two or more cultures , their effect will be equivalent , in spite of the endless variation of detail . Obviously , the specific items must concentrate in some peculiar way in each civilization , must gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a larger meaning . And therewith we have a pattern or configuration . There remains a difficulty , however . Items like buttonholes are definite and are readily ascertained or established , but their significance is limited . The pattern or physiognomy or trend of a great civilization is certainly an important thing to know , but it is difficult to formulate accurately and reliably . Such a pattern has in it breadth and complexity , depth and subtlety , universal features but also uniqueness . In proportion as the expression of such a large pattern tends to the abstract , it becomes arid and lifeless ; in proportion as it remains attached to concrete facts , it lacks generalization . Perhaps the most vivid and impressive characterizations have been made by frank intuition deployed on a rich body of knowledge and put into skillful words . Yet this does not constitute proof and is at best at the fringe of the approved methods of science and scholarship . These difficulties will explain why the formulation of whole-culture patterns has not progressed farther , though it is surely one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . A spirited depiction of the total pattern of any culture possesses much the same appeal and interest as a portrait by a good painter . Some cultures , like some faces , are more interesting than others , but all can be given an interest and meaning by the hand of the skilled master . This gift of " seizing " character , with its suffusion by insight , admittedly partakes as much of the faculties of the artist as of those of the scientist . Excellent delineations of culture patterns have in fact been presented by nonanthropologists , by historians and travelers . More than eighteen hundred years ago Tacitus gave to posterity one of the masterpieces of this genre in his analysis of German custom and character . So keen was his penetration that many qualities of his subjects are still recognizable in the Germans of today . Other notable examples are the mediaeval Persian Al-Biruni writing in Arabic on Indian civilization ; and in the nineteenth century , Burckhardt 's Renaissance , Doughty 's Arabia Deserta , Codrington 's Melanesians . The first was a historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionary bishop . At the risk of making invidious distinctions , Malinowski , Benedict , Mead , Evans-Pritchard , might be cited among recent avowed anthropologists . Through the medium of fiction , Pierre Loti , Freuchen 's Eskimo , Maran 's Batottala , and Mofolo 's Chaka have done something similar with ex. cecding vividness.  | A requisite for the recognition of the whole-culture type of pattern , besides of course insight and articulateness , is willingness to see a culture in terms of itself , of its own structure , values , and style . There must be an interest in the culture for its own sake . Without this , the depiction tends to degenerate into a recital of oddments , or of those features in which the culture 's standards differ from our own ? to its own worsening , of course . The disengagement from the biases and values of the describer 's own culture should be complete , at least for the time being . Such preconceptions should never block his sympathies for the culture he is describing , where its qualities call for sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but an appraisal of what the culture 's own standards and valuations are , and how far they are adhered to . This process is akin to recognition of style in art ; to " appreciation " in the stricter sense of that word , before it acquired its popular meaning of mere liking . There too we do not judge Michelangelo by the standard of Rodin , or Mozart by that of Shostakovich ; nor , for that matter , Shostakovich by the values of Mozart , though unconsciously that is what conservatives may tend to do . What is in question in such endeavors is the recognition of the art of a certain region and period as expressed by its best exponents , the evaluation of how far it achieved its aims , and the definition of what these aims and values were . Attempts to recognize and define whole-culture patterns are of the same kind , but are larger in that they try to grasp the totality of styles ? the nexus of social , ethical , intellectual , and economic as well as aesthetic styles or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' 134 . EXEMPLIFICATIONS IN LANGUAGE As so often , language , which is one specialized part of culture , can be used advantageously here to illustrate the total cultural situation . An author 's style ? literally his " writing-rod " or pencil ? refers to his consistent ways or habitual manners of expressing himself distinctively enough to be recognizable from others . We have also superindividual styles , such as that of Elizabethan and of eighteenth-century English as compared with that of contemporary English . Going still farther , we may say there is a Latin style , an Anglo-Saxon style , a Germanic style , in English ; and beyond these , there are styles characteristic of the Latin , English , and German languages . These whole-language styles consist of more than degrees of elaborateness of sentence structure , or the posit Kluckhohn proposes to distinguish patterns from configurations . Both refer to structural regularities of culture . But to him patterns are objective and explicit ( " overt " ) , or readily brought into social consciousness , whereas configurations are implicit ( " covert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have to be dissected out by analysts of the culture . In part , though only in part , Kluckhohn 's " patterns " correspond to what are here called systemic patterns ( ? 132 ) , his " configurations " to total-culture and style patterns ( ? 133 , 137 )  | tion of the verb . By insensible degrees they involve the whole of what we ordinarily call the grammar of a language . Latin has six distinguishable cases , German four , and English two . Latin conjugates its verb by a long series of complex suffixes , whereas spoken English has only three living conjugating suffixes and performs its main business of conjugation by the equally effective mechanism of separate auxiliary words , as set forth in ? 97 , 109 . What are such grammatical peculiarities but crystallized stylistic idiosyncrasies ? The grammar of a language may be viewed as its total specific style compared with the styles of other languages , or as its total pattern of structure . It is true that what we ordinarily call " style " in language is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than what we ordinarily call " grammar , " and for many purposes it is desirable to observe the distinction . But there is no absolute line between the two , and both are ways or manners or patterns of expression . Just as the grammar of a language is its total pattern of fixed forms , so we might conceivably refer to the total pattern of a culture as its cultural grammar . That is not usage ; but the comparison may help clarify what we mean when we talk of total patterns . The trouble is that there is as yet no word in English , or in any other language , to express this concept except vague or metaphorical terms like " genius , " " spirit , " " style , " " trend , " " direction . " Comparison with language may also help clarify the difference between the systemic patterns ( ? 132 ) and the total-culture patterns ( ? 133 ) . Much as grammar corresponds to total pattern , so lexical content corresponds in one way to system pattern and to miscellaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are often borrowed by one language from another , as when English takes over Gestalt from German or chic from French , or thousands and thousands of earlier words from Latin or French or both ? all without the form or grammar or pattern of English being appreciably changed . Similarly , innumerable items or traits of cultural substance , such as corn-planting or seasoning with curry or voting on Australian ballots , can be taken over into a culture without its basic pattern or " grammar " being affected in principle . Moreover , we have seen cases of a system pattern such as the alphabet passing over into culture after culture but its various forms there being recognizable as derived from one common source by their part-for-part correspondence . Well , just as in the alphabet aleph , beth , gimel , correspond to A , B , C , and help prove their joint derivation , so in the relationship of language . English nose , tongue , two , three correspond to Spanish nariz , lengua , dos , tres , and to German nase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as meaning ; but none of them correspond to Japanese hana , hita , futa-tsu , mi-tsu in sound or form . Thereby these words help prove that English and Spanish and German speech have a common origin and relationship , which we call Indo-European , but that Japanese is outside the Indo-European origin and relationship . It is the parts or content of a system that can he used as evidence of this sort , and it is the parts or words or content  | of a language that can be used in the same way . Both kinds of content are receivable into larger entities ? culture wholes or language wholes ? without much affecting the forms or major patterns or styles or " grammars " of these . On the contrary , resemblances in style pattern mean much less as regards connective relationship . The Japanese language compounds nouns , piles up and encapsulates subordinate clauses , and then finishes up its elaborate periodic sentence with a verb , in much the way German speech style does . English word separateness and English syntax or word arrangement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is evident from this example that these grammatical , stylistic , or pattern resemblances can grow up in languages quite independently of their historical connection . Of the four just mentioned , English and German are the only two related . In fact they are closely and recently related in origin ; but both tie up in certain features of their style pattern with wholly unconnected languages at the far end of another continent . As a cultural counterpart one might mention the sharing by early Romans and by Chinese of addiction to patriarchal authority in the gens or extended family , the strong economic functioning of this group , the use of gentile or family names , the cult of manes or ancestral spirits , the relative meagerness of other ritual and mythology , the high premium on sobriety , piety , self-control , and moderation . All these pattern resemblances of orientation or outlook or physiognomy are certainly not due to any specific or direct historical connection of Rome and China , which these two countries never had . The pattern resemblances are evidently convergent or parallelistic ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originated independently , and therefore their similarity is secondary , functional , and analogous only . For instance , early Roman culture put , and Chinese does not put , strong emphasis on bravery , on military training and success , and on a martial tribal god . Again , the late Roman Empire , in its Byzantine phase long after the capital had been moved to Constantinople , shows interesting approximations to late Chinese civilization , say of the Ming and Manchu dynasties , roughly 1400 to 1900 . In both instances there are present : a sense of old and thorough saturation in high civilization , leading to self-satisfaction and disdain of the achievements of other cultures ; a competent and educated bureaucracy as the mainstay of the state and civilization ; fatigue as regards war , coupled with tried defensive skill ; a flagging of originality in the arts , science , and philosophy , side by side with real respect for learning and its quantitative reproduction in encyclopaedias , commentaries , and the like . Some of these shared trends may be the results of a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly occur except in cultures of some maturity . Nevertheless , whatever the causes at work , they do not include imitation influence of the one civilization on the other . And we have again a degree of physiognomic resemblance , of total-pattern similarity . And this is evidently analogous in kind to the patterning that makes the grammar of  | English ? and not of Latin , or Greek , be it noted ? more like that of Chinese in its general character than is that of any other European language . In summary , systemic patterns are blocks or pieces of culture or language sharing a content that is of common origin and is arranged in a common pattern persistent enough to be recognizable for a long time , even after direct historical record of the community of origin has been lost . ( In the case of language , the block may be so large as to comprise the majority of the vocabulary . ) Total-culture patterns are the over-all quality , set , cast , organization , or grammar of the whole of a culture or language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . The total patterns of separate cultures sometimes are perceptibly similar , even though differing considerably in their content ; and they can become similar of themselves even though starting out independently and different . Or , conversely , they can begin by being alike and then diverge increasingly . Their value is thus low for tracing historical connections or proving relationships . Their significance lies in expressing the distinctive individuality and quality pervading a whole culture or language . 135 . PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS It will be seen that the examples just cited of whole-culture patterns tend somewhat toward the psychological ; they have psychological implications . This is inherent in physiognomic characterizations , whether these be of particular men , of racial types , of historical periods , or of cultures . A face may express sternness or majesty or raptness or serenity or benevolence or craftiness or intellectuality or sensuousness , or combinations of such qualities . In much the same way , in referring to a civilization or period or tribal culture or phase , we often use terms of psychological appraisal , such as fatigue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originality . Yet it is true that other characterizing concepts , such as family names , ancestor worship , bureaucracy , encyclopaedias , manual arts , obviously refer to specific institutions or concrete cultural phenomena . It would seem accordingly that formulations of the total pattern of cultures contain both strictly cultural and psychological characterizations . A formulation begins with the former , with institutions or folkways ; and as these more and more weave themselves into a larger coherence , it gradually also becomes evident in what directions the culture is faced , what ends it looks toward , which qualities it is occupied with and prizes most . In short , its characteristic values and its characteristic attitudes or orientations become comprehensible . An attitude , or for that matter an orientation , necessarily implies psychology . Attitudes might be said to refer to the ways an organism sets or arranges or orients itself , adjusts inwardly and outwardly to its environment ; anything in its merely internal physiological operations would hardly come under attitude and orientation . Where the boundary lies here between straight anthropology and straight  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are still within the jurisdiction or claims of anthropology if the environment ? toward which human organisms react by an attitude or an orientation ? is a cultural one , if it includes folkways or mores with societal pressure , or , in wholly untechnical language , institutions . If however the environment is unmitigatedly physical , like warm sunshine after exposure to cold , or the proximity of an angry bear when one is in the woods unarmed , the reaction toward the environment is primarily psychosomatic and outside the domain of anthropology . In recent years attempts have been made to characterize cultures definitely in psychological terms . This does not mean that their cultural features were disregarded . On the contrary , their cultural traits were carefully studied for a selection and an enumeration of all those customs and institutions which would fit into a coherent pattern or plan expressible in psychological terms . In short , the procedure was to try to convert cultural phenomena into psychological formulations through the medium of total-pattern recognitions . This is of course the same procedure as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorer , and Fortune have described cultures more or less along these lines , but the most comprehensive procedure has been that of Benedict . She began by contrasting two American Indian cultures , those of the Plains bison-hunters and those of the southwestern Zuni and other Pueblo farmers , as being respectively Dionysiac and Apollinian . The Dionysiac temperament ? named after the god of wine ? is outgoing , addicted to rushes of strong feeling and their expression in activity ; the self is asserted . The Apollinian type of personality is calm , restrained , " classic " ; it dislikes surges of emotion , vehement action , and insistence on the ego ; this last should be muted in favor of group tranquillity . For example , among the Dakota each man was free to seek his own " vision " or inspiration from supernaturals , who instructed him in his personal ritual and made him a shaman . Among the Zuni , such personal experiences would be frowned upon , and personal rituals were socially taboo . Ritual was in the hands of priests holding established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching younger priests to follow in their footsteps . The psychological formulation of Zuni culture as Apollinian is based on a large mass of cultural traits , such as these customs differentiating shamans from priests . Later , Benedict went farther and passed verdicts on cultures outside her personal experiences : the Melanesians of Dobu Island , described by Fortune , and the Kwakiutl Indians of Vancouver Island , on whom elaborate reports by Boas were available . The Dobuan culture she found to be paranoid in its inclinations ; the Kwakiutl , megalomanic . Individual temperaments tend to conform to the cultural set ; they are molded by it . A Dobuan who may be suspicious and plotting by nature fits in with the trends of his society and becomes a successful member of it , a distinguished citizen . But one who has impulses to be confiding and amiable , and can not overcome these impulses , will be taken advantage of by his tribesmen and be a social failure .  | There is no doubt that these four cultures actually differ in the directions described , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , the characterizations tend to be in more or less psychiatric terms , or at least clinical ones , partly because clinical psychology was the first recognized branch of psychology that attempted to deal with whole human beings , as distinct from their intelligence or learning ability or other parts or special aspects of the mind . Furthermore , terms like " paranoid " or " megalomanic " do not imply downright insanity in psychology , as they frequently do in laymen 's speech . A man may have a definite megalomanic streak in him and yet be a " normal " and useful member of society . Most of us in fact can think of an acquaintance or two whom that cap just fits . Also , there are five or ten individuals with clinically recognizable paranoid or schizophrenic or manic-depressive tendencies for every one that actually breaks into such a psychosis . We speak of such persons , quite properly , descriptively and without stigma , as being for instance of manic-depressive temperament . Which is as much as to say that if they were to become insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take such and such a form ; just as one man will show a phthisic constitutional type to a physician , and another an apoplectic one , and yet the betting is that both will ultimately die of some other disease , respectively , than tuberculosis and a stroke . So much then in validation of these translations of total-culture patterns into psychological " diagnoses . " However , there are limitations to this method . So far as it is valid , it ought to be applicable to any and all cultures beyond the four primitive ones cited . Benedict herself seems to think that only some cultures can be described in this way ; the majority are not sufficiently " integrated " around a single psychological trend , not oriented exclusively in one direction . If that is true , then her Zuni , Dobu , Kwakiutl cultures are abnormal cases , and are of significance chiefly as showing to what degree of specialization culture orientations can be pushed . But it seems much more likely that every culture is psychologically characterizable ; and that if only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labels is inadequate , or our interest flags beyond the gaudy ones . Psychologists do not deny a personality to individuals who are complex , balanced , and well rounded , or allow it only to those who have warped themselves around a single impulse or idea . The same must hold for the personalities of cultures . Some will be more decisively one-sided than others . But all must have a psychological physiognomy of some kind corresponding to their cultural physiognomy . ' This is because culture is itself the product of psychosomatic activity ; because in turn it conditions and molds psychology , as we have seen ( ? 123 ) ; and because its operation is necessarily accompanied by psychological functioning . 2 Subsequent well-rounded characterizations of East Asiatic cultures made by Benedict during World War II ( see C 245 for a Siamese example ) avoid the single-label designation .  | As a matter of fact all kinds of psychological emphases can be recognized in cultures , even though it is but a rare culture all of whose manifestations can be constellated around a single motif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yoruba and the Dahomey in West Africa , that are marked by a passion for method and relational organization ; others , such as the Nupe , also in West Africa , view the world matter-of-factly as consisting of an agglomeration of so and so many discrete events which they feel no impulse to order ( ? 251 ) . Acquisitiveness and retentiveness are certainly personality traits . Dobu culture is acquisitive and retentive as well as sensitive and paranoid ; Ifugao , in the Philippines , is acquisitive but normally healthy in its outlook ; Yurok , in native California , is highly retentive of property but neurotically timorous ; the Polynesian and Australian cultures generally are not acquisitive , still less retentive , but geared to constant consumption . There is bound to be one pervasive psychology in a culture that puts a social premium on co-operativeness , but a quite different set of mental reactions when a culture really prizes and rewards ruggedly individual competitiveness . Still other colorings are reviewed in Chapter Fifteen , where this whole set of problems is examined more systematically . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be graded , if not as yet by any system of measurements , at least by general consent . The recognition of some such psychic qualities flows almost inevitably out of recognition of total-culture patterns . Sound formulations are likely to involve various sets of concepts . Thus it might be maintained that there was a culture at one and the same time acquisitive , wasteful , competitive , intuitive , sanguine , and uninterested in relations and abstractions . Which one ? Contemporary American civilization can be so appraised , perhaps without too much unfairness . At any rate it would be generally accepted that there are at least half a dozen distinct psychological strands involved in our national make-up . Such multiple-term characterizations as this , though less incisive , will in the long run be applicable to far more cultures , and are likely to be fuller and truer descriptions than the occasional instances in which a culture is so specialized that nearly everything in it can be disposed along one conceptual axis expressible in a single word . There is a large field here waiting to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterizations , or more psychologists learn to deal with culture . In both sciences , the tools of method have been sharpened , for about the last two lifetimes , by pursuit of critical analysis . Apart from psychiatry as a branch of medicine , clinical or whole-personality psychology of more than mere introspective or guesswork caliber scarcely existed consciously , even in germ , before about 1920 , and is still in its infancy ; and the same is true of whole-culture or pattern anthropology . When both have grown farther , and interpenetrated each other more , the results are likely to be immensely interesting .  | From what has been said about the conditioning or molding of men by their cultures , it is evident that to every total pattern or orientation of culture there must correspond a type of personality . In fact , strictly , all psychic action takes place not in the culture but in the people who participate in it , carry it , and are shaped by it . The culture , which from one angle is a sort of set of rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its existence inevitably induces certain habits in the members of its society ; and these habits aggregate , in any individual , into a particular kind of personality . This personality will tend to be more or less alike in all members of a society , though varied by their purely individual conditionings as well as by their individual heredities , which are never wholly the same . The average or type or mode of these personalities produced in a society by its culture is , strictly , what the cultural psychologist tries to recognize or describe ; the culture that produces the personality type is , strictly , the anthropologist 's first concern . A potlatch and a thousand-guest wedding are cultural facts ; but if a culture favors and rewards them , certain psychological attitudes , such as those toward lavishness and personal ostentation , tend to be set up in most people living in that society under that culture . This idea , of a type of personality always having to correspond to a type of culture , at least on the average , is after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unassailable . It is the basis of the relation of anthropology and psychology , and the reason why examination of whole-culture patterns or physiognomies inevitably suggests psychological implications . This rather simple relation has sometimes been obscured by premature attempts to explain the full causality of cultures or persons ? which no one is yet in position to do ? and sometimes by technical jargon , such as " basic personality structure . " This phrase seems to mean nothing more than the personality type corresponding to a particular culture ? the kind of person normal or average to the culture , one might say . " Basic " is unfortunate , because to biologists " basic " means what is hereditary and congenital , whereas this kind of personality is induced by the culture , not primary . If " basic " refers merely to being typical or average , it would better be called that . " Structure " appears to be just a yielding to a word that has a perfectly good meaning but suddenly becomes fashionably attractive for a decade or so ? like " streamlining " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the pleasurable connotations of its sound . Of course a typical personality can be viewed as having a structure . But so can a physiology , any organism , all societies and all cultures , crystals , machines ? in fact everything that is not wholly amorphous has a structure . So what " structure " adds to the meaning of our phrase seems to be nothing , except to provoke a degree of pleasant puzzlement . Moreover , an impressive phrase like this one tends to provoke an illusion that somehow knowledge of life histories of typical personalities in a society will explain why the culture is as it is ; whereas in the main it is the culture that has made these personalities what  | they are ( ? 123 ) . However , apart from such putting of the cart before the horse , and from the matter of technical verbiage , the idea of some certain kind of a person or type of mentality corresponding to each particular culture is both simple and important . It will be developed farther in Chapter Fifteen . 136 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow , by reviewing the course of those civilizations we know best through their history or archaeology , we are soon struck by a familiar phenomenon . Successful growth , which in retrospect is judged to have been productive , tends to come intermittently , in pulses or irregular rhythms . The word " cycles " is sometimes used , but it denotes a repetitive return , and return is more than is really characteristic of the phenomena now in question , or at least more than is sure about them . The manifestations are more like unpredictable swells or waves than like any wheel-of-fortune action in which an idea of retribution is implicit , or of a fate that eventually levels all things out . The " rise and fall of nations " is the familiar phrase that refers to the phenomenon ; but there is actually a good deal involved beyond the success or failure of national fortunes . There is included , it is true , politico-military achievement : that is , success of the society in outright competition with other societies . But , more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; an increase in wealth ; technological advances ; and bursts of productivity in the aesthetic and intellectual fields , all the way from sculpture to literature , from philosophy to science . The peaks in these several activities may come simultaneously , or overlapping , or in close succession . Sometimes the total rise is gradual , as was that of ancient Rome ; sometimes it comes suddenly , or seems abrupt , perhaps because the initial stages have not got into the preserved record of history . An almost supertypical example is provided by the ancient Greeks : Military success : 500-250 B.C. Politics : progressively democratic constitution building , 600-400 Population : increasing to probably 300 , decrease by 200 Philosophy : 585-200 ; peak : Plato , Aristotle , 400-320 Science : 585-150 ; peak : Euclid , Archimedes , 320-220 Medicine : 5o0-loo ; peak : Hippocrates , 420 History : 500-200 ; peak : Thucydides , 420 Tragedy : 500-400 ; peak : Sophocles , 450 Comedy : 48o-28o ; peak : Aristophanes , 420 Poetry : 650-200 ; peak : Pindar , 450 Oratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 550-100 ; peak : Phidias , 450 Painting : 500-100 ; peak : Apelles , 330 Architecture : 600-loo ; peak : Parthenon , 450  | It is evident that for a few centuries Greek cultural activities were much heightened in the quality of their values achieved : the near-concurrence of dates is striking . The five centuries involved include everything the Greeks produced which the world since their time has thought important , with the following few exceptions : Around 850-800 B.C. , well before the main growth , there were the Homeric epics . Under the Roman Empire , two or more centuries after the great growth , there occurred an aftermath of science , largely in the nature of codifications ( Ptolemaic astronomy , Galenic medicine , A.D. 100-150 ) ; a philosophic revival ( Neo-Platonism , A.D. 250 ) ; and a " silver-age " prose literature ( Plutarch , A.D. 150 ) . All the rest of the Greek contribution falls in the period 650-too B.C. ; much the most of it , in fact , is comprised in the three centuries 500-200 , with practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this happened in a quite small area , as well as in the quite brief time . To put it a little differently , there was an enormous concentration of culture energy and innovation , of production of high cultural values , and of flourishing of men of the first rank of genius , in a very limited space and period , in contrast with much less of the same that the Greeks did before or after or elsewhere . Quite so intense a condensation was perhaps never again accomplished in history . But the number of less extreme examples is indefinitely large . In Rome , the " Augustan " age around the time of the birth of Christ corresponded to the Greek " Periclean " age . All the most notable Roman achievements cluster around this Augustan climax , within a century or two before and after it : Cicero , Caesar , Lucretius , Virgil , Horace , Ovid , Tacitus ; the world 's first truly realistic portrait sculpture fifty to a hundred years after Augustus ; Trajan , the emperor who brought the Empire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , road-building , engineering , and probably population and wealth , in the first two Christian centuries . Sometimes such bursts come repetitively within one area and population , as in China of the Chou , Han , and T'ang dynasties ; or in Egypt of the Pyramid Age , the Middle Kingdom , and the New Empire , with an aftermath renascence . ' Sometimes successful activities string along spottily and successively , or somehow fail to appear altogether . Thus England was musically productive until 1700 , musically imitative or second-rate thereafter ; but began painting successfully only after 1750 ; and never had a first-rank sculptor . Holland 's great men all came in the 1600 's : Spinoza in philosophy , Rembrandt in painting , Huygens in physics , Vondel in literature . This was also the century of successful Dutch aggression against Spaniards and Portuguese , of the founding of their colonial empire , and of an unusual accumulation of wealth . In a small country it seems to he easier for everything to pile up simultaneously . The much more numerous a Most productive about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' At peak around 2600 , 1900 , 1400 , 600 B.c. , respectively .  | adjacent Germans toward 1800 had in Kant , Goethe , Beethoven , the greatest contemporary European philosopher , poet , and musician , respectively ; but politically they were mediaeval and disunited , and militarily Napoleon buffeted them around . Their famous science was only just beginning to function successfully at the time . During the nineteenth century this science flourished , Germany became politically organized and strong in war , population and wealth increased faster than in most of Europe ? but German philosophy , literature , and music were progressively on the downgrade . Nevertheless , on the larger view the significant thing is the close time association of these somewhat separate German culminations . Some merely happen to reach their peak a little before the others ? some during 1750-1825 and some during 1825-1900 . It will be seen that there are two related aspects to the type of phenomena we are considering . One is the fact of the production of great men and great cultural achievements ; the other is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It used to be customary to " explain " such happenings as these , especially literary ones , by referring them to the stimulating effect of great victories , or other national events . It was said , for instance , that Shakespeare was somehow helped to write great plays by the defeat of the Spanish Armada ; Phidias , Sophocles , and the other Athenians similarly were pushed forward to higher achievement by Marathon and Salamis ; Augustus at last ended civil war and brought peace . But in many cases closer examination of the facts shows that the literary or other burst had already begun before the political event . And even if the burst is wholly subsequent , it is hard to see why and how better painting , or a discovery like Harvey 's of the circulation of the blood , should be " produced " by a victorious war . The present-day view is that this kind of working from specific cause to specific effect will mostly not hold water in these complex matters of civilization . Modern opinion sees correlations or functional interrelations between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A " produces " B. The Armada , Shakespeare , the playwriters who preceded both , the poet Spenser , Harvey with his circulation of the blood , Napier and his invention of logarithms , the composers of madrigals , the freebooter Drake , Raleigh and his colonial expansion , are all interconnected in making the Britain of 1575-1615 . Each of them represents or expresses part of a successful pattern ; and the group of patterns together constitutes the national culture-whole pattern of England in its temporary " Elizabethan " phase . These national spurts of success and concentrations of cultural productivity may accordingly be regarded as constituting a phenomenon that recurs through history ? and presumably through prehistory ? even though separate occurrences never manifest wholly identical forms . The bursts have considerable significance in illuminating the dynamics of style patterns , the nature of genius , and die causes of invention . Their bearing on these three matters will now he considered in turn .  | 137 . STYLE PATTERNS The basic reason for the concentrations of productivity seems to be that for things to be done well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be achieved only through some specific method , technique , manner , or plan of operations . Such a particular method or manner is called a style in all the arts , as we have seen . And " style " is perhaps the best available word that will cover also the corresponding methods or plans in other activities . We can speak of styles of governing , of waging war , of prosecuting industry or commerce , of promoting science , even of speculative reasoning . For instance , all modern Occidental business is carried on in a style that includes banking and credit . But ancient and Byzantine and Islamic businessmen necessarily followed a quite different style or pattern because they did not seriously employ credit , and actual money had usually to be collected or moved for any and all transactions . A style , then , may be said to be a way of achieving definiteness and effectiveness in human relations by choosing or evolving one line of procedure out of several possibles ones , and sticking to it . That means , psychologically , that habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this skill can then be extended to larger situations or to somewhat altered ones . This process may mount for a while , the original skill itself being developed farther or giving rise to subsidiary ones . Or it may mount through enlargement of the field to which it is being applied , and therewith the product achieved perhaps increases in quantity as well as improving in quality . But the process can not go on mounting indefinitely , because it began with a limitation of choice , a selection among possibilities . Therefore every style is necessarily prelimited : it is an essential commitment to one manner , to the exclusion of others . Accordingly it can not encompass everything . The range of its channeled skills will extend so far ; beyond , they fail . Then we say that the style has exhausted itself , its characteristic pattern has broken down . Or the style may be able to maintain itself for a while , but without any longer increasing the range of its control or improving its achievements . When this termination has been reached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The style either loses its skill of touch and its products deteriorate ; or it becomes frankly repetitive , which is usually equivalent to a slowed-up deterioration , interest and feeling having been lost when further change is eliminated . A pickup in quality will normally be possible only with a new start toward a new style . And the evolution of a new style is likely to be easier to outsiders or novices than to the group which has been reared in an old style . That is why nations replace one another in their achievements ; or if one does repeat , it is usually after a considerable interval . This course of development will be familiar to anyone who has ever followed through the history of any art style , whether in literature , sculpture , paintThis is the last of the four kinds of patterns listed in the introduction to this chapter .  | ing , architecture , or music . It is a commonplace that all aesthetic styles rise and fall and perish . All art has constantly to get itself reborn with a new set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why that is so is what has just been set forth . But , as has also been just said , the arts are by no means something wholly set apart from the rest of civilization . The same principles of style or method , and therefore of pulsation , tend to hold for most or all cultural activities except the basic day-by-day and year-by-year repetitive ones like plowing and reaping , making a living , cooking and eating , marrying and dying . And even in these day-by-day activities , style patterns do intrude : we certainly have changing styles of cookery ? usually dignified as cuisines ; of marrying ? early or late , for love or convenience , and so on ; of funerals and corpse disposals . However , let us consider a cultural activity that is obviously neither of the repetitive kind nor aesthetic , one that passes as cumulatively progressive : science . We have seen that Greek science and mathematics came in a four-century spurt and then stood still . The Greeks never did achieve much in simple arithmetic , probably partly because their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific numbers instead of by position numerals ? made ordinary computations of any size difficult . Even less was accomplished by them in algebra , of which the imperfect rudiments began ? or first appear to our view ? some four hundred years after Greek general mathematical progress had stopped . The branch of mathematics the Greeks did wholly originate and develop was geometry ? plane , solid , and spherical . Here they substantially " exhausted the pattern , " fulfilled its possibilities , and left nothing for others to discover . Now geometry is a special way of doing mathematics ? with a compass and rule and nothing more , the Greeks insisted . It visualizes properties and relations ; it can be pictured , as algebra and arithmetic can not be . Although already truly abstract , geometry easily retains the most concrete aspect of all branches of mathematics . This geometric approach was the Greek " style " in mathematics . One part of the style was the Greek emphasis on proportion , which can also be diagramed ; and the Greek avoidance , where possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like visible and tangible blocks ; and the avoidance also of negative quantities and irrational fractions , which can not be handled in this way . On the positive side again , the Greeks pushed on from their geometry into conic sections ? dealing with plane cuts across cones , resulting in curves such as ellipses , parabolas , hyperbolas . This is a branch of mathematics which we still call by the original name of " conic sections , " although we mostly express its concepts algebraically now . The further limitations of the mathematical style of the Greeks are shown by their failure to develop anything at all in the field of logarithms , analytical geometry , calculus , or the concept of function . What they could do with their geometrical and whole-number manner or style , they achieved . Other mathematical possibilities , like these mentioned , were simply left to be realized by other peoples and times ? chiefly by western Europeans in the last three or four centuries .  | A style of mathematics quite different from both the ancient Greek and the modern Occidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped , then taken up in Japan around 1600 , and carried farther there during the following two centuries . This was an algebraic approach , though quite different in detail from Western algebra and very likely unconnected with it . This method was used ingeniously enough ; but as neither China nor Japan had ever discovered or learned geometry , their method or style of mathematics was subject to limitations as great as was the Greek method , though the limitations were in many ways almost opposite . For instance , the native Chinese-Japanese algebra handled negative quantities as freely as it handled positive ones , but it concerned itself very little with the properties of shapes , such as triangles , cylinders , or tetrahedrons . In much the same way , the style of ancient Greek science as a whole and the style of European science are distinguishable . The Greeks observed , but without instruments and without standard measures ; and they did not experiment . These aids to the prosecution of science were developed only after A.D. 1500 , as part of the western-European method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning towar of Pisa were made about 1590 . The telescope , invented in Holland in 1608 ( ? 140 , 152 ) , was used for astronomical discovery by Galileo within two or three years . The microscope was almost simultaneous . Since understanding of the subtler forms of energy and of the qualitative properties of matter seems to depend on systematic experimentation , the basic discoveries in electromagnetism and chemistry were made still later , about 1750 to 1800 , after the modern European pattern or style of science was becoming mature . We can assume , then , that the higher values of human civilization tend to be produced in bursts or spurts of growth . This is because their achievement is dependent on the development of specific methods or styles somewhat similar in kind to styles in art ; and , like art styles , it is limited or exhaustible . Further progress , beyond the potentialities of a given style and pattern , normally requires a pause , followed by a fresh start with a new style or pattern ? a new approach to the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost equally to aesthetic activities , to intellectual ones , to politico-military or national fortunes , and even to major economic achievements . At any rate , such related items as machine versus manual manufacture , mass production , and credit suggest that industrial progress can also be due to the fact that a " style pattern " has been devised . 138 . BASIC PATTERN AND STYLE VARIABILITY Dress obviously is heavily involved in the matters under discussion . The first association of many women to " pattern " is likely to be the paper model from which dresses arc cut and shaped . Vulgarly , the word " style " refers to dress  | first of all ; and it is certainly plain that dress in general is heavily conditioned by style . But beyond all this , dress excellently exemplifies even basic pattern and its influence . For instance , Occidental civilization , Ancient Mediterranean , and East Asiatic are each characterized by a distinctive , long-term basic pattern of clothing . In comparison with our fitted clothing , Greek and Roman clothing was draped on the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true comparatively . Sleeves were little developed , trousers lacking , the waist of clothing was not fitted in to follow the body , the general effect accentuated the fall of drapery and the flowing line . The Roman toga was a wrap-around blanket . One did not slip into it like a coat , one adjusted it to hang in proper folds . After prevailing for many centuries , this basic pattern of dress began to crumble and become transformed toward the end of the Roman Empire , when the old Hellenic-Latin religion had yielded to Christianity and the total Mediterranean civilization was disintegrating and at the point of gradually being replaced by the beginnings of our Occidental one . Trousers , in spite of protests and counterlegislation , were adopted from the barbarians . Sleeves came into general use . During the Dark Ages , the transition was gradually accomplished . The fitted clothes might be pretty well concealed under a long coat or cloak , as in the sixth-century mosaics of the Eastern Emperor Justinian and the Empress Theodora ; but they were there . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pattern is still the fundamental pattern of our own clothing . The characteristic of this , in contrast with ancient clothing , is that it is cut and tailored , fitted to the figure . Our word " tailored " is from French tailleur , one who cuts , carves , or trims ; and taille still denotes both the figure as a whole and the waist . The plan of Western clothing for men is that its parts follow the limbs as well as the figure . For women , on the contrary , the legs are withdrawn from sight in a skirt that during most centuries has been ample . From the hips up , however , the pattern of Western women 's wear makes up for the loose skirt and has a bodice or an equivalent that follows waist , bosom , shoulders , and arms fairly closely . How thoroughly this is our basic type of dress even today , underneath all local or national variations and fluctuations of period and fashion , is evident when we compare Western dress as a whole for the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chinese and Japanese dress is also cut and tailored , but it is not fitted . It is cut loose , with ample sleeves , or kimono style , to suggest a broad figure . Trousers are ample , so as to have almost a skirt effect . The use of clothing to model or suggest women 's bust , waist , and hip contour is wholly outside the Far Eastern pattern . Witness the Japanese obi sash and bow intended to conceal these features , while European women for four centuries or more have worn corsets and girdles to accentuate them . Of course dress is notoriously subject to fashion change . But it is remarkable how virtually all changes of fashion , alike in Classical , Western , and East  | Asiatic costume , have consistently operated each within the basic dress pattern of its own civilization . Fashion creates a thousand bizarre forms and extravagances ; but it never has produced , among Occidentals , a man 's type of dress based on toga instead of trousers , nor a woman 's with a Japanese silhouette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of restless and anonymous innovation or invention , is discussed elsewhere ( ? 164 ) , with emphasis on a concealed rhythm or regularity much greater than the participants in a fashion are ordinarily aware of . But there is another aspect of fashion change ? what may be called the intensity of its alteration , its momentary degree of variability ? that both defines the basic pattern and helps to explain variation from it . Variability is high when the fashion of one year differs considerably from that of the year before ; it is still more so when a series of particular dresses , all of the same year , differ considerably from one another . Low variability of course is marked by small differences of this sort . Such variabilities are easily expressed statistically . " The underlying fashion swings or trends change what might be called the total silhouette of dress rather than its details . These minor features may come and go quite rapidly , and are what give the impression nearly everyone has that dress fashions are highly unstable . On the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward one extreme of proportion , such as a narrow skirt for women , and then for about fifty years toward the opposite , giving a wavelength of close to a century for the periodicity , which seems to be adhered to with fair consistency in case after case . It might be thought that the basic pattern ( for Occidental women 's dress during the last hundred and fifty years ) would lie somewhere between these proportion extremes . Occasionally it does . But mostly the basic pattern proves to coincide with one of the extremes . The other extreme then represents a sort of opposition or aberration from the pattern . One might describe these aberrant extremes as the proportions still just inside the pattern but as far away as possible from its center of gravity . Or one might say the aberrant extreme is antithetical ? almost perversely antithetical ? to the ideal or saturation point of the pattern , though still barely remaining within its range . Thus , as the permanent Western pattern aims at amplitude from the hips down but slenderness above , the silhouette-extremes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt , long or low skirt , narrow waist , and therefore waistline just at the waist proper . The antithetical extremes would be : narrow skirt , short skirt , wide or full waist , and waistline moved from the anatomically narrowest part up toward the broader breast or down toward the broader hips . In this last proportion ? position of the waistline ? pattern saturation evidently falls at the midpoint between extremes . In the three other proportions , pattern saturation coincides with one of the extremes . " By the standard deviation or sigma , converted into a percentage of the mean as the rucflicient of variability .  | A glance at the silhouettes in the upper row of Figure 19 , showing characteristic dress at twenty-year intervals during the latter and larger part of the nineteenth century , reveals what characterizes the pattern ? its consant stable features underneath temporary fluctuations . The lower row gives two silhouettes from the period of the French Revolution and Napoleon , and two from the period of the World Wars ? two eras of sociopolitical restlessness enclosing the relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are narrow or high or both , and waists that are thick or ultrahigh or ultralowthe aberrant extremes . VARIABILITY IN EUROPEAN WOMEN 'S DRESS SILHOUETTE DURING FOUR YEARS OF PATTERN CONFORMITY AND STABILITY COMPARED WITH FOUR YEARS OF PATTERN STRAIN AND INSTABILITY Stable Pattern Years . Low Variability * Mean of 1839 1859 1879 1899 4 years // // // // Unstable Pattern Years : High Variability * Mean of 1789 1813 1916 1935 4 years // // // // * Figures express 100 ( V for year ) / ( mean V for 150 years ) . ? V = 100r/M When we look at the statistical expression of fashion variability in the same selected eight years as given in corresponding position on the facing page , it is at once clear that the years and decades of pattern saturation or concordance are marked by definitely low variability , indicative of stability ; and the years and eras of pattern antithesis or stretch are marked by a surprisingly great variability , indicative of instability . Stability and instability here refer to the dress style pattern and its behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marked sociopolitical instability and churning , there is presumably a connection . The connection or relation seems functional rather than causal . There is nothing to indicate that the mere presence of wars and revolutions will make designers deliberately plan consecutive dresses as different as is possible within  | the mode , whereas in times of calm they design them as alike as they can make them and still keep them from being identical . What evidently happens is merely that in periods of general stress , when the foundations of society and civilization seem rocked , the pattern of dress is also infected and subject to strain . It expresses this strain by moving from stable saturation to aberration , antithesis , restlessness , and instability . ' This example may make more concrete the role of patterns ? both style patterns and total-culture patterns ? in cultural change and stability . Not that patterns are the beginning and end of everything about civilization . But practically everything in culture occurs as part of one or more patterns . Hence whatever happens in the way of accomplishment , alteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen through the mechanism of patterns . We do not yet know too much about them , because awareness of patterns is relatively recent in anthropology . But it is already clear that understanding of culture as something more than an endless series of haphazard items is going to be achieved largely through recognition of patterns and our ability to analyze them . 139 . THE CLUSTERING AND NATURE OF GENIUS We have seen that the higher values of civilizations , their greater accomplishments , tend to be achieved spasmodically , in intermittent bursts . Also , these bursts can be associated with the growth and fulfillment of style-type patterns . Yet there is something else equally associated with the bursts of cultural productivity . This is frequency of genius , frequency of extraordinarily gifted individuals . Personalities of the very highest ability ? whether in ruling , thinking , imagining , innovating , warring , or religious influencing ? have long been known to occur in concentrations of country and period . The list in ? 136 is not only a tabulation of when drama , sculpture , war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient Greece ; it is equally an enumeration of its great men , its outstanding geniuses . The philosophy , for instance , is exemplified by Plato and Aristotle , by their predecessors like Democritus and Socrates , by their successors like Epicurus and Zeno the Stoic . Or we can equally well say that it is these men who produced the philosophy . These are but two ways of describing the same phenomenon . Obviously , there is not going to be much important philosophy without able philosophers around , nor able philosophers without important philosophy to show for it . 7 Literally , of course , it is the minds of designers of dresses that are affected and show strain in their creations . But since such individuals tend to be affected and to react more or less alike , it is their common behavior , and the common drift of their products , that are historically most significant . This significance in turn justifies the use of short cut metaphors like " patterns being infected , " " straining , " " moving , " " saturating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects , the philosophy and the philosophers , the activity and product or the personalities , there is no doubt which is the easier to grasp : the concrete persons . All sorts of Athenian contemporaries saw , heard , and perhaps touched Socrates , and had quite definite reactions to him and judgments of his merits ? Athenians who nevertheless knew little and understood less of his thoughts . Through the accounts of Plato and Xenophon , Socrates remains today a very living and real personality whom one can never quite forget even if one 's interest in philosophy be zero or negative . Hence ordinarily we tend to think first of Socrates the man and secondarily of what new ideas he produced . To put it on a lower level , a child can not comprehend a philosophy , but it can comprehend events like being married to Xantippe or drinking hemlock in prison . The first recognition of the two-faced type of phenomenon we are dealing with , accordingly , was in terms of great men and their near-simultaneity or clustering . This fact was already recognized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a historian contemporary with Augustus , has quite a little passage on it . No one since appears to have doubted it . However , as long as the matter is viewed simply as one of persons , it remains rather meaningless ? curious but inexplicable . It came to be accepted that there are golden ages thickly studded with great men achieving unforgettable products ; silver ages with somewhat lesser men attaining smaller performance ; and ordinary times when men of ability or talent are still available though the great lights of history just do not put in their appearance . But no reason was manifest , through many unstatistically minded centuries , for such fluctuations , which glaringly violate the principle of random distribution or accidental occurrence , and therefore suggest that there must be specific factors at work to produce the unevennesses . Biologically we know that hereditary races are constant to the degree that if a thousand morons and one man of genius are born per million in this generation , the proportion is unlikely to be seriously different in the next generation or for a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no great men , began to have a few in the sixth century , produced an astonishing number of geniuses of absolutely first rank in the fifth and fourth centuries , tapered off in the third , then became sterile again and has remained so until now , there is no known mechanism of heredity which can explain this fluctuation of incidence of high ability ; nor is it within the reasonable bounds of mere statistical possibility . Galton , who still argued for a change to inherent race superiority in the Athenians ( ? 90 ) , because little was known before his time about the heredity of intelligence and ability , already recognized that the brief upcurve could not be a statistical accident , but that it must indicate some factor at work . Nor is there any serious doubt now what that factor is , among the ancient Athenians and in similar cases . It is , in general , what is variously called the milieu , the social environment , the cultural context , the condition of civilization . More specifically , the involved factor may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the value or style patterns of the Greeks , and among them of the Athenians in particular , around 500 B.C. There was a style of tragedy , for instance , in the making then . Aeschylus developed this tragic style farther in the grand manner , Sophocles freed it from the last traces of archaism , Euripides introduced the final psychological finesses and tendernesses ? and in this style of tragedy there was nothing essential or important left to be done . If there had been an unfinished remnant to be achieved , it is expectable that this remnant would have been contributed . With the exhaustion of the Greek tragic pattern , no very great Greek tragic poets could arise , it may fairly be argued . There was nothing left for them to do in the Athenian pattern . Nor could they , as children of their time and place , conceivably invent Elizabethan or Japanese tragedy , not even in Attic Greek language dress . Now this explanation does not mean that the state of the dramatic pattern in Athens around 400 B.C. prevented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expressing themselves in tragic poetry . Such a direct reaction of a momentary condition of culture on organic heredity would be an even more unreasonable belief than Galton 's belief that the heredity turned itself on and off again within a dozen generations like a playful faucet . What the situation does warrant us in inferring is that when general cultural conditions and specific dramatic pattern conditions were at their optimum in Greece , there would be an average of one individual of the poetic potentiality and caliber of Sophocles or Euripides born among so and so many thousand or million Athenians ; and also that these rare individuals would be able to realize or express their gift by writing tragedies . When the general and specific pattern conditions were not at optimum , there would continue to be just as many potential poetic geniuses born among the same number of Athenians , but they would not become tragedians , or if they stubbornly tried to , they would find that their say had already been said , and that instead of fame they were acquiring mainly a repute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a somewhat different vein in them also , they might still become great comic poets , since Athenian comedy ran a somewhat later course than tragedy . Or if their gifts were not too narrowly specialized but were plastically adaptable , these potential geniuses might have become actualized geniuses in oratory or history-writing , or perhaps even in philosophy . Here we are at the border of certainty of opinion , because no one yet knows how far the high capacities that we call genius are congenitally specialized ? say for poetry and not for prose ? or on the contrary how far these capacities are general ? like articulateness of expression , for instance , or originality of ideas ? and it is a matter of conditioning after birth that determines whether the inherent genius is to become a writer of tragedy , comedy , lyrics , or prose . In any event , within a very few hundred years there was no form of literature left active in Athens , and soon after that no form of cultural activity anywhere among Greeks , in which a congenital super-AAA genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was because the possibilities of Greek civilization were so used up , its pattern so exhausted , that no super-AAA achievement was any longer possible in that civilization . The same one-in-fourthousand or two-hundred-in-a-million births of top-flight ability presumably continued to take place in Greek society in subsequent times as before . ' But these individuals simply no longer had any chance to become top-flighters . They very likely became the leaders of their day ; but posterity would rate them only BBB instead of AAA , because what posterity can judge , or does judge , is accomplishment . What posterity can not readily judge , of course , and ordinarily is too busy to try to , is how much of any accomplishment is due to innate or hereditary endowment and how much due to favorable cultural and environmental circumstance . What we have in this whole matter , in summary , is first the fact that great men do constellate , or genius does cluster ; and second , an explanation of that fact in terms of degree of development of patterns of the style type . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection that only a fraction of all the men congenitally equipped for genius ever actualize as such . Only a fraction are ever found out , or allowed the rank , by history . This fraction is the same as the proportion that the number of generations recognized as fruitful and genius-studded , in all lands , bears to the number of barren , geniusless generations . This proportion can hardly be reckoned as greater than one in four , and may be as little as one in ten , if we take into account all the regions and eras of the world in which it is customary not to recognize any geniuses as having occurred . There is a point of impressive significance here . Human biological heredity runs good enough to produce , once in every so many hundred thousand or million births , an individual so highly gifted as to be capable of becoming one of the lights of our species , a benefactor or a creator whose work will live in history ; and yet the nature of our culture manages to neutralize or frustrate from seventy-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to depress them into mere second-rank talents or transient leaders of soonforgotten days . Ideally considered , this is a tremendous waste from the point of view of those concerned with human achievement . It certainly invites the consideration of eugenicists , to whom it offers the pessimistic prospect that even if they should succeed in improving the heredity of our species , three-fourths or more of the gain would be lost again by the shockingly wasteful way in which civilization to date has operated 8 Galton computed 248 in a million , or i in 4032 , as born in Attica 530-430 B.C. 9 This over-all wastage of 75 per cent or more of the finest congenital talents born in the human species may seem to constitute a blasting indictment of human culture . But without culture , the waste would be a complete loo per cent . Culture is admittedly still an imperfect instrument .  | Logically , of course , what we have in this situation about genius is a distinction we have already considered in connection with race ( ? 86 , 90 ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they do not correlate in any outright one-to-one or other simple manner . We assume that achievement presupposes inherent capacity , though even here it is a problem to be investigated how close the correspondence comes to being a loo-percent one . We certainly can not assume that capacity is always actualized in achievement . One difference between the race problem and the genius problem is that differences in ability between races are still somewhat uncertain , and , being differences of averages , are likely to prove small ; whereas individual differences within one race and culture are well substantiated as considerable by psychological and practical tests . Moreover , it is relatively easy to compare individuals of practically identical physique , culture , economic stratum , and social opportunities and yet find marked differences between them ; whereas races are never the same in culture , social environment , and opportunities . Recognition of the fact that potential capacity may not be inferred in regard to race outright from accepted achievement , especially not negatively , began to be well and widely established by 1900 . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come until well along in the twentieth century . And the significance of the clustering of both genius and cultural florescence has at times even yet failed to penetrate where an unhistorical attitude of mind prevails . One possible misconception will be guarded against by its mention . The naive view of course is that great men do great things . The greater achievements of civilization are therefore " explained " by the great men 's happening to come along . Why they come along when and where they do hardly seems to call for further explanation in a pre-culture-conscious period . But once we are aware of culture and begin to take note of its workings , the simultaneous clustering of genius and of style-pattern fulfillments is one of the outstanding manifestations of history , and seems to lead inevitably to the conclusion of the interrelation of genius and pattern . The admission of this interdependence may put some curb on our notion of genius . We can certainly no longer look upon genius as something wholly unaccountable , heaven-sent , exempt from the laws of nature , operative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced to a phenomenon , and therewith relatable to other phenomena . But genius is thereby not abrogated or denied . The genius remains the superior man , even the supremely able one . But he is such at birth by the bounty of the variability of organic heredity ; and he is such at death by the grace of the condition of his culture , which has allowed and helped him to realize his congenital potentialities . In short , understanding of how culture operates does not in the least " abolish " individual superiority . It merely helps to explain greatness while using it also to explain better the patterns of culture .  | 140 . THE MEANING OF SIMULTANEOUS INVENTIONS Allied both to pattern florescences and to genius clustering is the fact that many inventions have been made independently by two or more men , and often even simultaneously . If this happened just now and then , and were true of only a small minority of all inventions , it could be called coincidence and attributed to accident . But as soon as simultaneity and independence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is evident on the basis of the law of averages that some specific factor must be operating in that direction . Now the number of cases is not small : Ogburn and Thomas as long ago as 1922 had listed 148 instances . It is therefore of interest to understand what is at the bottom of the phenomenon , and why it went unrecognized so long ? until about the time of World War I. The reason for the nonrecognition seems to have been the reluctance of our minds to see anything superpersonal in matters that involve persons . Acceptance of impersonal forces lying outside the individual , but driving him to this achievement or that failure , appears somehow to infringe on our personalities , to delimit our freedom . Particularly do we tend to resent such invasions when they concern great intellects . After 1700 , everybody who knew anything of the history of science was aware that Newton and Leibnitz had both devised the calculus , and each at first without knowing of the other 's discovery . It was their respective followers and compatriots who fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams and Leverrier separately predicted the discovery of the planet Neptune . Adams 's computation was worked out a little the earlier , but Leverrier 's was published first , and the planet was promptly seen where he had said it ought to be . In 1858 , Darwin and Wallace presented parallel papers at the same meeting of the Royal Society , setting forth the idea of natural selection as a factor accounting for the evolutionary formation and change of species . Darwin had had the germ of the idea twenty years before , but hesitated to commit himself publicly . When the same idea occurred to Wallace , who was exploring in the East Indies , he promptly wrote it out and sent it to London . This both forced Darwin 's hand and strengthened his confidence , with the result of the companion papers as an immediate compromise fair to both men , and the publication of Darwin 's Origin of Species the next year . The year 1900 saw the discovery of the basic laws of heredity ? it was really a rediscovery , but more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biologists : De Vries , Correns , and Tschermak . These four instances , all of them relating to fundamental discoveries in science , will at least suffice to take the phenomenon of simultaneity out of the range of mere coincidence . The list on the next page , which could be increased  | indefinitely , will reinforce the principle . If practically all of the cases cited are from modern Occidental civilization , that is because invention records which are authentic , full , and exactly datable nearly all hail from that civilization . Also it will be seen from the list that technological invention , scientific discovery , and even geographical discovery all behave much alike in this matter of simultaneity ? in line with their shading into one another otherwise , as set forth in ? 145 .

This is a matter which will be taken up again , and more fully , in connection with the nature of invention , in ? 145-155 , especially 152 . Our more immediate concern here is with the clustering of able inventors around an important invention or series of related inventions , like the clustering of able or great men in a particular art or any phase of a nationally delimited culture growth . The two sets of clusterings are strikingly similar ; and it is evident that they are both related to the development of culture patterns . The patterns must have a certain potentiality , and they must have reached a stage of " fruitfulness , " before we can expect great men , great productions , or great inventions . But once geniuses , achievements , or inventions begin to arrive , they may be expected in bursts of concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which operate either toward the stabilization and preservation of cultures and their parts , or toward growth and change . Changes , in turn , may consist either of increments , such as new developments , inventions , and learned traits acquired from outside ; or of losses and displacements . Beyond these , there are minor alterations or fluctuations that are neither particularly additive nor deductive , as when the wheel base of automobiles is shortened , or the floor is lowered , or the engine is placed behind . The main value of these formal distinctions of kinds of process is logical : they help us organize a large mass of facts into some sort of preliminary order . For that reason the topical sequence of consideration : persistence , invention , loss , in this chapter , and change in the next , will be followed here . But as cultures and their parts actually live , thrive , decay , and alter , and as they influence one another , these several processes , which in the abstract seem so neat and distinctive , are found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often at work at once , so that the same phenomenon may be seen as an example of two or three of them . This constant interrelation of processes is characteristic of culture . Their segregation has something artificial about it , and is justified chiefly by convenience . For instance , one might expect innovations to cause displacements : for the steel knife to crowd out the stone knife . But the latter may survive in ritual ; or  | the stone tool may have become associated with certain motor habits that it is awkward or unprofitable to change , as when the Yurok Indians eagerly took over our American knives for most purposes , but during a couple of generations retained their flint ones for dressing and splitting salmon . If there is such a retention alongside the addition , the culture of course now possesses two traits instead of one . Yet we may not assume that this always happens , else cultures would regularly grow additively or cumulatively . They do sometimes : our Western civilization undoubtedly has more content now than it had a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions when losses can and do exceed additions : for instance , in Italy during the first seven or eight centuries of the Christian era . What happens in particular cultures may of course happen to their sum , to human culture in the aggregate . The total quantity of this probably does tend to increase , but certainly at uneven rates in different periods and areas , as already discussed in ? 127 . Variation and fluctuation of culture content are evidently more typical events than its steady increase . If any generic inherent force making for progressive cultural accumulation existed , it would be difficult to explain the fact that there still remain backward and lowly " primitive " cultures of meager content . We may conclude that while innovations sometimes result in displacements , they sometimes do not ; but that losses also can occur without gains . While there is a relation between the two currents , they are separate enough to justify their separate consideration . Even changes and persistences blend into each other . The normal way in which culture continues is for one generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation , the process occurring in time , since societies and cultures are normally attached to an area . But when one culture transmits some of its content to another ? when for instance porcelain or papermaking diffuses from China to Europe , or glass or surveying from Europe to China ? the receiving culture has changed by acquiring something new , though the process of transmission is now through space instead of time . But from the angle of the total culture material in the world , there has been merely a continuance of a trait , accompanied by its geographical spread , conceivably without any change in the trait itself , or only minimal change . Ultimately a diffusing technique or institution or system may even die out or be displaced in its homeland , but survive where it was imported ; as Christianity withered away in Palestine , and Buddhism in India , but they continue to flourish respectively in Europe and China . In Europe , however , Christianity crowded out all other organized religions ; whereas in China , Taoism and Confucianism have maintained themselves alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statement that conceptually distinct processes tend to come intertwined , and to interact , in the aci u ; il operations and history of culture .  | I42 . PERSISTENCE It has been asserted that the first problem of any culture is that of its survival or persistence , much as any society is always confronted by the problem of surviving . This allegation seems truer logically than important factually . If a culture perishes , there is an obvious end to its problems of adaptation and modification . But this does not by any means involve every culture 's constant striving to avert disaster ? least of all an awareness of being perpetually faced by a life-or-death problem . Nor are societies in chronically acute jeopardy . Their case is rather like that of individual organisms . These also have indispensable needs , but mainly they are organized to function as physiological successes , and on the whole they do so . The same with human societies and their cultures : normally they make a go of it , at least for a time . What is more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do not expect that they themselves and their institutions will have crashed to ruin by next year . Such overclouded , anxietyridden states of mind would have something of the abnormal about them . Perhaps the whole notion of their being usual is a reflection in the minds of some anthropologists of the uncertainties , strains , depressions , and threats of the period from World War I to World War II ( cf. ? 122 ) . What is true is that ordinarily societies cling with attachment to their cultures . Genuine revolutionaries are rare , the world over . They characterize particular periods and limited areas . Reformers are more numerous ; but even these generally want particular improvements on top of a basic maintenance of the scheme of things . And a large part of mankind just is fundamentally conservative ? which means that they like their culture and their personal stake in it . This personal stake and its rewards might well be bigger for the average man , and he is likely to be trying to make it a bit bigger ; but mostly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except perhaps at a spot or two . This is not a statement of what should be , but an attempt to summarize the attitude of most people , primitive , barbarous , and highly advanced , throughout history and all over the earth . There are several reasons for this attachment of men to their cultures . One of course is habit adjustment . We have been molded by our culture until we fit it , more or less , have got used to functioning within its framework , and have channeled such functioning into habits . Then there is always education of the young , both spontaneous and deliberate . This inevitably exalts the ideals and values of the instructing generation . In most countries and times , these ideals of the elders are pretty generally accepted , without much criticism or serious revolt . The folkways tend to persist ; the mores are held to firmly , with release of emotion if they are challenged . It must be remembered that the idea and ideal of progress , which we of modern Western civilization rend to accept as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the least axiomatic to mankind at large . To most societies the notion has hardly occurred , at any rate not as a guiding principle . They rather take essential continuance for granted : the golden age is in the past , not ahead . There certainly is reassurance and comfort in the idea of continuance , unless one has been imbued with the contrary attitude that restless improvement is a desirable thing , or a sort of obligation . The famous French sociologist Durkheim went so far as to maintain that what the " most primitive " people ? meaning the Australians ? really worship through their rites , sacrifices , and taboos is the bonds of their society and the institutions of their culture . The totems and the ancestors and their impersonations , the sacred spots and the hallowed paraphernalia of bull-roarers , the carefully screened mysteries ? all these are not randomly worshiped ghosts , animals , rocks , and fetishes , but symbols of the total tribal society of the past , the present , and the future , and its successful adaptation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This interpretation perhaps fits the Australians more tellingly than it would fit most primitives and nonliterates , and is somewhat extreme even as regards them ; but the view undoubtedly expresses considerable truth , and it would be more widely accepted today if Durkheim had not stretched it into a basic philosophy of all culture and society that savored almost as much of mysticism as did the beliefs of the savages . There is no doubt that most religious cults stress strongly the continuity with all the past , an accord or oneness of the individual or his group with the whole world , and the basic changelessness of these relations . It is also necessary to remember how children ? and adults ? enter into assimilation and participation with their society and culture , as already touched on in ? 123 . One of two main mechanisms for this is voluntary adaptation ? imitation , wanting to conform , learning from example . Some of this is conscious , or begins consciously ; more of it is unconscious , or foreconscious . Perhaps it would be fair to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is latently conscious , toward participation , and therefore toward assimilation and learning , but that the actual imitating by the young is mostly done without much specific awareness . The second mechanism making for participation of the young in their culture , and their fitting into society , is education , learning by being taught or trained . This is clearly in the main a conscious process , even though its implications may often be overlooked . In general , what elders teach the young is ways of becoming what they themselves are and have attained ; or what they might have become and attained under the same cultural rules if their luck or their ability had been better . It is evident that both mechanisms are calculated to work toward perpetuation and persistence .  | 143 . MOTOR HABITS Among the factors that make for persistence of culture , in whatever form it happens to have anywhere , are motor habits . Such habits become established in all higher animals . Resting on congenital anatomical structure , they may be modified , and are channeled , in accord with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , motor habits become particularly conspicuous in the technologies and the arts . As long as these arts are studied chiefly through their products , such as museum specimens , the motor habits that went into the making of the objects do not obtrude . But if it is possible to give attention to production as well as to product , motor habits are quickly seen to be a definite factor . For instance , whittling , sawing , planing , and many other tool operations can be done either by pushing or by pulling . The Japanese carpenter pulls the plane toward himself , centripetally . The Western workman pushes it away from his body , centrifugally . Probably one method is as good as the other in most cases . But once a certain skill has become established in connection with pushing , it is impossible for a given individual to be equally skillful when he substitutes the pulling motion . He may attain such skill by deliberately trying to learn a new habit , but meanwhile his work is that of a novice . As there is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obvious penalty , because of temporarily decreased quality of performance , the change is not made , and the individual remains a lifelong addict to the particular set of habits that first became established in him . Just as he acquired these habits from older workmen , he is likely to transmit them to his apprentices or pupils . Thus not only does one habit prevail among a certain population , and the contrary or a different one among another population , but such habits may persist for hundreds or thousands of years . These habits are definite parts of cultures . The difference between pushing and pulling a plane is as much a culture phenomenon as the difference between smoothing with a piece of sandstone and with a carpenter 's plane . There are a great many situations in which one way of performing an operation is about as good intrinsically as the other ; but it is frequently more efficient , or at least timesaving and effort-saving , to decide on one method and stick to it . Driving on the right or the left side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negligible or slow , it is quite possible to get on without any motor habit or rule . In proportion as traffic is heavy and swift , it becomes indispensable to make a decision once for all and then to establish the chosen habit as an individual automatic reaction , as well as a law of the society . It is notorious that since the nations of the world have felt it necessary each to enforce a choice in the matter , they have divided , some in favor of right-hand and some of left-hand driving . Any reasons for one being intrinsically preferable to the other are mainly rationalizations . What actually seems to have happened is that loose tendencies toward passing oncoming vehicles on one side or the other became  | crystallized as wagon traffic became heavier with the growth of population and the improvement of roads , and were then transferred to the automobile when the matter of uniformity of reaction had become imperative . It is interesting that once such a rule becomes set among a population it may be easier to alter manufactured objects than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on the right side of the seat and turning to the left on meeting another vehicle . He could thus see whether the wheels of the two vehicles were clear . When horses and wagons and roads were introduced in British Colonial America , the driver presumably continued to sit on the right of the seat : he had an established motor habit on this point . Traffic , however , was at first so sparse that apparently any rules of passing fell into disuse ; and when finally , with the increase of horse-drawn vehicles , a rule or custom became desirable , the right-hand pass of oncoming vehicles was somehow chosen . This put the driver away from his clearing wheel ; but apparently this was felt only as a minor objection . Only after the automobile with its much greater speed came on the scene , was there seen to be an element of serious danger . Then the conflict was solved by altering the pattern of car construction so that the driver was now put on the left side of his seat . The rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motor habit is frequently vital , remained unaltered . Even animals get their motor habits conditioned by human culture . In our civilization one mounts to the saddle by the left stirrup . Many horses become disturbed or alarmed by an attempt to mount them from the right . An animal taught to obey the jerk line in multiple-team plowing will not know how to respond to the rein , and vice versa . Differences in motor habits are not necessarily between whole cultures or societies . They may exist between groups within the same society , or between the sexes . Among ourselves a man 's coat or vest buttons from the left over the right . The buttons are on the right edge . The side that carries the buttonholes laps over this from the left . The rule in women 's garments is the opposite . The left side carries the buttons and the right is laid over and outside it . The result is that men execute most of the business of buttoning with their left hand , women with the right . Habits get established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and irritation . In weaving cloth on a vertical loom it is possible to begin inserting the weft either at the top or at the bottom . In a basket the direction of progress of weave can be clockwise or counterclockwise . Here it is possible to sec up explanations to the effect that most people are right-handed , and that it is natural to keep the defter fingers free for the insertion and pulling of the weft while the left hand holds or spreads the warps . A basket can however be woven at the near edge , with the worker facing its outside ; or it can be woven across its hollow , facing the inside , in which case the progress of the same weft between the weaver 's hands would be opposite . Ordinarily perhaps a basket is manufactured  |  resting on what will be its bottom ; but some tribes hang the foundation of the basket up on a cord and work downward toward what will be the rim . In the contrasting cases the same finger manipulations will yield progress in the opposite direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among certain populations . They plainly are cultural differences , although they all preserve the normal supremacy of the right hand . In such instances , factors of organic equipment , such as normal right-handedness , must be recognized if the total situation is to be understood . Yet the direction of progress depends not on this alone , but specifically on how the basket is held . A particular congenital motor habit rarely suffices to explain the whole method of operation : this always remains partly or mostly cultural in origin . Motor habits have the limits of their range set by the human organic equipment , but their specific determination is overwhelmingly by culture . 144 . OTHER HABIT CHANNELINGS There are some persistences in culture that recall habit formations in individuals and into which the factor of habit channeling undoubtedly has entered through the constant overlapping of generations in every society . For instance , in ancient Peru the southern coastal districts early got into the habit of making their pottery vessels with round bottoms , whereas the northern areas favored flat bottoms . This difference was consistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both Peruvian areas , as far back as we have archaeological record of them , developed tubular spouts : single , double , or united like a stirrup-shaped handle . This is a trait which persisted throughout the ceramic history of Peru . On the contrary , in ancient southern Mexico and Central America , habit ran in the direction of providing bowls , pots , and even jars with three legs . This tripod arrangement has certain practical advantages when cooking vessels are to be set over the fire ; but among the Mexicans it became a stylistic manner or trend , because the supports were put on vessels whose shapes or ornamentation shows that they were never set on the fire ; and in some cases the legs have degenerated into functionless lugs or ornamental devices . Moreover , in this same Mexican region the idea of tripod support was extended to objects of totally different uses , such as the metate for grinding corn , and the stool or seat . The tripod habit was already established two thousand or more years ago in the earliest wares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household inventory of Indians and peons . Farther north , in the United States Southwest , whose archaeological history can also be carried back something like two thousand years , both spouts and tripods are characteristically absent . They do occur occasionally , as spouts occur sporadically in Mexico , and tripods in Peru ; and these exceptions arc significant  | because they prove that the ideas of spouts or tripods were not beyond the capacity or range of any of these pottery-making peoples . They were in fact tried , but did not take except each in the area where it became typical . In short , though traits like tripods and spouts are relatively unimportant , they can nevertheless be extremely persistent and characteristic . From the angle of the successful functioning of the native cultures of the three American areas , it was of course immaterial whether they went in for spouts or legs or neither . Yet , having made one stylistic choice or the other , they adhered to it over long periods during which more important features of government , technology , or subsistence were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary habits of a person ? his nonessential mannerisms . An individual early in his life acquires a particular shrug or gesture , a posture or way of seating himself , a manner of articulation , of forming or spacing his letters in handwriting . He goes through periods of good luck and bad luck , his fortunes fall or rise ; but the mannerisms persist . This is not to say that habits in persons and cultures consist entirely of insignificant idiosyncrasies . As a matter of fact , habit formation enters just as much into the bigger and more important features of human life and culture . But in such cases we think of habit as character or attitude system ; and these , being large and complex things , not only are bound to be partially modified with the wear and tear of time , but their persistent core is less easily extricated and defined . The smaller habits , those of the type of mannerisms , are more easily traced just because they are discrete , and because , being of indifferent importance , their very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly long periods . Further examples on the cultural level are teapot-shaped vessels , with a double-curved spout and a handle , which in Japan have an archaeological history stretching back of the introduction of tea into the early Iron Age and even the Stone Age ; and pile houses in the regions around the Alps , as illustrated by the Stone Age lake dwellings of Switzerland , the Bronze Age terramare of Lombardy , and by modern Venice . The North American side of the Atlantic was a clam-eating coast in prehistoric Indian times , as attested by shell mounds , and is so today . By comparison the mussel was neglected as food , and still is , except for a partial change in tastes recently introduced by French and Italian immigrants . On the European side of the same ocean , on the contrary , the clam is little esteemed and the mussel is eagerly eaten ; and this was true in the Stone Age as it is today . This difference may be due in part to the quality of the species available , or to environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on such grounds because the same species of mussel , Mytilus edulis , occurs on both sides of the Atlantic ? in fact has a nearly world-wide distribution . Hence it would seem that the factor of long-term taste habits has contributed to the picture .  | I45 . INVENTION The most incisive form of cultural addition is invention , the finding things out , or , etymologically , " coming into " something new . In studies of culture the word " invention " is used with a somewhat wider meaning than its current popular sense . To the man on the street " invention " denotes a new machine or technological process . In anthropology and culture history it includes this and more . We can for instance speak of institutional inventions , such as the matrilineate , kingship , moiety organization , representative government , or written constitutions . If it seems that this is stretching meanings unduly , because institutions are social growths , usually accepted gradually , so are machines social growths , having antecedents and being accepted gradually , as we shall see . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new philosophical idea . We can just as properly speak of the Copernican invention as the Copernican discovery ; perhaps more properly , because if the theory should ever be found incorrect , it would remain an invention although disproved as a discovery of the truth . From here it is only a step to the discovery of a new planet , and from that to the discovery of the South Pole . The point is not that all these inventions are exactly identical in character , but that they grade into each other . Above all , that they behave much alike , as regards their causes , manner , and effects . It is thus wiser to direct attention to the common features of the behavior of societies when they do something new , rather than to spend much attention on distinctions that are mainly logical . There is one idea it is necessary to be rid of in order to understand the process of invention in general . This is the assumption that our contemporary Western habit of seeking or planning inventions is at all normal . Deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking in most of the history of civilization . It began timidly to come up in Europe around 1300 or 1400 , increased in the 1600 's , but did not become systematic and important until the nineteenth century . It is therefore an exceptional feature of our own civilization . In fact it would have been extremely difficult to plan much invention until both theoretical science and practical technology reached a development , about the seventeenth century , such as had never before been attained . I46 . NECESSITY The old byword of necessity being the mother of invention must be heavily discounted . It is true only in so far as ordinarily there must be a need , or at least a use , for a new thing before it will be devised , and especially before it will be accepted by a society . Necessity may therefore be a spur ; it is never a sufficient cause by itself . Above all , need is a relative and subjective factor . Your need may not be mine . We feel that we need three meals a day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are content . Some obtain food so irregularly that they may not average much more than one meal a day ; when they get enough , it is eaten up . These same people will cheerfully eat three times if they are fed ; but they hardly feel that they must or ought to have meals so often . Their circumstances and habits are different , hence their orientations and expectations also differ from ours . A Negrito wants a little sloping roof over his head ; it does not occur to him that he wants a house with walls . If a river is to be crossed and recrossed , he may build a suspension bridge that shows him possessed of mechanical ingenuity . But a house instead of a leanto windbreak would be extra work and would give him nothing that he really wants . His family is small , his possessions few , and in several days or weeks he expects to move elsewhere because food will be exhausted where he is now . So he does not sense a need that we might regard as imperative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which we are much less intent . They strongly want close and constant association with their kin . The floating laborer of our society who leaves his home folks , drifts about without ever seeing them again or without rearing a family of his own , is as good as unheard-of among them . If a savage leaves his home , it is to settle down and marry among another group . Similarly with religion , which all primitive peoples evidently feel a need of , since they all possess one , and the overwhelming majority of individuals seem genuinely to believe in ? not to mention the much greater number of men in societies that are beyond the primitive . Yet many Russians of today , and a fair number of people among ourselves , get along comfortably without religion . One might contend that the Soviet social program constitutes the prevalent Russian religion . But though a program that leaves no room for God or the soul , which does not recognize anything supernatural , may function emotionally as the equivalent of a religion , though it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it obviously does not quite constitute a religion . In short , necessity is so largely a function of orientation , of goals already established by the extant culture , that it is too variable a factor to be invoked very often to explain invention . It is wants that determine what people do , and wants are states of mind , largely determined in their turn by already existing culture . 147 . ACCIDENT On the other hand , accident is unquestionably one factor in invention and discovery . There are a number of cases in the history of medicine . Sulfanilamid Was first made as far back as 1908 as part of a dye fixative . In 193 , the dye was found to be powerful against streptococcus infections ; research then isolated sulfanilamid as the active agent . Penicillin was " invented " as a result of Fleming 's working with staphylococcus cultures and noting that where these became  | infected with mold the adjacent colonies of bacteria were dissolved away . The shock cure for dementia praecox was discovered through a schizophrenic 's being given , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diabetes that he also had . He almost died , but recovered improved , and the way was pointed . Pasteur was led to the theory and the method of immunization by happening to inject an overlooked and stale bacterial culture of chicken cholera and finding that it failed to kill . It then occurred to him that an attenuated culture might immunize . By contrast , it may be pointed out that for several generations medicine has felt the urgent need for a nonoperative , non-radioactive treatment of cancer , and has brought all the planned resources of several laboratory sciences to bear on the problem , without being able to find a solution . Daguerre solved a crucial problem in the invention of photography through forgetting that he had an open vessel of mercury standing in a cupboard . Into this cupboard , because it was dark , he put away overnight an exposed bromidecoated silver plate . In the morning , the latent image had begun to develop . Daguerre , in a flash , suspected fumes from the mercury , and trial confirmed his suspicion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the essential and hitherto undiscovered factor of " developing " invisible images had been found ( ? 187 ) . Yet to see the situation in its entirety , it must be remembered that Daguerre was a conscious inventor , long seeking a way to a specific goal . That is why he was able to profit at once by his fortunate accident : he was alerted to take advantage of it . Malus 's discovery of the polarization of light came from his happening to be looking at a crystal as he turned it idly in his fingers against a reflection of the rays of the setting sun in facing windows ; he noted that the refraction altered perceptibly with the turning . If he had held the crystal against un ? reflected light ? or even with reflection if the rays had not been coming in nearly horizontally ? there would have been no alteration . Malus had his head full of refraction phenomena at the time , so he promptly verified his chance observation , and determined its meaning by experiments . Another physicist , preoccupied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed it up years later , or forgotten it . The average layman would probably have thought the phenomenon odd and have done nothing about it . It is evident that the degree of experience and the direction of interest of the person to whom the accident happens is at least as important as the accident itself . Thus , one F. P. Smith was testing ship 's screws . An unduly long one hit a snag , broke off , and the boat went faster . This accident might not have been profited by at all except for happening in the course of trials deliberately aimed at invention . Similar was Goodyear 's accidental discovery of hard or vulcanized rubber by heating with sulphur , a process he invented in 1839 and patented in 1844 . Yet the " accident " only happened after Goodyear had been in the rubber-goods  | business and had failed because of the deterioration which articles of rubber underwent . He had in fact previously experimented to prevent this deterioration . Farther back in the history of culture there are a number of instances on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of invention by accident , or as a by-product of some other effort . Rye , for instance , is believed first to have been a weed in wheat or barley fields of western Asia . As the cultivation of wheat was carried farther north , or to higher altitudes , the hardier rye throve at the expense of the wheat . There are regions where the two are put in together : if the wheat fails in a bad year , there is at least a partial rye crop to fall back on . In still colder climates , rye , on account of its dependability , came to be sown pure as a crop in its own right . In the same way , oats seem to have begun as a weed in fields of emmer wheat . So with the fire drill . It is an uncertain enough implement ; in most primitive communities only the more adept individuals attempt to use it . It requires wood that is neither too hard nor too soft and is both seasoned and kept dry , and especially a rather delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely that anyone who noted that friction produces heat , and who deliberately attempted to apply the principle in the fire drill , would have succeeded . Without previous experience or teaching , it would be perhaps a thousand chances to one that the trial would fail and that our putative inventor would discard his invention . It seems much more probable that in the boring of a hole not only would warmth be felt , but sooner or later the ground-out wood dust would collect in a little heap and send up a wisp of smoke and show a glowing spark ; whereupon it would only be necessary to repeat the operation with a new purpose . Much the same holds for the other friction devices , fire plow , fire saw , and fire cord . While there is no proof that these inventions were actually made as unintended by-products , it is mechanically plausible that they were . In any event , it is inescapable that the " invention " had antecedents . The occasional part that accident plays among apes in the solution of problems that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That accident has an occasional hand in invention is certain , but its importance must not be overestimated . Without awareness of want or problem , favorable luck will be wasted . It is again true that states of mind determine inventions , in individuals and in societies . Only as against this background does accident become significant . 148 . INVENTION AND PLAY Inventions motivated by play impulses are fairly common . The old " high " bicycle , with a very large wheel , was purely an instrument of sport . When about 1890 the modern type , with two equal and smaller wheels , then called safety bicycle , began to appear , it was hailed with acclaim . Bicycle parades were  | held , bicycle racing became an intercollegiate sport , century runs were scheduled every Sunday , hundreds of clubs were organized , then federated into a great League of American Wheelmen . It was only later that the bicycle began seriously to be used as a means of getting around on business . From this position , in America , it was again partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe , where relatively few people have been able to afford motorcars of their own , the bicycle has remained standard as a middleclass means of local transportation . In 1944 , when the American forces reentered a western Europe denuded of railroads and gasoline , it was about the only civilian means of locomotion . The history of the automobile is parallel . It too began essentially as a vehicle of sport , luxury , and recreation . Ballooning , the first form of aviation , commenced partly as a scientific demonstration and partly as an adventure . The practical and economic utilization of all aircraft came much later . The first invention of the bow and arrow may fall into the same class . A bow must have passed beyond a certain threshold of effectiveness before it can have any utility as a weapon . It seems dubious whether any primitive , starting from nothing and thinking up a bow and arrow by insight , could give it the several points of efficiency needed for killing even a small animal . Besides , certain manipulative skills are required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a string release . Our hypothetical inventor out of the blue would therefore quite likely have given up his idea as unworkable on first actually trying it out . On the other hand , a string on a bent stick is under tension and will twang . Just such a " musical bow " is used by many primitive peoples as a sort of " Jews ' - harp " or jaws ' - harp , set against the teeth . The same strung stick could also be bounced in a game , or have sticks bounced off its string . From that it would be a short step to sliding or shooting light sticks at a near-by mark . Now , with something to build on , both in the way of a working instrument and manipulative skill , a little more strengthening or improvement of both bow and arrow would much more easily result in a workable weapon . This reconstruction is wholly speculative , and no assurance can be put on any step in the process outlined . The suggestion is merely that something of the sort is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in toto , at one stroke , seems overdifficult mechanically ; and the play factor , perhaps aided by accident , seems the most likely to have entered into the transitional stages . The influence of pattern , of existing similar forms , must also be reckoned with , as antecedents : not only a musical or game bow , but the spring trap or noose holding down a bent-over sapling . In both cases taut cords and the elasticity of wood are utilized . Unfortunately , we have no more actual knowledge of the origin of the sapling snare than of the bow . We do know that the bow as a weapon is not really early in prehistory . Its first record is late Palaeolithic or Mesolithic ( ? 274-276 ) , and it  | was preceded in Europe by a well-developed spear-thrower in the Magdalenian ( ? 269 ) . A second prehistoric instance is American . It has long been known that even the most advanced native cultures of the New World ? Aztec , Maya , Inca ? totally lacked several basic technological devices that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironworking , stringed musical instruments , plows , and wheels . ' In 1944 wheeled toys of pottery were reported from excavations in the Panuco River region in Mexico , near Tampico . They consisted of effigies of dogs with the paired legs perforated , presumably for insertion of a slender rod or reed , on the ends of each of which pierced pottery disks were jammed . The axles have decayed , but the baked clay figures and sets of disks remain . These are indubitable little four-wheel wagons in principle , though applied to toys ( or possibly cult objects ) on the order of the stuffed lambs or wooden horsies that our children drag around . Subsequently it was noted that similar pieces had previously been discovered scatteringly all the way from Michoacan to Panama . As compared with all the other instances here discussed , this case is incomplete . The principle of the device was achieved in play , but it failed to be applied for utility . Actually this nonuse of the wheel after its discovery makes native America stand out in sharper contrast with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexicans made the invention ; socially speaking , they refused it ? threw it away . Generically , all the discoveries and innovations of pure science and fine art ? those intellectual and aesthetic pursuits which are carried on without reference to technology or utility ? may be credited to functioning of the human play impulses . They are adult sublimations , onto a largely supermuscular level , of the sensorily exploratory and kinaesthetic activities that constitute play in children and mammals . They rest on the play impulse , which is connected with growth but is dissociated from preservation , comfort , or utility , and which in science and art is translated into the realm of imagination , abstraction , relations , and sensuous form . 149 . ANTECEDENTS The bow is of interest , not only because of its presumptive relation to play before utility , but also because it illustrates the necessity of antecedents to almost any invention . These antecedents , prerequisites , or conditions must be present ? both before an individual can make a workable invention , and before a culture can accept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because we men are by nature romantic and unhistorical-minded , and , except under intellectual discipline , we prefer and shape for ourselves emotion1 There were indigenous spindle whorls , but these were only disk buttons or weights on a rod twirled free by hand . They might at best be called near-wheels . The axle did not spin in a bearing , and the wheel edge engaged nothing .  | ally appealing stories of how inventions are brought about by sheer resolve , superhuman insight , dire necessity , or mere blind luck . On analysis every invention on which we have information proves to depend on antecedents , as regards both individual creation and social acceptance . The essential feature of the modern automobile is the propulsion of a wheeled vehicle by an explosion engine . Wheels were known for thousands of years , the explosion engine for decades , before the combination was made . It is completely certain that the idea of combining a vehicle and an explosion engine occurred to hundreds of men long before any automobile ever ran . The problem was not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit workably . This involved all sorts of complications , which had to be mastered gradually . We need not go into the mechanical complexities of transmission and gearshift ; simpler features will illustrate the point . To be effective , the gas explosion must occur in an enclosed chamber or cylinder against a piston whose plunge outward moves the machinery . How introduce an intermittent flame rapidly into this tight cylinder ? The most feasible answer is an electric spark , and this is what has chiefly been used in gasoline motorcars . It could be used when automobiles came along , because by then first static electricity , next current , and then electromagnetism had been discovered . Until these prior discoveries had been made , the principle or abstract idea of an automobile could have been invented , but hardly a car that ran . ' The difference is like that between Leonardo da Vinci 's dreams of flying machines and the Wright brothers ' realization at Kittyhawk . Leonardo merits high credit for his imagination ; but he was four centuries too early . His time could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed too few scientific and technical antecedents . Patents , by the way , are not issued for an idea , but for a specific device , process , or machine that is presumably workable , and which is concrete enough so that it can be drafted or a model can be supplied . If the Patent Office believes a proposed device to be unworkable , it refuses the patent . It is true that if a device includes a new idea , this idea also becomes protected by its patenting ; but only secondarily , by inclusion . It is easy to see why the law takes this stand . Without it , there would be a scramble to pre-empt all possible new ideas , largely by people incompetent to translate them into effective execution . Patents would be held by those working out combinations of words instead of working out parts of machines . The point is significant for the understanding of culture history . Sometimes the prerequisite antecedents are indirect and unexpectedly remote . The really first automobiles did not have gas engines , but were steamdriven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after i800 in England , long before the gas engine was invented . Some of these early road machines have been preserved and may be seen in the United States National Museum Annex . They 2 Some progressive dates are : workable gas engine , Otto , 1877 ; Selden basic patent , 1879 ; practical automobile , Serpollet in France , 1889 ; first gasoline motor of present motorcar type , Daimler , 1892.  | look something like monstrous steam rollers . Trevithick 's car of 1803 ran on the streets of London with 10-foot drive wheels . By 1823 tubular boilers had been introduced . These road cars were not a practical success , and for several reasons ; but one of the reasons was that roads were bad . Locomotives , which is what these contraptions really amounted to , were accordingly put on rails , where they no longer shook to pieces , could go much faster , and could better haul cars . Thus the steam railway was born about 1829 ; is really was a transfer from the idea of the free-ranging automobile , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rails was much older than that of self-moving engines . Wooden rails for hand-pushed cars are said to have been used in small-scale mining operations in Germany as early as 1546 , and certainly were used before 1700 at Newcastle ; iron-shod ones in 1716 , and cast-iron ones in 1767 , all these last in England . Passengers were hauled in horse-drawn cars on rails near London in 18oi ? the same year that Trevithick carried them in a steam-driven locomotive ? a full twenty-eight years before Stephenson 's steam locomotive proved practicable on the Liverpool-Manchester rail line . It should be added that several factors were involved in the nonsuccess of the early road locomotives . In England , where industry had become heavier and more mobile than in France , and roads were far better than in America , the directors and promoters of steam railways exerted competitive pressure as soon as the railways had proved successful and were promising to make money . Beginning as early as 1832 , they induced turnpike trustees to exact prohibitive tolls from road machines . When this was not sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any road engine-vehicle ? a rule that was not relaxed in England until 1896 , when the gas-engine automobile was already successfully racing across France . Such blocking of the development of inventions by use of influence is not mere wickedness . The railroads did represent a growing investment , much larger than any for road machines ; and money is like life in seeking self-protection . Indeed , the early railway-builders were genuinely farsighted in their fears , as the later automotive competition beginning in the decade 1920-30 was to show . A weakness of railways is that they involve heavy capital for right of way , roadbed , track , and maintenance , and that they reach only a limited number of points . Recognition of the desirability of a mechanical vehicle that could range freely on all roads was therefore bound to recur . Shortly before 1900 , the immediate ancestors of our modern automobile began to appear , in three forms . One used the newer explosion engine already discussed ; another , the old steam engine , though in a shape extremely light for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a storage-battery electric motor . For years the three forms competed , until the gas engine won out through greater adaptability to most demands . One thing , however , helped the modern automobile , even in its infancy , as against its precursor of a century before : the solid rubber tire , which cased some of the jolts as speed increased . This tire had come in  | toward the end of the horse-and-buggy days for pleasure vehicles : " Bring out your rubber-tired hacks . " Soon the hollow , inflated rubber tire took its place ; this had developed with the low or safety bicycle a decade or so before , and had there proved its advantage and feasibility . Without rubber and pneumatic tires , the automobile would have had to take a racking pounding at speeds of more than six or eight miles an hour on most roads of that time ; but now the automobile 's tires were awaiting it . Undoubtedly if tires had not been ready , they would soon have been developed ; but the progress of the automobile would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A simple case of antecedents , though an ancient one , is the calendar , which could not have been devised without recorded observations and counts . Reference is to a genuine calendar that recognizes a specified number of days and of moon appearances within the year , and attempts to reconcile the three factors ? days , moons , year ? which are not related in integral numbers . Even if such a calendar is only approximately true , it must be preceded by observations whose cumulative count is carried on for many years , probably for several lifetimes . This in turn involves some system of notation or record . Hence any complex calendar can hardly be expected to have preceded writing by very long . Greek astronomy underwent a splendid development for some centuries , then slowed and ceased progress . The Greeks had no real clocks with gears , pendulum , or escapement . They had only water clocks depending on drip , and sundials . They knew optics and the lens in principle rather than in practice , because they do not seem to have ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observational instruments were of the simplest . Looking back now , it is evident that Greek intellect and imagination had developed astronomy about as far as they were able to until clocks and telescopes were available ? and , let us add , until a mathematics with a computationally efficient number-symbol system like our positional " Arabic " numerals was also available . It was by lack of these antecedents that the further progress of Greek astronomy was necessarily checked . As a matter of fact , when basic progress in astronomy began to be made again , it was by Copernicus and his successors some centuries after clocks ( ? 184 ) and position numerals ( ? 189 ) and algebra were in use . Within another century the telescope was invented ( ? 152 ) and was immediately utilized by Galileo and others . Similarly , contemporary astronomy builds largely on the photography and the spectroscope that the nineteenth century devised . 150 . CUMULATIVE AND COMPLEX INVENTIONS So important is this matter of antecedents that it is often difficult to determine reliably just what constitutes an invention or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyzed , the larger do the antecedents loom , and by comparison the less outstanding does the new step or increment appear . This is contrary to the popular view , which condenses a complex and gradual process into a single  | dramatic act by one individual , with whom we can identify ourselves emotionally . Hence the anecdotes about Newton and the apple , or Watt and his mother 's teakettle , which we are taught as children . We profess not to believe these stories seriously , but they nevertheless tend to influence our thinking . It is true that there is always insight at work when something new is devised or understood . It is no doubt also true that usually it is great men , genuinely superior individuals , who have these insights . But there is also a long chain of antecedents involved , in every case of which we have knowledge , without which the insight and genius could have done nothing in the given situation . This intricate and largely impersonal build-up is precisely the anthropologist 's or the historian 's business to elucidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horribly unromantic , and the lay mind shrinks from it , just as a child could not grasp it . The popular mind loves being off duty as regards criticism and skepticism , and has invested the whole matter of invention with an atmosphere of fascinating mystery . It imagines a great intellect rushing along out of nothing like a new comet out of space , and making a complete invention at one stroke . The more inexplicable this is , the more satisfying it is as a daydream story . In reality , however , we may say that most so-called inventions are not a single act but a cumulative series of transmitted increments plus ' 1 series of new elements when these become possible in the culture in which they appear . Kuznets neatly demonstrated this rule in a type study of the plow sulky . This is a plow with wheels . The addition of the wheels undoubtedly made ' t a new kind of plow , which we can define , and distinguish from other plows . Kuznets went over data extracted from United States patent records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with plow sulkies ? new parts , improvements , refinements . Each year after the initiating invention in 1865 the number of new patents grew more rapidly , then began to level off , reached a peak around 1882 , then diminished , declined rapidly , and dwindled away by 1923 . There was little more to perfect on the plow sulky , and inventiveness turned to replacing it by new types of plows . The year-by-year curve of additions to and improvements of the plow sulky suggests a somewhat skew " normal " frequency distribution . Now it can not be maintained that all inventions develop as regularly as this . A physical or an economic catastrophe may come along and chop off the curve ; or a new and subversive invention may displace a still growing one . The line of development would also look different if one chose a wider category , say plows in general . In that case the line would be a composite of the curves for inventions of handled plow , share plow , plow sulky , disk plow , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with many minor fluctuations . Also , in the absence of Patent Office records , we can not be sure of the precise growth of many inventions . Yet what analysis of the plow-sulky history does show is that many inventions are not single acts of mind , but  | cumulative results . They are social events , and therefore they usually are gradual events . In the last analysis , the fundamental invention in the plow sulky was the combination of two antecedents , the plow and the wheel , and two very old antecedents at that . The rest of the history of the invention consists of improvements and modifications ; in other words , developments or consequences of the original combination . A great deal of invention seems to boil down to just that . The more analytically facts are gone into , the more difficult is it to isolate many really basic inventions . More and more do they resolve into combinations of old elements , or into modifications that are reapplications of other old elements . What is new is often a new function , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which we can name . Such are the plow sulky and the automobile , the bow and arrow , and the fire drill . Mechanically , it is often hard to delimit an invention . The mechanical principle or structure of the shooting bow is the same as that of the drill bow , the game bow , the mouthharp bow . The bow becomes a bow when it is shot as a weapon . It is its use , its human function , that makes it a weapon , its name , " bow and arrow , " that gives it entity . For most of us , other than engineers and inventors , the cultural history of the bow is more significant than its mechanical history . Similarly with the automobile . Mechanically , the early nineteenth-century steam road-locomotives were motorcars or automobiles , as much so as a White Steamer of 1908 or a Chevrolet of 1948 . But they failed to be successful , they went out , and culturally the history of what we call the automobile begins in the decade before 1900 when flash-boiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 151 . SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE This brings us to the matter of social acceptance of inventions . We may lay it down as a definition that , anthropologically , sociologically , and historically , an invention is not an invention until it is accepted in a culture . Until then it exists merely individually or mechanically ; it actualizes historically only with its social acceptance . It is notorious that a great many successful inventions have been claimed by and for different nations . Which is the right one is often difficult to decide . Where nationalism enters into the problem , it becomes still more difficult . Asked who the inventor of the steamship was , the average American will answer Fulton ; the Britisher , Symington ; the Frenchman , Jouffroy . A Spaniard may even propose Blasco de Garay , who is wholly mythical as regards the steamboat . Each is reacting to what he has been taught . But Fulton had well-known predecessors , both American and European . The story is set forth in fuller detail in ? 185-186 , but it might be said here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced people that it was or could be made economically successful . Historically , the definition of the inventor as the man  | who makes a utilitarian invention pay , or succeeds in persuading others that it will pay , has a great deal to be said for it , especially in our contemporary civilization with its heavy economic and technological slant . For all times and places the definition is a bit narrow , since some successful innovations do not yield a money profit , and some cultures have neither money nor profit . Broadened accordingly , the definition reads that an invention is only potential while its idea remains in the head of an individual , but that it becomes actualized when it begins to be socially accepted into a culture . The bars to adoption are of several kinds . First there is the direct economic preventive . We know how to extract gold from the ocean , or power from the tides , but it costs more , in money , to extract them than the gold and the power are worth . Then there is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of flying machines . In 1500 Europe was technologically not far enough along to execute his ideas . Next is the factor of resistance . A new religion usually encounters an established one . An attempt to induce Americans to eat taro meal for breakfast failed because they already had fixed eating habits and a sufficiency and variety of foods , so an unexciting novelty made no appeal . An efficient private express system may block institution of a public parcel post , or vice versa . The two are competitive in serving nearly the same ends , and economic , political , or monopolistic pressure will be directed against the newcomer . Finally , there are innovations that may seem intrinsically desirable to nearly everyone , but which are bound to exact a heavy toll of temporary confusion and disorganization : a radical reform of the calendar or the alphabet , for instance , as discussed in ? 170 and 212 . Converse conditions of course further the adoption of changes . An established religion that has lost its hold , chronic food shortages , times of distress when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally include innovations and long-delayed inventions . A cultural novelty always encounters existing cultural conditions , and it is these which determine whether , when , how , and in what form it gets adopted . These preconditions of course are so variable from instance to instance that it is difficult to attribute the acceptance of particular inventions to their intrinsic merit . In the realm of machines there certainly is something pretty close to intrinsic or absolute merit , in the degree of physical fitness , efficiency , and economy . But even as between machines , their acceptance is always in part conditioned by their relation to the local culture in which they are invented or into which they are introduced . Witness the story of the steamboat in ? 185 , I n nonmechanical matters , innovations are of course even more influenced by the culture they are trying to enter . In this matter of their fate , or at any rate their date , being determined by the cultural soil on which they fall , inventions from inside a society and diffusions from outside it ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SIMULTANEOUS INVENTIONS AGAIN The frequent simultaneity of inventions has been discussed in ? 140 as a manifestation of pattern growth , but it is obviously also a matter of antecedents . If the prerequisites for an invention are lacking , it can not be realized , even if the idea should crop up . On the contrary , once the prerequisites have been supplied , if desirability of a contrivance continues to be felt , a whole series of individuals are likely to work on the problem , so that the prospects are considerable that two or more of them will find a feasible solution . In familiar metaphor , we say that the discovery is now in the air , or that the time is ripe for it . More precisely , inventions are culturally determined . Such a statement must not be given a mystical connotation . It does not mean , for instance , that it was predetermined from the beginning of time that type printing would be discovered in Germany about 1450 , or the telephone in the United States in 1876 . Determinism in this connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific condition of a given culture and the making of a particular invention . The history of science is full of instances . Sunspots were first discovered in 1611 , independently and in different countries , by Galileo , Harriott , Scheiner , and Fabricius . The specific antecedent is highly definite : the telescope was devised in 16o8 . The telescope , in turn , has three claimants to its invention . All three were Dutch , probably because the manufacture of lenses was developed farthest in Holland at the time . Only a little later , Spinoza , now remembered as one of the great philosophers , was earning his daily bread as a lens-grinder . The compound microscope also originated in Holland ; and the discoveries through it of animalculae , egg development , blood circulation , insect anatomy , and the like were made later in the 1600 's by two other Dutchmen , Leeuwenhoek and Swammerdam . All this means that the culture of seventeenth-century Holland included a pattern in which lenses figured with more weight than elsewhere . In short , the Dutch were lens-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telescope , and this in turn was the antecedent to the discovery of sunspots . To a certain extent we may even speak legitimately of the inevitability of inventions ? provided we mean by this nothing more than that , given an existing sense of the desirability of a conceivable device , and the presence of the needed antecedents , the device will necessarily be invented soon . Given enough knowledge of optics , technological skill in making lenses , and astronomical curiosity , sunspots and the moons of Jupiter will be discovered promptly ? if not by Galileo , then by someone else . Given knowledge of electric current and electromagnetic induction and of sound vibration ? especially with telegraphs in successful operation for thirty years ? and the idea of the telephone is bound to occur to a number of technicians . It is only a question of who will first work the idea out feasibly . Will it be Bell or Gray in 1876 , or someone else in 1877  | or 1878 or perhaps as early as 1875 ? To the individual inventor the " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the prize . To his society , and to the world at large , the " Who ? " is really a matter of indifference ? except for sentimental partisanship ? because the invention was going to be made anyway about when and where it was made . We can not always see this fact at the moment , and still less can we judge in advance whether all the necessary antecedents have been gone through with and the economic requirements satisfied . But after the event , especially at some little perspective from it ? provided it is not so long ago that the record has again begun to get dim or lost ? we can recognize the piling-up of the antecedents until the invention or the innovation follows as their consequence . See for instance the histories of mills , of the steamship , of the telegraph and telephone , in another chapter ( ? 183-187 ) . This view of the inevitability of inventions is now pretty generally accepted . That it is not yet common popular knowledge is due to the persistence of what may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one denies that there are great men and that they do great things . The fallacy is to infer from this that everything important in history must have had a great man as its specific cause From the fact that the telegraph and the telephone are extremely important in the mechanics of modern living , it does not follow that Morse and Bell were outstandingly great men ; though obviously they were more than mediocrities . ' It is the personalizing , anthropomorphizing habits of nonscientific thinking that lead us loosely to assume not only that such men were supremely great , but that they were so much greater than all their contemporaries that we might still be doing without the benefits of their inventions if they had not been considerate enough to make them . This is patently absurd , since they had rivals treading on their heels , and in fact sometimes stepping out ahead . Let us examine another instance or two , where the circumstances are unusually clear . We have seen ( ? 140 ) that Alfred Russell Wallace was the independent codiscoverer in 1858 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection as a mechanism explaining the change and origin of species and therewith of continuous evolution . At that time Darwin had had the idea for twenty years , and had discussed it with a few of his friends ; but , not sufficiently winning their approval , he hesitated to publish until his hand was forced by Wallace . Suppose that Darwin had died during his two decades of indecision . Wallace 's would almost certainly be the name now on our tongues . Suppose he too had ( lied , say in 1857 . Does it seem more likely that in that event biologists would have gone on indefinitely believing in special creation for each species ? Or that within a few years some third man would have had the concept of natural selection occur to him and have announced it ? The idea of evolution was " in the air " ? as a matter of fact it was more than that , Herbert Spencer having developed it before Wallace and Darwin . Their explanation after all is only that 3 Morse was also an able portrait-painter.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic evolution is supposed to have worked . Darwin 's grandfather Erasmus , and Lamarck , had already had the idea of developmental transformation . It is evident that natural selection was really a link in a chain , one idea among several whose union made a broad system of evolutionistic thought possible . All of which together would seem to build up to this : that science and philosophy having got where they were in western Europe around 1858 , it was inevitable that the notion of natural selection should be thought up by someone within a very few years of 186o at the latest . By contrast we have Aristotle actually imagining and mentioning the idea of natural selection as something logically thinkable , but immediately dismissing it as something not worth testing against evidence . The Greek way of thinking favored the finite and the definite ; its world view was not evolutionistic . The set of the culture pattern ? the " spirit " of the Greek times ? was against anything like natural selection , and so it was rejected , and remained out for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did can be credited to Aristotle as a mark of his individual genius . But his rejection of it is not to his personal discredit , because that was the result of his Greek environment and social heritage . The case of Mendel , founder of the science of genetics , is extraordinary because his genius almost did never get recognized . In 1866 Mendel published in the proceedings of a learned society at Brno an account of his experimental breeding of peas . In this he announced the basic quantitative laws of heredity , and correctly : they have been much elaborated since but still stand . Except for the Swiss botanist Nageli , who went unheeded , no one took any notice . Darwin , Galton , and hundreds of other biologists were studying heredity , but they either missed seeing Mendel 's paper or failed to realize its significance . Surely this is a case of the time being not yet ripe : Mendel was ahead of it . He died in 1884 as an abbot , but scientifically an obscure person . In fact , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his discovery that he is said to have abandoned belief in it himself . Then , a generation later , in 1900 , within three months three biologists , the Dutchman De Vries , the German Correns , the Austrian Tschermak , who were studying heredity , and evidently were now severally approaching the point of view that Mendel had reached in the sixties , made his discovery over again ( ? 140 ) , and clicked to its importance . Correns also rediscovered Mendel 's forgotten publication , and announced it . Literally and personally , the Mendelian laws thus date from 1866 ; culturally and socially , from 1900 . From the angle of understanding human history and the workings of civilization , which is the effective date ? This array of evidence may seem to depreciate the great man , to make him merely a function of his culture . This is both so and not so . As compared with popular thinking , it is largely true , because popular thinking wants to dramatize and build plots around conquering heroes . But recognition of cultural forces  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or individual superiority . They can and do coexist . We can be sure that no important invention is ever made by a dub . If he made one by accident , he would not know it ; but some more intelligent person might see the significance and communicate it , thereby becoming the real discoverer . We can be just as sure that there are superior individuals , whom we call highly talented and geniuses , as that there are inferior ones who are incompetent and unintelligent . It is the talented and the geniuses who make inventions . But they make them only when and if their cultures permit ; and they make only the specific inventions that their cultures allow , within a narrow range . Other inventions have already been made , and still others are as yet impossible , given the culture as it is . Biography is a recognized literary genre , which has usually been assumed to have a laudatory purpose , and of late has tended frankly to assume semifictional dress . Biographers thus are free to cut out any cultural analyses that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or again to admit bits of culture as picturesque background . If however our purpose is to understand the history of human civilization , the cultural factors loom as decisive , just because they are the larger determinants . They determine what , where , and largely when and how . The individual determines the precise date , the particular manner or coloring of the event , and the mnemonic label of his personality and name . 153 . INVENTION OF INSTITUTIONS At the bottom of every invention there is an idea or a principle , whether formulated or not . Fundamentally , therefore , invention is one in kind , whether it relates to implements and machines or to institutions and beliefs . When a concept like that of divine kingship first appears in human history , it is , in our sense of a new idea , an invention , though an anonymous one . We know nothing of the inventor or the circumstances that led him to originate the idea , but it exercised a profound influence on millions of men from ancient Egypt to modern Japan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but a fragmentary survival . This king-godship became one of the bases of an extensive **27;516;TOOLONG system or major type of culture in protohistoric times ( ? 286 ) . The first sure record of the invention 's being accepted is in Egypt . It must have been a startlingly original invention ? first to conceive that a human being was a god and then to persuade people to believe it . Among modern institutional inventions may be mentioned the form of ballot that is officially prepared , marked in privacy , but deposited under control : a system devised to minimize intimidation and fraud . It originated in Australia , whence its name after its spread to the United States . There are also the initiative and the referendum , which come from Switzerland . Their roots are mediaeval , in the small cantons where every citizen could personally participate in government , much as in a Greek democratic city-state  | or a New England town meeting . In modern form , the referendum was first worked out by the minute , rural , and conservative canton of Schwyz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal , and urban Zurich accepted it in 1869 . Five years later it was written into the Swiss federal constitution ; and in 1891 the initiative followed . South Dakota in 1898 was the first American state to adopt both institutions . An American contribution is the written constitution . There were Magna Cartas and the like before , but they were essentially confirmations of concession or privilege . The American constitution was an attempt not to modify or retain , but to create a new political order , and in unambiguous terms free from the interpretations of usage or custom . It took over from existing English practice certain features , such as the bicameral legislature . But it developed as a new feature the differentiation of representation in the two Houses of Congress ? by political units and by population size . Also new was the explicit co-ordination of the executive , legislative , and judicial branches of government . But perhaps the most radical innovation of the American constitution was its outrightly creating the basic foundation of a political structure . By contrast , the English constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unwritten : it is a sort of direction followed through centuries of development . The American constitution , on the contrary , being made up at one stroke , had to be explicit and written out . The parallel shows that conscious , abrupt efforts toward production of new culture form and content may have functions and results closely similar to semiconscious , gradual efforts , and that as processes the two may intergrade . Analogous to these political inventions are socioeconomic ones such as banks , credit , double-entry bookkeeping , social security and old-age pensions , installment mortgages . There is no difference in principle . All these institutional inventions cited spread widely . In fact it is their spread beyond the point of origin that has made them historically important . In thus showing invention and diffusion as closely associated , the cases are typical . Just as an invention becomes culturally significant only upon its social acceptance , so an innovation by one population obviously becomes significant in world civilization in proportion as it is accepted by other populations . 154 . INVENTION BY STIMULUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is interesting because diffusion and invention enter into it equally . It can be called either stimulus invention or idea diffusion . In ordinary diffusion , as of the just-mentioned Australian ballot or the automobile , both the principle and its mechanism are taken over by a receiving culture from the inventing one . Occasionally , however , there are difficulties about acceptance of the mechanism , or the mechanism has not been fully learned . The idea or principle may then also fail to be accepted . But again , the idea may exercise an appeal that causes it to penetrate . An effort  | may then be made in the receiving culture to devise another mechanism that will produce the desired result . Thus an invention , or reinvention , is stimulated by contact transmission or diffusion . It is in the nature of such events that they tend to leave little historical trace of the processes at work . But there is documented evidence of several cases , and there are a number of probable ones . Porcelain is a pottery containing a feldspar clay , kaolin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of only on the surface like a glaze , and hence is brilliant , hard , and waterproof . The Chinese gradually evolved porcelain around rioo after a long series of groping experiments . In these stepby-step inventions accident may well have played a part , as well as blind trials . By the time Europeans came into direct sea contact with China soon after 1500 , the porcelain art was highly developed there . Its products were brought to Europe and admired ; but they were costly . Attempts to imitate porcelain were made , but with only partial success . This was because European ceramics were still only in the stage of development of Chinese ceramics some centuries before : they operated with surface glazes . The seventeenth-century delftware , and similar developments , represent this incomplete European imitation . Finally deposits of the necessary ingredient kaolin were found in Europe , the techniques were mastered , and in 1708-09 true porcelain was reinvented by Bottger and Tschirnhaus in Dresden . That is why we eat off " china " plates today . But without a mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have had nothing to shoot at , and conceivably they might not have devised porcelain until much later . In the early nineteenth century a half-breed Indian called Sequoya in his native Cherokee , and John Guest by white people , realized the value of writing . He was illiterate . Perhaps this is what made it seem desirable to him that his people should possess an instrument comparable to that of the white man . Had he been sent to an American school he would probably have been content to write English as a substitute . He wrestled with the problem for years . Finally , about 1821 , he evolved a Cherokee writing of which his fellow tribesmen were at first incredulous , but which proved to be entirely adequate and simple to learn , and which they adopted and used . The characters are derived from English : in fact Sequoya had in his house a spelling primer , which he could not read , but many of whose letters he used for his own purpose with entirely different values . Eighteen of the Cherokee characters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inverted capitals ; a few are lower-case letters or numerals ; about a third or a quarter of the total of 86 are freely invented . That Sequoya 's feat was however a genuine and singlehanded invention is shown by two facts . Not one of the characters has the same value as in English ; and all the characters denote syllables , not letter sounds . Thus A is read as " go " in Cherokee , B as " ya , " C as " tli , " D as " a . " We have thus a true and real invention , with a high degree of originality ; and yet we also have the assurance  | that but for the influence and example of the alien culture , the invention would never have been made . It is another instance of " antecedents , " though unusual ones . An entirely parallel invention of writing was made by a West-coast African , shortly before 1849 , for his native Vai language . He had had a bit of missionary schooling in his youth ; but he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is also a syllabary , as against the alphabetic system of English that had stimulated him . But the number of characters is over 200 , and they bear no resemblance to English , nor of course to Cherokee . The names of primitive inventors are rarely known , so this one is cited : Doalu Bukere . Stimulus diffusion accordingly is also stimulus invention . Therein lies its interest . This is perhaps not one of the most frequent processes in culture . However , its nature is such that its results look wholly novel and original even when they are not ; and the factors involved tend not to get into the historical record and often become quickly forgotten . The number of occurrences of the process may thus be considerably larger than appears . Several instances can be cited in which derivation by diffusion has actually been suggested by one and another culture historian without their being able to find direct evidence of the derivation . Yet the resemblances and the space-time tie-up are such that the operative mechanism may quite possibly have been reinvention stimulated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are : The seemingly independent invention of pottery by the early Basket MakerPueblo ( Anasazi ) in northern Arizona-New Mexico at a time when pottery surely was already being made in central Mexico ( Archaic ) and perhaps in southern Arizona ( Hohokam ; see ? 323 ) Monks in Christianity , some centuries later than Buddhist monasticism , with convents , celibacy , begging , and tonsure Development of Greek grammar some centuries after Sanskrit grammar , and of Japanese two centuries after Latin and Dutch contacts In converse direction , Sanskrit drama following the Greek Quantitative meter appearing in Arabic poetry , and then by known transfer in Persian and Turkish , after it had long been established in Greek and Latin None of these can at present be either proved or disproved as examples of stimulus diffusion , but there seems an inherent probability that some of them may turn out demonstrably to be such . 155 . INVENTION BY REDUCTION-SEGREGATION In general , more invention means more machines and more institutions  - -  more physical and social apparatus to be handled . This somewhat dismaying prospect is partly relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tion or reduction . Perhaps " extraction " or " segregation " more nearly describes the process . Metaphorically it would be a sort of curdling or clotting-out . The most striking case is the alphabet ( ? zo6 and 207 ) . Previous systems 3f writings consisted of idea signs , word signs , syllable signs , and , in the case of Egyptian , of sound signs also 02o2-2o5 ) . Moreover , a word might be spelled out according to its sound and then an ideogram for it be added , as if to make pure that one representation would be read if the other were missed ? see the example in Figure 20 . Not only was the writing of particular words cumbersome , but each method of writing required several hundred symbols . Thus Egyptian hieroglyphic comprised 46o characters , cuneiform Babylonian around Soo , Indus Valley writing nearly 400 . As against this , the true alphabet rests upon he realization that if pure minimum-sound symbols ? true letters ? are con-  | sistently used , all the characters for syllables , words , objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be discarded ; and anything that can be spoken can also be written , and with complete intelligibility , by means of from two to three dozen simple signs . It took two thousand years for this realization to be achieved . In one sense the cardinal quality required by the inventors of the alphabet was resolution , the courage to break with the multiple reinsurance of ways of denoting meaning that was characteristic of the older mixed **33;545;TOOLONG systems . In a rough sort of sense , the invention was like a cripple 's finding he could walk free when he threw his crutches away . If the Egyptians missed a bet by failing to discard all their writing symbols except their 24 true letter-signs scattered among the rest , they did achieve another mental simplification : the invention of a pure solar calendar ( ? 291 ) . The " natural " tendency seems to be to take cognizance of time by nights and days , by moons and their phases , and finally by years and their recurrent seasons . The difficulty bred by this is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the sun do not gear . There are more than twelve lunations in a year , but considerably less than thirteen . They average a bit over 29%2 days , so that a twelve-moon year is nearly 11 days short . A rough correction can be made by putting a thirteenth month into every third year . Yet not only does this have the inconvenience of the years being quite unequal , but the correction is still short by three and a fraction days . More elaborate intercalations are more accurate , but also more cumbersome . But no such system can be wholly accurate , because earth and moon revolutions are incommensurable . Hence the Chinese , Mohammedan , and ritual Jewish calendars , which really observe the moon , are always beginning the year at a different absolute and seasonal date . The simplification made by the early Egyptians consisted in disregarding what the moon was actually doing , and substituting months ? arbitrary periods of thirty days . There were always twelve of these in the year , plus five supplementary days ; and the Egyptian year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same seasonal or astronomical time ? except for the few hours ' gain that we correct by a leap day . We still follow the Egyptian plan of months ' being independent of the physical moon and its phases , though we do not use the supplemental days , and we have our months of unequal length ? " Thirty days hath September , " and so on . The cardinal act in the devising of the Egyptian calendar , and a feature that we retain , was the discarding of the moon 's revolution from any relation to the earth 's revolution or year . Another example of the process is the way in which astronomy and astrology were originally associated in one system in Mesopotamia , as discussed below in connection with the origin of the week ( ? 196-197 ) . It used to be thought that the segregation was effected wholly by the Greeks , who discarded the omens and portents and developed the pure science . It is now known that in late Mesopotamian days , after the fall of Assyria and especially after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine or pure astronomy in Babylonia on which the Greeks were more dependent ? both for observation and for interpretation ? than their selfcenteredness had led us to believe . But however the credit may fall between the two nationalities , they did manage to curdle a purely naturalistic science out from a previous amorphous , **30;580;TOOLONG mass of knowledge and beliefs regarding the heavenly bodies . This astronomy maintained itself for a number of centuries ; but about the time it stopped progressing , by Roman Imperial times , it was reinvaded by a new wave of magic . This was astrology , of the type still followed by a remnant of the mystically inclined and the credulous among ourselves . The earlier Mesopotamians had been concerned mostly with eclipses as portents . The later astrology crystallized chiefly at Alexandria and dealt with the continuous fortunes of men as determined by the positional relations of the planets , or rather of the seven moving heavenly bodies visible to the human eye . From then on until about s600 astronomy was astrologyridden , among ancients , Arabs , and Europeans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some were ardent over it . It was close to 1700 before scientists were once more unanimous in repudiating astrology as wholly nonscientific . The relations of alchemy and chemistry were similar except that here there was no ancient attempt at autonomy of a self-sufficient science . The result was that a wholly naturalistic chemistry never emerged as a productive and systematic activity anywhere until in the most recent centuries of European civilization . The magico-mystic ingredients in alchemy were the elixir of life , the philosopher 's stone , and the transmutation of metals into gold . The search for these transcendentals was not calculated to encourage preoccupation with ordinary " base " substances and their humble quantitative properties . In the West , alchemy first appeared in the turgid atmosphere of Imperial Roman Alexandria about contemporaneously with planetary astrology . ' In the East , substantially identical beliefs were rampant in China apparently a little earlier , during the first half of the Han period of 2o6 R.C.-A.D. 220 . Alchemy still had some repute in Europe as late as the sixteenth century . The type of inventive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by Toynbee . The connotations of that word seem inappropriate , and perhaps unfortunate . But it is evident that the process deserves a name . It is not a process of outright specialization , though it somewhat resembles differentiation by specialization . For instance , medicine begins with general practice , from which after a time eye-ear-nose-throat treatments separate off . With added knowledge , instruments , and skills , certain doctors begin to limit themselves to the eye and are called oculists . The remainder for a while go on as a unit , but in time the aurists perhaps again split off as specialists . In * This is the usual version . Another interpretation makes the Alexandrians crude ; Itemists concerned with producing deceptive imitations of gold . Both accounts may be true .  | this medical specialization there is no discarding or repudiation of one element or ingredient ; they are all developed further , and therewith it became advantageous and desirable for individuals to choose among the subspecialties . In the process here discussed , however , the essential step is that an encumbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got rid of . There is accordingly a reduction of total compass of a system or activity through a segregation of its more valuable or efficient elements from its inferior or impeding ones . Apparently , a process somewhat reminiscent of this reduction-segregation is observable in technology . In the main this technological happening is obscured by the fact that many machines grow more complex as they develop , because their functions and powers increase . But as each kind of machine approaches the limits of its inherent possibilities as a type , it tends to revert to simplicity , to emphasize economy of means , and to achieve what engineer and artist would agree in calling beauty of design and function . An example in point is the clipper ship coming to its peak in the very days when steam was beginning to supersede sails . The superb swords of Japan in an era of cannon are another instance . We have here a field of social process that has been inadequately explored , but in which interesting possibilities can be glimpsed. 156 . CULTURAL LOSS Popular romance maintains a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hardening of copper to equal steel , miraculously lifelike embalming of mummies , and the like . Actually , it is likely that no art of serious consequence has been lost from total human civilization . Copper can be hardened by alloys most of which the ancients did not possess ; it can be somewhat hardened by hammering , a quality which we know as well as they did but do not utilize precisely because we have very much harder steel . Lenin 's body in Moscow is probably preserved much better than any Egyptian master embalmer would have known how to preserve it . And so on . There is considerable cultural " loss " that is actual , but it relates to particular cultures rather than to human culture as a whole . Most of it , as will be seen presently , is displacement , properly speaking : a new custom , art , worship , or belief crowds out an old one . Utilitarian arts , such as hardening copper , dyeing with cochineal or with Tyrian shellfish , retire to a humble spot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of what we shall have to consider as cultural " losses " possess this character of replacement or displacement . In addition , particular societies do at times undergo genuine or downright losses of specific items of their culture , owing to environment , loss of materials or skills , shrinkage of population , impoverishment , and other or unknown causes . Some instances of both kinds will be briefly analyzed.  | 157 . DISAPPEARANCE OF USEFUL ARTS In 1912 Rivers demonstrated a series of convincing examples of the disappearance of useful arts in Oceania . The things given up were of unquestionable utility : canoes , pots , bows . The canoe went out of use in Torres Island in Melanesia , was replaced by sailing rafts in Mangareva . In a series of Melanesian islands ? Malikolo , Pentecost , Lepers , Ambrym ? potsherds are found in the ground , but pottery has not been made in the historical period . In several areas the bow was still known recently , but it was used only as a toy , in sport , or in small-game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in war . These areas of fighting without bow and arrow covered nearly all Polynesia except Tonga and Samoa ; in Melanesia , most of New Britain , New Ireland , and the Admiralties ; and some of the coast of New Guinea . The causes of the several disappearances were various . Lack of material was the least common cause . It would be applicable chiefly to canoes , but was not the reason for abandonment in either Torres or Mangareva . Sometimes the guilds or families of tohunga or craftsmen who had been taught magic as well as manual skills by their elders died out . This happened to the canoemakers in the Torres Islands , and to the stone-adz producers in Woodlark . Sometimes in Oceania a single community specializes in manufacturing one article , such as pots , and supplying it by trade to a large area . A catastrophe overwhelming such a village might result in the whole area 's coming to use wooden vessels instead of pottery . As to the bow , there was generally no large game in the Oceanic islands to sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there generally was enough , but it was sometimes ceremonial rather than waged for practical advantage . And in Polynesia war tended to be dominated by standards of bravery , chivalry , or manners of fighting : fashion exalted the hand-to-hand club . All in all , the array of cases is significant in showing that the actual historical behavior of cultures can not be predicted from an a-priori notion that practical utility ? economic motivation ? is invariably determinative . ' There also are conditions of natural environment under which particular utilitarian activities can wither away fast . In 1818 the explorer Ross discovered some two hundred Eskimo along the east shore of Smith Sound in northern Greenland ? later also named Peary 's Eskimo , or Eta or Polar Eskimo , because they live farthest north of any permanent human community , at Igita beyond latitude 78 ? . Ice and cliffs had long cut them off so effectually that they no 5 One consideration that Rivers did not stress is that the Oceanian continent of native Australia also lacked canoes , pottery , and bows , and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having possessed and lost , but of never having had the inventions ? in the main perhaps of not wanting them ( see ? 253 , 310 ) . Nevertheless , the proximity of Australia to New Guinea , Melanesia , and Polynesia makes it seem that the two negative distributions may be connected , according to the principles of distributional evidence set forth in ? 223-224.  | longer had clear knowledge of any other people . They possessed no kayaks ? the decked-over boats of skins stretched on a light wooden frame which were so widely prevalent among the Eskimo that it is assumed that all once had them . This group lacked them because driftwood does not carry into Smith Sound . From 1818 on , they got wood from Ross , and from subsequent explorers and whalers ; but still they made no kayaks : they no longer knew how . About 1868 a vigorous , restless Baffinland Eskimo took his family , pushed north with sledges , crossed Smith Sound on the winter ice , and found a new home among the Polar Eskimo . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region of driftwood and knowledge of the kayak taught them how to make it . During the fifty years preceding this Bafl'inlander 's coming the Polar Eskimo had again got the necessary material through the whites . But this had not helped them , because the design and art of joining a seaworthy frame had been forgotten in the preceding centuries of their isolation . Technological skills can generally be taught only imperfectly by words . There must be visible example and , above all , manual practice . That is one reason why the teaching of chemistry and other science insists on laboratory periods . Useful technologies do not tend intrinsically to disappear faster than other parts of culture ; the weak link in the matter of transmission of technologies lies in the acquirement of manipulative practice , the formation of motor habits . Interfere with these and the continuity of the art is broken and may be lost . It was a deficiency of environment that was at the bottom of the Polar Eskimo 's losing their boatbuilding ability . But having once lost the skill , the fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to reinvent the art . And meanwhile their lack of boats helped to pen them in their habitat . However , nature gave the Polar Eskimo something else . Three large meteorites , now carried to New York City , had fallen in their habitat . From these they managed to whack off slivers of nickel-iron with stones ; these they beat to an edge and set end to end in a groove in a bone handle and thus made themselves iron knives ? something that no other Eskimo group had , except for rare pieces of drift or trade iron coming from Asia into Alaska . Here then we have both an invention and a loss connected with the same environment ? an apt illustration of how complexly culture operates . 155 . EFFECTS OF ISOLATION : SOUTHAMPTON AND EASTER ISLANDS Small , isolated peoples are especially interesting because of the unexpected things that happen to them . While contacts remain open , complete losses are less likely to occur . Wholly localized increments , and fixations at an ancient level , are also less expectable under open contacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both in and out .  | On Southampton Island , at the entrance to Hudson Bay , lived a second Eskimo group who had lost boats from their culture . They were therefore cut off from intercourse with the world unless other Eskimo , or subsequently whalers , ventured to them . They did have a makeshift substitute for alongshore hunting : inflated sealskins that they paddled , riding them like hobbyhorses . But with only these they could probably secure nothing more than occasional small seals . Their main dependence accordingly was on a large herd of wild reindeer that roamed the two-hundred-mile-wide island . With this herd once eaten up , reduced by disease , or impossible to get at , the Southampton Eskimo were doomed . In fact , this fate overtook them in 1902 , when they starved to death . All in all , their tools were not those of the other eastern Eskimo , but represented a somewhat deteriorated form of what is called the Thule phase of Eskimo culture . This phase is estimated to have flourished quite widely in the American Arctic around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more modern or historical Eskimo culture . It looks therefore as if the Southamptoners , once they had settled down with their simplified and boatless version of the Thule culture , managed to get along and survived for centuries before disaster caught up with them . The Polynesians of Easter Island , though they must originally have come in canoes , were also nearly boatless when discovered , because of lack of logs or planking . They had a very few small canoes , carrying from two to four persons , ingeniously sewed together of many patches and splinters of wood . The island is only ten by thirteen miles in size , is grassy and windswept , and very isolated . It lies sixteen hundred miles from Polynesian Mangareva , twenty-two hundred from South America . Tapa-bark cloth was nearly as scarce as canoes , because the paper mulberry withstands the cool winds of Easter Island only with considerable coddling . Breadfruit and coconuts are wholly prohibited by the climate ; but bananas , sweet potatoes , taro , and yams were grown . All in all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech was a pure Polynesian dialect ? with its richness considerably thinned down by their small numbers and by environmental lacks and limitations . But the culture was thinned down more or less all over , without notable total losses at any one point . There were the usual Polynesian gods , chants , myths , kings or chiefs , wars , human sacrifice and cannibalism , houses , stone platforms , dress , foods , and the rest , in a somewhat meager provincial form . What is really remarkable about this isolated culture is not so much what it had lost as certain unique positive increments that must have been local developments . Three of these stand out . The first was a peculiar bird cult culminating in a ceremonial race that was the great event of the year . The second feature was wooden tablets incised with lines of figures that look remarkably like a script and appear to have had some connection with prayers or chants , but which could not he read , and probably were not true writing but decorative symbols sitnil.tr to large petroglyphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third specialty consisted of gigantic rude statues of tuff rock weighing from four or five to twenty or thirty tons . These statues have partial parallels elsewhere in Polynesia in small stone carvings or fair-sized wooden ones . Consequently they represent a heightening of degree ? the largest statues occurring on one of the smallest islands ? rather than a radically new idea . But the bird cult and the tablets are without real parallels elsewhere in the Pacific and are accordingly indicated as having been devised in the isolation of Easter Island . In this case , therefore , loneliness had several unique and conspicuous results , though they are probably balanced by many minor losses or impoverishments . The period during which Easter Island was occupied is not known , but is estimated to have been less than a thousand years rather than more . Assuming an average population of 3000 , for which there is warrant in the reports of early white voyagers , we must credit this small number of islanders with considerable originality in having evolved their specializations in perhaps from five to eight centuries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as do some of the fantastic theories which blow up the Easter Island situation into extreme improbabilities ? sunken land bridges , vanished prior races , or " writing " mysteriously preserved from the Indus Valley script of five thousand years earlier . 159 . DISPLACEMENTS On the whole , " loss " appears often to consist of a displacement by something new , rather than being an outright disappearance or a mere melting-away . And the displacement is often only partial . Thus we still have candles and oil lamps though gas came in a century ago and electricity in turn has been generally substituted for gas . The older elements survive , though with diminished or specialized scope . The total culture is thereby so much richer than before . Much of the enormous variety of our technology is due to this preservation of the old alongside the development of the new . The established culture trait loses most of its functions but retains part , or even acquires new ones . It is a use that is lost rather than the trait or item itself . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilitarian devices that are dispossessed by new inventions to persist in art , sport , luxury , religion , or symbolism . Thus , in North America the automobile has virtually displaced the horse for transportation of both passengers and goods . Yet the horse is still used considerably in certain situations , such as for small-farm plowing . It holds its own without diminution in racing , horse shows , rodeos , circuses , polo , and as a form of pleasurable exercise . All these serve the ends of sport or play . Similarly the bow still exists in our culture , but archery has become purely a sport . Woodcuts used to be the ordinary method of illustrating hooks ; only expensive works had steel engravings . Photographic reproduction has entirely displaced the woodcut for practical purposes . Even apart from screen plates that  | render light-and-shade values with transitions , the ordinary pen-and-ink drawing , which can be done by the artist in a fifth of the time required for cutting a block , gives the same effect , and if necessary a much finer one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of actually illustrating in print , yes . But it survives , in fact is having a bit of a cult , as an art form , as an aesthetic expression , as a conscious revival of what is antiquated and simple and comfortable and rude , something like eighteenth-century furniture or imitations of primitive utensils . We do not live by utility alone . The horn lantern was used when people were poor and glass was expensive as well as brittle . There was always a cow 's horn available , and in winter there were evenings in which the farmer could steam and pare and trim it . Glass being much clearer , as soon as its price came down through industrial improvements and mass production , it drove horn out ; except that occasionally we still buy sheets of horn for our electric bulbs to shine through with a " natural " mellow amber glow while we talk in the living-room . The glass that was once available only for the wealthy has now become universal ; horn , once the poor man 's refuge , has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization , especially in our own of the past century or two , are really displacements , or even inversions of function , like this . A curious analogy is found in the history of the dog , the almost universal domestic animal . Except where he is of specific value for transport , hunting , herding , or watching , most cultures other than our own may be said to tolerate rather than to protect him ; he fends for himself and becomes a scavenger . There are a few groups of primitive tribes that are exceptional in being dogless . There was at least one of these groups in South America and another in native northern California . In this latter area the dog was by no means unknown , but one might have to travel through several Indian villages to encounter one or two . These had been bought or traded from outside , and they were pampered , fed , allowed in the house at night , named , and given formal burial when they died . They were too soft and valuable to be used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have had no chance , ordinarily , to breed ; so the supply had to be kept up by import from outside . This primitive luxury manifestation strangely parallels contemporary New York , where tens of thousands of childless couples keep a dog in their apartment , and at night have the maid or a husband lead him about a bit to foul the public street . It is the attitude of overcherishing a pet that is common to the two cases . How did these California Indians come to have their attitude ? Evidently it was because they were essentially dogless and knew no practical use for dogs when they did get them . They may have been this way for one of two reasons . Either they had never in their past history acquired a full-scale dog-keeping habit , or they once followed it and it went into disuse ? a case of loss , or more exactly of near-loss displacement into a luxury . The latter seems more likely in view of the near-universality of the dog among American Indians , and the fact that the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been in some contact and communication with the much more numerous dog-keeping tribes ( ? 165 ) . Displacements involving both loss and innovation occur also in situations other than those of attitude or function . With cosmetics there may be substitutions of bodily topography . Many primitives paint the body as well as the face . The ancient Egyptians concentrated on the eyelids , the nineteenth century on the cheeks . Lipstick was unknown . After this had come in , interest shifted to the lips , at first timidly ; but after a time the cheeks were toned or browned in order to exaggerate by contrast the vivid redness of the lips . Painting of the nails also developed ? a new area that primitives seem to have overlooked ; but at least it is a reversion to cosmetics elsewhere than on the face . We tend to think first , in all such cases , of the new or intruding item ; it is what attracts interest ; but of course every innovation ordinarily involves a loss too . The whole cosmetic custom went out once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , though perhaps next time possibly as a change of taste rather than from moral scruple. 160 . KINDS OF LOSS There remains the more general , seemingly philosophical problem of how large a factor cultural loss is or can be . For instance , can the loss be entire for one feature ? Beyond that , could losses be universal , so as to lead to cultural death ? Actually , the questions are ambiguous . First of all , entire loss of features from what ? From the particular culture of a particular people ? In that case , the answer definitely is Yes . For instance , " we " have lost slavery in the past century . That holds for the United States . But does it hold for the totality of human culture , past and present , everywhere ? Such a loss will obviously come more slowly : witness Ethiopia , which is still de-facto slaveholding . And in many cases , even if universal loss had occurred , it might be hard to establish . Things have a way of hanging on long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the subcultures of unsophisticated social strata at home : as astrology , crystal-gazing , voodoo , and magic do among ourselves . Then , as we have just seen , an item of culture may be displaced by a novelty from most of its uses , even from its primary use , but persist in one of its uses , or even acquire a new luxury or play use . Second , it is necessary to narrow the question by defining what it is that is being lost . Is it culture content or culture form ? A specific element , a system , a pattern , or an attitude ? Or indeed do we mean that a whole culture may disappear ? In the sections on progress ( ? 127-128 ) , we have seen that among those civilizations which by common consent are reckoned as higher there has been an indubitable drift to discountenance behavior motivated by magic and animism , as well as that which is psychically infantile and unsocialized in its inhumanity and its crude emphasis on the physiological . We may expect , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gain of reason , taste , and  | humanity at the expense of practices based on more infantile motivations will continue . But we certainly can not prove that it will continue indefinitely , nor can we assert that there might not be conditions which would reverse the trend and cause increase of what is now diminishing . On the basis of a breakdown into more precisely defined questions , some generalizations can be made as to loss . Specific items , such as painting the eyelids , or hammer-hardening copper , are more likely to be lost , by outright giving up or by displacement , in any one culture or in all human culture , and to be lost more rapidly , than broad , varied activities such as fishing or animal husbandry , or than large systems such as a religion or a method of writing . The counterpart is that the small trait generally also gets accepted more readily than a big complex . This is logically obvious ; and the chief significance of the point perhaps is to help us guard against dealing alike with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramified networks . Replacements , modifications , and substitutions are , broadly speaking , more characteristic of the changes of organic evolution ; additive increments are more typical of the changes of human culture ( ? 5 , 127 ) . But this difference is probably most accentuated in artifacts , tools , and technologies , where a whole array of devices serving similar but not quite identical purposes can easily exist side by side with advantage and without conflict ? say tenons , pegs , nails , screws , rivets , lashings , which all hold parts together . Religions , writings , or social systems may also coexist ? witness the three " religions " of China and the two writings of Korea ( ? 221 ) ; but between such there is likely to be strain or conflict , and time is required for an adjustment , if one is worked out at all . And particular items are likely to be rejected or forced out where they are in conflict with a dominant socioreligious system : blood sacrifice in Christianity or Mohammedanism , for instance , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to imagine any socioreligious system so averse in principle to crank handles or screws as to force their abandonment from its culture . The contrast of the organic process as substitutive , of the cultural as additive , is broadly true , but it must not be forced so far as to mean that organic novelties occur only as substitutions ? that is , as accompaniment of losses ? while cultural novelties are regularly incremental . It is true that when birds evolved out of reptiles they gave up a pair of running limbs to acquire a pair of wings , whereas when men learned to fly in airplanes it was not by sacrificing arms ? nor even wagons , railroads , and motorcars . From the point of view of the history of birds themselves it is true enough that they acquired flight by a transformative substitution . But from the angle of the evolution of life as a grand total there was also an increment : running reptiles and flying birds where there had been only running reptiles before . And much the same had happened millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having developed air-breathing and come out of the water , somehow got two pairs of  | wings and soared away as insects . The natural tendency in dealing with animals is to consider what happens to a particular line of descent in its evolution , but in dealing with man to view a cultural change as if it affected the totality of human culture . And not without reason , since an innovation may and sometimes actually does spread to all cultures , whereas the wings developed by birds remain confined to descendants of birds : they can not possibly spread to nondescendants . In short , the contrast of basic process of organic evolution and cultural evolution is valid and fundamental ; only it must not be pushed to exaggeration by comparison of a single line of organic development with the whole breadth of cultural development . Culture also has its substitutions , and therewith its losses ? especially the single or particular culture as viewed separately . 161 . PROBLEM OF THE DEATH OF CULTURES When we come finally to the question of cultural death , it is particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enmeshed in what is really a metaphor . There is presumably no possibility of all human culture " dying " ; that is , disappearing from internal causes . Of course , the cooling of the sun , the loss of our atmosphere , a collision of the earth or its atomic explosion ? any such event that extinguished the human race ? would automatically extinguish all culture with it . But that would not be an inherent or a spontaneous death . It may be assumed that culture has sufficient survival value for our naked , unarmed species so that if any branches of man , for whatever reason , got into the way of somehow consecutively diminishing or destroying their own stock of culture , they would inevitably be eliminated in competition with those branches which advanced or even only maintained theirs . At the opposite end of the scale , as concerns culture traits or items ? customs , techniques , beliefs ? it is obvious that these get changed , replaced , and lost , but that there is no need of applying to these matter-of-fact happenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as " death . " The situation in connection with which the phrase probably arose and has a possible meaning is the passing away of particular national cultures . If there really is a " decline and fall " of civilizations or peoples , there might well also be a " death . " What seems to be actually involved in such cases is the dissolution of a particular assemblage of cultural content , configurated in a more or less unique set of patterns belonging to a nation or a group of nations . Such particular assemblages and constellations do unquestionably " die out " ; that is , they dissolve away , disappear , and are replaced by new ones . The elements of the content of such cultures may have previously spread to other cultures and survive there . Or their place may be taken at home by elements introduced from abroad . Or they may survive , with or without modification , at home , in the different configuration that gradually takes the place of the old one as a successor culture . All  | that goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a particular , characterized , over-all configuration or pattern grouping . Thus there can be no question that the culture of ancient Egypt is " dead " ? though a more precise formulation would be that its specific pattern assemblage has long since ceased to function or exist anywhere . We even know a good deal of the circumstances of the dissolution . Toward 1400 B.C. there was a last great flourishing of the Egyptian patterns . True , there had been a premonitory symptom a few centuries before in the irruption of the Hyksos , the first conquerors of Egypt , even though transient ones . But there had been recovery from this , and on the rebound the greatest military might , expansion , wealth , excellence of art , and development of thought were attained by the Egyptians . The inherent patterns of their culture may be said to have been fully realized or to have been saturated then . After that , with pattern potentialities exhausted , there could be only diminished or devitalized repetition ; unless the patterns can be reformulated in the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recasting the civilization into a new one or into a thoroughly new phase of one . This latter did not happen in Egypt ; so more and more sluggish , mechanical repetition within the realized but fully exhausted patterns became the universal vogue . After about 1200 B.C. , general decline is evident . There were civil wars and rival dynasties , failure of art , and evidently of wealth , with only temporary checks . The last line of fairly successful rulers maintained themselves through Greek and other foreign mercenaries , while foreign ideas seeped in . From 700 B.C. OD , Assyrian , Persian , Macedonian , and Roman conquests succeeded one another , with the upper classes increasingly Hellenized , and finally all classes Christianized . By A.D. 600 the old civilization had disappeared substantially as completely as now . No one worshiped Osiris or the hawk-headed Horus , no one could read hieroglyphs , no one mummified his dead , no one was Pharaoh . The Arab conquest and Islamization beginning a few decades later merely superimposed one more stratum on the cultural layers under which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of " death " may be impossible to specify , just because the process of " dying " went on so long and is so continuously evident . Egyptian culture as a unique nexus and entity thus went out of existence . But the society to which it had been attached went on . The Hellenized Egyptians of Cleopatra 's time , the Hellenized Christian Egyptians of A.D. 500 , the Mohammedan Egyptians of A.D. 1000 , and those of today are no doubt mainly the bodily descendants of those Egyptians who first shaped their distinctive civilization around 3500-3000 B.C. Especially is this true as regards the mass of the population , the rural fellahin . The stream of biological heredity rolled on through the millennia with only minor alterations ; above it , civilizations grew , dissolved , entered , and replaced one another . The components of the old Egyptian civilization did not perish equally . Here and there hits of it persist into the thoroughly different culture aggregate  | of present-day Egyptian culture : perhaps a water-bucket sweep , an ass under his load . Other elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since been abandoned everywhere in the world . Other content traits still exist in one or another of the contemporary living cultures , including our own . If it is difficult to name such , that is only because the expansive phase of Egyptian culture productivity took place so long ago ? it ended more than a thousand years before Western civilization began to germinate ? that transmitted elements have reached us indirectly , at second and third hand , in much altered dress . Original Egyptian traits perhaps first became Asiatic , then Minoan , Greek , finally Roman , before they filtered into incipient Occidental culture , with reselection and remodeling all along the slow , devious route . But elements , ideas , or stimuli of probable Egyptian origin are recognizable in our own calendar , writing , religion ( influences contributory to the concepts of monotheism , dying god , afterlife , Madonna with child ) , architecture , plant and animal husbandry ; and others reappear in modern native African cultures ( ? 311 ) . This picture seems typical of what ultimately happens to cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it diffuses through space and time , in ever new settings and with endless remodelings , selections , and recombinations . The ethnically or nationally individuated pattern aggregates of culture material ? what we ordinarily call civilizations or culture wholes ? also change , though slowly . But beyond a certain point it is no longer a matter of wear and tear with them , of better or worse fortunes , but of either gradual dissolution or gradual ossification of the nexuses which have held them into an active integrated whole . Even before they have become mainly loose pieces or skeleton , another and younger civilization is usually ready to step into their place ; or , if there is none such in the vicinity , a new civilization may slowly integrate out of the debris of its indigenous predecessor . At any rate , such is , in outline , what history tells us of the aging and death of past cultures . The corresponding societies , the culture-carrying groups , have a way of going on ; much of the cultural content continues to exist and function somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of patterned interweavings of content characterizing a civilization that breaks down . The question that inevitably comes to our minds is whether such an end is necessary , or whether our own civilization may perhaps escape it . An honest answer seems to be that available precedent is pretty solidly one-way , but that history is never a sure basis for prophecy , since conditions can never be exactly repeated and precedents are therefore always only partial . For instance , there might be a new influence of culture-planning . Of this we have so far had only rudiments as by-products of contemporary social planning ; for most social planning to date aims essentially to freeze most of the existing cultural values while trying to distribute their benefits more satisfactorily among the members of the society ? or among all societies .  | ' What is of interest in this connection is the contemporary trend of other cultures to assimilate themselves to Occidental civilization , of Turks , Arabs , Indians , Chinese , and Japanese to " Westernize " in their ways of life and standards . Mankind has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet unitary ; but at the moment it is traveling fast that way . A good many persons , as diverse as ardent Christian missionaries , Communists , generalized idealists , until 1945 even Fascists and Nazis , look forward to the universality of civilization ? implicitly their kind of civilization ? as a goal and a boon . But there is this consideration : Suppose we attain a single , essentially uniform , world-wide civilization that has supplanted the many diverse ones of the past . And suppose that in attaining this one civilization we achieve its aims , realize the values potential in its patterns . What then when the exhausted , repetitive stage is reached , and there is no new rival culture to take over responsibility and opportunity and start fresh with new values in a different set of patterns ? what then ? There is no precedent , and no answer , optimistic or pessimistic , can be proved for this future contingency . But the question is worth thinking about .               @ @ @ @ @ @
