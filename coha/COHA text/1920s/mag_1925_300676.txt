A. G. Sorlie , Governor of North Dakota , appointed a Senator to fill the vacancy caused by the death last summer of Edwin F. Ladd . The man appointed is 33-year-old Gerald P. Nye , publisher of the Griggs County Sentinel-Courier of Cooperstown , N. D. , and co-editor with his brother of the North Dakota Non-Partisan , official organ of the Non-Partisan League . Senator Frazier , the other Senator from North Dakota , exclaimed : <P> " Mr. Nye is a Progressive Republican , and he will make a good representative of the state . He proved his worth in North Dakota through his fight in his newspaper and on the public platform in the interest of the farmers and workers . " <P> But the appointment is not so stereotyped as it looks . In 1913 , the 17th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution was adopted , providing for the direct election of Senators by the people and declaring that in case of a vacancy a governor may appoint a senator temporarily if empowered to do so by state law . Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such law . There is a North Dakota law , however , empowering the Governor to make appointments of state officers to fill temporary vacancies . Mr. Nye 's right to a seat in the Senate rests on the contention that a U. S. Senator is a state officer . Is he ? <P> Several weeks ago Senator George Higgins Moses of New Hampshire , Chairman of the Republican Senatorial Committee , told Governor Sorlie that , according to legal advice he had taken , the Governor did not have power to appoint a senator . Apparently the Governor accepted this opinion ; only recently Mr. Sorlie called a special election for next June to fill the vacancy . North Dakota may now have three men filling one Senate post in the course of a single year : Mr. Nye serving from now to June ; a second man elected next June to serve until March , 1927 ; and a third senator elected a year from now to take office for a full term in March , 1927 . <P> But the chances are against it . In the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be disinclined to seat youthful Editor Nye , because he , a non-Partisan Leaguer , will add one more to the number of insurgent Republicans in the Senate .
