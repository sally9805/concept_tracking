txt When congress resumes its sessions tomorrow floods of oratory will consume the time of the House for the next two days . After that the lawmakers will get down to business . The Senate . is expected to resume the effort to break the deadlock over the Chairmanship of the Interstate Commerce Committee . Leaders do not expect to succeed at once , and a plan is under consideration to authorize the committee to act without a Chairman , so that the business of the Senate may be transacted pending settlement of the Chairmanship contest . There will be four set speeches in the House tomorrow  --  by Mr. Treadway of Massachusetts on the anthracite coal situation ; Mr. Upshaw of Georgia on " National Sobriety and the Majesty of the Law " ; Mr. Tucker of Virginia against the Sterling-Towner bill dealing with . a cure for illiteracy , and Philippine Commissioner Guevara on " Freedom for the Islands . " On Friday Mr. Beedy of Maine will speak against recognition of Russia , but in favor of a trade agreement . After the Beedy speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appro7 priation bill for the Interiorg , baniii will be reported and debate 'd .. , , ' , 3kreiV that bill is finished the Navy Department appropriation bill will be taken up . Besides the appropriation bills , there seems to be no set program for the House to follow . The fact that a Republican conference is expected to demand precedence for the soldiers ' bonus bill has thrown arrangements for taking up the Mellon tax reduction . bill into confusion . Republican leaders said today the legislative program was all awry . Democrats Plan Fight on Mellon Bill . Democrats in the House began to map out their campaign against . the Mellon tax bill when , under a call from the minority leader , Mr. Garrett , members of the Ways and Means Committee met with him behind closed doors this afternoon . It was said that the meeting was of a preliminary character and that no concrete understandings were reached . Although some Democratic members of the committee and others outside , that body have ideas of their own on fiscal policy , and have expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences must be composed if there is to be a mass attack on the tax bill . Those who took part in today 's conference were Mr. Garrett and Representatives Crisp of Georgia . Collier of Mississippi , Dickinson of Missouri , Hull of Tennessee and Oldfield of Arkansas . Chairman Green returned to Washington today and made preparations for the Ways and Means Committee going ahead tomorrow with consideration of the administrative sections of the bill . Mr. Green Paid he hoped the committee would sanction a plan whereby explanations would be given out daily of the difficult technical points taken up and discussed in the committee . If this is done it will be a reversal of the secrecy with which the committee proceedings were first conducted . Radical Program Not Ready . The Radicals in the House opposed to the Mellon bill have not yet got to gether on their ideas . Representative Frear of Wisconsin , the tax expert of the Radicals , is to make a speech soon , outlining certain views on tax adjustment ; but this has not yet received the official stamp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their suggestions for reformation of the House rules , which are to be submitted to the Rules Comikittee very soon . When that task is completed they will take up their tax program . At that time Mr. Frear , Mr. Nelson , Mr. LaGuardia of New York , Mr. Woodruff of Michigan and Mr. Keller of Minnesota are ex- pected to have something to put forward . Mr. Nelson has not yet had time to fix all the details he wishes to in the tax plan , he stated this afternoon . There were , however , he assorted . " three necessary feet in the tripod , " these being an excess profits tax , a high enough . surtax scale and an inheritance tax . " We regard the Mellon plan as a camouflage that will continue to pass the burden on , " Mr. Nelson said . " The people know what they want In tax changes . They understood the situation .

I of the house . If a Democrat , proposed an excess profits tax sufficiently high i enough to please the Radicals , they said , they would support it without Introducing . one of their own . A reported compromise , proposed by Representative- Dickinson of Iowa , an outstanding member of the AgriculturalProgressive bloc , to establish a maximum for the surtaxes between 37 and 42 per cent did not make much of a hit with the insurgents , who wanted no lower maximum than 50 . Some members of the Iowa delegation . though strong adherents of the Mellon plan . which proposes a 25 per cent . maximum , said they had not seen any demand in their home newspapers for a reduction below the present figure . They said , as did the Radicals , they believed agricultural interests opposed such a cut .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
