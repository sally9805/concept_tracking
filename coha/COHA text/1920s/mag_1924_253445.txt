Many , many years ago an opera called Cavalleria Rusticana was composed . It proved , as a vaudevillian would say , an immediate wow . Its Intermezzo , written as a time-filler to cover the distribution and consumption of oranges between the acts , has been scored for every known combination of instruments , including flute and banjo , hand-organ , and the voice of John McCormack . <P> The young man in the checked Victorian suit who composed Cavalleria followed it up with many others . Practically every one of these was a comparative flop , Pietro Mascagni remains a one-opera man ( which , after all , is better than a no-opera man , particularly if the one opera is a Cavalleria ) . It is now 22 years since Mascagni visited the U. S. He arrives here next month , together with the score of his new Piccolo Marat , which has been successful at La Scala in Milan and the San Carlo in Naples . There is a chance that a howling success here will make it his " second " opera . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capuzzo , Rino Dldrati , Irma Vigano , Maria Lecer-Casale , Adriana Boccanera , Enrico Nani , Francesco Novelli and Luciana Donaggio , singers . Signers Alfredo Salmaggi and Antonio Ferrara have already arrived as couriers and business managers . <P> They have made arrangements for the composer to conduct six open-air operatic performances in Brooklyn , and a two-weeks ' " season " at the Manhattan Opera House .
