Sly citizens of Paris have chuckled for years , if not centuries , at the classic story of three Frenchmen which concludes , " Ah , lucky Gaston ! " <P> Last week however smart Paris applied the stock expression , " Lucky Gaston ! " in an entirely new and decorous sense to the President of the Republic , M. Gaston Doumergue . <P> Reason : Parliament had just tripled " Lucky Gaston 's " salary , raising the President of France from 600,000 francs to 1,800,000 francs per year ( $70,200 ) . In addition the Presidential allowances for " household expenses " and " travel " were raised to $27,300 and $35,000 . But M. le President must pay an income tax of $31,200 . Thus his net stipend from the state is $101,400 per year .
