I T IS autumn of the year 1803 and all Maryland assembles for the fall races . A buzz of excitement runs through the crowd . Who is this young man , handsome , fashionably attired and of an ingenuous charm , at whom everyone stares ? Commodore Joshua Barney has brought him on from New York , and entertains the young officer at his residence . The crowd , all eyes , sees the guest of Commodore Barney pay small heed to the racing ; his gaze is in one direction and his look is a look of discovery . Whispers run about ; the surmise is easy ; he has caught sight of Elizabeth Patterson . Staid William Patterson , a Baltimore merchant prince at fifty , sits back placidly and a goddess sits beside him . Mr. Patterson , comfortable and kind , and as yet undisturbed by the manifestations of divine right , thinks of her as " my daughter Betsey . " A few days are impatiently passed and then at length the belle of Baltimore attends a gathering at the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There the young officer is introduced to her . He has spent the interval declaring that she is the loveliest creature his eyes have seen . Now he can savor that loveliness in detail . Her head is of pure Grecian contour ; the forehead shapely ; eyes large and dark ; mouth and chin delicate and firm ; shoulders beautifully rounded ; tapering arms . Her complexion is softly blooming and the expression is tender . Some people assert that it is a tenderness which does not belong to her character . Her little tongue puts a sharp edge on words ; from girlhood she has known all the maxims of Rochefoucauld by heart and has plenty of wit of her own . We are all moths to her candle . Perhaps something of this has been mentioned to the youth in the brilliant uniform but if so he has not heard it . He thinks , and rightly , that he is not as ordinary mortals . For he is the younger brother of the First Consul of France , and the eyes of the whole world are riveted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has conquered Italy , defeated Austria and holds a loaded pistol against England 's breast . No , Jerome Bonaparte is not as other men . Besides , he is madly in love . " I I have the honor to introduce Captain Jerome Bonaparte . " Elizabeth smiles . No moth this , but a brilliant butterfly , the most gorgeous she has ever seen ? of the species " Emperor . " . . . They talk together , are constantly meeting and in a few weeks are engaged . Mr. Patterson becomes suddenly less comfortable . Jerome Bonaparte is a  | minor , a marriage without the consent of his legal guardians would be a great risk , and Jerome is entirely dependent on the First Consul . Mr. Patterson sends Betsey to Virginia . But after a short visit the daughter returns to Baltimore ; she and Jerome at once renew their acquaintance ; and on October 19 , 1803 , obtain a license to marry . In a week Mr. Patterson gets a letter warning him that Captain Bonaparte only wants a home until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn your daughter off , and laugh at her credulity . " Nor is this the only hint of difficulty ; plenty of friends warn the father , on good advices , that no favor can be expected from Jerome 's mighty brother . The merchant tries once more to part the young lovers , by using his authority as Elizabeth 's parent , but altogether without success . To everything that can be said , by him or anyone else , Elizabeth has but one answer : " I had rather be the wife of Jerome Bonaparte for an hour than the wife of any other man for life . " So that was that ! And the stars in their courses heard her spirited words . Nothing to be done ! Nothing ? Mr. Patterson , the prudent merchant , thinks otherwise . " Only force or violence can prevent their union , " he confesses , giving a reluctant assent , and sends for lawyers . He executes a marriage contract . Jerome engages , in case of any difficulty , to validate the marriage , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage is annulled Elizabeth is to keep her right to one third of all Jerome has . Mr. Patterson purses his lips over the contract ; it is probably so much waste paper . He visits the clergy , and here he does better . On Christmas Eve , 18o3 , the marriage ceremony is performed by the Right Reverend John Carroll , Bishop of Baltimore , afterward Archbishop , and the first Primate of the Roman Catholic Church in America . The French consul at Baltimore , Jerome Bonaparte 's secretary , the mayor of the city and other impeccable witnesses are present . Elizabeth wears muslin of extremely fine texture , richly embroidered , and underneath her dress but a single garment , so that one gentleman declares : " All the clothes worn by the bride might have been put in my pocket . " She is not yet nineteen and the world is hers . While Jerome and Elizabeth are visiting Washington , Philadelphia , New York , Niagara , William Patterson is writing to the American minister at Paris . He also sends Elizabeth 's brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the minister and the interview is " of an alarming and desponding nature . " Jerome 's brother Napoleon , the First Consul , is incensed . Robert Patterson sees Lucien Bonaparte , who assures him that the Bonaparte family approves the match and that all will come out well . Lucien , by his own recent marriage , is in disfavor with the First Consul . Lucien 's advice is that Jerome become an American citizen . The Bonapartes , he thinks , will allow Jerome twenty thousand dollars a year and two American homes . On April zo , 1804 , the First Consul speaks . The consul general of France in New York is ordered to give Jerome no money . Jerome is ordered back to France . All captains of French vessels are prohibited from receiving on board " the young person to whom the Citizen Jerome has con- netted himself , it being the First Consul 's intention that she shall by no means come into France , and his will that , should she arrive , she be suffered not to land but be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French senate forbids recognition in France of " a pretended marriage that Jerome Bonaparte has contracted in a foreign country during the age of minority without the consent of his mother and without previous publication in the place of his birth . " The First Consul tells his minister , Dacres , who writes it to Jerome : " I will receive Jerome if , leaving in America the young person in question , he shall come hither to associate himself with my fortunes . She shall not put a foot on the territory of France . If he comes alone I shall forgive the error of a moment and the fault of youth . " Jerome is terrified . He knows his brother , and fears him . Besides , if Lucien , who saved the First Consul at the crisis of his life , can be frowned upon what hope is there for a youngster who has done nothing but this single disobedience ? From Paris , Robert Patterson advises that Jerome stay in America as long as possible but , if he sail , that he bring his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning fills the sky . On May 18 , 18o4 , the First Consul declares himself an emperor . What is ' Elizabeth thinking ? Surrendering herself to her hour as Jerome 's wife , she has thought not at all . Six months of festivity and entertainment have passed , in which she has paid small heed to clouds on the horizon . But now she is lifted up and spurred to action . To France ! Wife of a brother of an emperor who is , thus far , without other heirs than his brothers ! A month or more is spent in efforts to embark but without success . Finally , in October , a ship for Cadiz is found at Philadelphia , but is shipwrecked near the mouth of the Delaware River . Those aboard narrowly escape with their lives and Elizabeth 's aunt is horrified to see her eat heartily of roast goose and apple sauce when she should be on her knees thanking God for sparing her life . More festivities in Baltimore . On December 2 , 1804 , Jerome 's brother , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowns himself Emperor NAPOLEON . An imperial court is created . Two brothers of the emperor , Joseph and Louis , are made princes of the empire with the right of succession . Two brothers , Lucien and Jerome , are excluded from the imperial dynasty . One of William Patterson 's own vessels is sailing for Europe . After a quick and prosperous voyage it brings Jerome and Elizabeth to Lisbon , April 2 , 1805 . Elizabeth is with child . A French  | guard is placed around the ship and she is not allowed to land . An ambassador from Napoleon waits upon her and asks what he can do for Miss Patterson . " Tell your master , " she instructs him , " that Madame Bonaparte is ambitious and demands her rights as a member of the imperial family . " Jerome hastens to Paris , carrying a miniature of his wife . He requests an interview , is refused and is told to address his brother by letter . He does so and gets this answer : " I have received your letter of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may not be effaced in my eyes by a sincere repentance . Your marriage is null , both in a religious and legal point of view . I will never acknowledge it . Write to Miss Patterson to return to the United States , and tell her it is not possible to give things another turn . On condition of her return to America I will allow her a pension during her life of sixty thousand francs per year provided she does not take the name of my family , to which she has no right , her marriage having no existence . " And when at last Jerome is admitted to the presence of his brother , Napoleon says : " So , sir , you are the first of the family who has shamefully abandoned his post . It will require many splendid actions to wipe off that stain from your reputation . As to your love affair with your little girl , I pay no regard to it . " After two weeks in the port of Lisbon , Elizabeth sails for Amsterdam , but there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roads between two warships . After eight days the wife of Jerome suspects that her life is in some danger , sails for England and lands at Dover , watched by great crowds , on May 19th . Five days later Napoleon asks Pope Pius VII to annul Jerome 's marriage . A month later the Pope has refused , so the Emperor secures a decree of nullity from his council of state . On July 7 , 1805 , at Camberwell , near London , Elizabeth gives birth to a boy and names him Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte after the husband from whom she thinks herself only temporarily parted . What has become of Jerome ? He has written frequently and tenderly since the separation at Lisbon , but since his interview with the emperor there has been no letter . " I suppose , " Elizabeth writes to her father from England in August , " he finds it impossible to have a letter conveyed . We imagine that Bonaparte is in some measure a prisoner . " The young mother lives quietly in England , going out not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what I think , it is unjust to condemn until we have some certainty greater than at present , and my conduct shall be such as if I had perfect reliance on him . " But in truth Jerome , between  | displeasure and imperial promises , is turning to water . Standing in an antechamber at Madrid and Mont Cenis , cruising before Genoa , his moments of conscience become further and further apart . The miniature remains unclasped . As late as October , six months after the separation , he writes brief and loving notes : " Life is nothing to me without thee and my son . Be tranquil ; thy husband will never abandon thee . " " I have never had the fatal thought of leaving thee . " " If I were not sure of the happiness of rejoining my well-beloved wife , I should cease to live . " But he consents to the state divorce and is rewarded by being made a prince of the empire and admiral of the French navy . In less than two years he will wed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King of Westphalia . Elizabeth , who returns to Baltimore with their son at the close of 1805 , will hear no more from him and will for years speak of him with complete contempt when she speaks of him at all . Two years have elapsed since Elizabeth 's wedding . She is not quite twenty-one . Napoleon , as is his custom , offers terms to the defeated : A pension of $11,000 a year for the mother and child . At first Madame Bonaparte takes not the smallest notice of this offer . A little later Jerome will send a proposal to make her Princess of Smalealden with a pension of $40,000 yearly ; and she will accept the emperor 's $iz , 000 instead . Jerome will be annoyed and Madame Bonaparte will tell the world that she prefers sheltering under the wings of an eagle to being suspended from the bill of a goose . Besides , she knows the pension from Napoleon will be paid . She thinks hard and to some purpose . " I may yet win . If I am to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have plenty of time . I must get money . " Scrimp and save . Live quietly . Rear her child with painstaking . Watch for what will happen . For nearly ten years she adheres to this program , at the cost of every inclination , until her imperious will is matched by a tenacity equally great . At the news of Waterloo she takes the young Jerome and goes to England . From this hour William Patterson will know no more peace about her . In the crash of Napoleonic fortunes it occurs to Elizabeth that her husband may lay claim to some of her careful hoard . By special act of the legislature of Maryland she is divorced from the King of Westphalia . William Patterson begs her to abandon " a wrong course for happiness " in " seeking for admiration in foreign countries , " but her replies are hardly civil . The Duke of Wellington is among her admirers ; when she winters in Paris , Talleyrand praises her wit , Madame de Stael extols her beauty , and Chateaubriand , Sismondi , Humboldt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at court but she declines on the ground that to comply would show ingratitude toward Napoleon , who had pensioned her . The young Jerome is a strikingly handsome  | lad and centers attention almost as greatly as his mother . She thinks : " Perhaps his future is here in Europe . Mine is . His American future is always at his command . " She determines to have him educated abroad . But for thatsince she will use only the income of her money ? more time is necessary . Patience ! Well , she has learned patience . Refreshed by her year , she returns to Baltimore in the summer of 1816 and , except in her book of accounts , there is nothing to record until the summer of 1819 , when we find her in Geneva with her son . In that city she puts her son in school while the Engltsh and Russian nobility make much of her society . John Jacob Astor brings her an invitation to Rome from the Princess Borghese , Napoleon 's and Jerome 's sister , the capricious Pauline Bonaparte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budding of her hopes ? She is not slow to acknowledge the invitation , but her plan is cautious . It is to woman tr spend three months in Rome a little later , leaving Jerome in school at Geneva . Mr. Astor confirms her judgment that nothing can be counted on . The Count de Survilliers , Joseph Bonaparte , oldest of the brothers , now domiciled in Bordentown , New Jersey , offers Madame Bonaparte his Swiss chateau to live in . She thanks him kindly but it is too far out of town and would make her establishment too expensive . She will spend $r , 000 a year on Bo ? the young Jerome 's pet name ? because she must ; as for herself , a boarding house ; and $3,000 must cover everything . It is November , 1811 , and Elizabeth is in Rome . She has interrupted Bo 's schooling to take him with her . He is sixteen years old , stands five feet seven , and resembles his uncle the emperor . His grandmother , Letizia Bonaparte , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother affectionately . There are gifts , including a tiny pension for Bo from Pauline until he marries . Both his grandmother and Pauline propose that he marry Charlotte , one of Joseph Bonaparte 's daughters . And immediately Elizabeth is fired with the ambition for this match . She spends a year meditating its advantages and communicating them in her letters to her father , whose expression as he reads her views we are perhaps as well for not witnessing . Characteristically , she decides that Joseph Bonaparte should settle $1oo,000 on his girl , to be Bo 's if he outlives her . Mr. Patterson , whom she invariably addresses as " Dear Sir , " must attend to the point . Early in 1811 she sends Bo back to America to win the cause in his charming person . After his departure Elizabeth visits Florence and encounters her husband for the first time in seventeen years . They meet in the gallery of the Pitti Palace . On seeing her Jerome starts and whispers to his queen : " That is my American wife . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thence to Paris . A year earlier she had kept silence over the death of an eagle ; it is too much to expect her to comment on the continued existence of a goose . She does , indeed , refer to her husband only to observe his happy bankruptcy , which is perennial and complete . On the other hand , his attitude toward her is not unfriendly , and toward his first-born , her son , constantly cordial . Like the grandmother and the others , he writes to Joseph to urge that the match be- tween Bo and Charlotte be consummated . Bo is delighted to be back in America , but the young lady to whom he is consigned , being not yet himself quite seventeen ? what does he find ? A dwarf , excessively ugly . ' And after Mr. Patterson has perhaps explained the $ioo , 000 to the poor girl 's father there is little to be said , except by way of explanation to Elizabeth , to whom to explain is always superhumanly difficult . Elizabeth is ready : " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in that family . " She relinquishes the project only by degrees , and settles more firmly than ever her determination that Bo shall marry well . To understand her we must realize that she considers his rank as innate as her son 's fine looks or amiable character . He is unique in America and she considers that he ought not to marry an American girl , however lovely , not even though she had a million . Meanwhile , since there is nothing she can do but to mark time , she will stay in Europe , where her own rank has its advantages and where the possible future lies . Bo , under a tutor , prepares for Harvard . Madame Bonaparte 's second stay abroad has stretched to five years . Now she comes back to America for a year , to see and be with Bo . Except for him , she has a dull time and the summer of 1815 sees her abroad again . She is hardly away before Bc writes to Grandfather Patterson on the general subject of marriage . Mr. Patterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bo , after another European visit and a long stay with his father in Rome , will marry a Baltimore girl and subside into a comfortable and useful American existence . His mother is not present at his marriage , which very nearly severs relations between Elizabeth and William Patterson . But in truth the harassed old merchant is not to blame , as the mother finally recognizes . Now at last she will spend all her income ; what use to scrimp and save ? She does not know that the habit is ingrained . At any rate , Elizabeth thinks , she will remain in Europe ; America holds nothing for her any longer . But after nine years of absence her investments require looking after in times approaching the crisis of 1837 . She returns to Baltimore and will scarcely leave it during the rest of her lifetime . In 1835 , when William Patterson dies , leaving a will that gives her some houses and that utters a few poignant words on her ideas , Madame Bonaparte is fifty and still so beautiful that even one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loveliest creature he has ever seen . In her thirties and forties she had complained of wretched health as well as of miserably low spirits . The ill health is gone forever , without having aged her in the least ; as to her spirits , if they are never to be as high as sometimes they were , neither will they sink so low . The delicate coloring is still the marvel of her complexion , and the three studies of her head , painted by Gilbert Stuart when she was a bride of nineteen , are her truest likeness now , over thirty years afterward.  | In black velvet , cut low , wearing a necklace of diamonds , Madame Bonaparte shows herself occasionally at an evening party or at the opera . Her beauty and wit are as incomparable as ever . " If she were a queen how gracefully she would have reigned ! " had been Talleyrand 's exclamation . One day Marshal Bertrand , Napoleon 's intimate in the exile of St. Helena , comes to see Madame Bonaparte and tells her that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret at the shadow he had cast on her life . Napoleon had been told how high Elizabeth placed his genius and had exclaimed : " Those whom I have wronged have forgiven me ; those I loaded with kindness have forsaken me . " She lives on . When she is sixtyfour she foresees the Second Empire , which duly materializes two years later . When she is seventy she sees her son refuse the title of duke on the terms offered by Napoleon III . When she is seventy-five her husband dies and she and Jerome fight in the French courts for a share of the estate and lose . It is now 186o ; Elizabeth must live through the American Civil War and see how that comes out . It is 1873 , and she is eighty-eight , but a money panic is on , she has investments to look after and this is no time to be taking leave of existence . The black bonnet with the orange feather and the red umbrella may still sometimes be seen on the streets of Baltimore . Her son has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerome , while he is in the French army , she gives large sums . " I wish him to appear in a manner befitting his birth , as the grandson of a king . " For now she has money . " Once I had everything but money ; now I have nothing but motley . " At sixtyfour her income had been $1o,000 a year . At ninetyfour she is worth $1,5oo,000 with an annual income of $1oo,000 , out of which she spends about $Z , 000 . And at ninety-four , willing everything to her two grandsons , tired of the brandy and milk she has lived on these last two years , and having seen the whole of the vast Napoleonic drama from start to finish , she ceases breathing . Her victory has it not been complete ? He who had been her hardest foe , the emperor , wished above all to perpetuate his name . But his son , the King of Rome , is dead these forty years ; the Prince Imperial , son of Napoleon III , perishes in the Zulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonaparte continued . Only through her may the ghost of the proud emperor see his name borne by living men into the twentieth century . Elizabeth has indeed given herself an incomparable revenge the revenge of a woman who loves her conqueror .  |
