A Vital , Beloved and Incomparable Mystery <P> It is one of the tragedies of the art of acting that when the last cur tain falls there is nothing to hold the expression of a great personality for future generations . Sarah Bern hardt is gone , and those who do not hold the impress of her dynamic genius on the tables of reminiscence can know her only as a cloudy legend , obscured by time and by the many puzzles presented by her career .

Bernhardt was almost fanatically patriotic , and engaged extensively in war work both in the War of 1870 and the World War .

Another is of a coffin lined with faded letters , rose-petals and other symbols of her reminiscence , in which she slept from time to time .

Through it all is felt the sharp im pact of a great and noble spirit , a supreme artist and a magnificent woman .
