The story has been told of a young school teacher who stayed up all night at his class reunion , talking . At dawn he shook hands with his comrade , Charles Mclvor , and they pledged themselves to lead the South out of the " bondage of ignorance . " The young school teacher was <P> Edwin Anderson Alderman of the University of North Carolina . <P> That was before 1890 . The South was more than 36% illiterate . Today the South is less than 5% illiterate . Hookworm is no more . Industry is doing well - booming , if you ask the people of North Carolina . Schools are many and clean and well-manned . Universities are larger and prouder . <P> Of course , Edwin Anderson Alderman did not do all these things . But he took the stump , and his voice was sonorous . He asked for higher taxes and hence better schools . He got them , hissed though he was at first . Rockefeller and Rosenwald money began to go to work in the South . . . . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South . " <P> There is little originality in the writings and speeches of Dr. Alderman . It is in fervor and organizing ability that he excels . As president of the University of North Carolina ( 1896-1900 ) , he not only whipped it up to New England standards but also reorganized around it the public schools of the state . Then he became president of Tulane University ( New Orleans ) and in 1904 went to the University of Virginia to be president , an office he still holds . <P> His regime has been successful , partly because he blended efficiency with tradition : it would have been dangerous to apply rigid card-index methods to the University of Virginia , where Southern bloods are wont to loll on the lawn and contemplate the architectural works of Founder Thomas Jefferson . <P> President Alderman has gained the confidence of the alumni , some of whom regarded him as a suspicious crusader in the early years . One graduate , a potent Manhattan banker , has been in the habit of returning to the Virginia campus several times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonorous and friendly President Alderman . Perhaps it was this banker who last week gave , anonymously , $5,000,000 to the University of Virginia . Half of the income from this fund will be used for scholarships and fellowships.
