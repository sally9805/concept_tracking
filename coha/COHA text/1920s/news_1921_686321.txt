txt THE " RHINE PROTEST " MEETING . Some Opinions on Monday Night 's Happenings Inside and Outside Madison Square Garden . To the Editor of The New York Times : At the mass meeting held in Madison Square Garden last night the Right Rev. Patrick James Grattan Mythew is reported to have said : " This is a significant , meeting . Do you realize , those of you- who ' are of German extraction , that if we who are of Irish . extraction and you will come together in this land ( loud applause ) , as we have a right to do , we are in the majority here and we should act as the majority should act , that we would quickly banish into the mists from whence it came this phantom of AngloSaxonism ? It does not exist . " ? What say the . American people as a whole to this clarion cry so openly uttered ? Are they willing to intrust the destinies of our beloved land to the mob assembled last night , which lost no opportunity ' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President of the United States ; - whose speakers denied that German outrages had been committed during the great World War , and , when some loyal veterans shouted " Remember the Lusitania , " Remember Edith Cavell , " cries of " Lynch him , lynch him , " . rang throughout the audience , and these interrupters were forced to leave the hall bscorted by a body of police to save them from the fury of the newly amalgamated na-tionalities ? Referring to the police authorities , does it not seem strange that their endeavors to prevent disturbance and interruptions at the meetings lately addressed by Sir Philip Gibbs and Major Putnam were so much inferior to the mighty efforts put forth last night in order to give the German and Shin Fein orators every opportunity to air their eloquence in denouncing our late allies , and openly advocating a political alliance of their now separate forces , so that together they would be enabled to control the future of our country ? It is quite apparent now that our politicians in pandering to these . different elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind . Is it not about time to wake up and endeavor to realize the danger that surrounds us before the harvest may become a whirlwind ? R. B. HAMILTON . New York , March 1 , 1021 . New York or Berlin ? To the Editor of The New York Times : Last night those of us who witnessed the affair at the Garden wondered whether We were in New . York City or Berlin . In the overflow meeting several hyphenated Americans could be hears to shout , " To hell with ' America ! " " To hell with Wilson and . Harding ! " &c.; Then we heard some one speak wh &; was introduced by the name of Kelly . He told the overflow meeting that he was formerly commanding officer of a battalion of colored troops of the 314th Infantry while overseas . Then lie proceeded to tell the German crowd present how little he thought of his own men . Then we saw some of Enright 's gentlemen club and knock out a young 19-year-old ex-French soldier who had lost an arm . at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present called a lot of bums by some whiskered speaker whose Americanism was very doubtful . And when the same Legion boys stood , . with bared heads , singing " The StarSpangled Banner , " a crowd of police , in charge of a Captain , swooped down on them and cracked heads right and left . Somehow , as stood there on my wooden leg . and thought of the two years I spent in ten army hospital , and of - what I had gone through , I wondered whether it was all worth while ? that my sacrifice was somehow overshadowed by a Mayor who permits such conditions to exist . If these pro-Germans and pro-Irish ( and they were both there last night ) are going to be permitted to vent their spleen upon everything American . then God help the U. S. A. ! J. E. A. New York , March 1 , 1921. 2 and 2 MAke 5 . To the Editor of The New Yorlc Times : All real Americans , some of whom still believe in the possible ? regeneration of the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scenes that took place yesterday in New York , the metropolis of America . - As Ambassador Jusserand so justly remarked , a few days ago , if you keep on hammering into the brains of the people that 2 and 2 make 5 , finally this statement will- become an . axiom , and for many people 2 and 2 will make:5 . This is what the Germans are trYing.to do as regards that fairy tale " The Horrors on the Rhine , " which originated in the Bureau of Propaganda in Berlin ; : this is why , for several months , by means of pamphlets , in the . newspapers , in public meetings " The Horrors ' on the Rhine " are constantly and untiringly brought before . thepeople ; this is why yesterday the von Machs , the Stiefels , &c.,; inside of Madison Square Garden , and dozens of German propagandists ( mostly women ) outside the Garden , repeated the same story over and over again , so that finally for many people . " The Horrors on the Rhine , " although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin , will become an accomplished fact . That France , our ally of 177G and our ally of 1917 , should be allowed : to - be so shamefully treated , to be openly hooted , insulted and slandered by Germans and their sympathizers under the benevolent eye of the police of this city , will be a lasting shame for New , Yprk . The same is the case as far as the sneering and insulting of the President of the United States by a mob of enemy aliens and their friends is concerned . Whatever our party standing may be , we all are Americans first , and we should not forget one instant that until March " 4 Woodrow . Wilson is the Chief Magistrate of our country . No Germans were arrested , although every act of theirs was a breach of the law. ; but four American Legion menivere arrested ' by the police , and among them my son Jacques Rueff , an ex-volunteer in the United States Army and a Lieu. : tenant in the United States Artillery Reserve , their only crime being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States in face of the dishonorable and unlawful acts of the Germans and their Irish sympathizers . CLEMENT RUEFF . New York  --  March 1 , 1921 . From a Disabled Veteran . To those few-remaining patriots in this city , the accounts of the German MeetL ? ing last night must come as a saddening but very enlightening bit of news . What has come over this country , including the men who fought ' ( as they thought ) for it , when our enemies can rise up and defy . us right in our public . square ? Aided- and abetted by the Police ; the boche has launched another attack . Are there no men here any more , much less on the pollee force ? Two . or three years ago , . a blustering cop.would be hailed a hero if he rapped his nightstick upon the head of any one daring to speak in a pro-German manner . Now it is the heads of the exsoldiers he raps ! Where ' was the valiant Lieut . Col. A. E. Anderson , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never saw . any German atrocities ? I ' ought through the war with the Second Division , which incidentally suffered more casualties from boche ' fire than any other in the entire army , and saw them , ' as did my comrades who were there . And they were not Lieutenant Colonels either ! It is ' significant that neither Father Duffy nor the real fighters of the " old 69th " were patting little Jerry on the back last night ! I saw how the Germans squealed like trapped rats , begging for mercy when they faced the steel of American bayonets , I saw their work at Bois de Belleau , Soissons , St. Mihiel and the Argonne , and know what they do when they are on the winning side . All America , including some of these political officeseekers who are patting the Germans on the back now , were screaming about ! ' the Lusitania " and " stricken Belgium . " Where are they now ? It is useless to expect Hylan or any of his ilk to stop this sort of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , but the duty of the American press is to speak for the American people . Place the story of last night 's affair , defended by our blue-coated bullies , beside the casualty lists of three years ago , made up of khaki-clad lads and see how , it looks . What do the thousands of , disabled men still In the army hospitals think of a country and a city which will stand for this , with the cheers ( little good these did ) of the same people hardly died down ? Unless . this " Sort of thing , this cringing of the boche , who showed no mercy when he was the winner , who perpetrated the most awful sort of atrocities , is stopped , we few remaining Americans with the spirit and ideals which made us suffer for months in hospitals will begin to believe that we were wrong , that our pain and the death of our lads was for nothing save the benefit of the munition workers and politicians .
