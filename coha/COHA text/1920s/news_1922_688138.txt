txt The removal of Commander Evangeline Booth as the head of the Salvation Army in America was announced to her yesterday in a radiogram received from her brother in London , General Bramwell Booth , supreme head of the Salvation Army organizations throughout the world . Miss Booth told a NEW YORK TIMES reporter that this was the first official intimation from her brother . that her work was soon to end here . No reason far deposing her was given , and she said she knew of none . Commander Booth said : " I shall obey the order , when the date is set for me to go . I have cabled to Chief Commander Booth for further information . " Apparently laboring under considerable agitation and pained surprise , Miss Booth returned to a conference at which she ' had presided and announced to her chief officials : " An order has come to rue to prepare for my final farewell to you , to the organization and to America , whose people have been so good to me , giving me aid and encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to the work . " Removal Date Not Set . This was the message received by Commander Booth : " The farewell of Commander Evangeline Booth from the U. S. A. has been under . consideration for a number of years , and in the ordinary course Would have . taken place some years back . The war , however , made the change , as it did others , impossible . No date has yet been fixed for the Commander 's farewell , nor has any arrangement been made for a successor as head of the business corporation . We shall in the latter be guided largely by the Commander 's recommendation . " It is not General Booth 's intention to redistrict the United States The present three commands will remain : Should the future extension of our work in the vast areas of the United States make it necessary ; other commands will no ( IOW be created . The three commissioners will be responsible direct to the General in the same way as Commander Evan , geline Booth has hitherto been , and as are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a statement as to why her brother had not previously communicated direct with her regarding so important a change in the American organization , Commander Booth said she did not want to raise any controversy to mar the end of her work in the United States . " The only previous intimation of this kind from General Booth came . two.years ago , when he said to me : ' You can not expect to remain at the head of the , organization all the rest of your life . ' Then , as now , no date was fixed for a change . I have n't lost my spirit of yes- terday or my spirit of willingness to obey as a good soldier . I think I can say I am a Christian first and a. soldier second . " I have always felt that America claimed my best , and , ungrudgingly , I gave my best . The one and only regret is that I had not a better best to give . " Two years ago Commander Booth designated for appointment the three commissioners mentioned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These commissioners and their districts are : Thomas Estill of New York , Eastern district : William Peart , with headquarters in Chicago , for the central district ' , and Adam Gifford , in San Francisco , Western district . These officers , with Colonels W. F. Jenkins and Gustave Reinhardsen , national secretaries , were the members at Miss Booth 's conference of matters relating to the organization . Recently General Booth ordered a cut in the salaries of the organization 's 4,000 officers lit 1,100 American cities , which was objeaed to by Commander Booth . She said the pay was even then too small . Whether this caused any friction between the supreme . head and the Commander here could not bn learned , but it is not believed to have had any important hearing on the ' decision to remove Miss Booth . This cut meant only a reduction of $1 a week in the pay of married officers and $2 for single persons . No Qualified Successor . " There is no person here or abroad who is known to possess the qualifications as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the organization . She has made the organization what it is now in America . She has won the confidence and the love of the people ? through her hard work , and every door has been open to her , from that of the White House to the most humble abode and the way to the suffering and unfortunate in dark places . " Others recalled that the Salvation Army , during its crisis resulting from the withdrawal of Mr. and Mrs. Ballington Booth and the establishment of the Volunteers of America , had been " saved " and made to prosper spiritually and materially , by Commander Booth . . If Bile goes , and the affairs here are to be directed exclusively by a non-resident commander , a large part of its national influence will be lost and much of its support be withdrawn and given to the Volunteers of America , it was predicted . Here are two things accomplished by Commander Booth , one having to do with the religious work and the other with Its finances and material investments : Property values and investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the training schools yearly of 500 or more cadets for the religious work . which at the beginning of her administration reached not more than seventy pupils yearly . Miss Booth , who had been in the International Training School In London and later active , in the work in Canada , came here first in 1896 to take charge of the organization following the death of the American head , Mrs. Booth Tucker , who was killed in a railway accident in Kansas . Miss Booth returned after three months ' work , to resume her organization work in Canada . She was placed in command here when the Ballhigton Booths withdraw in 1904 . At that time Miss Booth applied for and afterward received citizenship papers . As an American this enabled her to aet as the President of all the incorporated ? parts of the individual organizations of the Salvation Army in the several States and of the general incorporated organiAtion here . But it was the marked personality of Miss Booth and her knowledge of the work to which she gave her life t'l , pt won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . In her recent tour of the West , when she spoke of the work of the Salvation Army at Portland . Seattle , Los Angeles an ? San Francisco , she drew audiences of more than thirty thousand persons .
