txt // and women . It must recognize a duty to uphold such ideals as will make the individual a better citizen and member of society . It must feel the influence of popular taste and judgment , and yield in greater or less measure . to the sway of the popular will . Even poetry must become to some extent " popular , " and must recognize the right of the people to find poetic expression for the spiritual and the ideal that is within common breasts . Literature is likely to return from the study of nature to the study of man . Romance will still exist , for the common people are always romantic ; but it will tend to be such romance as common people can understand . On the other hand , there will be encouragement to realism , for men will desire to see the portrayal and to be told the meaning of ordinary life . To some sensitive souls , this democratization of literature will scene a lamentable and a vulgar thing ; but democracy will be likely to have faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impelled by its own genius . Nor will those who know the history of English literature find that faith unjustified by the past . They will recall that there have been fears before lest literary genius should be degraded by stooping to common themes ? lest King Cophetua should lower his dignity by stepping down to wed the beggar maid . Then they will remember ? and the remembrance will be sufficient ? that Robert Burns taught William Wordsworth How Verse may build a princely throne On humble truth . It is not too much even to believe that the literature of democracy may eventually become the greatest of all literature , because more than any other it is the . literature of humanity . The conditions of democracy , whose natural influence upon literature we have thus tried briefly to indicate , // prevailed throughout the period whose literary history we are now to consider . If those conditions did not produce in the fullest measure the effects suggested , the reasons are to be sought in two directions . In the first place , the conditions themselves were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth was slow , and its perfect results were in some degree hindered by the coexistence of aristocratic and monarchical institutions . Democracy in America was more thoroughgoing , and its effects on literature have been consequently more typical . In the second place , the influence of democracy has been to a large extent modified by the simultaneous action of another great and powerful force ? that of modern science . Nevertheless , in spite of all necessary limitations , the literary influence of democratic ideas and of democratic conditions of life may be discerned with sufficient clearness and fulness to justify the recognition of democracy as one of the great guiding impulses of the literature of the age . The wonderful growth of the novel in its manifold forms offers large illustration of the presentation of life and character as they exist in a democratic state of society . Miscellaneous prose has dealt largely with the themes and problems suggested by a democratic age , and not the less so when the writers have been hostile or critical in their attitude toward democratic theories and aspirations . Even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and the sentiments of a democratic society have had their influence and have found their expression . Another controlling influence in the age , as we have already intimated , has been that of Science . The growth of natural science has been one of the great facts of the nineteenth century . It has exerted Natural a profound influence upon human thought in all its departments ? religious , philosophical , political , social , historical , educational , literary , as well as purely scientific . // It has had a far-reaching and almost incalculable effect likewise upon the conditions of practical life . Within two generations , the world has been almost revolutionized in the matters of commerce , trade , travel , intercommunication , and every-day living . The facts in the case are too clear and too familiar to be in need of specific illustration . Under such conditions , it could hardly be otherwise than that science should have had a profound influence upon literature . This influence has been partly direct and partly indirect , partly negative and partly positive . Science has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening up new realms to the imagination , by increasing the range of imagery and illustration , by giving new conceptions of the universe and of man , by emphasizing the reign of allembracing and unalterable law , by teaching new methods of analysis and research , by laying stress upon the idea of organic growth , by stimulating anew man 's deep-seated passion for truth and reality . Its most immediate influence has been upon such writings as those of Darwin and Huxley and Tyndall and Spencer ? writings scientific in subject and purpose , yet possessed of no small degree of literary quality . Scarcely less immediate has been its influence upon realistic fiction . The close and accurate study of real life , the analysis of character and motive , the insistence upon the inexorable laws of human being , the conception of evolutionary growth , are but some of the ways in which the novelists have manifested the scientific spirit . Much of this will be found in Thackeray , still more in George Eliot . How far these and like influences are manifested iii other great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The indirect influence of science upon literature has been quite as powerful and important . Science , as we // have implied , has affected all classes , from the highest to the lowest . The improvement in the conditions of living , the increase of prosperity , the advance f in material ciyilizatir ; the mastery over the resources of nature , the growth of industrialism and cornmercialism , the freedom of intercourse among civilized nations , the revelation as to natural law , the impetus top ilosophical thinking , the transformation of method in nearly all departments of research , the disturbance of religious faith and opinion , the change of attitude toward all the great problems of existence all these have affected literature no less profoundly because their influence was indirect . Literature , as we have already pointed out , never expresses the life of an age completely . Least of all could it do so in an age like this , so many of whose ideas and ideals were anything but literary Nevertheless , literature has been . one product of the life in which these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indirectly the influence of the scientific impulse . In no single direction has this indirect influence of science been more strongly felt than in the direction of its effect on religious thought . Carlyle , for instance , feels the scientific impulse more than he knows but is chiefly moved by it in an indirect way to the insistence upon the reality of spirit behind the material garment . On the great poets , also , the scientific influence has been chiefly indirect and mainly through the same religious channel . They have for the most part accepted the conclusions of science with loyal devotion to truth ; but they have not found in science much direct poetic inspiration . Science has affected them rather by affecting their attitude toward great spiritual questions of religion and of life . No poem of the age is more typical than Tennyson 's In Memoriam . It reveals the struggle of a great soul with the doubts and fears which science has induced , the // vindication of " the larger hope " against an aggressive materialism . The struggle of Arnold is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathes through Dover Beach , a sad assurance of powers that make for righteousness through such poems as Palladium and Rug-by Chapel . Morris seems to himself but " the idle singer of an empty day : " Swinburne finds consolation only in the fact That no life lives forever ; That ( lead men rise up never ; That even the weariest river Winds somewhere safe to sea . To him the end of all things is Only the sleep eternal In an eternal night . Only one voice of assured faith and optimism has rung clear like a trumpet across all this tumult . Robert Browning ? looking science fearlessly in the face , accepting without a murmur or a protest all that she has proved , hiding his head in the sands of no blindly orthodox creed ? is yet confidently certain that God 's in his heaven ? All 's right with the world ! The influence of science on literature has been both positive and negative . On the positive side , many men have accepted its conclusions , have availed themselves of its stimulus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence on religious faith , on spiritual conceptions , and on all the other great problems of life and thought . Others have been thrown into an attitude of opposition and revolt , and have either challenged the new movement in hopeless conflict or have sought relief from its oppressive weight in sad resignation or in the old escape from the trouble of the world into the // serene realm of the romantic imagination . To some such and to many men of science , it has seemed that science is necessarily hostile to poetry . Probably in one sense it is ; for by extending the field of definite knowledge , it tends to limit the realm of mystery which is the true domain of the poet . Yet thus far , science has suggested more mysteries than it has solved . When science has done its perfect work , poetry may be swallowed up in knowledge , as faith will be lost in sight . When knowledge is so complete that there is no more room for the exercise of imagination , then it will be time to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , we may think of scientist and poet as complementary to each other , and may content ourselves with the saying of Wordsworth that " poetry is the impassioned expression which is in the countenance of all science . " Such brief allusion is , of course , utterly inadequate to do anything more than barely suggest the influence of democracy and science upon literature during the Victorian Period . Our further discussion must show the application of these general statements to particular cases . In the meantime , two things at least are clear . One is that science has not in our time proved destructive of literature . The other is that the earlier materialistic tendencies of science have not silenced in our poets that instinctive belief in spiritual verities which even science itself is coming more and more to justify . As we turn to a consideration of the literary work of the age , nothing is more striking than its wonderful variety and complexity . The two great forces of Democracy and Science , working sometimes in harmony and sometimes in conflict , operating directly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary situation more than usually confusing . It is impracticable to divide the age chronologically , for the work of many of its greatest men runs // clear through the whole period . The best solution of the difficulty seems to be a division of the literature into miscellaneous prose , the novel , and poetry , and a consideration of each of these branches of literary work in a separate chapter . MACAULAY 'S HOUSE IN LONDON CHAPTER XV THE AGE OF TENNYSON ? PROSE ( 1832-1892 ) THOMAS BABINGTON MACAULAY was one of those rare men who , in the phrase of De Quincey , drew in the lottery of life the double prize of a fine intellect and a healthy stomach . He was , on the one side , a fine animal , and on the other , a man of brilliant political and literary genius . The note of his character was the note of buoyant and cheerful optimism . The world in which he lived seemed to him a good world , and he had a confident faith in human progress and in the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the temper of the revolutionist ; yet he saw with clear vision some of the more striking evils of his day and set about righting them . He had still less of the temper of the visionary and the idealist . He dreamed no divine dreams which were impossible of realization in a practical world . He voiced no passionate cry of human longing or aspiration . A temper like Shelley 's , for instance , could probably have awakened in him neither sympathy nor understanding . His nature was eminently practical . What he saw was the plain fact of life in the clear light of every day . What he sought was such betterment in the conditions of life as were within the scope of reason and possibility . Such a man seemed born to grapple with the actual realities of the world rather than to lead men in the path of infinite spiritual development . The world needs all sorts of leaders , and could no more do without itsMacaulays than without its Shelleys . Indeed , the former are the more absolute necessity . Man must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must first live by bread , in order that he may come to know that he " shall not live by bread alone . " Macaulay spoke to the great masses of men . He spoke to move them to practical action or to definite comprehension . He accomplished his task ; and we may well be thankful for what he did and look to other men for the great spiritual message . It would seem as though just such men as he were necessary in a democratic state of society , and perhaps the natural product of democratic conditions . Macaulay , at any rate , served well his day and generation . He had grown up in an age when individualism was growing in the minds and hearts of men , he came into public life at the time when conditions were ripe for practical democratic action , and he took his effective part with other great leaders of the age in bringing about the beginnings of democratic development . In order to see this practical relation of the man to his age , it will be desirable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life before turning to the consideration of his literary work . Macaulay 's father was a prominent member of the Society for the Abolition of Slavery , and edited an Macaulay 's abolitionist newspaper . We may fancy from Life this fact the sort of political school in which Macaulay grew up . His university training was received at Trinity College , Cambridge . He became a fine classical and historical scholar , obtained a considerable reputation as an orator and debater , and twice won the Chancellor 's medal for English verse . His earlier literary work gave evidence of a deliberate purpose to broaden his mind , to increase his knowledge , and to train himself as a writer . At twenty-five , he made his first important bid for literary fame by his Essay on Milton , a most brilliant piece of work . His literary efforts soon brought him into notice ; and five years later , at the age of thirty , he was in the House of Commons . In the debates leading // superior to other men . The business of government in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able and righteous man and to put him in the place of power . The business of the great mass of men was to obey and to follow such heaven-sent leaders ? not to rule themselves . This was individualism in an extreme form ; but it certainly was not the spirit of democracy . It was the recognition of great character , wherever found ; A but it was by no means the democratic assump tion that all men are equal or that the voice of the people is the voice of God . Coming upon a democratic age , Carlyle found himself in harmony with it so far as it insisted upon the recognition of individual worth , on freedom from tyranny and oppression , on equal opportunity for all men according to their powers ; beyond , this , his attitude was one of criticism and of protest . The world that seemed to Macaulay about the best of all possible worlds seemed to Carlyle about the worst . He wanted men to think of obedience and of duty rather than of freedom and equality . The effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying him along with it , it made him a great critic and censor of contemporary life . His influence was in one sense depressing and discouraging ; but in another , it was wholesome and uplifting . He helped to keep men from forgetting some things which they seemed likely to ignore . He taught them that freedom and equality are not all of life , but that love , work , and obedience have also their place . In a way , therefore , his genius felt the influence of the age , though in some respects he was driven to reaction rather than to advance or to sympathy . Carlyle 's relation to science was somewhat similar . He was in sympathy with the scientific doctrine of law as against the democratic doctrine of liberty . No man was more eager than he to preach the necessity of recogniz344 DEMOCRACY AND SCIENCE ( 1832-1892 ) ing and obeying law . He was in sympathy with science , likewise , in its inflexible devotion to truth and reality . No man was a more intense lover of truth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sham and pretense and unreality . The one feature of the scientific movement that most aroused Carlyle 's antagonism was its tendency toward materialism . There is no doubt that Carlyle ? like many other men of the age ? was profoundly disturbed in his religious beliefs . How far this was the direct result of science may be questioned ; but it was the result of the general unrest and unfaith which science tended to induce . In spite , however , of all religious disturbance in his soul , Carlyle clung to the profound conviction that this is essentially a world of spirit ? that materialism would make it a " dog-kennel " of a world , instead of an antechamber to heaven . Feeling that the tendency of science was materialistic , his conscious attitude toward it was one of hostility . He was affected by it more than he knew , he was in sympathy with it at its best more than he realized ; but he felt called upon to oppose many of its pretensions and to preach the doctrine of the spirituality of existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age . He became also a great prophet ? crying , as it seemed to him , in a spiritual wilderness . Carlyle was a great literary genius , a strong , original , philosophical thinker ; but more than all else , he was a great preacher ? a preacher of duty and labor and obedience , a preacher of spiritual faith and practical righteousness . He was of his age , and felt the great impulses that were moving its life and thought , even though his character and convictions led him to cry out against it with all the strength of his prophetic soul and of his splendid genius . There is comparatively little in Carlyle 's life that calls for particular mention . He was born at Ecclefechan in // the Scotch Lowlands , of a sturdy and God-fearing peasant stock . Educated at the grammar-school of Annan and afterward at the University of Edinburgh , he was at first destined for the ministry , but deliberately forsook that calling for the walks of literature . Against terrible odds of poverty , loneliness , dyspepsia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard battle . For six years , after his marriage with Jane Welsh , he lived and toiled at the lonely farmhouse of Craigenputtoch , slowly building up his literary fame . His studies in German literature and philosophy were coloring his thought and affording material for his pen . He was putting his deep life experience into Sartor Resartus . In 1834 he removed to London , where he spent the remainder of his long life . Here his fame steadily grew as he poured forth his powerful and voluminous body of literary work . For a generation he was a venerated teacher and an accepted prophet of his time . In 1866 he was made Lord Rector of the University of Edinburgh ; but this mark of his triumph was embittered by the death of his wife . He died in 1881 , full of years and honors , and was buried among his own kindred in his native village of Ecclefechan . Carlyle began his literary work as early as 1823 , and continued it until his death . His first publication was a translation of Goethe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and this was soon followed by numerous translations from the German . These works are especially important as indicating the influence exerted upon his earlier development by German ideas and German literary tendencies . More than any other one man , Goethe was his ideal and his master . Carlyle was a man of very different temper from the great German . The latter was a large , broad , serene nature , while the inspired Scotchman was narrow , bigoted , intense , but tremendously forceful . Nevertheless , there seems to // have been something of natural affinity between the two , as there was also between Carlyle and the general temper of the German mind . This illustrates in its way the growing cosmopolitanism of literature which finds so many illustrations during the nineteenth century . Carlyle 's own later work has many reminders of this modern condition of affairs . Especially does his first great masterpiece , Sartor Resartrus , show the influence of German ideas . Carlyle 's work is exceedingly voluminous , and can not here be considered in detail . There are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic genius and his typical modes of thought , and these may receive brief individual notice as specimens of the whole . Sartor Resartos is one of the most astonishing and unique books of the century . The title means " the tailor retailored , " and suggests symbolically Carlyle 's main a so-called " philosophy of clothes , " and mingles Carlyle 's theory of the universe and of man with a good deal of autobiographical matter setting forth his spiritual experiences . The work is grotesque , both in conception and in style . It is terrible , in its revelation of Carlyle 's spiritual struggles . It is profound , in its deep and far-reaching philosophy . It is tremendously powerful , in its emotional intensity and in its imaginative vigor . The singular book is too confused , too complicated , too rich in suggestion , too profound in thought , to allow of brief exposition . It must suffice , therefore , to indicate its main purpose . By " clothes " Carlyle meant the outward vesture and wrappings of the essential reality . The forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , deeds , and expressions ? all are " clothes . " In the deepest interpretation , these are only the outward symbols of the spiritual facts which // they enshrine . The universe , at the heart of it , is not material but spiritual . The book is the symbol of Carlyle 's spiritual philosophy ; and it sets forth the bitter agony of his own struggle out of the depths into the light . Carlyle 's next great work was The French Revolution . It is more like a great epic poem than like a sober history . Carlyle believed with Macaulay that history should be made alive to the imagination ; but how vastly different from Macaulay 's are his methods and results . Of the gift of clear and orderly narrative , he displays little ; but his power of vivid and picturesque description and his genius for the dramatic realization of historic characters have never been surpassed since Shakespeare . His faculty of pouring out his own passionate emotion into his descriptions , of making himself as it were an actor in his dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " Reign of Terror , " the tremendous and almost superhuman actors in the great tragedy of the Revolution , find in him their master and their inspired delineator . He seemed , indeed , the man born for such a task . He could ' ride that whirlwind undismayed . He could select from all its weltering confusions the men and the events that were most dramatic , most significant , most symbolic , and could make them stand forth in all their living colors and in all their historic meaning . It is unlike any other book that has ever been written , it is unlike any book that ever will be written , on the same theme . Others may give us the facts of the history in more orderly array . Carlyle has given us a picture that moves and breathes with his own intense life . Heroes and Hero- Worship is one of Carlyle 's most characteristic productions . It sets forth his distinctive theory that " universal history , the , history of - what man has accomplished in this world , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked here . " // Such men are the world 's " real kings , " the men who have the right to rule , and whom other men have the duty to obey and to follow . The work is in form a series of six lectures on " the heroic in history . " The titles of the several lectures will convey the best idea of their scope : " The Hero as Divinity . ? Odin . ? Paganism : Scandinavian Mythology " ; " The Hero as Prophet. ? Mahomet : Islam " ; " The Hero as Poet . ? Dante : Shakespeare " ; " The Hero as Priest ? Luther ; Reformation : Knox ; Puritanism " ; " The Hero as Man of Letters. ? Johnson , Rousseau , Burns " ; " The Hero as King. ? Cromwell , Napoleon : Modern Revolutionism . " Nothing save the actual reading of them can convey an idea of their singular character and of their marvelous style . They embody much of Carlyle 's characteristic attitude toward modern democracy . They show that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the world 's men of supreme genius and character . Heroworship seemed to him a lesson that democracy needed to learn . Carlyle 's attitude toward great men is still further illustrated by his series of biographies . We have already mentioned his Life of Schiller . There are various essays that have more or less of a biographical character . Carlyle loved to seize on a striking or heroic figure and give it illustration on a larger or smaller scale . One of his favorite heroes was Oliver Cromwell ; and his Cromwell 's Letters and Speeches is one of his most sympathetic as well as scholarly pieces of work . As might be expected , Carlyle does not allow Cromwell to speak altogether for himself . The letters and speeches are given " with elucidations , " and Carlyle " elucidates " in his own characteristic fashion . Sometimes he flings his own dramatic word into the very midst of one of Cromwell 's speeches in a way that reminds us of his habit of making himself an actor in the scenes of his French Revolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and restrained but not less deeply sympathetic biography of his personal friend . More heroic in proportions is his History of Frederick the Great , a magnificent historical panorama in twenty-one books . The great builder of the Prussian kingdom and layer of foundations for the German Empire is portrayed in living colors against the background of the history of his age . Frederick ? Carlyle recognizes ? was no demigod , rather a very " questionable hero " ; but he was after all " a reality , " a genuine " king . " Carlyle 's distaste for the democracy and the materialism of his day led him to glorify the past as an age of obedience and of faith . In Past and Present , he has past and drawn a strikingly effective contrast . Book II of this work , entitled " The Ancient Monk , " gives a picture of life in the Middle Ages which has never been surpassed for imaginative vividness and which has also the merit of historical fidelity . Book III , entitled " The Modern Worker , " expresses his vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapters are entitled " Gospel of Mammonism " and " Democracy . " These titles indicate some of the targets at which his shafts were aimed . Carlyle 's own " Gospel , " whose main features have already been suggested in one way or another , is largely contained in this book ; but it is still further emphasized and expanded in works like Chartism , Latter-Day Pamphlets , The Nigger Question , and Shooting Niagara : and After . The first of these deals , in an exceedingly undemocratic spirit , with the labor question . The second discusses various modern topics . The third is a sarcastic fling at the sentimentalism of the abolitionists . The last suggests that the democratic , industrial , materialistic age is approaching the brink of a tremendous cataract , and Carlyle 's prophetic spirit forebodes only disaster and ruin . a // It will have already become apparent that behind Carlyle 's literary genius there was the potent strength of a great character , an original personality , and a profound life experience . That genius itself is not easy to analyze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is probable that the greatest force in his literary work is its vehement , deep , and lofty passion . Carlyle 's heart was like a volcano , making lurid the heavens with its flames and carrying devastation in the path of its consuming streams . Carlyle was also possessed of a great creative imagination . His power of vision was almost supernatural . He worked in the realm of fact ; but he possessed an immense capability of " realizing " fact in vivid shapes , and of clothing fact in ideal garments . His imaginative faculty is chiefly displayed in the dramatic portrayal of historical characters . He had the instinctive feeling for beauty which is an , element of the poetic nature , but he had little regard for the claims of beauty as compared with the claims of truth . Truth was the ruling passion of his nature , and all his books impress one with their craving for reality . The style in which he expressed himself is strongly marked by the idiosyncrasies of his own nature . It is passionate ; it is vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rich with imagery ; it is weighty with meaning and with power . Carlyle cares little for the rules of rhetoric and has not a slavish regard even for those of grammar . He is loose , fragmentary , interjectional , bold to excess . He cares only to express his meaning and to make his desired impression . If he startles , astounds , sometimes disgusts , all this is a part of his purpose . He will keep his reader awake at all hazards , and he will make him feel as with the tingling of electric shocks . It is certainly one of the least " classical , " one of the most individual , styles ever written . He may be accused , as De Quincey on far // different grounds accused Keats , of " trampling upon his mother-tongue as with the hoofs of a buffalo . " Nevertheless , his style is powerful , imaginative , rhythmic , massive ? touched at times with poetic beauty or poetic splendor ? sounding all the notes of emotion , from sublimity to violent energy , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fitting and adequate expression of a great soul . John Ruskin was a disciple of Carlyle , and had many of the peculiarities of his master with reference to his modes of thought and with reference to his attitude toward the age . Yet Ruskin was a man of far different genius , and in some respects of far different character . The moral effect of the work of the two mein is not so very fat- apart ; the purely literary effect is decidedly different . Ruskin was almost , if not quite , as dogmatic as Carlyle , and hardly less self-willed . Moreover , he had the like combination of an erratic manner and mode of expression with a spiritual tone and purpose that was at bottom ever one and the same . Both men were " wandering barks , " sailing to all appearance under the direction of a capricious master , but guided in all their wanderings by the clear sight of the polar star . It is perhaps not unworthy of note that , while Carlyle was a thorough and typical Scotchman , Ruskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an arbitrary will with a strongly religious temperament seems peculiarly Scotch . Ruskin had comparatively little sympathy with democracy in the stricter sense of the term ; but he had a deep and ever growing sympathy with the poor and the oppressed , a sympathy with the essential spirit of democratic ideals especially on the sociological side . In order to be helpful to his fellow men , he wrote , he labored , he spent practically the whole of his large // fortune . Ruskin had quite as little sympathy as Carlyle with the materialistic tendencies of science ; but with its larger spirit , he was in substantial harmony . He had the passionate love of truth which was even more than the intellectual ardor of the scientist . He had a love for nature which combined the spirit of the scientific investigator , the poet , and the artist . He had an eye for natural fact which no student of science could surpass . His temperament was perhaps more than anything else that of the artist . He was in his generation an apostle of beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of righteousness , in thought , in feeling , and in living . He possessed the practical gifts of the artist ; but he chose to set them aside in order that he might call attention to the beauty in the works of other men . He possessed also the gifts of literary genius ; but these , too , he chose to sacrifice to his task as a preacher of the gospel of beauty . If he attained literary fame , it was because his genius could not be suppressed , because his preaching necessarily took on those great qualities of substance and form that made it literature . For all this Ruskin was rather scoffed at by many as being chimerical and quixotic . Nothing could better illustrate this attitude or his own nobility of spirit than a passage from his Fors Clauigera , an autobiographic work written toward the latter part of his career : Because I have passed my life in almsgiving , not in fortune-hunting ; because I have laboured always for the honour of others , not for my own , and have chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to form or exhibit the skill of my own hands ; because I have lowered my rents , and assured the comfortable lives of my poor tenants , instead of taking from them all I could force for the roofs they needed ; because I love a wood walk better than a London street ; and would rather watch a sea gull fly than shoot it , and rather hear a thrush sing than eat it ; finally , because I never disobeyed my mother , because I have honoured all women with solemn worship , and have been kind even to the unthankful and evil ; therefore , the hacks of English art and literature wag their heads at me. // A large part of Ruskin 's work , and especially of his earlier work , was in the form of art criticism . His first notable work was a book entitled Modern Painters , which he afterward modified and expanded Art Critic through a series of years . It was not , as its title might suggest , a history of modern painting , but rather a glorification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painters . The book , especially in its enlarged form , goes much further ; for Ruskin enters into elaborate discussion of art theories , of the characteristics of various schools , of the true and the false in art , and especially of the relation of art to nature . This interest in landscape and the recognition of its place in art associates itself with the naturalistic movement in poetry , already discussed . It associates itself , however , quite as much with modern scientific study of nature ; for Ruskin was concerned even more with natural truth than with natural beauty . Other art works of importance are his Seven Lamps of Architecture and his Stones of Venice . The former of these aptly illustrates the very important fact that Ruskin believed the inspiration of all true art to lie in the moral nature of the artist and of his age , and also the further and greater fact that all Ruskin 's work ? of whatever name or nature ? is at bottom dealing with moral questions . The " Seven Lamps " are these : Sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Obedience . They suggest much as to Ruskin 's spirit and method . The Stones of Venice is a work of larger scope , but it is informed by the same general purpose . The effect of the three works taken together is to show Ruskin 's conception that the natural world is the expression of the divine mind and filled therefore with spiritual suggestion , and that all human art must find its highest power in fidelity to nature and in humble obedience to moral law . Such doctrine as this , Ruskin preached to his generation ; and he preached it with a prophetic // fervor , not merely because he wished to see modern life made more beautiful , but because he believed that beauty is at bottom a matter of righteousness . This same zeal of the prophet inspired also his later writings . About 186o , when Ruskin was just past forty years of age , he practically brought to an end his career as an art critic by the completion of his Modern Painters . He had labored nearly twenty years in the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but from this time forward , he was to give himself more especially to a higher and a nobler service . For nearly forty years more his life was to continue , closing only with the last year but one of the century ; and during this period , his literary work was to be that of a great ethical teacher and social reformer . He dealt with all sorts of subjects , there was in his writings an ever recurring allusion to art and to beauty ; but still more , there was the prevalent tone of a deep moral earnestness , the voice of a man whose supreme desire was to better the condition of his fellows and to teach them that righteousness is the great law of life . It is no more within our present scope to consider his various efforts outside of the literary field for the betterment of humanity than to consider the specific value of his work as a technical critic of art . These matters are , of course , important to an understanding of the man and of his total achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , moreover , his work in literature was in essentially the same spirit as his work in other fields . Most of the works of this later period bear fanciful titles which only remotely suggest or symbolize their real subject-matter . Unto this Last and Munera Pnlvcris are two books written against the narrowness and utilitarianism of the current political economy . Ruskin would have men consider that there are higher values than those which mere commercialism takes // into account . The Crown of Wild Olives consists of three lectures on " Work , Traffic , and War . " Ethics of the Dust is a series of ten lectures " to Little Housewives on the Elements of Crystallisation . " Fors Clavigera is a series of letters " to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain , " and contains much autobiographical matter . Prceterita is also autobiographical . Probably his best-known work is Sesame and Lilies . It is brief , and contains some of the best illustrations of his style .

Another division , " Queens ' Gardens , " deals with the place , power , and education of women . Ruskin was a man who possessed a fine imagination and an almost poetic appreciation of beauty . These were perhaps the basis of his purely literary genius , although , of course , his noble character and his high ethical spirit largely determined the quality of his literary work . It is with his style , however , that the literary student must be chiefly impressed . This is highly ornate and musical , reminding us somewhat of De Quincey 's imaginative and impassioned prose . It has reminders , too , of the early seventeenth-century prosewriters ; but more than to any other scource , it owes its distinguishing qualities to the English Bible . He had been deeply familiar with the Book from his earliest years , and its sublime strains had become a part of his intellectual inheritance . Magnificent as it is , this style can not justly be charged with affectation or artificiality . He rises to his heights of inspired eloquence or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion and kindling imagination ; and the style is the natural and almost inevitable expression of the man . As we come to the consideration of Matthew Arnold , we are struck by the fact that , of the four great prose-writers // who best represent the present period , only one was in full harmony with its spirit . Macaulay was a typical man of his time , accepting its ideals and voicing its characteristic ideas . Carlyle and Ruskin , as we have just seen , were in many respects in an attitude of antagonism to the spirit of the age , and felt called upon to be its censors and critics , although they too were , of course , unconsciously affected by its power . Matthew Arnold was also a censor , a critic , and in some sense a prophet , of his time . Carlyle preached the doctrine of duty and work and obedience . Ruskin preached the gospel of beauty , in form and in spirit . Arnold was preeminently the apostle of culture . " Sweetness and light " was the phrase that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By it he referred to gentility of manners and to intellectual refinement . His conception of culture is acquaintance with " the best that has been known and thought in the world . " As compared with the " Hebraism " of Carlyle and to some extent of Ruskin , Arnold 's ideal was found rather in " Hellenism . " It was the ideal of ideas as compared with the ideal of conduct and duty . Arnold believed in the potency of ideas , and sought to aid their triumph over the narrow-minded , complacent , insular , and puritanical spirit of " Philistinism . " With democracy , he had comparatively little to do , one way or the other . His own personal temper was that of an intellectual aristocrat . With science , he had to do in two ways . Directly , it helps to account for the keen , analytical , observant temper of his mind . Indirectly , it unsettled his religious faith . With the sadness , the melancholy , and the resignation which this induced , we shall have to do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attitude was intellectual and logical . It was that of the stoic , who will put away all outworn illusions , will face the situation as it is , will " see life steadily and see it whole , " and will take refTHE // uge in ideas . It was that of the cultured man of the world ? urbane , polished , intellectual , and withal " a friend and helper of those who would live in the spirit . " Arnold 's most important work in prose was that of a literary critic . Here he was classical , comparative , sane , impartial , and acute . He brought literature to the test of the highest ideals , and applied those ideals with rare judgment and insight , if with something more than a tinge of dogmatism . From 1857 to 1867 , he was Professor of Poetry at Oxford , and his lectures in that position exerted a wide influence upon current criticism and ideas of literature . The most important fruits of this work were two famous productions , On Translating Homer and On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essays in Criticism , and twenty-three years later , in the year of his death , added to this a second series under the same title . Other volumes largely of a literary character were his Mixed Essays ( 1879 ) , Irish Essays ( 1882 ) , and Discourses in America ( 1885 ) . In these various books , his criticism took a wide range and displayed a taste catholic as well as just . He dealt with Greek , French , German , as well as British , authors , and brought to bear a comparative criticism that was both suggestive and stimulating . His ideals were classical rather than romantic , his method was perhaps rather judicial than sympathetic ; but everywhere there is the evidence of a cultivated intelligence and of keen critical insight . Arnold 's true province as a prosewriter was that of literary criticism ; but he did not always confine himself to that field . His Schools and Universities on the Continent shows his interest in education ; and as an expert in educational matters , he had a right to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on social and ethical questions , and it is in this sphere that he best displays his relation to the age . He even made an excursion into the field of theological controversy in // such works as Culture and Anarchy ( 1869 ) , St. Paul and Protestantism ( 1870 ) , Literature and Dogma ( 1873 ) , and God and the Bible ( 1875 ) . Here , perhaps , his venture was less fortunate ; but these works help to define for us Arnold 's character and intellectual attitude , to make clearer the influence upon him of the great movements of the age , and to emphasize his peculiar relation to his own time . Arnold 's genius on the prose side was , as we have intimated , that of a great literary critic and apostle of culture . He was also one of the great poets of his age , and will call for prominent treatment in our later consideration of the poetry of the time . It remains here to observe that he was also a great master of prose style . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruskin and Carlyle . He had next to nothing of their vehemence , their richness , their music , or their imaginative splendor . His qualities , are those of the intellect rather than those of passion or imagination . His characteristic virtues are those of lucidity , serenity , simplicity , purity , suavity , terseness , precision . To all this he added the Attic salt of a spicy humor and of a delicate irony . He is great with the greatness of a calm and pure intelligence . CHAPTER XVI THE AGE OF TENNYSON ? THE NOVEL ( 1832 ? 1892 ) IN our consideration of the history of the modern novel , we have seen that it began in realism , under the classical influences of the eighteenth century . Later , under the influence of a growing romanticism , the novel also became romantic . Scott was the great romancer , and under his auspices the romantic novel came to the place of first importance in the field of prose fiction . Nevertheless , such work as that of Jane Austen had more than preserved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of a broad and many-sided inheritance from the past development of the novel . On the whole , the history of the novel during this period is a history of change from romanticism back to realism , with certain marked tendencies toward romantic reaction . This seems altogether natural . The spirit of individualism that prevailed in the age of Scott tended mainly toward the freedom of romance , although , as we have seen , there was a side on which it tended toward the encouragement of realism . Individualism under the more concrete form of democracy was likely to emphasize the realistic view of life by emphasizing the place and importance of the ordinary man . This tendency toward realism was reenforced by the influence of science . Science had given men a new insight into psychological as well as into physical facts , it had taught methods of intellectual analysis that supplemented the imaginative insight of genius , it had brought new conceptions of man 's 359 // relations to society and of his place in the universe . All this gave to real life a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh zeal in the study of its actual phenomena . The romantic fiction of the age was largely written in a spirit of protest or of escape . Its writers struggled against the coldness and bareness of the scientific aspect of things , or else they tried to escape from it into the world of dreams . Some , however , took a better view . They found new marvels in the revelations of science which they displayed as more romantic than Gulliver or the " Gothic " romance of terror . This points to still another fact ; namely , that the boundaries between romance and realism were to some extent obscured . Each used in a measure the materials and the methods of the other , and thereby enlarged the boundaries of its own province . The amount of work produced in the various departments of the novel was immense . The necessary limitations of a brief discussion will therefore compel us to a more than usually rigid selection and exclusion . Three novelists of the age stand out from the crowd ? Dickens , Thackeray , and George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were also typical , in a sense that makes them illustrative of the principal facts and movements of their age . To these three , then , we may devote our attention with the assurance that they will be found largely representative of the history of fiction in their time . Charles Dickens was in many ways in harmony with the spirit of his generation , but with striking personal peculiarities . No author of the period save Robert Browning better illustrates the necessity of taking into account the personal equation in literary work . At the basis of his genius lies his broad and intimate familiarity with men and things . He was by nature a shrewd and accurate observer of // life ; and his own practical experiences had brought him to a close knowledge of its realities and even of its hardships . Born in Portsmouth in 1812 , he was early removed to London with his family , and learned there to know the privations and sordid cares of humble life in the great city . At ten years of age , he was working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt in the Marshalsea Prison . His literary apprenticeship was served as a newspaper reporter and later as a magazine and newspaper editor . Experience as an amateur actor also contributed to the training which was to take the place of a university education in preparing him for his life work . Literary work began early and was almost immediately successful . Few writers have been so popular as Dickens or have lived to reap such abundant literary honors . His life was prematurely shortened in 187o , by the excitement and the physical strain of his public readings before vast and enthusiastic audiences in England and America . Dickens had certain points of contact with the realistic school , although he is by no means to be called a realist . His personal experiences gave him opportunity for wide and varied knowledge of English life . Within this field , he best knew the middle and lower classes , and nothing was more familiar to him than the life of London streets and homes . One of the most interesting minor features of his novels lies in his particular acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . Readers of Dickens will recall many illustrations of this from works like Our Mutual Friend , Bleak House , The Old Curiosity Shop , and David Copperfield . The last of these is in effect an idealization of actual experiences from his own life . His subjects are drawn almost entirely from the life of the English common people . Even in a novel like A Tale of Two Cities , in which he deals // with events of the French Revolution , a very large proportion of the book is taken up with description of English life and especially the life of London . If Dickens is a realist in knowledge of actual life and in choice of subjects , he is anything but a realist in his methods of treatment . He handles his real subject-matter with the greatest freedom . We can hardly call him a romantic novelist , for his field lies rather between the territories of realism and romance . For lack of a better term , he might be designated an idealist in fiction . This means to imply that his novels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , are an extreme idealization of the actual and the familiar . He takes liberties with the literal facts of life in the portrayal of character and perhaps still more in the construction of plot . What he seeks is not primarily a faithful picture of life as it is . He displays that life rather in the light which his singular fancy has shed around it . Often he is concerned with the attack or defence of some moral principle , and portrays life in a way to suit his immediate purpose . Illustrations of this are to be found in such books as Dombey and Son , Little Dorrit , and Nicholas Nicklcby . In all his works , we may see his marked disposition toward partisanship for or against his various characters . He applauds and rewards the good , he condemns and arbitrarily punishes the bad . In a word , . there is lack of that artistic impartiality which characterizes a great master like Shakespeare . What we shall have occasion to see is that Dickens supplies this lack by other remarkable powers and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must probably seek the deepest secret of Dickens 's genius in his emotional nature . He had intense power of feeling , and his feeling was easily aroused . His emotions were not inspired primarily by literaTHE // ture , by the ideals of his art , or even by the strong impulse to personal expression . Their inspiration was rather in the human spectacle which he saw around him . He was profoundly interested in the joys and sorrows and manifold experiences of men and women , and he was profoundly moved by them . His deep and strong sympathies were always on the side of truth , morality , and religion . The two most characteristic emotions of his nature were pathos and humor . These seemingly opposite feelings have not seldom been found in harmony with each other in great men of genius ; and in Dickens , they met in a rare and happy union . On the one side , we feel the deep tenderness of his nature , and are witness of his power over the softer emotions of the human heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dickens will recall such examples as the death of Little Nell , of Little Jo , and of Paul Dombey ; and these are only extreme illustrations of what is to be found in greater or less degree in all his novels . He has been charged with sentimentalism , with exaggeration , with " pumping for tears , " and there is something of justice in the charge ; but nevertheless , his pathos is an element of undoubted power in his work and helps in large measure to account for its popularity . Over against his pathos is his humor ? not delicate , subtle , and half melancholy , as we might expect , but rather of the broad and boisterous kind . Hearty laughter , playful irony , potent ridicule , a singular love of the grotesque ? these are some of the characteristics of Dickens 's humor . We may declare without qualification that he is one of the world 's great humorists . Whatever other limitations upon his art may be allowed , there surely can not be much room for cavil here . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while at the same time it accounts for much that is strange , dis364 DEMOCRACY AND SCIENCE ( 1832-1892 ) torted , and exaggerated in his work as a novelist . The ) relation of Dickens to the art of novel-writing is a somewhat peculiar one . He is a caricaturist of life and character rather than a painter of portraits . Yet let us recognize that the caricaturist has also a genuine and deep , as well as a keen , insight into life , and that he is in his way just as truly a revealer of its meanings . Dickens is not really to be understood by those who fail to comprehend his singular union of humor and pathos and the effect of this on his work . They judge him by the standards of other men and expect from him similar results . He must be judged by his own standard , and his results must be appreciated as the outcome of his own very peculiar genius . Next to the emotional power of Dickens , we must note the power of his imagination . Great emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might expect , the imaginative activity of Dickens is easily aroused . And when it is aroused , how astonishing are its creations . We are struck by its variety and its fertility ; its resources seem inexhaustible and its possible shapes almost infinite . We are impressed by its clearness and its minuteness ; there seems to be a perfect conception of objects even to their slightest details . There is comparatively little penetration into essential realities ; but there is a wonderful power of effective combination . Dickens is less a revealer of life 's mystery than a portrayer of its visible fact . The remarkable peculiarities of his pictures are largely accounted for by the marvelous intensity and vividness of his imagination . He sees the ideal almost as . vividly as the actual . Objects stand forth with a distinctness comparable to that of a landscape revealed in a sudden glare of lightning . Inanimate things even seem to be endowed with life and sensibility . This activity of his imagination is undoubtedly largely affected // by his pathos and his humor . These help to account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its grotesqueness ; but apart from other influences , much is due to its own sportive and fantastic nature . Dickens 's technical art as a novelist is not quite equal to the real force of his genius . On the side of his style , he can not be called a great master . This may in part be accounted for on general grounds Masters of style among the great novelists are the exception rather than the rule ; and the explanation probably is that in most cases the writer 's energy and attention are engaged with the processes of invention to the comparative neglect of the matter of expression . Dickens is inclined to a decided carelessness in style , and at times even to coarseness . While his style is undoubtedly effective for its purpose , it lacks those minute perfections or those magic splendors which characterize the very greatest work in prose expression . When we come to the more important matters of his art , Dickens 's real mastery begins to appear . He is a great story-teller . His plots are large , varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handling of the broad and intricate construction . What is still more apparent , he is a wonderful inventor of incident , and is able by this means alone to hold the unflagging interest of the reader . There is some tendency to looseness and digression in his stories ; but this is hardly more than might be expected , and is lost sight of in the interest of the whole and in the fascination of the details . An incalculable aid to his narrative is the clearness and vividness of his description . It is often highly idealized , but it never fails of distinctness or of life . It is probably in the creation of character that his greatest genius is displayed . His characters are in a sense representative of the author 's theories and purposes rather than of human life . It may also be said that they are typical of virtues and vices // rather than of men and women . It may be still further added that they are frequently exaggerated and fanciful . All this is true , but it does not serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame . In spite of all the limitations that have been justly urged , but urged perhaps too much , Dickens is still to be regarded as a great creator of character . The imagination is the court of last resort for judging the works of the imagination ? not any supposed standard of observation or experience ; and to the imagination , the characters of Dickens declare themselves alive ? thoroughly English , thoroughly human , thoroughly lifelike , in spite of all limitation . They are alive with the superabundant vitality of their creator . It is not the least of his peculiarities that Dickens identifies himself with his work , becoming as it were the companion of his characters as well as their maker . The effect of this on his work is not altogether happy , any more than is the effect of his constant introduction of a practical purpose into his stories of life ; but none of these things vitally affect the real power and impressiveness of his novels . When all is said , it remains true that Dickens is one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously criticised , and he is fairly open to serious criticism , on more than merely technical grounds . His exaggeration , his sensationalism , his sentimentality , his coarseness , his didacticism , are all fair objects of attack . If he is great in spite of these faults , it is because he opposes to them much greater virtues . He teaches the essential truth of life , even if he does distort the outward fact . He is not only a great preacher and moralist , but he is a truly great artist as well . Notwithstanding his seeming affectations , he is at bottom sincere , simple , tender , genial , manly , and true . His greatness is due to a high development of certain remarkable powers . His limitations are due to the comparative failure , // of certain other powers and to a lack of proportion and harmony between his various artistic qualities . His abiding reputation will be that of a great humorist , a great novelist , and a great master of the human heart . There are some points of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their paths diverge . The difference appears first of all in their lives . Thackeray was born in Calcutta in 1811 , but was early sent to England for education at the famous Charterhouse School in London . From here he went to Trinity College , Cambridge , but did not remain long at the University . After spending some time in travel and in study of art on the continent , he returned to London and began his literary career . His fame grew slowly but surely until his death in 1863 . The insanity of his wife brought an element of deep pathos into his life , but his last days were comparatively happy and serene . Thackeray may be called a novelist of life and manners . This implies that he was the painter of an age and of a particular state of society rather than of essential humanity . Such an implication would be in the main just , although we must guard ourselves from the error of supposing that he was entirely limited to a narrow field or that his work has no large human significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always be true , to the characteristics of general humanity . It may be said that he was a student of life rather than of the individual soul . The actual field of life which he chose for that study was a comparatively limited one . It was the life of English high society , a life of artificial and conven tional manners . It was a less fruitful field than that of Dickens , who had more opportunity to observe the natural workings of the human heart . Nevertheless , if one could see beneath the surface , humanity was there , however falsified and concealed . Within his limits , // Thackeray finds ' a considerable variety of character , al . though the natural tendency of an artificial society is to restrict individuality and to reduce all characters to a few well-known types . To a certain extent this tendency is observable in Thackeray 's portrayal . Indeed , he occasionally has almost repetitions of character . An interesting case is that of William Dobbin , in Vanity Fair , who seems like a preliminary study for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newcome , of The Newcomes . Thackeray shows in all his novels a real knowledge of the human heart , and is a past master in his acquaintance with the social conditions that he portrays . His method of treatment is decidedly realistic . He has no disposition to idealize life or to seize only on its romantic elements . On the contrary , his chief impulse is toward a graphic portrayal of actual facts and conditions . This portrayal is not to be called either superficial or profound . Thackeray certainly does go beneath the mere surface of life ; but just as certainly he does not fathom the depths . In the construction of his novels , life and character are much more important than plot . He introduces a moral purpose , but in his own way . It is not as with Dickens the purpose to reform institutions or to advocate a particular cause ; it is rather to attack human weakness and folly and to rebuke a system of life . On the surface , Thackeray was a man of the world , acquainted with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanness and hollowness of polite society ; and his knowledge results in disillusion , both for himself and for his reader . We are led behind the scenes , and shown the tinsel and the sham which make up the fine-appearing spectacle . The result is that Thackeray is apparently a cynic and a pessimist . Such a conclusion , however , would not be justified by a deeper knowledge of the facts . He was , indeed , a spirit quick to // scorn and despise , a good hater of all sham and pretence , of all vileness and meanness . Ever ready he was with his mocking laughter and his potent ridicule . On any due occasion , he was capable of the most scathing irony and of the most bitter sarcasm . Yet , rightly understood , this was only the surface of the man . Beneath that surface was a most genuine and manly and noble spirit . Thackeray was a believer in the essential goodness of humanity , although he understood so much of its littleness and its badness . He was a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bitter words . Beneath his satirical manner , he hid a tender and compassionate heart . Moreover , Thackeray was a man of faith and hope . If he saw things as they were , with the scientific clearness and frankness of his age , if he put away all illusion , he nevertheless found it possible to discover the spiritual element in life and to have faith in what men might be and in what already they largely were . All his scorn and bitterness grew , not out of a petty or churlish spirit , but out of the real nobility of his nature . It grew out of his intense indignation against the vile and the false , and his no less intense love for the true and the pure . His work is marked by a customary restraint of emotion , in sharp contrast with the rather excessive display of feeling in the work of Dickens . Nevertheless , Thackeray was a man of strong and deep feeling . Beyond the evidence of his work there is the evidence of the patience and loving-kindness of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very unlike that of Dickens , but the two men were at least alike in being keen observers of life . This , of course , was of especial importance to a realistic novelist like Thackeray . His knowledge of life was accurate , and his purpose was to be equally accurate in the portrayal . For such a purpose , observation is much , insight // is more . If Thackeray 's insight was not profound , it was at least genuine and just , and fitted him for the portrayal of life in more than a merely superficial sense . Such knowledge of life as came to him in these ways , he had the gift to use as a fine artist in the realm of fiction . Perhaps his most remarkable power is his ability in characterization . He is subtle in his analysis of human feeling and motive . He is for the most part truly original in his conceptions . His characters are his own , and yet are created with fidelity to the great copy which he found in real life . The characters thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living beings that appeal to the imagination . Beyond the ability to portray individual characters is the ability to portray a large and faithful picture of life . Here , also , Thackeray 's fine imagination is equal to its task . It is clear , penetrating , vivid , fertile , genuinely creative . Less vigorous than that of Dickens , it is more restrained and better balanced . Its results are symmetrical , orderly , precise . The pictures which his imagination creates are given depth and solidity by the fact that Thackeray was a really serious thinker . His reflections on human life have a value largely independent of the particular forms through which they are presented . On this side of his work , he appeals more to mature minds . Dickens is the novelist of the young , the vigorous , the hopeful , the sanguine . Thackeray is rather the novelist of the experienced , the thoughtful , and the reflective , and to appreciate him fully requires a certain degree of mental growth . Thackeray 's emotional power is quiet , regulated , restrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is comparatively rare , but he shows himself capable on occasion of touching the heart 's tenderer emotions . There is hardly a finer illustration of quiet and restrained pathos in all English fiction than his brief account of the death of old Colonel Newcome . As a humorist , his power // is freely displayed . He ranges from broad and almost farcical humor to the keenest sarcasm and the most delicate irony . As a rule , however , his humor is not the hearty and boisterous humor of Dickens , but is more subtle , keen , refined , bitter , an exceedingly effective weapon of satire and ridicule . It can hardly be called altogether amiable . Thackeray laughs at the world rather than with it , and uses his powers of wit not so much to delight as to sting . Another characteristic emotion is his moral indignation . Often veiled , seldom expressed in direct and formal terms , it is none the less powerfully felt in his portrayal of life and in his characteristic comment upon the doings of men and women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength , is an intense love of moral beauty . If Thackeray portrays for the most part those phases of life that deserve his satire , if he represents the wickedness and the weakness of the world , he has nevertheless a noble appreciation of all that is pure and sweet and genuine in character . His pictures of life exalt beauty by contrast and suggestion rather than by direct presentation ; but he makes us feel that in spite of all the evil and the littleness of the world there is yet much in it of the savor of true goodness . Thackeray is not a great narrator . His plots are comparatively uninteresting , and he is largely lacking in the skill of the great literary architect . What he does possess is the power to present such a graphic and fascinating picture of men and women that the interest of the mere story is hardly missed . To this end contributes not a little his skill in graphic and suggestive description . Still further , he is one of the most finished masters of prose style among English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ease , incisiveness , and vivacity . The interest of Thackeray 's novels , as we have implied , is primarily an interest in men and women vividly portrayed . // His characters are well defined , individual , and lifelike . Work as a He portrays male characters better than feNovelist male , and mature persons better than children . The characters in any one of his novels are comparatively few in number , whereas Dickens crowds his stories with a great number of personages . These characters are so related to each other as to form a natural , consistent , and faithful picture of life , and to suggest the movements of the larger world outside their narrow circle . The narrative is subordinate in interest , but the thread of the story is sufficient to give unity to the whole . It is easy and graceful , but comparatively lacking in movement , in complication , in climax , and in dramatic effect . His descriptions , always admirable , are mostly of persons , situations , and conditions . There is little description of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoids , in Vanity Fair , an excellent opportunity to describe the battle of Waterloo . The proper business of conducting the story and portraying the characters is almost always accompanied in his novels with a running comment of satire on human follies and of moral reflections on life . These are exceedingly interesting for their own sake , independently of the story . To use his own figure , they are like the comments of the showman displaying his puppets . The effect of this on his art as a novelist is not altogether happy . Satire in art , if carried too far , tends to force the author upon us and tends also both to distract our attention from the characters and to distort them in the interests of the satirical purpose . Moralizing in art interrupts the story for the sake of the sermon and mars the proper unity , proportion , and continuity . If the moral purpose be less broad and human than Thackeray 's , it tends to destroy the work of art altogether . Taken as they are , his novels are full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may well forget all cavil in genuine gratitude and admiration . // What the novel could be , however , in such hands and without these objectionable features , Thackeray himself has shown us . In Heu1y Esmond , he has presented one of the most perfect historical pictures ever drawn ? a transcript from the life of the early part of the eighteenth century . The narrator of the story is Henry Esmond himself , and all satirical and moralizing comment on the part of the author is necessarily eliminated . As a result , we have an example of the art of prose fiction pure and simple . All Thackeray 's genius is there without its hindrances . It is his masterpiece , and in it his true greatness as a novelist is fully revealed . George Eliot was the pen name of Mary Ann Evans , hardly less than the greatest woman of genius in English literature . Her career is an illustration of the production of great art out of comparatively narrow conditions and out of comparatively humble materials . Like Jane Austen , she was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow life circle . Her native county was Warwickshire ? the county of Shakespeare ? but like Shakespeare , she transcends in spirit the bounds of Warwickshire and of England . For over thirty years , she lived in this quiet midland country , on the farm or in the quaint provincial town of Coventry . Her earliest acquaintance was with a life natural and unsophisticated ? a life where humanity was visible in its simplest and most typical forms . By insight into such life , she learned to know what life was in its depths quite as well as Dickens learned to know it by his wide acquaintance with English types of character or as Thackeray learned to know it by his study of London society . She was destined , however , to a far wider knowledge of the world and to a far larger intellectual development than these early years seemed to promise . In 1851 she settled in London as assistant editor of the Westminster Review , // and was there brought into association with the most prominent liberal thinkers of the day . Her union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of the utmost importance to her literary career ; for under his influence she came to a realization of her genius as a novelist . After his death , in 1878 , she was married to Mr. Cross , a London banker . She died in 188o , at the age of sixty-one . In spite of her broad experience of life and of her large intellectual culture , her temper remained thoroughly English . Through her provincial origin and sympathies , she had the roots of her genius deep in the soil of English life . Hers was the largest life from the narrowest circumstances , the broadest art through the most limited subject . At the basis of George Eliot 's character was her intense emotional nature . She had a heart full of tenderness and pity . Her loves and friendships make up much of the story of her life . Her experiences were such as to subject her emotional temper to an unusual development . The sorrows of her life , her deep heart experiences , her physical sufferings , her religious struggles , all tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide range of her emotional powers and experiences had an important influence upon her work ; for she learned how to portray in others the feeling that she had known herself . Hardly less important was her large intellectuality and her broad culture . Her mind seems in many ways masculine rather than feminine ; and all her work is evidence of her force and breadth , as well as of her subtlety , of intellect . Her life was largely spent in extensive reading and study ; and as a result , she had a wide knowledge of literature , history , and art . The conditions of the age brought this large heart and this large mind into conflict with one another . She was a woman of deep religious instinct , and her early religious experiences // were largely determined by her emotional nature . As she grew in mental power and in philosophical and scientific knowledge , her intellectuality radically affected her religious views . She passed through a time of doubt and struggle , but did not gain the spiritual victory of Carlyle . Her later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she yet found it impossible to believe , and accepted the conditions of the age and of her own mind with a sad sincerity . Her reverence of spirit remained the same . Her conscientiousness in life and in work are an inspiring example . Above all , the altruism which she believed in and preached reveals the tenderness , the unselfishness , the real devotion of her nature . Her greatness of spirit as well as her limitations of faith may be clearly seen in her poem beginning , O may I join the choir invisible Of those immortal dead who live again In minds made better by their presence : live In pulses stirred to generosity , In deeds of daring rectitude , in scorn For miserable aims that end with self , , In thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars , And with their mild persistence urge man 's search To vaster issues . " So to live , " she says , " is heaven " ; and this was the only heaven , the only immortality , in which she found it possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest . There was , at least , no pretence in her nature , either in religious or in other matters . Her character was , indeed , strikingly simple and sincere . While she was not a great poet , the passage just quoted is illustrative of the fact that she did produce a small body of pure and lofty verse . Doubtless this poetic element in her genius serves to touch her work as a novelist to finer issues . That work gains a unique quality also from the singular combination of masculine and feminine traits in her character . // Speaking more specifically of her genius as a novelist , we must first note her wonderful breadth of sympathy . Probably no English novelist has had a more profound or as a more catholic interest in human life , and the same spirit is shown in her love for nature and for domestic animals . Such sympathy is the first condition of understanding , and it is clear that George Eliot did understand . The depth of her insight was matched by its delicacy ; for she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refined subtlety of a woman . These gifts for the comprehension of human life were supplemented by equal gifts for presenting it in concrete forms . She had a great creative imagination . By its power she could conceive original , definite , and individual characters , and could body them forth in vivid reality . Nothing is more remarkable than her marvelous power of endowing her creatures with life . Seemingly without effort , she breathes into them her own living spirit , and makes them live and move , not as mere puppets , but as actual men and women . She is essentially a delineator of the soul , presenting man 's spiritual nature through his outward form and conduct . Yet , as we have implied , there is no lack of solid flesh and blood in her characters . Hers is not a presentation of the spirit instead of the flesh ; it is a presentation of the spirit through the flesh . Akin to this is her power to reach the universal through the local . In many of her novels , the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is broadly human and typical of man 's life under any conditions . She knows that if one will but go deep enough anywhere , he may reach essential human nature , that which makes the whole world kin . This contrast between the narrow life and the larger meaning is finely illustrated in Adam Bcdc , which is probably her masterpiece , and even more emphatically in Silas Hamer . She began by being a great observer , // viewing life accurately and endeavoring to portray it faithfully . She added to her fineness of observation a depth of insight and a sense of spiritual values which enabled her to portray the inward as well as the outward life . Moreover , she had power to discern the poetry and the beauty which lie beneath the surface of life and which sometimes transfigure the lowliest characters . She was , indeed , a lover of the beautiful in art , in nature , and in the human soul , and could discover the beauty of common things as well as of common men and women . Her emotional power is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathos is the simple and unforced pathos of human life and destiny . There is , on the one hand , no undue restraint , and on the other , no striving for mere effect . She is a great , humorist , not loud and boisterous like Dickens , not keenly satirical like Thackeray , but with a breadth , a healthiness , and a geniality quite in harmony with her sane and realistic view of life . George Eliot 's realism is of the highest and best type . Like both Dickens and Thackeray , she goes to the actual world for her subjects . She deals for the most part with English rural and provincial life , and especially with the lower and middle classes . This was the life she knew best and the life on which most of her greatest novels are based . She began her work in fiction with Scenes from Clerical Life , containing three separate stories associated with the general theme . The success of this work encouraged her to the writing of her first great novel , Adam Bede . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just such a rural community as that in which she grew up ; but it becomes even more than that by virtue of the profound passions by which its characters are moved . The Mill on the Floss and Silas Marner are novels of much the same general type . The former probably reflects in an indirect way much of her own personal feeling and // experience . The fatter is the most restricted in its subjectmatter of all her great works , and at the same time the most objective and most free from intrusion of the author 's personality . Middlemen-eh deals with life in a small provincial town , but its range and variety of character is somewhat greater . In Romola and in Daniel Deronda , she took a much wider sweep . The latter has been most criticised of all her novels , and is probably the least successful of her larger works . Remola has also found its critics , but it contains some of her most masterly work . It is a historical novel , dealing with Florentine life in the days of Savonarola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Italian reformer and the beauty-loving self-indulgence of the Greek Tito Melema calls forth some of her greatest powers . Everywhere George Eliot knows her subject . In the novels of English life , she knows it because she has been a living part of it . In such a work as Roma/a , she knows it by wide learning and by careful study . If she is less successful in work of the latter sort , it is because she could not possibly feel with her more remote characters quite the same vital sympathy that she feels with her own Warwickshire blood . This is a necessary limitation on all artists , and is not to be helped except by such intimate and profound knowledge of the general human heart as she undoubtedly possessed . Her manner of conception and her method of treatment make her works a study of life rather than a study of mere manners . She is concerned , not with the accidental , but with the essential . Her handling of life is truthful , but at the same time really imaginative and poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character ; and that study is made significant by the depth of her insight and by the subtlety of her analysis . These individual characters she is able to combine into a large and impressive picture of life . While her plots are always // subordinate , they are never uninteresting ; and if she has not quite the fascination of a great story-teller , like Scott or Dickens , she does possess a fair degree of skill in construction . The chief limitation on the general effect of many of her novels lies in her strong tendency to infuse into them a subjective element by means of her moral and philosophical reflections on the life that she is portraying . This same habit has been already noted in Thackeray , though in somewhat different form . In George Eliot , this tendency toward abstract thought instead of concrete portrayal is in peculiar contrast with her really great dramatic power . She portrays her characters without any infusion into them of her own personality , and then delivers her philosophical sermon as a thing almost apart . She was at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of character , and she was not quite able to keep her abstract thinking separate from her portrayal . In the main , her criticism of human life is both serious and conscientious , and falls short of the very greatest work only because she felt impelled to preach as well as to portray . Her novels are at least not marred by prejudice or by any satiric or merely didactic purpose ; and even her occasional moral dissertations are in harmony with her portrayal . She has of late been unduly depreciated ; but it is safe to say that her fame will eventually recover its own . Nothing can permanently obscure the fact that her novels are great works of art ? true , beautiful , and profound pictures of human life . In the creation of lifelike character , she has hardly had any superior since Shakespeare . With these three great novelists as chief examples of the voluminous fiction of the age , we must be here content . The briefest possible glance at the rest of the field will serve the simple purpose of illustrating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulwer-Lytton ( 1803 ? 1873 ) was a ver380 DEMOCRACY AND SCIENCE ( 1832-1892 ) satile novelist , sensitive to changes of literary fashion , He began as early as 1827 with novels of the " dandy " type . His taste was for romantic sentiment and for effects of criminal and supernatural terror . The influence of Scott turned him toward the historical novel , and here he produced some of his best works , like The Last Days of Pompeii and Harold . Still later , Thackeray turned him in the direction of realism . His last phase was again romantic , but in the fashion of the new age . Benjamin Disraeli ( 1804-1881 ) has some affinities with BulwerLytton , especially in his cleverness , versatility , brilliancy , and superficiality . His most effective novels are pictures of political and fashionable life in his own day . They are romantic , cynical , witty , imaginative ? the work of a brilliant man of the world rather than of a really great novelist . Anthony Trollope ( 1815-1882 ) was a sort of lesser Thackeray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English life ? clerical , political , commercial , and rural . His work is that of an industrious and competent literary craftsman , never rising very high and never falling very low . Charles Reade ( 1814 ? 1884 ) reminds us rather of Dickens . Led by the age to the choice of realistic subjects , his personal impulse was to deal with them in a romantic manner . His best work , The Cloister and the Hearth , is a historical novel . Charlotte Bronte ( 1816 ? 1855 ) suggests comparison with George Eliot , but the comparison is one of contrast . In a way quite her own , she presented real life in its romantic aspects . Charles Kingsley ( 1819 ? 1875 ) wrote some effective novels of purpose , with democratic leanings , and some still better historical novels . Robert Louis Stevenson ( 1845 ? 1894 ) brought back the atmosphere of true romance into English fiction . Sometimes it is the romance of pure adventure , as in Treasure Island , sometimes the deeper romance of the human spirit , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reaction from the realistic and scientific temper of the age . These are by no means all of the really important novelists of the time . They are simply the best or the most typical . These among the dead , together with George Meredith and others still among the living , are convincing illustrations of the fulness , richness , and power of the novel during the Victorian Period . THE AGE OF TENNYSON ? POETRY ( 1832-1892 ) OF the four poets who must be selected from the larger company to represent the poetry of the present age , Matthew Arnold was much the youngest and began his poetical career at considerably the latest date . That career , however , was almost entirely confined to the earlier part of his life , and was practically ended nearly a quarter of a century before the latest of the others had ceased to write . Arnold was born in 1822 , and was a son of Dr. Thomas Arnold , the famous head master of Rugby . After finishing his preliminary education at Rugby , he entered Balliol College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College . The religious controversies which were stirring the University in his time united with the general tendencies of the age to unsettle Arnold 's faith ; and the note of spiritual conflict is heard through much of his poetry as well as through his later prose . During the greater part of his life , he held the responsible position of an inspector of schools ; and from 1857 to 1867 he was professor of poetry at Oxford . His first volume of poems was published in 1848 , and his poetical period continued to the time of his Oxford professorship . After that time , he was almost exclusively a writer of prose until his death in 1888 . It will thus appear that his prose work was the product of his later life , while his poetry was the outcome of his younger manhood , before the chilling ' influences of the age had entirely silenced his poetic voice . The quality of his prose and its indication of the character of the man , we have 382 // already sufficiently considered . It remains here to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also throws upon his personality . Between Arnold 's poetry and his prose there is singular difference . He seems to have reserved for poetical expression those moods of sadness , of world- His spirit of weariness , of anguished doubt , and of stoical Doubt resignation and renunciation which probably represented what lay most deeply hidden in his nature . We hear the voice of one who has been disturbed to the very centre of his spiritual life by the doubt so prevalent during the middle years of the nineteenth century . The faith in which he had been reared failed him utterly , and seemed to be passing away also out of the world . He says in Dover Beach : The Sea of Faith Was once , too , at the full , and round earth 's shore Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furl 'd ! But now I only hear Its melancholy , long , withdrawing roar , Retreating , to the breath Of the night-wind , down the vast edges drear And naked shingles of the world . There could hardly be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There could hardly be a more beautiful one . He seems , as he says in his Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse , like one Wandering between two worlds , one dead , The other powerless to be born . Through most of his poetry this same spirit runs , this painful sense of The something that infects the world . To all this pain and emptiness , Arnold opposes first resignation , then duty . In the poem entitled Morality , he declares : // We can not kindle when we will The fire which in the heart resides ; The spirit bloweth and is still , In mystery our soul abides . But tasks in hours of insight willed Can be through hours of gloom fulfilled . In a poem like Palladium , as more or less in many others , it is made clear to us that Arnold has a still further consolation . Doubt has not made him a materalist ; he still believes in the soul as something above the flesh . Still doth the soul , from its lone fastness high , Upon our life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight as we will , we die ; And , while it lasts , we can not wholly end . Rugby Chapel , we see him standing by the grave of his father , a man of " radiant vigor " and of splendid faith . The contrast between father and son is as pathetic as it is significant . From thought of what the father was , the son draws- inspiration and courage and even something of faith . Yet after all , he knows full well that he must be sufficient unto himself . The sense of isolation is upon him , as well as the sense of lost faith . He cries in Marguerite : Yes ! in the sea of life enisled , With echoing straits between us thrown , Dotting the shoreless watery wild , We mortal millions live alone . The few lines that have been quoted would alone be sufficient to show the classical perfection of Arnold 's poetic style . He is a poet of limited range and product , his Poetry but almost all that he has written is worthy to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great lyric poet , although his exquisite art sometimes achieved most beautiful effects . Of his narrative poems , only one is a genuine success . In Sohrab and R , istnm , // however , his classic style is combined with a romantic story to fine poetic results . His true field is that of meditation and reflection rather than that of passionate heart utterance or of objective portrayal . There is passion in Arnold 's poetry , but it is rather a passion of the brain . Beyond the poems already mentioned , some of his finest work is to be found in The Strayed Reveller , in that beautiful piece of pure poetic fancy , The Forsaken Merman , and in his elegiac poems . Thyrsis , a monody on the death of his friend and fellow-poet , Arthur Hugh Clough , is one of the most beautiful elegies in the language ; and scarcely less noteworthy is its companion poem , The Scholar-Gypsy . Elizabeth Barrett Browning was a woman of fine intelligence and of broad culture ; but in almost all other respects she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is the intellect that speaks ; in hers , it is the heart . In all that he wrote , there is the classical refinement and finish that marks the presence of a fine critical faculty ; Mrs. Browning had the fire and the inspiration , but lacked more than anything else the power of self-criticism . In still more important matters there is the same apparent divergence . So far as we can see , Mrs. Browning was almost untouched by the scientific spirit of the age or by its religious struggle and doubt . Unlike George Eliot , she was thoroughly feminine in nature ; and her woman 's intuition found the spiritual where it could not be found by much intellectual searching . In an analytic and inquiring age , she was a creature of passion and impulse , a lover of romance and of the beauty of Italy and Greece . She was touched , however , by the democratic spirit , or rather by something that is or should be the fine flower of democracy ? the spirit of sweet human charity for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustration of this than The CTy of the Children , a poetic protest against the sacrifice of child life to // the modern spirit of industrialism . That she loved liberty , is written large in Casa Guidi Windows and in many other poems . Two main faults are charged against Mrs. Browning 's poetry . In the first place , it is said that she lacked definiteness in her conceptions and a clear and well-ordered arrangement of her material ? in other words , that she was somewhat vague and diffuse . In the second place , it is said that she was extremely careless in details of style and metre . These are important matters , and it is probable that in both cases the full justice of the criticism must be allowed . It can only be pleaded against them that they should not be given undue weight to the detriment of her poetic fame , and that they are more than offset by certain other qualities which she possessed in an eminent degree . In the first place , the whole tone and character of her thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression in poetry rather than in prose . It might even be said , more broadly , that her whole character and temper were poetic . She carried about her , so to say , a poetic atmosphere : This being true , poetry was to her a thoroughly natural mode of utterance ? less an art than an instinct ; and this may in some measure account for an ease which often amounted to carelessness . Such a nature would least feel the need of a discipline like that which made Pope and Tennyson such perfect poetic artists ; and that discipline was precisely what her spontaneous genius most needed . Perhaps her preeminent gift was poetic passion . It was poured out richly into such brief lyrics as The Cry of the Human , The House of Clouds , Cowper 's Grave , Catarina to Camoens , and A Musical Instrument ; it informed many a fine passage even in her long verse novel , Aurora Leigh ; it rang with a high and resonant note in her poems on Italian freedom and in Casa Guidi Windows ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Portuguese . Such poems as many of these illustrate , too , her fine gift of lyric music . She was a splendid singer , even if she was sometimes guilty of a false note . We must grant her also the larger endowment of poetic im agination . She could see , clearly and vividly , and she was able in large measure to " realize " her vision in outward forms . Among other poems that strikingly illustrate her imaginative power , may be named The Rhyme of the Duchess May and A Vision of Poets . These and all her poems illustrate the charm of poetic beauty that is everywhere in her work and that exalts it above all detraction . Mrs. Browning 's masterpiece , the work that best illustrates all her poetic powers , is her Sonnets from the Portuguese . It is a sonnet cycle , enshrining to a poetic immortality her love for Robert Browning . The title is a mere veil or fanciful disguise ; for the poems are all original , personal , and intimate . The whole number of sonnets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the progress of her passion . She records how love came to her as she stood expecting death , how she feared to look so high or to accept such bliss , how her love bade her rather prepare for renunciation , how she found her supreme joy at last in acceptance and in self-surrender . This is the next to the last of the sonnets : How do I love thee ? Let me count the ways . I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach , when feeling out of sight For the ends of being and ideal grace . I love thee to the level of every day 's Most quiet need , by sun and candle-light . I love thee freely , as men strive for right . I love thee purely , as they turn from praise . I love thee with the passion put to use In my old griefs , and with my childhood 's faith . I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints . I love thee with the breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , if God choose , I shall but love thee better after death . Of all the great men of literary genius in his time , Robert Browning was the strongest , the sanest , and the healthiest in body and in spirit . The man was alive in every fibre , and all his work is permeated with the vigor of his intense personality . His long and happy life was comparatively uneventful . Born in London , in 1812 , he was educated under the direction of his father and found later in foreign travel his substitute for a university training . There is ample evidence in his work that he was a man of rich learning and of broad culture . Aside from his literary achievements , the most interesting event of Browning 's life was his marriage with Elizabeth Barrett . Theirs is one of the most beautiful love stories in all literature , and it was crowned by a happy wedded life of fifteen years , in Florence . The death of Mrs. Browning in 1861 was the great , sorrow of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in England , but died in Venice in 1889 . Browning seems to have been comparatively unaffected by the great impulses of his age , either in the way of acceptance or of antagonism . It was not that he did not feel these influences ? at least in general and unconscious ways ; it was rather that he received them as a strong and steady and self-assured personality , not to be easily moved by any forces from his own place or direction . Science did not disturb his soul , and he was perfectly willing to accept all of its established conclusions ; but he was also perfectly aware of the questions that it was raising , and met them with an assured faith and optimism . His analytical habit was in entire harmony with the spirit of science , and so was his unhesitating willingness to look all truth in the face . But he received its message as a poet and as a man of faith , // and was unshaken either in his poetic ideals or in his religious assurance . While he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he did not speak for human freedom or make himself the mouthpiece of " the people " ? he was nevertheless democratic in the broadest sense . Nothing human was alien to him , all men were his spiritual brothers , all personalities appealed to his catholic interest and sympathy . He cared little for actual political conditions , as he cared little for general laws or principles . What he cared for above all was the individual human soul , and in that field his interest was as broad as it was profound . There was probably the real basis of his unshaken faith . If science found in its study of the natural world no evidence of spirit , and felt itself driven toward materialism , Browning , on the other hand , found in his study of human personality full reason to believe in the soul , in God , and in immortality . What others could not find in the physical facts or laws of the universe , he found in the essential nature of man . His faith and optimism , therefore , were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well-grounded conviction . In this spirit , he spoke with assurance , with earnestness , with exultation , but in no temper of controversy or antagonism . In Rabbi Ben Ezra , he expresses himself thus : Fool ! All that is , at all , Lasts ever , past recall ; Earth changes , but thy soul and God stand sure . It is one of the peculiar glories of Browning that he seems , almost from the first , to have caught as by a sort of intuition the spirit and teaching of his own generation , to have accepted its permanent gains , and then to have passed on beyond its doubts and fears to be the prophet of a new day when men should see with vision unclouded by the smoke and dust of conflict . Browning was , of course , a poet with a message . While // he was primarily a great student and portrayer of life rather than a teacher , he understood well that life teaches and endeavored to interpret its meaning . We may properly speak of his teaching as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all the points involved in e that philosophy would be to discuss most of his poetry . We can only attempt to blaze a way through the forest ? or , as the dramatic and human quality of Browning 's poetry might rather suggest , to push a way through the crowd ? indicating some of the main points of his thinking , leaving much to be inferred or imagined . Beginning on the lower levels of his thought , Browning was emphatically a poet who dealt with the physical life of man , who felt " the value and significance of flesh . " He was a man with all his senses keenly alive . His appreciation of the physical life , however , was something more than mere sensuousness of temperament . It was reasoned doctrine . It was not a physical life of luxurious enjoyment that Browning exalted , but one of strenuous endeavor . In Rabbi Ben Ezra , he urges : Strive , and hold cheap the strain ; Learn , nor account the pang ; dare , never grudge the throe ! Strive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Browning 's philosophy of life . Browning was , of course , something vastly more than the poet of the merely physical life , even in its highest and best manifestations . He was also , as Alfred Domett called him , the " Subtlest Assertor of the Soul The Soul in Song . " He taught that soul and body may be mutually helpful in their union , that the body may serve to " project the soul on its lone way . " He taught , on the other hand , that the soul has its own aims and powers , and may , in the development of its higher functions , sometimes find the body a hindrance as well as a help . This and // much more is finely expressed in a notable passage from Paracelsus : Truth is within ourselves ; it takes no rise From outward things , whate'er you may believe . There is an inmost centre in us all , Where truth abides in fulness ; and around , Wall upon wall , the gross flesh hems it in , This perfect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perverting carnal mesh Binds it , and makes all error : and to KNOW Rather consists in opening out a way Whence the imprisoned splendour may escape , Than in effecting entry for a light Supposed to be without . This is not exactly the doctrine of modern realism in art and literature , any more than it is exactly the teaching of modern science . It is at least a splendid poetic conception of man as the possessor of a living soul , out of which are the issues of life . One of Browning 's favorite doctrines was that the unloosing of this " imprisoned splendour " is achieved mainly through the contact of the soul with higher personalities , and ultimately with the divine personality . God may influence the soul through nature as well as through human personalities . Sometimes the soul may feel the direct and immediate touch of the divine personality , without any intervention of nature or of other human souls . In any case , here is the soul , with its innate powers , to be elicited by whatever means ? not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human or divine , but an " imprisoned splendour , " to be let loose for a light to men . To Browning , the great fact of our merely human life was the fact of man and woman ? on the physical side , the fact of sex ? on the soul side , the fact of spiritual difference and correspondence . Therefore he magnified and glorified human love . He makes the Gypsy Queen in The Flight of the Duchess sing How love is the only good in the world . // Even to the unrequited lover , love is good , as he has shown in that magnificent love-song , The Last Ride Together . Every reader of Browning knows what passionate intensity he has put into his portrayal of love . Pippa Passes , In a Balcony , In a Gondola , these but afford some of the finest among many illustrations . Not out of his imagination alone did Browning write such love poetry as this . His own being had throbbed with the love that he describes ; and dramatic poet as he is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own heart . How exalted was his personal affection , how infinitely more than merely sensuous was his poetic treatment of human love , we may learn from all his poetry . We may learn also that his conception of love has a more than human range . As on the lower levels he saw the great fact of man and woman and exalted human love , so to him the great fact of the spiritual life was God and man , and he exalted spiritual love . God 's love to us , our love to Him ? this is the foundation and the ultimate reward of all faith . This is especially the great teaching of Saul and A Death in the Desert , as well as of other poems . Browning was first of all the poet of man ? of man physical and man spiritual . He was also a poet vitally interested in man 's relation to the world around him ? primarily , of course , in his relation to the visible world . Here Browning was met by the problems that modern science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the weight and pressure of those problems . There was no revolt against science , but rather a frank and cordial acceptance of its demonstrated conclusions , with due recognition , however , of scientific limitations and with due protest against its unwarranted assumptions . He perceived the difficulties which science had placed in the way of faith , but here , again , he had no controTHE // versy with true science . In Bishop Blougram 's Apology , he makes the Bishop speak of Cosmogony , Geology , ethnology , what not ( Greek endings , each the little passing-bell That signifies some faith 's about to die ) . Not for him , however , was science the passing-bell of faith . He was probably uttering somewhat of his own thought when he made Bishop Blougram say further : With me faith means perpetual unbelief Kept quiet like the snake ' neath Michael 's foot , Who stands firm just because he feels him writhe . Against all doubt , Browning preserved the full assurance that there is a world invisible as well as a world visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ral ? and that man is living always in vital world relation to both . That God is , and that he is all-beneficent ? in this supreme assurance , despite all temptation to believe otherwise , Browning lived and wrote . God is not altogether such as we are , though different minds will shadow forth conceptions of him determined by their own natures and capacities . In Caliban upon Setebos , the half beast Caliban sprawls " flat on his belly in the pit 's much mire , " " kicks both feet in the cool slush , " and meditates upon " that other , whom his dam called God . " How " heaven-high removed " from his conception is that of David as he sings before the stricken king in Saul , or that of the dying apostle in A Death in the Desert : If Christ , as thou affirmest , be of men Mere man , the first and best but nothing more ,  - -  Account Him , for reward of what He was , Now and forever , wretchedest of all . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost ! // It is the test of death that puts all human theories to the proof . Neither Browning nor we can look beyond it to The Test of know what it shall bring ; but it is at least sigDeath nificant to know how the great poet contemplated for himself the supreme change . He taught that man is spirit and immortal , that God is and loves , that death is but the doorway to an infinite progress of life beyond . Was his doctrine an actual stay to his own soul ? Did he himself face the thought of death " fearless and unperplexed " ? Two of his briefer poems help to give us the answer . The first is Prospice , written in the noontide of his own life , but just after the death of his wife . The other is the Epilogue to Asolando . It is the last poem of his last volume . As he read it over in its first printed form just before his departure , he said : " It almost looks like bragging to say this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the simple truth ; and as it 's true it shall stand . " He looked on the face of death with the same bold and confident spirit that had made him one of the great masters of life . Here was a great man , strong and subtle in mind , steadfast and confident in soul . Here was also a great poet , able to bring the resources of the poet 's art into the service of a splendid intelligence . To him , more than to most men , poetry was an instrument of truth . As he himself says , in The Ring and the Book , Art remains the one way possible Of speaking truth , to mouths like mine at least . This truth he expresses through an objective and dramatic portrayal of life . He describes his own work as " poetry always dramatic in principle , the utterances of so many imaginary personages , not mine . " We seldom hear his own direct voice , but ever the voices of the men and women whom his imagination has created . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and now . They are bodies , with all the powers and passions and weaknesses of the flesh ; they are souls , with all their infinite possibilities of joy or sorrow , of purity or degradation . They are living and acting in the midst of a real and visible world , but they are surrounded by a world invisible and spiritual . To illustrate Browning 's portrayal of real men and women in the midst of their actual environment , we have only to open his volume at random and read ; for this is the task of all his poetry . Browning 's favorite art form ? a form that he made peculiarly his own ? is the dramatic monologue . In principle , it is a type of poem in which the words are Dramatic uttered by an imaginary speaker , who reveals his character , his attitude , his situation , and perhaps throws some light upon other persons of whom or to whom he speaks . His marvelous insight into the human soul and his no less marvelous power of imaginative conception enable Browning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are in reality several different types of dramatic monologue , the distinction between which is important . There are first " Dramatic Lyrics " ? like Old Pictures in Florence , Saul , Abt Vogler , and Rabbi Ben Ezra ? in which the chief stress is laid upon an emotional state , and in which Browning displays a wonderful gift of pure lyric music . Then there are " Dramatic Romances " ? like The Flight of the Duchess , In a Gondola , and Childe Roland ? in which character is associated with a romantic story . Again , there are " Dramatic Idyls " ? like Pheidippides , Ned Bratts , and Clive ? in which character is thrown out against the background of a vivid picture . Browning does not always clearly discriminate all these from the dramatic monologue proper ? illustrated by Andrea del Sarto , Fra Lipp Lipp ' , and Cleon ? but he seems to have had the several types in // mind . In the lyric and the monologue proper , the speaker is more likely to be unfolding himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the romance and the idyl , he is more likely to be unfolding the character of another . Browning 's great masterpiece is The Ring and the Book . It is an immense work , and practically consists of a seriesof extended dramatic monologues . In the first the Book and last of the twelve books , he sets forth the pathetic story of Pompilia , a Roman girl murdered by her brutal husband , Count Guido . In each of the other ten , the case is reviewed by some more or less interested person , and we are led to see how the same simple facts make their varied impression upon different types of mind . The characters of Guido , Pompilia , Caponsacchi the noble priest , and the good Pope are magnificent creations ; and the whole work is a splendid exhibition of imaginative and poetic power . It remains to be observed that Browning attempted some work in the formal drama . In spite of his great dramatic genius , he was comparatively unsuc- cessful . His power lay rather in illustrating critical moments in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of active life upon the stage . He was psychological and inward in his dealings with character . and showed too little the effective deeds of men . The abstruseness of his thought and the difficulties of his style were not favorable to stage presentation . In spite of these and other drawbacks , however , some of his dramas are in their way most striking productions . There , as always , he is the profound revealer of man 's inner life . Probably his most effective play on the stage is A Blot in the'Scutcheon , but Strafford has also been fairly successful . One of his finest masterpieces , Pippa Passes , is hardly to be called a drama at all . It lies rather between the true // drama and the monologue . One of his earliest works , it still remains one of the most beautiful and perfect . Not even in portraying the little silk-winding girl , whose simple life unconsciously touches those of the four greatest and supposedly happiest souls in her native Asolo , can Browning hold himself quite aloof from his creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forgetting himself in the beings he has made , he is at least the subtle interpreter of life and the soul . Alfred Tennyson , the son of a cultured country clergyman , was born in 1809 , at Somersby , in Lincolnshire . All his surroundings tended to develop in him the love for nature , the spirit of conservatism , and the refined culture which were so strongly marked in his character . His poetical career began while he was a member of Trinity College , Cambridge , and here , too , he formed some of the great friendships of his life . Closest of all to his heart was Arthur Henry Hallam , with whom he was a member of a famous group known as " the twelve apostles . " Hallam 's death in 1833 plunged him into profound sorrow , and led to the writing of his great masterpiece , In Memoriam . This poem was published in 185o , and the same year is marked by his marriage and by his appointment as poet-laureate . Tennyson 's long life was lived in poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly to his conviction that the poet should watch the spectacle of life from his calm height with sympathetic interest , but should not engage in its activities . Until his death in 1892 , he wrought out calmly and strongly his self-appointed tasks , unswerved by praise or blame . Fame came to him in ample measure , but better than fame was his ever widening influence for good in literature and in life . His elevation to the peerage , in 1884 , with the title of Baron of Aldworth and Farringford , was a recognition of his unique place among the poets of his generation . // Tennyson , if not absolutely the greatest , was at least the most representative poet of his age . He was sensitive to all its influences , reflected all its movements , and felt a poet 's sympathy with the various phases of its life . He may be said to have walked shoulder to shoulder with his time , in the first rank , but hardly a step before or a step behind . His art recognized and accepted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagery and of his deepest thought was drawn from scientific sources . Above all , he accepted the scientific doctrine of evolution , and helped to reconcile that doctrine with spiritual faith . He felt and voiced the prevailing doubt and sadness of his generation . The struggle in his soul was long and bitter . His nature would not allow him the easy victory and the confident faith of Browning , but neither was he left to the cold and stoical resignation of Arnold . He was able at last to say : Not in vain , Like Paul with beasts , I fought with death . The problems most interesting to him were those which concern the development and destiny of mankind . His poetry expresses the abiding faith of man , unconquerable by temporary doubts and fears . Tennyson was also in sympathy with what is best in modern democracy , although he felt its dangers and shrank from its excesses . His artistic sympathy is displayed in his various portrayals of lowly characters and humble life , from Enoch Arden to The Northern Farmer . The democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England because it is The land , where girt with friends or foes A man may speak the thing he will ; . . . Where Freedom slowly broadens down From precedent to precedent . " The red fool-fury of the Seine , " " the blind hysterics of // the Celt , " was repellent to his nature . The freedom that he loved was a democratic freedom ; but it was " freedom in her regal seat of England , " freedom regulated by law . In still other ways , he was thoroughly representative both of his age and his country . He was typical of the culture , the refinement , and the intellectual freedom of his time . His patriotism , his conservatism , his love of liberty , were in harmony with the underlying sentiment of the England of Victoria . More than any other English poet , he had an instinctive perception of the essential character of the age . More than any other , he was fitted to express its manifold life and thought . Tennyson 's poetic genius may best be defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand at opposite poles of poetry and of life . If we should attempt to condense this contrast into abriefest terms , we might characterize the two as respectively artist and thinker . These words do not tell us everything ; but they suggest what is central in each . Browning has much of the artist 's temperament and skill ; but above all other things , he is a thinker expressing truth in imaginative forms . Tennyson is gifted with a master 's strength and fineness of thought ; but he is preeminently an artist in language . This fundamental difference between the two men appears at every point and manifests itself in a great variety of ways . Tennyson was essentially a poetic artist . This means , first of all , that he was endowed with that exquisite sense of beauty which lies at the very heart of the sense of poet 's nature . With his own Lotos-Eaters , he can feel the seductive charm of that enchanted land In which it seemed always afternoon . He confesses to us that he is one Whose spirits falter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Yet this sense of beauty in him is exalted by the spirit of an intense and lofty ideality . He is thrilled by the beauty of that immortal courage which sent the Light Brigade " into the mouth of Hell " at Balaklava . He feels through all his soul the beauty of Arthur 's royal manhood and of Galahad 's stainless chivalry . He adds a whiteness to the virgin snow in his picture of St. Agnes , the bride of Christ , who cries : Break up the heavens , 0 Lord ! and far , Thro ' all yon starlight keen , Draw me , thy bride , a glittering star , In raiment white and clean . Tennyson possessed also in fulness of measure that other essential gift of the poet ? imagination . The clearness and picturesqueness of his conceptions is beyond praise . They are as lucid as the morning , as distinct and vivid as noonday shadows . Yet withal , this imagination can carry us out into the realms of spiritual suggestion which lie beyond all earthly images . What could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more suggestive than such words as these : A still salt pool , lock 'd in with bars of sand ; Left on the shore ; that hears all night The plunging seas draw backward from the land Their moon-led waters white . He possessed also that breadth of imagination which some have been inclined to deny him . Surely there is range between The Miller 's Daughter and The Lady of Shalott , between Enoch Arden and The Idylls of the King . It has been sometimes said that he is lacking in the poet 's passion . Yet surely this , too , is a mistake . He has not the vehement emotion of a Byron or aBurns ; his is rather the full , deep stream of Wordsworth which flows with none the less power because it is broad and still . That he is a master of pathos , who // can doubt that has read Guinevere or Enoch Arden or In Memoriam ? That he is full of manly vigor and of patriotic fervor , we may feel in his war-songs , in the Ode on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ballad of The Revenge . That he can portray the passion of love , is manifest beyond all question in The Princess and Maud . The latter rises even to that vehement intensity so impressive to the common mind . Its opening line strikes the passion note of the poem : I hate the dreadful hollow behind the little wood . Still other and stranger notes are struck in such poems as The Two Voices and Ri ; pah . Yes , he is a poet whose passion has fulness , depth , range , and at times intensity . What to some critics seems like a limitation , but what to the great sound heart of humanity will always seem a part of his highest glory , is the fact that the whole strength of his emotion is directed toward the good and true and against the false and base . Poetry to him was no mere toy or luxury , but one of the great forces of life . It has its immortal delight , but it has also its eternal duty . Both sides of his conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mission : The poet in a golden clime was born , With golden stars above ; Dower 'd with the hate of hate , the scorn of scorn , The love of love . It is difficult to speak in measured terms of Tennyson as a master of form . In nearly all his work there is a most exquisite perception of the harmony between thought and language . He had a wonderful ear for the music of verse , a wonderful eye for artistic effects of form and color . Hardly any poet is his superior in ease and versatility of style . Not alone in details was he a perfect master of his art ; he possessed also that // fine sense of unity and proportion which can build up great and elaborate masterpieces . Tennyson was a poet born ; but he was also a poet made . No man ever set himself more deliberately and persistently to self-culture in the technique of poetic art . He made himself so perfect a craftsman that , when his passion began to grow and his experience of life to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of a trained singer . So flawless is his work , even when he is most profoundly stirred , that in any other man such perfection would have savored of affectation and insincerity . The evidences of this perfect art are everywhere in his poetry ? almost in every line that he has written . Who can forget the enchanted music of The Lady of Shalott or the luxurious cadences of The Lotos-Eaters ? The songs of The Princess ring in our ears with echoes as from The horns of Elfland faintly blowing . Now it is the song of The Brook : I slip , I slide , I gloom , I glance , Among my skimming swallows ; I make the netted sunbeam dance Against my sandy shallows . I murmur under moon and stars In brambly wildernesses ; I linger by my shingly bars ; I loiter round my cresses . Now it is the sublime lamentation for Wellington : Bury the Great Duke With an empire 's lamentation , Let us bury the Great Duke To the noise of the mourning of a mighty nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and now the description of that " last weird battle in the west " where Arthur falls with all his chivalry : So all day long the noise of battle rolled Among the mountains by the winter sea . // The Idylls of the King remind us that Tennyson was a romantic poet ; but he was not forgetful of real life , as we may see in Dora and The Miller 's Daughter and in many another poem . We are reminded also that his genius was largely idyllic ? that it delighted in the purely picturesque . His lyric poetry is not less perfect ; and it is perhaps in some of his shorter lyrics that we find the distilled essence of his poetic genius . In the drama he displays great powers and great limitations . We may be sure that his best work does not lie there ; for neither he nor his age possessed in large measure the dramatic spirit . If he had given us only his dramas , we might cherish them as among our dearest treasures ; but he has elsewhere given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was divided between nature and humanity . He was not exclusively the poet of one or the other . What is more typical of him is that he was everywhere the poet of culture and morality . No poetry is more truly refined ; no poetry makes more for essential righteousness . And what a devotion to his art and to all that it implies . He takes himself seriously as a poet , if ever a man did ; he lives the part to perfection . We shall not easily discover him " without his singing robes and garland on . " He dies with his finger between the pages of Shakespeare 's Cymbeline at the song ending with words that might have been his own epitaph : Quiet consummation have ; And renowned be thy grave ! Much of Tennyson 's poetry stands simply for his enthusiastic interest in his poetic art and illustrates his conception of the significance of that art . Manyof his earliest poems are simply exquisitely beautiful poetical exercises , without other significance than their melody and sensuous charm . Others , like The Poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poet 's place // and mission . The Lady of Shalott symbolizes allegorically the artist 's aloofness from the world , taking no part in its activities , but reflecting it with loving sympathy in the magic mirror of the imagination and weaving the vision into the magic web of poetry . The Palace of Art shows the curse that falls on the beauty-loving soul that cuts itself off utterly from its kind and shuts itself up to its own selfish enjoyment . Such poems are symbolical of one side of Tennyson 's nature . Their spirit does not die out of his poetry , even to the end , but his genius becomes ever deeper and broader . Somewhat akin to such works as these , at least in their inspiration , are his poems on classical themes ? finely conceived and wonderfully executed specimens of poetic workmanship . ( Enone , The LotosEaters , Lucretius , Tithonus , are all admirable in their diverse ways ; but his masterpiece in this kind is Ulysses . Chaste in style , felicitous in expression , noble in conception , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this classical taste , and serving to illustrate the poet 's increasing breadth , are his poems dealing with common English life . Among the earliest of these are The Miller 's Daughter and Dora . The finest example of all is his famous and popular Enoch Arden . Later came his interesting dialect studies , like The Northern Farmer and The Northern Cobbler . These indicate an interest in common life and also a patriotic spirit which is still further illustrated by specifically patriotic poems like The Charge of the Light Brigade , The Revenge , and the Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington . Other phases of his genius must be illustrated by some of his longer poems and by the poems written toward the close of his life . The Princess is a fanciful poem which Tennyson properly called a medley . It deals with the modern woman question under the guise of a fantastic story about the foundTHE // ing - of a woman 's college and the breaking up of the scheme through certain love intrigues . The poem is not altogether a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagery and interspersed with some of his most exquisite lyrics . It is interesting as showing Tennyson 's growing disposition to consider the serious problems of his time . Somewhat the same may be said of Maud , one of the most peculiar of his poems . It is a poem of passionate love , madness , and despair , gloomy but splendid . Its finer quality is marred by a tone of almost pessimistic satire against the baser spirit of the age . In Memoriam is a great elegy , inspired by the early death of Tennyson 's intimate and beloved friend Arthur Hallam . Simply in its character as an elegy , it is a marvelous poem , passionate with a heart-breaking sorrow , and rich with all the powers of expression of a great poet . It is vastly more , however , than a simple elegy ; it is the great poetic record of Tennyson 's spiritual struggle with the demons of doubt and despair . Through a long series of lyrics bound together by their association with the one central theme , we may trace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grapple with the sternest problems of human existence . The real theme of the poem is the immortality of the soul ; and the poet 's final victory is based on the passionate conviction that such a love as his is and must be immortal . If the pure reason can give him no satisfaction , he hears at least the answer of the heart . If e'er when faith had fall'n asleep , I heard a voice " believe no more " And heard an ever-breaking shore That tumbled in the Godless deep ; A warmth within the breast would melt The freezing reason 's colder part , // And like a man in wrath the heart Stood up and answer 'd " I have felt . " He concludes his " high argument " with an expression of faith in That God , which ever lives and loves , One God , one law , one element , And one far-off divine event , To which the whole creation moves . In the Idylls of the King , Tennyson deals as a true romantic poet with the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English literature , but never more beautifully than here . The " Idylls " are a series of twelve picturesque narratives , written independently at different times in Tennyson 's career and later combined into a single great work . In his hands , the old medieval legends are modernized into a great spiritual parable . We see Arthur , the noble guide and leader of men , coming to his kingdom ; we see that kingdom growing in beauty and power under his mild and wise sway ; we see everything brought to moral ruin by the sin of Lancelot and Guinevere ; we see Arthur finally overthrown in his " last weird battle in the west " and passing to his place among the dead . It is the failure of spiritual dominion in a world too gross for such high ideals . The meaning of the great and beautiful poem can not be better expressed than in Tennyson 's own words , when he calls it This old imperfect tale , New-old , and shadowing Sense at war with Soul . In his later life , Tennyson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showed a disposition to draw still closer to real life and to its profounder problems . He wrote his great dramas , beginning with Queen Mary , and including such noble works as Harold and Becket . While ; they were not altogether successful as acting plays , they are finely poetical and show genuine // insight into life and character . Some of his later poems are rather gloomy in tone , impressing us with a sense of failure and disillusion concerning the great movements of the age and concerning human progress . Yet toward the last comes a high and serene mood of faith in that supreme power which is guiding " the whole creation " toward the " one far-off divine event , " and which holds all individual souls in the hollow of his hand . In The Making of Man , he says : Man as yet is being made , and ere the crowning Age of ages , Shall not aeon after m on pass and touch him into shape ? In Faith , he cries : Doubt no longer that the Highest is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sings : Call me rather , silent voices , Forward to the starry track Glimmering up the heights beyond me On , and always on ! Crossing the Far , one of the most beautiful poems that he ever wrote , closes with this splendid expression of personal faith and courage : For tho ' from out our bourne of Time and Place The flood may bear me far , I hope to see my Pilot face to face When I have crost the bar . CHAPTER XVIII THE NEW AGE ( 1892-1924 ) Tim tale of a great literature is never complete ; it is always " to be continued . " A few years pass , and we find ourselves in the midst of a new age , with new life and new influences and new movements and new outlook . An old century has passed away and a new century has dawned . Here are new men and new aims and new spirit and new literary creations . To interpret the age in which we ourselves are living is a difficult if not an impossible task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of a bold guess which may hit the truth rather by happy chance than by superior insight . We can make our own conjecture , but the future may have something very different to say . The age just past was an age of democracy and science . So much still seems fairly clear . It seems clear also that these are no longer the wellsprings of our thought , the inspirations of our deeper life . They are still with us and they will continue to exert a profound influence upon mankind , but they have led us on to think of something beyond themselves . We see that they do not give us the last word on human progress . Science has opened up to us new regions of knowledge ; but we are interested now to know what this new knowledge can do for us and what it will do with us . Democracy has opened new doors of freedom and opportunity ; we are questioning now as to the uses and effects of popular government and looking for the next step forward . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of many new movements . There was mani-408 // fest everywhere a new spirit . It was a time of restlessness and desire for change . Men did not know quite where they wanted to go , but they felt that they were on their way and were bent on going by a different road . It now begins to appear as though the age was being moved chiefly by social interest and social ideas . First it was an enthusiasm for the social millenium , for the " next New Jerusalem . " Then there came something of disillusion and a good deal of mocking irony , but still a persistent interest in social questions . In a word , the age is characterized by social self-consciousness and a growing sense of l social responsibility . It is interested in social problems , it cherishes social ideals , it challenges existing institutions , it looks toward the goal of human welfare . It is still interested in scientific theory and discovery , but it asks what science can really do for the material and moral betterment of mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether democracy can endure and develop unless the world can breed a better type of men , and it asks further how far democracy can be the servant of this higher good . So far , this social spirit has been mainly negative and critical rather than positive and constructive . It has manifested itself first as a revolt against the age that preceded and against most of the things that that age represents . All things Victorian ? social life , politics , business , education , art , architecture , literature , even morality ? are hopelessly " middle-class , " and the last word of condemnation is " mid-Victorian . " Partly this is the instinctive revolt that takes place in every generation . What the fathers have done is not likely to seem good to the sons . What the grandfathers have done has a better chance of seeming good to the grandsons . Each generation holds the previous one responsible for Oro THE NEW AGE ( 1892-1924 ) whatever seems just then to be wrong with the world and believes that itself has found at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it grows older and then it comes to have more respect for the immediate past . The preceding age comes back to something of its own . There can be little doubt that this will happen with reference to the Victorian age , and there are already signs of the reaction . There were in that age ? and especially in its literature ? so many elements of real greatness that it must be regarded as one of the outstanding periods in the development of the historic life of the English people . The revolt against it , however , was not altogether a superficial one . In part it was a revolt against that spirit of smugness and convention which is so stiffing to the highest intellectual activity and the highest spiritual aspiration . In part it was a deep-seated conviction that the time had come at last to challenge some of the social wrongs grown hoary with age and tolerance . So far , the revolt was facing the future and not the past and was full of hope and promise . If it has remained largely negative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it challenged and how much the public needed to be enlightened as to the real nature of those evils . The public must be enlightened also as to what should be done and how . When this educational process is over , there may come a positive phase in which the public shall be led by men of genius who are also seers and prophets . Our survey of the literature of the period will in some measure put to the test the view that this age has been chiefly influenced by the social spirit . Our first concern , however , is with the writers themselves and with the works which they have produced . The difficulties of such a survey are many . The most
