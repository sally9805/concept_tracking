Since building operations commenced , about two years ago , on the estate of the late James Gordon Bennett , these trees , the finest collection in New York City , have suffered heavy casualties , shattered and barked by dynamite and heavy trucks , but few have fallen out of line , and this year have again gladdened the eye of thousands who have coursed under their verdant arch . It has fallen to the city itself , however , to actually lay the axe to their roots ! A trench , five or six feet deep extending many blocks , has been dug and blasted within two feet of these trees , cutting off at least onethird of their roots and depriving them of their life arteries just when the sap is on the downward trend !

Such trees can not be grown in a year , and it is they , not the humans , or their buildings , that make the city beautiful . HENRY WARWICK . Nov , York . Sept. 8 , 1923.
