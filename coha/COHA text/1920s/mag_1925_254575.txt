Herewith are excerpts from letters come to the desks of the editors during the past week . They are selected primarily for the information they contain cither supplementary to , or corrective of , news previously published in TIME . <P> " Mighty Achievement " <P> TIME Albany , N. Y. <P> New York , N. Y. July 11 , 1925 <P> Sirs : <P> I have just finished reading the derogatory , fault-finding letters of several of your self-styled " charter subscribers . " They have roused my ire-me , a mere newcomer to the ranks of TIME readers . I feel it my duty to mount the rostrum of Free Speech , to defend TIME , once more to proclaim the independence of the Press-its inalienable right to be frank with its readers and itself . Truth is the only legitimate censor of the Public Press . Errors ( not lies ) find their way into the printed page as they do in the spoken word . In speech , they are excused as " slips of the tongue " ; in print , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two standards ? TIME is to be patted upon the back for printing the letters of its readers pointing out its errors ; it is to be more heavily patted for not trying to excuse its faults as " typographical errors " or the result of " conditions over which it exerted no control , " as the average Press so often does . <P> TIME is frank with itself ; TIME is likewise frank with its readers . Frankness breeds discontent at times ; discontent brings complaint , sometimes valid , more often invalid . TIME , in its unique way , says things at times that hit home with a bang-its criticisms are harsh - its adjectives ever are pointed as daggers- it portrays the world a bit cynically yet interestingly-it sees good in some , bad in others , worse in a few , and in so doing pacifies the thinker and makes the gullible thing . That is a mighty achievement ; certainly it should overshadow the minor errors that too often arouse petty sentimentalists to complaint . <P> Keep up the good work , TIME ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WALKER. * <P> Official Title <P> TIME Franklin , Mass . New York , N. Y. July 13 , 1925 Sirs : <P> In TIME , July 6 , Page 18 , in a footnote you say the official title of the Roman Catholic Church is " Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church . " This would be quite correct and altogether true but for the omission of one most significant and necessary word . That word is Roman . The official title then of the Roman Church is " The Holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church . " <P> Authority : A Manual of Prayers For Use of the Catholic Laity , P. 413,415 , John Murphy Co. , Baltimore , Md. , 1889 . Will you please make this correction for the truth 's sake ? <P> CHAS . F. WESTMAN <P> ( Original Subscriber ) <P> P. S. " Easter Saturday , " Page 18 , col. 2 , should be " Easter Even " or " Holy Saturday . " There is no such day as " Easter Saturday . " <P> TIME believes that if Original Subscriber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find that the manual was technically incorrect and that TIME was correct. - ED . <P> Howie Scored <P> TIME Coronado , Calif . <P> New York , N. Y. June 30 , 1925 <P> Sirs :
