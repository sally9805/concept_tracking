A sitting-room which is also the dining-room of a flat in that part of New York known as Harlem . It is the late afternoon of an autumn day . JANET , a little girl , nine years old , very conscious of her new frock , is moving about a table which has been set for three . Her place is designated by a chair higher than the others . She is gravely interested and pleased because of the unusual state with which it has been arranged . She fingers the pink shades on the four candlesticks and touches the little roses in the low bowl . A buzzer rings . She races to the wall to answer it through a speaking-tube , shouting down to someone at the door , outside . JANET Hello . Hello . . . . What do you want ? . . . This is me . . . . What ? . . . Yes , I 'm Janet . Who are you ? Her voices takes on a warmer note . Oh , Mr. Greenough ! No  --  mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and Mrs. Price , but mother 's coming right back . . . . Oh , please , please , please come up ! A young , rather pretty woman of a common type opens the swinging door from the kitchen and hangs half-way around it , listening . JANET continues . No , you wo n't be in the way , at all . I 'm pressing the button  --  now try . She clicks the button that opens the door below and waits. p. 3 MRS . PRICE Good gracious  --  who 's that ? The ice cream ? JANET Through the tube to the person below . Try again . . . . Now . . . all right . She clicks the button again and again and then waits and turns to MRS . PRICE in delight . It 's Mr. Greenough ! It 's Mr. Greenough ! It 's Mr. Greenough ! I let him in . I let him in . MRS . PRICE Mr. Greenough ! Be still  --  child  --  stop your noise and your dancing about  --  and tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to show him the candles and the flowers and the new window curtains ! She has raced to the door at the back and opened it ; beyond is a narrow hall with a gas-jet burning on the other side . JANET stands outside the door looking down , singing . He 's coming , coming , coming up the stairs  --  MRS . PRICE Following her and bringing her back into the room by a firm grasp on her shoulder . Hush ! ' Sh ! Do n't yell like that . Your mamma would n't want such goings-on before Mr. Greenough ! She shakes her into sobriety . Besides , Mr. Greenough do n't care about the candles and the flowers . He has such things on his table every night . And you ca n't expect other people to be as excited as you are just because your papa 's coming home . p. 4 JANET Oh , but he 's coming so far , Mrs. Price ! All the way from Paris  --  clear across the ocean . And besides it 's his birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices are heard from the stairs outside . JANET hushes and both she and MRS . PRICE listen attentively . Suddenly . That 's him ! MRS . PRICE Listening . He 's got somebody with him . Gracious , I 'm a sight ! She catches a glimpse of herself in a mirror , then runs into the next room , already fingering her hair as two young men arrive at the open door . JANET Flashing toward them , but stopping short , suddenly shy . Come in . They do so , a little amused . They are obviously not the sort of young men one meets in Harlem flats . WALTER GREENOUGH looks as if he might be romantic . THEODORE STEWART does n't . But both give an instant impression of breeding and experience in the large world . GREENOUGH has a long box of flowers under one arm and another package under the other . STEWART is carrying a paper-wrapped basket . GREENOUGH Hello . He leads the way inside and indicates JANET . This is Miss Fields , Ned  --  Miss Janet Fields . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . May I introduce a cousin of mine  --  ? Mr. Theodore Stewart . He 's very anxious to know you , Miss Fields . p. 5 STEWART Gravely to the embarrassed but delighted child . How do you do , Miss Janet Fields  --  May I call you Janet ? It 's a nice name  --  and you must n't mind . I call everybody Janet the minute I meet them . JANET Gravely still . Hello . There is just the barest pause while the men glance at each other . Then she continues quickly . Mother 's not home . GREENOUGH So you told me  --  but you 'll let us wait , wo n't you ? JANET Sure . . . . Wo n't you sit down ? STEWART Perhaps this is a fitting moment to present Miss Fields with a certain small token of admiration . . . ? GREENOUGH Presenting a large box to JANET . For once , Monsieur Stewart , I consider your well-known habit of giving advice inoffensive . Here 's something for a good girl , Miss Janet Fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it chocolates ? GREENOUGH I was assured that it was chocolates , and I hope that there are enough to give you a fairly satisfactory pain in your tum-tum. p. 6 JANET Oh ! She does n't know whether to open it or not  --  but proceeds to do so . Oh ! Have some ? GREENOUGH Thank you , no . But do n't mind us . Open it and spoil your dinner if you wish . JANET Putting the box on the table and glancing at it . No , I do n't think mother would like that . We 're going to have such a good dinner . She pauses as they laugh , and then continues politely . If mother thinks there 's enough to go around maybe she 'll ask you to stay . Father 's coming home . GREENOUGH So I heard , and thanks very much , but we could n't possibly intrude . STEWART Yes , I 'm afraid we 'd be very much in the way tonight  --  even if there should be enough dinner to go around . If you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole year I would n't want anyone but you  --  and your mother , of course  --  at our first party after I came home . STEWART glances at GREENOUGH as he finishes , as if suddenly a little suspicious of his cousin 's real interest in this household . GREENOUGH Rather quickly . And by the way , Janet , here 's some fruit for your mother . p. 7 JANET Eyeing the long box also . Oh , thank you . And more flowers ? GREENOUGH Yes  --  but they will keep  --  He puts the box aside , on a table . However , there 's something here that we might put on the ice  --  something that usually makes a party just a bit more  --  of a party . He has taken the paper off the basket , pushed the fruit aside , and taken out three quart-bottles of champagne . JANET Oh  --  Cider ! GREENOUGH We 'll call it that  --  STEWART What 's in a name , anyway , these days ? GREENOUGH And do you think we can put these on ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do it . GREENOUGH We 'll help you . JANET Oh , no . Mrs. Price will . She 's in the kitchen watching the dinner for mother . She takes one of the bottles and starts to take another . STEWART Careful  --  one at a time , Miss . That cider 's precious stuff . p. 8 JANET I wo n't drop it . She backs through the swinging door . STEWART looks at GREENOUGH quizzically . GREENOUGH Well ? What 's on your mind ? STEWART Only that you 're very much at home round here . GREENOUGH Does it really seem like that to you ? And there 's not a place in the world where I mind my P 's and Q 's so carefully  --  Or where I feel more in the way . Nice little thing , is n't she  --  ? STEWART The child  --  you mean ? GREENOUGH Yes , of course . STEWART Yes , yes , of course . JANET comes back into the room during the pause that falls instantly . JANET Now . GREENOUGH Giving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and starts out , but pauses near the table . JANET We 're going to light these candles tonight at dinner . GREENOUGH Oh  --  really ? p. 9 STEWART I see  --  How jolly . JANET again goes through the swinging door . Great preparations have been going on , I see  --  even to those little roses in that bowl  --  He goes and looks down at the table . I 'll wager there 's just a dozen , even , and  --  you see the stems are very short  --  that they cost a dollar and a half around the corner . GREENOUGH I 'll wager there 's an extra one or two that the florists threw in . . . . She 's like that  --  STEWART Who ? GREENOUGH Edith  --  Mrs. Fields  --  Count ' em  --  STEWART One-two-three . . . eight-nine-ten  --  You 're right  --  fourteen . I 'm glad it was n't thirteen . I rather like all this . I would n't want these people to have any bad luck . . . . Why did n't she go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to try it . I suppose he knew that ships are n't always punctual . . . . At any rate , I offered her my motor but she did n't want it . JANET Returning . There 's just room for the other one  --  Mrs. Price had to take some things out , though . p. 10 GREENOUGH Here you are . He gives her the other . JANET Mrs. Price says it 's not cider , but  --  GREENOUGH We 'll leave that to your father . He 'll know what it is . Are n't we going to see Mrs. Price ? JANET Yes , sir , she 's coming in a minute . She goes again . STEWART Suddenly , quietly . Is Mrs. Fields very beautiful ? GREENOUGH Very beautiful ? A little puzzled . Did I ever say she was beautiful ? STEWART She must be . Is n't she ? GREENOUGH I do n't think so . Yes , perhaps she is  --  I do n't really know ! STEWART Who 's Mrs. Price ? GREENOUGH The wife of one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEWART And , as I understand it , being an inquisitive employer was what brought you into the Prices ' social circle in Harlem . GREENOUGH Exactly . The uplifters would approve of me . As they would put it , I " take an interest " in my men . p. 11 STEWART Funny how you can know a man all your life  --  your own cousin , for instance  --  and find out new things about him every day . I might never have known of this interesting phase of yours , now , if I had n't run into you coming out of Maillard 's and begged to be taken wherever you were going . GREENOUGH I hope you 're going to prove so useful that I 'm not going to be sorry I brought you . STEWART Oh  --  I 'm to be useful ? To whom ? GREENOUGH To Mrs. Fields , I hope . STEWART Suspiciously . And you . . . ? There are forms of usefulness that I 've certain prejudices against , Walter . GREENOUGH Damn it , Ned  --  get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rle of a villain . Or keep them  --  if you like  --  only get it out of your head that you 're to preside at a scandal . . . . When I have a scandal  --  if I ever do  --  you wo n't be called in to assist . STEWART Thanks . I really do n't like messes . Not messy messes  --  where everybody concerned is much too good for that sort of thing , you know  --  and ought not to have got in so deep . . . . Things do happen , sometimes . Usually the people who get into messes are the people that do n't matter . But I 've seen any number of good men  --  and one or two good women  --  in my time  --  blunder right into hell before they had any idea of what they were up to . . . and . . . I do n't like . . . to look on . . . . His voice has trailed off a bit uncertainly. p. 12 GREENOUGH Drily . I do n't think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant 's pause . Then he speaks , decisively . Fields does n't happen to be an engineer . I ca n't help him . He happens to be a painter . You take an interest in that sort of thing . I do n't  --  particularly . And when I ran into you today it occurred to me that I might bring you along and introduce you to Mrs. Fields  --  and that you might keep an eye open in order to help her husband  --  if he 's any good . I do n't know one single thing about him except that some mysterious benefactor sent him to Paris to study for a year and that Mrs. Fields has shown the most enormous pluck in supporting herself and her child by sewing during his absence . STEWART That 's rather interesting . He looks about . A painter emerging from wall-paper like this  --  the " Angelus " on one wall  --  and " Hope " on another . What 's his name  --  the young painter 's ? GREENOUGH Julien Fields . STEWART Seems to me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other  --  MRS . PRICE enters , with JANET following. p. 13 MRS . PRICE How do you do , Mr. Greenough ? GREENOUGH Oh , hello . May I introduce my cousin , Theodore Stewart , Mrs. Price ? MRS . PRICE Putting out her hand . Pleased to meet you , Mr. Stewart . I 've seen your name in the papers . STEWART That 's rather alarming . You make me think that you know all about me . And I hope you do n't . I hope nobody does . MRS . PRICE Just a little awkwardly . Oh , yes ; you 're very well known . You both are , for that matter . GREENOUGH Really . . . . How 's your husband , Mrs. Price ? I have n't seen him for a few days . MRS . PRICE I do n't see him much myself . He 's going to that school at nights that you recommended . GREENOUGH You wo n't blame me for that five years from now . MRS . PRICE Oh , no , sir ; please do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . . . . We just stopped to see Mrs. Fields a moment . Have you any idea how long she 'll be  --  or just when her husband is expected ? We do n't want to be in the way . p. 14 MRS . PRICE Oh , Edith wo n't be long now . I 'm sure of that . She just asked me to step upstairs  --  to STEWART I live on the next floor  --  and watch the chicken that 's roasting while she ran around the corner . Knowing that she wanted everything very nice tonight , I was glad to oblige her . I know she 'll be put out if you do n't wait . GREENOUGH We 'll wait , all right , if you think she  --  MRS . PRICE Interrupting . Oh , I know she 'll be delighted . To STEWART . You ca n't imagine how nice Mr. Greenough has been to Mrs. Fields . He 's been simply lovely to her  --  GREENOUGH Quickly . I rather imagine everyone likes to " be nice "  --  as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you 've sent her such lovely things and taken her on such lovely rides and you 've been so lovely to Janet  --  I was just saying last night to Mr. Price : " I do hope Mr. Fields takes Mr. Greenough 's kindness to his wife in the right spirit and appreciates it . " And do you know what Mr. Price said  --  ? GREENOUGH Drily . I have n't the least idea . p. 15 MRS . PRICE " If he do n't , he 's a fool , " he said , and then I said , " But some men ca n't help having jealous natures  --  " She pauses . No one speaks . She hurries on . There  --  maybe I 've said something I should n't ! But I only thought  --  GREENOUGH Briefly . You must give Price my regards and tell him that my secretary has a couple of books for him that I think he 'll enjoy reading . MRS . PRICE Oh , thank you , sir , I will . . . . I guess I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll excuse me . GREENOUGH Certainly  --  She goes toward the door . MRS . PRICE To JANET , who is at a window looking out . Come on , kiddie  --  I 've got some work for you . JANET All right . To STEWART , indicating the window curtains . Mother just finished making these yesterday . They 're new . STEWART So I see . They 're pretty , are n't they ? She nods and then follows MRS . PRICE into the kitchen . STEWART watches for the door to close and then speaks with energetic distaste . Well , I will say one thing , Walter . I do n't believe you or any other fairly civilised man could work up a romantic interest in the Venus de Milo  --  or Cleopatra  --  or Helen of Troy in the perfectly respectable lower-middle-class environment of a Harlem flat . A bit of a song is heard coming near. p. 16 GREENOUGH Somebody 's coming . Wait  --  I think  --  The door opens and EDITH FIELDS enters . The song leaves her lips as she sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . Her arms are full of autumn leaves and brown asters . She pauses sharply and then advances quickly toward GREENOUGH . EDITH Oh  --  Mr. Greenough ! I thought that was your car downstairs . GREENOUGH Yes  --  I hope you do n't mind our running in like this  --  for a moment . Mrs. Fields , I think you 've heard me mention Ned Stewart  --  my cousin ? EDITH Giving him her hand . Oh , yes . How do you do , Mr. Stewart ? To GREENOUGH . You said once you wanted Julien to know him , did n't you ? GREENOUGH nods . EDITH hurries on , her voice suddenly dreamy with happiness . Is n't it too wonderful ? . . . He 's coming . . . . Both men glance at each other , then at her , and both are held speechless by the look in her face . Then her thoughts come back and she glances a little impatiently at the clock . What time is it ? Only six ! . . . I telephoned from the drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , thank God . . . . He 's somewhere in this very city now , hurrying home . . . . I 've been everywhere trying to find some autumn leaves  --  and I found these , at last ; he loves them . Are n't they wonderful ? And these asters ? I must put them in water . . . . She goes toward the kitchen door  --  looking back as she is about to leave them . You 'll pardon me  --  a moment ? p. 17 STEWART Of course . . . . She goes out . There is a pause . Then GREENOUGH looks at his watch mechanically . GREENOUGH Without expression . The ship 's in . He 's coming  --  we must go . STEWART With a look that has something of sympathy in it . Yes ; it 's not likely that he 'd want to find us here . GREENOUGH Suddenly , apropos of nothing . There 's something about her that 's extraordinarily  --  that 's  --  He gropes for the word . That 's  --  STEWART You mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I like to think that there are such things in the world as her devotion and courage and simplicity . I do n't believe anything that could happen to her could spoil or change her . STEWART The thing you do n't realise is that every other woman you know is just as capable as Mrs. Fields of devotion and courage and simplicity . GREENOUGH I do n't believe it . p. 18 STEWART Oh , yes , they are . It 's rather the fashion to hide these things , I admit . But do n't think you ca n't find them all over the place if you care to look . There 's my mother , now . After fifty years she feels exactly like that about my puffy little father . And our cousin , Alice  --  GREENOUGH Perhaps  --  only  --  STEWART Only you 're damned sentimental about Mrs. Julien Fields , Walter , and I 'm very glad for your sake that the wandering husband arrives today . GREENOUGH Do n't you think it 's perfectly possible for a man to appreciate another man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal them ? EDITH enters again , carrying a vase filled with leaves and flowers . Let me help you . He takes the vase . Where shall I put it ? EDITH Suppose we try it here  --  there ! STEWART That 's very successful , I think . EDITH Yes ,  --  is n't it ? To GREENOUGH . I 've such a lot to thank you for  --  and here are more flowers  --  She picks up the box and opens it as they talk. p. 19 GREENOUGH I took the privilege of remembering that this was a great day for the household . EDITH You never forget anything . The flowers are lovely , of course ,  --  but it 's the champagne you brought for Julien  --  She pauses , looking up from the box of flowers , and smiles radiantly . GREENOUGH It 's always fun to help give a party . EDITH You see , I know Julien likes champagne . But the poor boy has never had it often . He likes so many things that are dreadfully expensive and rare and fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his life . He 'd always choose the best . STEWART We can believe that  --  seeing that he chose you . EDITH That 's a nice thing to say  --  but I 'm not sure who did the choosing in that case . I rather think I did . And I was the one who showed that I liked the best that time . GREENOUGH I suppose when two people are born on the same day and brought up next door to each other as intimately as you and your husband were , it is difficult to say who did the choosing  --  it 's so natural that you should care for each other under the circumstances . p. 20 STEWART Were you really born on the same day  --  and brought up together ? EDITH Gravely . Oh , yes . But that 's not very strange , is it ? Our mothers were friends . They lived in a little town in Indiana . Afterward both had their troubles  --  Julien 's father and mine were killed in the same railroad wreck , and our mothers went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course there was a certain closeness in the way that Julien and I grew up  --  and I suppose it does seem natural for us to have cared for each other  --  only  --  She pauses , as if about to say something that she 's not sure she should say . GREENOUGH Go on  --  what were you going to say ? EDITH Unexpectedly . Are you married , Mr. Stewart ? STEWART I  --  I ? Hesitates just an instant . GREENOUGH flashes him a look of sympathy , but he continues calmly . Yes  --  I am married . EDITH Then you will understand what I mean  --  Mr. Greenough would think it a little silly , I 'm afraid . She turns directly to GREENOUGH , smiling . Unless you 've been married you really would n't understand . What I was about to say is  --  she turns to STEWART again  --  that in spite of its all seeming so natural  --  our having been boy and girl together and caring for each other always  --  as if it were meant , somehow  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that there 's a great strangeness about love . . . . There is a bare pause . She rests from gathering the flowers in her hands , and her eyes see far-off things as she continues in a lower voice . Yes , I 'm very sure that love is the strangest thing in the world  --  much stranger than death  --  or  --  or just life . p. 21 GREENOUGH I understand that , I think . EDITH Suddenly , earnestly , swiftly . Oh , but do you understand things like this  --  things that come out of the terrible clairvoyance of love ? Things that  --  Once just before Julien and I were married I began to walk with a limp . He was away that week . When he came back he was on crutches . He 'd broken his leg , but he had n't let me know  --  Then , of course , there have been all sorts of more usual things  --  like our getting up to write to each other at the same hour of the night . . . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant need . STEWART A little awkwardly . This separation must have been very difficult for you  --  both . EDITH We made up our minds that it was his great chance . STEWART I do n't think that it was necessary for my cousin to point out to me that I might be of some service to your husband . I think this meeting with you would have made me anxious to be of any use possible . EDITH Thanks ; I do n't know just what there is that anyone can do  --  She halts. p. 22 STEWART Do you know what his plans are for the immediate future ? If he wants people to see his work ? EDITH I do n't really know just what he means to do . You see , I do n't know anything about painters  --  or art . Julien never meant to be an artist at all . That just happened to him . GREENOUGH To STEWART . Did I tell you that he was with an advertising firm  --  doing what 's called commercial drawing  --  when someone with discernment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEWART No ; I understood that some picture of his had attracted attention  --  EDITH That 's true , too . It was one he 'd painted  --  just for fun  --  in oils  --  of Janet and me . Wait , I 'll get his scrap-book and show you some of the things he did the last year he was with his firm . She is about to go out of the room , but pauses to take a booklet from the table . Here 's a pamphlet that he illustrated  --  if you 'd like to look at it . STEWART  --  Thanks . She goes . Both men glance over the pamphlet . GREENOUGH Reading . " How to spend your vacation "  --  The handsome lady and the handsome gentleman starting off on horseback are n't half bad  --  are they ? p. 23 STEWART  --  No ; for this banal sort of stuff I should say they were exceptionally well done . Did he ever study anywhere ? GREENOUGH  --  I believe he went to the Art League  --  for a time . STEWART  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  well done  --  without the glimmer of an idea or a thought . GREENOUGH  --  Possibly ideas and thoughts were forbidden . STEWART  --  Possibly . One ca n't judge fairly by this  --  GREENOUGH  --  I suppose there was something unusual about his picture of his wife and child , or the mysterious benefactor who saw it in the window of the shop  --  where his firm had sent it to be framed  --  would not have taken the trouble to be a fairy godfather  --  if there are such things as fairy godfathers as well as fairy godmothers . STEWART Suddenly . Look here  --  I think I know who that fairy godmother was  --  for it was a she instead of a he , if I 'm right . I think Hester Dahlgren told me something about discovering a young man quite satisfactorily poor and ignorant and talented . p. 24 GREENOUGH  --  Hester Dahlgren ! But does she know what 's what ? STEWART  --  Not a damned thing ! She 's one of those women with fool enthusiasms who like to meddle with other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one  --  He shrugs his shoulders . GREENOUGH  --  Well  --  I do n't suppose Hester 's romantic meddling  --  if it was Hester  --  has hurt anything . She may not have discovered a genius , but  --  STEWART  --  At the worst she 's probably let a good draughtsman waste some time . They glance through the pamphlet . Here 's a child on the beach that 's rather nice . EDITH returns carrying a big book . EDITH  --  Here are all sorts of things that I 've kept  --  STEWART  --  I 've seen enough to know that your husband is very clever . Whether he 's on the right road as an artist  --  or whether he 's an artist at all , or not  --  is another story . You must let me meet him very soon . EDITH  --  Oh , if you 'll come any time  --  any time after tomorrow . Tomorrow will be a sort of holiday . p. 25 STEWART  --  I understand ; and now I think we 'd better go and leave you alone with your happy thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for coming . To GREENOUGH . And thanks so much for everything  --  particularly Julien 's champagne . JANET enters  --  EDITH addresses her . Thank Mr. Greenough again for the candy , darling , and tell him and Mr. Stewart good-bye . JANET  --  Thanks again ,  --  and  --  GREENOUGH  --  Perhaps your mother will let you take your usual trip as far as the corner with me . JANET  --  Oh , may I , mother ? Please ! EDITH  --  Yes  --  I think so  --  if  --  GREENOUGH Quickly . Then come along ! She runs and opens the door . STEWART joins her on the threshold . GREENOUGH holds EDITH 'S hand an instant . Good-bye , then  --  and good luck  --  and many happy returns of both birthdays . EDITH  --  Good-bye , Mr. . . . I always want to call you " Mr. Santa Claus " instead of Mr. Greenough. p. 26 GREENOUGH  --  You 've not much reason to do so  --  but I 'll drive my reindeer to your chimney any time you 'll let me  --  whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool 's day  --  any time at all . Do n't forget that . . . . He leaves her and joins JANET and STEWART in the doorway  --  turning back to wave his hand again . Then all three call back " good-bye "  --  the door shuts , and they are gone . There is an instant 's pause . EDITH moves toward the window and stands looking out . MRS . PRICE enters from the next room . She has to speak twice before EDITH is aware of her . MRS . PRICE  --  Are they gone . . . ? I said  --  did the gentlemen go ? EDITH Turning . Oh , yes  --  they 've gone . MRS . PRICE  --  Well  --  it 's a good thing you had me to depend on . If you had n't you never would have gotten anything done in the kitchen  --  not with your head in the clouds like it 's been all day . EDITH  --  I 'm sure of that . You 've been a great comfort , Ada . MRS . PRICE  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you knew you was going to sit down . . . . However , there 's nothing there that will spoil , even if it 's not eaten until ten tonight . Do you suppose Mr. Fields will take a taxi or come up in the subway ? p. 27 EDITH  --  I do n't know . He 'll have all his things to carry . I suppose he 'll have to take a taxi . MRS . PRICE  --  Well , there 's no telling when he 'll get here  --  and as I knew that I made Janet drink a glass of milk and eat a piece of bread and butter a minute ago . It 's her dinner-time now and I did n't think the child ought to be allowed to go hungry . EDITH  --  I suppose you were right . MRS . PRICE  --  Do n't you think you 'd better have something yourself ? EDITH  --  Oh , no  --  I 'll wait for Julien . There is just a tiny pause . MRS . PRICE  --  Well , I 'll go along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know just to call . EDITH  --  You 've done enough today . . . . I wo n't bother you any more . And I 'll never forget it , Ada . MRS . PRICE  --  And why should n't I ? Have n't you helped me make everything I have that 's fit to wear ? I often wish there was more . Give Mr. Fields my best regards . EDITH  --  I will . MRS . PRICE  --  And you tell him for me that no matter how famous or rich he 's going to get he 's not a bit too good for you . p. 28 EDITH  --  Oh  --  nonsense , Ada ! I 'll tell him nothing of the sort . MRS . PRICE  --  I will , then . . . . I 've watched you very close , Edith . You 're not a woman who can get her head turned easy  --  and a husband ought to appreciate that . . . . It 's getting dark . Well , good night , dear . EDITH  --  Good-night . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . But JANET 'S voice shrills from the stairs . JANET Outside . Oh , mother  --  mother ! He 's come ! MRS . PRICE As EDITH turns radiantly about . That settles it . I 'm going to stay right here and see that this dinner gets put on the table . She turns toward the kitchen . JANET  --  Mother  --  father 's here  --  She is in the doorway now . He 's getting out of an automobile ! MRS . PRICE  --  Go down and meet him . EDITH Still in a radiant daze , to MRS . PRICE , who is lighting the candles on the table . Oh , please do n't  --  p. 29 MRS . PRICE  --  Run on down . I 'll attend to everything here and not get in your way , either  --  EDITH  --  Oh , but  --  but  --  She would like to be alone , but suddenly she laughs and catches at JANET 'S hand . Then come , darling ! Let 's see who will get the first kiss ! She races from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with her . MRS . PRICE finishes with the candles , hurries out , and returns with a vase containing the white roses that GREENOUGH brought . She places these on a side table , hurries out , and brings in the bread and butter . Then she goes into the kitchen and does not at once return . There is a brief pause . JANET comes back , almost creeping into the room . She stands huddled and a little frightened by the door , waiting . Then EDITH returns  --  silent and slow of movement and lost and uncertain . Voices float up from the stairway . EDITH stands near the door , her eyes wide with disappointment , amazement . JANET goes and puts her hand in hers . They wait near the open door . JULIEN FIELDS , burdened with bags , etc. , appears in the hall just outside , and pauses under the gas-jet . JULIEN Calling down the stairway . Courage , Olga . Only one more flight ! We arrive , Oscar  --  nous sommes ici ! He enters . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than artistically  --  yet with a certain suggestion of the Quartier Latin in both manners and clothes . His hat is crushed under his arm  --  his coat hangs over one shoulder and he carries a big portfolio and a bag . Immediately behind him follows a bare-headed , wildly dressed young man , very big and blond , and laden with luggage. p. 30 JULIEN Indicating EDITH , but speaking to OSCAR . Enter , my friend  --  and permit me to inform you that this charming creature who precipitated herself into my arms on the sidewalk is my wife . Edith , my child , this is Oscar , a scoundrel , a Swede , and a philosopher . OSCAR  --  Greetings , Edith and  --  He looks at JANET . JULIEN  --  You may have heard me mention in my unguarded moments that there was a child . Her name is Janet . OSCAR  --  Thank God it 's not Muriel . Salutations , Janet . JULIEN  --  That 's his idea of humour , Edith . Do n't mind anything he says . To OSCAR . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the floor below , rolling a cigarette . If you had looked back as Lot 's wife and I did , you would have seen a considerable crowd gathering to observe her . Or perhaps they were observing Dame Dahlgren 's impressive footman laden with your possessions trying to decide whether to step over her or wait respectfully for her to proceed before him . You will have to be patient with Olga , Edith . She is mad , a nomad , and a musician . . . . A mad , nomad musician  --  yes  --  that will serve as a description of Olga . Also she is a child  --  a child as primitive as her Russian plains . He has gradually unburdened himself , so that the room is cluttered up with luggage . JULIEN , seeing EDITH so unresponsive and hurt , suddenly speaks in a different , businesslike voice , kicking at the bags on the floor. p. 31 JULIEN  --  Where do you want these things put , Edith ? EDITH In a low , tight voice . In  --  in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the pieces that OSCAR has just deposited . He looks about the room curiously as though he had never seen it before  --  as he speaks very casually to OSCAR . JULIEN  --  I 'll take care of these  --  while you lend a hand to the footman that 's Olga stalled on the stairs . OSCAR  --  Trs bien  --  why not ? He 's probably a poor man with eleven children . . . . I hope you approve of nonsense , Edith . He goes out  --  through the door that has been standing open . JULIEN Staring about still and speaking half-bitterly , half-humorously to himself as he stands holding a traveling bag in each hand . And I lived here seven years . . . with the Angelus and  --  He turns suddenly to EDITH . Did we always have this wall-paper , Edith ? EDITH Still in a low , tight voice . I suppose it is rather soiled and faded , but the landlord was n't willing to put on new  --  and I  --  She halts and then changes the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , with us , Julien ? p. 32 JULIEN Uncomfortably but with coolness . Oh , I see . . . . You do n't like my friends . I 'm sorry . But they wo n't stay long  --  only until they can find another place . I hope you 'll not mind that . EDITH With painful matter-of-factness . Then I 'd better lay two more places at the table . JULIEN  --  Good heavens  --  nobody wants dinner at this hour . EDITH Apologetically . Then we wo n't have it yet . I just had it ready  --  so that if you were hungry . . . She stops , not quite able to go on . JULIEN  --  Oh , well  --  just as you like , of course . We might as well have it now  --  if it 's ready . You 'll get used to Oscar . He 's really an amusing fellow . He starts toward the closed door of the bedroom  --  and pauses , his hands full . Open this door for me , Janet  --  will you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her an instant . Three times as tall as you were a year ago  --  at least ! Do you forgive your father for trying to be a famous man , Janet ,  --  instead of the nice stay-at-home regular kind ? She is too much at sea to answer . JULIEN , still looking at her , laughs suddenly as he moves away . I 'm afraid you do n't . He goes into the next room . JANET runs to her mother. p. 33 JANET In a low , alarmed voice . What 's wrong , mother ? EDITH  --  ' Ssh . . . . Nothing , dear , nothing . . . . JANET  --  May I go downstairs and play on the steps ? I do n't want any dinner . I 'm not hungry , mother . Please  --  Her mother does not instantly answer her . She continues to plead uneasily . Wo n't you let me go downstairs ? EDITH  --  You might as well . Yes , go downstairs if you want to , child . MRS . PRICE hurries into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken . JANET , after a wavering look at her mother , slips out of the room and downstairs . MRS . PRICE Here 's the chicken . I 'll put it here for Mr. Fields to carve . Well  --  ? She is immensely curious . I thought I heard several voices . EDITH Julien brought some friends . I 'll do the rest  --  She starts toward the kitchen door . MRS . PRICE Hesitating , then yielding to the set determination in EDITH 'S face . Well , everything 's all ready . Maybe I 'd better go down , anyway , and see about Earle . He was n't coming home , but maybe he 's changed his mind . Had n't I better get some extra plates , first ? p. 34 EDITH No , I 'll do it . MRS . PRICE All right . I  --  I 'll see you in the morning , I guess . EDITH Oh , yes . MRS . PRICE , very well aware that something uncomfortable has happened , hesitates , then takes off her apron and goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDITH returns with two covered dishes which she puts on the able . JULIEN also returns , and busies himself with the luggage . JULIEN Wryly  --  but trying to make the best of a situation . I 'll stack these things up  --  over here . He moves them against the wall . There 's really not enough room , I suppose , for Oscar and Olga , and if they once got unpacked they would probably decide to stay forever . EDITH Is she his wife ? JULIEN Olga ?  --  Oscar 's wife ? Good heavens ! No . EDITH Is n't it rather strange , then  --  ? JULIEN Our having her along ? I suppose it is  --  to you . JULIEN arranges the luggage and then turns again to EDITH . At her hurt bewilderment he laughs , but unsteadily and uneasily , and speaks with sudden humorous compassion . Poor Edith ! You should n't have made me go . OSCAR again looms in the doorway , laden with bags , and stooping forward. p. 35 OSCAR Let the camel kneel and be unburdened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name a French pronunciation ; JULIEN helps relieve him . JULIEN Drop the things here . . . . JULIEN indicates the corner where he has piled the rest of the luggage . A young woman , very picturesque and eccentric-looking , appears in the doorway  --  a cigarette in a long holder between her lips . Her hair is short , and she carries a samovar and under one arm an untidy lot of music sheets . OLGA Ah  --  She strolls into the room , staring about her , explaining blandly in an accented voice . One page of ze manuscript in Zito 's new concerto I have lost . It is possible that it remains in the motor . The servant searches there now . OSCAR Cease to lament , Olga . That concerto is n't worth a damn , anyway . OLGA With a radiant smile at EDITH . Men are without compunction and scruple  --  always . Is it not so , Madame ? Are you really the wife of our shocking little Julien , chrie ? Or do they make a joke to me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that I am Julien 's wife . p. 36 OLGA Then I pity you , Madame . He is quite mad . He himself knows it . But there is a talent somewhere in those lazy fingers of his . Where is ze piano ? JULIEN There is n't one . OLGA No piano ! JULIEN We apologise  --  but there is n't a piano . OLGA Zen I do not remain . A piano I must have . And tonight . To OSCAR . Take ze things that are mine again to the motor before it departs . To EDITH . I have a thousand regrets that I go  --  but I will come again , Madame , when my technique and my mood do not require zat I play . JULIEN But you do not know where to go to find a piano tonight . OLGA Zat is not important . I will search . OSCAR Then I 'll go with you . And a piano you shall have . To EDITH . My regrets , Edith  --  it is difficult to leave both you and that charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is imperative and must be obeyed . We may return anon . He kisses EDITH 'S hand. p. 37 OLGA Kissing JULIEN . Au ' voir , my friend . At my first concert bring your beau-ful , serious wife . Au ' voir , Madame . JULIEN Well , good luck with the piano , you crazy pair ! EDITH has bowed her head to OSCAR and whispered " good-bye " to OLGA , who now go rattling down the stairs in a clamour of French . JULIEN follows them out , calling down " A bientt ! " after them . Then he returns , and closes the door . He pauses awkwardly and then moves toward the table . I suppose we might as well begin . Do you want me to cut this chicken ? EDITH Yes  --  or I 'll do it , if you do n't want to  --  JULIEN I will . He cuts it . EDITH Is the knife sharp enough ? JULIEN It 'll do . He serves her silently , giving all his attention to doing so . Is that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pause in which he serves himself . Here are the potatoes  --  and the beans . She indicates the vegetable dishes and offers to serve them. p. 38 JULIEN Thank you . He holds his plate . She takes some , but neither touches the food . He speaks suddenly . I suppose there 's not such a thing as a drop of wine in the place ? EDITH Rising suddenly . I forgot ! She hurries into the kitchen . His head drops between his hands . She returns with a bottle of champagne . Here 's some  --  JULIEN Taking sudden notice . Good heavens  --  champagne ? Where did you ever get it ? EDITH Someone sent it  --  for you . JULIEN Good heavens ! Who  --  EDITH A man named Greenough . Ada Price 's husband works in one of his engine plants . He 's always doing nice things for people . JULIEN More to himself than her . Well , we 'll take what the gods send  --  and ask no questions . He pours a glass . Have some ? She shakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head drops between her hands . He drinks . EDITH Suddenly , with a sob in her voice . Oh , Julien ! He drains his glass before he answers. p. 39 JULIEN Come , come . Let 's not be tragic . There 's nothing to be tragic about . . . . She lifts her face , wet with tears . For God 's sake , do n't cry ! Be reasonable . EDITH Again , brokenly . Oh , Julien ! JULIEN Pouring another glass of wine ; almost violently . I 've come back . Yes  --  I 've changed . I 'll try to do my best . But I 'm different , of course . . . . You did n't expect me to come back unchanged , did you ? EDITH So you do not love me any longer . . . . JULIEN Love ! What in the name of God has Love got to do with it ? It 's life ! Just life . Life has a way of picking people up and tearing them apart  --  and taking them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen to any of us next . EDITH But ca n't you tell me what 's happened to you , Julien ? JULIEN Everything . . . . Talking 's no good . EDITH But , Julien  --  you and I  --  all our lives  --  we 've been so  --  JULIEN I know . I know . p. 40 EDITH We were n't like other husbands and wives who just happened to meet and like each other and get married . We were each other 's always . JULIEN Yes  --  we were each other 's . Too much each other 's . EDITH And now  --  I 'm still yours  --  but you are n't mine  --  JULIEN You ca n't talk about these things . They happen . Nobody wants them to happen . They just happen . EDITH I do n't know what you 've done  --  or what 's happened to you . I only know you 've come back a stranger  --  and that I ca n't bear it ! She lays her face in her folded arms . For an instant there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said I had changed . But what can we do about it ? You sent me away . You wanted me to get on . . . a man ca n't go and find out what the world is and remain tied to his wife 's apron strings . . . . Good God ! These readjustments ! How long have I been away ? A year or a lifetime ? EDITH Looking up gravely . You 're being terribly cruel , Julien . JULIEN I 'm trying to be honest . I ca n't bring back what I used to feel for you , Edith . What do you want me to do ? Pretend ? I 'm sorry , but . . . He pauses , shrugging. p. 41 EDITH Still gravely . Do you love some other woman ? JULIEN Rising . No ! My God ! No ! I never have and I never will . Love ! Love ! Love ! I 've had enough of love . Love 's not everything  --  as you women think . Love is damned little  --  when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . Then you 've been faithful , at least . That 's a great load off my heart . There is another pause . He paces the floor nervously and then comes back and sits in his chair at the table . JULIEN No  --  not even that . He takes up a candle  --  blows it out  --  strikes match after match , and then remembers what he is doing and lights the candle and sets it back . EDITH rises blindly . He catches at her hand . Sit down . She obeys . He speaks again . I wonder if I can make you understand . . . . These  --  these affairs with other women have n't meant anything to me . You 've been the only woman , Edith . You 've had the best of me . You 've had all my youth . Be content with that . You had the years when I should have been free . And we wronged each other  --  you and I  --  because you should have had your freedom , too . p. 42 EDITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have wronged each other ? When we only loved each other ? JULIEN It was wrong for me to know nothing  --  nothing of life  --  except what I learned in a little office filled with drab workingmen at their desks  --  and what I found here  --  here in a little four-room flat in Harlem . Here . . . where our everlasting conversation was about an increase in salary  --  or the price of eggs  --  or what to name the baby . For thirty years I was yours , Edith  --  Since the day we were both born you 've stood between me and the freedom my soul needed if it was to find  --  to find the things that the soul of every man ought to hunt for  --  the things that have nothing at all to do with the price of eggs or the money in his pocket or even his child 's name . Do you understand ? EDITH Shaking her head blindly . Only that you want to be free  --  so  --  you 'd better  --  go  --  now  --  tonight . JULIEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want me to go ? EDITH Do you want to go ? JULIEN Not unless I must . There is another pause . He rises  --  and stands by the window and continues presently . There 's a world outside this window that you do n't know anything about . . . . We ca n't live like babes in a wood again . . . . I can come back to you and come back to this room  --  but there 's no way back to our yesterdays  --  and if there were  --  we ought not to want to take it . p. 43 EDITH Be patient with me , Julien . All I can understand is that you do n't love me and that you do n't want to love me . . . and there is n't anything at all left in your heart  --  for me . JULIEN I 've come back  --  have n't I ? EDITH I wonder why ? JULIEN I had to come sometime  --  I did n't quite remember that you were like this . I did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought not to have let me go . EDITH No  --  I ought not to have let you go  --  my  --   --  my precious  --  A sob checks her . JULIEN Please do n't  --  it hurts  --  please  --  Her sobs cease , but she does not speak . He moves impatiently . I ca n't stand this . He finds his hat and cloak and goes to the door . As he opens it she rises , and cries out desperately . EDITH Where  --  where are you going ? JULIEN Also desperately  --  in a low , hard voice . I do n't know . . . . I do n't care . . . . I 'll be back later , I suppose . The door closes behind him . EDITH goes toward it , but sits suddenly  --  huddling into a large chair . She is very still . A clock strikes . The moments go by . . . Presently JANET enters p. 44 EDITH Not seeing who it is  --  and starting up as she hears the door open and close . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes and sits on her mother 's lap . EDITH Are you tired , dear ? JANET A little . JANET clings to her . EDITH What 's the matter with mother 's big girl ? JANET Nothing .  --  Let 's play I 'm a little baby . EDITH All right . You 're a little baby now . JANET Sing " Bye-o " to your little baby . EDITH Singing . " Bye-o , baby buntin '  --  Daddy 's gone a-hunting  --  " She halts . JANET Go on , go on . . . . Hunting what ? EDITH With a sob . God knows . . . . THE CURTAIN FALLS @x A year later . A rather big , shabby room in an old house that was once magnificent , near Washington Square . At the back there are two doors . One , larger than the other , leads out into the wide , high hallway of the house ; the other into a small hall bedroom . At the left there are the two big windows usual in such rooms in such houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room that JULIEN uses as a studio . At the side of a rather large round table painted orange colour is an immense chair upholstered in shabby , faded stuff that was once brilliantly flowered chintz . A lamp with a crudely devised yellow shade stands on the table . Two low , built-in bookcases are filled mainly with china and glasses . Another table , square and painted black and set about with four painted chairs , stands in the right-hand corner . A stencilled cloth runs like a brilliant streak across it . A seven-armed brass candlestick is at one end and a vase filled with leafy white roses at the other . Except for strips of red stuff at each side of the window there are no curtains . An incongruously handsome chandelier hangs from the ceiling in the centre  --  but later when the lights are turned on only two of the dozen bulbs flare . JULIEN is talking to MRS . PRICE . She seems on the point of taking her departure  --  somewhat reluctantly . JULIEN As if continuing a conversation . Oh , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Edith was wondering what had become of you only the other day . p. 46 MRS . PRICE Looking about curiously as she speaks . Is n't that funny ? I was thinking of her , too , only the other day ; and I says to Earle , " I 'm just going to take the elevated some day and go straight down and see Edith Fields . " And he said , " I wonder what 's become of her and her husband and little Janet ? I suppose she 's grown a good deal in the last six months . " JULIEN I think I have heard her mother mention that her frocks had to come down a bit at the knees . But I have n't noticed that she looks much different . MRS . PRICE Is n't it funny how soon you can lose track of people in New York ? Only the other night at a picture show I saw a man and woman speaking to Earle and I ; and I did n't know them till they come up and told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right across the hall from us in the same boarding-house for two years when we first came to the city . To tell you the truth , I had lost Edith 's address , but I had intended asking Earle if he could get it through Mr. Greenough  --  though I suppose you do n't see so much of him now . JULIEN Oh , yes , we see him now and then . MRS . PRICE Interested . Oh . . . I thought maybe  --  He was always so lovely to Edith  --  being as she was alone , and a friend of ours . He 's very much interested in Earle. p. 47 JULIEN And how is your husband ? MRS . PRICE Fine . He 's got an idea of some kind that Mr. Greenough is going to have patented for him . And he 's had another raise . JULIEN That 's good . MRS . PRICE stares about . For an instant the conversation drops . MRS . PRICE This looks like a nice roomy place . JULIEN Yes  --  it is  --  rather roomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them , however . MRS . PRICE Only two rooms ! JULIEN Yes  --  this and my studio  --  in there . He indicates the big door at the right . And a bedroom  --  such as it is  --  He indicates by a glance the door at the back to the left . MRS . PRICE Oh ! Can I peep ? JULIEN Certainly  --  though there 's not much to see . MRS . PRICE From the doorway . This looks more familiar . Edith has kept some of her things , I see . p. 48 JULIEN Yes  --  a few . We sold most of them . They did n't fit in very well  --  here . His annoyance is increasing . MRS . PRICE She 's got the same white bureau  --  and her bed and Janet 's little one  --  it was hard work getting them both in there , was n't it ? With the sewing machine , too . JULIEN She has considerable ingenuity about such things . MRS . PRICE I should say she had  --  and she 's as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes forward . She looks at the couch . I suppose that opens out to make a bed at night . JULIEN I do n't think so . MRS . PRICE Going to the couch and feeling it . Do n't tell me Edith makes you sleep out here on a hard , narrow  --  JULIEN No  --  the studio is my domain . I 'm very comfortable there . The conversation drops again . Wo n't you sit down ? MRS . PRICE You 're sure she 's coming down ? JULIEN She 's coming  --  I know that . But I ca n't say just how soon . p. 49 MRS . PRICE Well , I do want to see her . When I saw your address in the paper this morning  --  I made up my mind to come right down . But I did n't get started as early as I meant to  --  and I spent half an hour finding the place  --  so I 'm afraid I ca n't wait . JULIEN As a matter of fact , perhaps you 'd better not . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes . Of course you can wait if you do n't mind being left alone . MRS . PRICE No , I want to get started so 's to be ahead of that awful jam going uptown . The cars will all be crowded pretty soon  --  even if they are n't already . Well  --  She looks about reluctantly . I do n't feel my trip was all in vain . I 'm glad to have seen your new home . Edith do n't mind it not being very modern , I suppose . JULIEN We have most of the conveniences  --  though the house is an old one , of course . MRS . PRICE Artistic things are very much the style now , anyway . She glances about again . Oh  --  you must have a kitchen somewhere , have n't you ? JULIEN Impatiently . There 's a kitchenette  --  off a little passage beyond the studio . I would n't dare to show you that . Edith 's very much ashamed of it . . . . I 'll tell her how sorry you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . He is trying to manuvre her out. p. 50 MRS . PRICE I will  --  and you tell Edith about me losing the address  --  but she 's had no excuse for not coming to see me . She knew where I was . JULIEN I 'll tell her . MRS . PRICE Tell her to drop me a postal making a date . JULIEN I will . Good-bye . Give my regards to your husband . MRS . PRICE I will . And  --  and  --  She hesitates , a little embarrassed . And you tell Edith I said not to mind what the newspapers say . Nobody does . JULIEN Airily . Oh  --  that ! He waves his hand . She 's much too sensible . MRS . PRICE Well , I hope so . But knowing how foolish she always was over you  --  I  --  it worried me . I  --  JULIEN Good-bye . MRS . PRICE Who can not delay any longer . Good-bye . With another reluctant , curious glance about , she goes . JULIEN closes the door after her almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picks up his book , lights another cigarette , and settles himself to read again . OSCAR enters , from the studio . He carries a large manuscript envelope and looks as though he had just dressed . His hat is in his hand  --  and a coat over his arm. p. 51 OSCAR Bon jour  --  mon cher Julien . JULIEN Looking up . Oh , hello . Going ? OSCAR Sitting down . Starting . However  --  there 's always time for a cigarette . Got one ? JULIEN Here . He throws a box . OSCAR catches it . Got matches ? OSCAR Think so . He finds matches and lights a cigarette . Here . . . . Looking toward the windows , as he tosses the cigarettes back to JULIEN . By yonder street lamps I take it that the day begins to wane . JULIEN Yes . It 's almost time for breakfast . I hope you feel more like it than I do . OSCAR I never felt more like coffee , eggs , and bacon in my life  --  not even at five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had anything ? JULIEN No . OSCAR Edith not about ? JULIEN Very much so . OSCAR Cross ? p. 52 JULIEN Worse than that . Hell-of-a-mess . OSCAR Jealous ? Some girl  --  or something ? JULIEN " Some girl " is right . I 'm distinguished for life . Dahlgren 's after a divorce . Hester and I are all over the newspapers . OSCAR Edith 's not cut up about it , is she ? Did she say much ? JULIEN She said nothing . That 's worse . OSCAR But did n't you have it out with her  --  that you were both to be perfectly free  --  and all that ? JULIEN Oh , yes . OSCAR Well , if she understood what was going on she has n't anything to kick about now . She ca n't blame you because Hester 's husband got nasty . JULIEN Women are n't very logical . OSCAR You ought n't to have gone to Palm Beach with Hester . JULIEN She had half a dozen other people staying at the cottage all the time . OSCAR Yes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You were the fixture . That was a fool thing for you to do . JULIEN I know that now . . . . p. 53 OSCAR I think she 's in love with you . . . . JULIEN No , thank God . She 's not . She 's never been in love with anyone . OSCAR Women are funny . Olga wants me to marry her . JULIEN Good heavens  --  why ? OSCAR shrugs . It seems very difficult to dodge the " grand passion " these days . OSCAR It will be worse in about two weeks . April will be here then . However , it 's not the " grand passion " with Olga . It 's plain Russian-Jewess business sense . JULIEN Do n't you flatter yourself ? OSCAR No . . . . I 've got talent . And if she married me she 'd make me turn out a short story every month . Then she 'd get them sold . She says she 's discovered that a woman needs both money and a marriage certificate in America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! But during the pause that follows he is not so sure , adding humorously . Oh  --  well , perhaps . I 'm fond of Olga . JULIEN There are worse things than having a wife . And then children are always rather wonderful . p. 54 OSCAR Then , of course , in a case like yours a wife 's a protection . Hester Dahlgren ca n't expect you to marry her . That would be awful , would n't it ? I suppose she 'll have no money . . . . JULIEN Pretty awful . OSCAR Well , I 'm off . Wo n't you come along ? JULIEN Where are you going ? OSCAR Anywhere  --  where there 's coffee . We might try Olga 's first . . . . If she 's amiable she 'll fix us up . JULIEN No , she might play something . He puts his hand to his head . OSCAR Oh , well  --  somewhere else , then  --  unless  --  He looks about . JULIEN We 'd better not mess things up around here . Edith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called us each time and each time we said we were getting up  --  OSCAR You mean you said it . I never rallied once . JULIEN And then again when I did get up  --  about an hour ago . But I happened to see the paper first  --  and lost my appetite . So  --  p. 55 OSCAR Then we might as well travel  --  unless you want to lie around here . He rises . JULIEN No , I 'll go . OSCAR If we run into Olga later be sort of tactful . JULIEN She knows you had some sort of party last night . OSCAR Oh , we 'll admit that . Only we 'll slow up on the details . Also she does n't know about the check I got for those two poems yesterday . JULIEN Too trivial to mention , I suppose . OSCAR You can laugh . But you 've got a wife . It 's all right to tell a wife the brutal truth , but you 've got to go sort of easy with your lady-love . You know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't have to stand for any of that nonsense from Olga . OSCAR Do n't I ? Olga 's mad , of course  --  but not every woman  --  no matter how much sense she has about other things  --  knows how to stable a man properly . And Olga 's as clever as Edith about that . JULIEN That 's true . Heaven only knows how they manage  --  Edith particularly  --  on what she has to spend ,  --  but . . . let 's get along . I 'll get my things . He goes into the studio  --  and returns immediately with his hat and coat and stick. p. 56 OSCAR By the way , when are you going to get to work ? JULIEN It will surprise you very much  --  but  --  tomorrow . OSCAR Cynically . We 'll see  --  The door opens as they go toward it , and EDITH and JANET enter , several small bundles in their arms . EDITH wears a short blue skirt , a white blouse , a boyish jersey , and a tam on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jersey over her blue serge frock . JULIEN halts , greeting them . JULIEN Hello . EDITH AND JANET Together . Hello . JULIEN To JANET . You do n't get by , young lady , with a cool , airy " hello " to me . JANET That 's not all of it . She holds up her face to be kissed . JULIEN I should say it is n't ! He catches her up in his arms and then stands her quickly but tenderly on a chair . Have you been weighed lately ? JANET No . She is smiling and happy . EDITH puts her bundles on the table . OSCAR follows her. p. 57 OSCAR Thanks for putting me up every other night or two  --  I suppose I should say every other day or two  --  like this . JULIEN To JANET , who is standing on a chair with her arms around his neck . I 've got a secret to tell you . JANET What ? He whispers in her ear . She laughs and whispers back . Then they kiss . OSCAR Continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breakfast and failed to keep either  --  or even send our regrets . I apologise . EDITH Did you want another now ? She smiles absently . OSCAR A thousand thanks  --  but  --  JULIEN Come along , Oscar . To EDITH , as he sets JANET back down on the floor . We 're off for a walk . EDITH Will you be back for dinner ? JULIEN I do n't know . Do n't bother about me . But I 've just made an engagement with a certain young lady to take her to a picture show tonight  --  if you 'll permit such a dissipation . p. 58 EDITH If she 's home by half-past nine I think she might go . JULIEN Then that 's settled , Janet . Have n't I a model child , Oscar ? She 's never said a " cunning " thing in all her prim , quaint little life . . . . Good-bye , darling ! Again he kisses her  --  nods to EDITH and goes . OSCAR Peace be on the household ! A bientt , mes enfants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gathering up the packages . Do you want me to put the butter in the refrigerator , mother ? She has picked up a bag and peered into it . EDITH Yes , darling , you can help me put all these things away  --  and then , if you 're to go to the picture show tonight you must go in the bedroom and shut the door and study until dinner-time . JANET Ca n't I study in father 's studio ? Father does n't mind if I sit at his desk . I 'll only turn on one light . EDITH It 's rather cold in there . Besides , I have to clean it up . JANET I 'll keep my sweater on . And all you have to do is to fold up the bed-clothes and put the day-covers on the couches . I 'll do that . It wo n't take a minute . p. 59 EDITH Very well . Put these things away and then come back and get your books . JANET Thanks , mother . She insists upon kissing her . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , and JANET goes out at the right with the packages . EDITH takes off her tam , and picks it and JANET 'S up from a chair where it has fallen . She takes them into the bedroom and then returns , a tissue-wrapped package in her hands . She opens it and takes out a bit of pink organdie upon which she prepares to sew . JANET returns . JANET Coming close to EDITH . Why do n't you come to the picture show , too , mother ? EDITH I 've something else to do . JANET After meditating a moment  --  speaking wistfully . Father 's awfully nice , mother , when you get to know him well . EDITH I 'm sure he is , darling . I 'm glad you 've got to know him well . JANET But he 's not any nicer than you . I like you both exactly alike . I like you both all there is to like . EDITH Suddenly putting an arm about her and drawing her close , kisses her , speaking softly . Who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JANET Smiling at their joke . Janet May Fields is Mrs. Edith Fields ' blessed comfort . EDITH That 's right . Now run along , Janet May Fields . JANET goes to the bookcases and takes out a small stack of books , pencils , tablets , etc . Then she starts out at the right . JANET Call me if you want anything , mother . EDITH nods and JANET goes , closing the door behind her . Almost at the same instant there is a knock on the hall door . EDITH goes , listlessly . EDITH Oh , Mr. Stewart ! STEWART Hello  --  may we come in  --  EDITH Of course  --  He enters with a woman , veiled and magnificently dressed . STEWART I 've brought Mrs. Dahlgren , Mrs. Fields ,  --  at her request  --  very much at her request . His voice is light but serious . EDITH is amazed and a little stern . MRS . DAHLGREN laughs and speaks in an easy , rich voice . MRS . DAHLGREN How do you do . . . There really did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come straight up and knock . How do you ever manage to say " not at home " ? p. 61 EDITH We do n't . MRS . DAHLGREN That 's probably very fortunate for me . Or else  --  She changes the subject quickly . Poor Teddy Stewart is miserable . He did n't want to bring me without a warning . But I knew that he knew you and  --  She again changes the subject , addressing STEWART . You promised me ten minutes alone with Mrs. Fields , Teddy . STEWART Very well . I 'll go down and wait in the motor . Then I want a moment or two with her myself . He goes over to EDITH , and takes her hand . Au revoir . . . . There are times when we all skate on thin ice , Mrs. Fields . Mrs. Dahlgren is an expert . I 'm not . But I hope that you wo n't be sorry we came . I think that she wants to suggest something that is for your ultimate happiness as well as her own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , painfully awkward and dumb . MRS . DAHLGREN lifts her veil , looks about , and makes herself comfortable in the big chair near the doorway to the studio . She pulls off her gloves , and finds a cigarette with such deliberation that EDITH comes to a halt behind the other big chair by the table and addresses her with desperate uneasiness. p. 62 EDITH Had n't you better tell me what you came for ? MRS . DAHLGREN Pardon me . I was just looking round . Rooms always interest me . EDITH We do n't have to beat about the bush , do we ? MRS . DAHLGREN Certainly not . . . . But she continues in the same irrelevant tone . I 've always wondered what sort of person you were , Mrs. Fields . Of course , Julien 's told me something . Men always like to talk about one woman to another . I suppose he 's told you a good bit about me . Has n't he , now ? We might as well be honest with each other . EDITH We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? EDITH Or the names of any of the other women  --  MRS . DAHLGREN Oh ! Is n't that a little catty ? EDITH Is it ? You knew there were other women , of course ? As you say  --  we might as well be honest . MRS . DAHLGREN Uncomfortably . Men are such cads ! EDITH If you do n't mind  --  I 'm waiting to hear what you wanted to say to me. p. 63 MRS . DAHLGREN You 're one of those very direct persons , I see . Direct people , to me , are like houses set close to the road . Now I am like a house behind all sorts of hedges and trees  --  approached by a long , winding poplar-bordered avenue . . . . Do you understand what I mean ? At all ? EDITH Gravely . I think I might understand if I could keep my mind on what you are saying . But I 've a good many thoughts of my own today  --  and when I think I 'm listening to someone  --  I suddenly find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Touching her head at the back . Then she continues . If you had come any other time  --  yesterday , or the day before , or the day before that  --  I might have been able to imagine some reason for it . But now that the cat 's out of the bag I ca n't see how anything I can do can help matters for either of us . So  --  ? MRS . DAHLGREN Suddenly becoming business-like and alert . The cat may be out of the bag , as you say  --  but it has n't got away yet . And that 's what I want to prevent . I do n't want to be divorced . In the first place , I do n't believe in divorce  --  EDITH No ? Is there anything that you do believe in ? Surely you do not believe in marriage . p. 64 MRS . DAHLGREN Oh , but I do ! We ca n't all be good wives and good husbands  --  but marriage is so correct  --  so absolutely necessary . I believe every woman should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You look astonished . Do n't you believe in marriage ? EDITH Not when it means shutting one 's eyes for fear of what one is going to see . MRS . DAHLGREN How quaint ! Shutting one 's eyes is an art , my dear . I suppose there 's no use trying to make you see that  --  but that 's the only way one can stay married . Most attractive wives have their  --  little temptations  --  and all men . . . . Do n't you know that every woman , practically , goes through sometime what you 're going through today ? EDITH I do n't believe that  --  not what I 'm going through . Her tone is significant . MRS . DAHLGREN Uneasily . Oh , well , of course , there are different ways of taking things . But surely you knew  --  something ? EDITH Yes , I knew something . A pause falls between them . MRS . DAHLGREN moves restlessly . EDITH is motionless behind the chair , staring at her. p. 65 MRS . DAHLGREN Nervously . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . May I smoke ? EDITH Ignoring her first remark . There are matches on that shelf  --  to your left . MRS . DAHLGREN Shortly . Thanks . She lights her cigarette , and begins abruptly . It 's all strange to me  --  the way you feel about this sort of thing , evidently . I have a motto that I made myself  --  " Take everything exactly as if it happened every day . " It 's not a bad way of doing . One gets on very well by taking whatever happens casually . . . . I said I did n't want to be divorced . I do n't . My husband is up in the air and has done what he 's threatened to do a hundred times , at last . He 's sued . I do n't believe he 'll go through with it  --  not if you do n't get up in the air , too  --  and start divorcing Julien . EDITH Oh ! MRS . DAHLGREN I came to try to persuade you that it would be silly to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that you ought to set Julien free so that he could marry me  --  after all this talk . p. 66 EDITH No . I do n't believe that I 've thought of you , at all . Or of him . MRS . DAHLGREN Sympathetically . I understand . You were thinking of your child . EDITH Coldly . No , I 've been thinking of myself . There is another pause . MRS . DAHLGREN puts out her cigarette before speaking . MRS . DAHLGREN And what do you think you are going to do ? EDITH Decisively . That will concern only Julien and me . MRS . DAHLGREN Getting up , impatiently . But , do n't you see , whatever you do must concern me , too ! If you sue for a divorce , that will make my husband sure he was right . At present all he knows is that everything looks wrong  --  but he knows , too , that it 's like me to have everything looking wrong , when it 's really all right . He 's very wobbly since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . He 's fond of me . . . . I amuse him . But  --  if you 're going to do stunts , too , he 'll have to go through with it . Only I do n't think that would be quite fair of you  --  because Julien  --  she hesitates and then comes out with it  --  Julien told me you were n't jealous  --  that you knew he was interested in someone else  --  and that it did n't make any difference . p. 67 EDITH Quietly . You were very credulous  --  even I would never have believed that  --  and I 'm not nearly so experienced as you . MRS . DAHLGREN But why not ? I did n't know you . And I did know that Walter Greenough was here all the time . Naturally I supposed  --  EDITH Interrupting with a gesture . Let me get that straight . . . . She thinks an instant , and then continues , her voice amused and bitter , and then decisive . I see . . . naturally . . . . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get a divorce . MRS . DAHLGREN Oh ! Thank heavens ! But  --  She is suddenly wary . If my husband should try to get you as a witness  --  EDITH I do n't believe that he will need me  --  MRS . DAHLGREN But if he does , you 'll say that you never objected to our  --  friendship  --  ? She halts over the word . And that you knew all about it ? EDITH You 've put it very well for me . I 'll remember the way you 've worded it . I never objected  --  and I did know all about it . . . . p. 68 MRS . DAHLGREN You are a brick ! EDITH Your ten minutes must be up . She goes deliberately to the door and opens it . MRS . DAHLGREN Oh , I see  --  you want me to go , evidently . Are n't you going to let me thank you ? EDITH That is n't necessary . Good-bye . MRS . DAHLGREN Opposite EDITH near the doorway . Good-bye . And you 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will always give you a wonderful weapon against Julien  --  that you knew and did n't make a fuss . If only I could get something on my husband  --  but poor Willy never looks at another woman ! And remember my advice , my dear  --  it 's the advice of a woman of the world , remember . Stay married . Once is enough . If you ca n't make the first marriage go you 're not likely to have better luck with the second  --  or the third . Besides getting divorced and remarried all the time is so dgag . Do n't you agree ? EDITH With a flicker of amused and bitter irony . Frightfully dgag , Mrs. Dahlgren . . . . Good-bye . Both hands are behind her and her attitude forbids further conversation. p. 69 MRS . DAHLGREN Good-bye . I 'm not sorry I came  --  although you seem so  --  so hostile . I suppose Teddy Stewart will want to come up now . I hope no reporters will see me outside in the motor . EDITH I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been here  --  and gone . But if Mr. Stewart does n't mind I 'd rather see him some other time . MRS . DAHLGREN I 'm glad . I hate waiting . I 'll tell him . Good-bye . EDITH closes the door after MRS . DAHLGREN . She moves about the room , making a nervous , absent-minded inspection . She straightens the books on the shelves  --  and finds a stitch needed in the lamp-shade . She chooses her thread carefully from a sewing-box and repairs the shade  --  lifting it nervously from the lamp . Then she lights two lamps on the wall , carefully examining their shades . She is almost like a busy , frantic insect hurrying in one direction and then another . JANET enters . EDITH twitches nervously at the unexpected opening of the door . EDITH Seeing JANET , and relaxing . Oh  --  ! JANET You 're terribly jumpy today , mother . EDITH Am I ? Well  --  I thought you were studying ? p. 70 JANET What time is it ? EDITH Indicating a little clock on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see . JANET In a disappointed tone . Oh ! EDITH What time is it ? JANET Only ten minutes after five . I thought it must be half-past six , anyway . EDITH You have n't finished getting your lessons , have you ? JANET No , but  --  EDITH You 'd better go back , then , and study until you have . JANET All right . . . . She hesitates . You do n't think father will forget about the picture show , do you ? EDITH He often forgets , does n't he ? Do n't be disappointed if he does . JANET But father never means to forget . She goes over to the window and stands a moment and then cries out happily . He 's not forgetting ! He 's coming across the square now  --  with Olga and Oscar . There is a knock on the door . EDITH opens it . GREENOUGH is there. p. 71 GREENOUGH Hello . EDITH Hello . Come in . GREENOUGH Entering . I could n't resist stopping a moment . . . . Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JANET Fine . To her mother . I guess I 'd better go back and study now . EDITH I think you had . To GREENOUGH . She has some lessons to be learned . GREENOUGH That 's hard luck  --  is n't it , at a time when you and your mother might come for a ride with me ? JANET Going . Oh , but I 'm going to a picture show with father after dinner . So I do n't mind . GREENOUGH I see . That 's different . JANET At the door , to GREENOUGH . Good-bye . GREENOUGH Good-bye . JANET goes . The door closes after her . EDITH Wo n't you sit down ? p. 72 GREENOUGH If you will . They sit  --  he on the sofa  --  she opposite on the other side of the table . A pause falls . He begins recklessly . I do n't know what I 'm doing here . She looks at him , but does not speak . He continues recklessly . This is one day when I might have had the decency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want anyone about today . EDITH It does n't seem to matter much whether anybody 's about , or not . GREENOUGH I saw the papers . . . . With sudden compassion . Tell me , Edith , are you very much cut up ? Does this thing hit you as hard as I 'm afraid it does ? EDITH I do n't know how hard it 's hitting me . GREENOUGH Getting up and walking about . I can see that it hurts  --  that it hurts damnably hard . It does  --  does n't it ? EDITH Bending her head , nodding , barely able to speak . Oh , yes . GREENOUGH Coming to a halt beside her chair . And here I am  --  so damned much in love with you that I could kill anybody  --  even another man  --  for making you suffer one single instant . Yes , here I am , up against something that I ca n't do a single thing about ! . . . Absolutely helpless to help you . . . . You know , Edith , love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man feel like this . I 'm not thinking of myself at all . Not now . The door opens noisily , and JULIEN , OSCAR and OLGA enter . There is something half-modish about OLGA now . Her wild hair seems to be less eccentric and she has acquired smart shoes and a smart serge frock . She wears no hat , and a short , shabby cape , but she strides about with a certain style and with the assurance of a person who knows she is getting somewhere . GREENOUGH moves away from EDITH 's chair and makes himself as amiable and impersonal as possible to the others. p. 73 OLGA Gaily , first to EDITH and then to GREENOUGH . Hello . . . . Hello . . . . OSCAR and JULIEN each toss a greeting at him . EDITH Hello . GREENOUGH How do you do ? He nods to the men . OSCAR goes to EDITH . JULIEN busies himself in the back of the room . OLGA goes , with a certain impudence , for GREENOUGH . OSCAR To EDITH . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me , my rich friend , why never you keep your promise to come to hear me play ? GREENOUGH I 've been intending to . . . . OLGA But the intention only gets one nowhere . You should . . . OSCAR To EDITH . It was discovered with regret at the very entrance to a tavern that neither Julien nor I had been to our banker today . EDITH Oh  --  so you have n't had your breakfast yet ? JULIEN comes and listens . Do n't you want me  --  ? She looks toward JULIEN. p. 74 JULIEN Interrupting . No , no . Do n't bother . Not again . We 'll make ourselves some coffee  --  OLGA Catching the drift of the conversation and speaking across to EDITH . Julien means that I will make it for them . That was why they invite me here when I meet them in the Square . They are very , very helpless . OSCAR And Olga is very , very helpful when a man 's starving . You do n't think there 's an egg anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . EDITH Look in the ice-box , Olga . OLGA Then come , mes enfants  --  I will not go alone . If I am to make coffee for you , you must make conversation for me  --  They move toward the door . She continues half in jest , half in earnest.  --  and it must be very good conversation if you are to make me forget that I am very , very cross . Where do you think they were last night , Edith , that Oscar was afraid to come home ? EDITH I do n't know . OSCAR I 'll tell you . We sat up most of the night with Jack McBurney and half a dozen others  --  OLGA Girls ? p. 75 OSCAR No  --  all men . And we all drank too much and talked too loud and stayed too long . Then we went out and rode on a milk-wagon up Fifth Avenue to the Park . And in the Park we watched the day arrive and discussed the Soul of Man and prayed to the Rising Sun for just one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't get . Do n't you believe me ? OLGA With a shrug . Perhaps . . . . It may be true  --  it is very like you  --  To GREENOUGH . They are what you call " loafers " : anything they may do  --  except the work . But they do not bore me and they have something of the spirit . That is saying much for any man . Shall you desire coffee , too , monsieur ? My coffee is such as you often do not taste . GREENOUGH Thanks , very much  --  but I 'm going in a moment . OLGA And you , Edith ? EDITH I think not . If I want any , I 'll come and get it . OSCAR Placing his arm about OLGA and leading her toward the kitchen . Then ho ! for the kitchenette and the shining lyrical kettle ! Coming , Julien ? JULIEN Quietly . Yes , I 'm coming . He follows them with a backward look at GREENOUGH and EDITH . See you later , I suppose . He goes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 76 GREENOUGH Rather awkwardly . I suppose I ought to go . . . I suppose I ought not to stay . . . I suppose you do n't care whether I go or stay ? But  --  in God 's name , Edith , have n't you had enough ? Are n't you tired of this ? Is there anything more that a man can do to a woman to humiliate her and distress her  --  ? When I saw the papers this morning , I said , " This ends it . " And it does end it , does n't it ? EDITH I suppose you 're thinking that I ought to leave him ? GREENOUGH What else is there to do ? EDITH And get a divorce  --  like her husband 's doing  --  I suppose ? GREENOUGH Of course . . . and I 'm not one who believes in divorces usually . . . . And I 'm not thinking of myself , either  --  or what your being free might mean to me , some day . I tell you I 'm thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's meant to you . But I 've been watching ever since he came home . I know how things have gone from day to day  --  and I tell you , Edith , I swear to you that I do n't believe the woman lives who could be married to Julien Fields  --  and be happy . There 's nothing in it for you , my dear ,  --  nothing but a miserable half-squalid Bohemian existence  --  that 's against all your clean , orderly instincts  --  here  --  in a home that is n't a home  --  as a slave to a husband who is n't a husband . Life owes you something more  --  and you owe it to yourself to take it . p. 77 EDITH Vehemently . And do n't you suppose that I 've said all this to myself a hundred times ! GREENOUGH Then if you see it , too  --  EDITH With a sob . I do see it ! There is a sharp pause . Then she breaks out passionately . But there 's some more than just that ! I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you as  --  EDITH Yes , he 's right . In his mind he 's right . That 's what is so important . It may be all wrong in another way . And it 's been hard to bear  --  and is hard to bear  --  as far as I 'm concerned  --  all these new ways of his . But I 'm willing to bear them because I know there 's something very fine back of all his nonsense and his cruelty and his idleness and his selfishness . I know there 's something he 's been trying to make me understand  --  a little bit . It 's that he 's going through something , and he 's got to go through it to get where he wants to be . GREENOUGH I see what you mean . You think this is a phase  --  that he 'll settle down and have a real career some day . Well , he 's paying too big a price for it . And you 're paying too big a price . p. 78 EDITH It 's not the career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something more important that he 's hunting  --  and that he 'll surely find . It 's something of the spirit  --  like Olga said . It 's something that would be like religion if religion meant doing everything you want to do  --  and laughing about it  --  and learning from it  --  instead of not doing it . . . . Do you see ? GREENOUGH I see  --  but not with your idealism . I see only a young man with no great talent  --  idling away  --  but  --  Pausing . There 's no use talking . You love him . And no matter what he does you 're not willing to blame him . You 'd forgive him for anything . EDITH I can see how you think that . But I do n't think it 's true . There have been times when I 've wanted to run out of this house , screaming , and I would n't have cared where I went either  --  to the river  --  anywhere  --  GREENOUGH Turning to her suddenly . Edith  --  ! EDITH Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes , and so terribly ashamed  --  that I wanted to run where it was dark and cold . . . . But that 's over , thank God . Now I know that what I must have is patience . . . . Patience . . . . She is silent for an instant . Then she speaks suddenly out of a reverie . Poor Julien ! I wish I were n't so heavy-hearted all the time ! But when I try to be gay  --  I  --  I 'm so stupid about it . GREENOUGH draws his hand sharply across his eyes and then goes to the window , looking out . EDITH continues presently , humbly , but with shining eyes . I 'm not clever . . . . You say Julien is idling away his time . That 's true . But I 've worked all my life and I do n't know that keeping oneself busy is such a wonderful thing . I often wonder what he must be thinking of when he lies on the sofa , there , smoking . I 've a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have to be doing little things all the time . As for the rest of his faults  --  I do n't deny them . But when I go to places and see other women with other men  --  men who look tame and sleek and contented  --  I think of Julien , and I 'm glad he 's not like them  --  whether they 're good husbands or not . At least there 's something very free about everything he says and does  --  and I 'm sure it 's a very fine thing for a man to be free , that way , whether it makes a woman happy or not . Then she adds , more to herself than to him . Yes , I 'm sure that it 's a fine thing for a man to be free to think and act as it suits him  --  whether it makes some woman unhappy or not . p. 79 GREENOUGH Coming back toward her . And what do you think your husband would say or do if you chose to be as free as he does ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ought both to be free . He does n't think our being married to each other ought to make the least difference  --  to either of us . Julien 's fair . GREENOUGH Is he ? Suddenly he puts his hand in his coat pocket . Are you brave enough to prove to yourself whether he 's fair or not ? She looks amazed . He continues , sternly . Are you ? EDITH Why should I prove what I know ? GREENOUGH If you 're afraid  --  ? EDITH Afraid ? GREENOUGH I think you ought to get rid of him . Now , when your opportunity is here at your hand ready-made . You 've a lot of ideas about him that wo n't stand testing out . I 'm going to a family dinner tonight . It 's one of my cousins ' birthdays . I 'm very fond of her , and today I went through some things of my mother 's that I have at the bank  --  looking for an old miniature that I knew Alice , my cousin , had always wanted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was this box among several others . . . My mother had very beautiful hands . She was fond of wearing bracelets . Some of these were old-fashioned , some quite new when she died  --  five years ago . They made me think of your hands . I brought them away  --  on a purely fantastic impulse . He has given her the box , which she has opened. p. 80 EDITH Oh ! She stares at them . They 're very beautiful , are n't they ? He watches her a moment  --  and then she starts to give them back . GREENOUGH No , I want you to put them on . EDITH But I  --  GREENOUGH I 'm not asking you to keep them . Please . EDITH But why  --  ? GREENOUGH Let me help . . . . Please . He takes the box from her hands , places it on the table , and puts half a dozen glittering bracelets on each of her arms . There . . . . You see , some will go on without being unclasped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up so that the light flashes from the jewels . Oh , but  --  how fine I am ! Oh , look ! Her gestures flash them back and forth . She laughs and stops short . Oh , but  --  how silly they make me ! For a moment I felt like a child  --  so excited ! Please help me take them off . GREENOUGH Please keep them on . EDITH Oh , no . Certainly not . She is decisive. p. 81 GREENOUGH I wonder what your husband would say if he saw them on your arms ? EDITH I think it would hurt him very much to see them on my arms , and to think what he 'd have to think , but I know that he 'd say I had just as much a right to them as he 's had to the things he 's done . And I think  --  she grows a little excited again  --  that I 'll let him see them there  --  if you 'll lend them to me  --  for it might be very good for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , and see . But I think you 'll find  --  He pauses sharply  --  then speaks wearily . I 'll go now . Probably I 've said exactly the wrong things  --  and I thought I had my arguments all arranged in invincible formation . At any rate , it 's something to see you now and then . You 're very good . . . . Life would be a very simple thing today , would n't it  --  if you cared for me as I care for you ? EDITH There 'd still be Julien  --  and I 'd still think him right  --  in all the dreadful things he 's done  --  whether I cared for someone else or not  --  and I 'd still be a faithful wife as long as I felt  --  as I do  --  that he does still need me . Good-bye . She has suddenly forgotten the bracelets. p. 82 GREENOUGH Quietly . Good-bye , my dear . You do n't rail at your " yoke of inauspicious stars "  --  so all I can do is to bear mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and goes in silence . EDITH stands still an instant , then goes into her bedroom at the back , closing the door behind her . The stage is empty for a moment , then JULIEN enters , two cups of coffee on a small tray . It is evident that he has been expecting to find someone . However , seeing no one , he sets the tray down by the table , makes himself comfortable , and prepares to drink the coffee himself . EDITH enters . She wears her cap and her sweater . As she closes the door behind her JULIEN looks about . JULIEN Oh . . . . Going out ? EDITH Yes . It 's time to think about dinner . Olga and Oscar will stay , I suppose ? JULIEN I suppose so  --  if you ask them . EDITH You can ask them . I 'll go to the market and get some more things . JULIEN Olga sent you and Greenough this coffee . She thought you might want it , after all . EDITH He 's gone  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 83 JULIEN I 'll drink it , then . She starts toward the door , but turns back . EDITH Julien  --  JULIEN Yes ? EDITH You wo n't forget about the picture show , will you ? Janet 's counting on it . JULIEN I do n't know why I mentioned it . I ought to go to sleep instead of going out . EDITH But you promised . JULIEN Oh , I 'll take her . I do n't like to disappoint Janet . You know that . EDITH comes away from the door and hovers near the table . EDITH Timidly . Julien  --  JULIEN Well , what is it ? EDITH Do n't you think  --  if you come home early tonight  --  and sleep well  --  that you might start in tomorrow morning and do those drawings for your old firm  --  JULIEN God ! How I hate that job . EDITH I know . But we 're spending such a lot , Julien . If you could only make something now and then , so that everything we had saved would n't go  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . You know that . For God 's sake do n't keep worrying about money . He drinks his coffee . She comes and sits in the chair across the room from him . He eyes her uncomfortably . I thought you were going to the market . EDITH I am . But she does not move . JULIEN Finishing his coffee , and lighting a cigarette . Well , what have you got on your mind ? EDITH I do n't know how to say just what I would like to say . JULIEN I suppose you 're thinking of that stuff in the papers today . Well  --  everything was all twisted  --  and exaggerated . But  --  suppose we forget it ? It 's a mess  --  and I 'm sorry I ever got into it , but  --  you 'll forget it , wo n't you , Edith ? EDITH It is n't that . JULIEN No ? What , then ? She is frowning in her concentration . With a sudden laugh . To watch you think is like watching a lot of fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world is worth all that effort , Edith . Whatever it is , do n't bother . p. 85 EDITH As if she had n't heard . Julien  --  JULIEN Well  --  go on . EDITH Julien , you 've talked a lot about freedom . And experience . . . . And doing as one wants to do . JULIEN Yes  --  I suppose I 've talked more than was really necessary about a thing that most men take for granted . EDITH And when you said it was all right for you to go where you pleased and do what you pleased  --  with other women  --  JULIEN You exaggerate the other women , Edith . You always have . They were simply incidents . EDITH Perhaps . But you did mean that I had the same right to have the same sort of incidents in my life ? JULIEN You ! He suddenly laughs . What are you driving at ? EDITH You said we were both to be free . JULIEN Poor Edith ! Do n't tell me you 've been having your little temptations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravity causes him to stop smiling , but he still takes her very lightly . Now this begins to sound serious . . . . I 'm afraid you 've been letting Greenough really make love to you . p. 86 EDITH I 'm afraid I have . She lifts her hands and holds them out so that the bracelets catch the full light beneath his eyes . He bends over sharply to look at them , as she adds simply . Does it matter ? JULIEN Good heavens ! Those things are worth a fortune  --  if  --  Did Greenough really give them to you ? She nods " yes . " He looks at her with a slowly changing expression as she sits staring at her lifted hands in the lamplight . I ca n't believe it  --  of you . A bit unsteadily . By George  --  women always fool men . Even you ! With an effort . Fair . . . ? Then , recklessly . Why not ? Sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose . I 've always said that . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EDITH Shall I take them off , now ? JULIEN Take them off ? Why ? She does n't answer at once . He continues easily . You spoke of being fair . Well , I hope I 've proved to you that I meant what I said about freedom . I 've not asked for anything I 'm not willing to let you have . . . . I  --  I congratulate you . As a woman you 're a great success . I hope you get another dozen or two like them . They make your hands look very charming . She still does n't answer . Then suddenly she stands up , blazing. p. 87 EDITH Fair ! But this  --  this is  --  horrible ! A sob tears from her lips . JULIEN Are you crazy ? Did n't I say what you expected me to say ? EDITH Moaning . Oh , but this is the end ! This is the end ! JULIEN The end ! Are you crazy ? EDITH Starting toward the door . The end ! I 'm going now  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JULIEN What do you mean ? Are you crazy ? Going where ? EDITH I do n't know . . . . Oh , Julien ! He takes her wrists and pulls her down toward the couch . She is sobbing . JULIEN You little idiot  --  hush ! What in the name of God is the matter with you ? EDITH Holding out her hands  --  still in his grip . Do n't you know ? You should have torn them off ! You should have beaten me ! But you did n't care ! You did n't care . He drops her hands quickly . She goes to the door . She opens it , and turns back  --  no longer sobbing , but wide-eyed with grief . I do n't know what you 'll make of yourself  --  but now I know what it is you 'd be willing to let me make of myself . And that 's what I ca n't bear  --   --  that you 're willing to  --  see me  --  that low ! She goes , quickly . The door slams behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room , her books under her arms . She goes and arranges them very neatly on a shelf and then comes to her father and touches his hand. p. 88 JULIEN Oh  --  hello . JANET I 've got all my lessons , father . JULIEN Have you ? That 's good . JANET We can go to the picture show now . JULIEN Yes , yes  --  so we can . JANET How 's your headache , father ? . . . Does it hurt  --  still ? JULIEN It 's all right . He moves impatiently to the window . JANET follows him , slipping her hand into his . JANET Do you think it 's going to rain , father ? JULIEN Perhaps . There is silence for an instant . JANET Excitedly . That 's mother running ! She 's crossing on the other side of the Square . See ! Where 's she going , father ? Where 's she going ! Running like that ? JULIEN God knows ! . . . CURTAIN @x Three years later . A spring afternoon . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park . At the back there is a row of windows with a small balcony just outside . Window boxes of flowers brilliantly in bloom have just been placed there . A very blue sky built about with white clouds is the background for a radiant glimpse of the budding trees and the towers beyond the Park . At one side there is a fireplace , in which a fire has been laid but not lighted . Beyond it is a doorway to another room . Opposite there is a wider doorway to the hall . There are several cases of books , and delightful pieces of painted furniture . The general impression is that of a delicate but luxurious setting for a woman of sensitive taste . LAURA , a maid  --  a pleasant-looking , intelligent young woman  --  is talking to a young man who is there , obviously , on business . He is not exactly shabby , but one is not surprised to find that he is a florist 's assistant . LAURA Indicating the tulips . I never saw a finer lot , Mr. Knight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you ever did . And they look very handsome grouped like that . LAURA You do n't think it 's too early to put them outside ? p. 90 MR . KNIGHT If it had been put up to me I 'd have said " wait one more week . " Even tulips do n't like the nights too cool , but your lady was so eager to have them right off that I figured out I would n't get any thanks by saying anything more than I did against it . People do n't want too much advice , I 've found . LAURA That 's true enough of most , but not so much of her as you might think . Mrs. Fields is very willing to hear both sides always , even when it means that she 's to be disappointed in something she 's set her heart on . She 'd have minded what you said about waiting a little longer if she had n't been so excited and happy about her little girl . MR . KNIGHT That 's what she said to me herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " so it 'll look gay and beautiful when she comes home . " Well , it 's better than an even chance she 's got with her window boxes . The weather 's been warm for ten days now , and all we can do is to hope for good luck with them . I guess I 'd better be getting along . But he does n't go . LAURA Perhaps you 'd like a cup of coffee and a bite of something to eat ? I 'm sure Mrs. Fields would like me to offer it to you  --  being as you 've been working around without stopping at all for any proper lunch since morning . p. 91 MR . KNIGHT I might rest a bit , and drink the coffee , if it 's no trouble to get , and you 've a minute to spare  --  LAURA There 's nothing to do now but listen to the telephone and the door-bell  --  and keep her from being awakened by anyone . MR . KNIGHT The way the bells have been ringing all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's true . You can understand that we  --  significantly as she lowers her voice  --  live very quiet , as a usual thing . But since the little girl 's been in the hospital it seems as if people have turned up , right and left , to show their kind feelings for the mother . And now that the danger 's all past and Miss Janet is being brought home , Mrs. Fields is like somebody who  --  who  --  she hesitates and then goes on  --  well , it expresses it to say she 's like somebody with a friendly jag on after drinking a little too much . She wants to talk to everybody . She almost wants to hug them . She heard me telling the man at the grocer 's , over the ' phone , how much better the child was  --  and got out of bed herself to thank him for asking . MR . KNIGHT I 've always thought her a very nice lady , myself , although . . . p. 92 LAURA Nods . She 's a lady in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stayed a year in a household where things were not strictly regular . MR . KNIGHT Nodding regretfully . She should appreciate you . LAURA I appreciate her . She pauses , troubled . MR . KNIGHT Of course we 're talking confidential , and if there 's anything that 's bothering you , and I could help you  --  ? LAURA No , it 's not that you can help . It 's only that a person calling himself Mr. Fields has been calling up , trying to see her . Her tone is ominous . What do you make out of that , Mr. Knight ? MR . KNIGHT Could it be  --  a husband ? What did he sound like ? LAURA Like  --  like  --  like anybody . Very dignified . Very short . And I know she has a husband  --  and that he let her have the child . A door is heard opening outside , then men 's voices . They move toward the door to the hall . There 's somebody coming in now . I guess it 's Mr. Greenough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if anything 's wanted . You do n't mind , Mr. Knight ? I 'll be with you in a minute . You know where it is ? p. 93 MR . KNIGHT I ought to  --  ought n't I ? LAURA Do n't try to pretend that you 're here often . MR . KNIGHT Boldly as they go out . If I 'm not whose fault is it ? Not mine  --  LAURA ' Ssh . . . . They go . The stage is empty for a few moments . Then GREENOUGH enters with STEWART . LAURA follows them in . LAURA Shall I light the fire , sir ? GREENOUGH Briefly . No , it 's too warm . LAURA And the windows  --  ? GREENOUGH Leave them open . To STEWART . It 's really warmer outside than in . . . . Are you thirsty ? After that walk  --  To the maid . Bring us something to drink . LAURA Yes , sir . She starts out , but turns back at his next words , spoken from the window . GREENOUGH Knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers , sir ? Yes , sir . She goes . GREENOUGH steps out upon the balcony p. 94 GREENOUGH Calling to STEWART , inside . What a day ! Then he comes back into the room , continuing . By the way , have you the afternoon papers ? STEWART I left two out in the hall . Want them ? GREENOUGH If I do I 'll get them later . I just remembered that I 'd not seen one . Nothing new , I suppose ? STEWART Stocks went down , generally , during the morning  --  then rallied  --  if that interests you . GREENOUGH It does n't . Have you been in the market lately ? STEWART Yes , unfortunately . GREENOUGH Did Uncle William decide to sell his steel , after all ? STEWART Yes  --  unfortunately . . . again . It 's gone up since . There is a bare pause . GREENOUGH Restlessly . I should think you 'd want to get out of town  --  with the weather like this . He goes and looks out of the window . STEWART Rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pretty , are n't they . . . ? There is no answer and he continues in the same casual manner . I saw Julien Fields at the hospital today . GREENOUGH looks up sharply but does not answer . LAURA enters with a bottle of whiskey and some soda and two glasses on a tray. p. 95 LAURA Is there anything else , sir ? GREENOUGH Quietly . You said Mrs. Fields was still asleep , did n't you ? LAURA Yes , sir . GREENOUGH When she awakens tell her I 'm home . LAURA Yes , sir . She goes out . GREENOUGH pours himself a drink . GREENOUGH Here you are . You like to mix your own . STEWART Thanks . He mixes himself a drink . Presently . Edith 's all in , I suppose . GREENOUGH She 's well enough now  --  only she ca n't seem to get enough sleep . It 's the reaction  --  now that everything 's all right . STEWART I suppose she went through hell . GREENOUGH I know she did . STEWART I said I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEWART He 's looking as if he 'd been through hell , too . There is an instant 's silence . GREENOUGH makes no comment . I suppose  --  after the child is brought here  --  that you 'll have to have him about , now and then . She 'll want him , and . . . It 's rather a situation , is n't it ? p. 96 GREENOUGH He ca n't come here . STEWART But  --  she 'll want him . He 's her father . GREENOUGH He ca n't come here . That 's settled . STEWART You and Edith could avoid seeing him . GREENOUGH He 's not coming . There is a pause . GREENOUGH drinks his highball . STEWART A moment ago you asked me why I did n't get away ; well , that 's what I think you ought to do . GREENOUGH does not at once answer and STEWART continues , going to the window and staring out . With the weather like this and the whole land turning green I feel that the town is very much like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when they 're clean . GREENOUGH There 's nothing to keep you from turning yourself out to pasture . STEWART No , nothing . . . . I 'll be off in a day or two , now . GREENOUGH Have you decided where to go ? STEWART The Adirondacks . Your camp . I 've invited myself . I wish you were coming along . Leave Edith here to work it out herself . That 's what she 's got to do  --  sooner or later . p. 97 GREENOUGH I almost broke your head once  --  in our nursery days  --  for interfering with something I wanted to do . But you still interfere on every possible occasion with everybody and everything . I suppose no one will ever break you of the habit . STEWART You 'll have to pardon these intrusions of mine if we 're to go on being friends as well as relatives , Walter . When a man 's headed wrong somebody 's going to tell him so . . . . And there 's one thing  --  He speaks with sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family  --  and every friend you have  --  and even men who are simply associated with you in a business way  --  had put it up to me that I ought to  --  to talk to you  --  you 'd realise that I stood by you and Edith with a good deal of delicacy . GREENOUGH Oh , yes . I can imagine that . Thanks very much . STEWART I 'm not asking for thanks . All I want is the privilege of saying to you  --  what I 'd be jolly well glad to have you say to me under the circumstances  --  that you 're not looking well , that you need a change , that you 've been through a good bit , and that you must realise that Edith has a big situation to face  --  a very trying one  --  no matter how fond she is of you  --  and that it would be a good thing for both of you if you left her alone for the next three four weeks . p. 98 GREENOUGH Where 's any situation ? I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's none so blind . . . " GREENOUGH But I can see how a sentimentalist  --  like you  --  who is always talking about the old-fashioned sanctities  --  for other people  --  might work himself up into thinking that a woman will throw over everything and go back to a miserable marriage that she ran away from years before  --  just because she and her child 's father have been watching together at the child 's bedside . . . . He laughs , but unhappily . Good God  --  that 's the sob stuff they used to make sentimental songs of ! . . . Life 's different . " Baby hands " do n't happen to , really , hold together men and women who have got through with one another , and gone different  --  and happier  --  ways for years . STEWART  --  Quietly . There 's something in what you say , of course . " Baby hands " have n't the enormous influence in real life that they 've always had in the songs of the vaudeville singers . Neither has " mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the sob stuff go down so easily  --  or they would n't keep on handing it out . But  --  Again he speaks with heat . Take the facts  --  then  --  and throw away the time-honoured sentiments . There is something damned touching about a sick child . You saw Janet  --  and all any of us could do was to go about trying to find things we could buy her  --  that she could have . If she 'd wanted the moon for a locket you 'd have managed to get it for her . Do n't you think Edith felt something of the sort ? Do n't you think she still feels . . . He pauses. p. 99 GREENOUGH  --  Almost to himself . She 'll never go back to him . I do n't care who . . . He breaks off , then begins again . He had his chance . And I 've nothing to blame myself for  --  I was on the square . I never said a word until . . . She wo n't go back to him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something in his voice makes GREENOUGH look up quickly . GREENOUGH  --  You do n't think  --  you ca n't think that she should , Walter ! STEWART  --  I do n't know . . . . GREENOUGH  --  But  --  STEWART  --  You see , after all , no matter how broadminded one is  --  or is not  --  about this sort of thing  --  he waves his hand to indicate the establishment  --  one wants things a bit more regular where a child is concerned . There 's something that Julien Fields can give his wife and daughter that you ca n't , Walter , with all your money . GREENOUGH  --  The water 's gone over the dam , Ned . . . . He drove her away . She 's not going back . p. 100 STEWART  --  Changing the subject casually . When are you going to open the house at Westbury ? GREENOUGH  --  It 's being put in order now . Edith and I are going out late this afternoon and have a look around . Then we 'll move as soon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to get her to the country as soon as possible , I suppose . GREENOUGH  --  Oh , yes , of course . But it may be two or three weeks yet . LAURA enters , a little uneasy . GREENOUGH  --  Looking up . Well ? LAURA  --  It 's a man  --  to see you , sir . GREENOUGH  --  Well , who is it ? Did n't he give his name ? LAURA  --  He said it  --  it was  --  Mr. Fields . GREENOUGH  --  After a bare pause . Take him into the library  --  and ask him to wait . LAURA  --  Yes , sir . She goes . There is a silence . Then GREENOUGH speaks sharply. p. 101 GREENOUGH  --  You know him . You always had a good deal more to say to him than I did . Will you  --  will you  --  see him for me now ? STEWART  --  Do n't you think he must have something that he wants to say to you pretty badly  --  since he 's come here  --  like this ? GREENOUGH  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's nothing I care to talk about to him . Good God ! He ca n't think he 's got anybody to blame but himself  --  can he ? STEWART  --  Very well . I 'll see him . There 's nothing you want me to say to him , is there ? GREENOUGH  --  You can tell him for me  --  you can say to him  --  that . . . But , what 's the use ? He knows as well as I do that all he can decently do , now , is to keep away . . . and he knows , of course , that there 's nothing that wo n't be done for Janet . STEWART  --  I think he appreciates it . I know he does , in fact . . . . He starts out . But I suppose the least I can do is to listen to what he has to say and make him understand your position . GREENOUGH  --  Yes . . . . He might think of that . STEWART goes . There is a long pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently. p. 102 LAURA  --  As she enters . Mrs. Fields is awake , sir ; I was just coming to tell you when I heard the bell . GREENOUGH looks about with a sudden uneasy glance . LAURA hurries on . She rang for Clara about twenty minutes ago , but I did n't happen to know it at the time . I must have been brushing up the balcony after the florist 's man had finished . I 'm sorry , sir , I  --  GREENOUGH  --  Never mind . Is William about ? LAURA  --  I think so , sir . I 'll see . GREENOUGH  --  Tell him to put some things in a bag and find out the first train I can get accommodations on  --  going to the camp . Then get them by long distance . LAURA  --  The camp , sir ? GREENOUGH  --  The caretaker  --  William will understand . LAURA  --  Very well , sir . She starts out . GREENOUGH  --  And Laura  --  LAURA  --  Yes , sir . GREENOUGH  --  If Mr. Stewart wants me I shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very well , sir . LAURA goes out in one direction ; GREENOUGH , after the slightest hesitation , in the other . There is an instant 's pause . Then LAURA returns , ushering before her OSCAR and MRS . PRICE . LAURA has in her arms two florist 's boxes that they have evidently just given her . OSCAR is very smart , with a moustache and gloves , these days , although his shirts still have the look of the Nebraska farm  --  a look that he has managed to retain by having them made of too bright-coloured linen at a fashionable shop . And his suit of rough grey tweed has undoubtedly come from the hands of an English tailor . MRS . PRICE , much prettier than one has remembered her , is also amazingly smart in a simple frock and hat . LAURA  --  If you 'll wait here , please  --  OSCAR  --  And please make a point of saying to Mrs. Fields that we 've only come to say we could n't come  --  and to ask when we may come instead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she may want you to wait  --  OSCAR  --  Briefly . That would n't be possible , today . We 're on our way to a concert . But any other time , tomorrow or the next day , that she says . p. 104 LAURA  --  Yes , sir . I 'll explain that , sir . She goes . MRS . PRICE waits for an instant for her to get out of earshot , and then turns about in amazement . MRS . PRICE  --  But why on earth did you say a thing like that ! I telephoned that we 'd be here  --  and she said she 'd love to see us ! She 's expecting us  --  ! OSCAR  --  With the manner one uses to a child . ' Ssh . . . . Tact , my dear . Tact . He indicates the hallway . There were voices in a room that we passed . And one of those voices was Julien Fields ' . MRS . PRICE  --  Oh ! OSCAR  --  Something 's going on here . Do n't you feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I did . MRS . PRICE  --  But  --  OSCAR  --  ' Ssh . . . . It behooves us to get out as delicately and as quickly as possible . She looks a little blank at this . He laughs indulgently . And that 's an awful blow to your feminine curiosity , is n't it ? MRS . PRICE  --  You need n't make fun of me . Who would n't be curious ? Are n't you ? p. 105 OSCAR  --  Absurdly and tormentingly curious . MRS . PRICE  --  Ingenuously . Then we might have hung around  --  a little while . OSCAR  --  Now that 's just the sort of thing that I 'd consider a mortal sin . She looks at him curiously . Do n't try to understand . You ca n't . MRS . PRICE  --  I wonder why I put up with you . Except that you do understand certain things about my being lonely . OSCAR  --  Pouf ! You know why you put up with me and why I put up with you . It 's springtime  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we need n't lie about it . Oh , it 's not because your husband had been so busy with his lucky inventions and his sudden flood of gold that he turned you loose with a full purse to go out and buy what you liked  --  and let it go at that . . . . It was n't because you were opulent and lonely that you waited and asked me to come to see you after you 'd come to one of my lectures . MRS . PRICE  --  If I had n't been lonely I 'd never have gone to your lecture . I did n't know it was you , anyway . I did n't know it when I read your book . I never even knew you had a last name when I used to run into you at Edith 's  --  in those days when we both lived in that dreadful little flat in Harlem . She shudders delicately. p. 106 OSCAR  --  That dreadful little flat in Harlem . He smiles and then changes the subject . Oh , I do n't doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through with that book of mine at all  --  MRS . PRICE  --  No  --  there was something about it I liked . I 've lived in a little town in Nebraska , too ; and it brought back something . You do n't give me credit for any brains  --  but I did like it . And that was why I went to hear your lecture . And that was why I asked you to come to see me . That and  --  OSCAR  --  What ?  --  go on . MRS . PRICE  --  You wo n't give me credit for having any delicacy , I suppose , but I have . I never thought of anybody really making money out of writing books  --  and I thought you might be poor still  --  and like to have some place to go . You used to always enjoy a good home dinner at Edith 's . OSCAR  --  So you thought you might give me one . I see . He stares at her , a smile playing about his lips . MRS . PRICE After a pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being loneliness . You  --  you do n't flatter yourself that I 'm in love with you , do you  --  just because I keep on seeing you all the time ? p. 107 OSCAR  --  Oh , no . The answer 's much simpler . You 're a woman . I 'm a man . MRS . PRICE  --  There are lots of men . . . . I 've never . . . OSCAR  --  I know . This is your first flirtation . But it wo n't be your last . MRS . PRICE  --  It 's not a flirtation . You 're married . And so am I. OSCAR  --  Good God  --  you do n't think it 's an intellectual companionship  --  do you ? She does n't answer this , but changes the subject coolly . MRS . PRICE  --  How long has it been since you 've seen Julien Fields ? OSCAR  --  I do n't know . . . months . . . years . MRS . PRICE  --  Olga told me that he was one of the ones she made you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd always been a sort of hanger-on . OSCAR Apropos of nothing . Poor old Julien ! The mills of the high gods do grind exceedingly small , at times . I wonder that they bother . MRS . PRICE  --  Poor Julien  --  nothing ! Poor Edith , I say ! . . . And Mr. Greenough might have married her once . Now it 's too late . Everybody knows he 's kept her . Earle says he started out by trying to protect her  --  and he still pretends to live at a club in town . But they went to Europe together  --  first ; then they took to living together openly in the country ; and now  --  She shrugs . He 's here all the time . . . and everybody knows  --  and even marriage could n't make things really all right for her . Poor Edith  --  she was born soft . But as for her husband  --  he 's only himself to blame . p. 108 OSCAR  --  Of course . Himself  --  and the mischief-making high gods that beckoned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How smug and comfortable we get in this world when the dice fall right for us . You and I are very , very superior human beings , my child . Your husband had a talent for tinkering with engines ; and my wife  --  once she was my wife  --  set her heart on a grey squirrel coat . So we are successes . Let us salute ourselves . He lifts her face between his hands and is about to kiss it . MRS . PRICE Warningly and angrily . Do n't do that ! I do n't like it ! OSCAR laughs and moves away . MRS . PRICE goes and stares out of the window . LAURA enters . LAURA Mrs. Fields thanks you very much for the flowers and for asking about Miss Janet , and she says she 's sorry not to see you  --  but she hopes you 'll find it convenient to come another time  --  any time at all , but you can make sure of finding her if you 'll telephone . OSCAR  --  We will . Tomorrow perhaps , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone . To MRS . PRICE . Ready ? MRS . PRICE  --  Yes . To LAURA , who is leading the way out . Do tell Mrs. Fields how glad we are about her little girl . . . . They go , their voices dying away down the hall . GREENOUGH enters presently and sits down , his face between his hands  --  a sullen , unhappy look on his face . After a few moments EDITH follows  --  coming and kneeling beside him , her arm about his neck , her attitude full of tenderness and compassion. p. 109 EDITH Very gently , as if continuing an argument . Oh  --  but we must n't quarrel ! GREENOUGH does not answer at once . EDITH is radiant from a long sleep , although her eyes are , for the instant , troubled . She has wrapped herself in a tea-gown  --  delicate and arial in the effect of its pale colours and falls of lace . About her neck is a long string of pearls . Her hair is freshly massed upon her head , and she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman of three years before  --  but is exquisite and gracious with something rare and wonderful about her . She repeats her appeal . We wo n't quarrel  --  will we ? GREENOUGH rises suddenly and closes the door to the hall . EDITH rises and goes to the fireplace . He returns to his chair . She resumes . You 've been so wonderful , Walter  --  through it all . . . . But you 're making me feel very  --  very awkward . . . . Of course I did n't want to see him . . . . I think you know that after that night when you came up to me and put your hand on my shoulder  --  and said  --  " Stop . . . stop  --  where do you think you 're going  --  running like this  --  " She stops and does not for an instant go on . Then she speaks again with great sweetness . Thank God you 'd walked away from our house that night  --  just ahead of me ! I think you know that  --  that  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . . . . He does n't answer She continues . I do n't say that from that moment the new life was a happy life . One gets used to great changes slowly . But I have been happy , Walter . And I 've the very deepest respect for you . . . and a gratitude that 's like nothing else  --  exactly  --  in the world . Again silence falls between them . And then again she goes over to him and is kneeling beside him . You made life all over for me . You 've been so generous . . . . Please be generous now . p. 110 GREENOUGH Kiss me . For an instant his lips are on hers . Then he speaks roughly . Have it your way . Have him here when you want him here  --  after she comes  --  as long as she 's not able to go to the country . I do n't suppose that even you will think I ought to ask him to visit us there . His tone is bitter . EDITH is silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm going to the camp . I 'll stay until you 're settled in the country . EDITH No  --  do n't leave me ! I do n't want you to be driven away like that ! GREENOUGH Why not ? EDITH Because . . . She rises and her mind takes a new direction . You 're right , I suppose . It 's too awkward for him to be coming here . We 'll keep her in the hospital where he can see her  --  GREENOUGH Nonsense . She 'll be better off here . You want her here . She 'll come home . That 's settled . But I 'll get out . . . . I need a change anyway . Only  --  He rises and takes her by the shoulders . Once you said something  --  about the terrible clairvoyance of love . You were talking about yourself  --  and him . Well , I 've got that  --  that clairvoyance . I 'll know if anything happens to change you . p. 111 EDITH Nothing can happen . Everything happened that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  this  --  this sort of thing never happened before . . . . EDITH Do n't you realize , Walter , that there 's only a stone-cold feeling in my heart for Julien Fields ? I 've seen him there  --  sitting by Janet 's bed  --  drawing pictures for her  --  holding her hand , trying , even , to pray to something that he did n't believe in  --  and I felt nothing  --  nothing for him , at all  --  except  --  GREENOUGH Except what ? EDITH Except how terribly sad it was that I felt nothing . GREENOUGH I 'm afraid . There 's a certain door that you wo n't shut  --  EDITH Walter  --  I 'm very sensible ! You 're much more sentimental about this than I am . Please believe me . GREENOUGH There 's one thing I 'd believe against all the evidence in the world  --  and that 's your word . . . . I 'm going away . I ca n't say to you " feel this and that "  --  or " do n't feel this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to feel . But I can say to you , " Give me your word that you 'll never go back to him . " Will you do that ? p. 112 EDITH Go back to him ! But  --  Her amazement is almost touched with humour as she promises ironically . I give you my word , my dear . I 'll never go back to him . . . . Now ? For answer he holds her in his arms an instant , and kisses her , speaking with sudden gentleness , close to tears . GREENOUGH I 'm so sorry  --  dearest  --  about all this . . . . We 'd better arrange it so we can be married . . . . It will be better for Janet , you know  --  she 's growing up . It will be better in every way , for us both . Do n't you think so , too ? She nods " yes . " He goes on , suddenly , almost buoyantly . That 's sensible  --  at any rate . No more of this apologetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those that like it can come and see how happy we are . . . and those that do n't can go to the devil with our compliments . If we 're going to look round the place at Westbury before dark , we 'd better be starting pretty soon . I 've telephoned them to have some dinner for us . . . . I want to get back in time to catch my train . EDITH You 're really going to the camp ? GREENOUGH Yes  --  but I 'm going with a much happier mind than I thought possible half an hour ago . I 'll let you dress now  --  while I see if William has attended to everything . p. 113 EDITH Very well , I 'll  --  But as he starts to walk with her to the door she sees the window boxes and pauses , standing in the window . Oh ! So Knight came  --  and filled the window boxes ! GREENOUGH Come away from that open window . You 'll take cold in that thin thing . EDITH Nonsense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms up in the air . This is like June ! It 's not like April , at all . GREENOUGH Come on  --  come on . EDITH In a moment . I wo n't be an instant getting into my frock . GREENOUGH All right . But it 's nearly four  --  and it takes an hour and twenty minutes  --  the best we can do . EDITH I know . I 'll be down and in the car waiting for you ten minutes before you 're ready . . . . Janet 's a good little thing  --  is n't she ? Her voice breaks suddenly , as she adds . She looked too lovely today . . . . She 's going to be pretty , Walter . She comes away from the balcony reluctantly . GREENOUGH She 's damned plucky . I 'll say that . EDITH goes to a desk . GREENOUGH pauses at the door to look back inquiringly. p. 114 EDITH Do n't wait , dear . I 'm only looking for a list I made out  --  things I want the housekeeper to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He goes . EDITH looks about , searching for her list . The door opens and STEWART enters . STEWART Oh  --  pardon me . . . . I left Walter here a moment ago . Am I intruding ? EDITH Come in . . . . No  --  I 'm just going , too . Walter is packing , I believe . STEWART Is he going somewhere ? EDITH To the Adirondacks for a few weeks . STEWART Good . . . . She looks a little surprised . He hurries on . Edith  --  EDITH Yes ? STEWART There 's someone here I think you ought to see  --  for a moment . EDITH Who ? STEWART Julien . EDITH Julien ! STEWART Yes . EDITH But why  --  ? p. 115 STEWART Let him tell you . GREENOUGH enters , and stands near the doorway , listening . EDITH It is n't necessary . STEWART He 's going away . He wo n't come here again . He had something that he meant to say to Walter ,  --  but Walter wo n't see him . GREENOUGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in  --  if he 's still here . We 'll both see him  --  and that will end it . STEWART I 'll bring him . He goes quickly . GREENOUGH To himself more than to EDITH . That 's best , I think . EDITH says nothing . GREENOUGH walks half-angrily , half-nervously about the room . EDITH goes and sits down on the far side of the room . GREENOUGH glances at her sharply . LAURA enters . LAURA To GREENOUGH . Pardon me , sir , but  --  She includes EDITH in her look . There have n't been any orders given about dinner yet . GREENOUGH No one will be here . p. 116 LAURA That 's all the cook wanted to know . We were n't sure . She starts to go . GREENOUGH Bring Mrs. Fields something to put around her , first . LAURA Yes , sir . She turns about and goes out by a different door . EDITH Absently , pulling her pearls out from her throat . But I 'm not cold . . . . He does not answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur , and goes to EDITH . LAURA Shall I put this around you , Madame ? EDITH Thanks , Laura . And have everything ready for me to dress to go to the country . LAURA Yes , Madame . Everything 's laid out . And I 'm going to put your heavy wraps in the car , now . She goes out again through the door into EDITH 's room . Almost at the same moment STEWART enters from the hall , with JULIEN following . There is silence as they come into the room and as GREENOUGH and JULIEN nod to each other  --  and then JULIEN and EDITH . JULIEN has the unhappy , shabby look of one of the millions of men whom life has cowed . But there is still in him something of courage for the great quest  --  and something of his old indifference to fortune , happiness and the peace of others. p. 117 JULIEN To GREENOUGH , impatiently , out of the pause . Naturally I did n't know when I came here that you were going to regard a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pas . I suppose , however , an apology is in order for this intrusion . . . . I apologise . LAURA enters , closing the door a bit noisily behind her , carrying a fur coat and a tissue-wrapped package . EDITH Quickly , from her place on the other side of the room , lifting her hand to hurry LAURA out . Put those things there  --  on a chair . LAURA puts them down quickly , and instead of passing through the room retreats quickly  --  closing the door behind her . EDITH Sit down , Ned . . . . You might sit down , Julien . . . Walter . . . . She glances at a chair . The three men sit . EDITH turns to JULIEN expectantly . Now . . . ? JULIEN It 's not so easy to talk now . Everything 's got too difficult , somehow . What I came for  --  he speaks to GREENOUGH with sudden energy was to thank you , first , for all that your money has done for my daughter . p. 118 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's had the best  --  when she needed it worst . I realise that . You  --  you were able to buy Death off . Money 's a fine thing to have at a time like that . . . . I 'm sorry my own pockets were empty  --  as usual . EDITH 's eyes are suddenly turned miserably away from JULIEN . GREENOUGH , too , looks away . STEWART After a pause . By the way  --  perhaps this is n't exactly the time to mention it  --  but if you want some work to do  --  JULIEN With a quick gesture , stopping him . I ca n't settle to anything . . . . It 's no use , thank you . EDITH Almost crying out . But , Julien  --  how do you get along ? You must  --  JULIEN Do n't worry . One odd job keeps me going to another . Besides , my old firm  --  they still remember that I sat at a desk there in a very regular fashion for ten years  --  that was your doing , Edith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the work I 'm willing to undertake . He laughs . They even offered to take me back the other day , again , and start me in where I left off five years ago . That 's fine progress , is n't it ? p. 119 EDITH Quietly . You ought to go . JULIEN Why ? EDITH It may not be anything  --  very  --  very brilliant , just now  --  but it would be better than just drifting  --  aimlessly  --  doing nothing at all . JULIEN I 'm not so sure . You 'd think that , of course . He smiles . But there are worse things than being free  --  to drift . You never know what 's just round the corner . Probably it 's somebody you owe money to  --  but it might be a bird of paradise flashing like a rainbow through an alley . EDITH So you 're still hunting  --  ? JULIEN Interrupting . For birds of paradise ? You might put it that way . . . . No , there 's a chance of finding that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself free to do his best . But to tie myself up to a desk , now , would be the end of everything  --  for me . STEWART I think you 're wrong , Fields . GREENOUGH Impatiently . You ca n't expect me to take a very sympathetic point of view  --  and I hope you 'll pardon me for saying it , but , as far as I can make out , you 're trying to explain to yourself , and to us , an inactivity that may be  --  Are you sure you 're not  --  just lazy ? p. 120 JULIEN I am lazy  --  but that  --  that 's not the main difficulty . With sudden scorn . You would n't call a man standing still in a fog lazy  --  would you ? However  --  there 's no use of your bothering about me . I 'm going away so I wo n't have to put any unnecessary strain on your hospitality  --  and Janet might not understand why I do n't come round unless she knows I 'm not in town . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's one thing more . The sort of life that Edith and I have been living is n't exactly to our taste . She would n't bother about a divorce in the beginning  --  JULIEN And you 'd like one now , so you can be married ? I see . That ought to be easily arranged . I 'll do anything that you suggest  --  GREENOUGH Then before you go  --  since you 're leaving town  --  suppose you talk over the details with my cousin ? He indicates STEWART . JULIEN Certainly . . . . I suppose there are facts you ought to get . . . . A pause falls . JULIEN turns to STEWART . You and I might go back to that room with the Romney over the mantelpiece . He turns to GREENOUGH . Then I 'll be on my way . . . . That 's a fine Romney . Next to having money for the doctors and the nurses when there 's a child ill , I 'd like it to spend for things like that . p. 121 GREENOUGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . JULIEN To EDITH , who rises . This is good-bye , Edith . She holds out her hand . He takes it , speaking with sudden simplicity . There 's no use getting sentimental , but you know that if you and Janet needed me now I 'd be willing to be a galley-slave at that desk I hate so much  --  the rest of my life . It was good of you to send for me  --  and let me see her  --  so often . But I know you 're both better off than you ever were with me . EDITH Good-bye , Julien . I want you and Janet to go on being the best of friends , always . JULIEN Thanks . You 're very generous . He drops her hand and turns quickly to STEWART . Shall we go ? STEWART Yes . To GREENOUGH . I 'll see you later , Walter . JULIEN and GREENOUGH nod to each other , and then JULIEN follows STEWART from the room . EDITH comes over and stands by the mantelpiece . GREENOUGH waits for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice touched with compassion and tenderness. p. 122 EDITH Julien 's a child , really . . . . GREENOUGH Well , that 's done . EDITH Yes . That 's done . You understand , do n't you , how impossible it is to keep from feeling sorry for Julien ? And to keep from worrying a little about him . He 's so wrong-headed . . . . He 's very charming with Janet . Yesterday they were playing that she was his mother  --  LAURA enters , her face averted . She stops , as if she had something to say , and then starts to hurry out . Laura  --  LAURA stops , her face still averted , her eyes lowered . EDITH continues . You may take my cloak now  --  but after this please go through the other door to my room . It 's awkward when there are people here to have someone passing through . LAURA does not answer . EDITH lifts her voice . Do you understand , Laura ? LAURA nods " yes . " EDITH is a little annoyed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  when I speak to you  --  and answer me  --  The maid lifts her face  --  convulsed with weeping . Gently . Oh ! I 'm sorry . . . . You may go . There is a bare pause ; the maid does not go . EDITH continues . Or is there something that you want to tell me ? Perhaps I can help  --  p. 123 LAURA No  --  it 's  --  Someone telephoned  --  A sob checks her . Suddenly EDITH is at the maid 's side , her hands gripping both LAURA 's . EDITH It 's  --  not  --  Janet ! There is no answer . Something falls from GREENOUGH 's hand to the floor . EDITH is frantically shaking LAURA by the shoulders . Tell me  --  tell me  --  tell me  --  LAURA Convulsively . She 's dead  --  the poor lamb  --  EDITH slowly releases her and stares at nothing . LAURA weeps . GREENOUGH When  --  did you  --  hear this ? You 're sure  --  ? LAURA They 're on the telephone now  --  the hospital  --  I meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her  --  EDITH Still staring at nothing and shivering slightly . Where 's that scarf you brought a minute ago  --  Laura ? GREENOUGH Put it around her  --  He touches EDITH on the shoulder as LAURA looks for the scarf . Edith  --  darling  --  p. 124 EDITH With a long sigh . It must have happened very suddenly . . . . Or do you believe it , Walter ? I ca n't get it through my head  --  that  --  it 's so . I must go to her  --  I must go at once ! LAURA hands GREENOUGH the scarf . He puts it about EDITH who shivers into it . GREENOUGH No , no ; stay here . . . . Keep a good grip on yourself , darling . EDITH Suddenly . Someone must tell Julien ! He 's here , is n't he ? Oh , poor Julien ! GREENOUGH I 'll see that he 's told . He turns to LAURA . Stay here with her . . . . I 'll go to the telephone , and then come back . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear  --  EDITH sits down . EDITH Presently . You may go , Laura . But LAURA does not go . EDITH raises her voice . You may go . . . . I 'd rather be alone . You might light the fire first . It 's turning cold . LAURA looks in surprise at the brilliant sunlight pouring into the room . Then she kneels and lights the fire on the hearth. p. 125 LAURA Pityingly as she goes . I do n't like to leave you  --  but  --  She does not finish . Something stern in EDITH 's attitude orders her away . Left alone , EDITH moves toward the fire , shivering and warming her hands . Then , her eyes bright with pain , she lifts her head , whispering . EDITH To herself , brokenly . Mother 's blessed comfort  --  Janet . . . darling  --  GREENOUGH returns and comes and stands near her , looking down into the fire . EDITH Poor Julien ! . . . There is a pause . Then she speaks suddenly . Walter  --  I gave you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go back to him . . . . I know . EDITH I ca n't promise that , now ; you must give me my word back . He may need me . GREENOUGH does not answer . EDITH continues after a moment . Yes  --  I must be free to do as I think best , now . GREENOUGH Steadily . There 's nothing I can say , of course  --  This is n't the time to say anything  --  about one 's self . . . . It 's the other man you want with you now . So  --  I give you your word back , Edith . And I  --  I 'll get out . I 'll send him to you now . He goes . EDITH waits . JULIEN enters . His face is wet with tears . He goes toward her and she comes toward him . For an instant neither speaks p. 126 JULIEN Oh , Edith ! He sobs on her shoulder . EDITH Poor , poor Julien ! Her arms are about him . JULIEN What are we going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gone . . . . And I ca n't bear it ! EDITH I knew you 'd feel like that . But you must bear it , Julien . . . . We 'll have to bear it together . . . . Come here . . . . She makes him sit beside her . He huddles into her embrace . JULIEN I used to be so frightened  --  in the hospital . I kept thinking of Death  --  as a kidnapper . I used to hold on to her hand to make sure she was still there ! EDITH I know . Put your head on my shoulder . You 're my little boy again . And you need me again . And we have each other  --  just as we used to . . . . JULIEN Lifting his head . No , no . . . . That 's not true . We have n't each other . The past is all gone  --  blown away like leaves in the wind . We ca n't ever get it back . And Janet is a leaf in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks about restlessly . She rises and stands near the fire , shivering again. p. 127 EDITH But  --  you and I are still here , Julien . And everything 's forgiven between us and set straight  --  because we need each other again , at least . JULIEN is silent for a moment  --  then he comes and puts his arm about her as he realizes her meaning . JULIEN You 're being very wonderful . You 're all broken up now  --  and so am I. . . . But , Edith dear , I do n't want you to think of doing  --  what you 're thinking of doing . . . . Things are better  --  the way they are . Heaven knows I 'll think of you and Janet day after day  --  and night after night  --  but we ca n't bring back the other days . We 'll bury them in the little grave they 're making for her . EDITH moves away  --  groping for something . She finds her long fur coat and puts it on . Then she sits down  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's turning very cold . . . . JULIEN Gently , but absorbed with his own thoughts Give him his chance . He 'll make you a good husband . I never did . . . . There is a pause . Then he continues . To be honest , Edith , we 'd find it impossible  --  without Janet . . . . You 're used to luxury now . . . and it suits me to be alone . You must n't think of it . He leans his head on his hands , wearily . EDITH stares at him , as if trying to understand something . He speaks again , rousing himself , presently . Well  --  I 'll go  --  I 'm all in . . . and I 've got to be alone . Do people ever say good-bye ? Does anything ever really end , I wonder ? p. 128 EDITH Significantly . Sometimes , I think  --  things end . JULIEN I suppose so . . . . I 've got to get out and walk and fight this thing off  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lays his hand for a moment on her shoulder . Poor Edith  --  try not to let it get you . He goes . She laughs a little , and gets up and wanders again to the fire . The maid enters , and busies herself about the room , eager to be of some comfort or use , but EDITH does not notice her . STEWART enters . Her back is to him , and she does not notice him . He comes and stands beside her , in front of the fire . STEWART Edith . . . . But he has to speak a second time before she hears . Edith . EDITH There is a quality of great patience in her voice . Yes , Ned ? STEWART I 'm sorry ; you know that . We all loved Janet . EDITH Simply . She was a good little thing ; and getting very pretty . STEWART Repeating . I 'm sorry . p. 129 EDITH Coldly , very quietly . Why ? But before he can speak , in his surprise , she continues in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . It 's all shifting sands , Ned . Shifting sands and changing winds . It 's just as well that Janet wo n't have to grow up . No . . . . I 'm not sorry that the Kidnapper came and took her . STEWART But , Edith  --  this is a strange way to talk . EDITH Looking at him piercingly . You think so ? STEWART Uncomfortably . Julien did n't go  --  did he ? EDITH Yes . STEWART But Walter said  --  EDITH Walter was wrong . Julien did n't want me . STEWART But I thought . . . Walter thought . . . He hesitates ; then he can not refrain from asking , in great surprise and curiosity . What are you going to do now ? EDITH Again she smiles . God knows . THE CURTAIN FALLS                                            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
