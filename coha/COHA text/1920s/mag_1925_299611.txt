Passengers in the side concourse of the Pennsylvania Station , Manhattan , noticed , last Saturday afternoon , a great limousine drawn up not far from a taxicab stand . It was a car hardly designed to lounge unnoticed through the streets of the metropolis , for one side of the shining tonneau was tastefully draped in ar large British Union Jack , the other in a large U. S. flag . In it sat three high hats-Sir Harry Gloster Armstrong , British Consul ; Walter L. Clark , President of the Grand Central Art Galleries ; Irving T. Bush , Art patron . They were waiting for Sir Esm Howard , British Ambassador to the U. S. , to arrive from Washington . On the other side of Manhattan Island , 4,000 people-said to be the largest assemblage ever to attend a New York exhibition-waited for him also .
