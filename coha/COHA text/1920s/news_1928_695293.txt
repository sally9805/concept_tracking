txt Pierre S. du Pont was granted a leave of absence from his position as chairman of the board of General Motors Corp . at the meeting of directors nt which he presented his resignation Thursday . His resignation was not accepted . Alfred P. Sloan . Jr .. president . said : " Pierre S. du Pont submitted his resignation as char1man because he felt his nctivities with the Association Against the Prohibition Arnendement might cause , confusion in the public mind and give the impression that General Motors was involved in that movement . The board felt that the position of the corporation having been stated was understood and that all should appreciate that Mr. du Pont 's activities in connection with that association 's work are entli ? ly those of an individual and did not concern the corporation . Tro. resignation was therefore not accepted and Mr. du Pont was accorded a leave of absence Instead . " Cash Position Strong Mr. Sloan also stated that the corporation 's cash position continues strong . cuireiat cash and maiketable securities aggregating 5235.000.000 approximately .

The meeting at which Mr. du Pont 's resignation was considered lasted for over an hour . John J. Raskob , who recently resigned as chairman of the finance committee but retains his position as a director and vice president . was not present at the meeting . It is inconceivable that Mr. du Pont will take as prominent a part in the political field as that taken by John J. Raskob , who recently resigned from active duties with General Motors to devote his entire time to the position of Democratic National chairman As a matter of fact , it is believed Mr. du Pont 's political activities will be concerned almost entirely with his duties as chairman of the executive committee of the Association Against the Eighteenth Amendment wiiicn l ( imam he has held for many months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ du Pont 's interests and responsibilities cover a wide variety of subjects and anything he might do on any public question would be regarded as a personal activity rather than one involving either General Motors or the du Pont company . Reports that there has been internal friction General Motors are entirely unfounded . In the interest of good business it is obvious the corporate interest should not be sacrificed to the political interest of any party , candidate or legal enactment which has no possible bearing on the business of the corporation . It should be remembered that the du Pont interests . through their personal ownership of stock and throue-la the du Pont company holdings of General Motors . are practically in control of the corporation The du Pont company holds 23 , , or over 4.000.000 shares , of the 17,400.000 shares of General Motors Corp .
