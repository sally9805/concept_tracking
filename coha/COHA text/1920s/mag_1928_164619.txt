Buyers and borrowers of best sellers were mightily of a twitter , last week , at news of new exploits by the author of Revolt in the Desert , famed Colonel Thomas Edward Lawrence . He , with a modesty not inferior to Lindbergh 's , has rejected all the honors and decorations which Britons sought to heap upon him in reward for his success in fomenting an Arabian revolt against Turkey during the War . Last week , after eight years of self-imposed nonentity as a British private , T. E. Lawrence returned to Arabia as a British plenipotentiary and arrived at San'a , the Capital of the Imamate of Yemen . <P> Mightily of a twitter were the twelve warlike princes of Yemen and their potent father , the Imam Yahya ben Muhammad ben Hamid al Din . Over coffee brewed from the peerless beans of Menakha , and with the eight gates of the Imam 's capital barred for the night , a conference took place in deadly secrecy between Plenipotentiary and Potentate . <P> Officials close to the Secretary of State for India said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Lawrence began last April . They recalled that Amir Amanullah , Khan of Afghanistan , has invited to a Pan-Asiatic Parley at Kabul , Afghanistan , next November , delegates from the nationalist parties of India and Egypt , and representatives of the nationalist governments of Persia and Turkey , together with emissaries from all the Sultans , Imams and potent Sheiks* of Arabia . <P> The intimation was allowed to escape with contented British smugness that Colonel Lawrence , whose Arab friends have created him a Prince of Mecca , is now using his unique influence to combat the Pan-Asiatic schemes of the Amir of Afghanistan-who recently toured Europe , was the guest of George V ( TIME , March 26 , April 2 ) . <P> <P> *Such as Sheik Ahmed ibn Jabir al Subah , ruler of Kuwait .
