THE INTIMATE PAPERS OF COLONEL HOUSE-Arranged as a Narrative by Charles Seymour ( Vol . Ill-Into the World War ; Vol . IV-The Ending of the War ) - Houghton Mifflin ( $10 ) . <P> The Inside Story . " There will be no war , " said Wilson to House in January , 1917 . Three months later , the same resolute energy he had expended on maintaining the peace , was doggedly diverted to the pursuit of war . The die cast , Wilson was out to win , and not so much a military victory as a moral conquest of internationalism over autocratic nationalism . But the tangible military victory being prerequisite to the moral conquest , Wilson passionately concerned himself with such tangibles as gold , food , fighting men . And lest he or his people flag , Balfour was sent over , a French mission was sent over , to emphasize the terrific need , to encourage , goad , inspire . <P> But the great historic significance of Balfour 's visit was the fact-now first indisputably established by the evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret treaties upon which , rather than upon Wilson 's ideal , the ultimate Peace Treaty was virtually based . Wilson 's 1917 decision , fortified if not formulated by Colonel House , was that any discussion of the treaties would lead to a disagreement among the allies , and hence play into the hand of the enemy . Anyway , Wilson was sure that U. S. economic power was such that " when the war is over we can force them to our way of thinking . " At such navet , or was it conceit ? , how Balfour must have laughed up his trim cuff , Clemenceau up his wrinkled sleeve . <P> Finally came the grand , the fascinating , fiasco of Versailles , brilliant as so often before with the greatest figures of the day . Most brilliant was Wilson , the man of vision ; House his man of execution-for in most things the two worked as one , supplementing each other . True , House did not agree in several vital points : he advised against Wilson 's attending the Conference ( lest he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political wisdom of including Republican Root and Taft in the mission ; he favored more compromise with Clemenceau , and later the acceptance of the Lodge reservations . But he bowed to the greater man 's adamantine will , contented himself with the frequent occasions when his advice was accepted ; devoted his energies to the colossal double-headed chimera of a Peace in and by and through a League of Nations . <P> Not the least of his considerable share of the labors was to foster his cordial relations with European and Asiatic diplomats , all of whom held him in high esteem and gladly gave him their confidence when they feared his austerer chief . " All roads lead ultimately to Magnolia " ( House 's summer place ) , said Northcliffe . <P> House comments upon various men : <P> Wilson- " intellectually entirely democratic . . . unfortunate , for the reason that his mind led him where his taste rebelled . " <P> Hoover- " the kind of man that has to have complete control in order to do the thing well . " <P> Clemenceau- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all afternoon . I asked him how they had gotten on ... ' Splendidly , we disagreed about everything . ' "
