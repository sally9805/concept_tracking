The following books , economically , politically , historically , or biographically related to Foreign News , have recently been published in the U. S. : <P> <P> TWELVE YEARS AT THE IMPERIAL GERMAN COURT-Count Robert Zedlitz-Trtzschler-Doran ( $5.00 ) . For seven years , Count Zedlitz-Trtzschler was Controller of the Imperial Household of Kaiser Wilhelm II , now Kaiser of a small estate at Doom , Holland . For seven years , he lived almost cheek by jowl with his Imperial master ; he knew him as few men did ; he left him in 1910 , thoroughly disgusted and , as Bismarck did 20 years earlier , with a profound sense that the Kaiser 's absolutism would lead Germany to catastrophe . His view of the Kaiser , prejudices duly discounted , is favorable rather than otherwise ; certainly more flattering than the author intends or the Kaiser deserves . <P> <P> THE FARINGTON DIARY , VOL . III*-Joseph Farington . Edited by James Greig - Doran ( $7.50 ) . If Joseph Farington was a mediocre artist , he at least excelled as a diarist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his books teem with piquant anecdotes about Nelson , George III and IV , Pitt , Napoleon , Fox , Dr. <P> <P> Johnson , Sir Joshua Reynolds and a hundred others whose names have made history . Students of history will find the Diary a mine of information ; the ordinary reader can not fail to be engrossed by the absorbing account of life as it was during the late Georgian period . <P> <P> LADY SUFFOLK AND HER CIRCLE-Lewis Melville - Houghton Mifflin ' ( $5.00 ) . The light which this book diffuses on the dark ages of the early Georges shines like a beacon upon a dismal barren island . Lady Suffolk , Mistress of George II , is the lady of the lamp . In 40 letters upon which the author has based his work , she gives some choice sidelights on the social life of the time ; and the author in his turn has been able to embellish them with many an observation drawn from his immense knowledge of the period . The reader learns that George I was depressed at becoming King of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect , that life with the German Georges was not quite as dull from the inside as it appears from the outside . <P> <P> THE FRENCH REVOLUTION IN ENGLISH HISTORY-Philip Anthony Brown - Button ( $3.00 ) . Philip Brown was a young Oxford graduate who died a soldier 's death on the fields of Flanders in 1915 in his 30th year . Prof. Gilbert Murray , famed Greek scholar , pays ample tribute to his great intellectual gifts in a short introduction . <P> The book deals with the influence of the French Revolution on British society-using that word in its broad sense-and parallels to some extent the present day influence of the Bolsheviki on nations outside of Russia . Readers of Carlyle , of Burke , of biographers such as John Morley , of other historians , will have a clear idea of the magnitude of the diversified reactions which the bloody fall of the French monarchy had in England . But in this book these influences are specifically set forth in relation to the then radicals and with an intensely penetrating analysis of an aspect of the Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
