Twenty-five years ago-on July 19 , 1902 , to be exact-nine men representing New York City and being called the " Giants " were playing baseball against Philadelphia . Most of them had sonorous Irish names-Brodie , Bresnahan , McGinnity , McGann , McGraw . They lost the game , 5 to 3 . But the crowd of some 10,000 was not entirely displeased . The new manager and shortstop* of the Giants , John Joseph McGraw , seemed to be a fighter and a leader who knew the difference between first base and home plate . New Yorkers predicted that he would get the Giants out of the " cellar " ( last place ) of the National League . He failed to do so in 1902 ; but he put the Giants in second place in 1903 and made them pennant winners in 1904 . Everyone knows the subsequent history of the Giants- nine more National League pennants and three world 's championships . Manager McGraw could develop comparatively green players into luminaries-the late Christopher Mathewson , + Lawrence Doyle , Ross Young , George Kelley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend fortunes to buy other teams ' luminaries . He began his high-priced acquisitions in 1908 by paying $11,000 for Richard Marquard . In later years the price went up-$50,000 for " Irish " Meusel , $100,000 apiece for Hugh McQuillan , David Bancroft , Henry Groh . Said Manager McGraw : " You ca n't bring the money into the box office without spending some of it first . " Last week , approaching the celebration of his Silver Anniversary as Manager of the Giants , Mr. McGraw was having troubles . His team , even though it is captained by that mighty slugger , Rogers Hornsby , was in fourth place , losing games with exasperating regularity . After suffering four straight defeats at the hands of the Chicago Cubs , the Giants lost two out of four games to the St. Louis Cardinals . Meanwhile , a newspaper despatch quoted Mr. McGraw as saying : " I am getting tired of traveling and I expect to step out as manager . Hornsby is the man to carry on . The members of the club all swear by Hornsby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said : " They always start that report when the team is losing . " However , McGraw had praised Hornsby highly on Hornsby Day in St. Louis and he had hinted at retirement " some day . " McGraw is 54 . It would not be surprising to see him give up baseball when his contract as Manager of the Giants expires in 1929 . On that " some day " Coogan 's Bluff will lose its nabob , President Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia University ( see p. 16 ) will lose an old neighbor and Manhattan will lose one of its most significant Irishmen . <P> *McGraw later played third base . +His son , Christopher Jr. , was graduated from Bucknell University this month .
