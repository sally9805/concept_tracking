It is 26 miles , 385 yards from the doorstep of the New York Athletic Club , Manhattan , to the City Hall in Long Beach , Long Island . The road lies through the city and over a bridge and through a suburban district crowded with automobiles , trucks , delivery wagons , boys on bicycles , people walking , busses , trolley-cars , and traffic cops . Last week 30 marathoners ran a race along this road and Joie Ray won it . His time was within two minutes of the Olympic record for 26 miles made on a course that had no traffic on it at all . <P> The main facts about Joie Ray are well known . He has blond hair and has spent most of his life driving a taxicab in Chicago . His nickname is Chesty because he usually announces that he is going to win and tells what his time will be . He is the best prophet among runners . He is the only American who has run the mile in competition under 4:20 more than six times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record . Last month when he finished third in the Boston marathon ( TIME , April 30 ) his first long distance race , his shoes had to be cut away from his swollen and bleeding feet . Clarence DeMar won at Boston . Ray finished with glazed eyes , a haggard face . At Long Beach , DeMar finishing seventh , was haggard , Ray happy . He kissed his hand to the Mayor as he crossed the finish line . " See those feet " he said in the locker room , crinkling his toes , " no blisters on them , eh boy ? No sir . I feel as smooth as silk . Now that I have earned a place on the Olympic team I will win the Olympic Marathon for the U. S. A. "
