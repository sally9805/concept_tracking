Which of the many books are going into the public edition 1 can not say . 1 doubt if we find the real Lawrence in it , as we have pieced him together from inferences and confidences in the quarto . He is a quietist , a visionary , a scholar with a passion for the classics , it poet himself ill his own medium , but ridden by a demon of self-crit icism and self-distrust : and his ci.clt Pillars al Wisdom falls short of his standard . Ile hates noise , and does not care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long its they leave him alone . One of the many legends about the liberator of the Hejaz I can vouch for as true - that for greater privacy and detachment he quitted his fellowship at All Souls to become a private in the Air Force under an assumed name . Lawrence 's flight from the limelight , his refusal of decorations and rewards , his general self-effacement , have been attributed , by people who do not understand his shyness , to vanity ? a subtle sort of self-advertisement . I maw him de. ; , . ribed the other day by the editor of a reputable London journal as a very vain boy who loved to dress up in Arab clothes . The article speciously discounted his Arabian achievement . Lawrence has been so obstinate in not coming out to receive his ovation ? and worse , in locking up his book ? that he has made a number of people impatient . There is also a class of soldier ? not Allenby and his Staff ? that has misunderstood him . As an amateur and an irregular he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In appearance he is academic and aloof , not a comfortable or clubbable person . I confess to certain misgivings on my own part when I first saw him among soldiers in his stainless khaki Staff uniform in Mesopotamia . He had come over from Egypt on some chimerical political errand ? which , incidentally , he detested . This was before his Hejaz campaign , and it never occurred to me that he could fight . And I doubt if it had occurred to him . He was not born a man of action , but had to cast himself in this clay . That he was able to put himself into the Arab mould seemed , to all who were merely acquainted with him , a miracle . Physically he had been condemned as unfit for active service , but his body was driven by his spirit , and lie became as efficient and enduring in the desert as his Bedouin companions . His habits of the recluse helped him here . He had always made it a rule to avoid rules in food and drink and sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bells . ' Thus he was able to go dry between wells . But this haphazard , unsociable hermit 's existence does not qualify one for command . Lawrence shrank from responsibility and action . Men were not his medium ; he hated soldiering , and felt himself unfitted for it . True , he had dabbled in theory . As an undergraduate of catholic interests he had read the usual books ? Clausewitz and Jomini , Mahan and Foch ; he had played with Napoleon 's campaigns , worked at Hannibal 's tactics , and followed the wars of Belisarius , ' like other Oxford men , ' but without thinking himself into the mind of a commander . However , his studios in strategy and military history must have been more than an academic hobby . After he left Oxford , but before the war , he knew Syria exactly , and had the strategic geography of the Crusaders and the first Arab conquest in his head . Thus during a lull in the fighting , when he made a secret excursion in disguise behind the Turkish lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrain and its possibilities to the new factors in the game ? the railways in Syria and Murray 's army in Sinai . Lawrence probably knew as much about the technique of war as many professional soldiers . But he owed little to Foch or Clausewitz ; he was not a book theorist , and he distrusted axioms . One detects a thinly disguised contempt for the text-crammed Stall ' College officer , not in his own spherk , of shock tactics , but in his inability to understand Lawrence 's irregular guerrilla activities ? a form of warfare which he invented , suitable to his material , reducible to no rules , but informed with an uncanny insight into the Arab 's temper and psychology . An enthusiast was needed who was a specialist in Arabian affairs , and Lawrence alone had the sympathy , vision , imagination , the ' touch ' with the Bedou ; combined with , as it proved , an entirely unexpected genius for handling men , and , more unexpected still , a practical knack of making his dreams material . Thus he became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . II Lawrence enters the scene as a Staff captain in Sir Archibald Murray 's Intelligence section in Cairo . Here he prepared maps , reported on the distribution of the Turkish army , and edited the Arab Bulletin , the secret weekly record of Middle Eastern politics ? an occupation for which he was , no doubt , eminently fitted , but one which he was not likely to endure long . The Arab Revolt was at this early stage discredited . Few of the Headquarters Staff believed in our Shereefian allies ; and they had reason , for without Lawrence the Arabs would have continued an uneffectual mob . Lawrence , however , was regarded with equal suspicion . He was too much of a zealot in this Arab business , and marked as a dangerous man . A plot was hatched to get him out of the way , into some sphere other than Arabia , where he might rust harmlessly . But he met stratagem with stratagem . His stratagem in Cairo was to make himself intolerable to the members of 1 the Staff on the Canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the split infinitives in their reports , and pointed out their general incompetence for their job . ' In a few days they were bubbling over on my account , and at last determined at no price to endure Inc longer as a colleague . ' When he took this strategic opportunity to apply for ten days ' leave to go for a joy ride on the Red Sea it was granted him . Lawrence did not return from his joy ride . As soon as he had broken bonds he got himself transferred from the Foreign Office to the Arab Bureau , which was not directly under the Egypt command . His task now was to find a leader for the Arab Revolt . He visited the Shereef , Hussein , at Jiddah , and sounded him . He sounded Abdulla , Ali , Zeid , sons of the Shereef ? all of whom , for one reason or another , he found wanting . But in Feisal he discovered the inspired prophet he was looking for , ' the finest instrument which God ever made for the Orient ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved in our halting course . ' Lawrence was drawn to Feisal at first sight . There was a great deal in common in their rich personalities . They were both dreamers , obsessed with one idea ? Lawrence the driving power , Feisal the rallying-point . Lawrence was the stronger and more practical . He , now the man of action , seems to have established a complete ascendancy over Feisal , but he does not tell us this . He found himself in virtual control of the Shereefian army very soon after absconding from his Staff work in Cairo , but for some time his position was undefined ? a sort of liaison officer . Later he speaks of himself as Feisal 's chief-of-staff . When a British officer was put in command at Akaba , Lawrence served as his subordinate . At twenty-eight he was too young for command , though Akaba was really his private gift to Allenby . He was never nominally the leader of the Arab forces . On his return to Headquarters Lawrence was surprised to find himself popular . The Staff was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the idea of crippling the main offensive in Palestine for his crazy side-show . But to everyone 's relief he declared strongly against the dispatch of a British force to Rabegh . His policy from beginning to end was to make the Arab movement self-supporting as far as practicable , except in material . Incidentally he believed that it would not justify its creation if the enthusiasm it inspired did not carry the Arabs on their own impulse to Damascus . This was his inward faith ; but he had stronger reasons , of course , against landing Allied troops in Arabia . The Shereef could rally his tribesmen only in a national cause , and they would have melted away into the desert at sight of a khaki-clad British regiment . We had always to take into account the Arab 's natural suspicion of foreigners . Even Feisal had his uneasy moments . ' We should be more at ease , ' he once remarked to Lawrence , if they ( the English ) were not such a disproportionate ally . ' And again : Does the ore admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cripple 's temper till it has found its feet . ' Lawrence gave his orders to the Arab troops through their own chiefs . He won their confidence , hypnotized them , and played on them as on wind instruments . He was indistinguishable from an Arab in his Mecca clothes . Feisal asked him to wear them because khaki would be suspect . The only wearers of khaki the Bedouin knew had been Turkish officers from whom they shrank with instinctive distrust . Until Lawrence adopted Arab dress Feisal had to explain his presence to every stranger . So we have the legend of the very vain boy who loved to dress up in splendid robes and preen himself as a prince of Mecca . It is astonishing that any of the Staff should have seriously thought of landing British troops at Rabegh for the defense of Mecca ? a movement which must have meant the complete shipwreck of the Arabian adventure . Possibly they would have been glad to be quit of it , and , having no great faith in the Arabs , were content to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responsible part , into the plan . Or , more probably , they failed through ignorance to understand the Arab 's sensitiveness to the invasion of his sacred soil by the foreigners . The French , however , could not plead ignorance . It was their studied policy to discredit the Shereef by making him appear our puppet . They had no interest in the success of the Arab Revolt ? very much the reverse . Thus their advice was dictated by political , not military , motives , with a view to colonial expansion in Syria after the war . They wanted to confine the Arab movement to the Hejaz , and even there to make the Shereef dependent on foreign aid , so that when Turkey was defeated the Allies could confer Medina on Hussein as his reward , leaving Syria to be exploited by France . It did not in the least suit their book that the lIejaz should deliver Damascus . Naturally Colonel Bremond , the Chief of the French Military Mission , was loud in his insistence on landing an Allied- brigade at Rabegh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project was abandoned . This was the first of many intrigues against the Arab movement which Lawrence countered . He might have been of the prophet 's family , so single-minded was he in his determination that the move- ment should progress on its own feet , impelled by its own spirit ; and , above all , that its success should be cumbered by no mortgages . His whole pride is the campaign was embittered by the fear , amounting almost to a conviction , that we were going to break our faith with the Arabs . The tribesmen trusted him , and no doubt believed , if they thought about it at all , that the Government he served had the same standard of honor . Lawrence felt like a conspirator . One of the reasons why he consistently refused decorations was that he wrote his own dispatches , and so would be rewarded on his own evidence ; but the main reason was that he was obsessed with the idea that he was playing 0 fraudulent part , play-acting , exploiting the Arabs ' highest ideals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we won the war , would be so much waste paper . But why ? He was perfectly frank with Feisal . It touched his honor to disclose the conditions of the Sykes-Picot treaty , an agreement with France inconsistent with Sir Henry MMahon 's pledge of Arab freedom , and he persuaded him that it could be set aside only if the Arabs redoubled their efforts against the Turks . His hope , and Feisal 's , was to establish a fait accompli at Damascus , and thus he in a position to extract a fair settlement from the Powers in conference . Lawrence repeatedly urged Feisal to trust in his own performance and strength . The fact of holding would be the justification of his right to hold . Lawrence had this justifying vision before his eyes through the whole campaign , and in the end was able to secure from Allenby assurance that the Arabs should be the first to enter Damascus and should there set up their own civil government . Lawrence 's directness with Feisal and old Nuri Shaalan would have put any other man on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpolitical herd , he gave them their life 's desire , abundance of loot , and an opportunity of killing Turks of which they had never dreamed . Nor had they any spiritual cause against their leader . Lawrence himself admits : ' By our swindle they were made heroes . We paid , and they profited by the deepest feeling of their lives . ' Lawrence 's part in the ' swindle , ' if there ever was one , is not apparent . He kept faith with the Arabs and with his own country . Feisal accepted his advice , and . the uncertainty of the settlement , and our possible ? no doubt his mentor said ' probable ' ? ingratitude , with resignation . And Nuri Shaalan , advised always to accept the latest of our contradictory pledges , fought without illusions . Thus he and Feisal carried on the war in the Hejaz , and , later , on Allenby 's flank in Syria , to its honorable conclusion ? Feisal ' hidden in his tent , veiled to remain a prophet , to keep alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration . His part was synthetic . He ' combined all these loose sparks into a firm flame . ' Nevertheless the sense of fraud continued to rankle and poison the cup of victory . We had incited the Arabs to fight for us by definite promises of self-government , and they looked to Lawrence for his endorsement of the written promise . Lawrence , of course , could never be sure . Even now he seems to regard himself as a successful trickster because he did not advise them to go home and not risk their lives in such an uncertain cause . So tender was his conscience on this point that he not only refused titles , rank , and decorations , but would not even touch his pay for the period of his service on the Arab front , though , as the event has proved , the promises have been fulfilled in both letter and spirit . When Lawrence joined Feisal the Arabs had recaptured Mecca from the Turks and were looking toward Medina . But the Turks , re6nforced , were again threatening Mecca . Feisal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabegh , the bulwark of Mecca , where there had been a question of sending a brigade , but he was persuaded by Lawrence and the others to move two hundred miles up the coast to Wejh , ignoring the main body of the enemy , to cut in on their communications . It was a bold move , as it risked the loss of Rabegh and Yenbo , and they had to march as a self-contained force with no base behind them and enemy country in front . But the Turks were taken by 294 LAWRENCE OF THE HEJAZ surprise , and the diversion justified itself . The capture of Wejh by threatening the enemy communications with Syria by the Hejaz railway entirely altered the face of the Hejaz campaign . The Turks had to abandon their offensive against Mecca and fall back on an entrenched position covering Medina . There they remained , crippled for lack of transport , and with the one link which connected them with their base very much at the Arabs ' mercy , until the end of the war . The Headquarters Staff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hussein , and the whole Arab contingent , were for evicting the garrison straightway . Lawrence , after a little reflection , saw that it would serve our purpose better to keep it there . This was entirely contrary to the manual and did not commend itself to his chiefs . Still it was sound strategy , as events proved . It became Lawrence 's habit to return to Cairo with something big in his pocket , and he was the more welcome in that he never asked for troops . His tribesmen had to be armed , of course , and paid . They were not such keen nationalists as to fight for the ideal only ; indeed fighting , except in tribal feuds and forays , is not in their nature . And the allegiance of many was doubtful . I think there has been a tendency to idealize the Arab movement as if it were some great permeating wave of enthusiasm like the Italian risorgimento . Lawrence undoubtedly idealized his Bedouin ; he had to ? otherwise he could have made nothing out of them . One feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader to the material with which he works . When it comes to action , his sheiks and shereefs ? Feisal and Nasir always excepted ? seldom live up to the standard . Even old Auda ? that chivalrous name ' ? time within memory that the manhood of a tribe , with transport , arms , and food for two hundred miles , had left its district and marched into another 's territory without the hope of plunder or stimulus of blood-feud . The initiative had now passed out of the hands of the Turks , who were confined to the passive defense of Medina and the railway . Obviously the next objective in our enveloping scheme was Akaba , the nearest port to the Hejaz railway , only seventy miles distant , as against the one hundred and fifty miles from Web . The great strategic importance of Akaba was that in the hands of the Turks it threatened Sir Archibald Murray 's right flank in Palestine . Also it commanded the only road open to wheeled transport between Egypt and the Dead Sea . And , what touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the joining-up of his Arabs with the British army then in front of Gaza . To Lawrence and Feisal , Akaba meant a step on the ladder to Damascus , which they must reach at the same time as the rest of the army , or before . If they were not active and tangible in the main battlefield they would certainly lose their share of the rewards of victory . Indeed , there was very little division of counsel as to the necessity of Akaba as the new base , though there was some diversity of motive . The difficulty was in taking the place . Lawrence , who knew the terrain before the war , speaks of it as a natural defensive position of almost unequaled strength . To summarize his description : There was no covering-position to the beach , which could be shelled always from the hills . The enemy garrison was posted in these hills , in elaborate prepared positions , constructed one behind the other in a series , as far as the mouth of Wadi Rm . The Turks would be quite secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seventy miles away , was up this very Wadi Itm , and so they would be able to increase their defending force or to change its disposition at their will . The British would be able to deliver themselves from attacks only by forcing the twenty-five magnificently defensible miles of this gorge in the teeth of the enemy . The Wadi was from two to five thousand feet in depth , and often less than one hundred yards in width , and ran between fretted hills of granite whose sides were precipices hundreds of feet in height . The hundred-yard width of the bed was so encumbered by rocks that in places camels could pass only two abreast . Lawrence increased his popularity at G. H. Q. by advising against the dispatch of British troops to Akaba . He saw that the only hope of taking the place was a surprise attack from an Arab irregular force descending the Wadi Itm from the east . The Turkish defensive positions were prepared against an advance from the sea ; the idea of an attack froM inland appeared to them impossible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the area without letting the Turks know that they were being raised . It should be remembered that , in the case of a British landing , these tribes would have stood by and left the regulars to do the work , or possibly would have attacked them . That was one good reason , apart from the economical one , that raids and doubtful offensives should be left to Lawrence and his ' scallywags . ' Regular troops were of little use to him . What counted most in his success was the favor of the sheiks in whose tribal area he was fighting , and this could be secured only by Feisal . Lawrence thought Akaba was worth trying . Needless to say , he was not officially charged with the adventure , but slipped off Bedou-like into the blue , as on the occasion when he applied for ten days ' leave for a joy ride on the Red Sea . IV In the meantime the Staff was preparing to attack Medina . Lawrence had his own ideas about that , and they were entirely opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's railhead , advance base , headquarters in the Hejaz , and their strongest garrison , and it was hanging on to Damascus by the precarious eighthundred-mile thread of a single line . Nor must we forget its sentimental and political importance as one of the two Holy Places , second only to Mecca . The Arabs naturally were with the strategists . To leave Medina in the hands of the Turks was unthinkable to them . To Lawrence , however , nothing could be more undesirable than its surrender ? except , of course , its evacuation before attack . In that case the release of the garrison , with all the intermediate posts on the railway , would increase the enemy 's strength on the Beersheba front , where it was least desirable , by from twenty-five to forty thousand regulars , mostly Anatolian troops , with guns . It was due to Lawrence 's irregulars that they were pinned down in the desert , five hundred miles from anywhere , until the Armistice . For all practical purposes they were our prisoners for two years , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while their supply trains fed us . Competition to join a raid was high . Lawrence thought it all out on his sick bed at Wadi Ais , immobilized with dysentery and fever . What on earth was the good of Medina ? Its harmfulness when we had been at Yenbo was patent . The Turks in it were going to Mecca . But the move on Wejh had countered all that . And as he pondered it dawned on him that we had already won the Hejaz war . Out of every one thousand square miles nine hundred and ninety-nine were now free . ' If we held the rest the Turks were welcome to the tiny fraction on which they stood until peace or Doomsday showed them the futility of clinging to our windowpane , ' And this ' tiny fraction ' was the one spot the holding of which every soldier trained in regular warfare pronounced essential . He calculated the area the Arabs wished to deliver . A hundred thousand ? or , say , a hundred and forty thousand ? square miles . ' And how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trench line across the bottom , if we came like an army with banners ; but suppose we were ( as we might be ) an influence , an idea , a thing intangible , invulnerable , without front or back , drifting about like a gas ? . . . It seemed a regular soldier might be helpless without a target , owning only on what he sat , and at what he could poke his rifle . ' Then he calculated how many men the Turks would need to sit on all this ground and save it from our attack in depth . A fortified post every four miles was his estimate , and a post could not be less than twenty men . If so they would need 600,000 men to meet the raids of the Bedouin and his irregulars . Lawrence 's campaign then would be a war , not of contact , but of detachment . His plan was to liberate the Hejaz by making it untenable for the enemy , at a minimum cost of life to his Arabs . Many Turks on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and correspondingly we were never on the defensive except accidentally and in error . ' It suited his plan exactly to give the enemy the freedom of Medina for the duration of the war . Why , one wonders , were the Turks so demented as to stay . The German High Command , seeing the danger of envelopment , repeatedly urged them to evacuate and to abandon the line south of Maan , but Medina was the last remnant of Turkish sovereignty in the Holy Places . To hold it meant that the Caliph was still the guardian of the Prophet 's tomb . Happily sentiment won the day . And one wonders still more why our British military advisers wanted to evict them . Lawrence 's strategy appears not only sound but obvious , ? after the event , ? but we have no record that he ever converted the Staff . One wonders if Lawrence ever opened his heart about Medina to Allenby direct . Probably not . He had great tact , when tact was needed . So he gave the Staff to understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line about Maan and keep it cut . In the end , however , deception was unnecessary ; his scallywags destroyed so much of the enemy 's rolling stock that evacuation became impossible . Lawrence did not disobey orders . As a matter of fact he had no orders ? only options and requests . He just slipped away from the railway scheme to discuss his private plan for the Akaba offensive with Feisal and Auda ibn Tawi . All he withdrew from the Medina operations was his person , but that seems to have been enough . Be brewed a plan with Auda to march to the Howeitat in their spring pastures in the Sirhan , and from there to raise a mobile camel-force with Rualla and Sherarat contingents , and with their help to rush Akaba without guns or machine-guns , which could not be carried on the long and difficult desert-route . Auda was hopeful about raising the tribes . Indeed , he thought that with money and dynamite all things were possible . To stimulate keenness they carried a purse of L22,000 . Nasir , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance , was their leader . He and Auda , ? an even bigger name , who went with them to rally the tribes and lead them in battle , are the best of Lawrence 's portraits , if we except Feisal . Nasir 's mare was bespangled with enemy decorations , the spoils of a raid , a headdress of gaudy clanking Turkish medals , a panache characteristic of the ? lan and challenge of the modern Saracen . But the richest color in the scene will be associated with Auda , a sort of Arab Rustum ? a terrible and ruthless old man , given to uncontrollable impulses and passions , yet jolly and lovable , capable of freakish humors , half savage , half poet . His coming in to Feisal was a turning-point in the campaign . Lawrence describes how , when they were dining together that night , Auda scrambled to his feet and flung out of the tent with a loud ' God forbid ! ' They went out to see what was amiss and found him bent over a great rock pounding his false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten , ' he said . Jemal Pasha had these made for me . I was eating my Lord 's ( Feisal 's ) bread with Turkish teeth . ' Poor old Auda went about half-nourished after this until we had taken Akaba , when Sir Reginald Wingate sent him a dentist to make him an Allied set . The astonishing thing is that Lawrence was able to reconcile and control these untamed spirits , and to compel them , without ever letting it appear that he assumed authority , to move according to his suggestion . Constantly it was a matter of life or death to check their follies . Auda and Nasir , reenforced by the tribes , became heady with enthusiasm , and wanted to leave Akaba , an uncontained enemy-base , in their rear and attack Damascus , which they could not have held for six weeks at this stage , even if they had taken it . And to lose Damascus after capturing it would cost them the support of the tribes . Then Nesib wanted to raise a Syrian rebellion , independent of Feisal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unstable Syrians showed the wisdom of a Solomon . He headed off Nesib , and he was able to persuade Auda and Nasir that Akaba was the only door by which they could unlock Syria . At the same time he whispered to Auda that in the Damascus objective all the cash and credit would go to Nuri Shaalan . They started from Wejh in the summer heat . It was a tremendous turning movement on which they were embarking , involving a desert march of six hundred miles to carry a trench line within sight of our ships at Akaba . At the end of three weeks , after long endurance of sun and thirst and hunger , and a plague of snakes , they reached the Howeitat in the Wadi Sirhan . Another fortnight was spent in resting or replacing their camels . Their first essential objective was Aba el Lissan , sixteen miles from Maan , where there was a large spring at the head of the great pass , Naqb el Shtar , down which the road dipped from the Maan plateau . With the Arabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railway and the sea , the Turkish garrison would be starved out , and the hill tribes , hearing of their success , would come flocking down to wipe out the local posts . But it would have to be done before Turkish reenforcements could come down in strength from Maan to dislodge them . Lawrence 's plans were so well laid that the Turks were still unsuspicious . He bluffed them into thinking he was going to attack farther up the line and had designs on Aleppo and Damascus . They believed the Shereefian force was in Wadi Sirhan on the road to Jebel Druse , and sent out cavalry to intercept it . They were not anxious about Maan , since they had blown up all the wells on the desert road , leaving the Arabs no camping-ground . The surprise to the Turks was so complete that Maan would have been a negligible threat if it had not been for an accident which might have upset the whole scheme , and which forced Lawrence into one of his few imperative ' battles . It happened , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab attack on a local post , that a relief battalion of new troops from the Caucasus arrived in the station on its way south . The troops were detrained with their transport , and formed into a punitive force with pack guns and a detachment of cavalry . Thus battle was forced on Lawrence . He could not go forward to Akaba with this battalion in undisputed command of the pass . While the Turks slept in the valley the Arabs split into sections and , unobserved , crowned the hills round about them . The Bedouin poured lead into the Turks all day , but they could do nothing valid in return . ' We were no targets for their rifles , since we moved with speed eccentrically . ' The shells of their little mountain-guns burst behind the Arabs harmlessly . In the evening Auda , with fifty horsemen , charged down the slope into the Turkish infantry , huddled together under the cliff ready to cut their desperate way out to Maan at the first sign of dusk . They began to sway in and out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged down the hill on the flank to cut into the head of the rout , at a terrific uncontrollable pace , four hundred of them , extending right and left when the ground widened , and shooting into the Turkish brown ? Lawrence among them , until his camel fell and hurled him like a stone from a catapult into the middle of the Turks , where happily the carcass of his beast formed an island which diverted the fugitive stream to either side of him . He lay there half-stunned , waiting for the Turks to finish him , but when he came to himself he saw the battle already won , and the Arabs driving together and cutting down the last remnants of the enemy . They took one hundred and sixty prisoners , many of them wounded ; and some three hundred dead and dying lay scattered over the valley . The Arab dead were two . Lawrence deplored these casualties . He aspired to win a campaign without any . At the cost of two Bedouin killed he won Akaba , which would have taken three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For Aba el Lissan gave him his objective . The Turkish garrison between Moan and the coast , seeing itself cut off from support and supplies , surrendered with little resistance . Lawrence 's Arabs entered one empty post after another . The main defensive position to which the Turks retired at the mouth of Wadi Itm was now hardly tenable , with the hill tribes occupying the peaks all round and firing down into the gorges . The Turks had not considered an attack from the interior ; not one of their posts or trenches faced inland . Lawrence , of course , gives all the praise of Aba el Lissan to Auda , but one may be quite sure that the tribesmen would never have attacked without him . By themselves they were disorganized by victory and looked only to the momentary advantage . Lawrence held them in leash , and loosed them on the essential quarry . V The Hejaz campaign was finished , but there was no rest at Akaba . Five hundred irregulars , seven hundred prisoners , and two thousand allies ( as Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winning side , and expect their reward ) had to be fed , and there was nothing to feed them on except the tough and sinewy camels which had carried them to victory . So , after making dispositions for the defense of the Maan-Alutba line , he started the next morning to ride across the Sinai peninsula , one hundred and fifty miles , waterless save for one well , to Suez . He made the journey in forty-nine hours . Not a bad finish to fourteen hundred miles on a camel in four weeks in the Arabian dogdays . Lawrence felt that he deserved a bath and a change , ? his clothes were all sticking to his saddle sores , ? and a long drink with ice tinkling in the glass , and something more revivifying to eat than camel sinew . And incidentally , as we have mentioned , he had Akaba in his pocket , which would have taken three divisions of regulars to capture . But he was refused a launch across the Canal by the Inland Water Transport . That sort of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested by an Australian private as he was entering his own Damascus , and in the city he received a blow from an Australian officer , but preserved his temper and incognito . Lawrence carries himself obscurely . He does n't explain himself . I believe he liked going about unremarked and feeling that nobody knew who he was or what he had done . If he has a weakness , it is in doing big things and assuring himself and other people that he is indifferent to them , or that they are not big . Lawrence , I think , would deny that he is modest , but what vanity he possesses is his pride in his modesty , the last infirmity of genius . The dozen or more British officers who contributed to the victory on the Arab flank receive their full share of praise . Lawrence is not what you might call a hero-worshiper , but in his eyes Allenby is something like a superman . In Cairo , Allenby sent for him . I have omitted to mention that Lawrence has an individual and elfish sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crusading spirit . He watched Allenby weighing him . He could see the problem working behind Allenby 's eyes , as the latter sat in his chair looking at him ? not straight , as was his custom , but sideways , puzzled . Allenby , ' physically large and confident , and morally so great that the comprehension of our littleness was not easy to him , ' was hardly prepared for ' anything so odd as myself , a little barefooted , skirted person , preaching a Willeson strategy of communications , offering to hobble the enemy by preaching , if given stores and arms and a fund of two hundred thousand sovereigns to convince and control the converts . ' When Lawrence had finished explaining , Allenby looked at him , put up his chin , and said , ' Well , I will do what I can . ' Men with the slightest experience of the Commander-in-Chief knew that this meant everything . Lawrence was now a tooth in the big machine , no longer an independent adventurer forcing events , dropping in unexpectedly at Headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was practically the finish of the campaign in the Hejaz . Wejh was closed down . Feisal was transferred from Hussein 's command to Allenby 's . Tirs Arab forces became Allenby 's right flank , only a hundred miles from his centre . Akaba faced north , it must be remembered , to Damascus . Mecca was left behind ; the Turks still hung on to their absurd exposed position at Medina . The new part Lawrence and his Arabs had to play was in the Dead Sea campaign . Allenby wanted them to march north and link up with the British on the southern shore of the Dead Sea , to prevent the Turks getting round and attacking them in the rear ; also to cut off the enemy 's food-supplies up the Dead Sea to Jericho . Lawrence 's programme was carried out precisely according to plan . Tafileh was isolated by raids on its communications and surrendered to the Arabs , who had no casualties . The Turks then counterattacked unexpectedly and were routed , losing all their guns and machine-guns , with six hundred killed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was Lawrence 's second imperative ' engagement . Then the Arab cavalry , by a surprise attack , destroyed the Turkish flotilla at Kerak on the Dead Sea , one of the few engagements in history between horse and ships . The crews were sleeping unsuspectingly on the beach and in the reed huts near by . The destruction of the Dead Sea transport was Lawrence 's second objective ; his third , the junction with the British at the mouth of the Jordan , would no doubt have been effected had not Zeid , Feisal 's younger brother , in command on this front , diverted to his own uses the gold necessary to pay the tribes through whose country they were fighting . Lawrence resigned in disgust , but Allenby refused to let him go . The Arabs , whether as a fighting force or as political allies , had their limitations . Lawrence does not emphasize these , but from time to time we are reminded of them incidentally , as when he had to explain to Allenby that they could not attack or defend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the dogged , dependable way of troops trained in shock tactics . Nor could they stand overhead risks , or indeed casualties of any kind ; with much bombing they would break up and go home . And inaction demoralized them ; even Feisal fell to pieces when nothing was happening . A serious reverse would have nipped the Arab movement in the bud , and victory , in its local reactions , often had the same effect . After a successful foray they became no longer an organized raiding party , but just a baggage caravan stumbling along loaded to breaking-point with all the household goods needed to make rich an Arab tribe for years . ' Then they were torn by internal dissensions . Feisal could not long keep up his boast of the abatement of blood-feuds . Lawrence reminds us that the conduct of the war in France would have been harder if each division , almost each brigade , had hated every other with a deadly hatred , and fought when they met suddenly . One feels that what little idealism or national spirit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds wore my livery . ' He admired their simple virtues , but he knew exactly how far these would carry them . We were dealing with one of the shallowest and least patient races of the world . ' And he knew how the Arabs owed their strength to being geographically beyond temptation . ' The shade of a tree or running water is a luxury to the Bedouin , and with too much comfort they become corrupted . They owed their virtues , continences , and endurances to their hard , uncompromising struggle with nature . There were times when Lawrence found it difficult to raise a party for a hazard like the demolition of the Yarmuk bridges . Wealth had spoiled the men and made life too precious . VI Such was the material Lawrence had to work on , and it must be admitted that he made the most of it . The Bedou is a brave , hardy , enduring person , who believes he is the salt of the earth ; but he has not learned discipline , and probably never will , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in nobility and endurance he is unequaled . On camels Lawrence 's irregulars were independent of supplies for six weeks . They left their base with half a bag of flour , forty-five pounds in weight , strung to their riding-saddles , and half a pint of water only . Some of them never drank between wells . In summer the camels would do about two hundred and fifty miles after a watering . Thus , starting from their base with six months ' rationing , they could cover a thousand miles out and home . When their flour failed them they had two hundred pounds of potential meat under each saddle . They halted and killed their worst camel . They rode light . It was an army independent of labor or communication corps . Every unit served in the line of battle . Through economy of ammunition they were able to move without led camels , though they carried a quantity of high explosives . Most of them were qualified by rule-of-thumb lessons in demolition work . Lawrence evolved methods of his own for rapid destruction under fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy-nine bridges and culverts , apart from track and rolling stock , with his own hand . The Arabs ' part in this last phase was to keep the Turks busy on the Hejaz railway , to confirm them in their idea that the coming offensive was to be there , to prick and irritate them by continual raids , but not by any premature offensive or cumulative attrition to drive them on to the other flank where Allenby was preparing to break through . Then , when the final thrust was delivered , to cut the railway behind them at the junctions , isolating them on all three lines from their food and ammunition bases , to seize Deraa and Damascus , and to create a rising of all the tribes in their rear . To achieve this Lawrence , or Feisal , moved northward step by step , using the newly converted tribes as his ladder , as in the march to Akaba . His aim was to occupy more territory , not to force battle or to kill Turks ; and for his purpose he depended on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrain best ; also more might be expected of them , as they were defending their homes and crops . The Bedouin did not fight so well as the Arab regulars , but it was they , and not the troops , who would win the war . Feisal 's regulars Lawrence defines as ' our static side , the means of securing the fruits of tribal opportunity . ' One virtue of this system was mobility in pursuit . The ranks were refreshed by the manhood of the new clan through whose territory they were passing . Another advantage was the wide , but economical , distribution of energy . They would be fighting in one district on Monday , in another on Tuesday , and in a third on Wednesday . This fluidity of movement was the virtue of a defect , since it was difficult to combine the tribes in a raiding party on account of their suspicions and jealousies . One could not use the men of one territory in another . Lawrence characteristically discovers advantages in these limitations . ' In a real sense maximum disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains how the absence of any formal system of units must confuse the enemy 's intelligence and make it hopeless for him to gauge the Arabs ' strength at any point . Here are a few of Lawrence 's axioms , the equation of his reading with his experience . His . fighting-tactics were always tip and run , not pushes but strokes , never to maintain or improve an advantage , but to move off to strike again somewhere else , to use the smallest force in the quickest time in the farthest place . ' If our action continued until the enemy had changed his dispositions to resist it , we should he breaking the spirit of our fundamental rule of denying him targets . If the enemy brought us to action we should be disgraced technically . ' Our target was the line anywhere . The Turks defended a myriad points to cover it all , for every yard of it mattered to them . To us these points were alternatives , A few of them we wanted to take , but there was not one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freedom , were ours . ' Lawrence had not pictured himself as a commander in the field , but he became what he had to become ? strategist , diplomatist , guerrilla leader , and , among other things , expert camel-master , trained engineer , competent electrician , wise in explosives and the intricacies of demolition . His train-wrecking chapters alone contain enough thrills and hairbreadth escapes to supply a writer of books of adventure with material for a lifetime . There is nothing so intriguing as the bookworm who suddenly puts on chain armor to lead a crusade , unless it is the crusader who rests under the shadow of a rock to study the Logos and the early metaphysicians . And Lawrence was both . His Bedouin , of course , knew nothing about this , but they regarded him as a sort of superman , and they were not far from the mark . The Turks also learned his value . After the capture of Akaba they put a price on his head ? ? 20,000 alive or ? 10,000 dead . He strengthened his bodyguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of them blood enemies ; but feuds were set aside as in a Pathan company of an Indian regiment . This gave him spies , or guides to precede , accompany , or inquire for him wherever his business lay at any point of the compass . They were a loyal and proud crew ? outlaws , men with no family ties , ready to engage in any uninsurable occupation . Sixty of them died for him . Lawrence says they developed ' a professionalism almost flamboyant . ' He discovered that they had a tribunal of their own , like the prefect system in the English public schools , which flogged offenders and all who flinched . It must have been exhilarating to ride out with his singing Bedouin dressed like a bed of tulips in all imaginable colors except white , which was his own wear and therefore presumption in his bodyguard ? a poet on the right and a poet on the left , among the best singers , so that their ride might be musical . ' It hurt them that I would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the achieve-meet the more wonderful . He had to live up to his bodyguard , riding a thousand miles each month on camels , tempering the body , learning to walk barefoot , hardening the feet over sharp , pebbly , burning ground , often near breaking-point with fever and boils and thirst . He learned to lie on his belly in times of enforced fasting , for ' that prevented the inflation of foodlessness . ' His weight was less than seven stone after the fatigues and privations of the Akaba march . In the summer the heat stabbed . When they started on a raid in September the temperature was 123 ? in the shade of the palm gardens of ' cool Akaba . ' But it was in his trial of strength with the winter climate of Edom that he excelled his bodyguard . Many of them , and their camels , died of cold and overstrain . Lawrence obtained his leadership by being entirely one with his men , conforming even to their excesses and abstinences , drinking too much at wells and too little between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not understand a stranger or open their hearts to him . The least slip in etiquette , or understanding , or even in dialect , or in the knowledge of social relations between clans , may be fatal to confidence . If one can not behave like a shereef , one is cut off from esteem . Lawrence was always one of the family . The last thing he wanted , or could afford , was a badge of distinction setting up a barrier between himself and his men . The Bedouin do not understand distinctions . Lawrence , if he had any consciousness of class or race distinctions , did not show it . He kept a little aloof from his Arabs in manner , never in spirit . A display of even unconscious condescension would have estranged them . Most of the British who had dealings with them were officials . ' The veil of office , as subtle and impermeable as our veil of flesh , lay between them and the people . ' Lawrence knew exactly what an Arab felt when confronted with them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Mecca clothes he was chilled by that awful blankness in his eye which saw not a fellow man , but landscape or local color . ' He endured the beastliness of the fetid and promiscuous life among the Bedouin , gave up his privacy and his books , was bored and vermin-ridden , that he might banish from his eye this very blankness . As he worked his way north keeping step with Allenby ? it was essential that he should not be half a day too early or too late ? the tribes flocked in to Feisal 's standard . They did not want the Turks , but they were not going to show their hand before they were certain that the offensive was not a raid merely , but an occupation . The Syrian peasantry are a settled people , not like the Bedouin ; they have no desert into which to evaporate after a reverse ; their families and properties lie open to reprisals . That is why , earlier in the year , when he might have got into Damascus independently of Allenby amid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move , Lawrence held back . He doubted if he could hold the city until Allenby broke through , and to capture and abandon it would have involved the population in the most ruthless massacres . Lawrence recognized that there could be only one rising , and that that must be decisive . At the end , when the tribes of Syria entered Damascus in the Arab triumph , people turned to one another and said : Here is Feisal 's army . They have come in at the finish when all is over ' ? not knowing that these late corners were the last rung of the ladder of tribes by which Feisal , independently of Allenby , had been climbing for two years from Yenbo to Damascus . VII Lawrence saw his Arabs through , and then returned to his cloister , or hangar . He stayed only a few days in Damascus , just long enough to evolve order out of chaos , counter the intrigues against Feisal , and establish a de facto Arab government and the nucleus of an army . Then he asked Allenby to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of him . It was characteristic , this last slipping-away at the end . And on his return All Souls was not quiet enough for him , and he chose to spend his days in a seclusion less penetrable ? a numbered human unit , cleaning aeroplanes for cadets to learn to fly in . The Seven Pillars ought to be a triumphant book , but it is filled with a sense of the futility of achievement . To Lawrence victory is a sort of death : before the fruits of it were in his hands he wanted to reject them . Arabia was a great experiment , but its unimagined success killed the enjoyment of it . His delight was in the race , not in the cup . That old copybook maxim was never better illustrated than in Lawrence 's first night with his victorious Arabs in Damascus . The Muadhins began to send their call through the warm , moist night over the feasting and the illuminations of the city . From a little mosque quite near there was one who cried into my open window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I found myself involuntarily distinguishing his words . " God alone is great . I testify there is no god but God , and Mohammed the Prophet is of God . Come to prayer . Come to security . God alone is great , there is no god but God . " At the close he dropped his voice two tones , almost to speaking level , and very softly added , " And He is very good to us this day , 0 people of Damascus . " The clamor beneath him hushed suddenly , as one and all seemed to obey.the call to prayer for this first night in their lives of perfect freedom ; while my fancy showed me in the overwhelming pause my loneliness and lack of reason in their movement , since only for me of the tens of thousands in the city was that phrase meaningless . ' So all is vanity and disillusion . In the next paragraph he speaks of ' this false liberty drawn down to them by spells and wickedness . ' One is never really persuaded that he believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freedom he gave them .
