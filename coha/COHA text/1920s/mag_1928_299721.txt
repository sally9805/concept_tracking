Nominee Hoover hugged Washington to hear about the East and issue orders . National G. O. P. Chairman Work and a squad of speakers traveled to Maine , by tradition a political barometer though its Presidential readings have been only one way ( Republican ) for 52 years. * Nominee Smith spent the week concentrating on the first premise of a Democratic victory , New York State . Busiest of all , National Democratic Chairman Raskob , fourth of the Big Four , traveled from Manhattan to the Midwest , to attend Nominee Robinson 's notification , to see the farmers for himself , to lubricate local machinery , to arrange Nominee Smith 's autumn itinerary . Mr. Raskob referred repeatedly to " the goods " he had to " sell " and what good goods they were . <P> Seeing the farmers caused Mr. Raskob to ejaculate that the Farm Problem is indeed a Problem . He talked about his Eastern issue , Prohibition , hardly at all and assured the Midwesterners that they need not give it a thought during the campaign . <P> Lubricating local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be some $4,000,000 on hand . About $500,000 would go into the Corn Belt , he said , and $600,000 for the nationwide radio campaign . Lest these sums sound too large , he took care to add that he had learned " from well-advised Republicans " that the G. O. P. campaign fund , now announced as between three and four millions , would reach six or seven or even eight millions . G. O. P. Chairman Work quickly retorted that Mr. Raskob was being " absurd . " <P> More interesting to voters , however , than any of these subjects , was Mr. Raskob 's inauguration of the great political game of Claiming States . First of the Big Four to begin the game in a formal way , Mr. Raskob made his beginning a bold one . It takes 266 electoral votes to elect the President . Mr. Raskob said that " any reasonably prudent businessman would , at this time , " classify 27 States , with 309 electoral votes , in the Smith-Robinson column . He named his claims as follows : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <P> Maryland Wisconsin <P> Kentucky Minnesota <P> Tennessee Nebraska <P> Oklahoma Montana <P> Missouri Colorado <P> New York Arizona <P> New Jersey New Mexico <P> Rhode Island Nevada <P> Massachusetts <P> He said there was " little doubt " about the following States , whose 38 electoral votes would bring the Smith total to 347 : <P> Delaware North Dakota <P> Connecticut South Dakota <P> Indiana Wyoming <P> Most political predictions are met with hearty laughter by the Other Side , but Mr. Raskob was answered with jeers and booes for concluding his prediction with the following statement : " This leaves States with 184 votes , every one of which is fighting ground , and there is good indication that the Democratic ticket will corral over 100 of these . " <P> Senator Moses , Hooverizer of the East , was loudest in the Republican chorus of amazement . He said that Mr. Raskob was " chasing rainbows . " He said : " My claim of Massachusetts for Hoover is emphatic and vociferous . . . . We laugh at the Raskob claim of Nebraska . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I share Mr. Hoover 's confidence that we shall carry New Mexico and Nevada . . . etc. , etc. "
