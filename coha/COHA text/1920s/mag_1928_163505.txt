The National Crime Commission , to which national figures volunteer their energy , intelligence and time-Frank Orren Lowden as chairman of a subcommittee on pardons , penal laws and institutional correction ; Newton Diehl Baker as chairman of a committee on rehabilitating criminals and acting chairman of the whole ; Franklin Delano Roosevelt as chairman of a committee on legal education ; F. Trubee Davison as executive committeeman - last week published a report by Mr. Lowden 's committee . Written by Commissioner Louis Newton Robinson , experienced professor of economics and criminology , this report set forth , as prime cause of crime 's prevalence in the U. S. , " the lack of average intelligence in the police force , particularly in the supervisory branches . " <P> The unfortunate police force of Cleveland , Ohio , was singled out as a prime example . An Army Intelligence test given in Cleveland had revealed : <P> 3% of the patrolmen possessed Class A mentality ( as against 9% of the privates in the U. S. Army ) . <P> Not a single detective possessed Class A mentality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25% of the detectives were Class C. <P> 25% of the detectives were of " markedly inferior mentality . " <P> 33% of the patrolmen had " average intelligence . " <P> 25% of the patrolmen were morons. * <P> Cleveland came off better in a table of percentages of arrests made in murder and manslaughter cases : <P> Cleveland . . . . . . . . . . . 83% <P> England . . . . . . . . . . . . 82% <P> Baltimore . . . . . . . . . . . 68% <P> Kansas City . . . . . . . . . 36% <P> St. Louis . . . . . . . . . . . . 16% <P> The report said : " The percentages . . . are so low that one no longer wonders why so many individuals turn to crime . It would appear to be about the safest business in which one could engage . <P> " Robbery in Buffalo , for example , must be a particularly lucrative calling . As arrests are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are finally convicted is necessarily so small that the luckless individual who is occasionally caught and convicted must attribute his misfortune to an act of God , as he would in case of disastrous storm , shipwreck or earthquake . " <P> Police Chief Gerk of Baltimore protested that such figures " mean nothing . " He said : " A couple of weeks ago we arrested a man who admitted committing 100 burglaries . His pal admitted 50 . Two warrants were issued against each . Therefore , on the record , it would appear that 98 burglaries were unsolved in the case of the first man and 48 in the case of the second . " <P> From police stupidity , the report proceeded to flay lax prosecutors , loose bail systems , unreliable juries . It recommended , as a model for other cities , Detroit 's Consolidated Criminal Court . <P> <P> * Safety Director Edwin D. Barry of Cleveland protested that these figures were seven years old ; that Cleveland 's police are now intelligent .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
