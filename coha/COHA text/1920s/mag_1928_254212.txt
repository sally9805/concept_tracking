At Johns Hopkins University , no professor enjoys greater prestige than Dr. John Holladay Latane , U. S. history man . At a Smith rally , a fortnight ago , Dr. Latane said : " Speaking as a historian , I say very seriously that it is my opinion that the Society of Jesus*in the palmiest days of its history never held a nation in so firm a grasp as the ' political parsons ' of certain Protestant sects hold the United States today . Whenever I pass that large building in Washington , which overlooks the Capitol and houses of the offices of the Board of Temperance , Prohibition and Public Morals of the Methodist Episcopal Church , I feel like turning anarchist and throwing a bomb in the cellar ! " <P> Through public prints , Secretary ( Rev. Dr. ) W. H. Burgan of the M. E. T. P. P. M. replied : " Rabble-rouser ! " <P> Last week , this first-class historian or rabble-rouser or both , went to Charlottesville , Va. , to the Institute of Public Affairs . There he met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood to speak out smartly on many a public affair . But , again it was John Holladay Latane who spoke most decidedly out . Said he : <P> " Governor Smith is the first man of national prominence in this country to come forward and say what we all know to be true , namely that enforcement is a failure . Mr. Hoover does n't believe in prohibition any more than I do . " <P> Even the pro-prohibition professors applauded . They , in an outspeaking mood , were not inclined to resent outspeaking Brown Derbyism , especially since the equitable chairman of the prohibition roundtable , Prof. Governor Smith is a man for whom I have profound admiration . He is undoubtedly the greatest State Governor we have had in half a century , and I admire his honesty on the prohibition question . I also believe , because he said it , that he would lead a movement to repeal the Volstead Act and the Eighteenth Amendment . Because of the large wet element in the Democratic party , I believe he would have greater difficulty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Prof. Hatton 's round table was only one of many . Dizzy was the rate with which all U. S. ( and some foreign ) affairs spun metaphorically round and round . Thus , for example , Prof. Latane is an expert on Latin America . He knows that since 1900 , U. S. investments in the Caribbean , Central and South America have increased from the nest egg of $300,000,000 to the imperial fortune of $5,000,000,000 . As an historian he stated his fear that so much money would lead the U. S. into imperialism of the bad sort , and concluded : " We are facing one of the greatest struggles in American history , the struggle between imperialism and democracy . ' ' + <P> Equally famed as historian is William E. Dodd of the University of Chicago . He told why the Solid South might shift . But as to whether it would , he said , " The answer is not easy . " <P> Trans-Atlantic airways , the degradation of the press , State Legislatures , the Negro , the farmer , formed part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great historians and divers experts , an Italian count who long ago had a good position in Italy .
