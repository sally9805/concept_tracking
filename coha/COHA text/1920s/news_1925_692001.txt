txt ALBANY POST ROAD OPEN . It Is Said to Be Usable , Despite LeftOver Detour Signs . To the Editor of The New York Times : Contrary to reports and detour signs Posted , the Albany Post Road is now open between Croton-on-Hudson and Peekskill. and traffic is being taken care of night and day in both directions , mostly upon a portion of the newly laid concrete pavement . In the whole six miles under reconstruction there is riot now more than one-half mile of rough road , and that is passable . On about a mile and a half of this the traffic is being handled by the flag and motorcycle system , but the waits are not more than ten minutes in any case . A strip of the new concrete pavement is open from Croton to Crugers Hill . From the railroad crossing bridge , at Crugers , to Peekskill the old concrete has not been disturbed and will not be until next year . It seems to me that the motoring public ought to be informed of these facts , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed , into going fourteen miles out of the way to get a distance of six miles . I am a resident on this road and drive a car both ways several times each day , and it looks as though the contractors are taking advantage of the public in selfishly trying to keep traffic away . J. P. J. Croton-on-Hudson , N. Y. , Oct. 2 , 1925.
