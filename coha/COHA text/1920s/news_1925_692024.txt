CLEVELAND  --  The Iron Trade Review says : As new tonage from steel buyers has held up , in many cases exceeding shipments , producers are making more earnest efforts to life prices which in certain products at least are pronounced unremunerative . This week brought out a number of definite or tentative moves of this kind . Leading Pittsburgh and some independent producers have raised general quotations on structural shapes $2 a ton . ' Western mills are trying out the situation with advances on one or two minor products . Talk prevails of a $5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action in wire products . Those mancs of greater strength , however , are offset by new weakness in other directions , illustrating an unbalanced condition in the market due largely to a comparative lack of railroad tonnage . Mill bookings with certainvcceptions are gaining , but producers are inclined to be conservative in putting 011 additional capacity . Merchants bars stand out with mills filled up generally 35 to 45 days ahead and at Chicago some equipment is engaged to the year end . The Mahoning Valley sheet mills this week are running at 94% , the best this year . Railroad buying looks better now that rail orders for 1926 delivery are crystallizing.
