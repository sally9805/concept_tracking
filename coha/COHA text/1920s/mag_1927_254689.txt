" I carried a revolver charged with poisoned dumdum bullets and also a hand grenade which I had saved from the War . I intended either to shoot Mussolini or to bomb him , whichever seemed surest of success . ... I told none of my friends . I had no accomplices . I just threw the bomb .

My temperament has always been profoundly misogynistic woman-hating . . . . " <P> Such were words spoken at Rome last week by Gino Lucetti , a youth whose bomb glanced harmlessly off the limousine of Signor Benito Mussolini ( TIME , Sept. 20 ) , as the Premier was motoring slowly toward his office in the Palazzo Chigi , Rome .
