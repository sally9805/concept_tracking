Built for Northern Pacific Railroad , built by American Locomotive Co. , the most powerful locomotive in the world will soon be completed . Generating 6,000 horsepower , it could pull , over a level track , a train two miles long . For its thirst it requires 14,400 gallons of water per hour ; for its hunger , 20 tons of coal in the same period . Its firebox is the size of a portable garage . With its tender , it weighs one million pounds and is as long as half a city block . Designed chiefly for work on steep grades , it will haul across the Rockies trains that now creep slowly onward with the aid of two engines in front and a third in the rear . It will go into commission about the first of the year . <P> In spite of this best and biggest trainpuller , however , the U. S. locomotive industry is now completing its poorest year in recent history . Locomotives are a drug on the market . During the first seven months of 1928 , U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locomotive Works alone can build 3,000 locomotives a year . The railroads are not in the market for any new equipment that they can get along without , and they can easily get along without new locomotives . For they have now in storage some 6,900 engines . Many of these engines are aged , inefficient ; but most of them are still able to pull trains . <P> The foreign trade situation is as discouraging as the domestic . During the first six months of 1928 , U. S. locomotive works had shipped to foreign countries only 75 locomotives . Even this meager figure represented a rapidly falling market . On Aug. 1 , 1928 , U. S. locomotive builders were constructing 73 locomotives for foreign roads . On Aug. 1 , 1927 , they had been building 209 such locomotives , and on Aug. 1 , 1926 , there were 517 U. S. locomotives under construction for the export trade . Thus the 1928 export production has shrunk to about one-seventh of its 1926 figure . <P> There are only three U. S. manufacturers of locomotives . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Works , Inc . The Lima company is so much smaller than the other two that the locomotive industry is often thought of in terms only of American Locomotive and Baldwin . All three companies are running at far below capacity ( the Lima plant , indeed , shut down temporarily during the latter part of 1927 ) . <P> Sharp contrasts are William H. Woodin , head of the American Locomotive Co. , and Samuel M. Vauclain , head of the Baldwin Locomotive Works . Mr. Woodin has probably the finest collection of American gold pieces in the world , has written authoritatively on numismatics . A collector of rare books , he especially prizes a volume which contains signatures of most of the Popes of Rome . A present hobby is the collection of originals of newspaper cartoons . Mr. Woodin plays little golf ; seldom uses his costly yacht . He is a graduate of Columbia ( school of mines , 1890 ) and an Alpha Delta Phi , was Fuel Administrator in New York State during the coal strike of 1922 , ran for Congress unsuccessfully in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is 60 . Believing strongly in self-control , he stops smoking one month each year to demonstrate that he is no tobacco-slave.
