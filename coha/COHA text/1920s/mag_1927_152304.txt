At the University of Minnesota , girl students linger after lectures to talk to the instructor . During class they sit near the professor 's desk , giggle merrily at his pedagogical jests , smile understandingly at his well-known eccentricities , make their pretty eyes look deep and sympathetic when he comes to the point of his discourse . Thus do the wily coeds , whose actual intelligence measures but 25 on a scale of 100 , compensate for a ten-point deficiency in intellect , and extract grades equal to those attained by charmless male students whose measure of intelligence on the same scale is 35 . Authority for this condition is Dr. George Thomas , president of the University of Utah , who lately cautioned his faculty members to guard against such insidious influence , prevalent in most co-educational institutions .
