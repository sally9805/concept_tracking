THE CLOSED GARDEN-Julian Green-Harpers ( $2.50 ) . <P> The Story . There was no story , and that was Adrienne 's trouble . Suppressed by a middle-class father concerned only that the arid monotony of his existence , be undisturbed , guarded by her sickly sister , the village spinster who envied youth and health and beauty , Adrienne was starved for drama . She could but set the stage-parlor furniture to dust in the morning , geraniums to cut by the garden gate-and wait in vain for the hero . From an upper window she watched for him , a middle-aged neighbor . The sharp ledge cut into her arms , the heavy scent of summer flowers filled her with longing , but her neighbor kept to himself . Adrienne tossed sleeplessly at night , traced listlessly the immutable pattern of her dull existence , suffered torments from her suspicious parent . <P> But there came a time when her tormentor was , instead , a self-seeking woman of questionable reputation , who insinuated in saccharine tones that Adrienne had of course murdered her father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her unrequited love , Adrienne rushed from the house , muttering confused reminiscences of a mind gone mad . <P> The Significance . Andr Maurois in-itroduces Author Green as " the best novelist of his generation . " Others have declared him Balzacian , and murmured of Emily Bronte 's Wuthering Heights , for his uncanny realism is not of the modern self-conscious variety . Master of detail-heavy odor of wistaria over the garden wall , crunch of wheels on the gravel , pebbles shaping the brook into a plaited pattern-no single word is superfluous , and each image blends into an unforgettable whole . <P> As a writer Julian Green shows unmistakable talent , as a psychologist he is convincing beyond question , but as a novelist he has yet to achieve something of universality . As in his first novel , Avarice House , not a single character has charm or kindness-nothing but selfishness , fear , jealousy . Adrienne is said to be beautiful , but her submissiveness , her exasperating inhibitions , make her so unattractive that it is difficult to be as sorry for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Critics ' jargon had it in France that none but a foreigner could have observed the cloistered intolerance of French village life with such dispassionate accuracy , and none but an American would have taken a young girl 's first love so seriously . Perhaps they knew that though Author Julian Green has lived most of his 27 years in France , and has always written in French , he was born of American parents , and studied a few years at the University of Virginia .
