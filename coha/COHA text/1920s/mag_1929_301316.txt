Porter v. Dewar <P> Sirs : <P> Readers of TIME will enjoy this characteristic bit of repartee attributed to the " venerable Baron Dewar , who claims that whiskey is his muse " : <P> Miss Porter-Porter , who considered her compound appellation a social asset of considerable potency , became indignant when the Noble Lord chose to ignore the repetition . <P> " My name is Porter-Porter , " she emphasized , " - with a hyphen . " <P> " To be sure , " came the adroit reply , " And mine is Dewar-Dewar , - with a siphon . " <P> JOHN S. GARTH <P> Long Beach , Calif . <P> And Soon ! <P> Sirs : <P> TIME 'S Editor is tall and thin , <P> He and Roget are next-of-kin , <P> Thesaurus is his middle name , <P> Terseness his very end and aim . <P> He stalks the shy , uncommon word <P> To give the inarticulate herd Vocabularies wide and weird <P> And potent as the Prophet 's beard . <P> He passes by ' galloon , ' ' simoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and ' loon , ' <P> But he 's married himself to the word ' tycoon .

J. <P> Word <P> Sirs : <P> I note the following in the Chicago Herald and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashton Stevens <P> I have just been struck in the eye by a fearful word in the dramatic column of my last week 's copy of TIME , " the weekly news magazine , " that counts among its duties that of teaching the dailies their manners . And I am wondering if drama critics are to become corrupted by the plays they are paid to see . This is a word that might be spoken on the stage in so frank and veristic a production as The Front Page , but uttered at a decent dinner table it would impel a Victorian butler to practice on the loose-lipped guest what is technically known as the bum 's rush . . . . <P> LUTHER T. WILSON <P> Chicago , Ill . <P> The word that shocked Critic Stevens was a Latin-derived synonym for stage-hackneyed Sex-a synonym seldom heard outside biology . TIME approved the word 's scientific quality and doubts that the most prurient-minded of Victorian butlers would have suspected what was meant. - ED . <P> Atoms <P> Sirs : <P> The Dramatic Critic of TIME has fused scientific accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny secret stars that whirl in thumbnail welkins.
