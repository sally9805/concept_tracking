Throughout the Soviet Union it is a grim jest to say that neither the Voice of God nor that of the People can be heard above the silence of Comrade Josef Stalin . Always shabbily dressed , the Dictator prefers to dominate Russia from his unobtrusive post of Secretary of the Communist Party-the only political group permitted to exist . Even at party gatherings Secretary Stalin habitually sits in watchful silence on the back row of a crowded speakers ' platform . Therefore when the man whose name means " Steel " suddenly chose to speak , last week , before the Central Committee and the Central Control Committee of the Communist Party , his few words were treasured up as pregnant oracles . <P> Rustication . The Dictator sternly warned party executives that they must not lose contact with the masses , nor ignore or stifle criticism , nor fail to take effective precautions in advance of looming difficulties . Each of them must spend , he said , at least one month per year in the provinces , doing local party work . <P> Grain Hoarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained upon the Peasant Squires or " Fists " who hoarded their grain during the last three months of 1927 and finally produced something very like an artificial famine ( TIME , Feb. 27 ) . <P> " These Kulak speculators , " rasped M. Stalin , " shall be prevented from ever again attempting to starve the Red Army and the urban Proletariat . " <P> As everyone knows , the recent " speculators ' famine " was broken by sending through the provinces bands of strong-arm grain collectors who literally forced the peasants to sell their hoarded grain at the fixed prices offered by the State . <P> Economic Intervention . Lastly , Dictator Stalin stated with apparent deadly seriousness that the Capitalistic Powers , having failed to penetrate Russia by " military intervention " in 1918-20 , are now seeking to subvert the Soviet State by " economic intervention carried out by bourgeois technicians . " <P> M. Stalin explained that he referred especially to the six German engineers who were recently arrested in the new <P> Russian industrial region of the Don and charged with " counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been released , despite the repeated protests of the German Government . <P> Apparently M. Stalin is convinced that even the few foreign technicians who have been imported to teach Russians the tricks of industrial trades now constitute a counter-revolutionary menace and are subsidized by the Capitalist Powers . <P> He concluded : " For the future there are only two possibilities . Either we pursue our revolutionary policy in organizing the proletarians suppressed in all countries around the working class of the Soviet Union-in this case international capital will attempt to prevent our promotion by all means-or we abandon our revolutionary policy and make a number of concessions to international capital . In the latter case international capital possibly would be willing to assist us to degenerate our Socialist State into a bourgeois republic . <P> " But , since we can not make concessions in principle without abandoning ourselves , we must be prepared that international capital will continue to wrong us in all ways .
