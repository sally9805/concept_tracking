txt Among the tax provisions which have been approved by the Chamber Finance Commission is a clause which if enacted into law and enforced might ruin the American colonies in France , the population of which now runs into the tens of thousands , and cause a general ' movement westward of resident American millionaires . This provision says that foreigners living in Prance or possessing property here must in future declare their full revenues from all sources and pay taxes on them according to the French schedule . Enforcement of such a law might have one of two effects ? either drive rich Americans out of France or else bring them to make income tax declarations along the lines which show that 40,000,000 Frenchmen earned last year 28,000,000,000 francs , or an average of $25 each above the exemption of 7,000 francs . Since the war the American colonies in Francs have grown by leaps and bounds and a conspicuous class of these emigres from the United States has been people of leisure having moderate incomes who get more for them in France than they would in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a larger scale . In addition there are a great many rich Englishmen and Americans who own houses in France , especially villas at resorts , where they spend a ten- months each year . There are at present 67,000 Americans living in France . French Jealousy Aroused . The amount of gold style money these Americans have spent within the confines of their sister republic has never compensated the Frenchman 's feeling that he is getting the worst of it because the American with dollars could buy many things he could not afford . The difficulty of getting these Americans to make income tax returns and the further difficulty of French verification of those returns caused the Poincare Government to pass a law by the terms of which a foreigner could square himself with the tax authorities by paying income tax on seven times the amount of his rent , it being calculated that on an average the seventh of a family 's income goes to his landlord . This was generally accepted by foreign residents in France and the law has been generally observed . But the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him was a very small income tax has stirred the ire of Socialist and near-Socialist solons , who have a majority in the Chamber . so it is now the open season on rich foreigners , which means Americans and English . Experts of other countries have often told the French that the trouble with their income tax is that it is too high . I Starting around 16 per cent . after the initial exemption of 7,000 francs , it mounts in agile fashion until an income of 500.000 francs , or roughly $25 , - 000 , pays one-half  --  that is if the tax collectors can get it . Suppose a man had an income of 81,000,000. which is the good fortune of a number of Americans and English- i men who own places in France ; he would , if the new proposal were made law , owe the French Government about $800,000 a year and in America or England he would owe sufficient to bring his income tax up to more than 100 per cent Of course no such tax is going to be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sale of French estates by rich foreign owners , which would certainly cause a falling off in the value of high-class real estate . The matter would become serious for Americans working in France . The is : : : on an income of $10,000 would be about $3,000 and on $15,000 it would be about $5,000 . Full Tax Not Paid by Frenchmen . Of course it is easy to argue , as the Socialists do , that the foreigners living in France should pay the same income tax as the Frenchman . The answer is that Frenchmen do not pay the full tax and the question will be whether foreigners will pay . There will always be the same difficulty of verification of declarations , and a guess is that . foreigners will drift along on the principle dictated by the old adage ' which says when in Rome do as the Romans do . Last year 264 Frenchmen declared revenues in excess of 1,000,000 francs , or 540,000 . There are at least 364 Americans living or holding property in France who have incomes greater than ibis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ francs , or 54,000 . The Journal is authority for the statement that in France only 25 per cent of income tax due is paid . It points out that there are 352.000 pleasure automobiles in France , whereas 196,000 people declared taxable income of 30,000 francs ; which ls to say it is indicated that there are 150,000'Frenchmen in France who have pleasure cars and an income of less than 51.200 , and this recalls the old saying that the French are an economical people . All this raises the question as to what course the rich foreigner in France is to pursue if , this bill is passed . Must he leave the country pr must he fool the taxgatherer ? Of course , the proposal represents the efforts of amateurs to solve a difficult problem , and doubtless before it goes much further somebody who knows something about it will tell the Chamber it is an unwise move .
