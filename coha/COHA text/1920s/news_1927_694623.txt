Although most of us would classify such a night in the woods as a hardship , we found that the gllides and fur - hunters in the moose country which we visited a few weeks ago thought little of . bivouacking a night out and then ! snowshoeing all the next day with Practically nothing to eat . we were much interested in iearning how these guides Prepare bivouac for the night when It is bitterly cold .

As a result , places , which are pretty well protected from ' the prevailing winds are numerous . The site selected , the boys then shoveled away the snow where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow shovels , and while one is busy with these tools the other I guide takes his ax to cut a big pile 1 of firewood .

If the snow is three feet deep , you now have a hole that deep for a shelter and the groultd thawed . The fire is moved to the lee ' side of the hole and boughs placed on the warm ground ' Where the guides are to stretch out .

A cup of tea , a roast leg of rabbit killed that afternoon , and there you are  --  ready for a forty below zero night .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
