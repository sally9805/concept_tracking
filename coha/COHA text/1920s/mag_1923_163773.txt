" I took Nuxated Iron faithfully all through my training , " said Jack Dempsey at his Shelby headquarters after the 15-round fight in which he retained his world 's championship by decision over Tom Gibbons . In an extended interview given to a representative of this singular specific , Dempsey revealed secrets that should virtually revolutionize the progress of the prize ring . It seems that Dempsey has taken large quantities of the Iron as a staple of his training diet before all his championship struggles . <P> Thinking people will discern immediately that Dempsey has taken a false step . In fact , his ingenuous enthusiasm for this vialled virility seems for the moment to have swept him off his feet . Not only has the fighter become involved in this strategic blunder , but his manager as well . Jack Kearns , whose brain held up Shelby and the nation for $100,000 , has forgotten himself so far as to give away the secret of his success . He , too , admits that Nuxated Iron is vital to his champion 's " phenomenal victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where credit is due ; it is quite another to imperil one 's livelihood by excessive feelings of gratitude . Dempsey and Kearns , in their blind enthusiasm , have given to Tom Gibbons the key to his one vital shortcoming . He lacked that ounce of ferocity , that ecstasy of endurance that Nuxated Iron , according to the implication of Dempsey 's statement , alone can give . <P> Now that the cat is out of the bag it remains only for Gibbons to nourish himself with Nuxated and knock the champion frigid in their next encounter . <P> The more obvious aspects of the battle showed that Dempsey 's twoyears of idleness have mellowed his potency . No longer can he pulverize with a punch . No longer , indeed , can he always " connect " with that punch . His speed has lost its deadliness ; his eye has fallen into error . <P> Gibbons displayed a sound defensive strategy . He ran away . He lives to fight another day when the gate receipts will be bigger .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
