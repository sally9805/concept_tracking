Cactus , Duck <P> Sirs : <P> Will TIME 'S expression : " dry as a cactus " hold water ? Desert travelers sometimes split a barrel cactus in half , squeeze the pulp through a cloth , get a cup of sweetish water . The giant cactus , a mass of pulp held together by fibrous ribs , absorbs water on rainy days and swells out like a toad . Woodpeckers drill holes in the trunk , occupy them . <P> An eminent naturalist ( Dr. Horniday ) tells of a duck disappointed with prohibition , who retired to the desert . Selecting a suitable giant cactus , she shoved out the woodpecker tenants and moved in . It was cool and comfortable , had running water in every room . In this rustic solitude she spent her declining years . On summer evenings she might have been observed sitting by an open window , her bright green head thrust out in an attitude of expectancy , a sharp eye peeled for passing worms and unsuspecting bugs . <P> <P> JIM SHINE <P> Grand Canyon , Ariz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was interested in the fifth correction of Herbert Janvrin Browne in LETTERS of Oct. 29 . " Incidentally , " Mr. Browne writes , " less is known about the slumber habits of horses than of any other domestic animal . " That may be , but I have had experience which proves to me , at least , that horses do sleep , and with a vengeance , too . <P> It was the " privilege " last summer of my brother and myself while sojourning in Yellowstone National Park ( waiting for a motorcycle repair part ) to spend a night in the horse stable of Old Faithful Camp . Not accustomed to such lodging ( though the hay was comfortable enough ) we slept little , and had a good opportunity to observe the nocturnal habits of the six horses tied to the opposite side of the manger . For the first hour or two they munched noisily on hay . Tiring of this , they would bite each other on the neck in a friendly way , or would spray us violently through their nostrils . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls and the manger ( beneath which we lay ) , and stamping about as though to shake the flimsy structure to pieces . <P> At length ( about one in the morning ) they quieted down , and , I firmly believe , went to sleep . They were the most human-sounding beasts I have ever met ! All the grunts , sighs , groans , wheezes , and measured snores of human sleep were reproduced in a generous but exact replica . One snored so persistently that one of our hobo companions woke , swore sleepily , and with a stick rapped the offender into startled wakefulness and silence . Perhaps some of your other subscribers have had similar first-hand experience . <P> <P> M. THURSTON WARD <P> Gary , Ind . <P> <P> Somebody Knows <P> Sirs : <P> Thank you so much for the article in TIME . I am turning it over to my Business Manager .
