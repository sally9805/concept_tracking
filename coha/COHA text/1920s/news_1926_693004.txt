He was taken to a cell by a deputy sheriff . Byrnes , the next witness , was similarly disposed of when he refused to answer the question : " Are you the owner of the building at 9 Woodlawn Avenue ? " " Might Incriminate Me . " When Fennell 's time came he was asked what business he conducted at the Phila Street place . " I refuse to answer on the ground that it might incriminate me , " he said . " All right . I 'll incarcerate you , " the Court replied . " Take him out with the others ! " The Judge ordered the official stenographer to prepare commitment papers for the men . He left town without relenting and they languished in jail tonight .
