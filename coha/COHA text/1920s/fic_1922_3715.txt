PRESS OF BRAUNWORTH &; CO . BOOK MANUFACTURERS BROOKLYN , N.Y . THE LITTLE MIXER There was no fault to be found with the present itself ; the trouble lay in the method of transportation . This thought was definite enough in Hannah 's mind , but she had to rely upon a seven-year-old vocabulary for expression , and grown-ups are notably dull of comprehension . Even mothers do n't always understand without being told exactly in so many words . " I did n't say the kimono was n't nice , Mama , " explained Hannah , " and ' course Cousin Carrie was awful good to send it to me , but -- but Santy Claus is going to bring Virginia one to-morrow night , down the chimbley ! " Rose Joseph slipped the absurd little garment over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair that she might view herself in the narrow mirror between the windows of the living-room . The child was as lovely as a flower , but vanity was still sound asleep in her soul , and she glanced indifferently at the reflection , her body sagging with disappointment . " It is just like those little Japanese girls wear , " her mother cried in that over-enthusiastic adult tone which warns a child he is about to be the recipient of a gold brick . " I am sure Virginia 's ca n't be any nicer than this one ! " " But , Mama , Santy Claus is going bring hers down the chimbley . Mine "  - -  her voice dropped to a mournful key --  " mine came through the door ! " " But , darling , what difference does that make just so you get it ? " Pity for her mother 's barren childhood shone in Hannah 's soft black eyes . " That's -- that 's no way for presents to come , " she explained ; " Mama , it 's Chris'mus . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember you are a Jewess , dear . " " I ca n't never forget it , " said the child with a catch in her voice , " ' specially at Chris'mus . " " But , darling , the Jewish children have Chanuca ; it comes about the same time as Christmas , and amounts to the same thing . " Hannah shook her bronze curls . " Chanuca is because the children of Israel took Jerusalem and the temple away from the bad people , " she recited glibly , " and -- and you say prayers , and light candles -- eight days , and -- and all your uncles and aunts and cousins send you things , but Santy Claus , he do n't pay any ' tention to Chanuca . Chris'mus is just one day , and Santy Claus comes down the chimbley and brings things to all good children -- 'cept little Jews -- because it is the birthday of our Saviour . " Mrs. Joseph was silent so long that Hannah felt she had convinced her mother of the superiority of the Gentile Christmas over the Jewish Chanuca , and she continued more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give Santy Claus money , and tell him what to buy , and he brings the presents , and nobody has to bother about it ' cept him . " " Hannah , " Mrs. Joseph interrupted coldly , " who told you about the birthday of -- of the Saviour ? " " Nellie Halloran , " answered Hannah , " and Virginia , too . They've -- they 've got the same one . " " The same what ? " " The same Saviour , " Hannah explained . " Darling , has n't Mama told you many times , that you must never , never talk about religion to Nellie and Virginia ? " " Oh , we do n't , Mama , never , never ! But ' course we got to talk about Santy Claus , and things . " There seemed to be no reasonable objection to that , so Mrs. Joseph dropped the subject . She spent a great deal of time folding the despised and rejected kimono into its tissue-paper wrappings . Presently she brought a narrow parcel from another room . " See what Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaily . " A little man ; you wind him up in the back with this key -- so -- and then he dances and plays the fiddle ! " Hannah forced a polite giggle at the little man 's antics . He too rested under the ban of having come " through the door , " and her attention soon wandered . " Nellie got a jumping-jack in the very top of her stocking last Chris'mus ; ' cause she 's such a jumping-jack herself , her papa said . You know , Mama , Santy Claus puts nuts and candy , and little things in your stocking and puts your big things all around the room . Sometimes he brings a tree and hangs them all on a tree . Virginia and Nellie want a tree and a new doll . Virginia gets a new doll every Chris'mus , and she 's got every doll Santy ever brought her -- even her little , baby , rubber doll . She 's eight years old and will have eight dolls ! But Nellie ain't -- has n't saved a single one , and she 's scared she wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear ? " asked Mrs. Joseph , when Hannah paused for breath . " Because the doll Santy brought Nellie last Chris'mus , you know what ? She was playing Indian with her brother one day , and chopped her head off ! And Nellie 's mama says she do n't know whether old Santy 's going to forget that or not ! But Nellie , she says she prays hard to the Virgin Mary every night -- if she do n't go to sleep too quick . Mama , what 's a virgin ? Mama , what's --  --  " " A virgin is a lady who has never been married , " answered Mrs. Joseph , putting the neglected musician back into his box . Hannah wrestled alone for a moment with a mighty ecclesiastical problem , and then gave it up . " The Virgin Mary is God 's mother , " Hannah continued . " That 's her picture over our fireplace , "  - -  pointing to a copy of a crude thirteenth century Madonna and Child in a carved Gothic frame , which Eli and Rose Joseph had bought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candles burning in silver candelabra in honor of Chanuca , it gave the mantel a passing resemblance to a Catholic shrine . " I do n't think God 's mother is very pretty , do you , Mama ? And I think Nellie 's little brother is a heap prettier'n God was when He was a baby . " Mrs. Joseph showed signs of having reached the limit . " Hannah , " she said firmly , " it is time you were in bed . " " But , Papa has n't come home yet . " " Papa will be late to-night , dear . " " The Chris'mus rush , " sighed Hannah . " Mama , you have n't looked down my throat to-day , " she added , playing for time . Mrs. Joseph went through the daily ritual . " It looks all right , " she pronounced . " It is all right , " came the triumphant answer . " It is never going to be sore again . Virginia says --  --  " " Never mind what Virginia says . If your throat ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to me instantly and tell me . Do you understand ? " " Yes , Mama , but it is n't going to hurt any more , " Hannah insisted . " Come on up-stairs to bed . " Still Hannah hung back . She had not played her trump card yet , and the time was short . She caught her mother 's slim white hand in hers and fingered nervously at the rings . " Mama , " she almost whispered , " Virginia says it 's Jewish mamas ' fault that Santy Claus do n't come to see Jewish children . If the mamas would just go to Santy and tell him to come -- You will , wo n't you , Mama ? Please , Mama ! " " Hannah , not another word about Christmas and Santy **25;3505;TOOLONG ! " Hannah swallowed something that came in her throat , and bravely winked back her tears . " Ca n't Mandy put me to bed ? " " No , dear ; Mandy is busy in the kitchen . Mama will put you to bed and tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderly . Hannah flung her arms about her mother 's neck . She loved the feel of the soft throat and the gently curving bosom against her little cheek , and the fragrance of her mother 's hair and silken laces . She did n't know that her mother looked like a portrait by Raphael , but she did know that her mama was the prettiest , sweetest mama in all the world ; and yet --  " Mama , I 'm so tired of stories about the children of Israel . They never did anything funny . Mandy tells me tales about the old plantashun , when her ma was a slave , and about ole Marse , and ole Mis ' going to town and giving Santy Claus money so 's he 'd bring beads and ' juice ' harps and things to the little niggers ; and he never forgot one , from the biggest to the littlest darky , Santy did n't . " The child 's body began to tremble with repressed sobs . " I -- I wisht I was a -- a little darky ! It's -- it 's awful -- sad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then the storm broke . Two hours later Eli Joseph 's tired step sounded on the veranda , and Rose hurried to admit him , lifting a silencing hand as soon as he had crossed the threshold . " Hannah has just gone to sleep , " she whispered . " No -- no , she 's not sick at all . " He placed an arm around her and drew her into the library . " Eli , your overcoat is wet , " she exclaimed , untwining her arms from his neck . " Snow , " he said , his good-looking boyish face lighting up with pleasure . " It seems we are to have a white Christmas after all . " " Christmas ! " she cried ; " I wish I could never hear that word again . " " Well , I 'm glad it comes only once a year . To-night ends my siege , though . To-morrow night Stein goes on duty , and I come home for dinner to stay . Rose , darling , you look all tired out . You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that . It 's Hannah . She cried for more than an hour to-night , and but for Mandy and her tales I believe she would still be crying . " And she detailed the scene to him . " But , good gracious , Rose , let Santa Claus bring her presents to her , " said Eli , when she had finished . " Hannah 's nothing but a baby . " " She is beginning to think for herself . " " As you did at a very early age , " he reminded her , " and your father the strictest of orthodox rabbis . How old were you when you began slipping off to the reformed temple ? " " I broke my father 's heart , " she said somberly . " I 'll be punished through Hannah . " " Not unless you let Hannah think faster than you do . And remember , " he added teasingly , " if you had n't run off to the reformed temple you would never have met me . " " Outside , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would never have met you inside . " " Maybe I am lax , " he acknowledged , " but it seems to me that if you are living a decent life yourself , and giving the other fellow a square deal , you are pretty nearly fulfilling the law and the prophets . " " And what do you suppose is happening to Hannah with a Christian Science family on one side and Roman Catholics on the other ? " she demanded tragically . " She 's decided not to take any more medicine , because Virginia Lawrence does n't . And she has Nellie Halloran 's every expression about the Virgin and the Saviour . Not only that , but she has made friends with a Christian Science practitioner through the Lawrences , and calls him ' my friend Mr. Jackson . ' She runs to meet him and walks the length of the block with him every time he passes . " " Hannah is certainly a natural born mixer , " laughed the father . " We are saving ourselves trouble by giving her the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am afraid we made a mistake moving out here , away from all our people . " " No , we did n't make a mistake , " he declared earnestly . " The Square was no place to bring up Hannah , among those parvenu Jews . We have the prettiest home on the heights and the best people in town for neighbors . " " Our child is losing her identity as a Jewess . " " Let her find it again as an American , " he replied . " Frankly , Rose , I do n't lose any sleep over trying to keep my identity as a Jew intact . If a Jew does n't like it here , let him go back to Palestine or to the country that oppressed him , I say . I 've got the same amount of patience with these hyphenated Americans as I have with the Jews who try to segregate themselves and dot the map with New Jerusalems . Where 's the sense in throwing yourself into the melting-pot , glad of the chance , and then kicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , dear ; you are as pale as a ghost , and I 'm so tired I ca n't see straight . Our baby is all right . Do n't you worry . " * * * * * Snow falls on the just and the unjust . There was quite as much of it in Hannah 's back yard as in either Virginia 's or Nellie's -- perhaps even a little more had drifted into the fence corners . Hannah 's joy in discovering that in this respect she had not been slighted crowded her troubles into the background . Immediately after breakfast , bundled up snugly , she stood in her yard and threw snowballs toward her neighbors ' homes , while she squealed with delight . In a very few minutes , three little girls were playing where only one had played before . The two newcomers , Virginia Lawrence and Nellie Halloran , presented an interesting contrast . Virginia , slim , and tall for her age , with long , flat , yellow braids , handled the snow daintily , even gingerly . Nellie , fat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rolled over and over in the snow , and then shook herself like a puppy . Until the advent of Hannah , a subtle antagonism had existed between the two children . Virginia 's favorite game was playing " lady " with a train floating gracefully behind her ; Nellie 's chief joy in life was seeing how long she could stand on her head , her short skirts obeying the laws of gravity all the while . Hannah , however , vibrated obligingly between the two sports , and kept the peace inviolate . Romping in the snow is hard play , and presently the little girls sat panting on the top step of the Josephs ' back porch . Immediately Nellie produced a string of amethyst colored beads from her coat pocket , with the announcement that she would say her prayers while resting . " What kind of beads are those ? " asked Hannah . " Rosary beads , ' course , " responded Nellie . " Hannah , you do n't know anything . " " I do , too . " " Huh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God until I told you . " " I reckon I thought God was an orphan , " Hannah pleaded in extenuation . " But , what about God 's papa ? " she demanded with sudden inspiration . " You 're so smarty , tell me about that ! " " Oh , God did n't have to have a father , " Nellie answered easily . " Everything is free in Heaven ; so He did n't have to have a father to work for Him when He was little . " " Then why did He have to have a mama ? " " To tell Him what to do , ' course . You know how ' t is . If you ask your papa anything , do n't he always say , ' Go ask your mama ' ? " Hannah had noticed this shifting of masculine responsibility more than once . " That 's so , " she acquiesced . Then a terrible thought struck her . " I do n't want to go to Heaven ! I do n't want to go anywhere unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish wits were ready . " I just said God did n't need any papa . ' Course our papas will go to Heaven , ' cause that 's the only place they can quit working . Did n't I hear my papa say one time he hoped he 'd get a little rest in Heaven , ' cause he never got any on this earth ? " " But , you have to die before you can get to Heaven , " sighed Hannah . Virginia , who had been maintaining a most dignified silence , looked as if she must speak or explode . " No you do n't . Heaven begins here and now , " she recited . " If you are good , you are well and happy , and that 's Heaven . " " ' Tis n't , " scoffed Nellie . " Do you see any angels flying ' round in this here yard ? I do n't . " Hannah rather took to Virginia 's argument , and resolved to have conversation with her some time , undampened by Nellie 's skepticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven here and now , Hannah had every intention of being at the banquet table . At the present moment , however , the rosary beads were of fascinating interest ; she must hold them in her own hands , and watch the play of purple lights upon the snow as she flashed them in the sun . Questions about the crucifix , she found , brought on an embarrassing silence . Nellie looked at Virginia . Virginia looked at Nellie . Then the two excused themselves for a whispered colloquy at the other end of the yard . When they returned , Virginia acted as spokesman , fixing Nellie with an unrelenting eye . " That is Jesus nailed to the cross , Hannah . Some very wicked people did it . " There was nothing exciting in this to Hannah ; wicked people were doing wicked things the world over , all the time . The statement fell flat , and Nellie , disappointed at the lack of dramatic effect , broke treaty . " I ' spect the Jews did it , " she said . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Jews are nice people ; they would n't do a wicked thing like that ! " Virginia put an arm across Hannah 's shoulders . " Now see what you 've done , " she snapped at Nellie . " Oh , I ' spect the Irish helped them , " Nellie added magnanimously . " My papa says the Irish are into every thing . " Not having to bear the ignominy alone Hannah was comforted . " What makes you say prayers on the beads ? " she asked . " ' Cause I want Santy to bring me a doll to-night . I wrote him ' bout sixteen letters , and I 'm going to say my rosary a dozen times to-day . " To-morrow was Christmas Day ! Hannah 's face fell . All her sorrows returned with a rush . " Have you got any more of those beads ? " she asked . " Yes , but they would n't do you any good , " Nellie answered with quick understanding . " You 're not a Catholic . " " Could n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with holy water . The priest does it . " The leaven had begun to work . " What did your mama say about asking Santa Claus to come ? " Virginia inquired , with a quick glance toward the beads . Hannah shook her head , speechless . She compressed her lips into a tight line with an effort at self-control , but two large tears rolled down her cheeks and splashed on her scarlet coat . Again Virginia placed an arm protectingly across Hannah 's shoulder . Nellie 's bright blue eyes grew soft with pity . " I tell you what , " she exclaimed . " I 'll baptize Hannah , then she 'll be a Gentile , and Santa Claus will come , no matter what . And when your mama sees how nice it is , she wo n't care . " " But , you said a priest has to baptize anybody , " objected Virginia . " He does ' less it 's a time of danger and you ca n't get any priest . Then any Catholic can baptize anybody . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it was going to die before Father Murphy could get there . And ai n't this a time of danger ? " " Nobody 's dying . " Virginia was distressingly literal . Hannah looked from one friend to the other , hoping against hope . " No , but there 's danger Santa Claus wo n't come to see Hannah less'n sump'n is done mighty quick , " came Nellie 's ready reply . " And can we get a priest ? You go get one , Virginia . Go get one . " Clearly there was no answer to this . The ceremony was set for early afternoon when Grandmother Halloran took her nap and Nellie could borrow the bottle of holy water from her shelf . As to the place , there were six boys at the Hallorans ' always in the way ; Mrs. Lawrence had guests ; obviously the baptismal rite would have to be performed at Hannah 's home . After lunch the children assembled in the sun parlor of the Josephs ' home , in full view of Mrs. Joseph who sat embroidering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that she did not hear . Nellie had secured the bottle of holy water , and , arrayed in her brother Joe 's long , black rain-coat , a towel about her neck for a stole , acted as priest . Virginia , not to be left out of such an important affair , consented to be godmother . In lieu of a prayer manual , Nellie used one of Hannah 's story books . She chose a verse , which , because she knew it by heart , she could read exceptionally well : " Little boy blue , come blow your horn , The sheep are in the meadow , And the cows are in the corn . " Then she poured a little of the holy water on Hannah 's forehead ( wet hair might occasion unanswerable questions ) and baptized her " Hannah Agnes Ignatius Joseph . " Called upon for a response , the godmother recited very impressively the Scientific Statement of Being as found in the Christian Science text-book , and Hannah was pronounced a Gentile and a Catholic . One thing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheeks aglow . " Mama , may I trade my striped ball to Nellie for some beads ? " " Why of course , darling , if you wish . " The exchange was made , and some time was spent in mastering the use of the rosary . All three of the children knew the " Our Father , " though there was some difference of opinion as to " debts " and " trespasses " which is apt to hold in all mixed congregations . The " Hail Mary " proved a bit difficult for Hannah , and she finally abandoned it . " I 'll say , ' Hear , oh Israel , the Lord our God , the Lord is One , ' " she said . " I already know that , and a prayer is a prayer , is n't it ? " Nellie refilled the holy-water bottle from the kitchen hydrant , and hurried home to replace it before her grandmother should awaken . Hannah spent the next hour lying flat on her stomach printing letters , appealing to Virginia from time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very superior speller . Mrs. Joseph was busy with callers when Virginia went home , and Hannah was left to her own devices . Suddenly she thought of one stone that had been left unturned : there was her friend Mr. Jackson to whom the Lawrences always appealed in time of stress . She knew the formula , she knew his number , for on the list by the Lawrences ' telephone , his name , like Abou-ben-Adhem 's , led all the rest . " Main 1234 , " it was as easy as counting . She slipped into the telephone closet and closed the door . There was no trouble with Hannah that night . She went to bed early , and did n't care to have any stories told -- she could go to sleep by herself . " Quite a change of heart , eh ? " Eli commented to Rose , as they sat by the living-room fire after telling their little girl good night . " She has been like that all day , playing as happily as you please , " Rose responded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in last night 's scene . " Eli drummed abstractedly on the arm of his chair : " I do n't feel quite right about it , even so , " he said . " Maybe you will think me inconsistent , " she confessed , flushing , " but Hannah was so indifferent about the presents sent her for Chanuca , I only showed her two . I 've saved the others to give her Christmas Day , so she will have something of her own to show when the other children bring theirs over . " Eli did n't seem any too pleased . " Poor little mite , " he murmured . * * * * * " His-st ! Missis Joseph ! " It was Bridget , the Hallorans ' old family servant , calling softly from the hall . " I 'll be after takin ' the prisints ye 've stored away for us . I 'll lave ' em on the back porch ' n ' carry ' em over when the childer are all asleep . Nellie 's in bed like a little angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do be a-snoopin ' into ivery crack ' n ' corner ! " Mrs. Joseph unlocked a closet under the stairs , and loaded Bridget 's arm 's with heavy and bulky parcels . " Shure , an ' ' t is a sad Chris'mus we 'll be havin ' , savin ' the childer . Mr. Timmy , him that 's old Missis Halloran 's youngest , but old enough to know better , he ups an ' runs away to-day an ' marries a Protestant gir-rl . An ' if ye 'll open y'r windy the bit av a crack , ye 'll hear the poor old lady this minit , wailin ' like a banshee . " " But Mr. Timothy is such a nice young man , he must have married a lovely girl , Bridget , " said Rose . " Shure , an ' that may be , but she is a Protestant , Missis Joseph . She runs away fr 'm her folks , an ' he runs away fr 'm his , an ' they get married by a justice o ' peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doin ' , Lord ' ve mercy on their souls ! " " Oh , poor Grandma Halloran ! " " Poor lovers , " said Eli , when Bridget had gone . " I 'll wager they had the very deuce of a time with both sides . " No sooner had they settled themselves again than the door knocker sounded . Eli admitted Mr. Jackson , the Christian Science practitioner . " I have only a minute , " he said . " I just dropped by to leave a doll my wife dressed for your little girl . We chose one that we thought looked like Hannah . " " Oh , but that is kind of you ! " Rose looked her gratitude . " Mrs. Lawrence has told me how busy both you and your wife always are -- and to take time to think of our little girl --  --  ! " " I had intended to give it to her myself , " Mr. Jackson continued , " but after her talk with me to-day I decided she would enjoy it more if I asked Santa Claus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She called me up by telephone and asked me to give Santa Claus a treatment -- she seemed to think that he would pass her by . I could assure her that he would n't , as I had already seen the doll . Hannah is a wonderful child . " " We think so , " smiled Eli . " I am sure we thank you , and wish you the very merriest Christmas . " " It will be a happy Christmas for me , " he answered . " I am going to the station to meet my father and mother . Some years ago they felt estranged from me -- they are both staunch Presbyterians of the old school and it nearly broke their hearts when I went into Christian Science work . But they are beginning to look more tolerantly upon my calling , and they are on their way now to spend Christmas with us . You can guess how happy that makes me . ' Peace on earth , good will to men ' it is a wonder-working thought . " " It is indeed , " Eli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor , Rose and Eli stood staring at each other rather foolishly . She was the first to speak : " Is there no end to the fight between the old and the new generation ? " " We are just beginning the scrap with our new generation , " he said . " She called him up and asked for Christian Science help ! I wonder what else that little monkey has been up to ? " They soon found out . Carrying the doll Mr. Jackson had brought , Rose tiptoed after Eli into the nursery and gradually turned on the light . The first object to meet their eyes was Hannah 's stocking , hanging precariously to a pin driven into the mantel . Pinned to the wall were several messages , neatly printed in pencil , which told their own tale : Deer Santy -- Nellie babtized me . Holy wotter . Hannah . Deer Santy -- I want things in my stockin . Hannah . Deer Santy Claws -- Ime a jentile . Nellie babtize me . Ime a jentile cath-lic C. S. Hannah . Deer Santy -- Bring me any nice things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let my Mama and my Papa get mad bout you . Hannah . Eli began to chortle , and Hannah stirred in her sleep , throwing both chubby arms over her head . Clutched tightly in her left hand they saw a rosary of amethyst colored beads . Rose snapped off the light and pushed Eli out into the hall . He sat down on the stairs and laughed until he cried . " The dog-gone little mixer ! " he chuckled . " A Gentile Catholic Christian Scientist is she ? And if she has ever happened to hear anything about Mahomet , believe me , she 's sleeping with her feet toward Mecca right now ! " Rose was weeping silently over the message : " Do n't let my Mama my Papa get mad bout you . " She touched her husband on the shoulder , " Eli , what shall we do about it ? " " Do ? " He stood up and set his jaw determinedly . " You spoke just now of the fight between the old and the new generations : do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concede our child her legitimate rights . She will seek them out , and take them by force , and never forgive us for withholding them , that 's what ! Every child who has ever heard of Santa Claus has a right to enjoy the myth .

" Eli , where are you going ? " " Down-town to see Santa Claus if I have to break open a dozen stores , " he answered determinedly . * * * * * It seemed that Santa Claus , never having visited Hannah before , had a mind to make up for lost time . An overflowing stocking hung from the mantel ; a tree loaded with presents and tinsel stood by her bed ; about the room were placed large gifts , everything a little girl might wish for . Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father standing in the doorway of the nursery , their arms about each other , and smiling . She tugged at her window until it opened and then called to Nellie across the intervening space . " He came ! He came ! " she screamed , as a tousled , flame-colored head showed at the window opposite . Hannah brushed by her parents and , running to the window nearest Virginia 's room , repeated her message . Then she came back into the nursery , still oblivious of mother and father , and stared about her in ecstasy . The occasion called for some expression of thanksgiving -- what could it be ? A seven-year-old child has n't words for such a big emotion . She could think of but one thing to do . Reverently bowing her little bronze head , she made the sign of the cross -- upside down ! THE END
