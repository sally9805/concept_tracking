fa the 291antle for April 1 027 we left Hilda Bose , with her seventy-year-old husband and her nine-year-old son , camping out in a tent. , in latitude 50 ? north , on the Peace River , somewhere between Fort . Vermilion and the Great Slave Lake . The new letters , from which we have made it select ion , describe her journey into that northern wilderness , and the vicissitudes which have beset , her since she began to prove up her claim to the new homestead . ? Tar : Enrrous FORT VERMILION , ALBEItTA Jay 10 , 1910 DEAR Docron-LA ov : am now on the steamer going north and will land very soon , so this will be a short letter so I can get it remly and leave it here on the steamer to take back to civilization . We will land at I , . Point , which is ten miles before we Collie to the trailing post . There is only one white settler there and he is on the boat . Ile has fifteen children ? is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a missionary and the first white man here . Ile has taken a grott fancy to Daddy , and as he is a very rich man his word is law on the river . The boat was crowded and we had no berths and night . was cooling on . Ile called the purser and told him to give us a good stateroom and look after Mr. Rose , as he looked Jired and needed rest . Say , I never saw a man jump around so tiWiftly . The best stateroom was given to us and we had every attention as if we were rich . Daddy was eight days in the freight car and was in a dreadful slate when he arrived . I took him to a hotel and gave a woman a dollar to carry toe four ! tails of water from the creek and heat two cans of it , and then I bathed the poor dear and put him to bed . Ile could n't even eat . for exhaustion . Ile was just . a helpless baby . I 'm so glad Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all right and I 've quit worrying . Boy is the only child on the boat and is very happy . - Everybody wants him , and from the captain , who coaxes him up into his tower and lets him use his telescopes , to the engineer and deck hands , he surely has a good time . Leaving Edmonton , the freight that Daddy was on lost twelve cars just behind him . They turned turtle and piled up on the track no that my train was delayed eleven hours . Finally we got going again and we had a wreck , but our car was left standing on the track . This was in a swamp and we were there six hours at night , and the mosquitoes descended on us and Boy almost . lost his mind , though I wrapped his legs in my jacket and fanned him constantly . Finally they rustled up an old locomotive and a freight car and took us to Peace River Town . It was very crowded and the first-class ! xissengers were horrified when they had to ride with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , just as tight as could be . No lights , and they sang songs as we rode along , for most of us were happy to be going again through the dark hills to safety . have no time to write more . The land looks green , lovely , and lonesome . I am a little homesick . Just a tearful feeling . . July 25 , 1920 The boat came up this morning and brought me your letter , and this is just a hasty scrawl that I hope will catch the boat if someone here at the L. ranch goes down to the shore . I love it here , but see hardships ahead . Getting ready for winter will be a big job . Daddy is poorly . I kept him in bed all day yesterday and he felt stronger to-day , but not able to do anything . But God will see me through and I am happier than I 've been for several years . It grows here -- everything grows , though the season is so short one must hustle to get it planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it takes work to get it ready for winter . There is plenty of water in the majestic river if wells fail . Happy , dear heart ! I have reached the garden of Eden . But , there is the winter and the cold , the hard work , the loneliness . I 'll get my mail once a month , I think , for some breed or somebody will come by surely . I repeat the Twenty-third Psalm each day . No doe ) The talk now is only ' fur ' and dogs . ' In another month there wo n't be a breed or Indian within one hue . Bredand fifty miles , nor anybody , as all will be on the trap lines and we wo n't see a soul till spring . Yet , I do n't dread it . Yesterday a large wolf ? and they are immense ? came wit h-in three hundred yards of our tent . From the ground to the top of the middle of their back is thirty-six inches , Take a yardstick and measure the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Some are black and some arc gray and some are mixed . The bounty is eight dollars and the best skins bring twenty-five dollars , You know we are on a bend of the river . The wolves have a trail right across the neck at our back , so we inn see them as they streak across . I have six wolf traps and I shall set them out as soon as my bait is rotten enough . It takes an awful stink to lure them to your traps , unless you have a dead horse or something to set your traps around . The largest wolves stand as high as forty inches to the back up here . I have n't got a decent rifle for them . Nothing but old muzzle loaders that Daddy 's forefather used in the Revolutionary War and a good little V rifle . If I can get them once into a trap I 'll kill them with a club and ' shabbynacky ' myself a good 30.30 rifle . Shabby-mucky ' means ' trade ' in here . The only white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were two priests to take the place of two old priests going out . ' One at the Catholic Mission and one at the English Church Mission . So we are very well known by hundreds of breeds and savages , as they have THE NEW HOMESTEAD what I call ' moccasin telegraph ' service here . It travels very fast by moccasin and canoe . If someone gets a new dog we all know it and all about it very quickly . Our dog is known to hundreds that have never seen it . To save my candles I am writing this by the stove . By taking off one lid 1 get a fitful light that barely enables me to see to write . It makes me think of Lincoln 's early life . We are still living in a tent , but it 's getting pretty cold nights . It was twenty degrees above zero in the tent last night and I wo n't be able to get a log cabin this year , as good logs are too far away . So we are going to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cover the tent and put a roof on it of poles and put hay and dirt on it . This pioneering is tough , all right , but I expected it and a merry heart goes a long way . Though not a clay passes that I do n't question myself whether I have done right in coming so far away . But no one could help me where I was , and I wanted to keep my self-respect and raise the boy to he a real man , and I did n't have a show there . Boy has a very small Indian pony ? looks like a small Shetland pony , but has the toughness and pep so necessary down here . Our rivers flow down to the Arctic here . When Daddy came lie stopped at the last drug store in civilization to get a box of salve . The kindly little gray-haired lady who waited on him asked him , Whither bound ? ' and he said , ' Fort Vermilion . ' That 's my grave , ' said she sadly . Why , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I wintahed one yeah on the Great Slave Lake . ' Did n't you like it ? ' asked Daddy . ' No , ' says she . Too fah from a doctah . " Well , ' said Daddy , ' she 's quite close to a " doctali " now , for her husband is one and runs that little drug store . ' When Boy comes riding on his pony back over the hills , now you see him , then he 's out of sight in a gully , now lie 's riding up the slope , gone again , and then comes racing home on a gallop . Well , it 's like looking at a Wild-West movie show , only it 's real . Ile and his poi are one ? all the brother he has ex n his big black shepherd clog . I mus ? get some dogs , but not this year . Only dogs are used here in winter . You lie clown on your sled wrapped in a feather quilt and the river is the road . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have too much on my hands yet awhile . A bunch of will pups would drive me crazy . A husky is half wolf ; a malamute is a husky bred back to a wolf . They make fine sled clogs , but have to be well fed or they 'll turn on you and eat you up . I have too many to feed now , but I 'll have a bunch of trained clogs after a while . One of the breeds says he 'll take Boy out on the trap line when he gets big enough . The trap line is from one to five hundred miles off and lies over a big country where only Indians live , well watered with unknown rivers and lakes . Each trapper chooses his line , which runs through the bush along these rivers , creeks , and lakes , and he builds a cabin at the end of each day when he goes over it the first time . Six cabins is the rule . So it takes a week to go over his route , and he travels thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring he comes out to the trading posts with his catch and trades it for what he needs or sees at the post ; wastes his substance on whiskey , cards , and foolishness ; goes in debt to the post for a grubstake for the next winter , and then there is the hardship and loneliness of the trap line ahead of him again . All the talk now is ' dogs ' and ' fur . ' Saw some fur last night , ' says Peter R. , a half-breed . ' What was it ? ' I asked . ' A big wolf , and if my horse had n't got scared I 'd ' a ' shot him , ' he answered . The foxes are shy and you never see them . A large bear looted Jack W. 's cabin . Just , tore things loose and carried off his bacon . A wolf carried off a fresh beef hide from the white settler 's place two weeks ago . That 's all the news . I have no paper from the U. S. and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interesting ? I hope you are saving them . Politics and world happenings , you know . August 24 , 1920 Have n't a minute to spare , as winter is n't far off , but must write you a few lines , as I know you 'll be anxious about us up here in this vast wilderness . I am still living in a tent and cooking over a camp fire , and it appears to be very healthy , judging by how dirty we get to be . I smell like a smoked herring . No well dug yet , so we get water from the river , and very good water it is . A large bear is prowling around , but not having shells for bears I ca n't tackle it yet . I have fifty-six traps of all kinds , which is just one twentieth of what the other trappers have , but I will get more if I catch any fur . The trading post trades you anything you want for fur , charging about four times what it 's worth , plus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose I take some eggs or butter to the store . They 'll offer me , say , fifty cents a pound or dozen . ' Shabby-may , ' or else I can take it home . There is no cash business done at all . But it 's not so worse , ' as one man said . The trader will buy you anything from the ' outside ' you want , from a box of salve to a threshing machine , providing you have it coming . Furs dropped in price fifty per cent here when the U. S. put a fifty per cent tariff on raw furs . So the poor Indian gets it in the neck . ' The trader plays safe . I went horseback over to see a family living seven miles from U.S and learned quite a bit about setting the traps . The breeds are really beginning to like us . One smiled at us and joked me about being a barber when he passed by to-day and I was rimming Daddy 's hair out in the sunshine in front of the tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but once a friend , it 's forever true . Our homestead is in a bend of the river and has some low hills at the back , where it is thirty feet higher than the river . There is a small lake and a slough with muskrats in it , partly on our place , and the lake on the homestead for Karl to locate on when he is eighteen years old . I expect to malty our living catching the rats and a few foxes . The fur is so scarce that the trappers go far inland and have trap lines a hundred miles long . But that leaves what there is here for me ; and foxes can run , so I 'll get some , I 'm sure , and rats always live in sloughs . We have been very busy putting up hay . Daddy ca n't work hard , but he got , a job from the white settler to ride the big mower for him for a few days , and in return his breeds stacked up what hay we 'll need for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nearly all cleaned good hay ground . There is plenty of hay around here , as the white settler has set fires for forty years and cleaned up for fifty miles around his place for his stock to graze on . You have caught the spirit of my venture . So have the breeds and Indians . They will love its soon . We are so original and natural . I received all your letters and we enjoy those editorials . More than before we need a window to see what the world is doing . I do dread the winter and we are cutting logs and poles , but it 's slow . I have warm blankets and quilts and a moose hide to make us moccasins and ten pounds of wool yarn to knit up , and I shall cut one blanket up for clothing and lining coats and vests . We 'll make it fine , Vegetables never fail here , nor grain or berries . By salting one spot against the prevailing wind , deer and moose can be got easily . There are big fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , and Ile only helps those that help themselves . My two good friends will never get over it , I fear . They are shocked to death . So frail , Daddy so old , boy so young . But that 's what makes it so interesting . Not to go to a poorhouse , nor crawl on my belly in an irrigated garden for a living . As I look at the river on three sides , where there will never be a sign of human habitation in sight , We were so tired of half rations , so sick of the struggle . I expect hardships , welcome them , but it will be on a full belly and I can stand it . September 0 , 10E6 My conscience is troubling me very much . I tried to doctor a sick soul and gave a sedative instead of using the surgical knife . The white settler has a dear little daughter , just twenty-two years old . I never thought I 'd find a woman smaller than I , but this girl is , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the woods . I mean , sweet . All the young girls are that way . Their eyes are shy and timid and I could n't hurt them . The white settler has so many kids , and the girls range in age from ten to twenty-three and there are seven unmarried and all are just as I have described them . M. is the one that haunts my wakeful hours at night . Which reminds me of a verse in the Bible , which says , if I remember right , ' The poor are always with us , ' For M. told me the first day I met her , The breeds are here , and we must accept them and treat them like human beings . ' Daddy said the sante and we are doing it . All breeds are not alike , but the big majority have strong backs and weak heads . Among the exceptions is one named N. That 's his first name . Ile is nearly white , tall , very strong , and would pass for a Frenchman outside . ' But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellows looks like one . He has always worked at the ranch and played with the children as he grew up , and fell in love with M. Her parents have forbidden her to ever think of marriage with a breed . M. has refused eight white trappers , to share their cabins , and I do n't blame her . I have n't seen one yet as nice as N. Yes , he wipes the dishes for her every day and they look anywhere except at each other when anyone is looking , but when they 're alone blue eyes look at soft black eyes . He eats with the breeds at their table and this little act of wiping the dishes is his one happy moment after each meal . Dear Doctor-Lady , I wish you could see them together . So happy and yet so unhappy . Then one day M. broke down and cried and told me . And I comforted her , assuring her everything would come out all right and that N. was a very good man . I could n't bear to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she marries N. My sympathy made me do wrong . For I do n't want breed grandchildren myself . I ca n't think of anything more horrible than to have grandchildren with strong backs and weak heads . For breeds are just big children . If I had expressed nay horror at such a union as she contemplates , my conscience would be clear and I 'd feel like a brute . What . shall 1 do ? Just let , nature take its course ? Am I , it woman from the ' outside ' and well informed , responsible for this ? She said she was going to marry him or die an old maid . It 's too bad that we are fifteen miles from the white settler . Karl gets so lonesome for children . 1 play with hint some , but it 's not the same . He knows the name of every breed around here and quite a few Indians . lie has also made at friend of the Mounted Police , who is nicknamed ' Biddy ' and is a rather young-looking man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped Out of a storybook . But they lead a very strenuous life here , protecting the white settler and keeping the Indians peaceful . There is only one at each fort and their days are full of danger , and braver men never lived . - Biddy has told Karl many stories of his own exploits and of another who was his partner a few years back , but got . shot by a murderer who was quicker on the trigger than he was that time . So among uneducated , silent Indians , childlike breeds , and trappers of the fur , Boy 's life will be spent . But already 1 see a change in him . lie is more manly , more to be depended out He realizes that we are in a new , will country and that . I depend on hint make a home here and provide the necessities of life . The silence almost gets inc . For two weeks I have n't seen a white person , and we , Boy and I , have been alone . Daddy had to app war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our homestead and he left , us en the twenty-seventh of August . Ile will most . likely be back the end of this week . Boy and I have been so lonely without hint . But the law has to lie complied with , and by homesteading himself , if he should die before Boy is of age , I also get a homestead , besides the right to prove tip his homestead should he die before it is proved up or after . He is very anxious for Boy to get a good farm and enough to pasture stock on . It 's possible to get . half tt section , besides Boy 's homestead , right at eighteen years of age this way . I think that Daddy will be with us a good many years yet , but , he does n't I kink so , though 1 tell him that ' creaking hinges last a long time . ' You ca n't get a breed or an Indian In live alone . They are the most childish and superstitious mortals I 've ever heard of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of ? ' 1 ask them . ' I do n't know ' is all the answer I get , or ' 1 wo n't stay alone ? I ca n't . ' My health is better here and Karl is growing so fast I can just see him grow , and he is just as chubby . So the climate so far agrees with us . I hope you are well , too , and happy . October 25 , 1 926 This will be just a few lines to let you know that 1 ' in well and we 're all feeling good . Winter is here , snow on the ground , and we are still in a tent , but building on our cabin . It 's not . very cold , except in spells , and I have a heater up besides the old cookstovc . There is 110 soul closer than seven miles  --  not even an Indian . All are away on their trap We had fish for supper last night and prairie chicken for dinner . Just as a battle looks more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fray , so this must look that way to von . It 's pioneering , say , but I think we 'll winter through all right . I do wish we had a house and barn , but will dig away at , it and by next winter we 'll have it . I have a roof over the kitchen stove and three walls to that , hut have to cut lots of logs yet for the rest . Old winter will be a snorter in another month and I must go to work again . Ca n't wait a minute . Thank you for the paper . The mail is a bright spot in our life , a window to look out on the big outside . ' The river is Mt . running ice yet , but will any day , and then the mail will be once a month and I. may not be able to get it regular , as it 's over thirty miles away and I have no dog team . I saw a clog tean this week . A trapper passed through with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kissed each of his dogs on the forehead and hugged them and cried a little over them . He vowed he 'd never whipped them and I told him right to his face he was a liar . Such beautiful clogs , and their hearts were broken ; their tails turned down and slicked tight to their stomachs at the sound of his voice . This country is ' hell ' for clogs and Indians . The Indians are in the grip of the fur traders and are robbed terribly , and just starve along , always in debt to the traders . And the traders just hate white settlers and manage have most of them gone out again , but I intend to stick . if I get through this winter I 'll make it . It 's a wonderful country , a bracing climate , and I love it . The fairy-tale book and Robinson ernsue , have been a godsend for Boy . just what . he needled for his mind . He has his sled and a hill to slide on , a clog to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the big axe . Much better than I am . Well , it 's going to be a hard time for me for a while , but I 'm game . So much is at stake . January Is , Inv Just think , T ' ve been to a party . A real party , and it seems just too good to be true ; and a year from now there 'll be allot her one . But first . 1 must . tell you about the Preacher , because he enters so much into our lives . The English Church sends us one missionary and we call hint the Preacher . ' The old one was pensioned and sent to England the week we arrived here . He thought , he could ride his circuit as usual and the result was he was found wandering in a muskeg , by the Indians . Ile had started out with a sandwich in his pocket and no mosquito bar , and when found was out of his head . It 's no trouble to get lost here at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home without the dog . When I mutt to go home I tell him to go ahead and show me the way . Our new Preacher is just out of college . He 's a dandy ? real good-looking , young , jolly . Can sing a rollicking college song or dance a jig . He is very modern , immaculately dressed , and rides like all Englishmen ? bumpety-bump . It looks so unnatural . We enjoy his visits very much and he has called four times already . There are so few hero that . it does n't take long to get around . No , the teacher got cold feet at the last minute and would n't come . She was 0 strong , husky Scotch woman , and if she 'd come we 'd have got along fine and got our cabins built . Yes , I read your proposition of the irrigated land ; I know all about truck , fruit , and THE NEW HOMESTEAD apples and the marketing of it , too . It sounds nice , but when you ca n't sell what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high that the selling price of 1 he stuff wo n't cover it . There are no markets in the West . Some day I 'll tell you of five years spent on an irrigated ranch . I 'm grateful for the offer , but never again will I crawl on my belly for nothing . February 9 , 1027 There are just 131 civilized in here . By ' civilized ' I mean speaking English and wearing clothes . Of these , thirty-one are white , and I can count the white women on my fingers . The Preacher is a mine of information and our newspaper . He likes us and is delighted to think we are really settling here . We sometimes talk about the Bonny Lassie ' left in England and the aged mother who wo n't sell her antique and cherished old furniture and silver because she 's keeping it to move right into the ' Vicarage ' when he becomes the Vicar ' of the little village church . He loves the freedom here and says he ca n't , go back to the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning on coming here this summer . Wo n't that be fine ? Pretty rough on this gentle English girl to live amongst Indians and trappers , but I know site and I will be the best of friends and she 's a brick if she comes . It 's a self-imposed exile for me and will be for her , too . Love for your mate makes you daring , but it has its compensations . February II , 1027 These civilized people are scattered over a couple of thousand square miles . Many live in teepees and the rest in log cabins , except two or three who have board cabins . Mr. L. 's house was built by his father forty years ago of boards sawed with a handsaw . Some labor . He gives a party once a year after Xmas . The Preacher was so afraid we would n't go that he came after us . It 's hard to find the trail in the Snow and it 's a perfect maze to me , but we arrived at 7 P.M , and after a hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of music , recitations , songs , and dances . They have a big schoolhouse in the back yard and the eldest ( laughter teaches them . After the programme the dining room and big kitchen were cleared for ( lancing . Everybody was there except five and the Catholic Mission . The white women were elderly ? wives who had followed their husbands in here . Old-fashioned , unbobbed , and with long skirts . But it was like coining home , so warm was the welcome I received from this lonesome sisterhood . They held my hands so long ; they ( lid n't want to let them go . They were nearly all from the States , One had gone insane ? not . very bad ; you could see her mind was shattered , You know it takes some mental calibre to come in here and live alone and not see a white woman more than once or twice a year . If you have n't much in your head the lonesomeness will get . you . This woman is poor white trash from the cotton fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned her about her life here in order to learn what I could of the loneliness that makes insanity among sheep herders and farm women . I see by one of your letters that you have no conception of how far north I am . Calgary is a large city crowded with cars . Farther north is Edmonton , also a big city . Next comes Peace River , a small town at the end of the railroad . It has some autos and two wooden hotels . Each hotel has a bathroom in it , but you have to carry your water up from the creek and heat it on the kitchen range if you want to take a bath . Then I went on a steamer that holds thirty carloads of freight in the bottom . We went north all the way until we calm to the Great Slave Lake Region . We got off just this side of it in the wilderness . There are no autos in here . There are nine white people at Fort Vermilion , the Governor , doctor , Mounted Police , Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find the Great Slave Lake . A little south of it ? that 's here . Boy has already had two invitations from Indians to go trapping with them there when he gets a bit older . The Calgary , Edmonton , and Peace River Town districts are settled with farms till it looks like a checkerboard . Here is the primeval wilderness . Unless have the clog with me I never dare go out of sight of the house , as I get lost so easily . The white settler 's wife and children have to climb a tree quite frequently when picking berries to see in what direction to go home . As there are no roads in the sea , so there are none here . February A , 1927 I have now been in bed one week . Last night was a good night and I feel rested and easy to-day . Just a week ago I fell , striking my back on a small bag of frozen salt in the tent . I walked back to my little house , undressed , and crept into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be two weeks yet before I can walk . I found the hurt place in the Anatomy . The hurt is on the right side . I lie on my left side . To-day Daddy raised me up in a reclining position which feels very nice . Boy is the cook , and by following my directions does real well and bakes good bread . Sets his sponge at night just like any good housekeeper . There does n't seem to be anything out of joint and we 're so far from a doctor that at a dollar a milethe price is prohibitive unless something is really broken . The Indians are doctored free , but not white people . Doctors should be free to all people . I ' II never have another ( lector 's bill hanging over me if I can get well without . So tired I wo n't write any more now . March 1 , 1927 Still in bed , but better . Next week I 'll be up again . It was a slight sprain and much bruised . Daddy is baking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed with acute bronchitis . Running out while warm into the cold without a coat must have caused it , but Daddy is bringing him around in good shape . He smokes him every day for the cough . Pours oil of pine tar on hot coals and makes him breathe the smoke . It loosens the cough up fine . The Party . The Preacher said , ' Now you 'll see some fancy clothes . ' What ! Do they wear fancy clothes ? ' said I. The Duskies do , ' says he . As I had only met one Indian squaw all summer , I looked forward to seeing the others . I received the surprise of my life . He calls the Indian and breed women the Duskies . ' They were dressed in the latest fashion . Knee-length gowns , bobbed hair , flesh-colored silk stockings with bright flowers embroidered on the knees . Their gowns were of bright sills , and they were so painted and powdered the men looked black in comparison . Dancing the breakdown they grew so excited that Cree and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror . I thought they 'd start scalping next , but a glance across the room at the gleaming pistols and full cartridge belt of the Mounted Police reassured me . Nearly all had come in dog sleds . My little house . I love it . There is only one room in it , but I would n't trade it for a mansion . I could n't make a dugout in the hill , so then I started a log cabin . Eight logs were laid when the cold came . Such a cold ! The thermometer dropped steadily and we all cut wood to keep from freezing to death in the tent . We put up the big heater , but had to wear our coats to keep the cold from our backs . We lived from day to day . Building was out of the question . The intense cold just made the meat 00 our bones vanish away , and we ate all the time , all we could . Thanksgiving Day came , and just at dusk Mr. L. do ve up with four teams and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They brought everything with them and , with the thermometer at forty below zero , put up my little house in six days and had us moved in . I fed them . They could just get . in around the stove , but they were a jolly crew . They made big fires outside to get warm by . The icicles hung from their eyelashes in the intense cold , and they danced war dances around the fires and whooped to get warm . Mr. L. has a small saw outfit and saws lumber , and he brought odds and ends he had on hand . The ! Olindation was logs and they even dug me a small cellar . I shall pay for the material and time , of course . But . it was queer how they arrived just in the nick of time . Daddy was in bed for a week in the little house just from the cold . Nothing the matter with him at all . The cold grew worse until it was forty-nine below by my thermometer and sixty below by self-registering ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last !

March 11 , UN7 I was afraid you might worry about me , so I 'll write a few lines to tell you that the young doctor was out to see me and he examined my back and said it would be all right , but that one kidney was still sore . He left me a heap of pills of many colors which I wo n't take . The Government furnishes us a doctor and this lad is a dear child just out of college . He is very busy and has a hard row to hoe up here doctoring Indians . I did n't send for him , for 1 ca n't afford such luxuries . He came anyway . I guess the breeds must have told him I 'd never walk again . I ca n't walk much yet , but I take a few steps every day now . We had a nice visit and he told me all about college days . It was real nice of him to come sixty miles with a cold north wind blowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred and fifty miles when it was colder . Some life . April 25 , 1027 I am up and around ? not so very strong . Four inches of snow fell last night and it 's still snowing , but it will , 0 as soon as the wind changes . As soon as the ice goes out the mail will mme in .1 hope it goes soon . 1 ant planning a vegetable garden and am . in : ; to farm all I can . The summer is short , but it ' s almost continuous daylight and things do grow . I feel Isome to-day and wish there were msle other woman to talk to besides the one in the looldng-glass . I 'm not wall enough to be outside and I 'm tired of the inside . The mail will be so welcome . PEACE Ilnqat , ALBERTA May 4 , 1927 We 're expecting the boat this week with mail .

INly back is nearly well . I only feel it , when I stoop over . I 'm late with my garden and so busy . Ilad a heap of letters . Books and papers all arrived . The B. cape kept . Daddy 's head from freezing all winter . Ile even took it to bed with him . We have a fresh cow this month and lots of milk . hoar Vpacandox , ALBERTA May 21 , 1027 Spring is here at last and the grass is green . Flowers are springing up everywhere and wild strawberries are in bloom . There was quite a severe font a couple of nights ago that may have injured them . The mosquitoes are also with us now . If this land ever gets settled up they wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We sleep under a mosquito bar , at night , made of cheesecloth so the little ones ca n't crawl through . They will stay with us now until fall comes with sharp frost . lIut they are bearable . Sit seems to come as if by magic . There really is hardly any spring . To-day is Sim-day , I believe . I am never sure of the clays in the calendar . 1 studied the Bible a bit and found that . the word ' hell ' means ' the grave ' in many places in the Bible . 1 have heard people call this north country by both these names , but I need never do that . now that . people outside know I 'm here . 1 feel as if I have known all you folks all along , but you did n't lutow about me . The weeks and months and years slip by and the old struggle for existence goes on . It 's been a light to keep the intellect alive . Do you think 1 . ' 11 ever be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little time every day to study even when 1 am busy with the garden , and during the long winter there is too much time on my hands . The dark comes too quickly and then stays so long . What a lovely place I have for a home ! The river forms a perfect half circle around us , and there is a hill behind us that . shuts out . the north wind . The homestead is flooded below the hill until June . II . makes fine hay . On one side is a small lake that never goes dry . About eighty acres large . We are all alone . I was counting on catching fur , and there is n't any and wo n't be for three years ? if 1 can exist till then . I must write , for , while 1 hope to grmv most of what we cat , we need to Imy some things and freights are so high in here . I find that I am treated with great respect by the men in here . That 's because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilderness and stay with him . They look tough , but inside they 're homesick for sonic old mother , and always , of course , with the longing for a woman 's sympathy and love , which is the gnawing hunger of lonely men . The trappers are coming out of the bush on their way to the trading posts or to the ' out side . " fheir sleeping bags are filled with duck feathers and quilted . It 's really just a large comforter ; and they roll up in them and sleep right in the snow even when its sixty to seventy below Zero , I have gone back to when the world is still young . Civilization is gone and only the little band of lonesome women here remember it . I have a pretty little buckskin Indian pony , but . have n't dared to ride yet , as my ! sick is still a little lame . But . it is passing away and I ant getting stronger every day . May 31 , 1927 Boy and I went . Jointing yesterday together for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each time he shot getting his bird . The fifth time he shot he killed his duck , but she floated out of reach and the water was too deep for him to wade in after her . He ca n't swim yet very well , and I ca n't either . Of those he brought home , two were big mallards , one was an Indian 44 , and the other was a spoonbill . It ' s all the meat we have and it 's very goad . Ile is really getting to be a very good shot , Meat is very scarce here some years and has been so for quite a few years now , the Indians say . It ' s too far north and the country is so large , and wolves keep it down , too . But ducks are good as long as they last , After a while there will be prairie chickens . There are small deer here , but they are very scarce . I have never seen one . In the muskegs there are moose , but except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed on - them . It 's such a big , wild country ? big lakes , rivers , and mac . kegs ; no trails and no people . Less than two human beings to each thousand square miles , and that nicans Indians , too . I wo n't admit out . loud that I 'm lonesome , but it 's a Robinson Crusoe existence . Like being alive yet buried . Books will save my reason , and letters . Trappers tell me no white woman from the outside can stand it longer than six years . I 'll have to show them .
