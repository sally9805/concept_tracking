Two or more stray cats are caught , tied together by their extremities , hung over a convenient limb , and left to claw out each others ' eyes and innards . Meanwhile the passing mandarin smiles and coolies stop to widen yellow grins . Thus loom the ingrained traits which made it possible , last week , for certain Chinese irregulars of heathen persuasion to massacre with fiendish cruelty the Roman Catholic natives who once populated Leiyang in Hunan Province . <P> Details were meagre and the murderous heathen were soon labeled by lazy correspondents with the rubber stamp " COMMUNISTS .
