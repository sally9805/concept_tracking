" Old Gimlet Eye , " the " Fighting Hell-Devil Marine , " returned as Brigadier General last week to Tientsin , a city which he left just 27 years ago this month as a young Leatherneck Lieutenant , eager to do hand-to-hand battle with the slant-eyed " Boxers " who then held the Occidental quarter at Peking under murderous siege . <P> It was to prevent a recurrence of these battles of his youth that Brigadier General Smedley Darlington Butler ( see front cover ) reached Tientsin , last week , commanding 1,800 U. S. marines previously stationed at Shanghai . He knew that the Southern Nationalist Chinese armies were steadily advancing on Peking ( TIME , March 28 et seq. ) ; but whether " Boxer " - trouble was brewing again he could not be certain . From Washington , President Calvin Coolidge ordered last week that no chances be taken , that the U. S. Legation and all U. S. citizens be removed to the port of Tientsin from inland Peking , should that city be seriously menaced . To keep the way of escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were the tasks faced last week by " Old Gimlet Eye Butler . " <P> His presence at Tientsin gave confidence to U. S. citizens in Peking . They still feared , to be sure , that the Peking War Lord , Chang Tso-lin , might withdraw before the Southern armies , , retire to his war base at Mukden , and abandon Peking to its conquerors ; but with General Butler at hand , together with British , Japanese and French marine detachments , the safety of Occidentals in Peking seemed secure . <P> Why has U. S. President Coolidge sent Smedley Darlington Butler to this key post of high responsibility ? General Butler is a name which called up very recently no more than his comic tribulations as " Dry Tsar " of Philadelphia ( TIME , Jan. 4 , 1926 ) . When the President would not extend his leave to go on with that job , General Butler resigned from the Marine Corps , only to lose immediately his post as " Dry Tsar . " Nothing but the complacency of the Navy Department enabled General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps . Yet now it is General Butler who commands all U. S. marines in China . Why ? <P> Almost certainly the explanation is that President Coolidge is familiar with the career of General Butler-the career of a fighter who takes trouble by the whiskers . This General Butler literally did when , with only 180 Marines , he was besieged some years ago in a little Nicaraguan town , by a native general with over 2,000 troops . Smedley D. Butler , then a major , went out to parley with the besieging Commander , walked menacingly up to him , seized his long mustachios , poked a pistol into his midriff , and then twisted the Nicaraguan 's whiskers until he howled out orders to raise the siege and let Major Butler and his marines go . . . .
