The 50th anniversary of the Colonne Concerts is being celebrated in Paris . The founding of these concerts by Edouard Colonne marked a new epoch in musical appreciation in France . To the general French public music had never meant anything more than opera . Symphonic music was unknown to them . In the first place they were afraid of it . Colonne , then relatively unknown even in musical circles , educated the general public of Paris not only to an appreciation of the work of the old masters , but he also introduced to them the work of the young Frenchmen of their own time . The orchestra is at present being led by M. Gabriel Pierne.
