txt The railroad bill in its operation will most emphatically demonstrate the interdependence of state and individual prosperity both ? with transportation and industrial credit It is the individual man , with individual initiative and force , that , in a free country , blazes the way of progress . The inertia , the ignorance and the political prejudices may assail him , quench his enterprise and patriotism and halt his progressive work . In a few years , the free country sees that the principle was right . The work is then popularized and progress is resumed . This is as it should be , because the essential thing is man 's progress and not the material progress of a nation . HARRIMAN IN ADVANCE OF THE TIMES Had Mr. Harriman been allowed to carry vut program of railroad consolidation , we should have had better and more prosperous transportation , higher railroad credit , and greater efficiency in railroad operation and administration . But the education of the citizen and the voter , as respects the uses of credit in transportation and the vital part which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been neglected . Progress must often be halted that the people may be brought forward . While every man of affairs sets possibilities of the greatest world business development from the present situation , the progress of , the world must be halted and a ' world starvation must be faced , until there is education of men and nations as to the meaning of the word credit ? as to the relation and interdependence of capital and labor . OPENING NEW ERAS Columbus , seeking a new route to India , opened vp a continent  --  the last resting place of man in his progress around the world . From this continent must go forth a Declaration and Constitution not only for human freedom , but for the rights of man as respect government , education , and national and individual progress in freedom . The business world had no doubt that the five years following the world war would be five years of business reconstruction and upbuilding , expanding trade , new eras in shipping , and the conquest of man over the ... Lir and the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the world ' is ' crying out for gold as a. monetary base for trade expansion , the output is likely to be cut in half . Silver is still produced as a by-product in copper and lead mining and there is no capital ' or courage for new silver mining , although it stands at a minting premium over gold for the first time in 50 years . . .4 The copper output is still restricted and no man can tell why . The southern negro is lord of creation upsetting the exchanges of the world by his revelry in silk shirts and silk pajamas while over the South goes out the word : " Plant less and get more , thatle the only route to Cotton ' at 50c per pound . " . The coal miner re-echoes the . southern sentiment , and ai double the wages for mining coal : therc'is 20% less coal , while the miner goes a-fishing. 310TORS A1D WEEDS ? ? The farmer revels in moving pictures and motor cars based on double prices for wheat and corn and then finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the motor cars while his farm grows up to weeds and he can raise only enough produce for his own existence . The farms of Michigan are going to weeds while the farmhands are turning out 700 Chevrolet motors a day and 500 Hoicks a day in Flint , , and Detroit is bounding forward to a million population . Look down the line'and you see ' Studebaker building another . $15,000,000 plant and preparing to bid for therabor to run it Newspapers , fattened with fictitous advertising from tax-dodgers , arc willing to pay any price for paper , but neither the forests nor the mills can supply the de'mand . THE BROTHERHOOD OF " IAN Surely the times are out of joint but the lessons are many ; and they all relate to the brotherhood of man . E. H. Harriman was brother to his fellow MAT/ when he wanted to unite the railroads of the United States that the strength of the strong trunklines might be poured into the weaker feeders , and the whole system stabilized , with improved credit and billions of new capital enlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Senator Sherman was no less a friend of his fellow man when he wrote the Sherman anti-trust law . But the politicians and the anti-capitalist agitators misdirected the-Sherman law in assault on the railroads . Now wisdom has returned to its own and Washington legalizes railroad consolidations to strengthen railroad credit and promote the public interest . A S E Count ' SERA ' ES THE PUBLIC There is something highly educational in the Supreme Court decision averting the destruction of the U. S. Steel Corporation . The decision . the law , the blind balances , the adjudication all hung by a thread and a minority of the court TC/16.2% ; a majority decision , two radical judges being disqualified ; The court notes that combinations to export Acel arc now allowed by law , and in effect it asks why in the public interest dissolve a combination that promotes exports and trade , serves the public , and is nowhere oppressive or monopolistic ? Had the Steel Corporation been dissolved every Steel shareholder would have had several pieces of paper instead of one . There would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and , in the aggregate , there would have been increased share profit and increased expense for which the publi. : have paid . It was to the interest of the public that the 40% unit in the steel trade should be maintained . Common sense . sound economies and the public interest prevailed . DECISIONS THAT MADE POOFITS There is something highly educational for all other courts , for Congress . the Executive . the politicians and the public not only in this decision but in the preceding Standard Oil and Tobacco decisions . Who has profited by the dissolution of the so-called Tobacco Trust ? Had the odious tobacco trust . remained with its contracts of monopoly it would have destroyed itself . The Standard Oil trust with one hundred million capital sold at 400% when dissolved . The Supreme Court smashed the thing into 33 parts and the stockholder now beholds the parent company worth twice its former price or eight hundred million and he holds in his left hand the other 32 parts worth five times the original whole ? r two billions dollars . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parent company minus : 32 of its parts is earning 50% more than the entire combination earned before dissolution . Moreover the Standard . Oil has no responsibility concerning the price of oil . It is fOrhidden by court to reduce the price . The Standard Oil companies are restricted in their territory and outside of it they may not go to compete with other Oil companies . TRANSFORMATION Behold the transformation as the result of education . The railroads arc combined more effectively and more broadly than would have been possible under a free rein for Mr. Harriman . The Government has thrown them together and decreed that the strong shall care for the weak ? exactly what Mr. Harriman proposed in the public interest . The destruction of the oil trust has freed man to produce , transport and refine in competition with the Standard Oil , and this is the essential thing . The increased price of oil is not the human essential and it is an incentive to a larger oil production now necessary in the man 's national progress ... A JUDGMENT ACCORDING TO 1101 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not having conspired or combined , except socially in human progress and brotherhood , not having monopolistic profits or tabor oppression is given a clean bill of health to pur ! . sue its honest way . Some in public office have attempted to decree that 40% of a trade is , a monopoly but the Supreme Court now ? by a narrow margin  --  says more than 40% may be a public blessing and the Supreme Court is right . Twenty per cent . of a trade in bad hands or . moved by bad motives may be a public curse .
