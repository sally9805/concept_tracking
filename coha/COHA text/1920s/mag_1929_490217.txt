WHAT about the young men who murdered a Pennsylvania witch , and are consigned to a life behind bars ? Pity the young men ! We are used to crimes of passion  --  sex jealousy , revenge , lust ; it startles us to learn that there are witches in Penn 's woods . To get a lock of hair and free their souls , the young men killed a farmer . Call them unlucky  --  and then remember the other witchcraft that we know more about : the thirteenth floor , the third match , the broken mirror , and the conjure-tricks of the Stratons and the Comstocks and the Wi/lebrandts who would unhex the nation by their simple charms and their rabbit 's foot of reform . Read the incantations of the political platform and the strange and beautiful magic of the liturgical hymn . Pity the young men ! SOMEHOW , the news that W. C. Durant will soon be making artificial silk instead of automobiles , fails to disquiet us . It rather tends to confirm our suspicion that all businesses are the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , finding familiar material at the bottom of every incoming basket . Mr. Durant 's withdrawal from the automotive field is hardly disturbing , because , although he has been a prominent figure in the industry , it has always been something of a trick to find one of his cars on the road . We suspect he never had a true feeling for automobiles  --  not in the way Henry Ford has . That is why Ford , not Durant , has captured the public 's fancy and stirred the country 's dust . Not even the Dearborn Independent , nor the peace ship , nor the early American furniture , ever really distracted Ford 's mind from the building of cars ; and while the name Durant has always meant Wall Street and speculation , the name Ford has always meant Detroit and production . No one can say just what the future holds , but we confidently await the appearance of the slogan , on billboards and in newspapers : " Just a real good bolt of artificial silk ! " NOT all of Mr. John S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressing books . Some of it is spent in writing for magazines . Shortly after Mr. Sumner , with the aid of two detectives , had confiscated about eight hundred copies of " The Well of Loneliness , " we happened to read an article in The American Sketch called " Myself As I Think Others See Me , " by John S. Sumner . In part , it said : " I find my pleasure in mixing with the preponderating ordinary and normal people , neither highbrow nor low-brow . . .. I love the sunshine , the moonlight , trees , green fields , and the restless ocean . Give me a pipe and a book . . . " We could read no further . Give him a hook and he takes eight hundred . ONLY a few days ago , we complained in these plaintive columns about the way a policeman had broken into our office and sold us a benefit ticket ; and now we see by the papers that that ugly practice has been stopped . It looks like another victory for our pen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our head . Take the story of the reforms which have originated in our editorial fastnesses , and you have the story of New York 's greatness . SINCE its widening , Park Avenue has become the fastest avenue in town , and usually is the best north-andsouth bet for the urgent motorist . It is common to do from twelve to sixteen blocks on a green light , and some of the madder taxi-drivers make eighteen . Also , a minor miracle of traffic sometimes takes place on this thoroughfare : occasionally one travelling south gets to the Grand Central Building just as the light goes red , thus escaping it altogether . In this mariner we recently were whisked all the way from Sixty-third Street to Thirtieth Street without a halt  --  a dreamlike experience that left us a little dizzy from such long-sustained motion . Citizen Smith GOVERNOR SMITH begins the day now by singing " Father O'Flynn " in his bath , a song which the family has n't heard since the presidential campaign started . He is light-hearted in spite of the fact that many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really intends to be idle , and on vacation , for some months . Carriers still stagger under his morning 's mail , which is heavy with suggestions on what to do . A group of Philadelphia promoters have been trying to interest him , along with the Messrs . Kenny and Raskob , in a great new hank which is being organized , but the Governor will not listen to them . He rises late , even though he usually retires early , and spends the first part of the day in his Madison Avenue offices  --  which , We are now told , really belong to his friend , William English , who lends them to the Governor . Every afternoon , almost without fail , he rides in his car down to Twenty-third Street and Fourth Avenue , where he meets his friends Kenny and James Riordan in the former 's famous Tiger Room . Mr. Smith sometimes fiddles away a little time on a horse-racing toy there . Afterwards , the three usually walk uptown to the Smith apartment at the Biltmore , and so far the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Smith spends his evenings quietly , having no taste for night life ? so far as anybody knows he has never been to a night club , and he likes to go to dinner only at houses where not too much fuss is made over him . Recently he has been entertained at Charles Dana Gibson 's , John F. Gilchrist 's , and the Riordan home . He rarely plays cards , but he likes to stand by and watch . He is known as something of a wit on these occasions . One night a week he goes to the home of Alfred , Jr. , where he enjoys his daughter-in-law 's sauerbraten and German potato pancakes , a favorite dish . He complains of missing his daily afternoon visits with Mary Adams Warner , his granddaughter , who is with her parents in Albany , and he also misses the animals he had in the zoo at Albany . His greatest loss just now is Bunk , a Boston terrier pup , a favorite around the executive mansion . Bunk was sent to one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up to the end of last week the Governor had gone to four shows , in this order : " Whoopee , " " Scandals , " " Three Cheers , " and " Street Scene , " the last because of his friendship with the producer , William Brady . He does n't accept free tickets , and generally the management does n't know he is coming until he arrives . Disposal N A TELL informed about the facts V V of life , but entirely ignorant of the rudiments of housework , a young lady went to spend a week in the country with her newly acquired and beloved husband . They occupied a Connecticut farm which a friend agreed to lend them for so hallowed an interlude . The plan worried no one except the mother of the bride , who suspected her daughter of gross ignorance in the matter of conking and dusting . At the end of the week , the pair returned to town , apparently still on speaking terms with each other . " Well , how did it go ? " the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the young lady . " I got along all right with everything except the garbage . There was no garbage man , and I did n't know what to do with it . " " Well , " said her mother , eyeing her sharply , " what did you do with it ? " " Tied it up and brought it back to town , " replied the proud child . Books at a Million WE attended the Jerome Kern auction the night when the total sales were approaching a million dollars . About two hundred people were present , among them most of the leading dealers of the country : Gabriel " %Veils , Harry Marks , Dr. Rosenbach , and so on . Outsiders do not readily understand the system of bidding at book auctions . Nobody jumps up and waves his arms , nobody shouts , " I 'll bid ten thousand dollarsl , " nobody , in fact , seems to be doing anything at all . The auctioneer nevertheless constantly intones in a smooth , somnolent voice , " Ten thousand I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soy it , eleven thousand I have , is there any advance , twelve thousand I have . " ( At book auctions " may " is used , not " can . " ) Near the auctioneer , in a squared-off recess in the wall , like a Punch-andJudy theatre , an attendant displays the volume being sold , a spotlight focussed upon it . People rustle their catalogues . Clerks , scattered among the crowd , stare mesmerically about and suddenly announce , " Thirteen thousand . " " Thirteen thousand , " the auctioneer echoes from his pulpit . Then abruptly it is all over . The attendant removes one book and exposes another . Bidding begins again Bidding is done not by word of mouth but by signs , and these arc- interpreted according to the previous hid . Thus if the Last raise has been one thousand dollars , you have only to lift your hand vertically and the price is snapped up another thousand . A horizontal gesture would have meant just half as much ; a quarter-circle , one-fourth the previous bid . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as a bidder thinks he has the field to himself a clerk , consulting a memorandum book , is likely to raise , and raise again . He is the Order Clerk , bid ding for the account of an absent client , somebody unavoidably detained in Indianapolis or Louisville . Again , there are cabalistic signs and passwords . The auctioneer is likely to conclude with " Sold to D'Artrignan " or some such romantic reference , which is an alias to mislead the uninitiated . " Dr. R. " for instance is well known as the pseudonym of Rosenbach . With such nods and wavings of the hand , the Kern sale went on . A copy of Goldsmith 's " Vida 's Sacchis , or Chess , " starting at ten thousand dollars as we prepared to go , had reached twenty-five thousand before we found our gloves . Only the experts know why some items . Sell for larger amounts than others . Rosenbach 's interest in a hook or manuscript , however , usually sends it pretty high before it is sold . Thus he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin , faded green volume written by Elizabeth Barrett Browning when she was eleven years old , a price three times as much as was paid for a first edition of Boswell 's " Johnson , " with autographed letters of both Johnson and Boswell thrown in . Several reasons have been advanced as to why Mr. Kern is selling his collection . The fact is , he felt it had grown to such proportions that he no longer wanted the responsibility for it . When he was away from his home he worried about it . Now , with it sold and the proceeds invested in steel bonds or some such , he can go fishing and keep his mind on the fish . John Aga ; 22 OUR item on Mr. Wanamaker last week awakened memories in at least one reader , who hastened to tell us another story about this puissant merchant . Mr. IVan M aker once ran for the Senate . His campaign speeches were distinguished for several things : for their practical logic , their thoroughness  --  and their length . On one occasion the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage . At that time Mrs. 1Vanamaker 's hearing was affected , so that she could not catch much of what her husband was saying . She did , however , catch a restlessness which grew , as time went on , among the audience , the people on the stage , and even in the family circle . After a long while , the good lady turned to one of her grandchildren and said , in a voice of mild despair which was heard for at least ten rows back , and by the candidate for the Senate himself : " Ca n't anybody stop your grandfather ? " C ivics POLICEMEN ? those brave fellows who protect your home , guide your automobile , help your aged mother across the street , apprehend your thieves , and close your speakeasies ? get paid , at the start of their careers , $1,769 a year for their pains . By a process known only to ourself , we have figured out that that 's about thirty-four dollars a week . After serving two years , a patrolman gets a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,500 , which is top for a private . We happened on these figures while chatting with a cop in front of the Fifth Avenue Bank ; and they are presented for what they are worth . In addition to their salaries from the city , the bIite CM es receive a large number of Christmas , Easter , and Labor Day presents from admirers  --  Christmas , in the more crowded districts , coining as often as once a week . Our confidant was a member of the Mounted , and we asked him about that branch . He said the horsemen get the same scale as any other cop , but that most everybody would like to he in the Mounted " because it 's exclusive . " Besides being an exclusive person , you make more friends than an unmounted cop ; your horse makes them for you , by stealing candy out of baby carriages . nuzzling little boys , and putting a hoof upon doorsteps in a cute manner . The horse receives no pay , but is retired after about ten years to a calmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on the as-sumption that Charles Lind-bergh is boyhood 's greatest figure ? the symbol of valor , the pattern of dreams  --  but this , it turns out , is not universally the case . We have just run across a little boy , the nephew of a friend , who ignores Lindbergh but has the greatest admiration for Adolph Zukor . He sits with great wide eyes and thinks about Adolph Zukor and what Adolph Zukor is doing and what Adolph Zukor would do in this case or in that case . All because his mother told him that Mr. Zukor was the man who built the Paramount Building- 1astructure the lad finds wondrous above all others . His mother , although a little worried at the strange fixation , finds that Mr. Zukor comes in handy around the house : when her son acts up and refuses to put on his heavy underwear , her quick remark is , " Adolph Zukor always wears his heavy underwear . " Old Bottles THE Museum of the New York Historical Society this month is holding an exhibit of wine labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engraved with the names of the wines , with little silver chains to loop them over the bottle 's neck . Their name in English  --  as duly established by Act of Parliament in 1784 ? is " bottle ticket . " Strangely , the French twisted the latter word into " etiquette , " and this was subsequently adopted into English as a word to signify , not good wine , but good manners ( an opportunity here for a monograph by an etymologist who has to drink bootleg gin ) . The little labels themselves are the collection of an artist , Raphael A. ? Veed , and his wife . More than three hundrcd of them are on view , and they dare from about 1770 to 1850 , when they fell into disuse . The small crescent-shaped paper label , however , still glued at the shoulder of many bottles of fine liqueurs , remains to show where they used to hang . Though Hock , Hotta nds , Rum , Madeira , Sherry are the commonest names , some were engraved for rarer vintages : Bucellas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wines whose bouquets one can but imagine nowadays . Not all of them are . of silver . Some are of ivory , enamel , or even mother-of-pearl . One set , made , we imagine , for the personal use of some roaring country squire , is of boar 's tusks . A Hindu silversmith made another set of silver mounted on tiger claws . As we stood to gaze , a young child nearby turned suddenly to his nurse , " Nurse , what is Hock ? What is Hock , Nurse ? " he demanded . An old gentleman in a white muffler , who had been dreaming there , snorted and de-. parted . The W halen Era .2ST week two policemen rang- the doorbell at the home of Efrem Zimbalist , the violinist , and his wife , Alma Gluck . A French maid answered but got absolutely nowhere with the cops , who could not speak French and were also weak at making signs . There being no one else home , the maid called the thirteen-yearold daughter of the house , who appeared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however . " We understand , " said one of them severely , " this is a speakeasy . We were sent to investigate from Commissioner Whalen 's ( ) Ea .. " The little girl was bewildered but she asked them to wait , went inside , and telephoned to her mother , who was at the hospital where Mr. Zimbalist , at the time , was confined to bed . " Mother , is this a speakeasy ? " the child asked . Miss Gluck was alarmed , but gathered herself so far as to calm the child and get the story of what was happening . She finally told her daughter to go and tell the policemen to go away unless they had a warrant . This she did and the law departed . The place : U. S. A. The time : Twentieth Century . Clinic SEATS in the Gold Room of the Savoy-Plaza were priced at two hundred dollars each this week , and the place was crowded for five days . The Fashion Merchandising Clinic was going on there and merchants from all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Incidentally , they were told how to tell the difference be tween a style and a fashion  --  the former being , when scientifically defined , merely a shape or a design , while the latter is an epidemic . Mr. Amos Parrish , long a fashion expert , got the idea for the clinic and organized it , and the present one is the second to be held . More than a hundred stores bought the two-hundred-dollar seats for their representatives this time . Montgomery Ward sent six of their people , whereas they had but one pupil at the first show , last August . Parrish started cut some years ago by supplying stores in other cities with a list of things to be seen on ladies and gentlemen on the Avenue  --  hats , colors , trinkets . Thus he was able authoritatively to tell the outlying towns what was fashionable and what was not . They were told that stickpins , say , are no longer worn , and what shades would he popular in the coming season . Parrish built up a staff of twenty-five reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count things  --  count the number of mauves as against the magentas in ladies ' gowns ; count , we suppose , the diamond greyhounds as compared to the pony's-hair Scotch terriers on ladies ' hats . As this peculiar service grew , a store receiving the service could have finger-rings counted or even gentlemen 's beards , to see what was likely to develop in these . The keen-eyed reporters became , we are assured , astonishingly proficient at spotting potential fashions . For example , one of them , some five or six years ago , noted an artificial gardenia pinned to a coat worn by Leonora Hughes when she arrived here from Europe one day , and predicted at once that it would become a popular fashion , which it did . Similarly a scout , reconnoitering in a fashionable neighborhood , saw the former Abby Rockefeller , then a miss of about seventeen , wearing a bright bandanna about her neck . This was reported as worth watching and counting , and soon every stenographer , so the romantic story goes , was wearing a bandanna . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn the same way . The clinic tries to draw lessens from history . It has pondered , for instance , the case of the manufacturers of the eighties and nineties who wasted a fortune in an unsuccessful effort to revive a waning interest in Congress gaiters , and how , in the same way , later on , great efforts were made in vain to turn women 's fancies from the hobble skirt to the pannier . It seems that now the best thing to do is count what the right people are wear ing , or have quit wearing , and abide by the whims of the ladies . No one now , not even Mr. Parrish , can tell why fashions wax and wane as they do , but the fashion people arc working on it scientifically now , Like a chemist after something he wants to learn , and they expect scion to work out a formula .
