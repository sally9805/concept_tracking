txt  | When the motives of artists are profound , when they are at their work as a result of deep consideration , when they believe in the importance of what they are doing , their work creates a stir in the world . The stir play pct be one of thanks or compliment to the artist . It may be that it will rouse two kinds of men to bi , , . t ea artagozaisra , and the artist may be more showered with abuse than praise , just as Darwin was in the start , iiedaus ' ! Le dint roduceil r , new idea into the world . The complaint that " the public do not come to our exhibitions ? they are not interested ' in art ! " is heard with a bias to the effect that it is all the public 's fault , and that there could not possibly be anything the matter with art . A thoughtful person may ponder the question and finally ask if the fault is totally on the public 's side . There are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In each class there are elements of the other class so that it is possible to develop or to degenerate and thus effect a passage from one class to the other . The true character of the student is one of great mental and spiritual activity . He arrives at conclusions and he searches to express his findings . He goes to the market place , to the exhibition place , wherever he can reach the people , to lay before them his new angle on life . He creates a disturbance , wins attention from those who have in them his kind of blood ? the student blood . These are stirred into activity . Camps are established . Discussion runs high . There is life in the air . The non-student element says it is heresy . Let us have " peace ! " Put the disturber in jail .  | In this , we have two ideas of life , motion and non-motion . If the art students who enter the schools today believe in the greatness of their profession , if they believe in self development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study accordingly , they will not find the audience wanting when they go to the market place with expressions of their ideas . They will find a crowd there ready to tear them to pieces ; to praise them and to ridicule them . Julian 's Academy , as I knew it , was a great cabaret with singing and huge practical jokes , and as such , was a wonder . It was a factory , too , where thousands of drawings of human surfaces were turned out . It is true , too , that among the great numbers of students there were those who searched each other out and formed little groups which met independently of the school , and with art as the central interest talked , and developed ideas about everything under the sun . But these small groups of true students were exceptional . An art school should be a boiling , seething place . And such it would be if the students had a fair idea of the breadth of knowledge and the general personal development necessary to the man who is to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is put down in such permanent mediums as paint or stone it should be a thing well worthy of record . It must be the work of one who has looked at all things , has interested himself in all life .  | Art has relations to science , religions and philosophies . The artist must be a student . The value of a school should be in the meeting of students . The art school should be the life-centre of a city . Ideas should radiate from it . I can see such a school as a vital power ; stimulating without and within . Everyone would know of its existence , would feel its hand in all affairs . I can hear the song , the humor , of such a school , putting its vitality into play at moments of play , and having its say in every serious matter of life . Such a school can only develop through the will of the students . Some such thing happened in Greece . It only lasted for a short time , but long enough to stock the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Schools have transformed men and men have transformed schools . When Wagner came into the world it was very different from when he left it , and he was one of the men who made the changes . Such people are very disturbing . They often create trouble , we ca n't sleep when they are around . If the art galleries of the future are to be crowded with spectators it will depend wholly on the students . If there had been no such disturbers as Wagner , auditoriums would not now be filled with listeners . When a drawing is tiresome it may be because the motive is not worth the effort .  | Be willing to paint a picture that does not look like a picture . The mere copying , without understanding , of external appearances can hardly be called drawing . It is a performance and difficult , but Every movement , every evidence of search is worthy of the consideration of the student . The student must look things squarely in the face , know them for what they are worth to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth that is in them . The battle of human evolution is going on . There must he investigations in all directions . Do not be afraid of new prophets or prophets that may he false . Go in and find out . The future is in your hands . You can learn much by a cool study of the living eye . Examine it closely and record in your mind just what and where its parts are . In pictures eyes should fascinate , arrest , haunt , question , be inscrutable , they should invite into depths . They must be remarkable . You must have your anatomical knowledge so that you can use it without consciously thinking of it , and your technique must be positive and swift . Eyes express human sensitiveness and they must be wonderfully done .  | I am sure there are many people ? and there are artists ? who have never seen a whole head . They look from feature to feature . You ca n't draw a head until you see it whole . It 's not easy . Try it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to stretch my brain in order to get it around a whole head . It seemed that I could go so far , but it was a feat to comprehend the whole . No use trying to draw a thing until you have got all around it . It is only then that you comprehend a unity of which the parts can be treated as parts . The dominant eye . Note that there is a compositional relation between the eyes ? that is , one eye commands the greater interest . If you paint them equal , no matter what the position of the head , the observer will get no right conception of them . In life one eye always dominates the observer . In painting this domination must persist . The average idea of portraiture needs reconstruction . When Rodin made his Balzac he made a great portrait . It is probably not so much what Balzac looked like to the ordinary eye ; but it is the man as Rodin understood him , and I think Rodin had unusual understanding . Keep your old work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults in it for you to study . You can learn more from yourself than you can from anyone else .  | After you have made a drawing from the model do n't simply put it away . You are not half through with it . It 's a thing to study . If you are working from day to day on a drawing , take it home . Put it where you can see it well . No one can get anywhere without contemplation . Busy people who do not make contemplation part of their business do not do much for all their effort . Study the drawing out . When you take it back before the model you will have a state of mind far in advance of the state of the drawing . If it is a drawing of a pose which is not to be continued , just the same , make your study of it ? and redraw it . Use plenty of paper . Seriousness does not mean sticking to one piece of paper or canvas . He paints like a man going over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw a leg or arm in a certain state of action and use the same no matter how unfitting it may be to the subject in hand . We see in a picture or decoration labeled " Labor , " a man with the muscles in his arms and legs bulging as though he were accomplishing some mighty feat of strength , although the use of all this terrific muscular action may be no more than the carrying home of his dinner pail.  | In drawing a man pulling on a rope , make your drawing state fully what muscles are affected by this action . Develop the power of seeing the points of action ; your keenness of sight of such muscular activities must be greater than that of the ordinary observer . In buying a horse , if you are not acquainted with horses , you will fail to recognize the fine points . You will refer to your friend who is a judge of horses and from his expert knowledge , he will be able to tell at once the signs of the horse 's power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the state , temperament , action and condition of his subject through the outward signs , and use the same as a means of expressing and making special what is important to him in the subject . In this pose our model is as much an artist as any of you . He has a distinct idea of the action he wishes to express , and he keeps well to the idea . It is a piece of good acting . If you would but put as much mind , energy and imagination in your drawing as he does in taking and holding to the spirit of his pose , good work would result . In drawing this outline you forget what the line signifies because your interest is in drawing the line only as a line . You must think more of what created the line in nature ; of the movement and the form that created it . The line is nothing in itself . Look at this drawing by Rembrandt . Your mind is at once engaged by the life of the person represented . The  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that you do not realize them as lines , but are only conscious of what they state of the living person . Here are people represented in differing actions , and each one sensed in his nature , you seem to know all about them . It is the individual significance of the persons in the action of the picture that seizes you . You have been let into that life of long ago . In this other Rembrandt drawing we see people in a tavern . Among them is an imposing client . Note the way the lines force our understanding of his pompous authority . How different each one present carries himself . In the whole composition there is a unity of line and there is a unity of group , time and place , but each personage is an identity in himself . Variety within unity . We like to look at these drawings because they carry to us just what was running through the mind of Rembrandt . They express states of life as Rembrandt understood them . They are real historical documents , not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people while they unconsciously live their lives . Ordinary histories estrange us from the past . The works of such as Rembrandt bring us near it . The personages in the Rembrandt drawings are seen as in the actions of their lives . Our model on the stand before us is equally an individual , and is at this moment doing one of the things which go to make up his or her life . This studio is no less a place where life is going on in its tragedy and comedy than any other .  | The model on the stand is a piece of history , and if you know this you will draw more interestingly , because you will see more interestingly . Life and art can not be disassociated , nor can any artist , however he may desire it , produce a line of " sheer beauty , " i.e. , a line disassociated from human feeling . We are all wrapped up in life , in human feelings ; we can not , and we should not , desire to get away from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they bear a kinship to us . Different men are moved or left cold by lines according to the difference in their natures . What moves you is beautiful to you . To all men in a general way human lines have significance . In all great paintings of still-life , flowers , fruit , landscape , you will find the appearance of interweaving human forms , the forms we unconsciously look for . We do but humanize , see ourselves in all we look at . Because we are saturated with life , because we are human , our strongest motive is life , humanity ; and the stronger the motive back of a line the stronger , and therefore the more beautiful , the line will be . In looking at certain drawings of landscape by Cezanne , I found myself first filled with a delightful sense of intimacy , of warmth and human feeling . Presently I became conscious that I was looking at a wonderful orchestration of human forms . In the trees , the rocks , the grasses ? everywhere , were variations on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symphony . Critics have written that Renoir was not interested in the people he painted , was only interested in color and  | form , that the who or what of the model was totally negligible to him . Yet one has only to look at those little children he painted , the one bending over his writing , the two girls at the piano , to cite instances ; and it will be apparent that Renoir had not only a great interest in human character , in human feeling , but had also a great love for the people he painted . He needed new inventions in technique , in color and form to express what he felt about life . His feeling was so great that his search was directed , and the result is as we have seen ? great rhythms in form and color . Because a line is beautiful in one picture is no argument that it will be beautiful in another . It is all a matter of relation . The line in a great drawing is not a slave to anatomical arrests and beginnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing arm and off from the finger tip into space . This is the principal line . This is the line which the artist draws and makes you follow . It is not necessarily a visible line to the photographic eye . It is there nevertheless and is hidden in the science of the draftsman . All else that is visible is there only to make you sense this line , and it dominates . Your eye does not follow the muscle and bone making of the arm . It follows the spirit of life in the arm . Such a line runs through the whole figure , rising from point to point in measures which are not controlled by the anatomical structure , except in the loosest way . These measures define another dimension ? that fascinating fourth if you like ? which has to do with your concept of the significance of the whole ? that ultra something which  | has always engaged your interest more than mere facts of the person standing before you . If you ask me how you are to locate these points on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only tell you that you most certainly see them and you know them well in your deeper consciousness . It will take some deep sounding to bring them into your intelligence , which is blocked too much now with an eye-seeing vision of material things , things which , however , really do not and never have had much importance to you . If in your composition of an arm , a figure , a whole canvas , you do come to see these measures and can fix them , you will find the minor forms , the little anatomies , falling wonderfully into their places , easier to do and to regulate as to their importance , than ever before . The lines which are important in an " outline " drawing are not necessarily those which edge against the background ? often the great line moves inward from this and travels across or down the forward body . In considering lines as a means of drawing , it is well to remember that the line practically does not exist in nature . It is a convention we use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you became an art student , you never saw an outline ? you never took the outline into consideration . You saw forms and these forms had character and motion . If you use lines now as a means of drawing , try to find the way to make them express what you see ? forms of definite character and movement . Do n't become a victim of line .  | There is a certain kind of penmanship made in schools which seems to draw around the letters of a word like a wire , and there is another penmanship , much more human , that seems to be the word . In drawing , there are lines which travel fast , which carry the eye over space with a surprising rapidity and land you at a nodal point , where you are forced to rest , and then take new departure at the same or a quite different speed . There are lines that are heavy , dragging , lines that have pain , and lines that laugh . A canvas may be measured with inches , but the speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist . A line may plunge you into silences , into obscurity , and may bring you out into noise and clarity . The line around the edge of a figure on a white piece of paper represents the figure 's mergence into the background ? its place in air ? and represents depths and textures . Some parts of the edge of a body are nearer you , some parts are further away ; the outline will show these distances . At places , the bone of the body is near the surface and it is hard . At other places the body is soft . The outline defines these ; hardness and softness . I am glad to hear of your plans and I wish I could be a helper , as you suggest . I understand from your letter that you would like me to write an article . This brings up , however , the matter that we have several times discussed ? whether the cobbler should stick to his last ? whether the artist should paint , and put all his 8  | energies , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both from inclination and experience , instead of lecturing , writing , going to meetings , or going into society . It was only last night that , talking to an artist friend , I regretted there was but one of me , for as I said , if there were two , I could then paint both the people and the landscape . As it is , there being but one of me , I spend six to eight hours a day in actual painting and the rest of the time getting ready for the work , or resting , and in my passage to and from the studio where I paint people , I see most beautiful landscape under rare effects slide by . And this is a true loss to me for I have the feeling , and have had considerable experience , in painting landscape . I would like to be in many activities . I think that anyone who has had the pleasures of study and work for years may be full of regret because he can not practice in all the arts . Painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite how to paint . No one has ever learned quite how to see . Sometimes we do grip the concert in a human head , and so hold it that in a way we get a record of it into paint , but the vision and expressing of one day will not do for the next . Today must not be a souvenir of yesterday , and so the struggle is everlasting . Who am I today ? What do I see today ? How shall I use what I know , and how shall I avoid being victim of what I know ? Life is not repetition . If painting were an accomplishment easy to repeat after " learning , " there would be time and energy for other practices . But good painters ( and I consider as good  | painters all those who work from the will of self-expression ) have little time to go afield . They are generally at work . And as far as sociability is concerned , they are the most social people in the world , at least so I have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caress of my hand was for the man who wrote it , for the great human sympathy of the man and his revealing gift to me through the book . I have never seen the man , do not know his outside , but I am intimately acquainted with him . His warmth is all about me . Insofar as I am capable I am his kin . I am not anxious to see how well he dances , or how well he paints . He has said what he wanted to say to me in the way he wanted and thought best to say it . I do not like the very modern fancy which makes an actor of a man as soon as he has proven himself a , , pugilist . It is true , no doubt , that if my writer is deflected from writing to dancing or painting , somewhat of his genius will appear in these arts . But why should he be deflected , since it is the man 's self we want , and he has found and developed his best way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their permanent form . It is the giving of evidence . It is the study of our lives , our environment . The American who is useful as an artist is one who studies his own life and records his experiences ; in this way he gives evidence . If a man has something to say he will find a way of saying it .  | The undercurrent and motive of all art is an individual man 's idea . From each we expect what he has to give . We desire it . It is absolutely necessary for him to give it out . What is the relation of the artist to the community ? What good does a man 's art do ? There are those in the communitywho regard the artist as a mere entertainer come with cap and bells to amuse and perform graces before a paying public . The true artist regards his work as a means of talking with men , of saying his say to himself and to others . It is not a question of pay . It is not a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he is welcomed and paid it is very good , but whether or no he must say his say . Whitman was not paid for his work either in money or in appreciation at the time he did it . What we have from him was a gift , at first ? and for long after ? unwillingly received . So also with Ibsen . They made good first . They were ridiculed first . Stevenson , the inventor , was laughed at . The Wright brothers were laughed at in the beginning . Men have to give just as the bird has to sing . The artist is teaching the world the idea of life . The man who believes that money is the thing is cheating himself . The artist teaches that the object of a man 's life should be to play as a little child plays . Only it is the play of maturity ? the play of one 's mental faculties . Therefore , we have art and invention . Art in the community has a subtle , unconscious , refining influence . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a music hall can be impaired by the music of inefficient , discordant orchestras , and for this reason poor musical performances have been forbidden in some places .  | If a poor performance could affect adversely the acoustics of a hall , would not an able performance tend to improve them ? It practically means that the presence of good art will unconsciously refine a community and that poor art will do it incalculable harm . True art strikes deeper than the surface . There is that which we call the subconscious . We do certain things and are influenced by certain things without knowing why . We hear a band play a military selection , and , though we may not be at all martially inclined , we suddenly become conscious of the fact that we have walked in step to the music . And so with a good picture . Unconsciously we fall in with the rhythm of its music . The man looks at the picture ; he attaches little importance to it ; but it does n't have to hit a man on the head to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the man does n't realize that it 's there . Look at a Homer seascape . There is order in it and grand formation . It produces on your mind the whole vastness of the sea , a vastness as impressive and as uncontrollable as the sea itself . You are made to feel the force of the sea , the resistance of the rock ; the whole thing is an integrity of nature . Landscape is a medium for ideas . We want men 's thoughts . It 's the same in other things . It is said that Wells had the right idea about writing history when he wrote The Outline , for his object was not so much to give us the dates of the various occurrences , as to tell us of the conditions of humanity . And so the various details in a landscape painting mean nothing to us if they ( lo not express some mood of nature as felt by the artist .  | It is n't sufficient that the spacing and arrangement of the composition be correct in formula . The true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his canvas as a living ' thing . Perhaps he feels the wind blowing across landscape . In this case he may use the tree to express the splendid power of the wind . It is a birch tree . It is a frail tree . It bends before the wind . You see the wind 's effect in the branches and the leaves . Everything about the tree indicates the life and force of the wind . Thus the tree becomes an eloquent symbol ; it is the medium through which the idea of the wind is expressed . The next day the artist goes out again , his active mind open to impressions , displaying interest in all directions . Again the tree attracts his attention . This time it is the tree growing ; the tree resisting the wind ; the tree with its fecundity ; the tree rising and spreading from its roots ; the tree undergoing its complete cycle of growth from the roots , deriving its nutrition from the moisture in the ground and the sap in the trunk ; the tree with the twigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in this tree the wind is blowing the wind , which is to the tree as a chasing is to the cup . There is the heart and the mind , the Puritan idea is that the mind must be master . I think the heart should be master and the mind should be the tool and servant of the heart . As it is , we give too much attention to laws and not enough to principles . The man who wants to produce art must have the emotional side first , and this must be reinforced by the practical . The man who has great emotions might burst into tears ? but that is as far as he will get if he has no practi-  | cal side . The artist must have the emotional side first , the primal cause of his being an artist , but he must also have an excellent mind , which he must command and use as a tool for the expression of his emotions . The idea , which is the primal thing for a picture , is all in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute science as it deals with materials . A great artist is both a great imaginer and a great employer of practical science . First there must be the man , then the technique . There are many ways of seeing things . When you saw the thing and it looked beautiful to you , you saw it beautifully . Paint it as it looked then . Some students possess the school they work in . Others are possessed by the school . Let a student enter the school with this advice : No matter how good the school is , his education is in his own hands . All education must be self-education . Let him realize the truth of this , and no school will be a danger to him . The school is a thing of the period . It has the faults and the virtues of the period . It either uses  | the student for its own success or the self-educating student uses it for his success . This is generally true of all schools and students of our time . It is up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses the school as a place of experience where there are both good and bad advices , where there are strengths and weaknesses , where there are facilities , and much information to be had from the instructors , and much to be gained by association with the other students . He may learn equally from the strong and the weak students . There are models to work from and a place to work in . The self-educator judges his own course , judges advices , judges the evidences about him . He realizes that he is no longer an infant . He is already a man : has his own development in process . No one can lead him . Many can give advices , but the greatest artist in the world can not point his course for he is a new man . Just what he should know , just how he should proceed can only be guessed at . A school should be an offering of opportunity , not a direction , and the student should know that the school will be good for him only to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field for activity where he will see much , hear much and where he must be a judge , selecting for his special need , and daily discovering his need . When we have bred a line of self-educators there will then be no fear of schools . Those who have done distinguished work in the past , who have opened new roadways of vision and invented techniques specific to such visions have done it in spite of environment . They have  | learned what the schools had to offer , how much , how little . Strengths and weaknesses have alike been material to their progress . Different men must learn different things . Each man must put himself as far as possible in the way of knowing what is known and he must make his choices . Everything hack of him is his heritage to use or to leave . The school is a place of strengths and weaknesses . There are things insisted upon and there are things omitted . There are all sorts of advices , good and bad , and there are advices that will serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school to educate himself and not to be educated will get somewhere . He should start out a master , piaster of such as he has , however little that may be . By being master of such as he has in the beginning it is likely he may later be master , after years of study , of much . He should not enter the school with any preconceived idea of his destiny . In fact he should be open and free . his aim should be to search deeply and work hard and let the outcome be what it may . The best art the world has ever had is but the impress left by men who have thought less of making great art than of living full and completely with all their faculties in the enjoyment of full play . From these the result is inevitable . The technique of a little individuality will be a little technique , however scrupulously elaborated it may be . However long studied it still will be a little technique ; the  | measure of the man . The greatness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuality and on the same source depends the power to acquire a technique sufficient for expression . The man who is forever acquiring technique with the idea that sometime he may have something to express , will never have the technique of the thing he wishes to ' express . Intellect should be used as a tool . The technique learned without a purpose is a formula which when used , knocks the life out of any ideas to which it is applied . The great artist has cast a glow of romance over the cafe and Bohemia . It is not that he has spent much time there . He was always too busy with his work for that . It is because when he did go for relaxation he put his wit , his humor , his vitality and all himself into it . He made things hum , turned the sordid into romance , then disappeared back to his work leaving a memory in Bohemia . Age need not destroy beauty . There are people who grow more beautiful as they grow older . If age means to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spiritual state will have its effect on the physical . A face which in the early days was only pretty or even dull , will be transformed . The eyes will attain mys-  | terious depths , there will be a gesture in the whole face of greater sensibility and all will appear coordinate . About the portrait Whistler painted of his mother I have always had a great feeling of beauty . She is old . But there is something in her face and gesture that tells of the integrity of her life . There is nothing wabbly about her face as there is in the faces of those whose integrity has been uncertain . A wonderful record of woman 's beauty would have been lost to the world if her son had seen fit to look for any other beauty than that which was present . There she sits , and in her poise one reads the history of a splendid personality . She is at once so gentle , so experienced , and so womanly strong . She may have had other beauty in her youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fills us with reverence .. ' It is more the gesture of a feature than the feature itself which interests and pleases us . The feature is the outside , its gesture manifests the inner ' life . Beauty is an intangible thing ; can not be fixed on the surface , and the wear and tear of old age on the body can not defeat it . Nor will a " pretty " face make it , for G ? pretty " faces are often dull and empty , and beauty is never dull and it fills all spaces . The lace on a woman 's wrist is an entirely different thing from lace in a shop . In the shop it is a piece of  | workmanship , on her hand it is the accentuation of her gentleness of character and refinement .

Draw everything you have drawn from the model from memory as well . Realize that a drawing is not a copy . It is a construction in very different material . A drawing is an invention . The technique of painting is very difficult , very interesting . There is no end to the study of technique . Yet more important than the lifelong study of technique is the lifelong self-education .

" But I mean it . There is reason for you to give this statement some of your best thought . You may find that this is just what is the matter with most of the people in the world ; that few are really wanting what they think they want , and that most people go through their lives without ever doing one whole thing they really want to do .

It is all a matter of the sense of these things and it is very beautiful . It is not the kind of art that is painful either in its conception or its doing . It seems to have been born of wit , and good-humored love of people and things ? seems to have come forth spontaneously ? a love song . It seems so easy and it seems so glad to exist . Beside it , the bitter duty thing , made of painful hard labor , of grinding and irritating patience ; the thing great only because of the agony it took in its making , the dully labored , witless thing , the thing without love , the thing made not for itself but to win a prize , hangs ill at ease .  | I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not interested in your skill . What do you get out of nature ? Why do you paint this subject ? What is life to you ? What reasons and what principles have you found ? What are your deductions ? What projections have you made ? ' What excitement , what pleasure do you get out of it ? Your skill is the thing of least interest to me . Do n't be a high-key or a low-key artist . Both keys belong to you . Use the key that fits . Form enveloping form . The over-modeling . I can feel the sogginess of that man 's footsteps as he comes along . He seems to be the spirit of dreary rain . A sketch that is the life of the city and river . So you are after the Japanese ? Well , do n't be so superficial about it . Get the principle of it , but not the mannerism . No one should be asked to write on any artist or art movement unless he likes the work of the artist or the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of that propagandist spirit which boosts to the skies his idol and lays everything else in the dust . We have had much of this in recent times . Nor should the " Honor List " be taken too seriously as an indication of worth . I venture to say that Thomas Eakins will be spoken of in times to come as one of the very great men in all  | American art , but he died practically unknown and received only an " honor " or two . I wonder what part in an encyclopedia of American art the truly decorative and significant work of the Indian will play . It is interesting to find that there has been going on for centuries , a very remarkable art expression right here ? pure art , not imitation , and related , somehow , to the more ancient art that existed beyond the Pacific . In a great many writings and in much conversation I have noted a tendency to consider the paintings of a man who has never been abroad more American than those of a man who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left his American spirit in Philadelphia when he went to Europe . It is quite possible for a man to live all his life in California and paint as a disciple of the Barbazon school and for another to spend most of his life in the forest of Fontainbleau and show his California birth from beginning to end . After all the error rests in the mistaken idea that the subject of a painting is the object painted . Some men are so provincial that , put them where you will , they will be and do according to their home kind . Others will react to the outside world as the men of their nation feel . But in the great ones , of which a nation may be proud , the race speaks . The greatest American , of whom the nation must be proud , will not be a " typical " American at all , but will be heir to the world instead of a part of it , and will go to every place where he feels he may find something of the  | information he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is easier , I think , to paint a good picture than it is to paint a bad one . The difficulty is to have the will for it . A good picture is a fruit of all your great living . There are terrible pictures that have taken time and pain to make , intricate and difficult , results of grinding patience , research , great amalgamations of material . They frighten the sensitive student for the message they carry is of the pain and boredom of their making . Do n't take me as an authority . I am simply expressing a very personal point of view . Nothing final about it . You have to settle all these matters for yourself . Houses , housetops , like human beings have wonderful character . The lives of housetops . The wear of the seasons . The country is beautiful , young , growing things . The majesty of trees . The backs of tenement houses are living documents . Blunder ahead with your own personal view . Make the man 's feet grip the ground .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth throughout . Some times your tree must be so specialized that an expert on trees would be fully satisfied . Other times it does not matter if it is even surely a tree . Your pictures seem to be made up of things seen in nature plus a memory of pictures you have liked . The percentage of the latter is often too great . Make the hill express its bulk as a hill . Make the wagon express its carrying power . I am not interested in color for color sake and light for light sake . I am interested in them as means of expression . The eye should not be led where there is nothing to see . A satisfactory painting of a head is almost the highest piece of composition . I regard the salons of Paris and the big annuals as institutions detrimental to art . Art should not be segregated to a certain six weeks in the year . Art should be persistent ; exhibitions should be small . Every one enjoys Fifth Avenue , because there a series of very small exhibitions occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for they are not beyond our endurance and because they are  | divided into groups , a group in each gallery ; we are thus enabled to see more and enjoy more than were they smashed together in one great hodge-podge . And on Fifth Avenue art is persistent ; we can always find something there in all seasons . The Big Show should not be desired . All over the world art has been made into a three-ringed circus with salons . All who are familiar with modern art history know the " salon pictures " as a special and very overgrown and mongrel breed . Letter , 1916 The question of development of the art spirit in all walks of life interests me . I mean by this , the development of individual judgment and taste , the love of work for the sake of doing things well , tendency toward simplicity and order . If anything can be done to bring the public to a greater consciousness of the relation between art and life , of the part each person plays by exercising and ' developing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " authority , " it would be well . Moreover , if the buyers of pictures could be brought to believe that , whatever may be their interest in accredited old masters , they have , equally with the artists , their part to play in the development and the progress of art in our own time and place ? that they , too , should enter the struggle for today 's expression , lending a full support by purchasing the works of the strugglers and searchers of our day and risking  | many mistakes in their purchases , just as the artists are risking many mistakes in their efforts ? it would be of public benefit . To have art in America will not be to sit like a packrat on a pile of collected art of the past . It will be rather to build our own projection on the art of the past , wherever it may be , and for this constructiveness , the artist , the man of means and the man in the street should go hand in hand . And to have art in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater humanity , a finer sense of relation through all things . Few of our art critics are constructive . There is much little quibbling . I should like to see every encouragement for those who are fighting to open new ways , every living worker helped to do what he believes in , the best he can . The nian of means should take his chance in the struggle , making mistakes in judgment along with the rest of us ? a worker in the developments of his own time . Out of it all , what is good will survive and will be known later ; what is bad or negligible will pass and we shall have lived . Go and see the picture . I know you will like it . Put on a pair of false whiskers so you wo n't be bothered . I am thinking of a series of disguises for myself so that I can go to picture galleries and look at the pictures , and think about them . There should be an art law prohibiting friends from recognizing each other in art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would suggest a " social " room adjoining each picture gallery where we could retire with friends , and ask and answer , " Where did you go this summer ? " Do n't make your picture like a picture , make it like nature . The result will be a picture just the same , but it will be a new picture . Do n't let the painting of your background be the technique of seeping rain , nor that of tall grasses . Your background is mainly air in which is enveloped the distant curtain seen not with a direct eye . Your eyes are still looking into those of the model . Order is perceived by the man with a creative spirit . It is achieved by the man who sincerely attempts to express himself and thus naturally follows organic law . I think that this search for order , which is the artist 's work , produces orderliness not only in mind , but in body . In my own experience I have sometimes felt all in , disturbed , not fit , but have had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In an hour 's work I have  | found myself O. K. , fine , and at the end of the three or four or five hours ' work have been tired , but altogether in better shape than when I started . I have had the same experience when I have had to talk to a class of students . Often I start , very tired from other work , or distracted by little annoyances , with nothing to say and no invention in saying it , but am forced by the engagement to go on . Presently , as I make the struggle for orderly and relative ideas , the fatigue rolls away , order begets order , and a healthy state of mind and body exists . And again at the end I am tired , but in better condition than when I started . There is more than one way to rest and to recuperate , and it amuses me to say the paradox ? that resting is often very fatiguing . Of course , on the other hand , we find among artists and art students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dash at their work in a wild splashing frenzy , without reason , without an interest in finding the way , just wanting the goal , screaming and stamping their feet to get it ? not interested in the process of getting it . Such as these , practicing in disorder , wear themselves out , destroy . To study art is to study order , relative values , to get at fundamental constructive principles . It is the great study of the inside , not the outside of nature . Such a pursuit evokes justice , simplicity , and good health . Berthe Morisot learned a great deal from Manet , but she expressed her own , a woman 's , vision .  | Art is not in pictures alone . Its place is in everything , as much in one thing as another . It is up to the community as a whole , in conduct , business , government and play . We will never have an art America until this is understood , and when this idea is really understood it will bring us about as near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe very much in the importance of a thorough study of the materials used . Their quality as to durability . An artist may not be a chemist but he can ascertain much from the books written by authorities . I believe in the study of technique . One should know as far as possible all the possibilities of a medium . I am not interested in technical stunts , in bravura . I am interested in simple expression . Not interested in painting the surface of things . Paint must be so simply managed that it will carry understanding past the material fact . Painting should never look as if it were done with difficulty , however difficult it may actually have been . Motive demands specific technique . Without motive , painting is only some sort of difficult jugglery . The finer the motive , the more the artist sees significance in what he looks at , the more he must be precise in the choice of his terms .  | Individuality and Freedom in Art * It seems to me that before a man tries to express anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a new one , very distinct from others . Walt Whitman did this , and that is why I think his name so often comes to me . The one great cry of Whitman was for a man to find himself , to understand the fine thing he really is if liberated . Most people , either by training or inheritance , count themselves at the start as " no good , " or " second rate " or " just like anyone else , " whereas in everyone there is the great mystery ; every single person in the world has evidence to give of his own individuality , providing he has acquired the full power to make clear this evidence . Twachtman was one of the men in America who could see the greatness of life about him . It chanced that he lived much in Connecticut and saw it there , but he would have found it in Spain or France or Russia , and had he gone to paint in those countries his art would have still been American . To me Twatchman is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of his environment and developed for himself a matchless technique . It is thus that art history must grow . There is no one recipe for this making of American artists , beyond affording to the men who have the gift the opportunity for supreme development and the right expression of it . For instance , contrast the work of Twachtman and Winslow Homer . The same scene presented by these two caption* From article in The Craftsman , 1909.  | men would be not an identical geographical spot but an absolutely different expression of personality . Twachtman saw the seas bathed in mists , the rocks softened with vapor . Winslow Homer looked straight through the vapor at the hard rock ; he found in the leaden heaviness a most treinendously forceful idea . It was not the sea or the rock to either of these men , but their own individual attitude toward the beauty or the force of nature . Each man must take the material that he finds at hand , see that in it there are the big truths of life , the fundamentally big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of his pleasure . It is not so much the actual place or the immediate environment ; it is personal greatness and personal freedom which demands a final right art expression . A man must he master of himself and master of his word to achieve the full realization of himself as an artist . That necessity is the mother of invention is true in art as in science . It is a question of saying the thing that a person has to say . A man should not care whether the thing he wishes to express is art or not , whether it is a picture or not , he should only care that it is a statement of what is worthy f o put into permanent expression . In my understanding of color , there is absolutely no such thing as color for color 's sake . Colors are beautiful w hen they are significant . Lines are beautiful when they are significant . It is what they signify that is beautiful to  | us , really . The color is the means of expression . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red in a young girl 's cheek , is beautiful , is that it manifests youth , health ; in another sense , that it manifests her sensibility . We want inventors all through life ; the only people that ever succeed in writing , painting , sculpture , manufacturing , in finance , are inventors . Every stave in a picket fence should be drawn with wit , the wit of one who sees each stave as new evidence about the fence . The staves should not repeat each other . A new fence is rather stiff , but it does not stand long before there is a movement through it , which is the trace of its life experience . The staves become notes , and as they differ the wonder of a common picket fence is revealed . Artists are sometimes asked , " Why do you paint ugly and not beautiful things ? " The questioner rarely hesitates in his judgment of what is beautiful and what is ugly . This with him is a foregone conclusion . Beauty he thinks is a settled fact . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , not in the expression . He should , therefore pay high for Rembrandt 's portrait of a gentleman , and turn with disgust from a beggar by Rembrandt . Fortunately Rembrandt is old enough not to have this happen , and the two , the gentleman and the beggar , flank  | each other on the walls in fine places . But the lesson has not been learned . The idea still remains , that beauty rests in the subject . The artist wants to paint the baby as he has seen it in the naturalness of its usual clothes . The mother wants it painted in its new dress and cap . There is nothing left of the baby but a four-inch circle of a fractional face , all the rest is new clothes . Many things pass in the course of a day . Idle philanthropy is a sort of disease . It is all very well to form societies for the Encouragement of Deserving Young Artists , and people go at these things with a spirit of benevolence and a faith in their infallibility that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing , and do not realize that what they have undertaken is as much a matter of mind as it is of heart . The plan is usually to pick out the deserving and presently to give prizes to the most deserving . I ask , " How are we old fellows to know when a young fellow is deserving ? " and the stare I get as an answer means , " Why , who should know if not we great old fellows ? " and they say , " We will have a committee , a jury ! " Throughout the whole history of art , committees and juries , whoever composed them have failed to pick winners . Oh yes , there are a few instances , but they are so few that they only serve as exceptions to prove the rule .  | To cite one great instance . Take the history of art in France . Practically every artist who today stands a glory to French art was rejected and repudiated by the committees and juries . So the young artists are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old fellows , are to hand down by our judgment encouraging awards to the little fledglings . How does the young artist look at it ? If these young artists are really deserving it must be because they have already ideas and opinions which belong to them , and their generation . It is quite likely they do n't want our judgment . Are we not too anxious to have our fingers in their pie as well as in our own ? Ca n't we ever realize that it is not for the old to judge the young ? that it is the young who must judge the old ? To award prizes is to attempt to control the course of another man 's work . It is a bid to have him do what you will approve . It affects not only the one who wins the award , but all those who in any measure strive for it . It t is an effort to stop evolution , to hold things back to the 1 plane of your judgment . It is a check on a great adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that youth should go forward . It is for the coming generation to judge you , not for you to judge it . So it must happen , whether you will it or not . If you want to be useful , if you want to be an encouragement to the deserving young artist , do n't try to pick him or judge him , but become interested in his effort with keen willingness to accept the surprises of its outcome .  | To struggle for an open forum for exhibition without the control of juries , and for greater opportunity to all for self-education , means an exercise not only of benevolence but of mind . To do this is not to be an old fellow reposing in the past and interfering with the future . It is part of the building of greater opportunity , and whoever participates in it is still alive and young , and will profit by it , for in the field he has helped to open there will grow new and wonderful things , and among them he may choose and judge in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , not for others . He may award with his personal appreciation , or pass money by purchasing , but this will be a personal affair . I repeat , if our attempt to help young artists is to be by giving them prizes which we award , we demand of them that they please us ? whether they please themselves or not . Let the work they do get its honor in being what it is . Prizes generally go amiss . The award of prizes has the effect of setting up a false discrimination . We must realize that artists are not in competition with each other . Help the young artists ? find for them means to make their financial ways easier , that they may develop and fruit their fullest ? but let us not ask them to please us in doing it . If we find , individually , that any of their works please us , let us buy as far as we can , and rouse others to buy from them according to their personal choice . In doing this there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this way participators in the new adventures , it is likely that our powers of judgment will  | broaden . I can not conceive of myself as a buyer only of old pictures ? turning my back on the adventures of today . Finally , I say ? do n't force the prize game on the " deserving young artist " ? leave it for the old children of our own generation to play with and let it die with them . Appreciation of life is not easy . One says he must earn a living ? but why ? Why live ? It seems as though a great many who do earn the living or have it given them do not get much out of it . A sort of aimless racing up and down in automobiles , an aimless satisfaction in amassing money , an aimless pursuit of " pleasure , " nothing personal , all external . I have known people who have sat for years in the cafes of Bohemia , who never once tasted of that spirit which has made life in Bohemia a magnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply present . Really bored to death although they did not know it , and poisoned too by the food and drink ? being inert they were open prey to it . They and their kind , in the various ways , are in hot pursuit of something they are not fitted to attain . It takes wit , and interest and energy to be happy . The pursuit of happiness is a great activity . One must be open and alive . It is the greatest feat man has to accomplish , and spirits must flow . There must be courage . There are no easy ruts to get into which lead to happiness . A man must become interesting to himself and must become actually expressive before he can be happy . I do not say that these people are devoid of the possibility of happiness , but they have not been enough interested in their real  | selves to have awareness of the road when they are on it . They no doubt fall into moments of supreme pleasure , which they enjoy , whether consciously or unconsciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from suicide . There are , however , others who do recognize their great moments , and who go after them with all their strength . Walt Whitman seems to have found great things in the littlest things of life . It beats all the things that wealth can give and everything else in the world to say the things one believes , to put them into form , to pass them on to anyone who may care to take them up . There is the hope of happiness ? a hope of development , that some day we may get away from these self-imposed dogmas and establish something that will make music in the world and make us natural . Of course , if a man were to plump suddenly into the world with the gift of telling the actual truth and acting rightly , he would not fit into our uncertain state , he would certainly be very disturbing ? and most probably we would send him to jail . We have n't arrived yet , and it is foolish to believe that we have . The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My People " * THE people I like to paint are " my people , " whoever they may be , wherever they may exist , the people through whom dignity of life is manifest , that is , who are in some caption* Article in The Craftsman , 1915.  | way expressing themselves naturally along the lines nature intended for them . My people may be old or young , rich or poor , I may speak their language or I may communicate with them only by gestures . But wherever I find them , the Indian at work in the white man 's way , the Spanish gypsy moving back to the freedom of the hills , the little boy , quiet and reticent before the stranger , my interest is awakened and my impulse immediately is to tell about them through my own language ? drawing and painting in color . I find as I go out , from one land to another seeking " my people , " that I have none of that cruel , fearful possession known as patriotism ; no blind , intense devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own making . My love of mankind is individual , not national , and always I find the race expressed in the individual . And so I am " patriotic " only about what I admire , and my devotion to humanity burns up as brightly for Europe as for America ; it flares up as swiftly for Mexico if I am painting the peon there ; it warms toward the bull-fighter in Spain , if , in spite of its cruelty , there is that element in his art which I find beautiful ; it intensifies before the Irish peasant , whose love , poetry , simplicity and humor have enriched my existence , just as completely as though each of these people were of my own country and my own hearthstone . Everywhere I see at times this beautiful expression of the dignity of life , to which I respond with a wish to preserve this beauty of humanity for my friends to enjoy . This thing that I call dignity in a human being is inevitably the result of an established order in the universe .  | Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no order unless things are in their right relation to each other . Of this right relation throughout the world beauty is born . A musical scale , the sword motif for instance in the Ring , is order in sound ; sculpture as the Greeks saw it , big , sure , infinite , is order in proportion ; painting , in which the artist has the wisdom that ordained the rainbow is order in color ; poetry , ? Whitman , Ibsen , Shelley , each is supreme order in verbal expression . It is not too much to say that art is the noting of the existence of order throughout the world , and so , order stirs imagination and inspires one to reproduce this beautiful relationship existing in the universe , as best one can . Everywhere I find that the moment order in nature is understood and freely shown , the result is nobility ; ? the Irish peasant has nobility of language and facial expression ; the North American Indian has nobility of poise , of gesture ; nearly all children have nobility of impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold together , and it is a vision of orderliness that enables the artist along any line whatsoever to capture and present through his imagination the wonder that stimulates life . It is disorder in the mind of man that produces chaos of the kind that brings about such a war as we are today overwhelmed with . It is the failure to see the various phases of life in their ultimate relation that brings about militarism , slavery , the longing of one nation to conquer another , the willingness to destroy for selfish unhuman purposes . Any right understanding of the proper relation of man to man and man to the universe would make war impossible . The revolutionary parties that break away from old  | institutions , from dead organizations are always headed by men with a vision of order , with men who realize that there must be a balance in life , of so much of what is good for each man , so much to test the sinews of his soul , so much to stimulate his joy . But the war machine is invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no order in the seclusion of the world 's good for the minority , and the battle for this proves the complete disorganization of the minds who institute it . War is impossible without institutionalism , and institutionalism is the most destructive agent to peace or beauty . When the poet , the painter , the scientist , the inventor , the laboring man , the philosopher , see the need of working together for the welfare of the race , a beautiful order will be the result and war will be as impossible as peace is today . Although all fundamental principles of nature are orderly , humanity needs a fine , sure freedom to express these principles . When they are expressed freely , we find grace , wisdom , joy . We only ask for each person the freedom which we accord to nature , when we attempt to hold her within our grasp . If we are cultivating fruit in an orchard , we wish that particular fruit to grow in its own way ; we give it the soil it needs , the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not treat the apple tree as we would the pear tree or the peach tree as we would the vineyard on the hillside . Each is allowed the freedom of its own kind and the result is the perfection of growth which can be accomplished in no other way . The time must come when the same freedom is allowed the individual ; each in his own way must develop according to nature 's purpose , the body must be but the channel for the expres-  | sion of purpose , interest , emotion , labor . Everywhere freedom must be the sign of reason . We are living in a strange civilization . Our mind 's and souls are so overlaid with fear , with artificiality , that often we do not even recognize beauty . It is this fear , this lack of direct vision of truth that brings about all the disaster the world holds , and how little opportunity we give any people for casting off fear , for living simply and naturally . When they do , first of all we fear them , then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to outlive our condemnation that we accept them . Always we would try to tie down the great to our little nationalism ; whereas every great artist is a man who has freed himself from his family , his nation , his race . Every man who has shown the world the way to beauty , to true culture , has been a rebel , a " universal " without patriotism , without home , who has found his people everywhere , a man whom all the world recognizes , accepts , whether he speaks through music , painting , words or form . Each genius differs only from the mass in that he has found freedom for his greatness ; the greatness is everywhere , in every man , in every child . What our civilization is busy doing , mainly , is smothering greatness . It is a strange anomaly ; we destroy what we love and we reverence what we destroy . The genius who is great enough to cut through our restraint wins our applause ; yet if we have our own way we restrain him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius and then we begin to establish our rules and our laws , until we have made all expression within the commonplace . We build up our religion upon  | the life of the freest men that ever lived , the men who refused all limitation , all boundaries , all race kinship , all family ties ; and then we circumscribe our religion until the power that comes from the organization blinds and binds its adherents . We would circumscribe our music , we would limit the expression of our painter , we would curb our sculpture , we would have a fixed form for our poet if we could . Fortunately , however , the great , significant , splendid impulse for beauty can force its way through every boundary . Wagner can break through every musical limitation ever established , Rodin can mold his own outline of the universe , Whitman can utter truths so burning that the edge of the sonnet , roundelay , or epic is destroyed , Millet meets his peasant in the field and the Academy forgets to order his method of telling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Puritan , for he guided his life against desire and against nature . He found what he thought was comfort , for he believed the spirit 's safety was in negation , but he has never given the world one minute 's joy or produced one symbol of the beautiful order of nature . He sought peace in bondage and his spirit became a prisoner . Technique is to me merely a language , and as I see life more and more clearly , growing older , I have but one intention and that is to make my language as clear and simple and sincere as is humanly possible . I believe one should study ways and means all the while to express one 's idea of life more clearly . The language of color must of necessity vary . There are great things in the world to paint , night , day , brilliant moments , sunrise , a people in  | the joy of freedom ; and there are sad times , half-tones in the expression of humanity , so there must be an infinite variety in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value for its own sake , it is so only as it expresses the infinite moods and growth of humanity . An artist must first of all respond to his subject , he must be filled with emotion toward that subject and then he must make his technique so sincere , so translucent that it may be forgotten , the value of the subject shining through it . To my mind a fanciful , eccentric technique only hides the matter to be presented , and for that reason is not only out of place , but dangerous , wrong . All my life I have refused to be for or against parties , for or against nations , for or against people . I never seek novelty or the eccentric ; I do not go from land to land to contrast civilizations . I seek only , wherever I go , for symbols of greatness , and as I have already said , they may be found in the eyes of a child , in the movement of a gladiator , in the heart of a gypsy , in twilight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of greatness is in my mind what the world was created for . The human body is beautiful as this spirit shines through , and art is great as it translates and embodies this spirit . Since my return from the Southwest , where I saw many great things in a variety of human forms , ? the little Chinese-American girl , who has found coquetry in new freedom ; the peon , a symbol of a destroyed civilization in Mexico , and the Indian who works as one in slavery and dreams as a man in still places ? I have been reproached with not adding to my study of these people the background of their lives . This has astonished me because all  | their lives are in their expressions , in their eyes , their movements , or they are not worth translating into art . I was not interested in these people to sentimentalize over them , to mourn over the fact that we have destroyed the Indian , that we are changing the shy Chinese girl into a soubrette , that our progress through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not what I am on the outlook for . I am looking at each individual with the eager hope of finding there something of the dignity of life , the humor , the humanity , the kindness , something of the order that will rescue the race and the nation . That is what I have wanted to talk about and nothing else . The landscape , the houses , the workshop of these people are not necessary . I do not wish to explain these people , I do not wish to preach through them , I only want to find whatever of the great spirit there is in the Southwest . If I can hold it on my canvas I am satisfied , for after all , every race , every individual in the race must develop as nature intended or become extinct . These things belong to the power of the ages . I am only seeking to capture what I have discovered in a few of the people . Every nation in the world in spite of itself , produces the occasional individual that does express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural growth . It is this element in people which is the essence of life , which springs out away from the institution , which is the reformation upon which the institution is founded , which laughs at all boundaries and which in every generation is the beginning , the birth of new greatness , which holds in solution all genius , all true progress , all significant beauty .  | It seems to me that this very truth accounts for the death of religions . The institutionalized religion doubts humanity , whereas truth itself rests upon faith in humanity . The minute we shut people up we are proving our distrust in them ; if we believe in them we give them freedom , and through freedom they accomplish , and nothing else matters in the world . We harness up the horse , we destroy his very race instincts , and when we want a thrill for our souls we watch the flight of the eagle . This has been true from the beginning of time . It is better that every thought should be uttered freely , fearlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear of evil . It is only through complete independence that all goodness can be spoken , that all purity can be found . Even indecency is bred of restriction not of freedom , for how can the spirit which controls the ethical side of life be trusted except through the poise that is gained by exercise ? When we think honestly , we never desire individuals bound hand and foot , and the ethical side of man 's nature we can not picture as overwhelmed and smothered with regulations if we are to have a permanent human goodness ; for restrictions hide vice , and freedom alone bears morality . I wonder when , as a nation , we shall ever learn the difference between freedom and looseness , between restriction and destruction , ? so far we certainly have not . When people have the courage to think honestly , they will live honestly , and only through transparent honesty of life will a new civilization be born . The people who think and live sincerely will bear children who have a vision of the truth , children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere if we are to overcome such civilizations as we see falling to pieces today , not only health of body , but health of mind . Humanity today is diseased , it is proving itself diseased in murder , fire , hideous atrocity . The more health we have in life the fewer laws we will have , for health makes for happiness and laws for the destruction of both . If as little children , we were enabled to find life so simple , so transparent that all the beautiful order of it were revealed to us , if we knew the rhythm of Wagner , the outline of Pericles , if color were all about us beautifully related , we should acquire this health and have the vision to translate our lives into the most perfect art of any age or generation . I sometimes wonder what my own work would have been if I could as a child have heard Wagner 's music , played by great musicians . I am sure the rhythm of it would have influenced my own work for all time . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been surrounded by such art as 11MIichaelangelo 's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel , where he paints neither religion nor paganism , but that third estate which Ibsen suggests " is greater than what we know ; " if these things had been my environment , I feel that a greater freedom of understanding and sympathy would have come to me . Freedom is indeed the great sign which should be written on the brow of all childhood . There are other things I should like to speak of which have been important to me as a painter . In addition to a sense of freedom , a sure belief that only the very essence of the universe was worth capturing and holding , perhaps  | one of the most valuable things for the painter to study is economy , which is necessary in every phase of life , almost the most valuable asset a man can possess . But in painting especially , a man should learn to select from all experience , not only from his own but from that of all ages , essential beauty . IIe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vital and express that with the keenest delight and emotion . The art that has lasted through all ages has been culled in this way from often what seemed meagre opportunity . Beethoven must have captured his Ninth Symphony only through the surest understanding of what was essential to hold and translate to the world . He was not listening carelessly or recklessly to the melody which is held on the edge of the infinite for the man with spiritual ears ; rather he was eager , intense , sure , wise and economical as he gathered beauty and distilled it into that splendid harmony which must forever hold the world captive . And so all great music , great prose , everything beautiful must depend upon the sure , free measure with which it is garnered and put into language for the people , for each lovely thing has its intrinsic value and belongs in its own position for the world to study , understand and thrive upon . In various ways the free people of the world will find and translate the beauty that exists for them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , the sculptor closer to nature , feeling her forms , needing her inspiration ; the poet from the simple people in remote countries ; the painter it seems to me , mainly from all kinds and conditions of people , from humanity in the making , in the living . Each man must seek for himself the people who hold the  | essential beauty , and each man must eventually say to himself as I do , " these are my people and all that I have I owe to them . " There is the new movement . There always has been the new movement and there always will be the new movement . It is strange that a thing which comes as regularly as clockwork should always be a surprise . In new movements the pendulum takes a great swing , charlatans crowd in , innocent apes follow , the masters make their successes and they make their mistakes as all pioneers must do . It is necessary to pierce to the core to get at the value of a movement and not be confused by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , a white collar , a brown coat , black tie , black hair , gray background . I have named enough things to make a great picture . Get the most expressive design out of these , each one treated as a simple mass . See how much beauty in shape can be got out of the association of these notes : flesh , collar , coat , tie , hair , background . They must all fit into the area of the canvas . They must act and react on each other as the notes in music act and react on each other . These six notes may , through their contrasts of shape , of color , of texture , produce powerful emotion . To work this way is to work as a designer . All good drawing or painting is compositional .  | Better see what you can do on your canvas with these simple notes and for the time being let all details go . It is useless to keep on adding things to a canvas . Some painters put thousands of big and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All day long they keep adding more and more . They are like whales in a sea with their mouths wide open swallowing everything that comes along . Much can be done with little . Many times in the work of the class I see things which are equal to the greatest . Flashes of truth and a technique so simple and , comprehensive that nothing could be better . Flashes come before a steady flame and flashes come only to die out . Your work is intensely interesting to me . I come always to the class with expectancy . If one could only know better when he has touched near the truth . We are troubled by having two selves , the inner and the outer . The outer one is rather dull and lets great things go by . To a Teacher If I were you I would prefer a short and courageous career in art teaching to one that would be prolonged by hedgings . What does it matter if by standing for the  | thing you really believe in , fighting for it , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have used in your own conviction , ma , : ? : g no weak concessions , you fail . Such failure is success . You keep your likeness , anyhow . Besides , you can depend on it , there are everywhere some people who will recognize your wisdom , truth and courage , and you will be well repaid by having won the appreciation of such people , even if you come back , as a result , out of a job and strapped . Many people would denounce what I have said as sentimental or even wild fanaticism . But do n't be fooled . The diplomatic hedger is all about us . You and I have seen many of them grow up and develop their game . Some of them have bank accounts , and are very respectable and safe citizens , but we are well aware of the price paid and know it is far too dear . There are two classes of human beings . One has ideas , which it believes in fully , perhaps , but modifies to bring about " success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must carry out absolutely ; success or no success . The first class has a tremendous majority , and they are all slaves . The second class are the only free people in the world . Some are kept under the grind of poverty . Some are sent to jail , but they are still the only free class . But the latter class does not always get ground under the heel , nor sent to jail . People are not always fools . There are those who only want " to be shown , " want to know , and there must be someone who has the courage to show them . These are the words of the old teacher before you again ? get mad at me if you like ? but it 's the same as I used to say when I was teacher and you were pupil , and it was such ideas , in which you then saw truth and value , that made you come to hear me . And  | it is because there are many people who are not fools and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conventions of institutions , there has always been a place open for me , although there has never been a time that failure has not been predicted . You go into a great cathedral and the impression may be deep upon you . Must you define what you have felt ? If you can you are a poet ? an artist . There are cathedrals which have measures of great and many meanings . The principles manifest in a Beethoven symphony are those of orderly growth . A government could be constructed on the principle of a Beethoven symphony . The principle of growth is important to your student who wishes to prepare himself ' before entering the art school . He should take such studies as lead to this knowledge . An unrestricted study of sociology should interest him , for he must be intensely humane . And in mathematics he should go just as far as he can , for proportion is his means of expression . Ability to copy lines , shapes , tones , amounts to little . Ability to correlate lines , shapes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist . All good art is composition . A portrait that is not a composition is not a portrait .  | The painter deals with areas . He should know areas . A line is not good because it is like a line . A line is good because of its power related to other lines , which are powers . Every line , area , tone , value , texture , in fact every effect produced in any way , including even the pressure of the brush , should be considered as a compositional or constructive element . The substructure must be understood . Any deviation in " finish " from the principle of the substructure is weakness and death to the thing as a work of art . It is clear to see how a thorough knowledge of geometry would be valuable to the artist whose ideas are to be expressed in apparently magical proportions . It would be well for the artist to get his training in mathematics early so that his use of such knowledge will be " instinctive " later on . He should know while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his later work . I am not proposing a " scientifically hampered " artist , but one who is unhampered by ignorance , who understands well the means he employs . As to study for those in the industrial arts , I should say that the same principles as above mentioned should apply , for art is art , whether on a canvas , in stone , on a book cover , an advertisement or a piece of furniture . In the class-study the current methods of hand and eye and very little head or heart procedure should be given up . There are thousands of art students in every big city . Art schools and art students . The schools have thousands , but  | they turn out few artists , and most that do turn out well are school renegades . The methods have not been the best . Lines and forms should be regarded by the student from the very beginning as compositional factors , as measures . The exterior of the model is not the model . Any boy or girl sees more than the exterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of the art school of today bring them back to the surface so that they see the model in the terms of the surface and not in the terms of reality , and so their drawings and the art they produce may be but the negligible skill and trick , which have vogue for a while , and then die . Lines and forms are not fixed things . They compose differently to different sensibilities , and to the same observer they change their endings and beginnings ( although the model has not moved ) because the individual can not see always the same . He is sometimes his greater , sometimes his lesser self . The student , from the beginning , should evoke his greater self , realize that his work is a matter of construction ( and a different construction from that generally conceived in the art school ) . The difference between light and artist 's pigments should be studied . They should not be confounded . He should note the similarities which exist in color and music . Intervals of color across the spectrum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Intervals in the mixing of colors with white and the constructive power which rests in the opposition of warm colors to cold colors . I am not interested in art as a means of making a living , but I am interested in art as a means of living a life . It is the most important of all studies , and all studies are tributary to it . I hope to see the heads of educational institutions give up the idea that their art teaching should be such as will prepare the student to earn the greatest amount of money . Art is certainly not a pursuit for anyone who wants to make money . There are ever so many other better ways . In the past every step of human progress has been directed by art and science . These two are inseparable , and can not exist in their pure sense , the one without the other . Theirs has been the effort to apprehend from nature the principles by which we must live if we are to extricate ourselves from the uncertainties and misunderstandings in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that art study should not be directed towards a commercial end . Educational institutions should assist the student and the public to a better understanding of the meaning of the word " art " and the need of study and individual development . Letter of Criticism Advice about your paintings is difficult . As I said to you before , I can not interest myself in whether they will pass juries or not . More paintings have been spoiled  | during the process of their making , through such considerations , than the judgments of juries are worth . The object of painting a picture is not to make a picture ? however unreasonable this may sound . The picture , if a picture results , is a by-product and may be useful , valuable , interesting as a sign of what has past . The object , which is back of every true work of art , is the attainment of a state of being , a state of high functioning , a more than ordinary moment of existence . In such moments activity is inevitable , and whether this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue , its result is but a byproduct of the state , a trace , the footprint of the state . These results , however crude , become dear to the artist who made them because they are records of states of being which he has enjoyed and which he would regain . They are likewise interesting to others because they are to some extent readable and reveal the possibilities of greater existence . The picture is a by-product of such states as it is in the nature of man to desire . The object therefore is the state . We may even be negligible of the by-product , for it will be , inevitably , the likeness of its origin , however crude . It is for this reason that we find at times works by children , or by savages , little acquainted with the possibilities of the materials they have left their impress on , and scant of tools to work with , filled with such qualities as to cause us to hail them as great works of art . The need of activity , or expression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of technical research . We make our discoveries of technique while in the  | state because then we are clear sighted . But at all times we are engaged in research . Our object is to be ready . If a certain kind of activity , such as painting , becomes the habitual mode of expression it may follow that taking up the painting materials and beginning work with them will act suggestively and so presently evoke a flight into the higher state . There are artists who find themselves always at the easel saying that they want to be there , tools in hand ; in the saddle urging on the great departure . Contemplative appreciation of a trace ; a picture , hearing music , observing a graceful gesture , may cause the spirit to flame up . We care for and treasure the traces of states of greater living , fuller functioning , because we want to live also , and they inspire to living . That is the value of " a work of art . " The traces are inevitable . The living is the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age and have been so young at great age is that to such extent they have lived living , whereas most people live dying . The states of which I have spoken are healthy states . they are natural ? not supernatural . In them the mind and body , all the man , is in a state of order , perfect for functioning . Each time he attains the state he gains not only the greater life of the moment but an effect on mind and body which is lasting . I have spoken of activity being inevitable as a result of such states , and the ancient Hindoo might be cited , sitting in contemplative inactivity , as refutal of this , but it is well to note that the only ground we have to believe in the  | loftiness of his contemplation has been through his words or his acts , however seldom these have taken place . The activity need not be violent or continuous . The Hindoo 's state of contemplation is many times referred to as supreme or pure because of near total negation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of his contemplation he has touched material things . He has left the trace which we may read . Purity is in the state , in being in the state , because the state is true living . Things touched while in this state are transformed into a likeness of the state . The stone of the ancient Greeks was so transformed ' . The Hindoo denied the world and died of this denial . The Greek acknowledged the world and commanded it , made stone and the many things of life subservient to his state . The world won from him in the end , but his step was a stage gained in man 's struggle to live in full function . What we have that is great in old India is of those periods where man was so well in the state that he had no fear of material and made of it a vehicle of expression . His object was not to make Art . Isis object was to live . He did not fear what he touched as a result of the activity created by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the activity engendered by it , the inevitable happened ? the by-product ? art ? the trace of his being . In all times , as in our times , the domination of the world has stood the enemy of the artist ? the one who would live . The demand to pass juries , to make the acceptable , the salable , fighting of the wolf from the door , obtaining of medals for the weight they have in waging the social war ;  | all these things , certain and terrible in their exactions , have held the slave with his eye on the by-product , and the by-product has suffered , for the by-product can not produce itself . Things being as they are , the life of an artist is a battle wherein great economy must be exercised . The kind of economy which will result in moments of the purest freedom in spite of the world 's exactions . If one is a painter this purest freedom must exist at the time of painting . This is as much as to say that a painter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a painter but must make it some other way . This is generally true , although some do , by a freak of appreciation , make enough while going their way to live sufficiently well . Perhaps this happens , but I am not sure but that there is some curtailing of the purity of the freedom . I was once asked by a young artist whether he could hope to make any money out of his work if he continued in his particular style of painting . He happened to be a man of considerable talent and had great enthusiasm in his work . But I knew there was no public enthusiasm for such work . I remembered he had told me that before he got really into art he had made a living by designing labels for cans , tomato cans and the like . I advised him to make tomato-can labels and live well that he might be free to paint as he liked . It happened also that eventually people did buy his early pictures , although he was as far from pleasing by what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now lived on the sale of his old pictures and was as free to paint his new ones as he had been in the days of tomato cans . What is past in this letter is the most important part of my advice to you in regard to your work . What follows probably will be more technical . A fault I find is a lack of solidity . By solidity I mean the employment of bulk as a factor of expression . Forms interacting with forms . The weight and density of the sea . The bulk and hard resistance of rock . The cavern of the sky . A blouse with a body in it . A head with a back to it . Bulk is only one of the factors of expression , but it is a mighty force . Putting form against form , color against color , line against line , movement against movement , texture against texture and showing their interaction , showing through them the force which binds them , is the way of good painting and drawing . It 's a question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is the recipe ? It is a matter of conception . If in your state you have the sense of it , in your work you will have the will for it . Whoever cares most for the body which the blouse screens from the eyes will paint the body in painting the blouse , for in the state one sees through . In like fashion the wrinkles and folds will become signs of movement , not only of a blouse but of the life one senses in the individual . Very technically speaking , thicker paint , a fearlessness in painting over and not being afraid of spoiling in so  | doing , may oe conducive to a development of more solidity , just as a larger brush will sometimes induce a broader treatment . There is some consideration of the nature of the materials you use in these statements , and there is the value of suggestion in them . But whatever dodge you try , what you will succeed in suggesting is only what you have actually conceived . Of the three beach pictures , I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lilt of the gulls and the rhythm of movement in the gulls collectively . Solidity as I have described it would add much to the work . I may say that the compositions are rather the expected . In this regard I will refer to that rare quality of the unexpected in Chinese paintings . Also will remark that solidity does not require thickness of paint . A Chinese painting is almost invariably solid . A Sung drawing , though it may be but lines , very solid . The artist sensed form highly ? got in his lines what he sensed because nothing else would satisfy him . In the calm beach ; red rock a good note , sea a bit attenuated , horizon line monotonous , ordinary , not richly expressive of what it means . This line is so important in the composition that it must be strong in interest . There must not be weakness of foreground . The eye is expected to pass over it because it must feel to be there , solid , and not attenuated . Foregrounds being generally out of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The small canvas ? feeling that it is wind-swept , good . But here meagre foreground . Three textures ? sky , sea , sand . We consider red , yellow and blue-green a good chord in color if they are  | well differentiated . Sea , sky , sand are a good chord of textures if well differentiated . The head . A background is a certain color , but see a head before it and the background color changes . A head makes its own background . Movements in background must grow out of head . We come to see only what relates . In your backgrounds I see paint-brush strokes , not forms related to head . Study massing of heads by masters . Dignity of each mass in relation with others . Every shape on a Velasquez head is a grand thing and every shape pays a compliment to the other shapes , an organization of great units . Note how few changes of direction in great drawing . Economy . When change occurs , it counts . Where is the dominant light ? See how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterno-mastoid sags , has not the grand gesture of youth and delicacy . Notwithstanding all these criticisms you have heart for the work . You love the things . You have a heart feeling for the girl , and a respect . Forget about the exhibitions and the juries . Think less of the success of the by-product and you will have more success with it . Keep living . And that means keep on painting . It is not easy to know what you like . Most people fool themselves their entire lives through about this . Self acquaintance is a rare condition .  | There are men who , at the bottom of the ladder battle to rise ; they study , struggle , keep their wits alive and eventually get up to a place where they are received as an equal among respectable intellectuals . Here they find warmth and comfort for their pride , and here the struggle ends , and a death of many years commences . They could have gone on living . Paint like a fiend when the idea possesses you . The tramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all huddled up . His body is thick . His underlip hangs . His eyes look fierce . I feel the coarseness of his clothes against his bare legs . He is not beautiful , but he could well be the motive for a great and beautiful work of art . The subject can be as it may , beautiful or ugly . The beauty of a work of art is in the work itself . Use the ability you already have , and use it , and use it , and make it develop itself . Do n't just pay your tuition and drift along with the current of the school . Do n't just fall in with the procession . Many receive a criticism and think it is fine ; think they got their money 's worth ; think well of the teacher for it ,  | and then go on with their work just the same as before . That is the reason much of the wisdom of Plato is still locked up in the pages of Plato . Make compositions . Use the knowledge you acquire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as much as a dog likes to gnaw a bone and go at it with equal interest and exclusion of everything else . It is n't so much that you say the truth as that you say an important truth . Gesture and music are alike in that they have powers of extension beyond known measurements . In looking at a great piece of sculpture ? the Sphinx , we may be impressed by a sense of time . The sculptor seems to have dealt in great measures , not the ordinary ones . I believe that some such impression as this is received by most of those who contemplate the Sphinx , that it certainly does convey something outside its material self , something in very great measure . There is a peculiar feeling of awe in its presence . In viewing the Greek sculptures there is a similar sense . The measures in the modeling are not casual external measures , but seem to be such as to convey a sense of the life within . External measures have been used therefore by the artist in their analogous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may explain the great difference in impression we receive from works of different periods in art history and also the differences we feel in one artist 's work from another in spite of the fact that they may be equals in matters of skill . In some works , marvelous though they may be , the spirit of the observer seems to be caged within the measures employed , and in other works , more marvelous , the spirit seems to be liberated into a field of other and greater measures . In the first type of work we find ourselves caught and held in fascinating intricacies . In the second we find cause to take departure and enter into a condition of new and yet very personal states of consciousness . One catches us and shows us its marvels . The other is incentive to a personal voyage of discovery . The first type can eventu-ally be exhausted . The second can remain as a perpetual incentive to new flights . The men of action in the world have fixed their interests in different ways at different times , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The marvels of external beauty for one and the marvels of the internal life for the other , and in painting and sculpture the means of expression is in either case external appearances . But such different uses must they make of external appearances ! It is a finding of signs . We realize that there is no one way of seeing a thing no matter how simple that thing may be . Its planes , values , colors , all its characteristics are , as it were , shuffled before each new-comer arrives , and it is up to him to arrange them according to his understanding . se  | Once when I was a young student I heard another student spoken of as " one who saw color beautifully . " I was very much impressed by this . So one has not only to see color but he must see it beautifully , meaningly , constructively ! ? as a factor in the making of something , a concept , something in his consciousness , something that is not exactly that thing before him which the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . All kinds of seeing . Dead seeing . Live seeing . Things that are mere surfaces . Things that are filled with the wondrous . Yes , color must be seen beautifully , that is , meaningfully , and used as a constructive agent , borrowed from nature , not copied , and used to build , used only for its building power , lest it will not be beautiful . It is very hard to see this aspect , our aspect , of the thing before us . It is very hard because it is the simplest thing we do . If you could catch yourself while on some ramble in the woods and know the source of your happiness , and continuing the same kind of seeing , proceed to paint , the work you would do would be eventually a revelation to you . Eventually , I say , for at first it would shock you , so different would it be from that convention which has enslaved you . It would be your original output . The easiest thing is the hardest . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Schools of new vision rise and fall . The type of that man who said he could n't see shadows purple but hoped soon to do so , is yet our average type . - We are not yet developed to the plane where there are many who would pit their own originality against the fashion of the day .  | It is , however , to the artist or to the scientist ? there are times when the distinction disappears ? that we look for that freedom which will return us to simple understanding . Our future freedom rests in the hands of those whose likeness will be in their dissimilarity , and who will not be ashamed of their own originality , whatever the fashion may happen to be . To answer , to the best of one 's ability , the questions of a child is fine teaching . This is as beneficial to the teacher as it is to the child . If the question finds the teacher unprepared he is stimulated to research on the point in question . Many of these questions though apparently trivial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The teacher participates in the study and becomes a student along with the child . We are all different ; we are to do different things and see different life . Education is a self-product , a matter of asking questions and getting the best answers we can get . We read a book , a novel , any book , we are interested in it to the degree we find in it answers to our questions . When the teacher is continually author both of the question and its answer , it is not as likely the answer will sink deep and get into service , as it will if the question is asked by the child . Both methods properly used have their value , but one is much better than the other .  | The special knowledge needed by one may not be much needed by another . I am particularly glad to hear that you have been painting from memory . I am quite certain your best work will come from dealing with the memories which have stuck after what is unessential to you in experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures , even painted in the presence of the subject , this thing did happen . I know one beautiful street scene you sent to the exhibition that I have always felt was done in a trance of memories undisturbed by the material presences ( that is if you did do it out of doors and with the street before you ) . Especially in painting brilliant sunlight , working outdoors is difficult , for it takes a long time to get eyes accustomed to the difference between light and pigment so that anything like a translation can be made . In fact I think most pictures of the Southwest are to a great extent false because the painters get blinded into whiteness , make pale pictures where the real color of New Mexico is deep and strong . Anyhow , all work that is worth while has got to be memory work . Even with a model before you in the quiet light of a studio there must come a time when you have what you want to know from the model , when the model had better be sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this does come , it is not likely the work will get below the surface .  | From a Letter There is great beauty in your penmanship . The flow of it . It is just such apparently unimportant tendencies toward expression of something that runs deep in one , which make drawing beautiful or otherwise . It seems to have been Rembrandt 's very spirit which pushed the inked stick around for him , while many another appears to have been moved by intellect alone . One of the attractions of Renoir is that at times his paint seems to have a flow , one color into and through another . One thinks of the elegance of mind that was back of the line . We seem to know the very spirit of Giotto . And the form of Manet ! A beautiful dignity always in Velasquez ! It would be easy to divide artists into two classes : those who grow so much within themselves as to master technique by the force of their need , and those who are mastered by technique and become stylists . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and know the miracle when it happens . And I can think of no more real life than the adventurous one of living and liking and exclaiming the things of one 's own time . Letter of Criticism I see in the sketches a very personal outlook , an interest in the beautiful design of nature , a decided sensitiveness to  | the orchestration of color , good sense of form and the compositional possibilities of form . All this I see so that the principal response I have to make is " go on . " Going on will mean a continual attack with ever the will to get the fullest conclusion , to make every work as complete as possible . By " complete " I do not mean any conventional finish , but I do mean a complete statement of just what you feel most important to say about the subject . A work of art is not a copy of things . It is inspired by nature but must not be a copying of the surface . Therefore what is commonly called " finish " may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement of what is essential to you ? an innate reality , not a surface reality . You handle surface appearances as compositional factors to express a reality that is beyond superficial appearances . You choose things seen and use them to phrase your statement . When I opened the package and set out the five panels , I had a decided satisfaction in them . The sense of beauty was refreshing . No. 3 caught me first . No. 4 seems not to have the fine areas , weights , measures , variety , balance of the one thing against another as in No. 3 , where the measures are excellent , giving those qualities called distance and atmosphere . I find the white house a bit big for the other forms of the composition , big to be so empty . The incidents of door , windows , fence , roof and chimney do not seem sufficient to take away from the baldness of this large and prominent area of the house .  | With an area so large and prominent , which attracts so much , there should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be produced in many ways . Variation in color , in light and dark , etc . The green tree to right is to me the finest incident in the composition . This has life . One does not stop in seeing it . There is an engaging variation . In sound there may be monotony ? one note prolonged to infinity . There may be variety . Variety may be a devilish jangle . Variety may be such as to produce a popular air , . Variety may be such as Beethoven employed . Good composition in painting is equally a fine employinent of measures . Compare your painting of the things of No. 4 with those of No. 3 . Does not each thing look more precious in No. 3 ? Compare white house with white house , window with window , incidental stave , stick or other interruption with each other . You will find them all functioning , alive , interesting in No. 3 . It is only in that tree in No. 4 that one feels an equal life . The why of this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are parts of a whole . Each thing benefits the whole , its neighbor , all its neighbors , and is receiving benefit from all of them . This is the principle of order . Each thing is more than itself alone . In the great compositions of sound , the notes have a power beyond what we might have hoped for them . They enrich their surroundings and are enriched by their rich surroundings .  | In the efforts to accomplish composition there are many rules and schemes established , some of them good and some of them bad . But one thing I am certain of , and that is that intense comprehension and intense desire to express one whole thing is necessary . Without a positive purpose , means effect only an exercise in means . You ca n't know too much about composition . That is ; the areas you have to fill , their possibilities , but you must , above all , preserve your intense interest in life . You must have the will to say a very definite thing . Then , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different meaning to the words things and forms . I once had a pupil whom I considered an artist , and he was an artist despite the fact that he never drew the model in even reasonable anatomical proportion . This was too bad , but the proportions of the forms in their areas on the canvas , the proportions and " steps " made in his colors , values , lines , were beautiful . He was remarkable in expressing with what might be called form proportions , and not at all good in expressing with thing proportions . You have surely a sense of beauty and romance in reality . You do not have to soften and sweeten nature to make it beautiful . You are plainly not of the sort who think a work of art or a thing beautiful must be a cheat . You like nature , do not feel that you have to apologize for it , and you believe in its integrity , you like integrity . You think nature is all right , that there are endless , inexhaustible pleasures , and revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting frankly acquainted with , and that  | it is worth while trying to tell about the deepest intimacies of this acquaintance , to tell in paint , or in any other way , in fact . Your work tells me this much , because perhaps 1 am looking for it , anxiously expecting and desiring it in all work , and because I am used to pictures . That 's the reason I say " go on . " I do not say " go differently . " You have to go on satisfying yourself more and more in order that others less keen to see and less used to reading pictures will get the song you sing . Your only hope of satisfying others is in satisfying yourself . I speak of a great satisfaction , not a commercial satisfaction . There are people who buy pictures because they were difficult to do , and are done . Such pictures are often only a record of pain and dull perseverance . Great works of art should look as though they were made in joy . Real joy is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The drudgery that kills is not half the work that joy is . Your education must be self-education . Self-education is an effort to free one 's course so that a full growth may be attained . One need not be afraid of what this full growth may become . Give your throat a chance to sing its song . All the knowledge in the world to which you have access is yours to use . Give yourself plenty of canvas room , plenty of paint room . Do n't bother about your originality , set yourself just as free as you can and your originality will take care of youy It will be as much a surprise to you as to anyone else . Originality can not be preconceived , and any effort to coddle it is to preconceive it , and thereby destroy it . Learn all you can , get all the information that is within your reach about the ways and means of paint . The best advice I have ever given to students who have  | studied under me has been just this : " Educate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , do not be used by me . " What I would say is that you should watch your work mighty well and see that it is the voice that comes from within you that speaks in your work ? not an expected or controlled voice , not an outside educated voice . In the No. 2 there is beauty of open space , an expression in the temperature . There 's a good over-all state of being in that landscape , and then that fence is beautiful in its color , it progresses . You need not know a thousand tricks performed by others , you need not have a great stock of tricks of your own making . With a great will to say a thing comes clairvoyance . The more positively you have the need of a certain expression the more power you will have to select out of chaos the term of that expression . Your sense of color I am sure of . I think you see color in beautiful order in nature . You see color in construction . Some people only see color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between colors . Some eyes see how lines go over a shoulder and over a hip , can copy them and ' make an indisputably honest statement of them ; another eye may see the relation between them , will recognize them as powers in a great scheme . I think you can have a wonderful time . It is really a wonderful time I am wishing you . Art is , after all , only a trace ? like a footprint which shows that one has walked bravely and in great happiness . Those who live in full play of their faculties become master economists , they understand the relative value of things . Freedom can only be obtained through an understanding of basic order .  | Basic order is underlying all life . It is not to be found in the institutions men have made . Those who have lived and grown at least to some degree in the spirit of freedom are our creative artists . They have a wonderful time . They keep the world going . They must leave their trace in some way , paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they do is greater than anyone estimates at the time . In fact in a commercial world there are thousands of lives wasted doing things not worth doing . Human spirit is sacrificed . More and more things are produced without a will in the creation , and are consumed or " used " without a will in the consumption or the using . These things are dead . They pass , masquerading as important while they are before us , but they pass utterly . There is nothing so important as art in the world , nothing so constructive , so life-sustaining . I would like you to go to your work with a consciousness that it is more important than any other thing you might do . It may have no great commercial value , but it has an inestimable and lasting life value . People are often so affected by outside opinion that they go to their most important work half hearted or half ashamed . " What 's the use of it if you are not making money out of it ? " is a too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are raised the moment he does happen to make money out of them ! Very false values . I say this and I know as well as any the difficulties of making sufficient money and the necessity of making it in order to live and go on . Go to your work because it is the most important living to you . Make great things ? as great as you are . Work  | always as if you were a master , expect from yourself a masterpiece . It 's a wrong idea that a master is a finished person . Masters are very faulty , they have n't learned everything and they know it . Finished persons are very common ? people who are closed up , quite satisfied that there is little or nothing more to learn . A small boy can be a master . I have met masters now and again , some in studios , others anywhere , working on a railroad , running a boat , playing a game , selling things . Masters of such as they had . They are wonderful people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence " when with a carpenter or a gardener ? When they are the right kind they do not say " I am only a carpenter or a gardener , therefore not much can be expected from me . " They say or they seem to say , " I am a Carpenter ; " " I am a Gardener ! " These are masters , what more could anyone be ! I like your work and have only to ask you to go on your own interesting way with all the courage you can muster . Keep as far as possible all your studies , all your failures , if somewhere in them appear any desirable qualities . Such canvases are good for reference . Later study of the work recalls the good of it . Sometimes an old unfinished canvas will serve as a recall from lesser and unimportant wanderings . You can learn much from others but more from yourself . In looking at an incomplete canvas some time after its doing , the whole thing becomes clear , the tangle dis-  | solves , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be avoided . Do n't be ashamed to keep your bad stuff . After all you did it . It is your history and worth studying . Shame makes a small man give up a lot of time smearing over and covering up his rough edges . There is a wonderful work of art by Leonardo da Vinci , one of his most interesting . It is quite unfinished , yet perhaps it is one of his most finished , gets us in deeper . No work of art is really ever finished . They only stop at good places . Shame is one of the worst things that ever happened to us . There is weakness in pretending to know more than you know or in stating less than you know . Technique must be solid , positive , but elastic , must not fall into formula , must adapt itself to the idea . And for each new idea there must be new invention special to the expression of that idea and no other . And the idea must be valuable , worth the effort of expression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be a thing he greatly desires to say . Artists must be men of wit , consciously or unconsciously philosophers , read , study , think a great deal of life , be filled with the desire to declare and specify their particular and most personal interest in its manifestations , and must invent .  | Exhibitions will never attract crowds or create any profound interest until there is in the works exposed evidence of a greater interest in the life we live . Letter of Criticism The most important thing I can say to you is that your work shows the artist temperament ; the tendency to produce impressions of life , as you find it fascinating , through the mediums of drawing and color . All your things suggest action , or , better still , the state of mind which is the cause of action . You have the gift of color . Look at Japanese prints . You will see in them these gifts developed to completion . The color is benefited by the form . The form is benefited by the color . They balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet they are as fast as one could desire them to be . They are impressions of nature , often similar to yours . But they fill and satisfy . They have the sense of full completion . The Japanese artist had no hurry to get away from the work lest it go wrong . He faced it out , and won out . I would not have your drawings take on the conventions , but I would have them acquire the solid integrity , the certainty , of the Japanese prints . Your Children with the Balloons ( No. 1 ) is beautiful in color , in child action . The balloons appear to have been painted through the wondering eyes of the child . The balloons are as admirable as the child saw them .  | Should they have more completion ? I believe that it is not in the balloons themselves that further completion should be sought , but it should be in establishing a finer relation in all the parts of the composition to the space of the whole . Probably it would be good to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the field of your expression . A fine adjustment must be made within its limits . Your ideas must not wander , anywhere , within the confines of the canvas , but they must fill it completely . A space may be left bare , but that bare space must become meaningful . It is a part of the structure nevertheless . In the picture of the Two Women in the Rain ( No. 2 ) there is the look and the feel of a shower pouring down beautifully . The lines with which you have indicated the rain appear to have an easy haphazard look . But they can not be haphazard for they have a fine rhythm and they do make me follow you into the spirit of rain . They have the science of design in them and the science is , as it should be , beautifully covered . The Portly Lady ( No. 3 ) with the market basket has the fascinations of Renoir color , and the humor of her shows your kindly spirit . This may be said of practically all your figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nature the thing which charms you , and to express just that as fully and completely as you can . Just that . Nothing else . Not to do as any other artist does . Nor to be afraid that you may do as any other artist does .  | Do not require of your work the finish that anyone may demand of you , but insist on the finish which you demand . When the thing suits you it is right . Your greatest masterpiece may be even more slight than any of these things you have shown . Even more sketchy . But the order in the slight material you will use will be so positive , so certain and all comprehending that the fullest sense of your idea will be conveyed and it will be complete . The most beautiful art is the art which is freest from the demands of convention , which has a law to itself , which as technique is a creation of a special need . The demand we so often hear for finish is not for finish , but is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of Bouguereau the Manet has not been finished . Judging a Bouguereau from the point of view of Manet the Bouguereau has not been begun . I have just placed six more of your pictures before me . One need not bother you talking of color . You need but to command your medium and your sense and pleasure in color will do the rest . With an actual command of the medium , which you must work for , you will make beautiful things . In No. 4 the white is exquisite . But the seated figure is an ogre from lack of sustained intention . No. 6 . Beautiful in color and gesture and space relation of the figures . No. 6 . Again the beautiful relation of figures . They are in charming sympathy with each other . No. 7 . Interesting for the strident action and color . No. 8 . An excellent thing . Except that the table rests uneasily on its legs this canvas has the quality of relation-  | ship within its confines that gives to the whole a real integrity . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has that largeness which we admire in the lithographs of Daumier . No. 9 . Altar boys . The allegro and the pomp . Such an excellent boy to our side of the priest . What fine work you can do in this vein when your grip is stronger , when you can go the step of greater assurance . It will do well for you to look at Daumier 's lithographs . His fancy is free . His statement is assured . In the color of your No. 10 one imagines the voices in the air . No. 11 . A beautiful background . No.12 . Charming color . Had you more security in your idea of the figures , which would have made you draw them hardly different , yet with more positiveness , this would be a splendid composition . No. 13 . Again the color , air , space , gesture of woman 's head . Too bad she has such short fat legs ; and that the ground is not substantial . By substantial I do not mean heavier , darker , nor this nor that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which a woman walks , your feeling would have dictated the means of its substantiality . Your drawings also show the artist in you . You are interested . You have art . What you say is as though it came from you . It is a personal interest of your own and it interests me . You have a big line . It often gets cramped , but the big line is there and it can grow .  | Daumier and the Japanese prints can be a good influence on you because you need not do like them . I have just noticed the backs of two little girls walking away . But there are so many I might notice . A woman in red with another at her side . Little children walking parade . , Children at a door . Fat party in cab . Groups of people . Foot bath . Sweepers . Fashions . People drooping in the rain . Women and children . And so forth , and so forth . All interesting matters of wit . My best use to you is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you is to go on telling us what you like , giving us your delight in it all . It is the way the best artists have made themselves . In going over these slight works of yours I have had a great pleasure . They might have been much heavier without having as much weight and I might not have had any pleasure at all . Letter of Criticism It is the conception which dictates the form and the color . The world and life are common , every day , and almost empty to a great many people , but there are those who see that the world and life are mysteriously wonderful . There is a latent possibility of specific and penetrating vision in each individual . The thing is to develop this possibility . The artists who count develop their vision , and the results , since each one is different from the other , are surprising and important .  | I would call your attention to the reproductions of those children 's heads done by Renoir . They are easily obtainable and they are very beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such work Renoir must have been charged with a high estimate and a great reverence for the child , an unsentimental but a just appreciation of the wonder before him ; and he must have been so charged at the very moment of the execution , for thus his hand was guided to a magic that makes his interpretation so wonderful . In suggesting the works of masters , I do not mean that pictures like their pictures should be made , or that motives like their motives should be repeated . But I point rather to the principles which underly their work . The principles of developed judgment , power of essay , power of intense feeling , intense respect . Rembrandt 's beggars are wonders of life . He did not pass them on to us saying simply , " They are vulgar fellows . " Besides this principle of motives , there is the principle of construction . The construction with paint on flat canvas of colors and forms , for the expression of ideas . The mastery of these mediums , understanding of limitations and possibilities within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . And these two ; the motive and the means must be so brought together , so enacted at the same time , that their action is as one .  | It will not do to have your fine thought yesterday , and paint your picture today . I advise the study of the works of the masters . Titian is a good one , for he understood organization , as his works demonstrate , and he happens to be available in many reproductions . Observe his compositions of figures and his portraits of men and women . See how much use he makes of balances and rhythms . Study these things well . Look for the way the pictures are laced and bound together by their lines , how they flow in currents which control your sight and your interest . See the masses of light so held in size in spite of detail , and the masses of dark , all of such weights and such measures that there is fullness , sufficiency . Good painting is a result of effort to obtain order , and the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus serene dignity , static repose , vitality , action , variety , and the various states of life can be suggested . The exclusion of the trivial must be effected . I am not considering so much either the merits or demerits of your present work . I am trying to say things that will be useful to you just as though I were saying them to myself ? for they would , and I hope will , be useful to me . In the faces painted by Greco we get something of what was real ? what happened in Greco . Novels are sometimes more historical than histories .  | We read books . They make us think . It matters very little whether we agree with the books or not . Ibsen clearly identifies his characters . These characters , however , are merely his materials . It is not Hedda Gabler he introduces to us . It is a state of life and questions as to the future of the race . Today we do.not know how much we owe to Shakespeare . His work is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced by him . Life is permeated with the thoughts of Plato , with the thoughts of all great artists who have lived . If you are to make great art it will be because you have become a deep thinker . Nature is sometimes seen through very obscure evidences . It is a big job to know oneself , no one can entirely accomplish it yet ? but to try is to act in line of evolution . Men will come to know more of themselves , and act more like themselves , but this will be by dint of effort along the line of humble self acknowledgment . Today man stands in his own way . He puts a criterion in the way of his own revelation and development . He would be better than he is and because man judges poorly he fails to become as good as he might be . He should take his restraining hands off himself , should defy fashion and let himself be . The only men who are interesting to themselves and to others are  | those who have been willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they are because they are evidences from men who dared to be like themselves . It cost most of them dearly , but it was worth while . They were interesting to themselves , and now they are interesting to us . Letter from New Mexico Here in the pueblos of New Mexico the Indians still make beautiful pottery and rugs , works which are mysterious and at the same time revealing of some great life principle which the old race had . Although some hands lead , the whole pueblo seems responsible for the work and stands for their communal greatness . It represents them , reveals a certain spirituality we would like to comprehend , explains to a degree that distinction which we recognize in their bearing . Materially they are a crushed out race , but even in the remnant there is a bright spark of spiritual life which we others with all our goods and material protections can envy . They have art as a part of each one 's life . The whole pueblo manifests itself in a piece of pottery . With us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does not paint does not feel himself an artist . We allot to some the gift of genius ; to all the rest , practical business . Undoubtedly in the ancient Indian race , genius was the possession of all ; the reality of their lives . The superior ones among them made the greater manifestations , but each manifested , lived and expressed his life according to  | his strength ; was a spiritual existence , a genius , an artist to his fullest extent . Apart from that , they raised crops , covered themselves , attended to the material according to their understanding , and wandered of course afar into that dark life outside the artist life , into war and strife , and all the fruits of material greed ? like ourselves . Behind them they have left some records of both existences , but we cherish most those which tell of a certain spiritual well-being , the warm heart in love with life and working with a love of work which is the song of their well-being . In America , or in any country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of canvases in palatial museums , by the purchase and bodily owning of art . - The greatness can only come by the art spirit entering into the very life of the people , not as a thing apart , but as the greatest essential of life to each one . It is to make every life productive of light ? a spiritual influence . It is to enter government and the whole material existence as the essential influence , and it alone will keep government straight , end wars and strife ; do away with material greed . When America is an art country , there will not be three or five or seven arts , but there will be the thousands of arts ? or the one art , the art of life manifesting itself in every work of man , be it painting or whatever . We will then have to give in kind for what we get . And every man will be a true enrichment to the other . Any step toward such an end is a step toward human happiness , a sane and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There will be failures as well as sue-  | cesses , but if the strong desire exists both conditions will serve as experience in progress . Gesture , the most ancient form of expression ? of communication between living creatures . A language we have almost lost . Its infinite possibilities of expression . To recapture gesture as a means of expression would mean not only added powers of communication but would mean also a greater health and strength . In great cities public art galleries are generally put in out-of-the-way places ? remote from most of the people . A visit requires an elaborate effort and more time in going and coming than people can spare . Having an idea of the educational influence of art , I would like to see many small well-organized art galleries scattered over a city , furnishing easy access to each community ? whatever that community might happen to be , rich , poor , business or residential . In the same spirit I favor the Little Theatre movement , and I would like to see places in every neighborhood for good music by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be spread over all the community . This of course could not be done so long as the only will comes from the box office .  | As to the art galleries , what I am thinking of particularly is rotary exhibitions of the best works owned by the great central museum . In this way a series of very fine collections would be kept in motion going to the people . Anyone can see the pleasure and the benefit these exhibitions would give , how they would be frequented in spare hours by those who rarely have more than an hour 's freedom at any one time . The existence of these small neighborhood galleries would in no way deflect from the importance or the usefulness of the big museum ? in fact they would be a great help . If you have the idea that an artist is not a decidedly practical person , get over it . Do n't think that Frans Hals was drunk when he painted his vital pictures . Let the romancing historian think so , but just look at one of his heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were necessary to place those solid forms in action and to render so much completion with such simple strokes . Wonderful judgment in the conception and execution of these works . A great order in them . The whole thing an invention . No copying . He must have had a fine working mind and he must have used it as its master . I 'll bet his tools were the best , and everything in the right condition , and the right place , for immediate use . One man , all distinguished bearing , another fat and soft , with a ribald joke on his lip , one made of iron , and by his side a dandy .  | Frans Hals liked them all for what they were and he gave his best to each one . Every bit of Frans Hals ' painting is sheer invention . Examine the structure in the strokes which make the heads . They are parts of mighty buildings . Look at a mere tassel on a boot or a sword hilt , you will find it a marvelous composition . Frans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and people in his own peculiar way and he was a supreme master of the tools in his hands . I believe that keeping one 's faculties in full exercise is the secret of good health and longevity . It made Titian a young man at nearly a hundred . Perhaps mental inactivity is the most fatiguing thing in the world . It is a common thing for business men to die soon after they retire . That is , if they do not take up some new enterprise in life . There are cases of actual rejuvenation as a result of new enterprise more interesting than that which preceded . Critical judgment of a picture is often given without a moment 's hesitation . I have seen a whole gallery of pictures condemned with a sweep of the eye . I remember hearing a prominent artist on entering a gallery declare " My eight-year-old child could do better than this . " The subject of the charge was a collection of modern pictures with which the artist was not familiar . There were pie-  | tures by Matisse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great students along a different line . The works , whatever anyone might think of them , were the results of years of study . The " critical judgment " of them was accomplished in a sweep of the eye . All kinds of critics , professional , artist , student and lay-critics are prone to bring with them their preconceived ideas . Many of them are outraged if they do not find what they expect . Such people want peace ? they want no new sensations , and they want nothing that is hard to get . The critical spirit which is yet to develop will invite difficulties , will wish to be disturbed into re-valuations . New works will inspire to further energy . I have seen a picture judged , acknowledged as good , and bought by a man without turning a hair . He bought it really because it did not give him a kick . It was a further proof that what he already knew was sufficient . He bought it to dam the stream of his own development . There is an idea in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whereas the appreciation of art is a very personal and special response to creative work . And it must be a part of the province of the artist so to present his work as to help create this response . The grip of a line . Note how a line takes hold .  | It hooks the vital parts together . It binds the composition . Look well at the model and look well at the drawings of masters and you will see why I speak of the hook of a line , which grips . See the drawings of Rembrandt , the Chinese and the Japanese masters . There is a portrait in the Louvre which has a great abrasion on the face , but somehow the abrasion does not spoil the work . It is there but it does not count . The picture is the work of Tintoretto ? a great master . His organization of forms is so powerful that it carries through the obliterated place . When you make figures in composition you may discover that you do not know the figure . Students work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for life studies and find in the end that they know practically nothing of the human figure . They have acquired the ability to copy . It is the common defect of modern art study . Too many students do not know why they draw . If you are studying art and not making compositions , my advice is to begin immediately . You study from the model mainly to get experience . Your composition is the expression of your interests and in making your compositions you apply what you learn when working from the model . Your object in painting from the model is not to  | become a painter of school studies , but to become a painter of whatever you have to express with figures , portraits , landscapes , street scenes , anything , in fact , that interests you . Letter of Criticism Drawing , disconcerted , going at random , now after one idea , now after another . Good drawing comes of a concerted movement , the selection of certain things , and the specifying of them with an end in view . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas must work . Features or parts of features , or accessories , all must be treated as factors in a general movement . However interesting they may be in themselves , in a painting they are parts of a sequence more important than themselves . Throughout the whole canvas you should think of the effect of the big masses of color in their relation to each other . In a good canvas these big masses work together , have constructive effect on one another , just as in music . In well composed music you ca n't get away from the motive . A hundred artists might work with you from that same subject , The Girl and the Goldfish , and assuming them all to be good artists , each one of them because of his motive would render the nose , the neck , the fish , all the parts , all i. the colors and all the values in different ways , some eliminating where others accentuate , and all the pictures , although different , would look like the model , all of them beautiful because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to their constructive value .  | Now to deal with the work from another viewpoint and give you further criticism I will say that my impression of your two paintings made me feel that in doing them you were trying to fit yourself into a kind of work , done to your admiration by another artist , but quite outside your power of concept . I think your only salvation is in finding yourself , and you will never find yourself unless you quit preconceiving what you will be when you have found yourself . What , after all , are your greatest , deepest , and all-possessing interests ? Most people seem to think they are great enough to know beforehand , and what generally results is that they imprison themselves in some sort of Girl and Goldfish subject , which , as I say , they may admire from the hand of another but for which they have no personal vocation . Those who are so imprisoned work like prisoners . You can see where the heart is out of it . Pictures tell the story of actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What you need is to free yourself from your own preconceived ideas about yourself . It will take a revolution to do it , and many times you will think yourself on the road only to find that the old habit has possessed you again with a new preconception . But if you can at least to a degree free yourself , take your head off your heart and give the latter a chance , something may come of it . The results will not be what you expect , but they will be like you and will be the best that can come from you . And there will be a lot more pleasure in the doing . Now these are only my opinions , I do not say they are final , nor do I say they are right , but they are my opinions .  | You have asked ' for them , and at any rate they are kinder to you than they are harsh to the two pictures . You are often told that your painting is " very good ? as far as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You proceed to " carry it further , " and find yourself carrying it backward . The trouble is most likely that you have added things to it where what was needed was a coordination of what had already been set down . Some people study hard for a time , then they " graduate " and sink back into the little they have learned . There are many kinds of study . Those whose study is of the real and rare kind get the habit . They ca n't throw it off . It 's too good . They go on studying all their lives , and they have wonderful lives . It is not desirable to devote all your time to an appreciation of art . Art should drive you forth . It should be an incentive to life . The greatest value of art to the appreciator is in that it stimulates to personal activity . When you have made a sketch , close your box ? walk away ? then open your box . Maybe you will see that you  | have deflected from your original idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the beginning ? a vital impulse has been lost ? go back and go after that first seizing idea ? and refuse to be mastered by material things . It is a mistake to think that spirituality is seen only through a mist . There are some painters who deal with the play of light as the most graceful thing that exists . What does a man see when he goes to the Indian Dance ? What are all these impressions ? I have gone to many , had a perfectly delightful time , and then later hearing others talking of what they had seen , have found that from their point of view I had missed everything of importance . I have gone again and have struggled to see the " right " things . In doing so I have felt quite educational , but I have not had any happiness . The effort has prevented me from seeing what are my things in the dance . But what does a man see when he sees his own things ? A few have found out ? somewhat . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be a mighty interesting accounting of externals . It must be strong in its kind . It would be a big job really to paint the Snake Dance . I have never seen it , but of course with  | my knowledge of other Indian dances , I have a ground to base imagination on . I know that I would see a vast country , an immense sky , great space . In this great space there would be the mesa , the pueblo , the little crowd of spectators , and then the dancers with rattlesnakes in their mouths . Something happening way off there , a little speck on the face of the earth . But how would I see it ? Would it not be a reversal of all these proportions ; the smallest become the largest . I can believe that the tiny little snakes would so enlarge upon me that I would be filled with an . overpowering sense of their writhing strength , their quick and slow movements , strike and poison . They would dominate the sky and the mountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be the Snake Dance filling the universe . Isadora Duncan dances and fills the universe . She exceeds all ordinary measure . The difficulty for us is to know what , or how we see material things , when we are seeing beyond material things . If we could only know what we see , and paint what we see ! I am glad to hear that you propose to take the bit in your teeth and buck for freedom . There is little use in painting ? in living in fact ? unless you let yourself grow your natural course . You will have a wonderful time . Others ( those who wish to dictate ) will not be satisfied perhaps ? but they are never satisfied anyway ? and you will give them better than they know . At any rate what you will give will be news  | from your country . The big men have been rare simply because most men heed dictators . Nobody wanted Walt Whitman , but Walt Whitman wanted himself , and it is well for us that he did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . Because of our education we continually get off our track , but the fight is a good one and there is joy in it if there is any success at all . After all , the goal is not making art . It is living a life . Those who live their lives will leave the stuff that is really art . Art is a result . It is the trace of those who have led their lives . It is interesting to us because we read the struggle and the degree of success the man made in his struggle to live . The great question is : " What is worth while ? " The majority of people have failed to ask themselves seriously enough , and have failed to try seriously enough to answer this question . Life is being wasted . The human family is not having half the fun that is its due , not making the beautiful things it would make , and each one is not as good news to the other as he might be , just because we are educated off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great revolution in the world which is to equalize opportunity , bring peace and freedom , must be a spiritual revolution . A new will must come . This will is a very personal thing in each one . Our education has led away from the realization that the mystery of nature is in each man . When we are wiser we will not assume to mould ourselves , but will make our ignorance stand aside ? hands off ? and we will watch our own development . We will learn from ourselves . This habit of conducting nature is a bad one .  | If those who work in both pastels and oils could get a bit of the quality of the one into the other a good thing would happen . For instance , here is a pastel all gay and pale in its pastel lightness and there an oil deep in oily sogginess . The pastel would benefit by a deeper note and a textural unity of surface and the oil might come up out of the gloom into which you have let it sink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not lighter or more luminous simply because you did not will strong enough to have it so . In too many cases pastel stays pale because it wants to be pale . Oil becomes dark and muddy because it is easy for it to sink into depths , and the artist is victim , not master . Letter of Criticism General effect ? Far the best works I have seen of yours . Throughout there is a strong individual view of things . Individual enough to make them the unexpected , and therefore not likely to meet the formulated expectations of average " picture lovers . " The readers of the various books on " How to Appreciate Pictures " will not have learned how to appreciate yours , therefore pioneerlike you will have a rough road to travel with your public . Where others are clever and precise you are not . Where you are clever and precise , others are not . You have not interested yourself in these subjects in the expected ways . You have disregarded what you should have been conventionally expected to regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you would be expected  | to do your best , and have done well with insistence , with interest , where others neglect . For the critics of their times , Manet , Corot , Millet , took interest in the wrong side of things . They did not do the expected , but were pioneers ? followed their very individual whims , told their publics what they wanted their publics to hear , not what their publics already knew and wanted to be told over again . In all your pictures the eyes are remarkable no matter what may be my criticisms , ? technical , anatomical or otherwise . They are remarkable expressions of human sensitiveness . In the usual phraseology it might be said " They arrest , " " They haunt . " They are inscrutable , and yet they seem to invite one in . The six figures standing here before me look with their serious questioning eyes . They seem to ask me if there are not some deep sensations of life forgotten in this hurly burly business of New York City . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling you have about the " look of people . " You will gain by adding to your knowledge of the anatomy of an eye . You can learn much from cool study of a living eye . Examine it closely and record in your mind just what and where are its parts . You want to know an eye , nose , mouth , skull , the muscles . The sources of information are many , first the living feature itself , examined , studied . Then books on anatomy , photographs from life , reproductions from the works of great masters , then again the living feature itself . The muscles are functioning always in life . They show sometimes prominently ? easy to see . An arm in its strength is not difficult because there the actions of the  | muscles are obvious . In other places it is hard to see the muscles , hard to see the action . One who knows what is under the skin will understand ' the slightest change on the surface . He is able to separate the important from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the thing . He sees the slightest sign that has meaning , and is not deceived by accidents . If you actually know the human body you can draw most sensitive actions through clothes . You see the signs of life in the body through the clothes , and the wrinkles and folds of drapery become living things . You seize of them what is essential and discard the rest . Without knowledge and sense of the body , wrinkles and folds remain wrinkles and folds . There are thousands , however , who have drawn from the nude model for years , and passed quite well according to school standards , but who , nevertheless , do not know the human body . There are thousands who paint the features of the face and yet could not pass a childish examination in facial anatomy . This probably explains a good deal of the lifelessness existing in portraiture . The tendency of your color is straight , healthy , honest . I know you have only to go on in order to develop a most expressive color . In your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your vision of the sky . The Brown-Eyed Girl with the Cat ? Some frank notes in the cat 's head and good closed-eye character . Handsome in blue ribbon and the girl 's pigtails . Not quite  | enough " whole note " to the dress . There is a feeling for and a cherishing of the dress , but the underlying or mass color is not sufficient . You began painting variations before you established the mass . Not so in the hair , excellent ; and the face excellent . I admire this . A fine piece of painting , a frank rendering of character . I believe this is a good likeness . It is certainly a distinct type . When you are painting a background , do n't follow , unless there is a good reason to do so , the common habit of thinning the paint . Do n't try to spread too little paint over too great a surface . Mix if anything more than is needed . Put it on so that it will have the appearance of sufficiency . Repaint a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting in the head or body calls for a change in the background . The reason for many a feeble , false or inefficient background is lack of energy to do the labor of it . Paint the background in such a way as to appear to pass back of the head , not simply up to it . To return to the Little Girl and Cat , get a more beautiful relation in the proportions of the body , arms , legs and chair , more significantly appreciated . That leg is painfully brittle and thin . Your brush stroke is too often the same in figure , chair and background . In using everywhere this same stroke it becomes meaningless and it robs each part of character , texture , perspective and distance . The Man , austere , grave , wonderfully fine eyes , but undoubtedly exaggerated in their forms . Look again . It is excellent over-characterization , nevertheless . Arms stiff and scrawny . Do n't believe they were so . Good chair . It holds him .  | You are not yet a master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mind , serious , austere , showing that you are made of good stuff , should work . You will never become a popular painter . You are too much of an individual for that . Yours is a harder task , and one that will have fewer encouragers , but the popular painter is not in for as good a time as you are . Never change the course of a line until you have to . Never change the plane of a form until you have to . Never change the tone of a color or from one color to another until you have to . If you follow these injunctions intelligently you will practice that great economy which is necessary to expression in your medium . Every change must count , and count strong . There must be no quibbling . You have the observer of your work under control . Through the changes you lead him straight or crooked into your meaning . If you have digressed into triviality he must digress with you . Where you hesitate or are uncertain , he hesitates and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not direct in your purpose , he turns his back on your work unless he is , himself , like you , happier in floundering . Because the medium we use is very limited , we must exercise a great economy in its use . No line or form or color must change until you are compelled by the necessity of the structure you are making to change it .  | The need for change must be great . You only make the change because you must respond to an absolute demand . You have reserved your forces but now you must expend them positively and effectively . A new course , full of meaning is to be taken , and by it the observer is to be carried deeper into your meaning . You have taken a positive step to force his understanding of your motive . Some painters flutter all about their subjects , others are straight drivers to the essence of things . A house has many windows , but a ray of light catches on one . It becomes the window which declares all windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links with all the other structures ? is one of the big factors in making the whole . Your questions are , " What is essential ? " and " How shall the greatest economy be practiced ? " Water runs down hill concisely .. There is no quibbling about it . It does not have to run up hill in order to be entertaining . Man has always followed its course with fascination . The soul of man may reveal its mysteries through direct expression , simple speech , simple gesture , simple painting , just as the soul of the brook is expressed in full simplicity and economy . One of the curses of art is " Art . " This filling up of things with " decoration , " with by-play , to make them " beautiful . " When art has attained its place , surfaces will be infinitely , less broken . There will then be millions less of things , less words , less gesture , less of everything . But  | each word and each gesture and everything will count in a fuller value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of things , we will need fewer things . We will not change a line or form or color until we have to ? and when we do make a change , a wealth of meaning will fill the world from this new gesture . The most furnished rooms may have very little in them . The mere proportions of a room act on our sensibilities much more than is declared by our present consciousness . Man suffers , but it is in very little that he knows why he suffers . He is happy and he is equally ignorant . As he comes to know better the significance of change he can be less hurt and he can move more swiftly to his natural environment . It is not the barrenness of an empty room , or an empty life that we seek , we would get rid of clutter , and thus get room for fulness . On a face one accent rightly valued in all its powers is worth a thousand little forms . The little forms subtract more than they add . The right accent achieves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are as different as opposites in their course of life . They do but confound each other in their effort to believe themselves alike . One family may be called the digressors ? those who live with the billions of things , the billions of ideas which clutter up the surface of life . The members of the other group tend toward a simplicity of sight , are conscious of a main current , are related to the past , see into the future , are not of the time present , but extend forward and back .  | Be game ? take a chance ? do n't hide behind veils and veils of discretion . The spirit of youth should be in the young . Do n't try to be ponderous . Youth has clear eyes . Let your colors be as seen with clear eyes . Go forward with what you have to say , expressing things as you see them . You are new evidence , fresh and young . Your work , the spirit of youth , you are the progress of human evolution . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ponderous and heavy ? or quit . It takes a tremendous amount of courage to be young , to continue growing ? not to settle and accept . The most beautiful life possible , wherein there is no sordidness , is only attainable by effort . To be free , to be happy and fruitful , can only be attained through sacrifice of many common but overestimated things . On the steps of the Prado I met a well-known French painter who was there like myself studying the Spanish masters . It was in 1900 and the great exhibition of Goya 's work had just opened . He said " Have you seen the Goyas ! A wonderful genius ! What a pity he could n't draw ! " Goya drew well enough to make this man think he was a genius , anyhow . Manet did not do the expected . He was a pioneer . He followed his individual whim . Told the public what he wanted it to know , not the time-worn things the public  | already knew and thought it wanted to hear again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Periods . Periods when we freshen , become disposed toward health and happiness , move forward into hopeful philosophy . Then comes the stamp of personal whim . Technique becomes a tool , not an objective . We are interested and we have expressions we must make . All things are appreciated with an abundance of humor . There is an association with nature . Something happens between us and the flowers in a garden , a communication of gayety , a rhythm in the grass understood ? something charming in a day 's wash hung on the line ? a song running through it all . Associations with nature . It 's a state to be in and a state to paint in . There is a past , present and future in the fall of a dress . Do n't arrange it . In the old days of long skirts the models used to wonder why I made them walk from the end of the room to the place where I would have them pose . They were to continue walking until I spoke , and then they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to say . It was not always a success , but eventually it would happen right , and the fall of the drapery would express the gesture of movement , the arrest and the possible next gesture . There  | would be a past , present and future , and there would be unity and rhythm in the dress . Continuity . You draw this leg as though it were near the body ? so near that separation is not visible , yet you do not make me feel that the two are one . The leg must go right into and all through the body . You can learn to make a good map of the model , but it will remain only a map unless you intend to make it more . Map making is difficult , and in some cases useful , but our business is more important , infinitely more difficult and ever so much more interesting . I do not say , however , but that a simply made map might serve you as something to underlay a drawing . But map making and drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in the past or the future ? the present being but for an instant ? not that of course , in fact . In the future there is the reality. ! The past is the history of our failure in attaining it . / Superficially there is negligence , but deep down in people there is love and craving for the beautiful . There are many who go through their whole lives without ever knowing when they have liked or what they have liked . Keep up the work . Try to reduce everything you see  | to the utmost simplicity . That is , let nothing but the things which are of the utmost importance to you have any place . The more simply you see , the more simply you will render . People see too much , scatteringly . A landscape has got to mean a great deal to anyone before it can be painted in any worthwhile way . It is harder to see a landscape than to paint it . This is true because there are lots of clever people who can paint anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . The technique used to express a dull idea is of the nature of the idea , and however skilled it may be it is still dull . The technique of a fine idea is likewise born of the idea , and is like its parent . Seeing is not such an easy thing as it is supposed to be . Letter to the Class Se It is important that you reach out for all information regarding the materials you use . You must know your tools . You must have the best , and they must be in perfect arrangement for service . Painting requires great judgment and skill . In the effort to capture and record in paint one 's sensations , there must be no handicap with the materials . It is only now and again that the best masters succeed , even though they have a highly developed technique . It is characteristic of the masters who have the ability to now and again succeed , that they profoundly study the caption* Art Students League , 1915  | means and ways of their expression . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order in their preparation for work , and this order continues throughout their performance . To be negligent , to be above such mean things as the materials one handles , to be a sort of genius in a dream , is a common misconception of an artist 's state . On the contrary his whole success in self expression depends on order , or balance , which , in fact , is not only the means to the end , but the work itself is great in measure as it stands as a manifestation of order and balance . Such works give us our vision of freedom . For freedom can only be obtained through order ? through a just sense of the relative value of things . The technique of painting begins with the simplest mechanical issues and extends through to the heights of science . You should begin with the simplest issues . See that your palette is a good tool , sizable for what you have to do . See that it is well set with clean pigment , ordered to the greatest convenience for your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of your craftsmanship . See to the size , quality and condition of your brushes , they are to be handled for a difficult operation . See to your medium . Are the cups right in size for your brushes ? Are they securely attached in place most convenient for the service ? Have you the rag and have you the other facilities for cleaning your brushes as you work ? It is surprising how these and many more equally simple and equally important questions can seldom be answered in a favorable way .  | A barber has an apparatus that is surprising , and all in such remarkable order . His intention is but to shave and cut hair with the least amount of discomfort to the sitter . An artist proposes to make a work of art , and while his work requires infinite skill , he is generally far behind the barber in the arrangement of the most ordinary necessities . Why should this be so ? Why should a studio be a boudoir , a dream of oriental splendor to have tea in , a junk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient workshop for the kind of thought and the kind of work that the making of a good picture demands ? Why should a palette be a crust of dirty , dust collecting , dried up paint in which little inadequate squeezes of fresh paint become confounded ? Why should n't the whole thing be cleaned up every day , with ways devised for the saving over night of the good paint that remains from the day 's work ? The reason for all these things is that one does as one 's neighbor does , and as your neighbor is no more of a pioneer or inventor than you are yourself , you do not move out of your uncomfortable position until a new neighbor comes along and shoves you out of it ? if such is possible , which it may not be , for many get ossified in matters of technique , and while they are not comfortable they are still immovable . The thing to do is for each individual to wake up , to discover himself as a human being , with needs of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look within , and find if he can invent for himself a vehicle for his self-expression . He has a world of precedents to begin on , some within his sight , and more can be found . Let him move about a bit ; investigate the needs of his own case .  | To have ideas one must have imagination . To express ideas one must have science . All this is to urge you to investigate , to read , to think . You will understand what the word technique refers to . You will wake up to the fact that the , only education that counts is self-education There are the facilities of the school , its advices , there are books , strengths and weaknesses of those about you . All these things are good materials to the one who will use them constructively . When I read about artists and their works I am not as a rule interested in what is said about their works , but am keen to know of the personalities of the artists themselves . If I want to know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reproduction . I find it is usually not at all like the writer 's description . Pictures explain themselves ? They are their own describers . Sometimes it does happen that the writer , in his effort to describe a picture , reveals himself ; and if his philosophy is interesting it is worth hearing him , even if he has insisted on explaining a thing which is already self-explained . When children are taken to a museum they are too often talked out of their personal appreciations . A friend of mine took his two boys to the circus . It was their first circus . He was worried and discouraged because his boys did not get the thing . He kept saying to them  | " Look ! Look ! " but they were always looking the wrong way . It was pretty tough to find that his boys were not real boys . That night he left the table to read his paper . The boys remained with their mother , and from the next room he heard them tell what they had seen at the circus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were real boys ! They had seen all and several times more than he had . Take a change from your little fragmentary life-studies on a 5-by-9 paper . Cast about a bit . My advice to you is to venture , meet some other difficulties , be a real student . Real students go out of beaten paths , whether beaten by themselves or by others , and have adventure with the unknown . There are few students in the schools . They are rare anywhere . And yet it is only the student who dares to take a chance , who has a real good time in life . But remember that I say it is even possible for you to follow your old method and have the adventures and come out all right . It 's altogether what you are able to get out of it . Be sure that your decisions are really made by yourself . Decisions made by yourself may be of a nature very unexpected . In other words , very few people know what they want , very few people know what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work try something different .  | think and do not know it and many think they are thinking and are not thinking . Self education is no easy proposition . Men either get to know what they want , and go after it , or some other persons tell them what they want and drive them after it . I ca n't tell you what you want to do , ca n't lay any plans for your doing it . You must surprise me . I am not interested in your being the kind of regular fellow who tells me what I know before . The case is in your own hands . Get as much acquainted with yourself as you can . Question yourself . After a while you may get some answers . They will surprise and shock you , but they will interest you . Maybe you will get so that you will begin to do things for yourself . It will be very fine when you can begin to serve yourself . After all , your " method " of work is nothing . Why be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you step out of your rut you do n't do as well . But what does that matter ? It may come better later . Anyway , do n't be a slave to a " method , " to a 5-by-9 piece of paper . Do n't let anyone drive you away from your method and your 5-by-9 piece of paper . Do n't be a slave either way . Ask yourself . There is no school that will exactly fit you . There is no advice made just for your case . The air is full of advice . Every school is waiting , whether it is willing or not , for you to make it your school . I do not know if this answer to your questions will be satisfactory to you , but it 's the most useful I can give . Do not let the fact that things are not made for you , that conditions are not as they should be , stop you . Go  | on anyway . Everything depends on those who go on anyway . Letter Concerning Prizes and Medals The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so great that it should be stopped . You can give prizes justly for long-distance jumps , because you can measure jumps with a foot-rule . No way has been devised for measuring the value of a work of art . History proves that juries in art have been generally wrong . With few exceptions the greatest artists have been repudiated by the art juries in all countries and at all times . For a single example I will say that very few if any prizes or medals were awarded to the artists who ' .. are now in their old age , or after their death , the glory of France . In fact most of them did not get past the jury of admission . It 's not that the juries do not mean well , or at least think they mean well , but it is simply that art can not be measured . The reason for the survival of the award system is purely commercial . I suggest that you use the money to buy pictures ; that you let this action carry with it the satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you choose the pictures you buy , yourselves , making your own mistakes , learning the lessons which you will learn from your own mistakes ; and that you hang up the pictures you buy in your permanent collection to represent your judgment .  | Every community should have its own will , and have the courage of it . Should develop its own power of judgment . Mistakes must be risked . There are collectors who do not do much or anything for themselves in the field of art . They do not select their own pictures , but they pay another man to make what mistakes are to be made , and this man has a wonderful and improving time doing it . Perhaps you will see by what I say , that I am more interested in the artistic development of a community than I am in adding titles to artists ' names . Nothing can help the artist more than such actual participation as I suggest . I should like every community to have a will of its own ; to be distinctly like itself ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to choose its own pictures , hang them up , and then take them down again when they no longer like them , and replace them with such others as they have come to like . - To visit such a community would be interesting , would shock or please , would shake us up a bit , and cause revaluation . There would be some things in that place which one could not find in any other place . We might like or we might not like it , but the place would have its effect on us . It would not be negative . An artist must educate himself , he can not be educated , he must test things out as they apply to himself ; his life is one long investigation of things and his own reaction to them . If he is to be interesting to us it is because he renders a very personal account . If a community is to be inter-  | esting to outsiders or have any sort of an existence , any sort of a good time , it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art , it takes on a big job . Not an outside job , but an inside job , and one that can be most enjoyable and most profitable . The greatest honor you can do an artist is to buy his picture and hang it up in your gallery . All art that is worth while is a. record of intense life , and each individual artist 's work is a record of his special effort , search and findings , in language especially chosen by himself and devised best to express him , and the significance of his work can only be understood by careful study ; no crack-judgment , looking for the expected , will do , norI can we be informed by the best critics , for appreciation is individual , differs with each individual and is an act of creation based on the picture which is an organization , ! not a mirror of the artist 's vision ; but the essential principle of it , and therefore of basic value to the creative k impulse in the spectator . All interesting developments in art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best appreciators have had to suspend judgment during the period necessary for full consideration . I value the effect of new notes on myself . I believe in constant revaluation . To appreciate and get a great deal from a work of art does not mean to find the expected in it , nor does it mean , necessarily to accept or follow it wholly , in part , or at all .  | Every work is one man 's vision , an outside experience , useful to us in our own constructions . The wisdom and the mistakes of the past are ours to build on , and the picture painted yesterday , now hanging on the wall , is already of the past and is a part of our heritage . I regard the battlers for ideas and the builders of new roads with enthusiasm and reverence . Their works ( the record of their struggles and findings ) are things to watch and to cherish . This is the way I feel about the works of serious men whether they be of the past or of today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , AU do I care for art as art . I am interested in life . The most we can desire of men is that they be masters of such as they have , and then we should be highly satisfied with them , and regard them as neither less nor greater than any . Place them as themselves . I claim for each one free speech , free hearing . I am interested in the open forum , open for every man to come with his word and for every man to come to hear the evidence , unticketed , unprejudiced by jury or critic . If you want to be a historical painter , let your history be of your own time , of what you can get to know personally ? of manners and customs within your own experience . John Leech was a comic artist on Punch , and while no one would care much to look over the Royal Academy catalogues of his time , the pages in Punch by John Leech hold our interest to this day . Leech is known as a " comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the choice of his expression , was noble . He is one of the  | greatest artists England has had , and because he was so interested in life as he found it his works have a great historical value . Rembrandt did not go out of his own sphere to make his religious subjects ? he applied the ideas to the materials of his own life . That is one of the reasons his work is so lasting in our interest . If you must paint a " Good Samaritan " do not paint the old story , in the old form , but let your subject be the recurrence of the spirit of the good Samaritan as it presents itself to you in your own environment . These great moments did n't happen just once ? they still continue to happen . Perhaps some of you will recall seeing a picture painted by John Sloan of the backs of the old Twenty-fourth Street houses with the boys on the roof startling the pigeons into flight . It is a human document of the lives of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows , the incidents in the construction of the houses , the incidents in the wear and tear on them ; in fact , the life of that neighborhood is all shown in the little line of houses , yellow and red houses , warm in the sunlight . And the quality of the sunlight is that of a caress ; the houses , the atmosphere are steeped in its warmth . That canvas will carry into future time the feel and the way of life as it happened and as it was seen and understood by the artist . Sometimes in looking at the people of an old Chinese painting I have felt how close in human kinship these ancients were to me . In all other forms of record they appear remote . The artist , who is not a materialist , sees  | more than the incident .

Even the prints of these , clipped from the magazine in which they were published , are now treasured , mainly , of course , by artists ( for artists do know something about art ) and are shown to friends with a great pride in their possession . Ever since the beginning there have been artists who have found in the simple life about them the wonderful and the beautiful , and through the fact of this inspiration have sensed the way to make the combinations of form and color we know as art . Genius is not a possession of the limited few , but exists in some degree in everyone . Where ' there is natural growth , a full and free play of faculties , genius will manifest itself . The disposition to preconceive one 's degree of genius , or the quality of it , is a mistake , for this preconception is a limitation . The results of individual development can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in whom such development has not as yet taken place . It is useless to study technique in advance of having a motive . Instead of establishing a vast stock of technical tricks , it would be far wiser to develop creative power  | by constant search for means particular to a motive already in mind , by studying and developing just that technique which you feel the immediate need of , and which alone will serve you for the idea or the emotion which has moved you to expression . You will not only develop your power to see the means , but you will acquire power to organize the means to a purpose . In this form of study there will be no less familiarization with what is generally found in all technical study . You will acquire a habit and ability to select and correlate . You will become a master and organizer of means , and you will understand the value of means as no mere collector of means ever can . I have known many men who have read everything , have what is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of the essential qualities , or the possibilities , through organization , of anything . Such as these while appearing learned through familiarity with learning make no constructions of their own , for the genius in them is still dormant . To be an artist is to construct , and to whatever degree one shows the genius for construction in work of any sort , he is that much an artist . The artist life is therefore the desirable life , and it is possible to all . Letter of Criticism Both yours received and the last understood in all its loneliness . You have a hard proposition , but I believe if you fight it through it will be all the better .  | Of course you ca n't expect to go out and paint masterpieces every day , and you ca n't expect to equal steadily what you have already done .

Like some of those I did last summer . But you have got to think there alone , and work to keep yourself company , and thinking and working is what counts . In the cities , in the studios , there is usually too little time to think matters through . Most things are skimmed , and people often believe they are doing quite a good deal themselves when they are only being jostled by others . Up there , whatever will be interesting will be your ideas , and whatever will be done will be your work . But a man is human . Well , you are going to Boston to a genial friend for a few days . Have a good time !

And then after the long season  | of dead Haarlem and work , the solid bunch of simple amusement in Paris . It looks to me as though you might break your long quiets by letting loose occasionally . But you are up against it and it is up to you . You have gone there to find yourself . What you have started , this thing of becoming an artist , a real one , almost every man fails at .

I have lived , a little younger than you , where there was equal cold and more exposure . I have known ever since what it is to be in the cold and alone , and sometimes desperately so , because I have believed what I believe and have stood by my believing . You go on .

Of course I do not believe in the place you have chosen more than another place . If you should think a warmer or a more populated place would be better do n't consider stubbornness a virtue . To work , mind and body , and to be alone enough to concentrate is the thing . I think you will like it there , though mind you , you have only been there a short time . You are not yet used to the weather . You ca n't jump from comfort into the conditions of such life . And then the snow is to come . Get ready for the wonder of it , and paint like a fiend while the ideas possess you .

Drawing that is solid , constructive , fundamental , inventive , specific , adapted to the special needs of the idea to be expressed ; such drawing as can come only from one who has a decided and special purpose , profound understanding , a realization of the importance of his word , and the evidence he has to give . A school where individuality of thought and individuality of expression is encouraged . A school and instruction which offers itself to the student to be used by him in the building of himself up into a force that will be of a stimulating value to the world .

To be the deepest thinker , the kindest appreciator , the clearest and simplest , frankest creator he can be today , for by so doing he is the master of such as he has today , and that he is master today is the only dependable evidence that he will be master tomorrow ; that he has dignity , worth , integrity , courage in his thought and action today proves that he is today a student such as is worthy of the name in its fullest meaning . Letter I have no sympathy with the belief that art is the restricted province of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope we will come to an understanding that the material used is only incidental , that there is artist in every man ; and that to him the possibility of development and of expression and the happiness of creation is as much a right and as much a duty to himself , as to any of those who work in the especially ticketed ways . There is much talk of the " growth of art " in America , but the proof offered deals too often with the increase in purchases . I 'm sure it often happens that the purchaser believes he has done his art bit for himself and for the public , when he has bought . Being a struggling artist myself , far be it from me to say he should not buy ! But buying is not enough . We may build many imitation Greek temples and we may buy them full of pictures , but there is something more ? in fact the one thing more which really *Pleiades Club Yearbook , 1918.  | counts before we can be an art nation ? we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on art . We must get on the inside and press out . Art is simply a result of expression during right feeling . It 's a result of a grip on the fundamentals of nature , the spirit of life , the constructive force , the secret of growth , a real understanding of the relative importance of things , order , balance . Any material will do . After all , the object is not to make art , but to be in the wonderful state which makes art inevitable . In every human being there is the artist , and whatever his activity , he has an equal chance with any to express the result of his growth and his contact with life . I do n't believe any real artist cares whether what he does is " art " or not . Who , after all , knows what is art ? Were not our very intelligent fathers admirers of Bouguereau , and was not Bouguereau covered with all the honors by which we make our firsts , and were they not ready to commit Cezanne to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real artists are too busy with just being and growing and acting ( on canvas or however ) like themselves to worry about the end . The end will be what it will be . The object is intense living , fulfillment ; the great happiness in creation . People sometimes phrase about the joy of work . It is only in creative work that joy may be found . To create we must get down to bedrock . You can not construct unless you get at the principles of construction . The principles of construction are applicable to any work . If you get away from these principles , your structure will fall down when it is put to the test . Governments have  | fallen because their ideas of order were not based on natural principles . Sentiment , money , violence were not the agents in the creation of that master work of art , the flying machine . The Wright brothers had a wonderful will to comprehend natural law . Billions of dollars could not buy , blind faith could not persuade , violence could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comparatively little money , no sentimentality , and came easily , because they went to the right source . We will be happy if we can get around to the idea that art is not an outside and extra thing ; that it is a natural outcome of a state of being ; that the state of being is the important thing ; that a man can be a carpenter and be a great man . There is a book about a fisherman written by Jeanette Lee , called " Happy Island " ? a very simple little book , but it is worth reading apropos , for that fisherman was a great man and had in him the secret of a great nation . I think a great nation must be a happy one . I remember a great picture ? it is no larger than my two hands ? it represents seven pears , and evokes everything ? cathedrals , beautiful ladies . Such was the spirit of the artist that for me he projected universal essentials of beauty . In his seven pears he evidently found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the little things as well as in the big . If I were to try to review the art of the past year it would be to estimate how far we have gone in this idea . But I will not try to review the art of the past year ? it ca n't be done ? it is too near to us . We have been terribly busy with it , and it is not yet through with us . Our past  | is our mystery . It is the tangle we have made of our hopes when we have come up to them . The future alone is clear . No nation as yet is the home of art . Art is an outsider , a gypsy over the face of the earth . The only sensible way to regard the art life is that it is a privilege you are willing to pay for . Seldom has the great art or the great science of the world been paid for at the time of creation . It has been given , and in general has been cruelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money paid , but I would have you note that these were paid a long time after the creator had gone through his struggles . Breadth is useless unless it effects expression . Sometimes an almost imperceptible note plays a great part in the making of a picture . It is not necessarily the obvious thing which counts strongest . The great moments of a day are sometimes such as hardly reach our consciousness , yet such moments may have made all the beauty and the success of the day . The almost imperceptible note may be the most powerful constructive agent in a whole work .  | A red flower placed in a window may expand its influence over all the area of your sight . A man possessed of an idea , working like fury to hold his grip on it and to fix it on canvas may not stop to see just how he is doing the work ; nor may he consider what might be any outsider 's opinion of it . He must hold his grip on the meaning he has caught from nature , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need is immediate . The idea is fleeting . He must have technique ? but he can now use only what he actually knows . At other times he has studied technique , tried this and that , experimented , and hunted for the right phrase . But now he is not in the hour of research . He is in the hour of expression . The only thing he has in mind is the idea . As to the elegance of his expression , he can not think of it . It is the idea , and the idea alone which possesses him , and ' because it must be expressed , because he has need to express it , he makes a great draft on his memory , on all his store of knowledge and past experience , and all these he regulates into service . If later we find that there was an elegance in his expression , that there was brilliant technique , still he was not aware of it at the time of its accomplishment . It is only the sign of the success of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him at a time of great need . He was not conscious of his gracefulness , for it was only a result of the high state of order to which he had raised himself .  | A young girl may come into a room and with her thoroughly unconscious gesture bring animation and a sense of youth , health and good will . It is a fine technique which she employs , for all in the room receive her message and she imparts without loss somewhat of her youth and spirit to each one present . Her technique is handled as only a master could handle it ; that is , without thinking of it . In the activities of play she has made her body supple and it readily responds to her emotion . Through gesture she has a language that is so much her own that it is spontaneous . She is young , she is healthy , and she looks on the world with a wonderful good will and there is a need within her to transform all environment to her own likeness . Her whole body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about her is in service and is unconsciously ordered to express and spread the influence of the song that is in her . If , on the other hand , she is one of those terrible creatures who must walk and talk with the airs of their betters , who must in some way pretend to be that which they are not , we may see a very skilled technique , one filled with a thousand clever tricks , but it is a self-conscious technique ? one which is an end in itself . We often meet men who wear a mask of great profundity who would be bored to death in being profound . A scientist is not a scientist in order to be a scientist . He is what he is because he wants to know about life . The scientist wants to know life ? therefore the marvels of mathematics . The young girl wants to live in the happiness of her state  --  therefore her buoyant gesture .  | The artist wishes to declare the significances he finds in nature  --  therefore the painter 's technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is without motive . The simplest form is perhaps that of the juggler . Whether he catches the balls in his hands or not , the balls go up into the air , perform perfectly natural curves and fall according to the laws of nature . Whether he catches them or not what the balls do is equally beautiful . But the motive is to catch the balls , and the marvel is in the manifestation and the achievement of the motive . A line , or a form , or a color , therefore can not be meaningful in itself . It must have motive , and to have motive it must be related to other lines , forms and colors . It must have sequence and an end must be attained . If the end is a simple one the sequences will be equally simple . If the end is the revelation of a profound mystery of nature the sequences must be equal to it , for the revelation is written in every part of the construction . If the technique of a master is marvelous , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered the life , the look , and all about an eye in a stroke or two ? it is not that he has a bag of tricks . It is that with a mighty power of seeing the particular eye and an absolute need to express it , he uses judgment and he taps all his store of v experience : the eye is not made in a stroke or two because he wants to make it in a stroke or two . IIe does not care how many or how few strokes it takes . The eye is what he wants . Later he may himself marvel at the simplicity of its rendering , and other days ; in the days of research , he may  | set himself the task of doing an eye in a stroke or two and work hard at it . It is likely that in such conscious effort he will not come anywhere near equaling the aforesaid eye , but what he will do and what he will think in this experience will sink into him and will become part of that store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of great need . I count on seeing your new work when you come to town , and I count on finding in it the likeness of the man I know . The techniques which are beautiful are the inventions of those who have the will to make intimate human records . Be a warhorse for work , and enjoy even the struggle against defeat . Keep painting , it 's the best thing in the world to do . Learn that there are different views and that it is up to you to make your own judgments . See the value in compositional work and do n't be a life-class hack . Do n't believe that sitting in an art school and patiently patting paint on canvases will eventually make you an artist . There is more than that . If a new movement in art comes along be awake to it , study it , but do n't belong to it . Have a personal humor about things . You will never know your calibre until you have tried yourself . Avoid idle industry . Always leave out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to you . Examine others . Have a pioneer spirit . Prevent your drawing from being common . Put life into it . The way to do this is to see the model , see  | that the model is great , wonderful ? a human creature there before you in the tragedy and comedy of life ? then draw . Avoid mannerisms , your own and other people 's . Preserve your originality by painting what is before you as you see it , for things have a special look to you . Make your pictures of big pieces rather than small ones . Through the big pieces the statement can be made frankly and fully . Get the easy naturalness of nature . Nature is full of surprises . They happen equally in great and small events , and are inevitable results . They are parts of a sequence . Make your picture as full of surprises and as easy as nature . Do n't ever stock your head so full of " learning " that there will be no room left for personal thinking . Develop your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Develop the power to express through the effort and pleasure of expression . Was of Study The school is not a place where students are fitted into the groove of rule and regulation , but where personality and originality of vision is encouraged , and inventive genius in the search for specific expression is stimulated . The real study of technique is not the acquirement of a vast stock of pat phrases , but rather the avoidance of such , and the creation of a phrase special to the idea . To accomplish this , one must first have the idea and then active inventive wit to make the specifying phrase . This places the idea prior to the technique as a cause for the latter , contrary to the academic idea , which is the reverse .  | I am saying this with reference to the " hard grind " and " grammar " ideas . Hard grind ! I was in art schools for three years before I really began the struggle with mind and body to do something with my faculties other than the sheer mechanical process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as plumbline and a stick with notches in it . I know the " hard grind " and the " grammar " study both here and in Paris , and while I was in it I was regarded as typical , for I was anxious , and I worked all day and all evening . From my own experience I know that " mindless drudgery " would be a better name than " hard grind , " and that " idle industry " would be equally descriptive of such work . There are at present , all over the world , art students sitting meekly at their work copying external appearances in whatever is the fashion of the school in which they work , copying lines and tints of models of which they have no idea , no understanding , for which they have no respect , no enthusiasm , putting off to some future day that sensitive appreciation , that grasping of significance , that announcing of a special evidence of their own about the matter , simply " hard grinding ! " Maybe the name is not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technique of what ? For the expression of what ? Studying construction ? Construction of what ? What a deception ! Those meek students , plodding away , afraid to use their intelligence lest they make mistakes , have a faith that after so much virtuous humble tint and line copying , years of it , the gift of imagination , the power to say things the  | world is in need of hearing for profit or pleasure and the special management of the medium , will be handed to them as a diploma is handed to a graduate . The man who becomes a master starts out by being master of such as he has , and the man who is master at any time of such as he has is at that time straining every faculty . What he learns then from his experience is fundamental , constructive , to the point . His wits are being used and are being formed into the habit of usage . He is working on his direct road . His " grind " is hard . His brain as well as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard grind " is not a dull grind . For he is grinding something . He is studying grammar because he needs it , and needing it he studies with greater wit , and knows it when he finds it . This " goring slow , " this " hard grind , " this study of " grammar " as understood in Julian 's Academy and in the academies that have sprung from Julian 's is too easy . There is not in it the " hard grind " that makes a man find himself and invent special language for his personal expression . I am for drawing and for construction , for continued and complete study , acquirement of firm foundation . But the drawing I am interested in is the drawing that draws something , the construction which constructs . And the idea to be expressed must be at least worthy of the means . I find nature " as is " a very wonderful romance and no man-made concoctions have ever beaten it either in romance or sweetness.  | Everything depends on the attitude of the artist toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is on this attitude of the artist toward his subject that the real quality of the picture , its significance , and the nature and distinction of its technique depends . If your attitude is negligent , if you are not awake to the possibilities you will not see them . Nature does not reveal herself to the negligent . As a matter of fact the most ordinary model is in reality a fascinating mysterious manifestation of life and is worthy of the greatest gifts anyone may have of appreciation and expression . It was the attitude of Velasquez toward his model that got for him the look which so distinguishes his portraits . The people he painted were conscious of the humanity and the respect of the man before them . They knew that he could pierce masks and that he could appreciate realities with unbounded sympathy . They undoubtedly enjoyed posing for him , and while he painted they looked at him ? responded to his look ? were frank with him , and revealed without pomp or negation their full dignity as human beings . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pity and respect . In that studio the king and Velasquez met and in the portrait that was painted we see eyes and gesture which tell of an unusual contact . To Velasquez he responded , and he was safe to take his true position ? that of a man , not good , not bad , not great , but conscious of the futility of pomp ; touched with sadness , possessed of a  | certain innate dignity , and craving above all things just that kind of human sympathy and respect which Velasquez , with love and without fear , was capable of giving . Philip IV sat for many portraits to Velasquez , and it was probable that he did so because the contact meant for him his greatest moments . There is something in environment which affects all men , causes them to live for a time in a surprising fullness , or , on the other hand , causes them to close up . By a compelling impulse a man goes for a day in the woods . Just why the impulse came to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonders at it , but there is some vague thought of freedom . He plunges into the rough parts of the wood , climbs under and over . He runs wild . He tears his clothes ? but it does not matter . The business of his progress is met with enthusiastic energy and time passes as in a dream . And concurrent with his action there is thought of a surprising fluid character . His attitude toward the life he has just stepped out of has wholly changed . Intricacies untangle . He sees people in new values . Bitter feelings have disappeared . He is over and above all petty grudges , envies or fears . Something has happened . The spirit of the wood has possessed him . He has got into rhythm . Surely he is no longer in his usual plane of life . It is a day of clear seeing . Later , days later , in his office he can not recall just what it was that passed ? just what that ecstasy of the wood really meant , but he has a memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen it from a different angle and in a way that simplified many matters . When the dwarfs posed for Velasquez they were no longer laughing stock for the court , and we see in their portraits a look of wisdom , human pathos and a balancing courage . Velasquez knew them as fellowmen with hearts and minds and strange experiences . He knew them as capable of sensitive approach . Even in the madman it is the glimmer of human sensibility , a groping of a puzzled heart , that makes the great moving force of the picture . Where others saw a pompous king , a funny clown , a misshapen body to laugh at , Velasquez saw deep into life and love , and there was response in kind for his look . If you paint children you must have no patronizing attitude toward them . Whoever approaches a child without humility , without wonderment and without infinite respect , misses in his judgment of what is before him , and loses an opportunity for a marvelous response . Children are greater than the grown man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few retain the greatness that was theirs before the system of compromises began in their lives . I have never respected any man more than I have some children . In the faces of children I have seen a look of wisdom and of kindness expressed with such ease and such certainty that I knew it was the expression of a whole race . Later , that child would grow into being a man or woman and fall , as most of us do , into the business of little detail with only now and then a glimmering remembrance of a lost power . A rare few remain simple and hold on through life to their  | universal kinship , wade through all detail and can still look out on the painter with the simplicity of a child and the wisdom of the race plus an individual experience . These , however , are rare , but the potentiality exists in practically all children . We will not see much of any of this unless the quality of our attitude is equal to it . The sky will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvelous to the eye of a Constable . Still-life will be dead , inert , to the eye that does not start it in motion . To a Cezanne all its parts will live , they will interact and sense each other . All nature has powers of response . We have always been conscious of it . Our idea that things are dead or inert is a convention . I am not particular how you take this , scientifically or otherwise ; my simple motive is to make such suggestions as will bring strongly to mind the thought that the student in the school or the artist in the studio must be in a highly sensitive and receptive mood , that negligence is not a characteristic of the artist , that he must not bind himself with preconceived ideas , must keep himself free in the attitude of attention , for he can never be greater than the thing before him ? which is nature , whatever else it is , and nature contains all mysteries .  | ART is the giving by each man of his evidence to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give , discover the pleasure of giving . Those who give are tremendously strong . Be always looking for the thing you like and not afraid of overstating it . We want the simple vision of one who sees and enjoys . Suppose all people try to declare the things they like . Terrible to have an artist put into his portrait what he does not like in the sitter . If we could only learn to see while we are painting as we see when we enjoy things . It wo n't do to blunt and dull your sensitiveness . Study to appreciate . What we need is more sense of the wonder of life and less of this business of making a picture . Your painting is the marking of your progression into nature , a sensation of something you see way beyond the two pretty colors over there . Do n't stop to paint the material , but push on to give the spirit . We do not enjoy or admire the material in life , for we hate a miser or a merely business man . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should work like a person who sees beyond the material . When we look at anything , we see beyond the objects we draw . We should draw with this spiritual sight . Thus the measure of a painting is the conception of the artist . The value of a work of art depends on the flight the observer takes from it . A sign makes us see no end of things . Painting is to a great extent a thing of signs . Of the many forms on the  | model there are very few that the greatest artist B need employ . The cause of revolutions in art is , that , at times , feeling drops out of the work and it must fight to get back in again . Those who express even a little of themselves never become old-fashioned . The only true modern movement is a frank expression j of self . The artist should have a powerful will . He should be powerfully possessed by one idea . He should be intoxicated with the idea of the thing he wants to express . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of unessential things . A picture should be the expression of the will of the painter . We have very little idea and sight of big things , but a splendid idea of little ones . This is the reason the war could occur . Such evil growths as its cause would otherwise have been foreseen . People have not looked largely at life , mainly because our education drowns us in detail . We do n't see the why of it all . Even the superficial thing c is important if you can see way beyond it . This is true of painting . Much can be said with a few elements if you can see each in its place . There is a joy in the pursuit of anything . Life is finding yourself . It is a spirit development . Drawing A drawing should be a verdict on the model . Do n't i confuse a drawing with a map .  | Lines are results , do not draw them for themselves . Your drawing should be an expression of your spiritual sight . You should draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be the drawing of strong intentions . Every line should be the universe to you . Every line should carry a thousand pounds . A line expresses your pride , fear and hope . A line that has come from a line . Lines give birth to lines . Drawing is not following a line on the model , it is drawing your sense of the thing . Reality is obtained not by imitation , but by producing the sense of nature . Has your drawing the meaning you saw in the model at first ? Make a drawing flow , stopping sometimes , and going on . Yours should be the drawing of the human spirit through the human form . You will never draw the sense of a thing unless you are feeling it at the time you work . Search for the simple constructive forces , like the lines of a suspension bridge . Get the few main lines and see what lines they call out . Some lines are as though they would like to run off the canvas . Keep a bad drawing until by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work for continuity of line . Strength is gained through culmination .  | Have a motive in breaking a plane . Have purpose in the places where lines stop . Keep thinking of rhythm of line and of forms . Colors should have rhythmic effect . Count on big line to express your ideas . Find and lose . Find the big shape of the head . All the small bumps are but variations under control of the big shape . This is constructive drawing . The act of receiving is as difficult a feat and as creative as the act of giving . Therefore help the observer by making your painting simple .
