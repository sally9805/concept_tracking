txt Baseball " fans " are attracted to exhibitions of the national game as given by the major leagues because they believe that it is " on the level . " If their faith in it as an honestly conducted sport is shaken ' by more revelations that games are " thrown " and that players bet on the result , there will be no " heroes , " attendance will dwindle , and dividends for the stockholders will be small or none at all . The latest scandal , which is not as malodorous as the conspiracy to lose a world 's series in 1919 , but tainted beyond a doubt , concerns two of the greatest players the diamond has ever known , TY Coss and Tins SPEAKER , also WOOD , a former pitcher for the Cleveland Americans , and LEONARD , a former pitcher for the Detroit Americans . In 1919 , which seems to have been a black year for baseball , COBB was manager of the Detroit club and SPEAKER of the Cleveland club . On Sept , 24 the tour players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field , Detroit , according to LEONARD , and came to an understanding that in the game of the following day Detroit should win and all four of them would make bets on the result . Cleveland was then secure in second place in the American League . and with another victory Detroit , it was calculated , would move up into third , place . LEONARD and WOOD placed bets on the game and won sums that were small because they could not get all their money " down . " SPEAKER , it appears , did not place a bet . Coss denies that he took advantage of the opportunity . LEONARD has turned over to Commissioner LANDIS a letter written by COBB to LEONARD after the season was over , which on its face seems to involve the manager of the Detroit-. in an unsuccessful attempt to wager a considerable sum . COBB explains that he was really writing about the failure of LEONARD and WOOD to place all their money . But Commissioner LANDIS is skeptical . A second letter , by WOOD to LEONARD , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which those two men profited . All four are now out of baseball . Cons and SPEAKER parted company with their clubs mysteriously at the end of the season of 1926 . They had been tremendously popular with patrons of the game . LEONARD had been hostile to COBB after being dropped in 1925 from the Detroit club . 14EONARD , living in California , has declined to be examined by Commissioner LANDIS at Chicago , but COBB , SPEAKER and WOOD appeared at a hearing the other day in that city . Coss declared that he had had no talk in Detroit with SPEAKER about the game to be played on Sept. 25 . Both Cosa and SPEAKER denied that they had talked with LEONARD " under the grand stand " about a " frame-up " game the next day . WOOD made an ugly statement at the hearing : that it was not uncommon for players to bet on games , even in the middle of the season . COBB gave corroborative testimony on this point . He knew that LEONARD was going to " put doWn " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago yes- terday COBB said that he and SPEAKER had tried to bring up the case long ago " to clear our names of suspicion . " It is In COBB 'S favor that he has ' made a considerable fortune by legitimate playing . SPEAKER 'S reputation has alliways been good . COBB admits that betting was common among ball players during the seasons prior to the 11919 scandal , Whatever the facts ' about LEONARD 'S charges may be , baseball is again on trial , but it can hardly be said that it is under grave suspicion at the present time . Commissioner LANDIS is paid a large salary to keep the game clean . Baseball is again on trial if for no other reason than the peculiar concealment of the Leonard charges for seven years . The Commissioner should inquire into it . Furthermore , for the future of baseball there should be a decision on the Leonard charges , a judgment in the case , without delay .                   @ @
