T. S. Eliot / HAVE spoken of the similarity between the English seventeenth-century poets and the French nineteenth-century Symbolists . The poetry of T. S. Eliot has , in our own time , brought together these two traditions , as it is Eliot who , so ' far as I know , has for the first time called attention , in his criticism , to the affinity between them . " The ' form , " he says , " in which I began to write , in 1908 or 1909 , was directly drawn from the study of La'forgue together with the later Elizabethan drama ; and I do not know anyone who started from exactly that point . " I have so far , in discussing the early Symbolists , spoken chiefly of Mallarm ? . But T. S. Eliot derived , as he indicates , from a different branch of the Symbolist tradition . In 1873 , there had appeared in Paris a book of poems called " Les Amours Jaunes , " by a man who called himself Tristan Corbiere . " Les Amours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a year afterwards the writer died of consumption . Only thirty at the time of his death , Tristan Corbiere , the son of a sea captain who had himself written sea stories , had been an eccentric maladjusted man : a born writer , with a good education , he bad suffered from , at the same time that he hadboasted of , his ugliness and unsociability , sleeping in Paris during the day , spending the nights in the cafes or at his verses , and at dawn greeting the Paris harlots as they emerged from the station house or the hotel with the same half-harsh , half-tender fellow-feeling for the alien to conventional society which , when at home in his native Brittany , caused him to escape the house of his family and seek the company . of the customs-men and the sailors of the port ? living skeleton and invalid as he was , performing prodigies of courage and endurance in the navigation of a little cutter which he sailed by preference in the worst possible weather . Melancholy , with a feverishly active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to amuse himself by going about in convict 's clothes and , on one occasion , on a visit to Rome , appeared in the streets in evening dress , wearing a miter on his head and leading a pig decorated with ribbons . And Corbi ? re 's poetry was a poetry of the outlaw : often colloquial and homely , yet with a rhetoric of fantastic slang ; often with the manner of slapdash doggerel , yet sure of its own morose artistic effects ; fuls of the parade of romantic personality , yet incessantly humiliating itself with a self-mockery scurrilous and savage , from which , as Huysmans said , would break without warning " a cry of sharp pain , like the breaking of a ' cello string " ? Corbiere 's verse brought back into French poetry qualities which had been quite foreign to its spirit since the time of Villon . So outlandish , in fact , did Corbiere appear even from the Romanticist point of view , that he was put down , when he was thought of at all , as not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1884 , paid tribute to him in a series of articles , " Les Poetes Maudits , " which was one of the important critical events in the development of Symbolism . Verlaine himself , a more accomplished artist , but a less original and interesting personality , had been strongly influenced by " Les Amours Jaunes " ? he seems , indeed , to have caught over from Corbiere , not merely certain artistic effects , but even something of his own poetic personality , his peculiar accent of wistful na ? vet ? : compare Corbiere 's " Rondels pour Apres " with Verlaine 's sonnet which begins " L'espoir luit comme un brin de paille dans l'etable " ; or " Paria " with " Casper Hauser . " But there was another French poet besides Verlaine who carried on the tradition of Corbiere , and who is more closely allied to him than Verlaine . Jules Laforgue , nineteen years younger than Corbiere , like him tubercular , and dead at twenty-seven , further developed and , at that later date , had much greater immediate success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ve , of which Corbiere seems to have been the inventor , The son of a schoolmaster , Laforgue , for all his nonchalance in handling rudely the conventions of French poetry , is more a professional man of letters than Corbiere . He even errs through preciosity in his fashion : what with Corbiere seems a personal and inevitable , if eccentric , manner of speech , in Jules Laforgue seems self-conscious and deliberate , almost sometimes a literary exercise . His gentleness and wistfulness are those of a sick well-cared-for child ; his asperities , his surprising images , his coquetries , his cynicism , and his impudence , are those of a spoiled clever schoolboy . Yet Laforgue is a very fine poet and one of the most remarkable of the Symbolists . He and Corbiere had brought to Symbolism a new variety of vocabulary and a new complexity of feeling . With Ma'Janne , it may be said that , on the whole , it is the imagery , not the feeling , which is complex : Mallarme , though sometimes playful , is classical in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he sustains a certain grandeur of tone . But it is from the conversational-ironic , rather than from the high esthetic , tradition of Symbolism that T. S. Eliot derives . Corbiere and Laforgue are almost everywhere in his early work . The emphatic witty quatrains of Corbiere , with their sudden lapses into tenderness or pathos , are heard again in the satiric poems of Eliot : a poem like " Mr. Eliot 's Sunday Morning Service " would hardly , one imagines , have been written without Corbiere 's " Rapsode Foraine . " And as " Conversation Galante " derives clearly // from certain poems in Laforgue 's " Les Cornplaintes " and " L'Imitation de Notre-Dame la Lune , " so the more elaborate " Portrait of a Lady " and " The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock " follow closely the longer poems of Laforgue . Compare the conclusion of " Mr. Prufrock " with the conclusion of the early version of Laforgue 's poem " Legende " : Here it will be seen that Eliot has reproduced Laforgue 's irregular metrical scheme almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's poem ? the hesitations and constraints of a man either too timid or too disillusioned to make love to a woman who provokes his ironic pity at the same time that she stirs bursts of stifled emotion ? has a strong resemblance to the subjects of " Mr. Pruf rock " and the " Portrait of a Lady . " And in another poem , " La Figlia the Piange , " Eliot has adapted a line of Laforgue 's " Simple et sans foi comme un bonjour " ? " Simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand . " He has even brought over into English some of the unstressed effect of French verse : how different , for example , is the alexandrine just quoted from the classical English alexandrine , " Which like a wounded snake drags Its slow length along , " or " With sparkless ashes loads an unlamented urn . " It must not be supposed , however , that Eliot is. not original or that he is not the equal of either of his masters . Those longer poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of more fragmentary and less mature work are certainly his most interesting and successful productions : their metrical flexibility and their fidelity to the pathetic-ironic , worldly-esthetic moods of the fin de sikle temperament were a new artistic achievement in French poetry . Yet , though Eliot has , in certain obvious respects , applied Laforgue 's ' formula so consistently , he can not be described as an imitator because he is in some ways a superior artist . He is more mature than Laforgue ever was , and his workmanship is perfect in a way that Corbiere 's and Laforg-ue 's rarely were . T. S. Eliot 's peculiar distinction lies , as Clive Bell has said , in his " phrasing . " Lalorgue 's images are often far-fetched and inappropriately grotesque : his sins in this respect are really very closely akin to those of the English metaphysical poets ; but Eliot 's taste is absolutely sure ? his images always precisely right . And the impression that EliOt leaves , even in these earliest poems , is clear , vivid and unforgettable : we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we find him , as in " Gerontion , " writing in the rhythms of late Elizabethan blank-verse , we associate him with Middleton or Webster . When we come to examine Eliot 's themes , we recognize first something which we have found already in Laforgue , but which appears in Eliot in a more intense form . One of the principal preoccupations of Flaubert ? a great hero of Eliot 's , as of Eliot 's fellow-poet , Ezra Pound ? had been the inferiority of the present to the past : the Romantics had discovered the possibilities of historical imagination ; with their thirst for magnificence and grandeur , they had located these qualities in past societies ? they had turned habitually to Greece and Rome , to the Middle Ages , to the Renaissance . And Flaubert , with all the Romantic appetite for the glorious , the gorgeous , the exalted , constraining himself to the Naturalist 's confrontation of the actual nineteenth-century world in which he lived , pursued two parallel lines of fiction which lent significance and relief to each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salammb8 " and in " La Tentation de Saint-Antoine , " the splendid barbarities of the pagan world and the heroic piety of the early Christian ; and , on the other , he caricatured , in " Madame Bovary , " in " L'Education Sentimentale " and in " Bouvard et Pecuchet , " the pusillanimity and mediocrity of contemporary bourgeois France . This whole point of view of Rauberes ? particularly pointed in " Trois Coates , " where the three periods are contrasted in one book ? was destined profoundly to affect modern literature . IVe shall encounter it later on in Joyce ; but in the meantime we must note its reappearance in the poetry of Eliot . Eliot , like Flaubert , feels at every turn that human life in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries has become ignoble , sordid or tame , and he is haunted and tormented by intimal dons that it has once been otherwise . In " Burbank with a Baedeker : Bleistein with a Cigar , " the young American tourist in Venice , superseded in his affair with the Princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clipped wings and pared claws of the Lion of St. Mark 's , the symbol of the old arrogant opulent Venice and of the age when such a city was possible ; in " A Cooking Egg , " the poet asks himself , during a call upon a very mild , dull spinster : " Where are the eagles and the trumpets ? " and returns the saddened answer , " Buried beneath some snow-deep Alps . " In " Lune " de Miel , " the Middle Western American travelers , stifled with the summer heat and devoured by the bed-bugs of Ravenna , are contrasted with the noble crumbling beauty of the old Byzantine church less than a league away , of which they are unaware and to which they have no relation ; and in " Mr. Eliot 's Sunday Morning Service , " the modern clergymen and their arid creed are contrasted with the fresh religious feeling of a picture of the baptism of Christ by " a painter of the Umbrian school . " In the best and most effective of these poems , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drowsy , idiotic and mildly sinister scene in some low dive , where two of the girls are supposed to be plotting against one of the men , remembers , at the sound of nightingales singing , the murder of Agamemnon in Aeschylus : But another theme emerges in Eliot 's poetry , a theme as little characteristic of French as it is of English literature ? the theme of sterility , of emotional starvation . T. S. Eliot , though born in St. Louis , comes of New England stock and was educated at Harvard ; and he is in some ways a typical product of the New England civilization . He has all of the Puritan fastidiousness , scrupulousness , prudence and preoccupation with moral questions ; and one of the principal subjects of his poetry is that regret at situations unexplored , that dark rankling of passions inhibited , which has figured so conspicuously in the work of the American writers of New England and New York from Hawthorne to Edith Wharton . T. S. Eliot , in this respect , has much in common with Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portrait of a Lady , " with their helpless sadness at having dared too little , correspond exactly to the middle-aged heroes of " The Ambassadors " and " The Beast in the Jungle , " realizing sadly too late in life that they have lived too cautiously and too poorly . The fear of life , in Henry James , is closely bound up with the fear of vulgarity . And Eliot , also , fears vulgarity ? which he embodies in his symbolic figure of " Apeneck Sweeney " ? at the same time that he is fascinated by it . Yet he chafes at the limitations and pretenses of the culture represented by Boston ? a society " quite uncivilized , " as he says , " but refined beyond the point of civilization . " He has some amusing satiric poems about old New England ladies , and he meditates , as he walks the Boston streets , on his way to call on his Cousin Harriet , how And the " Portrait of a Lady , " whether the scene be laid in Boston or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society " refined beyond the point of civilization " : from the Lady , who serves tea among lighted candles ? " an atmosphere of Juliet 's tomb " ? with her dispiriting combination of culture with flattery and flirtation ? her slightly stale and faded gush about Chopin and her memories of Paris in the spring ? the poet is seized with a desire to flee : But with his incurable moral scrupulousness , he adds : Are these ideas right or wrong ? So Mr. Prufrock in the room where asks himself , But the most complete expression of this aspect of Eliot 's nature is to be found in the later and longer poem called " The Waste Land " ( 1922 ) . The Waste Land of the poem is a symbol borrowed from the myth of the Holy Grail : it is a desolate and sterile country ruled by an impotent king , in which not only have the crops ceased to grow and the animals to reproduce , but the very human inhabitants have become incapable of having children . But the first thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sterile side of the Puritan temperament . On the first pages we find again the theme of the girl with the hyacinths ? themselves a symbol for the rearisen god of the fertility rites , who will save the rainless country from drouth ? which has already figured in " La Figlia the Piange " and " Dans le Restaurant " ? a memory which apparently represents for the poet some fulfillment foregone in youth and now agonizingly desired ; and in the last pages it is repeated . We recognize throughout " The Waste Land " the peculiar conflicts of the Puritan turned artist : the horror of vulgarity and the shy sympathy with the common life , the ascetic shrinking from sexual experience and the distress at the drying up of the springs of sexual emotion , with the straining after a religious emotion which can be made to take its place . Yet though Eliot 's spiritual and intellectual roots are still more firmly fixed in New England than is , I believe , ordinarily understood , there is in " The Waste Land " something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undernourished youth . The colonization by the Puritans of New England was merely an incident in that rise of the middle class which has brought a commercial-industrial civilization to the European cities as well as to the American ones . T. S. Eliot now lives in London and has become an English citizen ; but the desolation , the esthetic and spiritual drouth , of Anglo-Saxon middle-class society oppresses London as well as Boston . The terrible dreariness of the great modern cities is the atmosphere in which " The Waste Land " takes place ? amidst this dreariness , brief , vivid images emerge , brief pure moments of feeling are distilled ; but all about us we are aware of nameless millions performing barren office routines , drying up their souls in interminable labors of which the products never bring them profit people whose pleasures are so vulgar and so feeble that they seem almost sadder than their pains . And this Waste Land has another aspect : it is a place not merely of desolation , but of anarchy and doubt . In our post-War world of shattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer seems serious or coherent ? all that we do is half . hearted at best and for a good deal that we are obliged to ' do we have no heart at all . The poet of " The Waste Land " is living half the time in the real world of contemporary London and half the time in the haunted wilderness of the medieval legend . The water for which he longs in the twilight desert of his dream is to quench the spiritual thirst which torments him in the London dusk ; and as Ge.rontion , " an old man in a dry month , " thought of the young men who had fought in the rain , as Prufrock fancied riding the waves with mermaids and lingering in the chambers of the sea , as Mr. Appolinax has been imagined drawing strength from the deep sea-caves of coral islands ? so the poet of " The Waste Land , " making water the symbol of all freedom , all fecundity and flowering , of the soul , invokes an April shower of his youth , the song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the vision of a drowned Phoenician sailor , sunk beyond " the cry of gulls and the deep sea swell , " who has at least died by water , not thirst . The poet , who seems now to be traveling in a country cracked by drouth , can only feverishly dream of these things . One 's head may be well stored with literature ? but the heroic prelude of the Elizabethans has ironic echoes in modern London streets and modern London drawing-rooms : lines remembered from Shakespeare turn to jazz or associate themselves with the sound of phonographs . And now it is one 's personal regrets again ? the girl in the hyacinth-garden ? " the awful daring of a moment 's surrender which an age of prudence can never retract " ? the key which turned once , and once only , in the prison of inhibition and isolation . Now he stands on the arid plain again , and the dry-rotted world of London seems to be crumbling about him ? the poem ends in a medley of quotations from the literatures of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinherited ; like the author of the " Pervigilium Veneris , " he is dumb and asks himself when he shall ever be able to sing ; like Arnaut Daniel , in Dante , as he disappears in the refining fire , he begs the world to raise a prayer for his torment . " These fragments I have stored against my ruins . " " The Waste Land , " in method as well as in mood , has left Laforgue far behind . Eliot has developed a new technique , at once laconic , swift and precise , for representing the transmutations of thought , the interplay of perception and reflection . Dealing with subjects complex in the same way as those of Yeats 's poem " Among School-Children " and Valery 's " Cimetiere Marin , " Eliot brings to them a different technique . As May Sinclair has written of Eliot , his " trick of cutting his corners and his curves makes him seem obscure when he is clear as daylight . His thoughts move very rapidly and by astounding cuts . They move not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as live thoughts move in live brains . " Let us examine , as an illustration , the lovely nightingale passage from " The Waste Land . " Eliot is describing a room in London : That is , the poet sees , above the mantel , a picture of Philomela being changed to a nightingale , and it gives his mind a moment 's swift release . The picture is like a window opening upon Milton 's earthly paradise ? the " sylvan scene , " as Eliot explains in a note , is a phrase from " Paradise Lost "  - -  and the poet associates his own plight in the modern city , in which some " infinitely gentle , infinitely suffering thing , " to quote one of Eliot 's earlier poems , is somehow being done to death , with Philomela , raped and mutilated by Tereus . But in the earthly paradise , there had been a nightingale singing ? Philomela had wept her woes in song , though the barbarous king had cut out her tongue , and with a beauty inviolable . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myth to his present situation : The song of birds was represented , in old English popular poetry , by such outlandish syllables as " jug jug " ? so Philomela 's cry sounds to the vulgar . Eliot has here , in seven lines of extraordinary liquidity and beauty , fused the picture , the passage from Milton and the legend from Ovid , into a single moment of vague poignant longing . " The Waste Land " is dedicated to Ezra Pound , to whom Eliot elsewhere acknowledges a debt . And he has here evidently been influenced by Pound 's " Cantos " : " The " Waste Land , " like the " Cantos , " is fragmentary in form and packed with literary quotation and allusion . In fact , the passage just discussed above bears a resemblance to a passage on the same subject ? the Philomela-Procne myth ? at the beginning of Pound 's Fourth Canto . And we must now touch upon this addiction to literary quotation and reference which Eliot shares with Pound . Jules Laforgue had sometimes parodied , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his early poetry , introduced phrases from Shakespeare and Blake for purposes of ironic effect . He has always , also , been very much given to prefacing his poems with quotations , and , as I have indicated , to echoing other poets . But now , ih " The Waste Land , " he carries this tendency to what one would suppose must be Its extreme possible limit : here , in a poem of only 403 lines , reinforced with seven pages of notes , he manages to include quotations from , allusions to , or imitations of , at least thirty-five different writers ( some of them , such as Shakespeare and Dante , laid under contribution several times ) ? to say nothing of popular songs ; and to introduce passages in six foreign languages , including Sanskrit . And we must also take into consideration that the idea of the literary medley itself seems to have been borrowed from yet another writer , Pound . We are always being dismayed , in our general reading , to discover that lines which at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creations of Eliot had been taken over or adapted from other writers ? ( sometirnes very unexpected ones : thus , it appears now , from Eliot 's essay on Bishop Andrewes , that the first five lines of " The Journey of the Magi , " as well as the " word within a word , unable to speak a word , " of " Gerontion , " have been borrowed from Andrewes 's sermons ; and the " stiff dishonoured shroud " of " Sweeney Among the Nightingales " seems to be an echo of the " dim dishonoured brow " of Whittier 's poem about Daniel Webster . ) One would be inclined a priori to predict that all this load of erudition and literature would be enough to sink any writer , and that such a production as " The Waste Land , " at best , must be a work of second-hand inspiration . And it is true that , in reading Eliot and Pound , we are sometimes visited by uneasy recollections of Ausonius , in the fourth century , composing Greek-and-Latin macaronies and mosaic-poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most effective precisely , in " The Waste Land , " where he might be expected to be least original ? he succeeds in conveying his meaning , in communicating his emotion , in spite of all his learned or mysterious allusions , and whether we understand them or not . There is a curious contrast in this regard between Eliot and Pound . Pound 's work has been partially sunk by its cargo of erudition , whereas Eliot , in ten years ' time , has left upon English poetry an impression perhaps more striking than any other poet writing English . It is , in fact , probably true at the present time that Eliot is being praised too extravagantly and Pound , though he has deeply influenced a few , on the whole unfairly neglected . I should explain Eliot 's greater popularity by the fact that , for all his fragmentary method , he possesses a complete literary personality in a way that Pound ' does not . Ezra Pound , fine poet though he is , does not dominate us like a master imagination ? he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of art . It is true that Pound , for all his inveterate translating , is a man of genuine originality ? but his heterogeneous shorter poems , and the heterogeneous passages which go to make his longer poems , never seem to come together in a whole ? as his general prose writing , apart from his poetry , gives expression to all sorts of ideas , all sorts of enthusiasms and prejudices , some ridiculous and some valid , some learned and some half-baked , which , though exceedingly valuable to his generation as polemic , as propaganda and as illuminating casual criticism , do not establish , maintain and develop a distinct reasoned point of view as Eliot 's prose-writings do . T. S. Eliot has thought coherently and ' deeply about the relations between the different phases of human experience , and his passion for proportion and order is reflected in his poems . Eliot is , in his way , a complete man , and if it is true that he has himself accomplished what he has credited Ezra Pound with accomplishing ? if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that he has been able to lend even to the rhythms , to the words themselves , of his great predecessors a new music and a new meaning ? it is this intellectual completeness and soundness which has given his rhythm its special prestige . And I want to suggest that another cause which may contribute to Eliot 's extraordinary success is his possession of a dramatic instinct . We may be puzzled by Eliot 's continual preoccupation with the question of the possibilities of a modern poetic ' drama ? that is to say , a modern drama in verse . Why , we wonder , should he worry about drarna in verse ? why , after the age of Ibsen , Shaw and Tchekov , should he prefer plays in verse to plays in prose ? Then we recognize that Eliot ? himself is essentially a dramatic poet . Mr. Prufrock and Sweeney are characters as none of the personages of Pound , Valery or Yeats is ? they have become a part of our modern mythology . And most of the best of Eliot 's poems are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " especially , I believe , owes a large part of its power to its dramatic quality , which makes it peculiarly effective read aloud . Eliot has even published recently in The Criterion two fragments of rather a promising play in a sort of jazz dramatic meter which suggests certain scenes in John Howard Lawson 's " Processional . " At any rate , that first handful of Eliot 's poems , brought out in the middle of the War ( 1917 ) and generally read , if at all , at the time , as some sort of modern vers de soci ? te , was soon found , as Wyndham Lewis has said , to have had the effect of a little musk that scents up a whole room . And been made to reproduce it ? by Aldington , Nancy Cunard , etc. ? at least a dozen times . And , as Eliot , lately out of Harvard , assumed the role of the middle-aged Prufrock and today , at forty , in one of his latest poems , " The Song of Simeon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty years and no tomorrow " ? so " Gerontion " and " The Waste Land " have made the young poets old before their time . In London , as in New York , and in the universities both here and in England , they for a time took to inhabiting exclusively barren beaches , cactus-grown deserts , and dusty attics overrun by rats -- the only properties they allowed themselves to play with were an occasional fragment of shattered glass or a sparse sprinkling of old broken bones , They had purged themselves of Masefield as of Shelley , for dry tongues and rheumatic joints . The modern city now seemed very horrible to poets who had always lived in the country ; and , in the case of poets who lived in the city , the jazz they had once enjoyed now filled them with horror and despair , But in this case , we can forgive the young for growing prematurely decrepit : where even some of the finest intelligences of the elder generation read " The Waste Land " with blankness or laughter , the young had recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupies today a position of distinction and influence equal in importance to his position as a poet . His writings have been comparatively brief and rare ? he has published only four small books of criticism ? yet he has probably affected literary opinion , during the period following the War , more profoundly than any other critic writing English . Eliot 's prose style has a kind of felicity different from that of his poetic style : it is almost primly precise and sober , yet with a sort of sensitive charm in its austerity -- closely reasoned and making its points with the fewest possible words , yet always even , effortless and lucid . In a reaction against the impressionistic criticism which flourished at the end of the century and which has survived into our own time ? the sort of criticism which , in dealing with poetry , tries to reproduce its effect by having recourse to poetic prose ? T. S. Eliot has attempted a kind of scientific study of esthetic values : avoiding impressionistic rhetoric and a priori esthetic theories alike , he compares works of literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects and the different degrees of satisfaction to be derived from them . We sometimes follow his literary criticism with the same sort of eagerness and excitement with which we follow a philosophical inquiry . And by this method , T. S. Eliot has done more than perhaps any other modern critic to effect a revaluation of English literature . Professor Saints-bury has played in literature much the same sort of role that he has played as a connoisseur of wines , that of an agreeable and entertaining guide of excellent taste and enormous experience ; Edmund Gosse , often intelligent and courageous in dealing with French or Scandinavian writers , always appeared , when it came to English literature , a little the Librarian of the House of Lords ? that is , always a little like a British Beef-Eater guarding the Crown jewels in the Tower of London ; and Paul Elmer More has been a moralist with little esthetic appreciation of literature . But T. S. Eliot , as an American , approaching English literature with an American 's peculiar combination of avidity and detachment and with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient and modern , of the Continent , has been ab ! e to succeed as few critics have done in the excessively difficult task of considering English , Irish and American writers in relation to one another , and writers in English in relation to Continental writers . Eliot 's criticism has had the effect , to an extraordinary degree , of discrediting the cliches of the text-books , and is even by way of establishing in the minds of the youngest generation a new system of literary clich ? s . With the ascendancy of T. S. Eliot , the Elizabethan dramatists have come back into fashion , and the nineteenth-century poets gone out . Milton 's poetic reputation has sunk , and Dryden 's and Pope 's have risen . It is as much as one 's life is worth nowadays , among young people , to say an approving word for Shelley or a doubtful word about Donne . And as for the enthusiasm for Dante ? to paraphrase the man in Hemingway 's novel , there 's been nothing like it since the Fratellinis I Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his influence has been salutary . Like Paul Valery , Eliot believes that a work of art is not an oracular outpouring , but an object which has been con-structed deliberately with the aim of producing a certain effect . He has brought back to English criticism something of that trenchant rationalism which he admires in the eighteenth century , but with a much more Catholic appreciation of different styles and points of view than the eighteenth century allowed . The Romantics fare badly before this criticism . Vague sentiment vaguely expressed , rhetorical effusion justifying bad art ? these Eliot hao coldly discouraged , For him , Byron is " a disorderly ' mind , and an uninteresting one " ; Keats and Shelley " not nearly such great poets as they are supposed to be " ; whereas the powers of Dryden are " wider , but no greater than those of Milton . " Eliot is sometimes a little pedantic in his scorn for romantic carelessness and gush . In a recent essay on Richard Crashaw , he has confessed , with a certain superciliousness , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Skylark , " provoking thereby , in the English press , a number of letters from correspondents indignantly eager to explain it to him . And , indeed , though Shelley is often vague , is he any vaguer than a Symbolist poet ? ? than Laforgue or Mallarme ? He is simply vague in a different way . And , though Shelley abuses a certain vocabulary , does not Laforgue abuse his as badly ? " For the first time perhaps , " writes Eliot , " in verse of such eminence , sound exists without sense . " Is this true ? Or rather , is it not true that " sense " and " sound " are pretty difficult to consider separately ? What is the " sense " of a poem ? Is it not merely the effect which it produces ? ? and does not the effect depend upon sound ? Shelley , aimed at a vague musical effect , but so did the Symbolists ? and they had their own way of cheating on the " sense " ? of following the line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things which has distinguished the Symbolist from the Romantic movement has been an insistence upon intellectual discipline ; yet Eliot has tended to overdo it in bringing into play this eighteenth-century common-sense to defend the Symbolists and the " metaphysical " poets against the Romantics : in the eighteenth century , after all , that kind of commonsense , if it fought the Romantics who were to drive it out of fashion , had cut also the other way against precisely those metaphysical poets who had preceded it . ( It isperhaps worth noting , by the way , how closely T. S. Eliot 's anti-Romanticism , stimulated first , it may be , by Babbitt at Harvard , seems to have been paralleled , in a recent incident , by Paul Valery 's point of view : Valery lately delivered a lecture in which , defending the intelligibility of his own verse , he asserted that he was unable to understand the well known lines from Alfred de Musset : and challenged one of the gentlemen in the audience , who had exclaimed that Valery must be joking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet a reaction against the degeneration , the decomposition , of Romanticism which has been taking place in certain quarters in our own time , was inevitable and necessary . And there is also a romanticist criticism : the critic seizes upon a work of literature , and makes it a pretext for writing indirectly about his own personality and emotions . This tendency Eliot has done much to check , and in doing so , on the whole has done well ? though he sometimes errs in the opposite direction by seeming to talk as if the critical discussion of a given work of literature could , in the last analysis , be anything but interpretative ? as if it were possible to determine the properties of a novel or a poem as one can the properties of a chemical element ( is it not even extremely doubtful whether we do not " interpret " the atoms themselves ? ) . Let us consider , in this connection , a characteristic discussion of Shakespeare from Eliot's. essay on " Shakespeare and the Stoicism of Seneca . " " It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chief reasons for questioning Mr. Strachey 's Shakespeare , and Mr. Murry 's , and Mr. Lewis 's , is the remarkable resemblance which they bear to Mr. Strachey , and Mr. Murry , and Mr. Lewis respectively . I have not a very clear idea of what Shakespeare was like . But I do not conceive him as very like either Mr. Strachey , or Mr. Murry , or Mr. ' Wyndham Lewis , or myself . " Then , however , Eliot goes on to set forth a view of the dying speeches of Shakespeare 's tragic heroes ? those final flares in which , self-undone , they invoke their forfeited nobility or bravery ? which would put them in a light , not merely ironic , but almost comic , and make them resemble very closely Mr. Prufrock and the " broken Coriolanus " of " The Waste Land " : they are " cheering themselves up , " they are " endeavoring to escape reality . " And Eliot has recently , writing in protest against the fin ' de siecle Baudelaire of Arthur Symons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the later T. S. Eliot . Yet , Eliot , in spite of the extreme positions which the extreme champions of opposite positions have sometimes driven him to resort to , is not by any means unintelligent or unappreciative in regard , for example , to Keats and Shelley , or even in regard to Swinburne , a much worse example of the kind of thing he distrusts ; and he has disarmed anyone who would charge him with dogmatism by introducing his essay on " The Perfect Critic " with a quotation from Remy de Gourmont : " If a man is sincere , his great effort is to set up his personal impressions as laws . " The literary atmosphere since the War has in general been rather an Alexandrian one . In France , the old nineteenth-century criticism , represented by Sainte-Beuve or Taine , which did not differ much in some ways from nineteenth-century French novel-writing , has been replaced by a new kind of philosophical criticism , of which perhaps the most eminent practitioner is Albert Thibaudet , which deals almost exclusively in abstractions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herbert Read and I. A. Richards ? and they have also another type of criticism , of which the most brilliant representatives are Lytton Strachey and Virginia Woolf ? a sort of tasting of books and personalities , which discriminates nicely between them , but does not particularly prefer one to another : one is supposed to have read everything and enjoyed everything and to understand exactly the reasons for one 's enjoyment , but not to enjoy anything excessively nor to raise an issue of one kind of thing against another . There is something in T. S. Eliot of the pedantries of both these types of criticism . He is very much given , for example , to becoming involved in a sort of literary House-that-Jack-Built : " We find this quality occasionally in Wordsworth , " he will write , " but it is a quality which Wordsworth shares with Shenstone rather than with Collins and Gray . And properly to appreciate Shenstone , we must read his prose as well as his verse . By his ' Essays on Men and Manners , ' Shenstone attaches himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Rochefoucauld and ( with his wider range ) La Bruyere ; and we shall do well to read enough of Theophrastus to understand the kind of effect at which La Bruy ? re aimed . ( Professor Somebody-or-other 's book on Theophrastus and the Peripatetics ' will help us to understand the intellectual atmosphere in which Theophrastus wrote and to appreciate the influences on his work , very ' different from one another , of Plato and . Aristotle . " ) At this rate ( though I have parodied Eliot ) , we should have to read the whole of literature in order to enjoy a single book . If it was true of the romantic and impressionistic critics that they often made their subjects a present of all sorts of emotions and visions which they had drawn primarily from their own imaginations ; it is also true , on the other hand , of the criticism since the War that it sometimes seems to deprive its subject of something . If the former invested his subject with an adventitious mystery and glamor , the latter tends to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When , however , we consider Eliot 's criticism against this background of the criticism of his time , we are aware chiefly of his intense enthusiasm , as well as of his real humility and his willingness to pursue his inquiries till they reach those regions where all principles are doubtful and whence all conclusions must appear unsure . Nor can Eliot 's criticism any longer be reproached , as it has sometimes been in the past , with detaching literature from the rest of life and discussing it as if it could be dealt with in vacuo . The chief aim of his most recent book of essays , " For Lancelot Andrewes " ( 1928 ) , seems to be to indicate the relation of his literary views to his views on other subjects : politics , religion and morals ? a relation which had not been made clear in his earlier volume of literary essays , " The Sacred Wood " ( 1920 ) . Eliot now declares himself , not merely a classicist in literature , but in religion an Anglo-Catholic and in politics a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " one recognizes , again , something familiar but hardly English , in spite of Eliot 's Anglo-Catholicism and royalism . It is the New Englander 's preoccupation with morals and his deep conviction of the sinfulness of man : Eliot admires Machiavelli because Machiavelli assumes the baseness of human nature as an unalterable fact ; and he looks for light to the theologians who propose salvation , not through political or social reform , but only through " grace . " Eliot apparently today regards " Evil " as some sort of ultimate fact , which it is impossible either to analyze or to correct . But from certain points of view , as I was suggesting , there is little in common between T. S. Eliot and the seventeenth-century English divines , as he describes them and gives us samples from their sermons . Bramhall and Andrewes have a certain richness , exist in a certain humid saturated atmosphere where even monumental outlines are blurred ; whereas Eliot is more narrow , more colorless , more relentless , more clear . He has his own sort of graciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little thin-lipped . Nor is this merely a difference , I believe , between seventeenth-century prose and the prose of our own time . There is something of the Puritan theologian in Eliot ; and this strain , at the same time that it may , in one sense , have had the effect of blighting his poetry , of preventing it from flowing very freely , is also probably , it seems to me , one of the causes of its intensity and richness . The stream , as the channel narrows , runs deeper , and in the waste land , tastes peculiarly , sweet .
