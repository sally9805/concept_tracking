WHEN TO Mani BONDS In a letter to clients , W. J. Noonan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calls attention to the policy of a man who buys investments for one of the big insurance companies , as follows : " The time to buy bonds is when we have the money to buy with . Our experience has been that that is best . There was a time some years ago when we used to attempt to follow the fluctuations of the bond market  --  to buy heavily when we thought bonds were cheap and to stop buying almost entirely when it looked to us as though prices were high . We stopped all that long ago because we found it did n't pay  --  for one thing , the interest we lost on our uninvested money more than made up for the slight advantage in price which we were able to gain . Usually , moreover , there were n't any price advantages . Likely as not , the bond market softened up after we had been doing a lot pf buying and became firm at a time ' when we had a lot of money and wanted to put it out . " Mr. Noonan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance company is not greatly different from that of the individual investor . " Lt seems , " he remarks , " especially obvious in a bond market such as the present , when fluctuations are of a purely minor character , that investors have nothing to gain by holding off in the hope of buying at substantially lower prices within a reasonable time .
