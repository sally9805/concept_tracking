A girl usher said she saw a man enter and go to the projection room , but this man , she was sure , left In about five minutes . ' It was dark and she could not identify the man . Blow Dealt " to the Alibi . Last night Hoffman 's alibi , which had stood up well all day , was dealt a hard blow by William Taylor , manager of the Liberty Theatre , who had not been examined previously by the police .

I was in and out of the room , as usual , frequently during the afternoon . I always go there during performances to see that everything is working all right . " Told that Parker asserted that Hoffman was there all the afternoon . Taylor said : " I do not believe he was in the operators ' room with Parker that afternoon . Parker never mentioned it to me , and there was nothing wrong with the apparatus that afternoon . " Parker was off duty last night . He and Taylor will be questioned further by detectives today . Defendant Calm in Court .. Behind the arrest of Hoffman lies a story of small clues followed relentlessly by the police and , if the man is not guilty , of amazing activity on the Part of an innocent person to divert suspicion . Hoffman left hardly anything undone that would aid him if he were arrested ; yet he contends that at the time of the murder he was eleven miles away and will prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night , following seven hours of questioning by the police , Hoffman appeared in Magistrate Featherston 's court as calm and unruffled as any one of the spectators . There was not the least sign oVnervousness . The man is short and rather stocky . His complexion is dark , his features heavy . He is quite ordinary in appearance . Hia head is large and his lips somewhat thick . The new complaint was in the form of a short affidavit such as the police use and charged that " with premeditation and without justification " Hoffman shot and killed Mrs. Bauer . The affidavit was made by Detective George F. Mc- Gann " and mentioned as the informant Russell Van Name , one of the boys who found Mrs. Bauer 's body . Former Assistant District Attorney Alfred Norton of Richmond appeared for the accused man and entered the plea of not guilty . Hoffman would say nothing then or later . He is not of a talkative type . The Magistrate put the case over until Monday and coincidently notices were sent out to members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bauer ease , to reconvene on Monday . It is expected that an Monday the woman who identified Hoffman Thursday night as the man who had threatened her with a pistol , treating her in much the same way that Mrs. Bauer apparently was treated , after offering her a " lift " in his Ford sedan , will appear before the Grand Jury and tell her story . She is a married woman and the police are withholding her name for the present District Attorney Fach is expected to ask for an indictment against Hoffman charging assault on this woman so that the motion picture operator may be kept in jail for some time in any event , pending possible strengthening of the police case by connection with the killing of Mrs. Bauer . A Network of Clues . The .25 calibre automatic pistol , a holster specially ordered for it , two hats , two pairs of eye-glasses , an overcoat and the upholstery of a . Ford sedan car figure prominently in the case the po7 lice believe they have made out against Hoffman . Hoffman changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his eye-glasses after the police began looking for the man who murdered Mrs. Bauer . He also changed the upholstery of his Ford sedan and sent his .25 calibre gun to his brother , Albert eoffman , in Manhattan . He and his brother are at variance as to when the gun was sent by parcel post from Staten Island to Manhattan , it appeared yesterday . Harry Hoffman said he sent it four days after the murder . Albert Hoffman said he received the gun before the murder . The accused man admitted to the police that he burned the holster in which he carried the gun . It was this holster which really convinced the police that Hoffman was the man they were seeking , When stress was laid on the .25 calibre automatic in the newspaper accoUnts of the Bauer case , a clerk in the store of Abercrombie &; Fitch remembered that he had filled an order for a. holster for such a gun for a man on-Staten Island named " L. Rothman . " The , first holster sent was returned as of the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoffman had called at the Post Office in Port Richmond and had asked ; the very day the holster had arrived by parcel post , whether there was a package there from Abercrombie &; Fitch . He was told there was , but that it was addressed to " L. Rothman . " Hoffman was known to the postal clerk and since he was a deputy sheriff the package was turned over to him . Learning this the police traced a .25 calibre pistol to Hoffman although , when first examined two weeks ago , he bad denied owning such a weapon , but admitted possession of a pistol of larger calibre . Woman 's Story Brought Arrest . Then it was developed that the .25 had been sent to Albert Hoffman four days after the murder . This with the change of clothing and the attempt to disguise the Ford sedan caused the police to keep a sharp watch on Hoffman . The complaint of the woman who came forward with the story of assault caused the arrest of Hoffman as a material witness . Hoffman 's own story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a motion picture operator employed in the Palace Theatre in Port Richmond and lives at 92 Cottage Place . It was his day off . He drove his Ford sedan to St. George , parked it there , boarded the ferry boat and came to Manhattan . He visited a brokerage office and watched the quotation board for a while . Then walked up Broadway and Park Row , intending to get something to eat at a Chinese restaui rant . He changed his mind , however , and took an elevated train to South Ferry , returning to St. George . From St. George lie drove to Stapleton . He went to the Liberty Theatre because a new type of projecting maIchine was being used there and one of a similar character was to be installed in the Palace at Port Richmond . He wanted to see how it worked , so he leaned on his friend Parker . He sat with Parker through the afternoon shone , helping Parker once when the machine got out of order . He remained in the theatre from about 3 o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own home . He did not find any one there and , believing his wife had gone to visit her sister , drove over to the sister 's house , got his wife and returned to his own home somewhat after half past 5 . He had supper and then joined several ' other young men who constitute a jazz band . With them he went to a dance being given by the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad employes , remaining until quite late . He played in the band during the evening . The police checked this story up at all points and verified it as far as possible . Parker verified absolutely everything that Hoffman had said about his visit to the Liberty Theatre . The wife verified Hoffman 's statement as to the time " he returned home with her . The members of the jazz band verified Hoffman 's story as to how he spent the evening , slaying , too , that there was nothing at all extraordinary about his behavior or demeanor and that he did not seem in the least nervous . Thus , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , there was not a break in Hoffman 's alibi . Mrs. Bauer was killed on a lonely road estimated to be eleven miles from the Liberty Theatre in Stapleton . Going from Stapleton to his home , as Hoffman contended he did , a person would not go within many miles of the Chelsea section . Nor does there appear , as far as the police have learned , any reason whatever why Hoffman should have driven off in that direction . It already has been established that his meeting with Mrs. Bauer was wholly accidental and had the car she was driving not broken down they would not have met . The District Attorney 's Statement . District Attorney Albert Fach made this statement yesterday : " After an extended interrogation of the suspect , Hoffman , I am convinced that the circumstances attending his movements on the day that Mrs. Bauer was murdered have not been satisfactorily explained either to the Detective Bureau or myself . That Hoffman reLsembles the last male person seen in the company of Mrs. Bauer is undenied . That he is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it may have been in his possession at least two months , and that he resorted to secret means for the dual purpose of removing the gun from his physical possession , at the same time continuing the ownership of the gun in a , near relative . and this within three days after the homicide had beeen committed , all without any official suspicion attached to him , is certainly incriminating . " That changes that have taken place in the car , his desire to sell the car , the use of eyeglasses of two different styles . his admission that lay citizens had accused him of being the possible culprit and his inability to . produce proof of an alibi he advanced makes it incumbent upon me to hold bun for . the requisite period prescribed by law as one sus ' pected of having committed the homicide in question . " We have found that for $14 and an ' other gun . he , Hoffman , purchased the 1.25-calibre automatic more than two months precedingthe murder . It is singular , to say the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his possession and on his person in order to protect his family . " Hoffman nas never been charged with any crime before , so far as the police know , according to Captain Van Wagner . His reputation is wholly of a negative sore . He and Parker , the police have learned , were good friends and went about together occasionally . Mrs. Hoffman was in court yesterday . All she would say was : " I believe absolutely ? . in his innocence . I know him better than anyone else . His home life has been beyond reproach and he is a good father and husband . He would not harm anyone . It is regrettable that he should have been brought into this terrible thiivi , P
