Down a new little street in the ancient village of Thorpe-le-Soken walked the Lady Byng , last week , with a silver key in her right hand . <P> Two little boys walked on either side , one bearing a basket of bread , the other a basket of coal . At each home in the little street , first on one side , next on the other , front doors opened at the click of the silver key . Then Lady Byng flung into the hallway of each house ; first a loaf of fine white bread and next a large and sooty piece of coal . <P> This behavior , extraordinary on the part of the wife of Britain 's greatest living War hero . Viscount Byng of Vimy and of Thorpe-le-Soken , showed how striking an effect has been wrought upon Lady Byng by the fact that she very recently inherited some 750,000 ( $3,650,000 ) upon the death of a Greek uncle . ( TIME , Oct. 1 . ) <P> Already she has had rushed to completion the new little street of four-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needy and worthy tenants for only " four and six " a week ( 4 shillings , 6 pence = $1.09 ) . The ceremony of throwing bread and coals revived an old Essex custom equivalent to " house warming . " The flung loaves and chunks are supposed to bring luck and prevent occupants of the new house from ever being without food , warmth . <P> Purists rejoiced that Viscountess Byng of Vimy and of Thorpe-le-Soken possesses a silver pass key by means of which she may assure herself at any hour that the conduct of her tenants is still above reproach.
