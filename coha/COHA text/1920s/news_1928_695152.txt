txt Champ Clark , urges cotton frocks as cool and easy to look upon . On the way to the auditorium , which is yawning for the convention oratory , is something that certainly would have interested the late William Jennings Bryan . It is the " largest " ape ever captured . A Coney Island showman has rented a store and the ape is housed in the back of the shop . A sign inquires ? " Was Darwin right ? "  --  and for fifteen cents , gentlemen  --  a nickel and a dime  --  one may enter and ponder . The ape 's expression suggests a shortage of peanuts . Although fully alive to its responsibilities as host to the visiting Democrats , this Texas community has not really begun the task of dressing up for the event as yet . There are many buildings fluttering bunting , and the Reed , Smith and " dry " forces are indulging in the lithographic art , but the real chromatic glory is not scheduled until Monday . When the sun rises over Houston on that morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention will be set up . The " Gatewayto-the-World , " as the automobile plates proclaim it , will be extra well draped . Every business structure downtown , where the skyscrapers suggest the famous New York skyline , will be decorated . At night the buildings will be lighted from ground floor to roof , the Mayor having suggested this plan this morning . Determined that those who warned against Houston heat shall have an answer , the city has set out to outdo previous convention cities . Anybody who does not do his or her bit will be under the grave suspicion of lacking the traditional hospitality , and possibly may even be suspected of Republicanism . Of course , only nature can do anything about the heat , but even that has n't been so bad ? the nights are cool , which evens up for the torridity that hovers around noon . Hotels Beginning to Fill . The hotels are beginning to fill up and the lobbies are starting to become uncomfortable . It is apparent that Democracy has as many lobby politicians in its ranks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates that the Democratic gossip , who knows on the best authority just ho-v everything is going to turn out , has even more lung power and general endurance than his Republican rival . The huge convention hall , which Houston built in sixty-four days and built exceedingly well . is just about ready . Tomorrow will see the final touches put on it , and on Sunday it will be formally dedicated with Mrs. Woodrow Wilson as the guest of honor . About 12,000 persons are expected to witness the dedication , chiefly residents of the city or nearby communities . Hotel accommodations for 6,500 persons are under reservation and the Housing Committee is prepared to find quarters , in residences or apartment hotels , for 15,000 others . Members of the committee were confident today that housing facilities would prove ample . Tourist camps fringe the city , some permanent affairs and others rigged up especially for the emergency , and these will be used to care for the large transient influx of visitors which is expected . Interest in Mayor Walker , Some of the State delegations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due tomorrow , Sunday , and Monday . There is great interest here in the coming of Mayor James J. Walker . He is known here , incidentally , as the " American Prince of Wales . " W. C. T. u . Mobilizes Dry Forces . The Woman 's Christian Temperance Union has mobilized all the dry forces here and is working hard against " Al " Smith and anything but a bone-dry plank in the platform . Their quarters are aglow with placards . One shows a man swigging rum and gin , his refreshment being indicated by the litter of empty bottles at his feet . So intent on his swigging is this benighted individual that he pays scant heed to the approach of a group of healthy school children , each clasping a bottle of milk . This placard , which is strikingly done in black and red , is called " the battle of the bottles . " At the bottom is this information : " England spends fifteen shillings a week per family for beer , three shillings for milk . " In accordance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is offered in the dry headquarters daily . The prayer is not aimed against any candidate , workers said today , but is offered only that right may prevail . Among the signs in the window is : " Law makers must not be law breakers , " and " Do not fear politics ; make politics fear you . " The dry workers claim 20,000,000 women voters will vote dry , irrespective of their political faith . Horned Toads on Sale . Those horned toads which scientists dug up somewhere or other recently  --  and it is hereby hoped they are the real horned toads the scientists dug up  --  are on sale as convention souvenirs . The toads are cased in plaster boxes with glass tops and with holes for food and air . So far , the only other souvenirs on sale are walking sticks with a Democratic donkey as a handle . A cyclone fence has been put up around the Convention Hall . No , not as protection against long-winded speech makers . Merely to help keep the crowd under control . In addition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " prospective gate-crashers . " One-Eye " Connolly will be just another one to any of the lean , browned and muscular Rangers . Naturally , having put a pile of money into the Convention as an investment , merchants are counting on returns . So far , those who have gained most are dealers in seersucker , Palm Beach , and linen suits . Everybody is wearing the light suits . Newspaper men who never looked like anything but a newspaper man before are turning up looking more like Southern Planters than Southern planters look in the movies . The municipal airport is an excellent one and handy . Many delegates are scheduled to arrive by plane , and the news and picture representatives already here have quite a colony of aircraft out there now . Speaking of heat , which it is safe to do , there being no Texas Rangers in the immediate vicinity , two fashion hints for the women of the convention have been offered . Mrs. D. A. , committee woman from Oklahoma , suggests that women delegates attend sessions bareheaded . Mrs. Genevieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late
