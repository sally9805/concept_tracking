Missouri . When handsome , eloquent and often blatant Senator James A. Reed was thwarted in his presidential ambitions , he said he was through with politics-but not quite . He wanted to name his successor in the Senate . He picked a Wet named James A. Collet . He compared Candidate Collet 's opponent , a Dry named Charles Martin Hay , to Alabama 's buffoon Senator James Thomas ( " Tom Tom " ) Heflin . But Missouri voters , last week , gave Senator Reed a farewell rebuke and gave the Democratic nomination to Mr. Hay , who is neither handsome , eloquent nor blatant . In school , Mr. Hay was bright . In St. Louis , he is a lawyer . In politics , he preaches Prohibition and yet says he will support Alfred Emanuel Smith . <P> The Republicans nominated Roscoe C. Patterson to oppose Mr. Hay for Reed 's seat . <P> Kansas . Clyde Martin Reed , Republican , publisher , railroad rate expert , and Chauncey B. Little , Democrat , lawyer , were nominated for Governor . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
