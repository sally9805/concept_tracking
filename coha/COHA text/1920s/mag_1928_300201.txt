The " most valuable single contribution to airplane efficiency since the War " was the epithet that Chairman Joseph Sweetman Ames of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics last week placed upon a new form of cowl for radial air-cooled motors . The cowl , shaped like a huge bowl , fits over the cylinders back of the propeller and over the entire motor . It cuts down air resistance ; it lets a plane that can go 118 m. p. h. go 137 m. p. h. ; it saves in such case about three gallons of gasoline for every hour of flight , and it costs only $25 if put on the plane at the factory as standard equipment .
