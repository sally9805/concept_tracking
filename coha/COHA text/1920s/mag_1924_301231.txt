By way of a curtain raiser to the drama of the giants , Dr. Thomas Sewall Adams , Professor of Political Economy at Yale University , resigned from government work . The eminent economist had been employed as special adviser to the committee investigating the Internal Revenue Bureau . Writing to Senator " Jim " Watson , he said : " To probe for the sake of probing impresses me-if I may say so without offense-as a particularly demoralizing form of child 's play . " <P> He pointed out that a force of 19,000 collected $2,500,000,000 in taxes and pay $100,000,000 refunds annually , and said : <P> " Under such circumstances there must inevitably occur mistakes in judgment , instances of favoritism and sporadic cases of actual graft . The committee will have no difficulty in finding cases of each kind . But they signify nothing unless there is reason to believe that graft and favoritism are widespread and chronic in the work of the Bureau . " <P> It was almost unanimously agreed that the Professor 's remarks made perfect sense .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
