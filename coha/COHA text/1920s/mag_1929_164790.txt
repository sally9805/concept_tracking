Because Germany 's great aircraft builder Dr. Claude Dornier frankly told the right U. S. industrial leaders last spring that he needed money to expand his manufacturing plants at Friedrichshafen , General Motors ' President Alfred Pritchard Sloan last month went over to Friedrichshafen with a staff of engineers . They looked over the Dornier plant , machines and blue prints . They saw the 12-motored Do-X , which last fortnight carried 169 passengers over Lake Constance . Result was that Mr. Sloan bought for General Motors the licenses to manufacture Dornier planes in the U. S. General Motors lawyers immediately busied themselves last week , while Mr. Sloan was on his way back to the U. S. , then incorporated the Dornier Motors Aircraft Corp . of America . The company is owned jointly by General Motors and Fokker Aircraft Corp . of America . <P> That joint ownership complicates General Motors aviation activities and folds it into the entire U. S. flying fabric . Because : <P> 1 ) General Motors owns a two-fifths and so practically controlling interest in Fokker Aircraft ; 2 ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose president Harris M. Hanshue ( also Fokker 's president ) was in Manhattan last week arranging a 36-hour all-air transcontinental service with Graham Bethune Grosvenor , president of The Aviation Corp . The Aviation Corp. , through its subsidiary Universal Aviation Corp . flies from Cleveland to Kansas City . Western Air Express flies from Kansas City to Los Angeles and thence to San Francisco . The project is to extend Universal passenger services eastward to Manhattan . The two systems would transfer passengers at Kansas City . <P> Besides the Fokker Aircraft interest General Motors owns a large block of stock in Bendix Aviation Corp. , accessory manufacturers selling to the entire industry . <P> In a way General Motors ' present leaning to aviation may be considered world-spread . General Motors is the emergency reservoir whence Anthony Herman Gerard Fokker draws cash and credit for his airplane factories in Holland and nine other European countries . Last week he disembarked at England from the U. S. and hastened to Mr. Sloan 's transient London quarters . There they held a quick , pointed conference on combining European and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both continents and a centralized sales agency . Quickly after the talk Mr. Fokker left England in his private trimotored plane for a thorough inspection of European air activities . <P> An exigent early stop is Friedrichshafen where he must meet Dr. Dornier before the German leaves for Manhattan where , the middle of next month , he must confer with the directors of Dornier Corp . of America and help them get started manufacturing his monster seaplanes . At the Friedrichshafen meeting the German and the Hollander will discuss , among other practical things , the usefulness of fulfilling the promise which Dr. Dornier made last week-that next March or April he will send his huge Do-X flying across the Atlantic to demonstrate that heavier-than-air machines can be made as practical as dirigibles for such work .
