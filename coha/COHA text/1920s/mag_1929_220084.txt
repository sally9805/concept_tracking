" Trotsky is hooked up with Capitalism , and writing from Constantinople for the New York Times ! " <P> This bizarre half-truth was shrieked in Manhattan , last week , from the platform of a hall into which had jammed 5,000 men , women and children , all members or hangers-on of the Workers ' ( Communist ) Party . This group of U. S. Reds looks for leadership to the dictator of Soviet Russia , silent , ruthless Josef Stalin ; and consequently hates and fears famed Leon Trotsky , whom Stalin has booted out of Russia despite the fact that Trotsky was one of the first and greatest leaders of the Soviet Revolution , the friend of Lenin and the creator of the Soviet army . Of all the leaders of Communism , Leon Trotsky is the one least " hooked up with Capitalism , " whereas Stalin is getting into constantly better relations with the capitalist Powers . But last week Comrade Trotsky did write exclusively for the Times the story of his exile from Russia and the history of how , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late mighty founder of the Soviet State . <P> Describing his recent ejection from Russia , Leon Trotsky ( real name Lev Davidovich Bronstein ) declared that agents of Dictator Stalin appeared suddenly at Trotsky 's place of exile , Almaata , on the borders of Russian Turkestan , and informed him that he , his son and Mme. Trotsky must pack up their possessions and prepare to leave Russia . Soon all were bundled into a motor bus and since the snow was all but impassable a tractor was attached to pull the bus . Presently bus , tractor and Trotskys sank into a snowdrift . Seven hours were spent in extricating the exiles and conveying them by sledge to the nearest railway station , Pechweke Peke . <P> A special train had been provided , and so potent is the name of TROTSKY still , in Russia , that at his mere request another special train chuffed down from Moscow to meet the first , bearing two of his relatives for a family reunion . All along Comrade Trotsky had told the dictator 's agents that he " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal " order , and seemingly the agents were so perturbed by this that they stopped the Trotsky special train for 12 days amid open fields to query Moscow for further orders . Every day the engine would chuff to a neighboring village and return with food , mostly canned . Amid this interlude of perplexity , and while the empty tin cans were piling up on either side of the track , Trotsky amused himself by re-reading several works by Anatole France , famed and precious French scoffer . When , in obedience to fresh orders from Moscow , the Trotskys were booted into Turkey ( TIME , Feb. 11 ) , Comrade Trotsky sent the following note to Turkish President Mustafa Kemal Pasha : " I was brought here against my will .
