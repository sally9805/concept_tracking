Four earnest , weary , middle-aged men motored and trudged hither and yon through muddy snow of the Monongahela Valley last week . At moments they were self-important , at others selfconscious . <P> They were the U. S. Senators appointed to investigate strike conditions in bituminous Pennsylvania under the Johnson resolution ( TIME , Feb. 27 ) - Idaho 's English-born Gooding , Montana 's long-nosed Wheeler , chunky Wagner of New York ( born in Germany ) and Oklahoma 's quiet little Pine . Senator Metcalf of Rhode Island was supposed to have been with them but he fell ill . <P> The investigation began with the setting up of headquarters at the William Penn hotel in Pittsburgh . Presidents J. D. A. Morrow of the Pittsburgh Coal Co. and Horace W. Baker of the Pittsburgh Terminal Coal Co. called , to request that the Senators would make their tour without any escort from the United Mine Workers whose officials , insisted the operators , would be sure to distort conditions . Philip Murray , the Mine Workers ' vice president , was more persuasive , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the understanding that Mr. Murray was to be kept away from the operators ' superintendents at the mines . <P> The first part of the tour was dedicated to getting the strikers ' viewpoint . A tabloid newspaper 's representative was appointed official photographer . He snapped his shutter delightedly as the four dignitaries played **25;6646;TOOLONG among the dishevelled strike barracks-shaking horny hands , patting grimy little heads , listening to angry women who had lost husbands or health or unborn babies , or who complained that they had been insulted , assaulted , injured by Governor Fisher 's Coal &; Iron Police or the operator 's " scabs , " many of whom are Negroes . <P> The Senators asked about bootlegging and harlots . They smelled at drinking water and tried not to smell other moistures . They quizzed miners , both striking and strikebreaking , about wages and the cost of living , warning vigilant mine officials to keep quiet during the questioning . <P> At the Moon Run Mine , near Crafton , Pa. , it occurred to them to find out how much it actually costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. White of the Pittsburgh Coal Co. , close-lipped subordinate , refused to reveal the pertinent figures . <P> Senator Wheeler ( snappishly ) : " Do you mean to say that you refuse to answer ? " <P> Manager White : " It is n't customary to give the costs out . " <P> Senator Gooding ( with unintentional ambiguity ) : " Neither is it customary for the Senate to make an investigation of this kind . " <P> When the operators got their innings , they dressed the Senators up in mining togs and sent them riding on little cars through long , damp , dark coal galleries but continued to refuse intimate information about their businesses until it could be delivered under oath , beside Labor 's testimony , when the investigators sit in judgment .
