Once again New York counts on a new " world 's tallest building , " this time the Christian-Missionary Building , on Broadway between 122nd and 123rd St. Contracts for its foundation excavations were let last week . It will spire upward for 800 ft- " 8 ft. more than the Woolworth Building " ; will contain on the ground floor an undenominational church and a dining room seating 2,000 , above 4,500 hotel rooms which will rent for not more than $21 weekly , and on its top ( 65th ) story a hospital . Within it drinking and smoking , and possibly Sunday journals , will be forbidden . Ten percent of its earnings will go to support a medical mission at Lake Victoria Nyanza , in Africa . The builder is a realtor named Oscar E. Konkle . The site is close to those of the Union Theological Seminary , Columbia University , International House and the site of the proposed Park Avenue Baptist Church .                    @
