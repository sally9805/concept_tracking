T HE Drifter has often remarked that his esteemed colleagues know nothing of the realities of life . Occupying themselves , as they do , with public welfare , governments , social reforin , and such illusory ideas , they are unable to recognize an important event when they see it . Every so often he feels obliged to check them up on the news of the day  --  the real news  --  which they almost invariably neglect . For example , the recent bequest of the late Mr. Nathaniel Rothschild to the British Museum , although the recipients of the gift were delighted beyond measure , received not a word of comment in this paper . Yet that bequest , the largest collection of fleas in the world , was probably closer to reality than twenty governments . Mr. Rothschild had obtained specimens of fleas from almost every living animal , including no doubt the genus homo ; he is said to have financed an expedition to the Arctic regions for the sole purpose of obtaining a flea from an Arctic seal . What an opportunity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only on the part of Mr. Rothschild but of the fleas themselves , who dared Arctic cold and sunless days but who on being brought to a warmer climate , the Drifter warrants , were as sprightly in jumping about from chair to carpet and back again as any of their more tropical relatives . A GAIN , there is the story of the landlord in lower New York City who not only will not have a childless or even dogless family in his apartments , but who pays a bonus of $50 for every boy twin or triplet born on his premises and $25 for every girl . Now the Drifter is sure that if The Nation had made any comment on this matter at all , its words would have been words of praise and thanksgiving , whereas the Drifter considers this the rankest injustice that has been perpetrated for the last seven and a half years . Why any landlord should be permitted to indicate that boys are twice as valuable as girls is beyond him . Has the female sex disappeared , or is its well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suffrage and knickerbockers ? At this rate , women will shortly be as spineless and docile as men . For his part , the Drifter is willing to start the controversy by saying that if triplet boys are worth $50 , which he doubts , triplet girls are worth at least $50.98 , and , if the amount of dishwashing the poor little things will do ; while their brothers are off skylarking be taken into consideration , possibly the amount should be raised to an even $51. * C * T may be , of course , that dishwashing for females is It going out of fashion . The young lady from Illinois who holds the State record for corn-husking with eighty-fourbushels in eleven hours would probably say so , and would moreover express herself in no uncertain terms about the $25 valuation for girls mentioned above . The Drifter 's record in corn-husking , which he considers the hardest and most unworthy occupation ever invented by man , is so poor that he refuses to set it down . He feels that he would do better to challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back porch ; yet it is just possible that she , with the unhappy versatility of which women are so often possessed , might beat him at that also . THE DRIFTER Correspondence Letters to the Editor should ordinarily not exceed 500 words , and shorter communications are more likely to be printed . In any case the Editor reserves the right to abridge communications . A Voice from 1870 To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Mr. William H. Scheifley 's review of Mr. F. A. Simpson 's book ( " Louis Napoleon and the Recovery of France " ) , which appeared in The Nation of August 22 , was an agreeable surprise to me , as it revealed at last an historian who is fair to Napoleon III . Our French historians , influenced in spite of themselves and almost unconsciously by party hatreds , have generally been unjust to him ? La Gorce , like all the others . My husband alone seems to have understood Napoleon III , and spoke with courage inspired by affection for that sovereign . Between him and Emile 011ivier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep interest in the laboring classes and wished to ameliorate their material and moral condition . They differed only as to the way to bring this about . My husband held that it could be accomplished by giving them liberty , the Emperor that it could best be done through a dictatorship . But a dictatorship , even when exercised in the most upright manner , can not last long . Napoleon III finally perceived this , for as early as 1860 , after some ten years on the throne , he introduced into his constitution reforms which started the empire on a more liberal course . Emile 011ivier knew that these reforms would have a necessary complement , and as he was a liberal as well as a democrat , he did all he could to aid the Emperor , even at the risk of breaking with his party friends who were bent more on overturning the empire , notwithstanding their oath of allegiance to it , than on broadening its base and improving it . So it was that Emile 011ivier helped the Emperor get Parliament to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free speech , give more liberty to the press , etc . But the Emperor moved with circumspection in granting these reforms , for the idea of liberty seemed to frighten him , and this disposition was strengthened by the Empress and M. Rouher , his favorite minister . These two personages were in fact steering the ship of state at this moment , as the Emperor was then in very bad health , and they were not disposed to let go the rudder . But a bond of personal sympathy and an attraction arising from their similar ideas drew the sovereign and Emile 011ivier more and more closely together and finally decided the former to grant his subjects complete liberty . No other minister could have obtained from Napoleon III such a result . With Emile 011ivier as his mouthpiece , the Emperor decided , with loyalty and firmness , to establish a liberal Empire without other restrictions than those found necessary under all governments . Nor did the Emperor and his minister part company when it came to foreign affairs . They were both advocates of the doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language of today , though Emile 011ivier accepted it only when it came with the wish and . consent of the people concerned , whereas Napoleon III did not hesitate to impose it by arms if necessary . They worked for the unity of Italy in 1859 with our victorious troops , and again in 1866 by means of the Prussian armies , which , through the defeat of Austria , made possible the completion of Italian unity by the annexation of Venetia . Emile 011ivier viewed with joy the total freedom of Italy but he saw with apprehension the discontent toward Germany which showed itself in France , even among the liberals , who , like Thiers , fanned in Parliament the embers of suspicion and irritation . The Emperor did not share these feelings , but the Empress did not hide her chauvinism , the intensity of which was increased by the fact that Emile 011ivier had persuaded the Emperor to agree that so long as Prussia took no step directed against French interests , we would let the principle of nationalities develop in Germany as it pleased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prussian prince on the Spanish throne , that is , on our western frontier , was a move which threatened our safety and compelled us to demand of Prussia the abandonment of this plan . King William did so and peace seemed assured , until the Empress , requiring an inopportune guaranty for the future , gave Bismarck the chance to offend us in a way that could not be allowed to pass in silence . Hence the origin of the war of 1870 . Such are the reflections awakened in my mind by the review of Mr. Simpson 's book . MARIE THERESE OLLIVIER La Moutte , Saint-Tropez , Var , France , October 30 Marie Therese 011ivier is the widow of Emile 011ivier , Prime Minister of France at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 . ? EDITOR THE NATION . Collars for the Starving To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : The following dispatch , dated Troy , New York , appeared in the Daily News Record of October 22 : " More than 13,000 dozen first-quality soft collars left Troy yesterday , consigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most all of the larger collar companies of the city have a share in this emergency order , which was placed by the Department of Commerce at Washington , acting for the American Red Cross there , through the office of the Association of Collar Manufacturers of Troy . " Is it possible that there is nothing that the Japanese need any more than collars ? If so , it seems to me that they are in no great need of American assistance . New York , November ? ' HARRIS S. DURKEE Women and Negroes Excluded To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sir : Your editorial comment on the exclusion of colored men by the Molders ' Union and the exclusion of women by the Barbers ' Union fails to mention that the Molders ' Union also excludes women , not only from the union , but so far as possible from the trade . Unless the rule has been changed recently , union molders are prohibited under penalty of a heavy fine from teaching any part of their trade to women . Men core-makers are eligible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of women now employed in core-making are barred . Mr. Valentine , president of the Molders ' Union and a vice-president of the A. F. of L. , told me , with evidei3t satisfaction , that he had obtained the discharge of a number of women core-makers by informing their employer that the union molders in the shop would not use cores made by women . The Carpenters ' Union also excludes women , thus shutting out thousands of workers in box factories and furniture factories . The policy of the A. F. of L. to which you referred , in refusing separate charters to women excluded from an international union , although it grants separate charters to coloredmen similarly excluded , affects women wood-workers and women core-makers , of course , as well as women barbers . Chicago , November 13 KATHARINE FISHER A Mischievous Movie To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : " The Famous Mrs. Fair , " a moving picture dealing with the problem of the married woman who wants to earn money outside her home , made its appearance in Philadelphia under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubwomen asking them to be present at a private view of the movie and to express their opinions of it . The plot , briefly , is as follows : Mrs. Fair , whose son Alan , aged 19 , is serving with the American Army in France , takes up work in France with the Red Cross , making such a success that she is given the title of major and returns home to find herself a celebrity and in great demand for interviews , lecture appointments , etc . She accepts the offer of a lecture bureau to undertake a coast-to-coast lecture tour for the sum of $30,000 . Her husband , who is opposed to such publicity and to so much outside activity , forbids her to sign the contract , but she does so . During her absence for a few months , husband , son , and the 17-year-old daughter , Sylvia , go to the bad . Her husband is involved in an affair with an adventuress , her son takes to poker and drink and is rescued by a little telephone operator who marries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the manager of the lecture bureau , with whom she elopes . Mrs. Fair 's return to her home for a short visit comes just in time to rescue her family . Those who were active in the club movement and in the suffrage movement recognize the animus pervading this movie . The statement that woman 's place is in the home and domestic happiness totters if she leaves it , even for a short time , is an old enemy that confronted the pioneer feminists at every turn . The efforts of women half a century ago to organize women 's clubs and to obtain for women the right to speak in public and the right to vote were met by the same arguments set forth in this movie ; though not nearly so politely expressed . Susan B. Anthony , Lucretia Mott , Antoinette Brown Blackwell , and other champions of women were received with the greatest insolence ; in fact , with mob violence . Of late years the opposition has assumed another guise ; for two reasons . Suffrage and women 's clubs have arrived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices in public , if we will consent to do it gratis . It is significant that Mrs. Fair , the wife of a millionaire , is to be handsomely remunerated for her lectures . As the economic struggle becomes more intense and more women are driven out of their homes to earn a living , a corresponding reaction against this new competition arises among the men who have heretofore held these jobs . Everywhere we can see attempts to drive women back to the home ; especially married women , on the supposition that their husbands are able and willing to support them . And it is the married women who are seeking employment outside the household in ever-increasing multitudes ! " In manufacturing and mechanical industries the number of married women employed increased 41 per cent during the ten years between 1910 and 1920 , while the number of all women increased only 7 per cent , " said Miss Mary N. Winslow of the Women 's Bureau of the Department of Labor , speaking before the National Conference of Social Workers , May 21 , in Waghington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working for money . " This movie does not deal with the frivolous society woman who is neglecting her home to play bridge , nor does it concern itself with the underpaid scrubwoman , though she may be leaving her children at the risk of their burning to death on the cook stove . No , it is the well-paid lecturer who is the object of the attack . Anxiety on the part of the authors of the movie to , prove their point leads them into many absurdities . Neither husband nor daughter suffers from Mrs. Fair 's visit to France while doing Red Cross work , nor is it intimated that the son Alan might have contracted his tendencies to gambling and drink when with the army . So we must infer that there are two kinds of absence : one owing to patriotism , which is beneficial ; the other owing to the desire of a woman for self-support and self-development , which is pernicious . It is all right for mother to leave husband and daughter to do Red Cross work , but all wrong for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn money by her own efforts . It seems inconsistent that a woman as able as Mrs. Fair should not have arranged for some relative or friend to look after the Fair family , and it is not explained Why a 17-year-old girl should be loafing at home , whether her mother was there or not , and why she was not sent to college . The double standard of morals is encouraged by the casual way in which Mr. Fair acknowledges to his wife his unfaithfulness during her brief lecture tour . " Now , my dear , do n't be unreasonable  --  you went away and left me " is the soothing remark with which he tries to justify himself . Moving pictures , plays , or novels with the reactionary tendencies of " The Famous Mrs. Fair " in a subtle and specious manner make the struggle for equality much more difficult , and handicap the National Woman 's Party and other organizations which are working for freedom and the right to a modern existence for all women . It is a pity that the Civic Club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should bring such a flimsy and reactionary moving , picture to the public notice  --  by way , I suppose , of elevating popular taste . Haverford , Pennsylvania , May 26 MARY WINSOR Lest We Forget Hungary To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : May I suggest that , in your appeal for aid to relieve the situation of German and Austrian institutions of science and art you include tho Hungarian institutions ? I was in Hungary this last summer and I was deeply impressed by the splendid effort Hungary is making to rehabilitate its institutions of higher learning and of creative art . I am sure that your appeal will be even stronger if Hungary is included . I hope that my suggestion may receive your favorable consideration . Princeton , N. J. , November 19 JOHN GRIER HIBBEN Science in Jerusalem To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : On Mount Scopus overlooking Jerusalem , where two thousand years ago the legions of imperial Rome were encamped and where they besieged and finally captured the proud and rebellious capital of Judea , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a foundation laid in 1918 , while the roar of battle still shook the earth . Not far from this landmark stands a plain square building . This is the Grey Hill House , which has been acquired by the World Zionist Organization and which is now being altered and extended to shelter the laboratories of the Medical School of the Hebrew University . Here will be carried on the research work in biochemistry and microbiology and in the tropical and semitropical epidemic and endemic diseases which take heavy toll of Palestine and the adjacent countries . The work for the establishment of the university is the most hopeful message I am now bringing out of Palestine . Unhampered by political interests , unfettered by sectarian prejudices , it will be fostered and maintained by the Jewish people , but it will belong to the whole world and its laboratories will be open to the talent and genius of every land . It will have the Hebrew language for its chief medium of expression , but no other tongue that has a message will be barred . The Hebrew University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-Semitism  --  not a dreamer 's vision , but a practical plan of practical idealists . Already , a large area of land has been acquired adjoining the Grey Hill House for the buildings and grounds of the university , and an X-ray institution has been established , equipped with the most scientific apparatus for the study and treatment of disease . Thousands of volumes on medical and kindred subjects have been sent to Jerusalem to form the nucleus of the university library . It is a source of pride to reflect that the anti-malarial and anti-trachoma work in Palestine has been initiated by an American group , the Hadassah Medical Organization , while the ultimate success of this life-saving and health-saving work will be the result of the efforts of another American Jewish Physicians Committee , through the laboratories that this organization is now establishing on Mount Scopus . Brooklyn , October 10 JOSEPH KRIMSKY , M.D. Lettuce with Sugar and Cream To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : The Drifter 's regret at the disappearance from America of that dish of his boyhood , lettuce with sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alps . Myself an American , I confess never to have met this confection , but I shall tell you where you can find it : you can find it in the land in which , I believe , it originated ? Denmark . True , it is going the sad way of the old Danish peasant costumes , but it is to be discovered now and then ( see if Dr. Egan does n't say so ) where they are : in outlying villages  --  and occasionally , I suspect , at secret night in Copenhagen houses owned by those who , throughout the day , pretend to be advanced beyond the menus of their excellent grandsires .
