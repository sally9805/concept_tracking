Smart Portrait <P> Sirs : <P> No oil portrait of President Harding is hanging in the White House because the joint congressional committee on the library , acting on recommendation of Charles Moore , chairman of the commission of fine arts , declined to accept either one of two portraits painted for that purpose by E. Hodgson Smart , a distinguished English artist . One of these portraits , described by Gertrude Richardson Brigham in Art and Archeology as " one of the few great portraits of a president , " and considered by George B. Christian , the late President 's friend and secretary , as the best painted likeness of Mr. Harding has been purchased by the present owners of the Marion Star and is now hanging in the office of that newspaper at Marion , Ohio . . . . The other Smart portrait of Mr. Harding is in the custody of the National Museum . <P> CARL D. RUTH The Toledo Blade , Washington Bureau . <P> <P> Michigan 's Twice Three <P> Sirs : Humbly petition membership in TIME 's " Erratum-Noters Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presents ( in part ) college ingredients as Michigan 2 , Harvard 2 .

SCOTT , ' 16 St. Paul , Minn . <P> Let Erratum-Noter Scott glance again at the Michigan Alumnus , find therein the words : " James Good came to Ann Arbor after securing a Bachelor of Arts degree from Coe College at Cedar Rapids , Iowa , his home . " TIME referred to Secretary of War Good as Coe-educated . Also the Michigan Alumnus pridefully noted : " Once before as many as three Michigan alumni sat around a cabinet table . That was when Harry M. Daugherty ' 81/ , Edwin L. Denby ' 96/ , and Hubert Work , ' 82-83 , were all appointed by Warren G. Harding . Dr. Work alone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " - ED . <P> <P> Born Kings <P> Sirs : " The first man-child ever born a king , " as TIME puts it , probably was not Alphonso XIII , but one of the old Persian or Parthian kings , whose name I am unable to remember , although you , doubtless , can find it . The monarch referred to may have been Chosroes , but , whoever he was , he was born some time after the death of his father , whose demise made imperative the selection of a new king . Since the queen was with child , and since the astrologers said that it was a boy , the crown was carried in and placed upon the queen above the supposed location of the unborn infant 's head . In this respect the birth of Alphonso must have been a much less regal event . <P> FRANK G. PRESNELL Chillicothe , Ohio <P> <P> Obedient Servant <P> Sirs : By applying such a word as " cowardly " to the expression of an opinion by Mr. Shaw you merely make yourselves and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gutter snapping at a passing mastiff . I have long since ceased to buy your so-called " magazine , " but from the copies I see now and then in libraries and elsewhere I gather that a cheaply-sensational attitude is its present pose .
