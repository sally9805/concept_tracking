While the U. S. Davis Cup team was having a good time taking all five matches from Germany last week on the Rufous Scoria courts of Berlin 's Rotweiss ( Red White ) Club , sport-scribes were having a good time cabling details that did not appear in the scores . Some of the details : <P> U. S. Ambassador to Germany Jacob Gould Schurman perspiring diplomatically in a hot coat while the rest of the gallery sat comfortably in shirtsleeves . . . . Dr. Daniel Prenn stopping in the middle of his match with Francis T. Hunter to chase away an annoying yellow butterfly . . . . Hunter gleefully flinging his racket across the courts after he took the final game from Dr. Prenn . . . . Hans Moldenhauer politely catching William Tatem Tilden 's serve in his hand after an erring referee had called " out " to the previous Tilden service . . . . Patriotic Germans groaning loudly while Doubles-Partners Wilmer Allison and John Van Ryn raced through three sets after dropping the first to the Moldenhauer-Prenn combination . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all about . <P> After the Berlin matches , attention centered on the challenge round , the Strong U. S. v. Strong France in Paris .
