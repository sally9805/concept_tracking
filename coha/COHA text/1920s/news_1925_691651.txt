txt Taxes and Production . The proposed reduction in Federal taxes is a very good thing , but would it not be a very much better thing if all taxes on earned incomes were abolished ? It is an outrage that a doctor , lawyer or a business man , or any one else who works hard for his money , should have any part of it taken from him in taxes while unearned incomes escape . There is no difficulty ? ? in drawing a clear and distinct line between earned incomes and unearned incomes . The only industry in the United ? States which is not taxed to the limit of endurance is the industry of erecting tollgates across the path of progress ; of building barriers to prevent capital and labor from obtaining profitable employment on the land . To tax the land and abolish taxes on productive industries is entirely feasible here and now , and that would place our prosperity on a sane and enduring basis . WILL ATKINSON . Capon Springs , W.
