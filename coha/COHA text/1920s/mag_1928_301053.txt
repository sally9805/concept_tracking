The Lords- <P> Passed through second reading of the so-called " Ditch-the-Daredevils Bill " devised by austere Viscount Cecil of Clel-wood , famed 1924 winner of the $25,000 Woodrow Wilson Peace Award ( TIME , Dec. 15 , 1924 ) . <P> In broaching his bill Lord Cecil said : " I speak for the young , the aged and the infirm . ... I beg this House to realize that the number of motoring accidents in the United Kingdom per 1,000 automobiles exceeds even the terrible ratio recorded in the United States . . . . " <P> As passed the " Ditch-the-Daredevils Bill " would empower municipalities " to construct shallow ditches transversally across important thoroughfares , so as to cause very serious inconvenience to any motorist proceeding at too great a rate . " <P> Perfunctorily passed the Earl of Clarendon 's resolution " that it is desirable that early steps be taken to reduce the number of members of this House . " <P> The resolution was no more than a reminder to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin that he has promised to " reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define its now somewhat nebulous powers and to render it more exclusive by restricting the creation of new Peers . <P> It is thought that the latter step may be taken by having the King create only " Life Peers " whose titles and seats in the House of Lords would expire at death . <P> Although no British " reform " has been more often mooted than this , in recent years , the chance that action will be taken within the next twelve-month is nearly nil . <P> Sat restive under a tongue-lashing from the Earl of Clarendon ( see above ) who scathingly declared : " The members of this House may be divided into three classes . There are hundreds of permanent absentees , there are scores of peers who put in only a very occasional appearance , and there are a few dozen habitual attenders . The work of the House is neatly done by fifty or sixty persons . That is an indication of what little responsibility a large body of noble lords regard their duties in the House . Personally there are 200 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest pang . Many of them could be gotten rid of without their ever finding it out . " <P> Repeatedly cried , " Hear ! Hear ! " when Viscount Sumner took the Earl of Clarendon severely to task for referring to Noble Lords who are habitually absent from the House as " backwoodsmen . " <P> " I will be bold enough to say , " thundered Lord Sumner , " that outside of the United States of America you will not find in the whole wide world one thousand persons better fitted to sustain and dis charge the public duties of a great country than in the peerage of the United Kingdom . " <P> The Commons- <P> Raised and furiously debated a surprising number of extraneous issues when it was announced , last week , that Motor Man Henry Ford had invited Englishmen to associate their capital with his by offering to sell them 40% of the stock of the reorganized Ford Motor Co . Ltd. of England .                  @ @ @
