THE first bill to be presented to the new Congress will provide that the United States shall not furnish arms to the aggressor in war . Opponents of the measure will be eloquent to show that it is dangerous for a neutral to say who is the aggressor in war , which of course it is . But whether the bill be regarded as troublesome or not , to us it typifies the faint hearts of statesmen and the difficulty of approaching international harmony except by the most roundabout path . If there were a sincere feeling that shooting people is wrong , the bill would read simply that the United States shall not furnish arms to anybody . All you 'd have to do to start a war would be to suggest such a thing . ON Thanksgiving Day we had further proof that the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad is , like other railroads , unimaginative . Cruising through the lower level of Grand Central at five o'clock we surveyed the bulletin boards , picked 5:36 as the only Stamford local in evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting for the gate to open . Haply we overheard a veteran commuter remark that " it was too bad the 5:10 was n't running . " We turned this over in our mind , finally bestirred ourself , and by closely questioning a high official in the information booth , discovered ( at 5:09 ) that a 5:10 was indeed running  --  from the upper level . With a mad gesture toward the group of incurious commuters  --  a gesture which was misunderstood  --  we dashed upstairs and just made the train , leaving the others behind . We do not regard it as important that fifteen commuters lost twenty-six minutes each ; but we do regard it as discouraging that the New Haven lacked the ingenuity to erect a little sign : " Upstairs for the 5:10 , ye sheep . " THE idea has always flourished that the interesting people are the people who " do things " but we have long been aware that many people who do things are either too busy to be amiable or so one-sided that they soon become boring . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of a young man who " did nothing . " As he was described to us , he had never worked ; he had never painted , never written , never studied music , and had never pretended to do any of these things . At the earliest possible moment we intend to drop what we are doing and go out of our way to make his acquaintance . We shall try to report later whether or not he is interesting . WE noticed recently that Arnold Constable was advertising forelevator operators ? " preferably young women of college training . " This looks like a big step forward in the refinement of department stores , which are already quite refined . However , the ultimate state to which we look forward is when our shops employ only Princeton men and Vassar girls , and , of the latter , only members of the Daisy Chain . THE ingenuity displayed by the 1 Consolidated Gas Company in camouflaging its steel tank at Fortyfifth Street and the North River has put an idea into our head . Ringed with varicolored stripes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud and mist  --  the first layer of color is a mud maroon , because it is close to the ground ; then comes a reddish tone , to blend with bricks of nearby tenements ; then a purple belt for transition ; then mauve to go with factory smoke ; just a touch of lavender t , ) salute the dawn ; blue to challenge the turquoise cup of sky ; a dash of brindle for the dog star ; and lastly , at the very top , pearl grays and pinkish glow . The result is that you hardly see it . Our idea is to apply this same protective coloration to about two dozen statues which we have noticed in the public places of this town . The Miracle Man THERE has been , to be sure , much talk in town about Max Reinhardt of recent weeks and we have gathered many facts about him , some of which may not be known to all . He is staying at the Savoy-Plaza , having chosen that hotel for the view of the park , but he spends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight hours a day , usually : He has accepted but few invitations for dinner and the only show he plans to see in New York is " The Spider , " which he will produce in Germany . He has , of course , idiosyncrasies . He always , for instance , travels with his own bed linen . One of the twelve trunks he brought with him contained only sheets and pillow cases . Many of the other eleven trunks held only one kind of apparel : there was one for shoes , one for suits , and so on . Those who have visited him in his rooms have remarked a novel whimsy , a series of cards which he pins every morning to his bedroom door . Each is marked either with an hour or a half hour from 6 A.m. to 8 A.m . As he enters the room to retire at night he takes down all save the one marking the hour at which he wishes to be called . He invented this system in Paris , where he once slept uncalled until evening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept far beyond hishour . He has learned to awake at any given time ( but he never sleeps later than eight o'clock ) and explains that he continues the card system merely to preserve some semblance of order . One of Herr Reinhardt 's greatest distinctions is that the Kaiser , to express his displeasure , once walked out on one of his shows . That was several years after he had become head of the Deutsches Theatre , following his sensational production of " A Midsummer Night 's Dream " in 1905 . His playhouse early began to detract from the prestige of the imperial theatres . This annoyed the Kaiser , who was also vexed by the producer 's failure to take certain of his suggestions seriously and by Reinhardt 's friendship with Maximilian Harden and Gerhart Hauptmann . When the Kaiser arose and coldly left his box during a Reinhardt play given by imperial command at Potsdam , he let it be known that he considered it an affront that the producer did not appear in it personally . A snooper in the Kaiser 's entourage dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reinhardt was a name adopted when the producer went to Berlin from Vienna at the age of twenty . The showman was given a certain time to show cause why he should n't he deported . Within twenty-four hours of the time limit imposed , the situation was saved by the Hungarian Minister for Public Education , who dug up an old law which said it was all right for a Hungarian to change his name . In return for this intervention the minister asked only that Reinhardt favor Budapest with a production each year , and this he has done . Now the Kaiser is domiciled in Holland and Herr Reinhardt prospers in Berlin with four theatres and lives in one of the most famous castles in all Europe , Schloss Leopoldskron at Salzburg . Here he has carefully preserved the ancient atmosphere even to the use of nothing but candles for light . He now lives at the castle most of the time but he spends a few weeks each year on the Lido , where he has engaged a bathhouse for the rest of his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to New York because he can get a good cigar here . ? AHORSEMAN has arrived from Philadelphia with tidings of a sign he saw last week in the window of a prominently situated shop m that town : " Food Will Win the War . Do n't Waste It . " Model A THE new Ford has been assembled for us in the technical phrases of an authority on motors . Its principal point of individuality is its high clearance , the height of the body above the ground . A right-about-face from the general trend in motor styles , this is advisable because more than half of America 's owners of Fords have to use them on country roads which are no better than Central Park West . In general lines the new model shows the influence of the Lincoln and La Salle . The radiator and hood are high . The four-winged radiator cap of familiar memory is replaced by a neat flat cap . The fenders sweep outward like a surf-wave , but defiance of the streamline body school is shown by molding which extends along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break in the body line between front and rear . Lamps are nickel-plated and shaped like a half grapefruit . The car is three and a half inches longer than the old Ford . Our observer has seen the new machine run smoothly up to sixty-five miles an hour . He notes that this does not imply that the purchaser can get an equal result but it does indicate a more efficient engine and a better-balanced machine . High clearance has meant more weight to keep the car to the road and more than two hundred pounds has been added , affecting most of the parts . The Ford has fourwheel brakes and , as expected , the gearshift is standard . Springs are of the old crosswise design but heavier and " decently sheathed . " IN Detroit production is being center-ed on the two-door sedan , although a number of coupe-roadsters have been turned out , with the exceptional con-cession of a rumble seat in the back . Touring cars , roadsters and four-door sedans will also be offered . Two-tone green and two-tone tan are the color combinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems , be a set design , and commitments for body fittings , accessories and the like are now on a small scale . The re-tooled plants can be adapted rapidly to style changes in the event that new demands in this regard may have to be met . Deliveries will be slow , as the production schedule is still comparatively light . Our authority warns prospective buyers not to expect too much from the new Ford as it is aimed primarily at the lowest-price market and is not a miniature of a high-priced car . They Do n't Answer ONE of the trials of the telephone V company , it seems , is a scheme whereby certain unscrupulous Westchester residents make long-distance calls free of charge . A commuter , living some distance from the station and wishing some one of the family to meet him in the car , can not always advise his wife in the morning which train he will be able to get . To meet the situation , the wily one arranges to telephone his home ten minutes before the departure of the train he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a signal , however . The wife does n't take down the receiver and the gentleman gets his toll money back for an unanswered call . Another source of annoyance to the telephone company is a dodge worked by petty thieves which has been moderately successful for years . The grafters cram paper , or sometimes cloth , into the hole through which the coins drop when they are returned because calls are not completed . Later the cheaters return , extract the wadding , and pocket such change as has accumulated . It is calculated that the wear and tear on patrons ' nerves represents an economic loss many times as great as the actual amount of money involved . Free SEEKING new sensation , we attended " T h e Ladder " the first night it was presented free to the public . That was Thanksgiving night . With marvellous foresight we had secured a seat early in the afternoon ? which proved fortunate , for at three-thirty the Lyric , a good-sized house , was a sell-out , or rather a give-out . The woman just ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was trying to convince her that there was no charge for the show . She kept proffering money , and finally compromised with fate and reluctantly accepted the free ticket on condition that if she changed her mind , she could return it before the performance . When we came back at eight o'clock , the lobby was full . The doors were plastered with hastily painted signs : " No more seats for tonight . " This news was being repeated in a loud , tolerant voice by the box-office man , who stood in front of his booth , clinging to the brass rail , while eager groups pressed forward and demanded tickets for the morrow . Half amused , half annoyed , he stood there , explaining that " tickets are distributed only on the day of performance . " Lounging about the lobby were persons with a lean and hungry look , bewildered , incredulous , bashful . Somehow the news had got round that here was something for nothing . Occasionally someone would approach the box-office fellow and return a ticket , which would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , applicants were thatikftil for small favors . We saw one group of four hopeful playgoers , hanging round with a starved expression . As they waited , another party turned back three seats . The clerk handed them over to the party of four , who immediately cast lots to determine who should be left out in the cold , solemnly shook hands goodbye with the loser , and went in . The arrivals were a motley crew , for the most part , gum-chewing and dazed . Young shopgirls , escorted by beaux , swaggered in , painfully trying to hide their humiliation at being taken to a hand-out . Thrifty souls who had procured an extra seat wandered about in an embarrassed fashion , trying to invite someone in . One man was bashfully trying to get two girls to Join him , holding out the tickets tantalizingly . Some of those who held tickets were doubtful that they would . really work , doubtful right up to the moment of going through the door . At eight-thirty the box-office man ( who had occasionally shelled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pockets inside out to show that he had nothing concealed on his person , and the crowd thinned . " See , I even got a bribe , " he said , chuckling over a cigar that had been handed him . After months of playing to audiences sometimes as small as a dozen people , the actors seemed to have a moment of stage fright when the curtain rose on the capacity house . Up in the family circle where we crouched , the audience was noisy and rude  --  quite like the gallery in a college town movie house . They grew restless in the more symbolical moments of " The Ladder , " and greeted the darkness at the end of the first act with whistles , cheers , snickers , and boos . One of the intermissions was punctuated with the far-off sound of breaking glass . The show over , the audience , still dazed , wandered away ? the girls to Flatbush , the men to the Mills hotel , ourself to a bench in Bryant Park Grade Crossing 1T OT to be outdone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Long Island 's grade crossings the other day , with the net result that he avoided the train but not the gate . The gate , in fact , descended right across his car so neatly that the small iron rod hanging from the arm imbedded itself firmly in the rear seat . The motorist was just about to wax very , very angry at the railroad gateman , when a policeman appeared and changed his whole attitude . The cop arrested him without ado , for having a railroad gate in his car . Resourceful A DIFFICULT problem was met by a young lady who is a volunteer charity worker when , early this season , she called on an aged and needy couple . She saw at once that their pride would be hurt by the offer of alms of any sort . The samaritan was nonplussed until she saw the couple 's dog , an unhappy little wretch of vague descent . " Why , where did you get that dog ? " she cried . " I wonder if you realize its value . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that her mother had been searching far and wide for a New Mexican setter and had become a bit cynical about life as the search proved vain . " I would love to surprise her with this dog for her birthday , " she went on . " Would you consider parting with it for a hundred dollars ? " The bargain was made . A few weeks later the charity lady returned , and by judicious inquiry found that the old couple 's hundred dollars was disappearing . She thought hard . Then her eyes brightened . " Oh , I wanted to tell you , " she said . " They wo n't allow dogs where my mother lives . She wonders if you would mind taking her setter back and boarding him for the winter until the family moves to the country . Mother says she would pay fifteen dollars a week and there 's no one she would rather trust him to . " It looks as if the aged couple and their dog would get through the winter , and the young lady has until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers of the Charity Organization Society related the foregoing anecdote , and she informs us that there has been a noticeable increase of late in the number of needy persons reported to the charity organizations . The C.O.S. , whose experience is probably more or less typical , plans this year to aid twenty-seven hundred families , twenty per cent more than in the past . A slight increase in unemployment is partially responsible , but the main reason , it is interesting to note , is that more doctors , city officials , factory executives and everyday citizens have acquired the humane habit of reporting worthy eases to societies which make it their business to lend help . Roughing It A N eminent essayist and novelist 1 % was addressing a group of eager ladies at an afternoon gathering in his honor and strove , a listener tells us , to show that be was a man among men rather than merely an artist among artists . " I seek my companions , " he said , " not in literary circles or studios , but among the salty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who these people might be . The writer took a sip of tea . " Largely , " said he , with an outdoors gesture , " largely ship's-folk and taverners . " Children of the Comet SOMEONE used the word " comet " in the course of conversation at a club the other day , whereupon two old gentlemen immediately rose from their deep leather chairs , linked arms , and joined the speakers . They were members of the Delectable Society of Dotards , an organization  --  we think everyone should know  --  devoted to the worship of Encke 's Comet . The society has eight members , all of them born in 1848 under the comet 's guiding light . In fact , nativity in 1848 is the only prerequisite for membership in the Dotards . Those who comprise the society are serious enough about this strange bond of fellowship to have filed their constitution in the New York Public Library . This year the Dotards turn octogenarian , and the comet returns to its orbit  --  two occasions which make it a gala time in Doting circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1915 , a group was chatting in the South Side Sportsman 's Club at Oakdale , L.I . The three stars on a bottle of Hennessy turned the conversation to astronomy . Someone mentioned comets . One man proudly announced that he had arrived on earth as Encke blazed the way . Then it was discovered that all the men in the group had been born that year . In the spirit of the moment there was nothing to be done but start a club . Other Forty-eighters were invited . The news got round and persons of the vintage of 1843 and 1858 ( also Encke years ) tried to crash the membership roll . The charter members held rigidly to an 1848 policy and kept everybody else out . Tradition has it that one of the blackballed applicants wrote a letter , saying : " What does anyone care what a band of dotards does ? " So the Forty-eighters , swallowing the sour grape and liking it , took the name . The comet appears every forty months . The members are affluent , and many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brook . The official seal is a naked baby gazing at the sky through an uplifted brandy bottle . On festive days , we are advised , the Dotards bring out superior wines of their natal year , for ritualistic purposes . They meet in the private homes of the members . Each carries in his pocket an 1848 silver dollar . Two Dotards meeting anywhere , any time , are regarded as a quorum . There are no dues , fees , or by-laws , and every member is a governor . The president is William E. Iselin , an importer . The ambassador is Edward Bement , who lives in Paris and represents Dotard interests in European courts . Edward J. Berwind is the miner , in charge of the Society 's coal ? of which they have none . The navigator is Henry Walters , a member of the New York Yacht Club and in charge , according to records , " of all yachts owned by himself . " Albert V. de Goicouria is general , with power to purchase military supplies . George B. de Forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evarts is treasurer ; and Thomas B. Clarke is collector . That is the whole roster . Latterly the Dotards have held their meetings in the daytime , because the president likes to ride in Central Park before breakfast , and this makes him pretty sleepy when night comes . Dark Lady of the Novels THE colored maid who cleans the apartment of a young hanker who lives in Fourth Street left a note on the mantel the other day , which said : " I have taken one of your books  --  will return it a week from Wednesday " Curious to discover which , of all his hooks , should have found favor in her dark eyes , the employer impatiently awaited the day of restoration , meanwhile in speculation placing her choice somewhere between " Sweepings , " by Lester Cohen , and " Dusty Answer , " by Rosamond Lehmann . Wednesday came and he returned to the apartment . There , neatly laid out on the table , he found his copy of " Black April . " With it was another note , saying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed .
