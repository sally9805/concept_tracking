Mott , of Los Angeles , California , a personal friend of President-elect Hoover 's was one of the contestants . . . . <P> The name of John G. Mott on board the Utah , on our cruise with the President-elect , was almost a byword . . . . <P> JOHN J. CASSIDY <P> U. S. S. Utah Off Panama Roads , R. P. <P> Neville 's Overcoat Sirs : <P> In commenting on Major General Neville 's appointment as Commandant of the Marine Corps ( TIME , Feb. 18 , p. 12 ) you said : <P> " On his way into Germany , replacement doughboys stole his greenish Marine overcoat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . He later found it draped comfortably around an Army mule . " ... I was General Neville 's aide at the time and place and saw the overcoat before and after taking . <P> It was in September , 1918 , during the St. Mihiel offensive that the historic error occurred . American troops half an hour before had occupied Thiaucourt ; the cellars not yet mopped up for German stragglers . General Neville had hastily established headquarters in a basement where he was busy issuing orders for the disposition of troops . His orderly hung the General 's field overcoat in front of the house to dry . Along came mule and caisson with two doughboys perched aloft . German booty was in their minds and in their itching fingers , and the forest-green overcoat looked to them like field-gray . They proceeded to hack the embroidered sleeves off the overcoat with trench knives ; scalps for their sweethearts at home . A good story would be made out of an encounter with at least a Prussian Oberst ! The job was just completed when they were struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a herculean figure dressed in the same enemy color , voice and frown suggesting Ludendorff . The thieves fled in opposite directions leaving the mule to stop the Germans . <P> But the anger was only simulated ; no one enjoyed the joke better than General Neville . That night he twitted doughboy General Ely on the front-line valor of his troops . <P> We all applaud the " horrors of war " story ; it is , the fashion nowadays . But those who soldiered under General Neville have a secret conviction that it was worth the " horrors " to watch him in action . Every inch a man , - and quite a few inches . <P> WILLIAM A.
