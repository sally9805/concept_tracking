The British Empire has maintained its intervention policy in Egypt for 45 years-to protect the Suez Canal , chief artery of British trade . <P> Last week Egyptian public opinion continued hostile to the new treaty proposed by Great Britain which would confirm while slightly relaxing her intervention ( TIME , March 12 ) . As a result no Cabinet could be formed to succeed that of Sarwat Pasha who tendered his resignation last fortnight . <P> The situation was one calling for a British statement to clear the air . This British Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain provided , by issuing a White Book covering the treaty negotiations . In his introduction Sir Austen penned an amazing paragraph : " I could recall the sincerity with which the Ministers of Queen Victoria declared that our occupation of Egypt was only temporary and would be withdrawn at the earliest possible moment . But circumstances proved too strong for us . The moment of withdrawal never came and the events of the intervening 45 years have shown that neither of us could escape from a situation in which God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation imposed upon us . " <P> Observers were vexed to find the Deity so hypocritically invoked by a statesman who recently received the Nobel Peace Prize ( TIME , Dec. 20 , 1926 ) . They agreed that he had flung a flat defy at Egypt . <P> Mme. Zaghlul , widow of the great anti-British statesman Zaghlul Pasha ( 1860-1927 ) , was active at Cairo last week in checking ill-timed anti-British riots by Members of his party , the Wafd . She and servants played a fire hose on certain rioters . Others , unchecked , lost their heads so completely that they mistook for an Englishman and attacked the Principal of the American College outside of Cairo , Dr. Charles P. Russel of Hastings , Neb . At him was thrown acid which burned him , though not dangerously .
