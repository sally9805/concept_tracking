Representative Thaddeus Campbell Sweet of New York telephoned Bolling Field one afternoon last week and asked Lieutenant Bushrod Hoppin , U. S. A. , to fly him to Oswego , N. Y. , where he was to make a speech . Such calls from Congressmen are encouraged by the War and Navy Departments . Lieut . Hoppin did not get the Representative 's name very clearly but proceeded at once with preparations . They took off after breakfast next morning , in a new Army observation plane . By late-luncheon time , the plane was a wreck and Representative Sweet was dead . <P> Lieut . Hoppin , known as a careful pilot , * met a nasty-looking rain squall between Binghamton and Cortland , N. Y. He thought it best to land and selected a field on a stock farm . The field was knobbly . The ship bounced and turned a somersault . Mr. Sweet , having unbuckled his safety-belt , was pitched against the cockpit wall . A head blow killed him . Lieut . Hoppin , belted in his seat , was unbruised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances ever fly with Col. Lindbergh marked the unfortunate end of an able legislator and said : " You see what might happen ? " Friends of flying replied : " Once in a thousand times . " <P> <P> * Lately he was chosen to fly the Chilean Ambassador to Texas and back .
