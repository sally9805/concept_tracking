Of pique in politics the historic example is Senator Hiram Johnson 's rage at Charles Evans Hughes in 1916 for not handshaking him in San Francisco . The 1916 election was so close that Mr. Hughes has always been said to have lost it by that one handshake . Last week , Democrats were hoping that another mountain of pique would be built up from a molehill incident of Nominee Hoover 's visit three weeks ago in Tennessee . <P> The Nominee went to Elizabethton largely under the auspices of onetime ( 1921-23 ) Assistant Secretary of Commerce Claudius Hart Huston and U. S. Representative Brazilla Carroll Reece . The leader of a neighboring and equally Republican district in Tennessee is Representative J. Will Taylor . The Messrs . Huston and Reece have sharp intraparty differences with Mr. Taylor . But it was planned , for harmony 's sake , to let Mr. Taylor be as big a lion as anyone in receiving Nominee Hoover . It was planned that , at the luncheon of the day , Mr. Reece should rise to welcome the Nominee , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both wrote out fine speeches . The hour and the Nominee arrived . <P> During the Reece speech , however , the Nominee grew restive and eyed the hour . So effusively had he been greeted that it was growing late . A crowd was collecting at the outdoor speakers ' stand . Radio time would soon be flying . As soon as Mr. Reece finished and before Mr. Taylor could begin , the Nominee stood up , thanked everyone and left the dining room . Almost everyone else left , too . Mr. Taylor remained in glowering loneliness with his fine speech undelivered in his hand . <P> Mr. Taylor went to the big outdoor meeting . But there was no chance for him to make his fine speech there . Glowering more and more darkly , Mr. Taylor did not go to that evening 's banquet for the Nominee in Johnson City . Instead , he went to Washington . He was mad . They would see . That Carroll Reece ! That Claudius Huston ! That *** never mind ! Just wait . J. Will Taylor controls more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <P> The mollification or non-mollification of J. Will Taylor thus became an important matter . The national Republican committee was reported to be " working on him , " the hope being to keep him quiet .
