The general situation in Eastern China remained , as it has for the past few weeks ( TIME , June 15 et seq. ) , pregnant with ugly possibilities . The Chinese did a great deal of agitating . Foreigners took many steps to secure safety of life . Both sides engaged in desultory conversations which had no outcome . Strikes were maintained in practically all the seaboard cities . At Wukingfu , Kwangtung Province , one male and two female missionaries were beaten and knifed . <P> Diplomatically , however , a number of important moves were made . A short time ago Washington proposed , somewhat nebulously , that an international conference might soon be called to reconsider the attitude of foreign Powers toward Chinese domestic affairs . It is now common knowledge in diplomatic circles , although it is not admitted , that Washington obtained the previous agreement to this proposal from London . At all events , the effect was that last week France ratified two Nine-Power Treaties signed in 1922 at Washington , thereby clearing the stage for concerted action by the nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , Japan , the Netherlands , Portugal , Belgium and China ) . <P> One Nine-Power Treaty related to Chinese customs . The other and more important contained Mr. Elihu Root 's resolutions that the Powers agree to respect the sovereignty , independence and territorial and administrative integrity of China , and at the same time agree to maintain the principle of equal opportunity for all nations in commerce and industry . Under these general terms lay specific proposals to call an international conference ( which was virtually called last week by President Coolidge ) to consider the abrogation of extraterritoriality ( trials by consular courts ) , the setting up of mixed courts , withdrawal of foreign troops and retrocession of leaseholds . <P> French ratification of these treaties cleared the way for the Powers concerned to give effect to their good resolutions concerning China . Unfortunately , the Powers , Britain in particular , have been unable to see the Chinese woods for the trees . British Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain in numerous speeches made it evident that the cause of the present Chinese unrest is due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Georg Tchitcherin indignantly denied . Unbiased reports from China-that is , the average of biased reports , for all communications from that once celestial land are more or less colored-seem unanimous that the root of the disturbances is due to the foreign Powers which exploit China economically and dominate her politically . Bolshevik influences , which are obviously existent , found rather than caused a situation of deep discontent , which was naturally receptive of Moscow 's virulent propaganda .
