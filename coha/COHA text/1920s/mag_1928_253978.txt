Someone in Indiana started a chain letter last week . It read : " Ex-Governor Warren T. McCray is honest , also he is broke . I am mailing a $1 bill to him at Indianapolis and writing letters like this to five persons ( including yourself ) , suggesting that they do likewise and each write five more letters . " <P> Soon Warren T. McCray , who ceased being Indiana 's Governor when he was convicted of a mail fraud in 1924 , was in receipt of $60 . Said he : " I am deeply grateful to my unknown friend , who in such a great-hearted manner has suggested this idea of being helpful to me . " <P> Should the chain letters reach a tenth link everywhere , the original five letters , raised to the tenth power , would net Mr. McCray $9,765,625 . Lest someone should suspect this mail scheme was his own , Mr. McCray announced further : <P> " Although deeply grateful . . . I am not seeking charity , but only ask a chance to make good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * carrying with me nothing but kindly thoughts . " <P> *He had been in Indianapolis to testify at the trial of Governor Jackson ( TIME , Feb. 27 ) that Governor Jackson offered him a $10,000 bribe in 1923 , and that he refused it .
