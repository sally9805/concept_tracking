Last week , the town of Gary , Ind. , celebrated " Witwer Day . " The newspapers had editorials and there was a concert . In the concert a girl sang to the sound of an orchestra . The girl 's name was Kathryn Witwer , she was the daughter of a Gary , Ind. , mechanic , she had won a young girl 's singing contest , she had sung from the stage of the Chicago Opera Company , her voice had been mildly praised by competent critics , she wanted to go abroad and study music but she had no money . This last fact accounted for the existence of Witwer Day . The good folk of Gary were eager to club together and pay her schooling expenses . After the concert and the other festivities , Miss Witwer got $3,000 . <P> Reading the far-flung accounts of this insignificant event , operagoers were at a loss to discover the reason for Miss Witwer 's sudden prominence .

If she made her debut at the Metropolitan ( Otto Kahn , Chairman ) , opera-devotees would again make puns about " You Kahn or you Kah n't , " or " What 's the matter with Witwer ? She 's O.K.
