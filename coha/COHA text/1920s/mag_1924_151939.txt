Scratch a Californian and you find a tennis player . Last week more tennis laurels went West . The ubiquitous , indefatigable , highly skillful brothers Kinsey-Robert and Howard - convinced all comers at the Longwood Cricket Club ( Chestnut Hill , Mass. ) that the national doubles wreath ought to hang on the Golden Gate beside Helen Wills ' national singles , doubles and Olympic foliage and the numerous , though more withered , prizes of Mary K. Browne , May Sutton Bundy , Maurice E. Mc-Laughlin , " Little Bill " Johnston and " Peck " Griffin . <P> Had it not been for the Kinseys , the doubles title would have gone as far West as Australia . Gerald L. Patterson and Pat O'Hara Wood were thought to be in their most invincible Antipodean form when the finals came . But the brothers Kinsey pulled themselves together after three battering sets , brought out their lobs and fighting spirit , saved the day by this score : 7-5 5-7 , 7-9 , 6-3 , 6-4 . <P> Nothing startling came from the French Davis Cup players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the semifinal .

By the end of the week young Helen Wills and young Vincent Richards were left to face the 1923 champions , Molla Mallory and " BigHearted Bill " Tilden .

Pate and Sam Hardy , of New York . <P> Father and Son Doubles Champions : A. H. Chapin Sr. , and A. H. Chapin Jr. , of Springfield , Mass . <P> Longwood Cricket Club was also holding a women 's invitation tournament and the galleries got their first glimpse of 16-year-old Helen Jacobs of California , heralded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several good second-raters , but lost flat-footed to Miss Eleanor Goss .
