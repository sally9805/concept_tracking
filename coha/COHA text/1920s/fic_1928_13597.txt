ACT I The house is two hundred years old . Walls are panelled , the fireplace is large . For the most part the furniture is old American , but there has been no attempt at " period " so the house has not the atmosphere of a museum . The sea is less than a quarter of a mile away . Autumn has been brought indoors . Scene : The living-room . A small table , a larger table , a walnut horse-hair sofa , two or three Windsor arm-chairs , a plain , full-length couch at the left near the wall . Above the fireplace at right are bookshelves . There is but one picture on the walls , a drawing of Mugs , the comic little man who is making Karl famous . The rear door opens directly outdoors . A door right , rear , a door left , near front , and a smaller door left , rear . Time : It is early evening . The only light is from a double candlestick on the small table and a single candle burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , a slight , chic woman . She is pulling off her gloves . Her travelling-bag stands against the wall . With unfriendly curiosity she is examining the room . From the bookshelves , made of drift-wood , she takes a paper-backed volume of Derain 's paintings , turning a few leaves , bored , puts the volume back . Stands by a chair before the fireplace on which baby clothes are spread . Catching sight of the one picture , she carries the candle to it . A half articulated expression of disdain . Off stage a door closes . A servant 's voice  --  the words " waiting for you in there . " A cool , distinguished voice : " Oh ? And Wallops ? Has he cried ? " Servant 's voice : " Not a sound out of him . I tell you that baby 's not like some . " The mother 's voice , laughingly : " No , not like most . " Stephen 's wife , Eleanor , enters from the door at right with the things she has been gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one arm , a small pail in the other hand , falling over the basket are long branches . She is wearing what apparently were the things nearest at hand when she started out  --  a man 's blue coat over her sweater , a man 's grey cap . She has been near the sea in wind and mist . ELEANOR How do you do ? p. 3 LUELLA ( from beside the fireplace , uncertain ) : You are Mrs. Rolf ? ELEANOR Yes . Why , Mary 's left you almost in darkness . ( Steps towards the lamp . ) LUELLA Do n't light it for me . I like this soft candlelight ( with a short laugh )  --  one does at my age . ELEANOR I hope it was n't dreary , waiting here alone ? LUELLA Oh , no ! But what is that far-off rumbling sound ? ELEANOR The sea is just beyond the rise . LUELLA Coming over I could n't make out where I was . The road seemed to go no place at all . ELEANOR It goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting ! Pause . You and I do n't know each other . ELEANOR No , not yet . LUELLA It 's your husband I know . ELEANOR Oh . You are a friend of Stephen 's ? Wo n't you sit down ? p. 4 LUELLA Thank you . ( Remains standing . ) In fact , I 'm Luella McClure . This does not convey as much as she had expected it would . ELEANOR ( quickly covering her uncertainty , holding out her hand ) : Stephen and I did n't know each other before we were married . They clasp hands , but the constraint has not gone . LUELLA Strange he never spoke of me . ELEANOR ( after another pause ) : But have you had dinner ? LUELLA Yes , thank you  --  in Chatham . ( Hastily . ) I had expected to stay there to-night . Perhaps I had better go back now , and  --  and write to Stephen . ELEANOR Stephen will be here any minute now . LUELLA I did send him a line from New York . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it ? ELEANOR I  --  perhaps not . LUELLA There is something I want to talk over with Steve . When your maid said you would be back directly I told the man who drove me over not to wait . Perhaps  --  ( Hesitates , uncertain. ) p. 5 ELEANOR We can put you up to-night . LUELLA I do n't want to be a nuisance . ELEANOR ( with reserve ) : A friend of Stephen 's would not be a nuisance . He had to drive down to Hyannis for some colours . He is painting me . LUELLA He started to paint me once . ELEANOR He did n't finish it ? LUELLA ( dryly ) : No . ELEANOR He says he never used to finish anything . ( As if the dimness , both in the room and in the conversation , were too much . ) But I must give you more light , and then I 'll have a look at my baby . LUELLA I did n't know you had a baby . ELEANOR Oh , did n't you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this friend of her husband . Gathering up the baby things from the chair . ) I 've about forgotten what life is like without a baby . LUELLA ( not happily ) : It does make a difference . ELEANOR ( pushing a cigarette box toward her ) : A cigarette ? And perhaps you 'll have some coffee ? p. 6 LUELLA Thank you , no . I had two cups in Chatham . Wanted to fortify myself . ELEANOR Not against me ! LUELLA Well . . . I 'm not as sure of myself as I once was . ELEANOR We could have a fire . LUELLA Do n't bother . ELEANOR It wo n't take a moment . ( Lights fire , which blazes quickly . ) It 's driftwood . The flames will have strange colours in them . LUELLA ( vaguely ) : Yes ? ELEANOR ( lights lamp . They see each other 's faces clearly for the first time ) : Why  --  have n't I met you before ? LUELLA I think not . ELEANOR ( after continuing to look perplexed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LUELLA Oh , no . I 'm really awfully sorry to have come in this way . ELEANOR Do n't say that . ( Takes baby clothes from chair , leaves through the door at the left , rear . ) Luella smokes nervously , shrugs , looks around , says in comment on the lonely house and Eleanor . p. 7 LUELLA My God ! In the silence the surf becomes audible , more as a vibration than a sound . Luella occupies herself with her vanity case , fixes her curly , bobbed hair under her hat . In the clearer light Luella looks her age . She is dressed too youthfully . Eleanor 's happy voice off stage : " Sleeping like an angel . " Servant 's voice , in a hoarse whisper : " Tony 's out there . It 's the only night he can git off from the station this week . He says the dance in town is goin ' to be good . It 's the Social Orchestra ! " Eleanor 's voice : " Very well , Mary . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to-morrow , and I 'll be making the jelly . " Mary 's voice : " Oh , sure ! " Calling excitedly " To-ny ! " Eleanor enters . ELEANOR Our Portuguese Mary has a life-saving beau . It 's interesting how many nights are the only night he has off that week ! ( She sits down , pours beach plums from her basket into an old-fashioned wooden bowl . They make a cascade of rich colours  --  cerise , purple , concord blue . LUELLA ( politely ) : What do you do with them ? ELEANOR The ripest are for wine  --  the others for my jelly . p. 8 LUELLA They 're a nice colour . A dress of all those colours would be good . ( Seeing the dress . ) Very good . ELEANOR ( sorting them with quick , deft movements of both her hands ) : They grow best in the hollows , on the slopes away from the sea . About this high , most of them are . ( She indicates three feet . ) You catch sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must taste the jelly they make ! LUELLA I would n't have expected Stephen 's wife to be so domestic . ELEANOR ( with a half look at her ) : Would n't you ? LUELLA ( a little peevishly ) : Men like domestic women . ELEANOR Gathering things for the house is a reason for being out . The September hills make one believe in the beneficent God of our childhood . LUELLA There was no beneficent God in my childhood . ELEANOR ( with a curious , disarming , rather disconcerting simplicity ) : That 's too bad . ( She is still sorting her plums . ) My people were here long ago . They built this house in seventeen hundred and something . I feel my great grandfather in the old forgotten roads , on the beach . p. 9 LUELLA ( in a horrified whisper ) : Do you see him ? ELEANOR ( laughing ) : I do n't mean his ghost . But he lingers in things he made or touched , in my own imagination . . . . He is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries , in New York  --  he has returned . LUELLA ( relieved ) : Oh . Well , I 've wandered myself  --  Europe , Paris  --  ELEANOR Oh , Paris . It is another light on Luella . Are you just over ? LUELLA A week in New York . I thought I 'd find Karl and Nina there . ELEANOR You know Karl and Nina ? LUELLA Well , naturally , I know Nina . ( As Eleanor does not understand . ) Why , do n't you know ? I 'm Nina 's mother . ELEANOR You are Nina 's mother ! But you ca n't be ! LUELLA ( pleased by the implication ) : Oh , yes , I am ! ELEANOR Why , then we are relatives ! Let 's see , you are the mother-in-law of my husband 's brother ! p. 10 LUELLA Do n't call me mother-in-law ! ELEANOR No , you 're not half old enough . LUELLA I married at sixteen . ELEANOR ( with great interest ) : Did you , really ! Do you know , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a child . . . . LUELLA ( grimly ) : It 's not so wonderful . ELEANOR It brings you closer together . LUELLA Sometimes it puts you farther apart . ELEANOR Now I was thirty-five when I married . LUELLA ( laughing ) : Well , you do n't mind telling , do you ? ELEANOR Not very much . LUELLA Steve is n't thirty-five , is he ? ELEANOR No . Steve 's thirty-three . LUELLA Thirty-three  --  now . ELEANOR ( quietly , getting this ) : Yes  --  now . ( Pause . ) It does n't seem to matter  --  my being older than Steve . But I 'm so many years older than Wallops . ( Wistfully , here wanting the other woman to meet her . ) I hope there is n't too big a gulf . Luella does not meet her . Takes another cigarette and shakes it down . Lights matches nervously . Eleanor pushes her the candle . p. 11 LUELLA Funny  --  you not knowing I was Nina 's mother . ELEANOR When I saw you in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your hair is different . LUELLA It 's dyed . ELEANOR Is it ? ( Pause . ) But the name  --  Nina was Nina Ramsey . LUELLA I married again . ( With a laugh . ) Twice . ( Viciously . ) I 'm sick of men ! ( As Eleanor does not reply . ) So Stephen never mentions me . Does n't he ever talk about Paris ? ELEANOR Not often . LUELLA Did he approve of Karl 's marriage ? ELEANOR He thought Karl was pretty young . LUELLA I had made other plans for Nina . Karl had n't a cent , had he ? ELEANOR He had his salary . Karl  --  ( Her hands are still as she thinks of him . ) Next to Stephen I love him more than anybody . LUELLA Artists are selfish . p. 12 ELEANOR ( easily ) : Not always , I think . LUELLA I married two of them . What else does Karl do ? ELEANOR What else ? LUELLA Nothing but funny pictures ? What a silly way to make a living ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic . When you see Karl you will wonder how slight a boy can have so strong a grip on  --  well , on wisdom . The things he can laugh at ! ( Pause . ) You have never met Karl ? LUELLA No , I 've been in Paris for a long time . I knew Stephen in Paris . ELEANOR Yes , of course . LUELLA Nina could have married Joseph Herbert , whose father has millions . With that beauty  --  ELEANOR She is very beautiful . But if she were my daughter and could have married anybody in the world , I 'd be happy to see her married to Karl . LUELLA ( with constraint ) : Perhaps you have n't had to worry about money . ELEANOR ( with an easy laugh ) : I really ought to worry about it now . p. 13 LUELLA What do they plan to do ? ELEANOR You know they are on their way North in their new car ? LUELLA ( nodding ) : Yes . When they were n't in New York I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we hope , before they begin living in town . Stephen fears Karl ca n't stand the New York winters , nor the New York grind . LUELLA ( harshly ) : He 's not an invalid , is he ? ELEANOR No . ( Hesitating . ) No . But he must be careful . LUELLA ( sharply ) : Careful ? ELEANOR Dr. Rolf died fighting a tropic fever . Karl , who at that time meant to become a doctor , was working with his father . He had a bad attack himself . It left him  --  less strong . LUELLA I did n't want another artist in the family . And certainly not a comic artist ! ELEANOR ( gently humorous ) : But it 's Nina 's marriage , is n't it ? LUELLA Who worked and sacrificed to bring Nina up ? Who schemed and  --  Ford cheerfully honks. p. 14 ELEANOR ( with relief ) : That 's Stephen . ( Puts down her things , goes out , right . ) LUELLA ( nervously arranging herself ) : I hardly know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Hello , there ! " Eleanor 's voice : " Back again , dear ! " Stephen 's voice : " How 's my honey ? " Eleanor : " Was it nice ? " Stephen : " I wish you 'd been along . It was great driving home through the mist and the blow . " He is , still unseen , struggling out of his coat . Eleanor 's voice : " Listen , Stephen . . . " Stephen begins to sing lustily , making up words and tune at once : " Oh , blow , blow , blow , how the wind doth blow ! Through the mist and the blow we go . " Eleanor 's voice : " But , Stephen , do listen to me . " Stephen 's voice : " Oh , blow , blow , blow ! They enter , Stephen holding Eleanor in a rough hug , half dragging her . He sings : " Through the mist and the blow . " Blow has come full , prolonged , arm wide in an operatic gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEPHEN I did n't know I had an audience . ( Recognizing her with incredulous surprise and confusion . ) Why , Luella ! Hello ! How do you do ? I thought  --  I thought you were in Paris . ( Shakes her hand , unable to say another word . ) Eleanor watches them . p. 15 LUELLA You are so surprised . I wrote you last week . STEPHEN ( not convincingly ) : How good to have you drop in like this ! LUELLA ( confused also ) : My letter must have been lost . STEPHEN ( plucking a sheaf of letters from his pocket , looks through them ) : We 've been so deep in it here  --  painting , gathering things , making wine , we forget about the post office . LUELLA You have a nice place . STEPHEN How 's Paris ? Changed ? ( Hastily answering himself . ) Oh , yes , I know it is changed . Everything is . LUELLA The Quarter 's full of Americans ! Such people ! You just do n't know where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ELEANOR You must n't say no ; it 's wine he made himself . ( To Stephen . ) We were talking and I forgot the wine . STEPHEN Talking . . . ? ( He has taken the jug from a corner cupboard and is pouring the wine. ) p. 16 LUELLA ( slyly ) : Not about you , Stevie . Eleanor , struck by the pet name , looks soberly at Stephen . STEPHEN Here you are  --  the red juice of wild plums . And it is very old . I made it last Fall . ( When all have glasses . ) To  --  what shall it be ? LUELLA ( also hesitant ) : To  --  ELEANOR To Paris  --  to Springtime in Paris . Luella smiles at Stephen . Chestnut trees dripping with rain , the hiss of a syphon into a glass ! STEPHEN To Paris . All drink . It seems far away and long ago . LUELLA ( bitterly ) : It is not too far away for Luella McClure . ELEANOR Is n't the wine good ? Stephen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Well , I 've been drinking French wine a number of years now . It is delicious though . STEPHEN Is there anything to eat in the house ? p. 17 ELEANOR ( shocked ) : You 've not had your dinner ? Why did n't you stop at the inn ? STEPHEN La saison est fini . Nothing open but hot dog stands , God help us all ! ( Sighing . ) I made a poem driving back : Wending a lonely road I met a ghoul Sitting on a hearse . He raised an axe ! What hast thou , ragged fool , Besides thy purse ? LUELLA ( worried ) : Oh , it 's going to be unpleasant . STEPHEN Yes , unpleasant ; but it has a happy ending : Take , oh take my ears , yea , take my useful eyes ! But stay thine axe ! Hack not my tongue : so highly do I prize My own wise cracks ! LUELLA ( giggling ) : Do you still take yourself seriously , Stephen ? STEPHEN Yes . ELEANOR ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Rising . ) Now I 'll get you something to eat . STEPHEN I do n't want much . p. 18 ELEANOR Mushrooms ? I gathered them myself . STEPHEN ( accusingly ) : You read my thoughts , woman . LUELLA ( after Eleanor has gone out , right ) : Lucky Stephen Rolf ! STEPHEN ( in surprise , as he pours another glass ) : What ? Oh , yes . ( Slowly , as if realizing it himself , but almost reluctantly . ) Yes . I am lucky . ( Firmly . ) I am . LUELLA You 've put on weight , have n't you ? ( Hastily . ) It 's awfully becoming . STEPHEN Thanks . LUELLA You seem older . STEPHEN I am older . LUELLA In Paris you had something  --  moody and strange . Like some quick , dark-eyed animal . Not sure of yourself , but so alive ! STEPHEN ( sadly ) : A calf . LUELLA Now you are more solid . More  --  comfortable . STEPHEN ( depressed ) : Oh my God , Luella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . I made dreams for myself and dreams for all the people . Now the time has come , and I do n't believe in my dreams for the people , and the dreams for myself have , in a way , come true . So there is n't any future . But , you see , I always lived in the future . I do n't know how to live in any other dimension ! p. 19 LUELLA I think the fourth dimension is a wonderful idea . STEPHEN Three are more than I know what to do with . You have n't added a day to your age in  --  let 's see ! How long has it been ? LUELLA Three years and four months . STEPHEN Has it been that long ? Good years for you ? LUELLA Terrible years ! ( Bitterly . ) Thanks to you , Stephen Rolf ! STEPHEN To me ? Why , my dear . . . ! Eleanor enters with dishes . Places things on small table , gives Luella a considering glance . To Stephen : ELEANOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , dear . Eleanor goes . LUELLA I want life to be different . STEPHEN For that , honey , you 'd better pray to God . I ca n't change it . LUELLA You are too irresponsible , Stephen . All artists are like that ! I want another chance ! STEPHEN We all do , Luella . But it 's against the rules . p. 20 LUELLA ( shortly ) : You have n't changed so much . ( Again wistful . ) I want to move back to New York . ( Raising her glass . ) To Paris in the Springtime ! To Hell with Paris ! STEPHEN I 'll not drink to that . LUELLA I want to be comfortable , like you and Eleanor . These old bones ( thrusting out a shapely silken leg ) are tired . They want to be as old as they are . STEPHEN What 's your new scheme ? LUELLA It is n't a scheme . It 's a practical idea . I 'm sick of Bohemia . STEPHEN One is supposed to get sick of Bohemia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? STEPHEN We all are . The years fly away from us . ( As if making a discovery . ) You know , I like this wine ! LUELLA Of course , Jack Ramsey , Nina 's devoted father , did n't leave me behind , because I left him . How that man pinched his pennies ! I never had a decent dress the whole year and a half I was with him . He painted in the diningroom of the cramped little flat we had in Brooklyn . When I went to mother , she said : " But what are you going to do now ? " She always thought of herself first , a selfish woman . But good-looking ! ( With feeling . ) She was as beautiful as Nina ! Both pause as before Nina 's beauty . So there I was in New York  --  eighteen years old . I did have a good time . ( Giggles . ) Then I met McClure . He was mad about me . And I really cared a lot for him . ( Drains her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember McClure . LUELLA ( resentfully ) : Oh , yes , I know  --  you admire his " talent . " STEPHEN He did some good portraits of you . LUELLA ( with a pause between every word ) : He has n't turned over a cent to me for six months . ( As Stephen 's silence seems to rebuke her . ) You know , Stephen , I would n't take a cent if it were just for me . I can make my way  --  but there 's his own child , Alice . She 's seven years old already . And the money you can spend for clothes , and the right teachers and doctors ! STEPHEN Has she been ill ? LUELLA Oh , no . I mean if she were . STEPHEN I see . LUELLA She will be a beautiful woman . ( Laughing . ) Oh , she 'll make the men stand around ! ( Bitter again . ) McClure has been trying to get her away from me . STEPHEN But were n't you doing something for What's-his-name ? Buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to be independent of men , that 's why I 've come to you . Stephen , regarding her , slightly bows . I 'm thinking about starting a little shop . ( Giggles uncertainly . ) Scarfs and frocks  --  little things  --  bracelets . I know the purser on one of the boats , charming , tall , foreign-looking . He is mad about me ! He could get some things through without  --  without paying too much on them . Oh , I have been very practical about it all . And , Stephen , you know people in New York  --  you could help a lot . ( With intensity . ) You owe it to me ! Since you left , nothing has been the same . Eleanor enters with a tray  --  cold chicken , the mushrooms . p. 22 STEPHEN How good ! But it 's an awful lot . ELEANOR You need it , dear . ( To Luella . ) He is for ever talking about dieting . STEPHEN ( ravenously attacking a chicken leg ) : Yes , talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Lord , all men do ! STEPHEN When I was a boy I was a Socialist because I wanted everybody to have enough to eat . He is eating the chicken leg with increasing relish . Quotes , rather sadly : " Arise , ye prisoners of starvation . " ( With a sigh . ) " You have nothing to lose but your chains  --  watches , radios , Fords and your robes of fibre silk ! " LUELLA What 's that ? STEPHEN ( to Eleanor ) : It 's hard to forgive the poor for not being poor . LUELLA Steve was always so radical . STEPHEN We used to sing a sarcastic Socialist song  --  " Jesus knows all about economic determinism . " But the joke was on us . He did . LUELLA Lately I 've become interested in Indian philosophy . Not eating and sticking pins in yourself . p. 23 STEPHEN ( to Luella ) : Karl and Nina are going to live in New York . LUELLA New York 's the only part of America fit to be lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Karl ! But , of course , Nina thinks only of herself . ELEANOR ( low ) : Stephen ! LUELLA ( calmly ) : Oh , I know Nina  --  as well as Steve does . But if you 're that good-looking you can get away with being selfish . STEPHEN ( with fervour ) : She is beautiful ! I 'll never forget the first time I saw her , standing in the doorway of your apartment . ( Recollecting Eleanor , turning to her , confused . ) It was in Paris I first met Nina . Perhaps I never spoke of it . ELEANOR No , you never spoke of it . LUELLA We were cozy by the fire . It was raining and raining outdoors . ( Laughs , drinks more wine . ) Then somebody knocked . ( She knocks hard and quick . ) STEPHEN You thought she was in America . p. 24 LUELLA Stephen said men would destroy themselves for beauty such as hers . STEPHEN ( drily ) : That was in an earlier style of mine . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroying himself . ( Suddenly remembering . ) We have a card from him . ( Takes it from the letters . ) Karl 's notes are mostly pictures . ( Smiling , he hands it to Luella , who looks at it blankly . ) They 've got a big foreign car . LUELLA How nice ! STEPHEN ( angrily ) : Karl ca n't do things on that scale . LUELLA ( more to Eleanor ) : Then he does n't do so well with his funny pictures . ELEANOR I do n't believe we need worry . ( She is looking at Karl 's card , smiling . ) A man who can draw funny pictures that are funny wo n't starve  --  not in America . STEPHEN You 'll like Karl . ELEANOR When you are with Karl , everything is  --  clearer . p. 25 STEPHEN But he 's not fitted to buck New York . LUELLA ( drily ) : No , he does n't sound so to me . ELEANOR I have n't shown you your room . You have n't even taken off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you will want some things . LUELLA Oh , no , I always have a few things along . ( Hastily . ) You never know when a car may break down , or something . Stands by her bag , expecting Stephen to take it for her . He does not even see it , annoyed . Taking a candle , Eleanor starts ahead . After opening the door at the left , front , she turns . ELEANOR ( in a low voice ) : We will have to talk quietly until we get upstairs . Wallops is at the end of the hall . LUELLA ( turning back to Stephen ) : Your home-brew has quite a kick , Stevie . After they have gone , Luella 's voice , not quietly : Do you play bridge ? Stephen moves things about in irritation . Stands and thinks . Pours himself wine . Takes Karl 's card from the table , looks at the pictures , smiles . Eleanor enters . p. 26 ELEANOR Wallops is  --  STEPHEN Eleanor , what do you mean , having that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to smile , the smile grows . I do n't care if I do know her . She 's not a person we want in the house . ELEANOR You seem to have been in her house . STEPHEN That 's another matter . She 's a silly , vulgar woman . ELEANOR ( gathering up dishes ) : She is Karl 's mother-in-law . STEPHEN Yes . ( Thinks . Softly , in dejection . ) Damn it , she is ! ( More lightly . ) She did give me a shock ! ELEANOR Steve , I think it  --  odd , that you never spoke of knowing Nina 's mother . STEPHEN It was  --  all mixed up with other things . ( Irritably . ) I was just congratulating myself on being through with that family when Karl married Nina . ( Shortly . ) I was pretty sick about it . Do n't know what I would have done if I had n't just then met you , Eleanor . You made another world . It was  --  from another place in life . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . ( An arm around her . ) You 'll never know how much I need you . An automobile is heard . They listen , still holding each other 's hands . Somebody going on to the station . p. 27 ELEANOR ( as the car stops ) : No , they 're turning around to go back . The motor-horn plays a tune . STEPHEN ( at the window ) : It 's for here . A big car . I wonder  --  it ca n't be  --  ( Opens the rear door and goes outside . ) Eleanor hastily gathers up dishes . Well , of all  --  Laughter , voices . A boyish voice : " How 's old Stevie ? " Eleanor knows that voice and is glad to hear it . They are coming nearer . A woman 's voice , high , clear , arrogant : " Karl thought we could n't make it till to-morrow , but . . . " Words lost in laughter . The woman 's voice again : " Made a dash for it . " Karl enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walks nervously , swiftly toward Eleanor , hands out . KARL How are you , Eleanor ? ELEANOR Karl ! I 'm so glad . ( Holds his hands , puts her arms around his neck . ) He kisses her . KARL You 're so tanned and husky-looking . ELEANOR We 've heard about your new success . I knew it would come . p. 28 KARL ( laughing excitedly ) : It surprised me ! STEPHEN ( off stage ) : Now come into the light , young lady , and let 's have a look at you . Enter Nina and Stephen . ELEANOR Well , Nina ! NINA Here we are . Nina does not know whether to kiss her sister-in-law or not . Eleanor takes the initiative . They are not certain with one another . ELEANOR We were n't sure you 'd get here . And not so soon . NINA That car 's not bad ! STEPHEN ( taking Nina farther into the light , she laughing , excited , knowing she has come in out of the blowy night , near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all look at her for a moment  --  she pleased , seeming a little shy ) : Does he beat you ? NINA No , Karl is good to me . ELEANOR ( with affection for Karl ) : Of course he is . NINA ( turning to Eleanor ) : And this is your house  --  the house we 've heard so much about . ( A glance around , uncertain what to say. ) p. 29 STEPHEN ( to Karl , taking hold of him , looking hard into his face , slowly ) : Gee , but I 'm glad to see you . ( Briskly . ) How are you ? How 've you been ? NINA Karl 's been fine . Is n't that so , Karl ? KARL Never better . ( Coughs , laughs through it . ) STEPHEN A little cold , are n't you ? Our Cape nights are n't balmy . NINA Oh , we were n't a bit cold . STEPHEN ( lightly ) : But you have a fur coat . ELEANOR A very becoming fur coat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the South . KARL Maybe you do n't want us to visit you ! STEPHEN Maybe we do n't . Maybe you could find an hotel somewhere . All laugh . NINA Karl bought out a whole store in Chatham . It 's in the car . ELEANOR How nice of you ! But you would n't have starved . We even have a cook . p. 30 NINA Way out here ? How do you keep her ? ELEANOR We do n't . Tony the lifeguard keeps her . ( As all laugh . ) Keeps her working here . But I 'd cook for you myself  --  I 'm that glad to have you . ( She is taking Nina 's coat . ) We 'll get acquainted . NINA ( with a smile that makes her beauty dazzling ) : Better acquainted . ELEANOR Oh ! We have a surprise for you . Who do you  --  The baby cries . KARL Why , Eleanor , that 's not a surprise . ELEANOR ( laughing ) : Just a minute . NINA Could I see him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eleanor is warmer with her . ) ELEANOR Would you like to ? NINA ( her voice richer than it has been ) : Oh , I 've been wanting to see that baby ! ELEANOR ( taking the candle ) : We are n't a bit ashamed of him . They go out . p. 31 STEPHEN Well , now we 're rid of the women . They sit down before the fire . Stephen gives Karl a frank , keen look . Karl meets it smilingly . I believe you 've been growing up . KARL ( nods ) : Maybe I have . STEPHEN ( sharply ) : Karl , you 're cold . ( Takes his arm . ) You 're shivering ! ( Getting up . ) I 've got something for that . ( Takes a bottle of whisky and glasses from the corner cupboard . ) The pre-war for you . ( Pours it . ) KARL ( smelling it ) : Out of the past . Is n't it too precious to drink ? STEPHEN I 'd like to know what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KARL To you , Stevie . STEPHEN ( rather gravely ) : Your health , Karl . And happiness . ( After their drink . ) What 's the big idea  --  coming North for the bad weather ? p. 32 KARL Nina has always wanted to live in New York . And then it 's good to be nearer the men who pay out the jack . STEPHEN Think so ? KARL ( laughing nervously ) : Do n't you ? I ca n't loaf now , Steve . ( Gets up and walks swiftly across the room and back . ) Yes , the big idea is money ! ( Nina 's coat is where he wants to sit ; moves it , sits down . ) STEPHEN Of course , the big idea is to take care of yourself . KARL ( impatiently brushing his hair back ) : I 'm beginning to think there 's something to this idea of not thinking much about your health . STEPHEN Whose idea is that ? KARL ( lightly ) : Just an idea in the air . STEPHEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were n't almost a doctor without knowing that . KARL Almost a doctor is good . Almost an artist  --  STEPHEN ( pointing to the picture of Mugs ) : The fellow who created Mugs is n't almost an artist . p. 33 KARL ( good-naturedly ) : Funny paper artist . STEPHEN Mugs is alive . KARL Yes , I like him  --  always trying to give people something they do n't want . ( Laughing nervously . ) Everything contributes to Mugs . Got an idea for him driving over here . Mugs running with wild flowers for some flashy mama in a big car . Looking at him she gets stuck in the sand . Can you see them ? She , chic and furious : Mugs , forlornly standing in the ditch , holding out his daisies . Suddenly she beans him with a thermos bottle ! Karl laughs , and Stephen , watching him , laughs as if he were thinking of something else . Luella opens the door . LUELLA I heard voices . ( Sees Karl , knows who he is ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEPHEN ( ironically ) : Luella , your son-in-law . Karl , your mother-in-law . The two look at one another for an instant . LUELLA ( raising a warning finger ) : But do n't you  --  p. 34 KARL ( stopping her , warm , gracious ) : Oh , I could n't . LUELLA ( pleased ) : So you are Karl ! ( Looking up at him as she holds his hands . ) You 're very young , are n't you ? KARL I am so surprised ! LUELLA ( coldly to Stephen ) : You had n't bothered to tell Karl I was here ? Where 's Nina ? ( Excitedly . ) Is Nina here too ? STEPHEN She 's interviewing Wallops . LUELLA Ignoring her own mother ! STEPHEN She did n't know you were here . KARL We just arrived . Quite unexpectedly . LUELLA I was all alone in New York . KARL Oh , that was too bad ! LUELLA I am going to live in New York now . KARL ( doing his best at cordiality ) : That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . p. 35 KARL All right , Mother ! Stephen , frowning , pours himself more whisky . LUELLA ( seeing the bottle ) : I see . The real stuff is kept for the men . STEPHEN ( brusquely ) : Have one , Luella ? ( Goes for another glass . ) LUELLA I do n't usually drink whisky . But such a raw night , and all the excitement  --  ( She lifts her glass . ) To my latest relative . KARL To you  --  may I say Luella ? LUELLA ( giggling ) : Oh , do say Luella . Eleanor , carrying a candle , enters , followed by Nina . Luella hurries to Nina , puts her arms around her big daughter . My little girl ! NINA ( trying to conceal her displeasure , kisses her mother ) : Eleanor just told me you were here . I was so surprised . LUELLA I just could n't wait to see you ! NINA Could n't you ? p. 36 LUELLA ( stepping nearer Karl ) : Karl was glad to see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of that kid ? NINA Oh , Stephen , he 's adorable . I want to steal him ! ( Her beauty glows , all are drawn to her . ) STEPHEN Have your own kid . You ca n't have ours . LUELLA Oh  --  my God ! ( In real panic . ) I 'll not be a a  --  a  --  The others laugh . NINA Picture of Mugs proudly presenting girlish mother-in-law with grandchild ! KARL That 's an idea ! LUELLA One of Nina 's affectionate little ideas . Karl is considering it . As it grows for him his smile grows . KARL It 's an awful funny idea . LUELLA I do n't see the fun in it . NINA Do n't worry about that idea , Mother . KARL Mugs could  --  p. 37 NINA Oh , Karl dear , let 's leave Mugs now . KARL ( confused ) : Sorry . ELEANOR Do n't send him away . Mugs is one of my best friends . KARL ( ruefully to Eleanor ) : Oh , I ca n't send Mugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to work at him every day I 'm here . NINA You 'll catch up . You always do . ( To Stephen . ) What 's Karl to do with our bus ? STEPHEN That nickel-plated pullman car will have to be satisfied with my studio . Nina laughs . It 's a barn , you know . She can have a stable . ELEANOR If it 's big enough . Your car fairly dwarfs this house . NINA Really a very decent car . STEPHEN We 've got a Ford . KARL ( with a quick smile ) : Well , do n't be arrogant about it . ELEANOR Ours is n't an arrogant Ford . It has balloon tyres . Karl , turning to her with a pleased laugh , sits beside her on the sofa . p. 38 KARL I like your room . It 's a lovely old house , is n't it ? ELEANOR Full of unexpected turnings  --  old secrets . I want you to see it all to-morrow . Stephen is seated between Nina and her mother at the table . STEPHEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her mother 's glass ) : No thank you . I do n't drink whisky . Luella laughs , picks up her glass , finishes it . STEPHEN How about a little wine  --  fragrant from the hollows and the hills ? NINA ( turning sweetly to him ) : Your wine ? I 'd love it , Steve . STEPHEN ( he pours for her and for Karl , too , singing  --  so suddenly , everyone turns toward him in surprise ) : There was a young fellow whose name was Karl , He drank and he drank and he drank by the bar'l ! ELEANOR If you do n't stop him he 'll go on all evening . NINA Oh , let him ! Stephen 's wonderful when he gets going . p. 39 KARL Man , that 's good wine ! Pour me some more , Steve . Do n't be tight with it . STEPHEN ( greatly pleased ) : It 's better than industrial alcohol , n'est-ce pas ? Imagine a cop trying to handcuff a grape vine ! The sun and the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say some more , Stephen . STEPHEN If you hear Jovian laughter from the shed back of my studio , fear not . There I keep my barrels , and the new wine is fermenting . The bubbles rise and break and make a hissing sound . Sssssss . I leave my easel a dozen times a day to watch and listen . I feel grateful , and superior , as if every little bubble were helping my side to win . KARL You 've got a good joke on them , have n't you , Steve ? STEPHEN The juice of any fruit that grows will begin to turn into wine as soon as the air and the sun get a look at it . Bubbles rise , and the dullest fellow will dance in the field . KARL Or beat his wife . STEPHEN A lot of wives need it . NINA ( to Karl ) : You 'll be dancing in the field yourself . p. 40 KARL ( just as he is about to drink raises his head ) : Listen . ( Pause . ) What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steamer . KARL Are we so near the sea ? STEPHEN The Atlantic is just behind my studio . ELEANOR You see it from your room upstairs . NINA How fascinating ! LUELLA If you like wine so much I should think you 'd live in Paris . STEPHEN I 'm glad I lived in Paris once . Now I 'm through with that . LUELLA Well , I am through with it myself . NINA ( in self-contained fashion ) : You are ? LUELLA I want the American background now . An angry look at Nina , who has laughed . It 's not dignified to be permanently in Paris . NINA But you wo n't like America . LUELLA Why wo n't I like it ? Karl and Eleanor are occupied with one another . He holds up the wine , noting its clearness . She points to the picture of Mugs and they are laughing . p. 41 NINA ( to Luella ) : Where 'd you park Alice ? LUELLA Marriage has n't toned down your vulgarity . ( With dignity . ) Alice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother is doing her best to keep her there . NINA How lonely she must be ! LUELLA She is in kind hands . NINA I hope she does n't wait and wait for you , as I did . Eleanor and Karl , not wishing to hear this talk , have turned to the driftwood bookshelves . ELEANOR Yes , driftwood from the beach . KARL ( feeling it ) : Carved by the sea . ELEANOR It was Stephen 's idea . They continue to examine it . NINA ( to Luella ) : But , Mother , what are you going to do now ? LUELLA I have a new plan . Steve 's going to help me . STEPHEN I do n't know how much you can count on me , Luella. p. 42 LUELLA Why should n't I count on you ? Karl and Eleanor turn , surprised by her tone . Pause . KARL I like your bookshelves , Steve . STEPHEN After every good blow the beach is strewn for miles . Yesterday pine logs came in  --  ripped off the deck of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . ELEANOR Firewood for us . KARL But these shelves were a long time in the sea . STEPHEN First they were trees in a forest ; then timbers in a ship that sailed the sea a hundred years . The ship died . Taken deep into what it had sailed . The waves tore its bones one from another  --  wind and tides , and the rivers that flow between banks of water took them to a distant beach . On a foggy day , hunting for what I might find , I came upon them , half buried in the sand  --  silver-grey , shining . A new life for the old timbers  --  a life of which they could not have dreamed . In the old house they serve us , and I make a speech to them . . . . They hold out to me a book called the Dance of Life and a book called the Death of a Nobody  --  the books of a Frenchman , an Englishman , a Norwegian . KARL A Chicago poet . p. 43 STEPHEN The pattern is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet it is . Behind the contrast of the moment these timbers were in a tree , and the moment of now is the quality of life . . . . I mean God , of course ; but we are afraid to say God nowadays . LUELLA I thought you were an atheist , Stephen ? STEPHEN Yes , so did I. ( After a pause . ) Let 's pretend that the timbers were made out of a tree that grew near this house . ELEANOR It shaded my great-grandfather ! KARL And longed to enter the cheerful house with him . STEPHEN And finally , here it is ! NINA Oh , Stevie , that 's a nice story . I 've missed your talk . Karl and Eleanor are standing behind , looking at Nina and Stephen . KARL ( resolutely ) : So have I missed it . Comic strips leave something out . NINA ( with a high laugh ) : Rather ! ELEANOR ( quietly ) : I think they take most everything in . But as all turn to her she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles and nods at Paul . p. 44 STEPHEN It is funny how sad the good funnies really are . LUELLA Now I 'm afraid it 's getting beyond me . It 's very well-paid work , is n't it ? KARL Not so bad . LUELLA ( in turning to him she has seen the coat . Rises and picks it up ) : Did it buy this coat ? KARL ( proudly ) : It did . LUELLA ( examining it ) : It 's a beautiful coat . Put it on , Nina . NINA Stephen and Eleanor have seen it , Mother . KARL ( holding it for her ) : But show your mother how becoming it is . ELEANOR ( as Nina looks bored ) : Yes , do , Nina . Nina pulls the collar high , snuggles her chin down into it laughingly , holds out her arms , turning . LUELLA ( excited , to Stephen ) : Is n't she ravishing in fur ? KARL ( proudly , putting his arms around Nina . To Eleanor ) : Will they like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very good coat . KARL Not too good for Nina . NINA Some day I 'll have a sable . Karl 's happiness is hurt Stephen and Eleanor are silent , as if something has happened . Nina , feeling she has made a mistake , takes off the coat , throws it aside . Nobody says anything to help her . She sits by Stephen . Sweetly : What can I do to get another glass of your good wine , Steve ? He pours it for her without comment . LUELLA ( plaintively ) : Do n't any of you people play bridge ? Curtain . @x ACT II Scene I Time : Next morning . After eleven o'clock . Scene : Stephen 's studio in the big barn . At back , a little to the left , a sliding door partly open ; at back centre a window . Ground slopes up to the back gable of the house , a hundred yards away . From the north light which has been cut into the slanting roof , only partially visible , comes a clear diffused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a September day . A grasshopper whirs . Square oaken timbers , a very large easel standing straight and heavy , a little right of centre . Walls are bare , whitewashed boards . The prow of an old boat protrudes from right . An anchor leans forgotten in a corner . Red branches in a jug ; on a table an arrangement of bright vegetables , a wine bottle and a pitcher for a still life . There are two straight chairs ; a sea-chest under the window serves as a bench . On a model 's platform , raised a foot from the floor , left of centre , back , is an old arm-chair . On a barrel at right of the easel is Stephen 's colour-box and a glass of long brushes . The upright and horizontal beams , the diffused light , the glimpse of slanting roof , give to this barn the space , shadows , quiet of an old church . Stephen in shirt sleeves , old trousers , tennis slippers , holds a large palette in left hand , a brush in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so his painting is not seen . Eleanor , in a cheerful print frock , sits in the chair on the model stand . She holds an earthen jar of graceful form . STEPHEN ( with a last touch ) : You can rest now . p. 47 ELEANOR ( relaxing ) : I love the feel of this old jug . Who do you suppose made it ? STEPHEN ( cleaning brushes ) : Some rural Puritan a hundred years ago . ( Respectfully . ) Some lost Greek . Tired ? ELEANOR No . But I must get back to the house . ( Stepping to the easel . ) It 's strong , Stephen . The colour 's richer now . Pause , as both look at canvas . She is a strange , wise woman . She is n't me . STEPHEN ( smearing something on the canvas with his thumb , wiping the thumb on his trousers , head cocked , one eye closed ) : Is n't she ? Perhaps she does n't look much like you . Still , there 's a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloof , controlled . ELEANOR ( mockingly ) : A strong , silent woman . STEPHEN A strong , mysterious woman . ELEANOR Oh , dear ! Suppose I were to say there is no mystery ? STEPHEN You would n't . But if you did I would n't believe it . He is scraping his palette , cleaning brushes , quickly , expertly . As they talk there is little conflict between them , nor are they playing a game . One feels how close they are to an understanding . There is a humorous , gently cynical resignation in this . p. 48 ELEANOR ( almost plaintively ) : Just this morning I wanted to know what life means . STEPHEN ( laughing ) : Why , Eleanor ! ELEANOR ( still earnest ) : I was in the garden . The sun made the back of my neck warm . I was thinking about how Wallops fell out of his chair at breakfast , reaching for something too far away . He terribly bumped his head . When I give him all he needs , why should he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new places , even after he gets hurt a dozen times ? And there in the garden , all of a sudden  --  as some people are eager to know who will win the football game or who killed Dr. Hall , I was eager to know what life means ! You think anybody knows ? STEPHEN You do , sometimes . ELEANOR ( quickly ) : Oh , no ! STEPHEN Remember climbing down to the wild cherrytree in Higgins ' Hollow ? Branches sunk to the ground with the long clusters  --  a glittering light on every little black cherry , stems red and glossy dark leaves . You looked and could not say a word , the sun pouring over the tree that stood there all by itself , in its gesture of giving  --  giving  --  to the sky and the birds , to you and me . . . ( Pause . ) Finally you said : " Oh , little tree , I love you . " Well , take your question into Higgins ' Hollow . Say , " Little tree , what does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent . STEPHEN And beautiful . ELEANOR That is n't enough . STEPHEN ( unwillingly ) : No , it is n't . ELEANOR Beauty says something to us . What does it say ? STEPHEN There 's no answer to that ! " I am the wings . . I am  --  " ELEANOR I hate that poem . It is just words . STEPHEN That 's what you 're asking for  --  words . ELEANOR I believe in Wallops . He is real . STEPHEN To you . ELEANOR ( firmly ) : To us . STEPHEN Well  --  yes . No . ( Cups his hands . ) Now we 've got the main difference between you and me almost in our hands . I am not sure of anything . ELEANOR ( an affirmation of faith ) : Wallops is real . STEPHEN When he 's a big Wallops and one day pauses as we pause now to ask what is real , will he say , " I , Wallops , am real ? " p. 50 ELEANOR I hope he does n't ask . STEPHEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , but if you do n't ask it , you 're a beast in the field . ( With the emphasis of discovery . ) Life is like Karl 's comic strips . The question to ask is not What is truth ? but , What is truth like ? It 's like a comic strip . ( Changing . ) I am afraid for Karl . ELEANOR He is n't well , is he ? STEPHEN ( as if hurt himself ) : She hurts him . The mention of Nina has changed them . ELEANOR She 's very young . She was lovely with Wallops last night . And Karl loves her . It 's as if he were too slight for so flaming a love . STEPHEN She is vain and cruel . I know that family . ELEANOR Yes . STEPHEN Too well . ELEANOR I had n't realized  --  STEPHEN " Some day I 'll have a sable . " ELEANOR That was horrid . STEPHEN Well , what are we going to do about it ? p. 51 ELEANOR Do ? We ? STEPHEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big money . For her to spend . Karl does n't care about a lot of things to clutter up his life . He ca n't stand that frantic competition , nor the winters . But she does n't give him a thought . ( Savagely . ) I wish she 'd leave him . I wish we could make him see her  --  just once . ( He thinks sombrely . ) I 'd like to do it  --  somehow . ELEANOR Stephen ! Surely you 're not serious ? Why do n't you see ? Karl has something real ! STEPHEN Real ? She 's false . ELEANOR It is n't what you think she is . Or even  --  what she is . STEPHEN Karl 's headed for disaster . ( Angrily . ) I tell you something must be done . ELEANOR ( very seriously ) : What do you mean ? What could we do ? We ca n't help people who are tangled together as Karl and Nina are . They themselves must work it out , somehow , some time . Or never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloof . What do you mean by saying we ca n't help others ? What a cold-blooded doctrine ! p. 52 ELEANOR In the way I mean it , it is the simple truth . STEPHEN ( loudly ) : It is not ! You withdraw from life  --  calm  --  hoarding your strength . ELEANOR Do I ? ( Looking at him curiously . ) I 'm not sure I do . Anyway , now I must hoard my time . No telling what Mary 's about in the kitchen . ( At the door . ) I 'll come back later if you need me . STEPHEN What shall we do about Karl ? ELEANOR ( quietly ) : Not so loud , Stephen . Karl may be here any minute . Why , we 'll do nothing about Karl . STEPHEN ( fiercely ) : I will ! I 'll do anything ! ELEANOR ( firmly ) : Not a word to Karl ! STEPHEN She has n't given us a moment together yet ! ELEANOR But you 'll have a good visit with him now . STEPHEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELEANOR ( suddenly laughing ) : Why , Steve , I believe you 're jealous of her . ( Goes out . From outside . ) Here 's Karl now . ( To Karl . ) Steve 's waiting to show you his studio . p. 53 KARL I 'm keen to see it . ( Standing in the door , very well dressed , in grey , collar of his shirt open , bareheaded . ) Hello , Steve ! Working ? STEPHEN Come in , Karl . Been doing something of Eleanor . Do n't look at it . KARL ( after looking ) : Damn good . You look at things in your own way  --  even at your wife . It 's a clear , new way . STEPHEN ( embarrassed , feeling he does n't deserve so much ) : Once I thought I could be  --  you know , Giotto and Michael Angelo at once . I 'm beginning to know better . Oh , I 'm not crying over it . I feel a bit relieved . There 's less responsibility in mediocrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in fun . STEPHEN ( cheerfully ) : Anyway , you 've got all the talent in the family . KARL Oh , shut up ! Got any recent stuff ? STEPHEN It 's buried deep up there . I 'll get it out tomorrow . Smoke ? KARL ( regretfully ) : Sorry , I can't. p. 54 STEPHEN Oh ! Been on the beach ? KARL ( laughing nervously ) : I got in three hours of work this morning . I was up long before all you sleepy-heads . Then Nina and I drove down the Cape , and when I got back Luella was up and wanted to go to Wellfleet , and when I left her , I hurried down here , so you see  --  ( He walks nervously about the studio . ) STEPHEN It 's about time you sat down , is n't it ? ( Shoves a chair forward . ) KARL ( not looking at it ) : Thanks . What do you think of Luella ? Stephen shrugs . KARL I agree with you . Have you ever noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be solemnly divided into little pleasures . You 're to play bridge this evening . STEPHEN ( slowly ) : Like hell I am . KARL ( laughing ) : You have n't changed so much . ( Pause . ) You seem happy , Steve ; and  --  secure . STEPHEN Yes , I 'm comfortable . p. 55 KARL Comfort has n't done for you , and I suppose comfort is the test . STEPHEN Please sit down , Karl . Rest . Karl sits . STEPHEN Do you play bridge ? KARL Yes , now and again . Nina likes the game . ( Loyally . ) So do I. Down there we belonged to a country club . STEPHEN You did ? KARL ( laughing at Stephen 's shock ) : It was all right . Nina liked it so much . She is wonderful  --  the kick she gets out of dressing up and going off to tea at some swell place . ( With affection and admiration . ) She 's so impetuous and headstrong . Wants her own way , and gets it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to come here just now . STEPHEN Why , Karl ! KARL Oh , I was keen to see you and Eleanor , but so much work , the trip will put me further behind . I was for seeing you in New York later on . But Nina put her foot down . So you have her to thank for the visit  --  if you feel grateful . STEPHEN I ca n't tell you , old man , how glad I am to have you here . p. 56 KARL Nothing changes things between you and me . Is n't that true ? STEPHEN ( earnestly ) : Yes , that 's true . Silence . KARL Nina often talks of you . STEPHEN Once in Paris I drove Nina and Luella clear out to Robinson 's in an old horse-barouche . KARL ( laughing with constraint ) : Yes , I know . The grownup daughter , suddenly over from America , was awkward for Luella ! ( Imitating Luella . ) " Mr. Rolf , my sister Nina ! " STEPHEN ( remembering ) : So Nina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her mother away the very next day ? KARL It was n't kind , was it ? STEPHEN One could hardly blame her . KARL Luella can . Just this morning she was complaining of how selfish Nina had been in Paris . STEPHEN ( bored with Luella ) : According to Luella , Luella 's father , mother , her husbands , children , you , me , and Tony the coastguard all are selfish . p. 57 KARL What happened to the last husband ? STEPHEN A French girl happened to him . He and Luella had quarrelled over money . The quarter rang with her charges of ingratitude and selfishness . Karl nervously gets up and walks about . KARL One feels sorry for her , but wants to feel sorry at a good distance . STEPHEN She 's got a new scheme  --  a Ye old shoppe . KARL She told me . Do n't you bother , she 's my mother-in-law . STEPHEN How much have you been helping Luella ? KARL Not much . ( He is exploring the studio . ) Grand studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sits again ) : Wish father were alive . He would like it here . STEPHEN Yes , he would . And Eleanor . She is serious and straightforward , as father was . KARL ( loyally ) : He would have liked Nina , too , I think . STEPHEN Oh , yes ! p. 58 KARL Driving up here , I kept thinking of all the things I 'd have to tell you . STEPHEN What 's the new job ? KARL Twice as much work and a hell of a lot of money  --  for me , it 's a lot . STEPHEN You 'll need it  --  in New York . ( Pause . ) I think you 're trying to do too much . KARL My audience is growing so fast . Two hundred dailies use my stuff now . I get letters from all sorts of people . They talk as if Mugs were a living person . STEPHEN He 's as real as we are ! KARL Well , he does n't get older . STEPHEN Are n't you afraid you 'll hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff  --  it 'll be thin . KARL I am afraid of that . But what can I do ? It 's grow or quit . Once you 've started serving the crowd , you 've got to take orders from it . STEPHEN An artist should serve his own instincts . KARL A comic artist serving himself is a comic idea . STEPHEN It 's a sound idea . p. 59 KARL I wonder if it is ? STEPHEN How many comic artists go to pieces ? KARL ( grinning ) : The percentage is higher than among aviators , I 'd say . Still , a crash is n't so likely to be fatal . STEPHEN Why not wait a year ? KARL ( shakes his head , coughs ) : Ca n't be done . STEPHEN Nina put her foot down . KARL ( earnestly ) : Oh , you 're wrong , Steve ! A constrained silence . STEPHEN I 'm sorry . But I do know her . KARL Yes , I know . Stephen looks quickly into his brother 's guarded face . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lonely for Nina , though . ( Cheerfully . ) In New York I 'll think of you having this good light and space , and this heavenly quiet . A screen door bangs angrily . Both men start . STEPHEN Damn that screen door ! KARL ( frowns , goes nervously to window at back to look across the yard to the back of the house ) : Nina is coming . p. 60 NINA ( from outside , excited , irritated voice ) : Karl ! Karl ! Where are you ? ( She bursts in angrily . ) STEPHEN You seem concerned about something . KARL Do you want me ? NINA Have you forgotten we were going swimming before lunch ? It was selfish of you to keep me waiting half an hour . KARL ( glancing at his watch ) : Your watch must be fast , Nina . It 's only ten after twelve . NINA " Only " ten minutes ! You know how I detest waiting ! ( Changing , as Stephen turns his back on them . ) Oh , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . ) Let 's look at Stephen 's picture . STEPHEN ( turning ) : Oh , please . NINA You made her look old enough . ( Looking about the barn . ) What a romantic place ! STEPHEN Eleanor 's great grand-dad was a farmer , a sailor , and very likely a smuggler , too . p. 61 NINA What have you men been talking about ? STEPHEN Ourselves . KARL About Karl , mostly . NINA Oh ! STEPHEN It 's too cold for swimming , anyway . NINA I love it on days like this . ( To Karl . ) Karl dear , Luella  --  I mean mother  --  is waiting for me to come back . Would you mind telling her I 'm staying out here a little while ? ( Prettily . ) It 's mean of me , is n't it ? KARL ( patting her shoulder ) : It 's all right . ( Starts to go . ) NINA ( softly ) : Would you mind taking a walk with her ? She 'd love it ! Along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , Nina . NINA ( warmly ) : You 're so good , Karl . KARL See you later , Steve . ( He goes. ) p. 62 NINA ( waving from doorway ) : ' Bye , dear . ( She looks for a chair , sees that on model 's stand , moves the jug Eleanor left on floor beside the chair . ) NINA I have n't seen you at work since Paris . STEPHEN The Rue de Lambre studio . Five flights , but what a view ! NINA The Tour d'Eiffel , about this high ( indicating two inches ) , right in the middle of the big window . Your tin bathtub was always tripping people in the hall . STEPHEN What was on the corner ? NINA A stoppage place  --  two women for ever sewing in the window . STEPHEN The other corner ? NINA ( trying to remember ) : Wait . Do n't tell me . ( Delighted . ) A horse butcher 's ! STEPHEN You 'll know this one  --  what was in the middle of the block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands ) : Too easy ! The pastry shop ! Oh , raspberry tarts ! ( Suddenly wistful . ) You were painting my picture then . p. 63 STEPHEN Was I ? Oh , now I remember  --  sitting down kind of sprawled out  --  scarlet stockings , arms listless , a black discontented expression . ( With an artist 's vague zigzag gesture . ) Nice arrangement  --  NINA ( wistfully ) : You never finished it . STEPHEN ( not regretting it ) : No , it was in an earlier manner of mine  --  wild . NINA ( carefully ) : I 'd sit for you now . ( Hastily . ) Oh , but you 've got such a good start on that other . STEPHEN That makes no difference . One does n't have too many models up here in the wilds . ( Examining the picture of Eleanor again  --  impersonally . Takes it off easel , sets it on floor , against the wall , face inward . Puts new canvas on easel . Is soon busy with a bit of charcoal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my surprise at finding mother here . STEPHEN She does n't look a day older . NINA ( laughing ) : The same old compliment . She gets so tired of it . The day somebody says to me , " How young you look ! " I 'll know I no longer look young ! When people say I have beautiful hair , I wonder what 's the matter with the rest of me . In Paris you were wonderful ; you did n't say a word about my hair  --  not at first . You said I had a brilliant mind ! p. 64 STEPHEN ( amazed ) : Did I really ! NINA Yes , you did . ( Chuckling . ) Mother was jealous . STEPHEN She 'll miss it when people stop saying how young she looks . NINA And I when my hair is grey , you mean ! But , boy ! Now I 'm young ! You have settled down , have n't you ? STEPHEN Have I ? NINA You and Eleanor seem happy . STEPHEN ( slightly hesitant ) : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ? NINA I was happiest in Paris . STEPHEN You used to say you hated Paris . NINA I was a little fool . ( Looking to the window . ) It must be lonely here . There is n't anything to do . STEPHEN ( sharply , impersonally ) : Do n't turn your head for a moment . Nothing to do ? There are hundreds of things to do ! p. 65 NINA ( piqued by the brusque order ) : Painting , I suppose . What is the good of painting all the time ? STEPHEN I 'm not sure I know . NINA Is n't life better than painting it ? STEPHEN You 've asked a question ! NINA ( pleased at being taken seriously ) : Anyway , you ca n't paint what you see , can you ? STEPHEN No . Not really you ca n't . It always gets away . NINA Then why must men spend their lives trying to do the impossible ? STEPHEN Most men do n't . You 've forgotten brokers , subway guards . NINA ( suddenly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEPHEN You 're sorry you married Karl ? NINA Oh , I do n't mean it , of course . Karl 's very good to me . STEPHEN Karl has the sure  --  NINA ( lightly ) : Now do n't start bragging about your brother , Stephen . Let 's agree that Karl is good , kind , generous , honest , pure of heart , and that I am very lucky to have him , and then let 's talk about something else . p. 66 STEPHEN But you say it as if you did n't mean it . NINA ( sharply ) : I know you all feel I am selfish and unkind , and bad for Karl . Stephen stops drawing and stares at her . Karl has everything . ( Bitterly . ) He can make himself laugh with his own funny pictures . STEPHEN Eleanor said she had never seen a man in love as Karl is in love with you . NINA Oh , she is jealous , is she ? STEPHEN ( coldly ) : No , I think not . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she has not touched him , that she is merely something to be used . ) NINA Oh , maybe she is n't too superior to be jealous . STEPHEN In this house of her past , with Wallops , yes , and with me , Eleanor is complete . She is not jealous of anyone . NINA And you  --  you are not  --  complete ? STEPHEN ( shrugging ) : I am a man . NINA Oh , Stephen ! I hear your voice in Karl 's voice every day . " What do you think , Karl ? " I ask ; and he replies , " Well , Stephen , would say  --  " p. 67 STEPHEN ( not drawing ) : After father , I was father . Karl is too generous to see he knows more than his elder brother . Karl has genius . NINA Oh , if we must talk about Karl , let 's talk about Karl . What have I to do with his genius ? STEPHEN ( struck by the truth of this ) : But you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antics for Mugs in everything  --  in what I do , even . If Karl bumps into a chair he does n't curse , he laughs and says , " That would be something for Mugs to do ! " He gives me what 's left after Mugs is done . ( Insincerely , seeing that now she has aroused Stephen , perhaps more than she wished . ) Oh , do n't listen to me . I do n't mean half I 'm saying . Karl is good to me . STEPHEN ( irritated by the repetition of this niggardly phrase ) : All he makes from Mugs goes to you , does n't it ? NINA There , you see ? ( With a gesture , as to a third person , an angry jeer in her voice . ) STEPHEN ( tries to draw ; rubs out the stroke with his thumb ; in an irritated voice ) : He spends nothing on himself . But for you  --  a millionaire 's car , country clubs  --  p. 68 NINA ( in a mocking imitation of melodrama ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NINA ( venomously , half knowing how horrid it is , but determined to reach this calm man ) : He knows how many others there are who would give me more ! STEPHEN ( stares at her , with a deliberate , calm gesture throws his charcoal away ; speaks softly ) : What a rotten thing to say ! NINA It 's the truth ! STEPHEN ( his voice scarcely raised ) : Do you know what it was you said ? NINA ( hesitant , seeing that her words have done more than she had expected ) : Yes . STEPHEN ( coldly , quietly ) : I suppose you would sell yourself ? NINA Do n't make phrases ! STEPHEN ( throwing it at her , anger twisting his face ) : You whore ! NINA ( cowers in her chair , then leaps to her feet there on the model 's stand , mad with rage ) : God damn you ! You 're my judge , are you ! You ! YOU ! p. 69 STEPHEN Others would give you more ! NINA ( deaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! STEPHEN So that 's why you 're going to New York ! NINA ( in one quick , sweeping movement seizes Eleanor 's jar from the floor , raises it with both hands high above her head , and with all her strength throws it at Stephen . It smashes against the wall with a loud noise . As if this noise snapped the tension within her , Nina steps from the model stand , sinks to the floor , and sitting , her face covered , weeps passionately . Incoherently ) : Oh , my God ! STEPHEN ( stepping nearer , reaching uncertainly for her ) : Nina , Nina . . . NINA ( sobbing ) : I spoil everything . ( Wildly . ) Hit me , Stephen ! Hit me ! STEPHEN ( profoundly distressed ) : Nina  --  dear , do n't , do n't . ( Touches her shoulder . ) NINA ( passionately grasping the hand with both of hers , holding it against her face ) : I 'm sorry , Stephen . I 'm sorry . p. 70 STEPHEN Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen . ( Reaching for him with her arms outstretched , lifting her tear-blinded face . ) I 'm selfish , I 'm cruel , and everybody shuts me out . Do n't shut me out , Stephen . Not again ! Not again ! STEPHEN ( stoops and helps her to stand ) : Nina , Nina . NINA ( with a quick movement so that his arms are around her ) : When I try to do right I am wicked . I try to say good things and ( sobbing again ) toads come from my mouth . Hold me , Stephen . STEPHEN ( dully , as he drops his arms and moves to get away from her ) : Help you ? NINA ( with deep passion ) : I love you , Stephen . I 've always loved you . ELEANOR ( at the door ) : Stephen ! Nina , with savage , incoherent exclamation , whips around away from the door , concealing her face . A moment in which no one moves or speaks ; then Nina goes rapidly out , passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( exhausted , dazed ) : Well ? ELEANOR Karl 's wife ! Stephen turns away . If Karl had heard ! STEPHEN ( trying to convince himself ) : He should have heard ! I told you an hour ago I 'd do anything to save him from her ! ELEANOR Stephen , you 're mad ! STEPHEN ( calm at last ) : She is destroying him . He must be made to see ! ELEANOR ( holding up her hand ) : Just putting it into words is dangerous ! STEPHEN He is my brother ! ELEANOR She said she loved you ! STEPHEN She knows as much about love as  --  Luella McClure ! ELEANOR Yes  --  Luella . Was n't she enough ? STEPHEN ( turning slowly towards her , amazed ) : What ? ELEANOR Did you think you had concealed it ? STEPHEN Concealed what ? p. 72 ELEANOR ( impatiently ) : That Luella was your mistress in Paris . STEPHEN Luella was never my mistress . ELEANOR Luella was not  --  STEPHEN Not Luella . Nina . ELEANOR ( unable to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , but that is impossible ! STEPHEN ( sullenly ) : Why . . . impossible ? ELEANOR She was a child . STEPHEN She was a woman . ELEANOR She was no more than seventeen . ( As he does not answer . ) Stephen ! Seventeen , and you seduced her ? STEPHEN Let 's keep our heads ! That 's not the word for what happened to me  --  to us  --  in Paris ! ELEANOR ( it grows on her ) : You were a friend of her mother . STEPHEN That mother ! ELEANOR The more reason to take care of the daughter . p. 73 STEPHEN Nina had no intention of being taken care of . ( As she does not move . ) I 'm sorry , Eleanor  --  that it should come this way  --  now , here . ELEANOR Oh , Stephen ! STEPHEN Why , dear , you surely knew I was n't alone  --  all that time in Paris . ELEANOR Does Karl know ? STEPHEN I think not . Maybe . I urged him not to marry her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! STEPHEN They 'll be gone soon . ELEANOR ( low ) : Gone ! Will it ever be gone ? STEPHEN Luella is going this afternoon , is n't she ? ELEANOR ( her eye falls on the shattered jug , the passion she has controlled now suddenly released ) : Who broke that jug ? Stephen , looking stupidly at the fragments , half bends to pick them up . ( In high anger . ) Did that woman do it ? STEPHEN ( unconvincingly ) : I  --  I bumped against it . We 'll get another . p. 74 ELEANOR You ca n't get another . It had always been here . It belonged here . STEPHEN I am sorry . ELEANOR ( coldly ) : Oh , it does not matter . STEPHEN ( timidly ) : I 've got it almost painted in . Eleanor 's eyes fall on the easel . ELEANOR ( after a slight pause ) : You have started something new . STEPHEN A sketch . She asked me to . Nina 's voice , more cheerful , clearer than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down to the studio and tell them Mary says lunch is ready . ( Her laugh , loving and warm , in a lower tone ) : Dear , good Karl ! Curtain . p. 75 Act 2 , Scene 2 Scene 2 Eleanor on the steps before the studio . The big sliding door of the old barn is closed behind her . This door is at an end of the building , so that only a corner is seen . To the right , back , one of the gabled wings of the house , one branch of a great tree reaching over it . This from time to time rustles in a wind from the sea . We do not see Eleanor clearly , for it is dusk . She is wearing a cape , and is bending over a large kettle . She takes beach-plums from a basket above her and lets them fall into this kettle . She has an old-fashioned wooden potato-masher , and begins to crush them . But she stops after a moment , arm leaning on her knee , chin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , takes down lantern which hangs before the door . Lighting this , she puts it near her on the steps . Bends over the large receptacle with which she is working , stirs it . Hears something , raises her head , though still bent forward . Footsteps . ELEANOR ( calling as one who has been anxiously waiting ) : Stephen ? That you , Stephen ? KARL No , Eleanor  --  it 's Karl . ( He comes across from left . ) ELEANOR Oh  --  Karl . Been down on the beach ? p. 76 KARL It 's tremendous down there as night comes . Makes one a little afraid . ELEANOR I know . KARL And walking up this old sand road , through tall grasses blowing in the mist . It was nice to see your lantern , like a little circle of safety in the strange night . Or is it you , Eleanor ? ELEANOR Me ? KARL Makes that circle . She moves over for him , but he does not sit down . You were a nice picture , bent over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . ELEANOR Brewing jelly . I would n't brew destinies . KARL ( with not quite natural carelessness ) : Where 's everybody ? ELEANOR Taking a walk , I believe . KARL ( sitting down and examining it ) : This is a curious old lantern . ELEANOR An old ship 's lantern . It was here in the barn . I think it belonged to my great-grandfather . KARL Then it sent its light into some pretty stormy places , did n't it ? p. 77 ELEANOR There does seem something valiant about the good old thing . KARL ( who is still leaning into the light of it , examining ) : It was good  --  your coming back to this old place . ELEANOR I never felt at home in New York . I was born and brought up there , but I never took root . KARL I was thinking to-day , walking through an abandoned orchard , it must have been a good life they had here . Why did they leave it ? ELEANOR Time 's changed . Grandfather went from whales into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't really an answer . They left here to make money . But what could money buy better than the place they left ? ( Slight pause . ) I do n't know why people who get on think they must live in New York . KARL ( rather to himself ) : Maybe we do n't know either . ELEANOR Stephen was tired of cities , too . The country drew us together , as the country can when you 're in the city , so I said , " Let 's look up the old place on the Cape . " It had been sold to Portuguese , but we bought it back . They made us pay for it , too . Now , as we can afford it , we 're buying back old things that were in it . Karl laughs . Yes , it is a funny story . p. 78 KARL They 'd be surprised , would n't they ? ELEANOR I hope they 'd be glad . When I discover an old tool , they seem in life again . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his children . Perhaps not . He may want to live in Chicago . KARL But his children might come and buy it back . ELEANOR ( laughing too ) : They just might . Anyway , I owed it to the place itself . Particularly at this time of year , I know I belong here . ( She takes beach-plums from the basket , examines , and puts them in the kettle . ) I like to go out and find the things that grew all through the time the land was alone . I like bringing them into the house and doing the same old things . ( Letting them fall from her hands unexamined , her hands resting on the sides of the kettle . Pushing it from her . ) But now I 'm a little tired of the beach-plums . KARL Perhaps we should n't have come here . ELEANOR Do n't say that . KARL I fear we do n't  --  belong here . ELEANOR You do belong here , Karl . You  --  ( Stops , confused. ) p. 79 KARL I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She tires you , does n't she ? ELEANOR She wanted me to play double Canfield with her , but I ran away . It was bad of me  --  leaving her alone . KARL Then Luella is not  --  taking a walk ? ELEANOR No . I believe not . Karl puts hand in his pocket ; when he takes it out something is in his hand . He seems unconscious of it at first . He whistles a little , as a man may when uncertain , disturbed . Eleanor , too , is uncertain . One arm reaches over her big kettle . KARL ( striving for cheerful unconcern ) : Jolly night . I like a night like this when you have the stars and the wind bats little clouds around as if it were a game . ( Holds up what he has in his hand ; after looking at it passes it to Eleanor . ) I found it on the beach . ELEANOR For me ? KARL Oh , sorry , Eleanor . I brought it for Nina . Thought it might amuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? p. 80 KARL You see him , too ? Yes , a comical little man , smiling in the sand . ( Pleasure going . ) It 's just a bit of driftwood . ( He holds out his hand for it , but Eleanor is still regarding it . ) ELEANOR I like your comical little man Mugs . I like him best of all your pictures . KARL I like him best , too . ELEANOR Always trying to give people things they do n't want . Laughs a little ; hands back the comical little man made by the sea . He puts it in his breast pocket . I do n't know why I have it so strongly  --  this feeling that we ca n't give each other things . Do things , I mean . Step into each other 's lives . Maybe it 's just selfishness . Stephen tells me that sometimes . KARL ( drily ) : Stephen tells you your motives are selfish ? ELEANOR They do n't  --  ( with a little laugh ) feel that way to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to know much about motives . They come from places we do n't  --  turn a light on . Karl moves the lantern , as if this has made him know the light is hurting his eyes . p. 81 ELEANOR ( gently ) : You can turn it down , Karl . ( Takes it , as he does not know how . ) Your eyes must be tired . KARL ( putting his hands to his eyes ) : So many black lines . ELEANOR You worked steadily all afternoon . ( After she has turned down the lantern and there is only the dim light from the house . ) Now we can see the stars  --  through your lively little clouds . KARL One night , driving home with father  --  he had lost the man he tried to save , and we did n't talk , but saw things ; there were these same clouds  --  blowing across the stars . No , not the same clouds . But the same stars . Together they look , in silence . You would have liked father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know much about life . All I know is I 've loved a few people . Loved them more than myself . I 'm not handing myself anything there . It ought n't to be that way  --  something ridiculous about it . I wanted to be a doctor because father was a doctor . Wanted to go on doing something for people he had helped . But before I could begin I got the fever myself . ( Laughs , as at a funny picture . ) But anyhow , I was n't fit to be a doctor . You should see my old medical books . You ca n't ; I burned ' em . I was ashamed of them . All the margins were funny pictures  --  skeletons jazzed up with manikins cracking each other over the head . Gee , it would have seemed trivial to a scientific man . So when I could n't be a doctor , like father , I wanted to be an artist , like Stephen . A copycat , I guess . Might start a copycat series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . ) Would the copycat really be a cat ? A person , maybe . No , it might say more about a person if it were a cat . Cats are nice to draw . ( Takes pencil and paper from his pocket , and , bending low to see in the dim light , begins to draw. ) p. 82 ELEANOR You 're not a copycat , Karl . You are yourself . KARL ( as if he has just thought of it , looking up as if he has something on her , on everyone ) : Yes , but where did myself come from ? Somewhere . I 'm copycatting something I do n't see . Maybe it 's all copycatting . What about you and your beach-plums ? They laugh a little . He slips the paper back in his pocket . Where was I ? Father . After father , Stephen . Really , most of all  --  Stephen . Father was a  --  little too far away . So many years were in between . ELEANOR I know . When I look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freer . He was my big brother , who could do everything . His songs made me all warm inside . If I had been a cat I would have purred . When Stephen painted a tree , then I could see a tree . Hills became hills because he made hills . ELEANOR ( low , frightened ) : Oh , Karl ! KARL It was Stephen showed me how beautiful Nina was . ( With a reckless laugh . ) Yes  --  talk about copycatting . Of course I could see  --  what anyone could see . But Steve 's talk about her beauty  --  how , here , embodied , was the dream of beauty  --  imperishable ideal for which men had destroyed themselves ! You know  --  funny thing  --  I did n't like Nina very well at first . p. 83 ELEANOR ( uncertain voice ) : You did n't , Karl ? KARL I suppose I was jealous . I had come to New York to be with Steve . I 'd had the fever . Everything seemed different . And he was always having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You knew that Nina and Steve had been friends ? ELEANOR ( slight pause ) : Yes . KARL ( in a voice resolutely more matter-of-fact ) : Steve was painting her . I came into the studio one day when they had quarrelled . The blaze of it lighted what Stephen had said . I loved her . Eleanor moves as if about to speak . Karl waits , but she does not speak . The more I loved Nina ( laughs ) , the more I could love Stephen . ELEANOR And Stephen loves you , Karl . KARL I always believed he did . ELEANOR Keep believing it . We have to have faith . If we ca n't draw and draw upon it  --  as plants from the earth  --  KARL Not easy , sometimes . p. 84 ELEANOR I know that . It gets so mixed . We 're not one thing , but many things . KARL Yep . Some of ' em things we do n't want to be . ELEANOR Then one part of us knocks the real us on the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do one thing , and say it 's another . How hard we work at fooling ourselves ! KARL That could be a strip , too . ELEANOR A strip you could keep going a long time . See ? ( Pointing . ) That 's what you like , is n't it ? The wind blew a little cloud in two , revealing the star . After they have watched it . My grandmother was religious , in the way of her time . I do n't know that the words meant a great deal to her , but when I was a little girl I heard her say them , and now they sometimes come of themselves , as if they 'd sunk into life and  --  like Stephen 's wine  --  been fermenting all this time . " Now we see through a glass darkly , but one day we shall see face to face . " And when we see , what will we see , Karl ? I 'd give so much to know . Sometimes it seems just too silly not to know . KARL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85 ELEANOR ( timidly ) : And because we are  --  all in the same fix  --  we must have sympathy one with another , do n't you think ? People together in a thick fog would n't blame each other for stumbling . KARL They would , I fear . I can hear their ridiculous curses . ELEANOR ( her voice feeling its way ) : There 's something in us  --  no one can hurt . No one can reach . Perhaps we should know that . Perhaps we should not refuse to know it . In words  --  no . We ca n't put it into words . But it 's  --  loyalty . KARL Loyalty  --  to what ? ELEANOR ( after thinking ) : To what stops us with wonder in the fields . To what we see through the glass darkly , and may see face to face . KARL ( after dwelling with this , turns away ) : No . Not for me . ( Turning back with low passion . ) I could n't lose Nina . I could n't live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right for you . I 'll like to have it to think about , as I 'll like to remember that star . But me  --  perhaps it 's being a man  --  being younger  --  ( Almost petulently . ) You want to be reached  --  even reached to be hurt ! p. 86 ELEANOR ( voice averted ) : And what if you do want to ? KARL Something that ca n't be destroyed ? You want to give that  --  as a last gift . ELEANOR What makes you think I do n't know that ? Of course you want to . Let the flames be the beautiful flames ! And at the last they leave  --  what they found . That 's one of the funny things  --  the funniest , maybe . KARL ( intensely ) : You do n't see Nina . Of course not  --  how could you ? Nina  --  in love  --  oh , you do n't have to wonder what it 's all about ! That 's what it 's all about ! ELEANOR ( with pain ) : I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great gift  --  as fire from heaven ! I 'd like to bring it to you  --  to you , Eleanor , as an offering , as the meaning and beauty of earth ! ELEANOR ( voice shaking ) : Do n't be ridiculous , Karl . KARL ( her voice has turned him to her ) : Do people give you things ? ELEANOR ( low , laughing , crying ) : I do n't know . p. 87 KARL We ought to give you things . What can I give you ? ( With feeling and humorously . ) I have n't anything to offer you . Well , nothing except  --  my trust . ELEANOR ( quickly ) : Do n't do that . ( Pause . ) I would n't " do " anything . KARL You do n't have to do anything . But I 'll say to myself  --  there 's Eleanor . Eleanor 's head has gone down , she is sobbing . Why , Eleanor . ( After a helpless moment . ) What a way to receive a present . ELEANOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here too long in the queer night . Let 's go in the house and  --  play bridge with Luella . KARL Right . Let 's make a jolly big fire , and get warm . ELEANOR Get some wood , Karl . You know , right around this corner of the studio . KARL ( rising ) : Yep . I know . ELEANOR Want the lantern ? KARL Do n't believe I need it . After he has left Eleanor reaches out for the lantern . One hand on it , her head sinks to her other hand . Low sounds . Swiftly raises her head . Nina 's voice . The passionate whisper : " All of that  --  what does it matter ! It 's us . It 's now . " A frightened murmur from Eleanor . Stephen 's voice , breathing passion : " Nina ! My beautiful Nina ! " Eleanor rises , the lantern in her hand , holding it high , she turns it up . It finds Stephen and Nina just within the circle of light . She is in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! STEPHEN ( whirling angrily ) : Who turned  --  ? ( Incredulous . ) Eleanor . ELEANOR ( so shaken the words barely come ) : I  --  to warn you  --  Karl is  --  A crash . On the other side of the circle of light the wood has fallen from Karl 's arms . NINA Oh , that 's good , Karl ! What a good idea for Mugs ! Mugs can drop the wood ! STEPHEN ( low , outraged ) : Nina . LUELLA ( from the direction of the house ) : Where are you all ? ( She appears . ) Why do you always leave me behind ? I 'm afraid in there alone . What are you all doing out here ? ( Afraid , as no one speaks . ) Stephen and Nina slip back from the light . Karl , speak to me ! ( With a harsh giggle . ) I 'm your mother . ( Leans her head against him . ) What a hard place for a weary head ! ( Reaches up and takes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's  --  p. 89 KARL ( taking it ) : Oh  --  ( Looking at it stupidly . ) LUELLA Oh , do come in the house . It 's gloomy out here . ( Takes Karl 's arm to lead him away . ) After holding it uncertainly , he holds the little man out to Eleanor . KARL ( tonelessly ) : You want this , Eleanor ? Curtain . @x ACT III Scene : Same as Act I. Afternoon of next day . Luella has spread out a game of Canfield . She is inappropriately dressed in silk ; very high heels . After a little while Nina , in a black frock , idles in . She is worried and bored , irritated to the point of tears at the sense of impending trouble . NINA Oh , you 're here ! ( Sits on the sofa , rear ; sprawls limply , turns to gaze out of the window ; chin on hand , looks morosely at her mother . ) LUELLA ( sweetly ) : I 'm not like Stephen  --  I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . NINA I had to learn to play alone . LUELLA ( shrugs ) : I did the best I could for you . NINA Alone . In a little backyard half a block from the Elevated . LUELLA The woman I left you with was refined , and very good to you . NINA The surf brings back how I felt when the Elevated roared by . It 's so dreary . LUELLA Why anybody should have a house here  --  ! p. 91 NINA It 's bad for Stephen . LUELLA You think Eleanor is bad for him ? ( With a hard laugh . ) You 're a fool . NINA Stephen did n't think so in Paris . LUELLA ( smiling , completing a suit ) : Did n't he ? NINA Remember that night of pouring rain when I knocked at your door ? I was nervous , just landed from America . The taximan had frightened me . I thought you would be glad to see me . LUELLA ( sarcastically ) : Poor little Nina ! NINA You and Stephen  --  before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and saw me standing there . Oh , how ugly your face was , and you whispered ( whispers ) , You 're my sister , you hear ! LUELLA ( calmly ) : I 'm not listening to you . ( Plays on . ) NINA Stephen jumped up  --  he was slim then , firelight on his face , and he stared at me as if  --  Remember ? Luella plays on without reply . ( Imitating Luella ) : " Here is my little sister Nina , come all the way from New York to visit us ! " p. 92 LUELLA ( coldly ) : You ought to be whipped . NINA He said I was a Saxon princess . That was the next day . I said : " Mother was surprised . I mean sister Luella was surprised . " LUELLA ( hissing it ) : Selfish child ! NINA All that summer you told clever little stories about how we had played together when we were young . LUELLA ( piling the cards together quickly ) : You snake ! NINA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cards at me ! Luella hesitates , strives to shuffle the cards as for another game , puts them down , finds lacy handkerchief , puts this to her eyes . I 'm sorry ! ( Striking her knees with clenched fists . ) No , I 'm not sorry . If I 'm cruel and selfish it 's because you are . LUELLA It was your father . NINA Poor Dad . LUELLA He thought only of himself . NINA Are you leaving to-day ? p. 93 LUELLA ( angrily ) : I am going just as soon as I can . NINA You 've been leaving for three days now . LUELLA I have wired for my steamer ticket . NINA ( surprised ) : Oh , then you are going back to Paris ! LUELLA There is no culture in this country . NINA You 've given up the shop ? LUELLA Oh , that was just sort of an idea of mine . NINA Bob McClure must have come through . LUELLA ( ignores this , deals cards for another game ) : What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUELLA You 'd better try to know ! NINA What do you mean ? LUELLA Serial comic art at its best is one of the purest expressions of the American spirit . NINA For Heaven 's sake ! LUELLA Millions of people look at Karl 's pictures every day . p. 94 NINA Yes . Yes . Karl is wonderful . And I 'm a fool . LUELLA His income now  --  NINA So you inquired into his income ? LUELLA As your mother , it seemed my duty . NINA And then , as in a flash , you saw that " serial comic art  --  " LUELLA Who wants paintings ? What can you do with them in this age ? The art of the people  --  NINA Yes , dear , I 've heard it all from Stephen himself . . . . LUELLA You ca n't earn your living . You 're married to a fine , true man , who loves you . Scoffing murmur from Nina . A man with an excellent income . I speak for your own good . After all , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NINA You introduced me to the family ? LUELLA I did . NINA You are marvellous , Mother . LUELLA It 's a comfort to know you are fittingly provided for , that , after all , we are not poor . NINA ( softly ) : We ! p. 95 LUELLA Do n't make the mistakes I made . Hold on to him . NINA ( softly ironical ) : Be a good wife to him . LUELLA I must say you 're not worthy of his love . NINA ( turning on her ) : Oh , " worthy ! " You 're not loved for being worthy . LUELLA Deep in your heart you love Karl . NINA ( sadly ) : Deep in my heart  --  I do n't . LUELLA He is so good to you . NINA ( tragically ) : He is so good to me . LUELLA Where is this new thing between you and Stephen going to end ? NINA I do n't know . Eleanor enters , right , bearing something on a tray . ( Sniffing ) : Chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds out her hand , half playfully , but wanting it . ) ELEANOR ( quietly ) : The broth is for Karl . He 's been working in a cold room all afternoon . p. 96 NINA Karl likes to work . Without further comment Eleanor crosses the room and goes out , right . ( Low ) : The broth is for Karl . LUELLA And Eleanor 's tone said  --  NINA ( sharply ) : What do I care what the tone said ! I do n't have to wait on men ! LUELLA ( deploringly ) : Oh , Nina ! Nina ! NINA ( passionately ) : Let me alone ! LUELLA ( returning to her solitaire ) : Very well . NINA I ca n't think . I only know I love Stephen again as I loved him those heavenly months in Paris . LUELLA I remember you wept often enough . NINA ( sullenly ) : That was part of it . LUELLA But , Nina , what are you going to do now ? NINA Love each other . Go to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . p. 97 NINA He would take care of me . LUELLA Stephen does n't take care of anybody , Nina . He 's too helpless . Oh , yes , he is superior to games . He wants to live every minute , to paint his pictures and get out into the open doing natural things  --  that 's enough for him . ( Dramatically . ) Do you know why ? NINA ( turns with sudden interest to her mother ) : Why ? LUELLA Because Eleanor entirely surrounds him , because she takes care of him  --  sees that he is fed and clothed and washed , that he is n't afraid at night . NINA What nonsense ! LUELLA If she did n't make a safe place for him to be brave in , he 'd play anything to shut out his loneliness and his uncertainty . NINA ( sullenly ) : I could take care of him . LUELLA ( ignoring this ) : I understand men . NINA But you lost all yours . LUELLA They were all selfish . NINA Oh , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may laugh ; I thought they were in love with Luella  --  with my  --  my looks . They were in love with some creature so perfect I could n't be conceited enough to pretend to be her . Must you go on making the mistakes I made ? NINA I love Stephen . LUELLA When he had tired of your wonderful hair , where would he go for rest and comfort ? Nina , watching her mother intently , does not reply . And when you were alone with your tears again , who would you first think of ? Me ? NINA ( shakes her head slowly ) : No . LUELLA You 'd go hunting Karl  --  all over the world , if you had to . NINA ( with impotent anger ) : I want to be free ! LUELLA You 'll never be free ! NINA ( doggedly ) : Stephen could make me free of  --  of myself ! LUELLA Nina , why do n't you love Karl ? NINA ( pause ) : Eleanor makes Stephen helpless by babying him . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants is an ambitious woman to get him out of the rut . . . ( Begun confidently , her voice drops , and the following words are said without feeling ) get him into the battle in New York , encourage him , urge him higher . p. 99 LUELLA ( after a thoughtful silence changes the subject as if to avoid knowing something ) : Bob McClure does everything for that thin little French girl , who has no more looks than a weazel . But she knows what he wants . Men are selfish , and it 's a woman 's job to get what she wants from them by finding out what they want and keeping it from them . NINA ( listlessly ) : I 'm so unhappy ! LUELLA ( laying down cards , clasping hands , with great earnestness ) : Leave here to-day , Nina  --  before it is too late . NINA ( softly ) : Will you go with us ? LUELLA ( brightly ) : Why , yes . NINA ( harshly ) : So that 's why you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car ! LUELLA How selfish you are ! From outside comes Stephen 's song : New cherry wine , who will have a swallow ? Grown on the little tree , Down in Higgins ' Hollow ! All the year till next October We but seldom need be sober ! The outer door swings wide . Enter Stephen , holding high an earthen goblet . p. 100 STEPHEN I bring you new wine ! ( To Nina , who has gone to him . ) Ready for bottling . Taste it . She holds it in her two hands , slowly , voluptuously sips , her eyes on Stephen . NINA It is wine from heaven . Eleanor , who had not closed the door tightly behind her , pushes it open , is in the doorway , for the moment unobserved . Nina is holding the goblet in her two hands . She and Stephen are close together . STEPHEN ( excited , both by Nina and by pleasure in the wine ) : It is the wine of life . It is from a little cherry tree that waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He takes the goblet from Nina . Oh , Eleanor , I bring you the new wine ! ELEANOR Thank you , Stephen . Not just now . Surprised , he stands holding it out to her . NINA ( taking it from him , like a greedy child ) : Then give it back to me , Stevie . Again drinks , but he is still looking at Eleanor . Nina puts the goblet on the small table . p. 101 LUELLA ( as one being tactful ) : Karl getting along all right , Eleanor ? ELEANOR He 's working hard . NINA Time for us to work , too , is n't it , Steve , if I 'm posing for you again this afternoon . STEPHEN Yes  --  that 's right  --  ( But without pleasure in the idea . ) He turns abruptly and goes out , Nina following . NINA ( her voice coming in from outside ) : You 've got an awfully good start with it , have n't you , Steve ? I thought the composition  --  ( Words lost , Nina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sits beside the small table , on which Nina has placed the wine . LUELLA ( after an apprehensive look at Eleanor ) : I 've been telling Nina not to act like a fool . Slowy Eleanor turns to her . She 's still awfully young , you know ; really not more than a child , and men spoil her  --  on account of her looks . When she 's gone through as much as I have she 'll know which side her bread is buttered on . ( Gather up cards . ) But by the time you 've learned which side it 's buttered on , you have n't got the bread . ( Begins to spread out a new game . ) Anyway , I had a letter from my lawyer this morning . McClure finally came across with back alimony  --  not before he had to . I 'll bet it made that French girl squeal , a franc going to another woman . ( As Eleanor remains silent . In the voice of one who would welcome excitement . ) Is anything the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration ) : Why not just leave things to me ? Eleanor looks at her . I 'm getting in my work . ELEANOR ( less calmly ) : Oh  --  please . ( More to herself than Luella . ) We must n't meddle . LUELLA Meddle ? ( With dignity . ) When my own daughter 's happiness is at stake ? And aside from Nina  --  there 's Karl . ELEANOR Yes . LUELLA I love Karl as if he were my own son . There 's nothing I would n't do  --  for Karl 's sake . At those last words Eleanor again lifts her eyes and is looking at Luella when Stephen comes swiftly in . His brushes are in his hand ; the manner of one who comes for a particular thing . STEPHEN Eleanor , what did you mean by  --  Please , Luella , I want to speak to Eleanor . LUELLA Well  --  really ! ( Pushing back her chair . ) Why , certainly . ( Looks to Eleanor as if for protest , but as neither of them speaks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Awfully sorry to have been in the way . ( Tremulously . ) There never seems any place for me . ( Walking to the outer door . ) I 'm leaving first thing in the morning . p. 103 STEPHEN ( with concentration ) : Eleanor , what did you mean by refusing my wine ? ( He has sat down across the table from her , the goblet of wine is between them . ) ELEANOR I did n't feel like it . STEPHEN ( incredulous , with growing excitement ) : You did n't feel like it ? Our wine ! The wine from " Little Tree , little tree , I love you ! " ( He puts his hands upon the goblet . ) You wo n't drink it with me ? ELEANOR Nina was drinking it with you . STEPHEN What has that got to do with it ? I brought it to you ! And you refused to taste of our wine  --  and I ca n't do another thing until I know why . I could n't paint . I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resentfully . ) And you know it 's like that ! ELEANOR I had just come from Karl . STEPHEN Well ? ELEANOR Is n't there any answer there ? STEPHEN No ! There is not an answer . ELEANOR He 's up there drawing pictures to make people laugh . p. 104 STEPHEN Well , that 's his work . ELEANOR He was so surprised that I should think to bring him something . STEPHEN ( coldly ) : It was nice of you . I do n't know what it has to do with this . ELEANOR Then you 're being wilfully stupid . STEPHEN ( heatedly ) : It 's you are being stupid . And worse than stupid . I have to have this feeling of  --  of communion between you and me . In that I live , and you know it damn well ! ELEANOR ( a slight laugh ) : You must have the feeling of communion with me in order to make love to another woman ? STEPHEN Laugh about it ! Yes , it 's true ! Now ! Gloat over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You know I am not gloating over it , Steve . STEPHEN ( putting her hand around the goblet ; with intensity ) : Then drink with me , Eleanor . She starts to raise it , puts it down , closes her eyes as if shutting something out , pushes the goblet from her . p. 105 ELEANOR Not until there 's truth between us ! Look at this thing you 're doing . Look at it ! STEPHEN All right . I 'll look at it . When have I refused to look at things ? ( A pause . ) I do n't like what I see  --  if that 's what you want me to admit . My brother 's wife  --  that 's not  --  ELEANOR Your young brother  --  who is carrying a great burden , and who loves and trusts you . STEPHEN ( in cold anger ) : I know that . Oh , how dare you so calmly assume that all insight , all sympathy are yours ? I could almost hate you for it ! ELEANOR ( deeply hurt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . STEPHEN You do n't think I like this ugly mess , do you ? ELEANOR But what is it you want ? STEPHEN What have I done ? Yes , I kissed Nina . . . ! ELEANOR What is it you want , Stephen ? STEPHEN ( sullenly ) : I want you . ( Pause . ) I want us , down deep , indestructibly together . I need you now as in the beginning . p. 106 ELEANOR ( gently , as his head droops ) : Are you in love with Nina ? STEPHEN We were lovers once . Last night the old passion ( shaken in the memory of it )  --  it came so suddenly , so strong , I did not know what I was doing ! ( Pause . ) We 've been here in isolation too long . It makes one forget one is young . ELEANOR I thought you loved it so . STEPHEN Oh , I did , Eleanor . I do love it . ELEANOR But Karl , your fear for Karl ? STEPHEN ( seizing upon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that back of it all was my fear for Karl ? Have you lost sight of that ? ELEANOR Oh , Stephen , have n't you lost sight of it ? STEPHEN ( and as if hurt himself ) : She hurts him so . She is n't the wife for him . He should be made to see . ELEANOR Last night , when the light took you into its circle  --  STEPHEN ( laughing , welcoming a grievance ) : " Took me into its circle "  --  that 's good ! Of course not  --  " Last night , when I turned the light on you ! " p. 107 ELEANOR Karl was coming . I did it for Karl . STEPHEN ( with desperate exasperation ) : Oh , Karl  --  Karl  --  we do everything for Karl ! ELEANOR If you were doing this for Karl to see , why were you so displeased to have him see ? ( A tense silence . ) Now Karl has seen . Is there any less love in the eyes that have seen ? STEPHEN ( sullenly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . ELEANOR Stepped in ? STEPHEN We had quarrelled . We were always quarrelling . Hatred and anger  --  that 's part of her love-making . She would leave me " for ever "  --  and we 'd be lovers next day . ( In deep revolt . ) Oh , how disgusting ! ELEANOR Then even yet  --  I do n't know the truth of it . STEPHEN The truth ? ELEANOR You told me you left Nina for me . STEPHEN That is the truth of it . ELEANOR But after Karl had stepped in . After Karl had taken her away from you . p. 108 STEPHEN Karl did not take her away from me ! To hurt me Nina flirted with Karl . It did n't work . And why did n't it ? Because I met you . ELEANOR You  --  retaliated . STEPHEN You know better than that . I loved you . You were life as I wanted life . Then how could she reach me ? ELEANOR Through your brother , perhaps . STEPHEN What ? ( In incoherent distress . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure  --  what I 'm seeing . STEPHEN Do n't hurt me , Eleanor . Help me . I need you now as  --  do you remember , dear ?  --  the night I went to your aunt 's house to see her pictures  --  and you showed me the Ryder , and we talked of that strange , lonely man  --  of the life there has been in America  --  of change  --  time  --  something that abides ? Do you remember ? ELEANOR I remember just where we stood . STEPHEN I went out of that house  --  free ! I believe in salvation , for it came to me . It was like coming from a thicket to wide sweet uplands . I wanted to forget that family  --  that tangled beauty . It must not invade the world I entered with you . You believe me , do n't you , Eleanor ? p. 109 ELEANOR Yes , Stephen , I believe you . ( Her hands , twined together , lay on the table before her . ) STEPHEN We have n't had our walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELEANOR ( her hands move forward , they are around the stem of the goblet . Speaks timidly ) : Maybe our world is  --  worth fighting for ? ( Looking straight across at him . ) Do you love me , Stephen ? STEPHEN I do love you . ELEANOR Then will you do something for me ? He continues to meet her eyes . Will you end this ? Tell Nina that you love me , love Karl , that you despise her while you are drawn to her , that it can never come to anything but an ugly mess . He is silent , pulled two ways . I do n't believe I 'd ask it for myself . That thing in me that wo n't  --  step in , you 've called it selfish , but its fiber of my fiber , bone of my bone ! It keeps me from saying to her  --  I want you to leave my house ! STEPHEN ( quickly ) : Oh , you ca n't do that ! ELEANOR It 's what a woman would do now  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you see  --  you drive Nina away , you drive Karl too ! ELEANOR Yes , I see that . But they would be gone , and our house would again be our house . Only , would it ? Oh , Stephen , keep me from doing that ! Protect me  --  as a man should protect his wife ! STEPHEN ( moved ) : Eleanor ! ELEANOR I think and think about it . I say , you can step from this you cherish . You would n't do it for yourself . You can do it for Karl . She would turn to him  --  needing his security . I say to myself , this you that would not violate , that makes you what you are and one with all , it you can give as a great gift ! Dear , I do n't want to . Why is it I have almost known  --  and from whence comes my security and my happiness ? Meddle-trap , then you are of the meddling , trapping world , and never again are you taken into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps just because her hands were on it , she is pushing the goblet toward him . ) Will you do this for me , Stephen ? Yes , how absurd I am . ( Laughing a little , but with tears . ) For in asking you to do it I am meddling . But that 's between you and me . One of the great intimacies . Will you take unto yourself this sin  --  and leave me  --  free ? Or somewhat free  --  free enough to say again  --  " Little tree  --  little tree  --  I love you , little tree . " Will you do this for me , as in the Catholic church they do things for one another , and then all the rest of my life  --  I 'll say prayers for you . It trembles there between them , when Nina appears . p. 111 NINA Was I  --  ( Seeing the intimacy of the moment and more angry , but trying to control it . ) Oh  --  pardon me . I am intruding . Was I wrong in thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with difficulty ) : No , Nina  --  sorry to have kept you waiting . NINA You know I hate to be kept waiting . ( Blazing . ) What do you mean , leaving me there  --  posing  --  to nothing ! STEPHEN ( rising ) : I had n't meant to be so long . NINA Rushing off without saying a word ! STEPHEN I wanted to ask Eleanor something . Then we got to talking . NINA Got to talking  --  leaving me out there posing in an empty barn ! STEPHEN ( a short laugh ) : Awful waste . ( With a look at her beauty in anger . ) Wish you were posing for me now . NINA Are you making fun of me ? STEPHEN ( taking his brushes ) : Nope . There 's still a little light left . ( Starts out . ) Come on , Nina . Do n't make a silly fuss . Nina is uncertain , wants to refuse , but wants to go ; turns to follow . p. 112 ELEANOR ( who has not moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't go with Stephen . Stay with me . Nina , surprised , apprehensive , stands hesitant . Stephen has turned in the doorway . I want to talk with Nina , Steve . STEPHEN There 's only a little light left . ELEANOR ( quiet , but compelling ) : I want to talk with Nina . Stephen looks from one to the other , reluctant , but goes . Nina stands uncertainly . Wo n't you sit with me a little while , Nina ? You and I have never talked with each other . Nina looks at the chair where Stephen sat , takes one farther away . NINA ( sullenly ) : Well , I suppose you want to tell me what you think of me ! ELEANOR I asked Stephen to do something for me . It was cowardly . I must do it myself . ( Pause . ) Karl loves you , Nina . NINA ( defensively sarcastic ) : Is that the big news ? ELEANOR ( simply ) : Yes . In this moment I can talk to you . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what is it you have to tell me  --  in this moment ? ELEANOR That Karl loves you . That this is the greatest gift there is for us in life . NINA Is it , indeed ? ( Trying to be sarcastic , defiant , but not succeeding before this stark sincerity . ) ELEANOR I know , because Stephen loves me . NINA Oh ! Stephen loves you ! ELEANOR Yes . NINA And I am to step back to Karl 's love , and leave Stephen to you ? ELEANOR Yes . NINA Yes ! Why not ? What a good idea ! But what are we to do about the fact that Stephen loves me ? ELEANOR Stephen does not love you , Nina . Stephen loves me . NINA You talk as if you knew all about it , and I knew nothing about it ! Maybe the joke 's on you ! ELEANOR I thought we could talk . It will be dreadful if we quarrel . NINA I do n't want to quarrel . People are always making me do things I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her ) : I suppose they are . Yes , being beautiful may make it hard for one . Nina is drawn to this , but suspicious . When I was a little girl I wanted to be beautiful . NINA ( unable to resist it ) : You do n't now ? ELEANOR Yes . Though I do n't think much about it , for myself . NINA It seems to mean something to men . ELEANOR Yes . NINA To an artist especially , I suppose . ELEANOR Perhaps , though a real artist likes discovering beauty . NINA ( becoming excited again ) : Oh , I would n't say they object to having it put before them . ELEANOR Karl has beauty . NINA ( in a tone ironically coaxing ) : Oh , please ! We 're not going to talk over Karl 's beauties and virtues , are we ? I 've heard them all . ELEANOR And you do n't feel them ? NINA That 's a rather personal question . Oh , I suppose you think you have a right , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think I have a right . That 's why I do it so badly . Nina is silent , baffled . I want to  --  give Karl something . Nobody else could give it for me . It  --  ( Slowly . ) It 's the most I have to give . NINA Oh , Karl ! Karl ! I suppose it 's all for Karl ! ELEANOR ( considering ) : I do n't know . ( Pause . ) But , Nina , you would n't  --  destroy Karl  --  would you ? ( Alarmed , as Nina does not speak . ) And for what ? NINA For love , maybe . Oh , do n't worry . People are n't so easily destroyed . He 'd have Mugs . ELEANOR You would leave Karl ? ( Drily , after the pause . ) I 'm afraid you would often find yourself posing in an empty barn . NINA You 're very sure of yourself  --  but he loved me before he loved you ! ELEANOR And left you for me . NINA He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karl ! Now we 're in love with each other again . There it is  --  if it 's the truth you want . p. 116 ELEANOR Stephen does not love you , Nina . NINA ( springing up ) : Why do you keep saying that ? How dare you ? I 'm young  --  beautiful  --  he 's mad about me ! ELEANOR You 're young  --  beautiful  --  perhaps he is mad about you . But Stephen does not love you , Nina . NINA I 'll show you whether he loves me or not ! I 'll show you what I can do ! ELEANOR ( rising ) : First , I 'll show you . ( Big with an unsparing , impersonal calm . ) Stephen feels you 'll ruin his brother . He 's doing this for Karl to see what you are . It 's a plan of his . He talked it over with me . NINA ( at first speechless  --  slowly ) : That is not true . ( Like a scream . ) It 's a lie ! ELEANOR It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie  --  you  --  ( Coming nearer , almost hissing it . ) You jealous old woman ! Eleanor moves swiftly through the door , cups her hands , calls loudly . p. 117 ELEANOR Stephen ! Oh  --  Stephen ! Within , Nina , astounded , can not move . Eleanor comes back into the room , Stephen following . NINA It 's a lie , is n't it , Stephen ? Tell her it 's a lie ! STEPHEN Why  --  ( Turning , bewildered , to Eleanor . ) What  --  ELEANOR She talks of leaving Karl for you . I told her you did n't love her . I told her you are pretending  --  so Karl can see what she is ! NINA And I told her she 's rotten with jealousy . Tell her that , Stephen . Tell her she 's old and I 'm young  --  that I 'm beautiful , and you want me ! Tell her the truth ! ELEANOR Yes . Tell me the truth . Is it or is it not true that you told me in the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were doing this for Karl ? Both women wait for his word . Between us there has always been truth . Let there be truth now  --  or never again will we drink from the tree that made us ask what is life . STEPHEN Eleanor ! NINA ( frantic now , afraid of the truth ) : If you did tell her that , it was to put her off the track ! Tell her that , Stephen . Tell her that ! p. 118 ELEANOR Is that the truth ? STEPHEN ( throwing out his hands ) : Oh , God ! How do I know what 's the truth ? NINA ( as it dawns ) : What ? What ? It 's  --  you were  --  you dared  --  STEPHEN ( to Eleanor ) : You force this much , then tell the whole truth ! Tell what you all along suspected  --  fooling myself  --  forgetting about  --  NINA ( who can listen for nothing more ) : When you were kissing me  --  when you held me and said you loved me  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! I was not making game of you ! NINA Is it or is it not true that you love me ? STEPHEN God ! How women claw at a man ! ( As a snarl . ) Leave me alone , both of you ! NINA And you  --  you called me that name ! Give me a name to call you ! ( Beats her fists against him . ) Give me the worst name that was ever said ! p. 119 STEPHEN ( catching her arms  --  low ) : You are beautiful ! NINA ( wrenching away , pointing at Eleanor ) : She 's not beautiful . But you love her . What has she got that I 've not got ? I 'll show you what I 'll do with the beauty you do n't love ! ( Crying . ) I 'll throw it into the surf ! I 'll show you whether you can  --  I 'll kill myself ! I 'll show you  --  I 'll  --  ( Sobbing , she rushes outdoors . ) ELEANOR ( frightened ) : Nina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll not go far . ELEANOR She was crying so . ( Looking out . ) And in this fog . ( Turning to him . ) What shall we do , Stephen ? STEPHEN We 've done enough . ( Gazing at her in almost impersonal wonder . ) You , Eleanor  --  you  --  who could n't " do " anything ! ELEANOR I did it for Karl ! ( As she hears the words , something is wrong with them . ) And I did it for myself . ( Shrinking from what grows on her . ) I did it for myself . ( To Stephen , beseechingly . ) But I thought I was doing it for Karl . p. 120 STEPHEN ( walking about ) : Where do you suppose she went ? ELEANOR She was crying so . STEPHEN I 'll go find her . As he starts for the door he is stopped by Luella 's voice outside . LUELLA Karl ! Karl ! ( She rushes in , crying . ) STEPHEN Luella ! ELEANOR ( frightened ) : What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEPHEN He is n't here . LUELLA ( crying ) : Nina 's gone down the beach road . I tried to stop her . She said the surf was calling her . Karl ! Karl ! ELEANOR ( sharply ) : Oh , Luella , control yourself . Karl enters , carrying a big square of bristol board  --  his Sunday pictures . He is dishevelled , exhausted , wears a green eye-shade . He puts the cardboard down on the sofa , back , centre , takes off the eye-shade. p. 121 KARL What 's the matter ? LUELLA ( flinging herself upon him ) : Nina 's out there in the fog ! KARL What ? LUELLA She went running down the beach road . I tried to hold her back . She pulled away from me . She said ( a new burst of sobbing ) the surf was calling her ! KARL ( wrenching free , over her head to the others ) : Where 's Nina ? STEPHEN She went out a moment ago . Karl  --  one look at them all  --  Luella covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his head hanging . Eleanor near the door , erect , staring at Karl . Her look tells him enough . He strides to the door , loudly calls , Nina ! Runs out , calling , voice growing farther away , Nina  --  Nina  --  Nina ! ELEANOR Oh , Stephen , had n't you better go with him ? LUELLA ( with surprising calm ) : No , Stephen . Now is Karl 's time . STEPHEN ( after a moment ; shivering ) : It 's cold in here . p. 122 LUELLA ( wiping her eyes ) : Well , let 's not have the horrors about it . ( Lights the lamp . ) She was putting it on . I 've seen my mother do the same thing . ELEANOR She was  --  so wild . LUELLA ( easily ) : Oh , yes . ( She sits on the sofa beside the square of bristol board . Picks it up . ) It 's Mugs . ( Looks from one panel to another , with a sudden short laugh at the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'll cry and cry , and he 'll comfort her . But I was frightened . ELEANOR I am frightened . LUELLA I wanted to get them together , so I sort of  --  put it on , for Karl 's sake . ELEANOR ( stung ) : Oh ! LUELLA Do sit down , Eleanor . They 're out walking on the beach with their arms around each other . Could n't we play dummy bridge ? STEPHEN ( leaping to his feet ) : I 'm going out after them . ELEANOR Sh-h ! What was that ? p. 123 LUELLA ( in an instant on the verge of hysteria ) : Somebody in the house ! STEPHEN ( to Eleanor ) : Is it Mary ? ELEANOR ( listening ) : She 's in town . Slow , deliberate footsteps beyond the door at left . They come nearer as all wait , staring at that door . The door opens slowly . Out of a black hallway , Nina , tall , pale , enters . She has changed from the black of the earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her head high , remembering her threat to kill herself . She is half-way toward the outer door . ELEANOR Where is Karl ? Nina turns in anger at this question . STEPHEN Did you leave him alone on the beach ? NINA ( sullenly ) : I have n't been on the beach . I 'm looking for Karl . STEPHEN Well , I 'll go bring him in . ( Goes into an adjoining room , left . ) ELEANOR Did n't you hear Karl calling ? NINA ( sullenly ) : Yes , I heard him . p. 124 STEPHEN ( from the other room ) : Where 's my coat ? Eleanor turns , but does not go in there or speak . LUELLA ( to Nina , in a loud whisper ) : You 've put too much powder on ! STEPHEN Oh , here it is . ( Comes hurriedly in , getting into his coat . Faintly but clearly heard a man 's voice : Mr. Rolf ! ) LUELLA Oh , my God ! STEPHEN ( slowly ) : Who was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Rolf ! All have turned to the door . Stephen steps toward it . A face suddenly appears at the window , peers in , is gone . Luella , breaking , clawing her cheeks , screems . ELEANOR Stop that noise ! Stephen has flung open the door . STEPHEN What 's wrong ? From the low murmur comes Stephen 's wild , " What ? What are you saying ? " The other man 's voice is low , there come the words , " What we could . " p. 125 STEPHEN Where is he ? What are they  --  ? MAN 'S VOICE They 're coming now . Eleanor slowly moves to the door . ELEANOR ( peering , in voice as from a trance ) : A lantern  --  moving slowly in the fog . Outside , more voices . The words , " Look out there , careful of his arm ! " Eleanor , as in a trance , moves back from the door to permit two coastguards in blue reefers , bare-headed , and Stephen to carry in Karl , slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . NINA Oh , blood on his face . LUELLA ( in a hoarse whisper ) : Is he badly hurt ? FIRST LIFEGUARD ( a big , bearded man , as they arrange the body on the couch ) : He came running down the beach calling Nina , Nina ! And when he met us he said , " Have you seen her ? " We said we had n't seen nobody , and he ran on , down toward the surf . It 's breaking ten feet high , Mr. Rolf , and when he got close I ran after to warn him . He was pointing at a drifting log  --  bobbing on the breakers . Nina ! he called , Nina ! Afore I could get to him , he was in the water . The young lifeguard has moved back in embarrassment . Standing near the sofa , he sees the big square of bristol board on which the last adventures of Mugs have been drawn . He bends a little closer to examine the pictures . Decides he should n't do this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one swept him up , and ( he gestures with two raised hands , standing there beside the body ) and as she broke , that log  --  like it was a club swung by the surf  --  struck him on the head ! Nina collapses on her knees beside the couch , covering her head with hands and arms as if it is being struck . p. 126 STEPHEN ( standing on the far side of the couch , sobbing ) : My brother ! Forgive me ! My God  --  forgive me ! Eleanor takes a step toward him . Can not pass Karl , who is between . LUELLA ( in a hoarse whisper ) : He is n't dead ? FIRST LIFEGUARD We could n't do nothing for him . NINA ( sobbing ) : Oh , Karl  --  you 've left me alone ! LUELLA ( in sharp panic ) : No  --  his face  --  I ca n't stand it ! Do something ! First Lifeguard , after a slow look at her , a look at Eleanor , who does not move , takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and moves it to the table near the sofa . The light , withdrawn from Karl , falls upon Mugs . The younger lifeguard , who has been surreptitiously looking , can not resist the chance to see clearly . When he reaches the end of Mugs ' adventure he forgets himself and for one instant , his face strong in the light , he smiles broadly . Curtain .
