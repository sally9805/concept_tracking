txt During the first fortnight of March an economic and financial conference of all the countries of Europe , allied and ex-enemy , and including Russia , is to be held at Genoa . The United States will be invited to participate . That is the result of today 's labors of the Supreme Council here during two long meetings occupying the whole morning and the afternoon from 3:30 o'clock to 6:30 . The Genoa conference , Lonelier said this evening , is to be purely economic and financial and will not in any way touch politics or reparations in their narrow sense . It will be an attempt to reconstruct Europe as a whole on the basis of common need , and will not deal with the claims of any one country or another as a result of the war or the treaty terms . Tile resolution adopted by the Supreme Council printed in full in another column lays down the conditions on which the allied powers would recognize the present Soviet Government . It accepts the principle that no nation can dictate the form of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian debts , abstention from propaganda and legal enforcement of the rights of private property and contract are clearly stated as prerequisites for the investment of foreign capital in Russia and of recognition of the Soviet . Russia 's Chance to Conte In . That this resolution , which serves Lenin and Trotzky with a chance to come into the society of nations on equal and even advantageous terms , was unanimously adopted was entirely due , to Lloyd George . The French delegates lay stress on the fact that debts and rights of private property must be recognized , and that tribunals must be established which will enforce the law . But opinion is almost equally divided as to whether Russia will ever accept these conditions . The discussion was begun by Lloyd George in an hour 's speech at this morning 's conference . In a careful statement he reviewed the situation as he has come to see it in the last few months , with the unemployment problem pressing him hard . Several times ' he " took the chance to push home on the French that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that their way of dealing with their problems was not one which would make for a general settlement . In the afternoon the resolution he had tabled was discussed by all the delegates in what is stated to have been the frankest possible way and in entire agreement . Lloyd George while malting his speech remained seated , in order , he said , " to retain the spirit of conference . " He considered , he said , that this was the most important ' series of conferences , since the armistice , for the reason that the Allies had reached a stage at which they would have to take decisions probably of more far-reaching and wider character than any hitherto adopted . Lloyd George Asks for Frankness . He then made a bid for the adoption by his colleagues of a wider point by postulating the follOwing conditions as essential to a successful conference : That they should be absolutely frank with each other , that they . must settle things by agreement among themselves and that they must recognize that the sacrifices of each were equal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For his own country he made a special plea with this statement : " If we , balance our budget it is not because our burdens are not heavy . but because they are heavy . Our taxes are heavier than those imposed on any other country in the world . " This direct challenge to the French is not likely to go unanswered , but the British Premier forestalled the answer by going on to the statement that " Germany must pay to the utmost of her capacity . " It was right that Germany , should pay , he said , but you must not drive things too far or you would get nothing out of your verdict . They must exercise prudence and this was his reason : " If we , advocate restraint and prudence in dealing with Germany , who is our most formidable com petitor , it is purely because it is in.
