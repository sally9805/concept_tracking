To reform the law , to have an outing , to see the great , some 4,000 lawyers last week congregated in October-cool Memphis for the 52nd annual meeting of the American Bar Association . <P> Law enforcement was the subject of the first big speech , by outgoing President Gurney Elwood Newlin of Los Angeles . He took the up-to-date angle : " The resort to lawlessness in enforcing law or seeking to enforce the law is more than casual , in fact , it tends to be habitual . " <P> Important Folk . Dr. Walther Simons , onetime ( 1925 ) Acting President of the German Reich , onetime ( 1922-29 ) President of the German Supreme Court , was introduced as the guest of honor by past-President Silas Hardy Strawn after an organ rendition of " Tannenbaum " and " The Star-Spangled Banner . " Dr. Simons compared the relation of the German and U. S. judiciaries to the executive and legislative branches of their governments . Hoped he : that the German Supreme Court would " reach the place in Germany that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also among the 4,000 present were good-golfing U. S. Attorney General William DeWitt Mitchell , Wilson-praising Newton Diehl Baker , unpolitical Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt , law-enforcing George Woodward Wickersham , Dean William Draper Lewis of the Pennsylvania Law School , Mexican-born Severe Mallet-Pre-vost , Emory Roy Buckner , Charles Seymour Whitman , George Wharton Pepper , etc. etc . <P> Prohibition . The Association 's policy to avoid bitter feelings by hushing discussion of Prohibition repeal was jeopardized by the presence of a determined wet wing , consisting largely of New York lawyers headed by John Giraud Agar . Firm chairmanship was necessary to keep the subject sidetracked . <P> Bitter Feeling . But elimination of the liquor question did not entirely preclude bad feeling . Educational requirements for admission to the Bar received major consideration and brought in conflict two belligerent factions , one headed by Dean Lewis of Pennsylvania , the other by Dean Gleason Leonard Archer of the Suffolk Law School ( Boston night school ) . Dean Lewis advocated reaffirming the Association 's previous recommendation of a two-year college education prior to law study . Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to foster a " college monopoly on legal education by outlawing evening law schools . " Dean Lewis retorted that Dean Archer , in advocating recognition of evening schools , had " commercial interests only . " Dean Lewis 's recommendation was reaffirmed ; law schools operated for profit were condemned . <P> Mergers . Vigorous prosecution of every violation of the anti-trust laws was promised by Attorney General Mitchell . Changes in business conditions resulting in mergers , new methods of marketing , vertical trusts and chain stores have become so thick and fast as to be confusing to those dealing with anti-trust laws . But the Attorney-General believes the principles of present statutes will be intelligently applied by the courts . Prosperity and expansion , he thought , have increased anti-trust transgressions . Important and beneficial is the promised policy of the Department of Justice regarding questions submitted on proposed mergers and business transactions . No longer will the Department 's views be in cautious , guarded terms . Its attitude on proposed mergers will be clearly stated .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
