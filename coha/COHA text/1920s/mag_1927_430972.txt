 | ALL small bodies of water are enchanted . There is an elusive magic in them , subtle but strong , and any one who doubts this magic may easily put the matter to the test . Let him spend an hour or two in some wood or meadow where there is a pool or little lake . The trees or the flowers will hold his attention for a time , but all the while the water calls to him , and soon or late he will yield to the spell . Turning his back on the flowers and trees , he will find a seat near the margin where , as he rests , he can watch the surface of the pool . There was a hollow in the hills where the wood thrushes sang more beautifully than I had ever heard them sing before , and day after day I was there to hear them , to listen , absorbed and fascinated , to the ringing of their golden bells . Best of all was it when , about sunrise one morning , a shower swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the air was clean and crystal-clear , and everywhere in the shadowy places under the great oaks and the tall black-locust trees floated the fragrance of wild flowers , so that I moved through a forest rich with incense as well as with sound . It was as though the songs of the birds had gained something in sweetness and in power from the fragrance of the flowers and the wet , green leaves ; and one could ask for no greater happiness that morning than to stand in the dim shadows under those ancient oaks and hear ten or fifteen wood thrushes celebrate the sun-god 's slow ascent to his high throne . It was a melody as of bells and flutes and unknown instruments all of gold ; a chorus of invisible voices , some near at hand , others far away , lifted not in ecstasy or in passionate love , but in a calm , pure hymn of praise , nobler and higher and purer than any other music of the hills . For a time , while that chorus was at its height , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom of the hollow there was a pool or little lake , and presently , scarcely realizing where I was going or why , I moved down the slope and seated myself at the foot of a tree where I could look out over the water . A kingfisher swept along the winding stream-valley and lit with a noisy rattle on a dead branch about thirty feet in front of me . On the opposite shore a green heron walked stealthily through the shallows , his long neck fully extended , the feathers on his crown standing out like the head-dress of an Indian brave . Except these two , there was little visible life ; but all around me was movement , all around the circle of the little lake there was a ripple of faint , mysterious , infinitely varied sound . On the wooded slope above , the wood thrushes were still singing , but their music , beautiful as it was , no longer filled my mind and drugged my senses . Of greater moment now seemed those small , furtive rustlings in the thickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to interpret their meaning . So for many minutes I waited , watching and listening , and for a long while seeing no living thing except the green heron and the kingfisher ; but all the while my mind was aquiver with an impression of invisible , abundant life hidden in thicket and brake , creeping  | down from the wooded heights to that small , sunlit , placid pool in the hollow of the hills . Gradually , as I sat watching , this life revealed itself . A chipmunk 's whistle shrilled out near at hand and was answered from across the pool . Here and there catbirds and towhees in the low coverts along the margins made their presence known , some of the catbirds whistling snatches of song . Brown thrashers darted from bush to bush close to the water 's edge . The trees around the rim of the lake swarmed suddenly with white-breasted nuthatches , tufted titmice and chickadees . Jays and downy woodpeckers and plaintive-voiced goldfinches , like flecks of brilliant sunlight , came and lingered a little while and passed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on swiftly whirring wings , and one ? a male whose ruby throat seemed actually on fire ? hung motionless in the air in front of me , examining with the most minute care a small dead twig of a young pine . But most interesting of all were the ovenbirds , those odd , aberrant members of the great wood warbler family who are more like little orange-crowned thrushes than like warblers and in whom , no matter how often one sees them , there lingers still a certain quality of mystery and eeriness in keeping with the shadowy , secluded refuges which they love . In the woods above I had heard them singing , but they were wary , and I had seen little of them there . Now , as I watched beside the lake , I saw them come walking out of the dense undergrowths along the edges , like small , shy , dignified woodland sprites or elves , to promenade solemnly in the open before vanishing in the shrubbery again . These were all among the smaller wild folk of the mountain woods ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known . Yet there had been a strange and memorable fascination in those moments when , sitting by the margin of the pool , I heard and felt the life around me , invisible at first and barely audible , stealing slowly and secretly down through the dim thickets and the whispering trees to the little lake at my feet . Man 's world was very far away then . That small , quiet pool , toward which all the unseen life of the woods was moving , had become the focus of the universe . And somehow it seemed not dead and inanimate but alive ? the living heart of that forest , the soul and center of the forest 's life , the mother and lover of all the creeping and crawling and flying things that dwelt in that hollow of the hills . It was calling to them in a still , small voice alluring as a siren 's song , drawing them to it with a mystical enchantment which somehow spread its power through all those woods ; into every secret hole and crevice where a chipmunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind , tiny beings who had their homes under the ' moist dead leaves ; through the cool , dim , sylvan chambers under the green-roofed thickets where the ovenbirds walked like solemn woodland elves ; through the crooked bark-crannies and the high , leafy galleries of the listening trees . From all sides they were coming , the shy people of the forest , coming nearer and ever nearer , drawn down to @#  | that placid pool by an irresistible incantation too faint and fine for human ears , a spell which the still waters wove . The spell ended and the charm was broken when the life of the woods began to show itself , taking the form , for the most part , of common and familiar birds which I had seen often before . The sense of mystery faded then ; I was back once more in the light of common day ; the " visionary gleam " had fled . But for a precious interval the magic of still waters had possessed my spirit , the world of man had vanished beyond the utmost horizons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets in the inscrutable woods than the prim scientist in his laboratory had ever dreamed . IT IS at such a time as this and amid surroundings such as these that the influence of still waters is likely to be most potent . The secrecy and the blessed quietude of green wooded places soothe and invite the spirit ; in the solemn woods the impression of mystery , of presences unseen and only doubtfully heard , grows slowly , like a gradual unfolding . There are other ways , more definite and yet perhaps more subtle , in which this influence sometimes makes itself felt .  | Roaming idly along a lonely beach one morning in late summer , I thought of a certain tidal pool which was occasionally visited by strange and interesting birds ; and the idea came to me that if I could approach this pool unobserved I might find some of these birds there that morning and be able to study them at close range . The pool lay well above the beach in a broad , bare waste of sand , and the only way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under cover of a low sand ridge between the pool and the sea . This I proceeded to do , wondering , meanwhile , whether I were undertaking this slow and laborious journey fruitlessly . When at last I reached the low summit of the sand ridge and , parting the sparse beach grass cautiously , looked down on the pool just beyond , I saw a sight which was ample reward for the pains I had taken . THE pool had changed its shape since last I had visited it . It formed a crescent now , the convex side facing toward me , and it was of that brilliant and luminous blue which one sees in shallow bodies of salt water under certain rare conditions of sunlight ? a blue recalling that of those blue sunsets which are the rarest and the most beautiful of all sunsets and which one never forgets . Here and there along the edges were tufts of short , green marsh ; but for most of their length the margins were bare of any growth , so that the blue water met the gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the edge of a sword . Indeed , the image that leaped to my mind was that of a scimitar ? a great blue scimitar , sharply curved and bluer than the bluest steel , left lying upon the sands by some gigantic Afreet who had passed that way in the night . But the blue pool , for all its loveliness of color , held my attention only for a moment . Around the edges of the pool , so close at hand that I could have tossed a stone into their midst , a company of tall birds of various shapes and sizes stood at rest ; and among them were no less than twenty of the birds which I had hoped to find in that spot ? wood ibises , the largest and shyest and to me the most interesting of all the wading tribes ? great birds as big as turkeys , white save for their black-tipped wings and short black tails , strangely fantastic with their long , heron-like legs and long , curved bills . Yet the ibises were only a part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same flock and all resting together in perfect accord , were twenty snowy egrets , eight great egrets , five Louisiana herons , seven little blue herons , and two green herons ? sixty-two birds in all , of six different kinds , including some of the largest and some of the most beautiful species to be found in North America . I lay motionless , almost afraid to breathe , so close at hand were the birds . My dog had gone walking with me that morning . Far up the beach he had dashed away on some urgent business of his own ; but I knew that soon he would rejoin me , startling the flock into flight . So , realizing that my time was short , I determined to make the most of it ; yet the image which remains in my mind is not a detailed and accurate impression of individual birds . but rather a panorama in which details are lost in the beauty and strangeness of the general effect . A painter could not have arranged the scene more admirably . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood the big wood ibises in a rather compact group close to the water 's edge ; and behind them and on both flanks the egrets and herons stood , some with their feet in the water , most of them a little back from the shore . Thus nearly the whole inner margin of the crescent-shaped pool was lined with birds , and most of the sandy space between the crescent 's wings was filled with them ; and from my ambush behind the sand ridge I gazed at them across a narrow space of luminous blue water which intensified and  | made more brilliant the whiteness of their snowy forms . Those were golden minutes . Just why they were golden 1 can not tell , but the lover of birds and the lover of beauty and the lover of wildness in nature ? the man or woman to whom nature 's wildness is perhaps her profoundest fascination ? will understand . Here were birds and beauty and wildness commingled in a picture never to be forgotten . Here was a great bird-gathering which had burst upon me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacular form ; and the blue pool in the foreground , so intensely blue by contrast with the tall , white birds ranged along its rim ; the level , empty sand-wastes all around glinting and shimmering in the bright sun ; the blue sky overhead where huge , motionless masses of white cumulus cloud towered like snowy mountains ? these , too , were painted fadelessly upon my memory . It was a blue and white picture ? for the white birds far outnumbered the others ? blueness of the sky and the bluer pool ; whiteness of ibis and egret and shining , sunlit cloud . If there were half-tones in it ? shadows and stipplings such as there must be in all natural scenes ? I was scarcely aware of them . What I saw was a brilliant , almost dazzling picture in vivid blue and shining white ; and its beauty of color was perhaps the more impressive because from beginning to end it was almost wholly a picture of still life . The pool was alive with minnows , and I hoped that I might see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shallows and stirring the sand with their feet in order to bring the fish to the surface . But no ibis or egret or heron waded into the pool , and though some of the ibises moved about a little and uttered low , guttural , croaking sounds , most of them stood motionless in various fantastic postures , some with their long , half-naked necks draw 1 in upon their chests , others with necks and bils fully extended . THEIR grotesqueness , the atmosphere of mystery and of wildness which has always invested them in my mind , fascinated me . I could scarcely take my eyes from them ; yet more beautiful by far were the great egrets and snowy egrets whose slender bodies shone with amazing whiteness in the brilliant light . None of these moved . The great egrets. three feet or more in height and appearing even taller because of their slenderness , were scattered here and there among the snowies and smaller herons , and most of them stood superbly erect , their small heads reared to the utmost height to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing thus , like shining images carved from whitest marble , I was aware of a queer , tingling sense of exaltation . They were so tall , so slender , so unbelievably white , so purely and radiantly beautiful in that sunlit place beside the blue pool and under the blue sky , that the sight of them so near at hand stimulated me like wine , and the thought that soon this spectacle must end smote me like a calamity . Yet that calamity , when it came , was no calamity at all , and it came at the right moment ? before the freshness and strangeness of the scene before me had worn away . Suddenly one of the great egrets moved his head quickly , the sunlight flashing on his javelin-like yellow bill . The movement was slight , yet to all the flock it carried warning , and at once that blue and white picture of still life was transformed . It quivered now with vitality , with expectation , with imminent activity . There was an instant of taut , breathless suspense , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army of them heaved upward . To see them rise from the margin of the blue pool ? rise and surge upward and outward " On those far-sweeping , wide , Strong curves of flight " ; to hear the wild music of their great pinions @#  | powerfully smiting the air ? a sound which was like the sound of a rushing wind above a broad , lonely waste of reeds ? these were experiences which I would have walked many miles to enjoy . I had looked forward to this climax even while I dreaded its coming ; but it was finer even than I had foreseen , for the birds did not simply ascend and fly straight away as I had expected . It was my dog that had startled them , and , their attention fixed upon the dog , they did not see me for some minutes , if indeed they saw me at any time . They were afraid of him , but not greatly afraid ; and so , rising not more than thirty or forty feet , they continued to sweep round and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their flight . Viewing them thus sailing and circling directly overhead and at such close range , it seemed to me that the whole air above the sands was alive with them ? that uncounted hundreds of wide-winged , stately birds filled the space between earth and sky . The thought came to me that this was not the world of today , the world which man , the destroyer , has made his own . This was a scene from that far-off , infinitely wilder past when the tribes of the air were at the zenith of their strength ? when the largest and finest species of the feathered race still abounded in untold numbers , and every lake and fen swarmed with thousands of water-fowl , strange and fantastic and beautiful . Minute after minute I lay stretched on the slope of the sand ridge beside the blue pool , while over me the great birds circled and sailed , . cutting each other 's paths , " Swirling and poising idly in golden light . " Ibis and egret and heron swept back and forth above me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its wildness and its stately yet outlandish beauty , I forgot all else and lived for the moment in that world of long ago before man was known . I was in the heart of the ancient kingdom of the birds , unravished as yet by the destroyer 's hand ; and I could , have lain there for hours , I think , without growing weary of the sight . But a few minutes more brought an end . Gradually the circling flock rose higher and broke up into its component parts . Most of the herons and egrets drifted away to the northeast , while the wood ibises , after mounting high , sailed to the northwestward , at first flying in a wedge-shaped squadron , then in single file . Even at that great distance they were a noble sight ? the long , slow-moving line of them , like cranes in a Japanese print , now fanning the air with measured , unhurried wing beats , now sailing onward with motionless , outstretched pinions . Finally they ceased their onward flight and began to ascend still higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the blue sky . It was not strange , perhaps , that for a time I traveled with them in fancy , climbing up and up " to the void of space , The emptiness , the giant curve , the great Wide-stretching arms wherein the gods em-brace And stars are born and suns " THEY had gone , and the wide sands spread empty around me . I sat for a while beside the blue pool , my mind still full of the spectacle which I had witnessed . I had seen far larger flocks than this one . I had seen herons and egrets in hundreds , and the wood ibis , too , I had often seen in great numbers , and sometimes amid surroundings far more picturesque and , one would think , more stimulating to the imagination than the bare , level sand-waste where this flock was seen . Yet in this adventure there was all the freshness of a new experience ; and there was something far greater than that ? a sense of vividness , of marvelous awareness , of sudden realization not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everlasting mystery of earth and sky and all that  | in them is and the immeasurable mystery of life . Now these moments of awareness , of intense perception , are both rare and precious . " Unless the soul goes out to meet what we see , " says Hudson , " we do not see it ; nothing do we see , not a beetle , not a blade of grass . " Truer words have never been spoken . The green world lies about us for the most part invisible , the blue sky over our heads exists not at all ; night after night we walk under the stars , and for us it is as though they were not there . To all of us , during most moments of our lives , 1 Wordsworth 's lament applies with melancholy accuracy : " This sea that bares her bosom to the moon ; The winds that will be howling at all hours , And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers ; For this , for everything , we are out of tune ; It moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is ours . " Yet one feels that in the eyes of nature 's God we can not be wholly to blame . The problems of existence hem us in and command our time and thought . Our eyes are blind to the beauty of sunsets , our ears are deaf to the singing of birds , because our minds , our very souls , are keyed to meet the problems of tomorrow . All this we know to our sorrow , and neither poet nor philosopher has yet discovered an infallible and universal cure . Yet there is something to be found by the margins of still waters which sometimes has power to make those problems fade and presently pass away ; something which may help human minds and hearts to cast off the fetters of circumstance ; something which may even cause dead human souls to awake and , in Hudson 's phrase , go out to meet the things which are to be seen , so that those things become truly visible and real , and we are made suddenly and vividly aware of the miracle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not know . The life of nature is a window through which we may catch glimpses of herimystery and beauty ; and since water is a lure not only for man but also for most of the other forms of life , the watcher beside a pool , if he watches long enough , will see most of the wild creatures of the neighborhood . But the presence of life is not the whole secret of the magic which is in still waters . It is not only the ibises and the egrets which I remember when I think of that August morning beside the blue pool on the sands . The pool itself lives in my memory , not merely as a detail of the picture but as a sort of vital , energizing force , and without it the wonder of that experience would be diminished and its glamour would fade . And that other day beside the little lake in the hollow of the hills ? there , too , something more subtle , more elusive than the life around me , helped to weave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being in the still water lying at my feet . WHAT this thing is perhaps transcends human understanding . It may be the old , familiar enchantment of the quiet , remote , virginal places ; the healing , revivifying power which , in certain moods of the spirit , may be found in the deep woods and on lonely mountain tops and in the solitude of deserts and even in city gardens . Perhaps this magic of still waters , which I have sometimes imagined to be a thing apart and alone and unlike any other force or influence in nature , is in reality only a phase of that larger magic which is immanent in all nature , though only at rare intervals are we conscious of its presence . Yet it is a strange thing to me to look back across the years to those moments when the artificial world of man seemed very far away and the beauty and mystery of earth and of earth 's abounding life possessed me like a dream ; for , looking back thus , I see again and again the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lagoons , the blue or silver sheen of little lonely pools .
