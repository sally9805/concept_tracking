Probably the most funereal note struck in the business world lately was the Central Leather Co. statement . Operations during the calendar year of 1923 showed an unexpectedly heavy defict of $7,272,243 , compared with a surplus of $1,528,209 in 1922 . But in 1920 a deficit of $25,751,666 occurred , followed by another of $11,651,425 in 1921 , so that the Company 's profit and loss deficit Dec. 31 , 1923 , was $12,637,851 . Last year , operations did not even cover expenses , and interest on bonds was paid out of surplus . Common and preferred dividends have been passed since 1920 . The balance sheet reveals conservative management laboring under difficulties . Cash declined from $6,385,240 in 1922 to $4,278,989 last year ; inventories have fallen about $8,000,000 and in the last statement were at $40,040,571 . <P> President George W. Childs ' remarks accompanying the statement , although admirably frank , told little not already known about the industry . Many of the Company 's present difficulties he attributes to the policy , now proved mistaken , of stocking too heavily ; low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry have consequently entailed severe losses . Mr. Childs , however , philosophically pointed out that tanning is a " basic industry " and bound to recover sooner or later . Subsidiary lumber companies did well last year in earnings and business , furnished almost the only bright spot in the 1923 statement .
