Another Big Business errand last week took President Hoover to the great brown-panelled hall of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce across Lafayette Park from the White House . There under the bright flags of Columbus , DeSoto , Cortez and Cabot waited the 400 of U. S. industry-men like James Augustine Farrell ( steel ) , Charles E. Bockus ( coal ) , Matthew Scott Sloan ( power ) , John G. Lonsdale ( banking ) . Frank A. Seiberling ( rubber ) , Roy Wilson Howard ( newspapers ) , Frederick H. Ecker ( insurance ) , Homer Lenoir Ferguson ( shipbuilding ) . To a man they rose and cheered the President as he began to read them his speech : <P> " You have been invited to create a temporary organization . . . to counter act the effect of the recent panic in the stockmarket . . . . The cure for such storms is action . . . . No movement to reduce wages . . . . The greatest tool of stability is construction and maintenance work . The improvements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of these efforts have one end-to assure employment . . . . A great responsibility rests upon the whole people . I have no desire to preach . I may , however , mention one good old word-work . " <P> Again his auditors rose and cheered as the President , smiling broadly , marched out of the hall . The meeting and his speech rounded out his immediate efforts to put momentum into industry , to mold the mass-mind of business . <P> Julius Klein , Hoover-trained Assistant Secretary of Commerce , stirred the meeting to loud applause with the next speech : <P> " The only sound that really counts is the clang of shovels and cash register bells . . . " <P> The nation is now looking to you business men to get out of the huddle of ' conferences ' and play ball . . . . A goodly number of citizens are inclined to be almost disrespectfully skeptical as to the value of committees and resolutions . . . . They are looking for action . . . . Our Christmas trees will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little crepe . . . . " <P> The 400 of Big Business reported hopefully the outlook in their own industrial spheres . A committee of 72 was formed under Julius Barnes , board chairman , of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce , to survey U. S. business , to develop solutions , to make business line-bucks , the economic end-runs , industrial off-tackle plays , suggested by his fellow Julius . Sample problem : Automobile dealers pressed by manufacturers from above with new cars , overstocked from below with used cars . <P> Another problem ( recited by Dr. Klein ) : " The small retailer . . . . Most of them may be careless , shortsighted and therefore shortlived ( commercially speaking ) . . . . Admittedly many of them ought not to be in business . . . . In Louisville the costly perils of careless retailing were shown in the fact that 30 grocery stores failed in that city each month and 32 new ones opened up . . . . A recent analysis of the restaurant business in Kansas City showed that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business and almost exactly , the same number of new ones opened up . . . . If the present average turnover period in charge accounts of some 70 days could be shortened to , say , 40 days , the resultant values in saving in interest charges and by general acceleration of business would run into hundreds of millions of dollars .
