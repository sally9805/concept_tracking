To Ernestine Schumann-Heink , a certain recent War means more than a pale echo of a bold blare of excitement , War veterans more than a cluster of sad-eyed poppies sold on the street by a khaki-coated huckster . For Schumann-Heink 's sons were fighters-four with the U S. army , the fifth on a German submarine , an officer , killed-and a decade is not so long a time when one is within five years of the allotted three score and ten . <P> Last week the Disabled American Veterans of the World War announced through National Commander John W. Mahan the creation of a $750,000 fund-to be called the Schumann-Heink Foundation-named for the chunky , grey-haired woman who has mothered them , who will also mother the fund , gather in the first dollars by a benefit concert tour , which will open in Los Angeles May 29 , take her to 15 cities , ending June 30 in Boston .
