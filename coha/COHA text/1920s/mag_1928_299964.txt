Last week 's principal discovery was a onetime Brigadier General of the English Army washing dishes in a Quebec hotel . While he scrubbed , Charles Henry Gough could ponder a seesaw career in which he had at various times been custodian of drumsticks , sabres , human lives , counters of lingerie , saxophones , dishrags . <P> He was born in England in 1884 , joined the colors as drummer boy at the age of 14 , served 21 years in the British and Australian armies .
