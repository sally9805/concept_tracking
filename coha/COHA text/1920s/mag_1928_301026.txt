Behind the Newsprint Export of Canada there existed a theory and a fact . The theory was that the price of newsprint to U. S. publishers was $65 a ton . The fact was that association members were making deals with such major users as Publisher William Randolph Hearst for less than $60 a ton . When the fact became known to the theory , the Newsprint Export went up in smoke . The Hearst contracts went into court . <P> Down , down , down slid the price of newsprint . Mill production was curtailed ; papermakers ' profits were sliced . ( TIME , Aug. 27 ) . Last week , the " biggest " International Paper Co. , with mills in Ontario , Quebec , Newfoundland ( see Foreign News ) , contracted with Publisher Hearst on the basis of $50 a ton . Friendly , possibly merging Abitibi Power &; Paper Co. made a similar deal with the Chicago Daily News . On the Manhattan stock exchange , International Paper common fell 4 points ; Abitibi hit a new low for the year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
