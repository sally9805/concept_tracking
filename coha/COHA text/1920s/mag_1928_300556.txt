In Cleveland , Judge Harrison W. Ewing , a rather lean , idealistic-looking married man , looked upon two applicants for divorce and refused their request . Then he said : " I shall not allow you to impose more children upon yourselves or upon society . ... I impose upon you three years of birth control . " And then he added that he would help them get a divorce after three years , if they then desire it and provided they have no more children . <P> Applicants were Otto Kourim , 28 , and his wife , Helen , 22 , than whom no two persons could benefit more greatly from a discussion of birth control-always accepting the fact that birth control is , in the Eye of State and the Eye of Church , a deadly sin. * Mr. &; Mrs. Kourim have been married five years . In three of those years , they had three children . Mr. Kourim 's salary has been $24 a week . They had many things to quarrel over . Six months ago , they began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neglect . <P> Suppose Mr. &; Mrs. Kourim follow Judge Ewing 's advice ; then they will be breaking the birth control law of Ohio , which states that no person shall sell , exhibit , give information about or use any contraceptive . A Federal law and the various laws of other states are almost as stringent . In New York State , however , there are two birth control clinics which may give advice when essential to a wife 's health or to save life . <P> But in every state hundreds of physicians , many of them reputable , do give birth control information ; and almost every drug store in the land does sell contraceptives . <P> Judge Ewing vigorously defended his action : " The children are the most important principals in the Kourim case . When this couple ran away at their age it was a gay adventure . . . . When the first child was one year old some court should have given them a lesson in birth control . . . . Their trouble is a direct reflection on the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out birth control information , the very thing that would have saved this couple from this situation . " <P> Naturally enough , Judge Ewing 's unconventional behavior on the bench not only created one of the biggest stories of the week but aroused fierce debate . Absurd though it may be to contemplate enforcement of birth control , most observers credited the Cleveland judge with having raised , sharply , an issue of paramount importance . <P> <P> * " By such sin fell empires , states and nations . Religion shudders at the wild orgy of atheism and immorality the situation forebodes . . . <P> ' ' Defectives , moreover , whether physical or mental , have immortal souls , redeemed by the blood of Christ and destined to share with the sound and the whole the vision of God for all eternity . ...
