Much of the reverence long held for Standard Oil companies by the investing public bids fair to depart after the recent spell of omitting dividends . In rapid succession directors of Atlantic Refining and Standard Oil of Kansas have decided to give nothing to stockholders , which goes to show that even Standard Oil companies are human and fallible . <P> Not so many months ago , some of these companies were very much undercapitalized . Atlantic Refining was a conspicuous example . Surplus was out of all proportion to capital on the balance sheet . Also , political liberals in Washington , about that time , began to demand a tax on corporate surpluses . To avoid such an unpleasant occurrence , generous stock dividends became the order of the day . Atlantic Refining , for example , declared a 900% stock dividend . No longer was under-capitalization so common among Standard Oil companies . <P> Unfortunately , conditions in the oil business got steadily worse , owing to overproduction . Nor has this tendency yet been checked . For the week ending Aug. 9 , production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stocks of both crude and gasoline have become unusually great . Not until these stocks can be reduced and higher prices secured will any lavish dividend policies in the oil business be generally witnessed . <P> . . .
