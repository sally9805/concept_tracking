MR . BLETTSWORTHY ON RAMPOLE ISLAND-H . G. Wells-Doubleday , Doran ( $2-50 ) . <P> The Story . Arnold Blettsworthy , newly weaned from Oxford , not only affianced himself to the tobacconist 's yellow-haired daughter , but joined forces with his best friend in a project to enlighten the world through a chain of bright blue bookshops . Cheated by the friend , jilted by the tobacconist 's daughter , Blettsworthy 's disillusion affected him so desperately that his kindly solicitor-guardian prescribed the traditional remedy-a year on the high seas . <P> Instead of proverbial rollicking freedom , rhythmic sea-chanteys , rough cammeraderie of the sea , Blettsworthy , supercargo , found ship 's quarters confining , and ship 's officers hostile . The horizon , interminably empty , offered no distractions from his recent troubles ; the officers , continually quarreling , added to the gloom . The captain , who by all standards of sea-lore should have concealed a heart of gold beneath his rough exterior , revealed , by persistent bullying , his petulant nature . Moreover he consumed his soup with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrath that culminated horribly : the ship was wrecked off the stormy Patagonian coast ; all hands were escaping by boat ; the captain , before clearing , locked his supercargo into the sinking steward-room . <P> For days Blettsworthy watched in solitude his imminent submersion , observed the playful sharks , conjured , at best , rescue by savages . At long last , he was wakened from delirious nightmare by two of these swarthy brutes , and presented to the goggling , gabbling , filthy , cannibalistic , inhabitants of Rampole Island . <P> Established by a shrewd village elder as insane and therefore a sacred oracle , Blettsworthy eagerly assumed the role which preserved him from the dinner-pot . It was an easy part , for everything he said sounded mad enough , concerning as it did another , and therefore impossible world . The elder , interpreting these mad oracular utterances as convenient , found his Sacred Lunatic a useful alternative for the tribal totems , miniature sloths , to whose whispered advices all unpopular policies were attributed . These wriggly , but sacred , little animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evil-smelling Megatheria , who persisted though they did not reproduce . <P> Sacred Lunatic easily acquired a sufficient smattering of Rampolese , quickly learned to relish succulent human meat . The Islanders prided themselves that they were not cannibalistic , but merely appreciative of the " gifts of the goddess " - bodies of criminals . Moral standards were unusually high , for the monotonous fish-diet made every man the more eager to detect a gustable neighbor 's mortal infringement of law . <P> Gourmands saw further possibilities in the impending war with an upland tribe whose three offences were loudly proclaimed as cannibalism , bodily filth , disgusting stupidity in keeping totem bullfrogs as mystic rulers . But before their war was well under weigh-the generals persisted in time-honored-and-outworn methods-Blettsworthy had rescued a beautiful damsel from suicide , loved her , and carried her to his secret cave in ...
