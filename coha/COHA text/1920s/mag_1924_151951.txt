In Washington , Secretary of War Weeks announced that Colonel Jay J. Morrow , Governor of the Panama Canal Zone , had resigned his post in order to engage in private practice as an engineer . In accordance with established policy , President Coolidge appointed as Colonel Morrow 's successor Colonel M. L. Walker , the Canal Engineer of Maintenance . Ever since Major General George W. Goethals , the Canal builder , retired in 1916 as the first Governor of the Canal Zone , it has been the custom to follow each retirement by appointing to the Governorship the Engineer of Maintenance , who is an assistant to the Governor and conversant with Canal affairs . In this manner Brigadier General Chester Harding succeeded General Goethals ; Colonel Morrow succeeded General Harding ; and now Colonel Walker succeeds Colonel Morrow-continuing an unbroken line of experienced administrators .
