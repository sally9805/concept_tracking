Money makes noise . There is money in the screams of locomotive brakes , rumble of subways , shrieks of factory whistles , whirr of machinery , cracks of pile drivers , cries of peddlers . There is " big money " in the clamor of exchanges , in the shouts of bidders , the scurrying of page boys , the ringing of telephones , the rattle of tickers . When money is plentiful , easy , the world 's marts are thunderous with the din of handling it , transmuting it , losing or winning it . But when money is scarce , tight , there is silence . <P> In Wall Street , greatest of all money marts , silence is neither golden nor popular . The greater the tumult , the greater the profits of the traders , the more stocks and bonds are being sold and resold , the more money is being borrowed and relent . Last week , the powers of The Street prepared to ask New York 's Board of Aldermen to still the noises of riveting , pile driving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important sounds of money-changing . <P> Bull . For four years , Wall Street has been noisier than ever before in its history . It has seen a stream of gold pouring in from abroad . Between 1923 and 1928 , the U. S. exported gold worth $500,000,000 , but imported $1,000,000,000 . Each $1 of gold in a bank reserve means a potential $13 of credit . In four years , the U. S. in this way alone added $6,500,000,000 to its credit resources . It could finance a building boom , a Florida boom , vast instalment selling , new highways , new factories . It had enough credit to support a continuous bull market , with stocks soaring week by week . Through the twelve Federal Reserve banks , together with their member banks , it could lend money to brokers at 3 or 4% , swelling the credit available for speculation . Money was easy . Times were good for the traders . <P> Money was never so easy as last September , when the bull market was in full swing . But in Europe the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to ease up still further on credit in the U. S. , with the sound idea that higher interest rates abroad would attract much-needed funds . It ordered the Chicago bank to reduce its rediscount rate from 4 to 3% . Chicago bankers , led by famed Melvin Alvah Traylor , head of the powerful First National Bank , dissented sharply , voiced grave warnings . Unheeding , the Federal Reserve forced its way , helped Europe weather its crisis . <P> Bear . Banker Traylor 's warnings have been remembered in the last few months . Since September , Coolidge prosperity has suffered many a blow . One by one , market operators have noted these ominous signs : <P> 1 ) The stream of gold has turned away from the U. S. In the last year , exports have exceeded imports by $497,963,400 , killing all the gains of the 1924-27 period . In June , exports reached a record for a single month with $99,932.000 . <P> 2 ) Its credit resources already strained by the movement of gold abroad , the Federal Reserve stopped buying government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market , reducing its credit reserves still further . <P> 3 ) In spite of this reduction , borrowings from member banks , largely to finance brokers ' loans , climbed to a new high point since 1921 , reaching almost to $1,200,000,000.
