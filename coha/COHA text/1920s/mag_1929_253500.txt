Opposition to a President may be a friendly thing , productive of large and pleasant rewards . Such a reward last week came to Representative Finis James Garrett of Tennessee , onetime printer , editor , teacher , lawyer , and now leader of the Democracy in the House . President Coolidge appointed him to the U. S. Court of Customs Appeals . Mr. Garrett had reached up for a Senate rung in the Tennessee political ladder last year , missed his grip . <P> For minority leader Mr. Garrett is young , comparatively . Of his 53 years , 24 have been spent in the House , in laborious ascent through his party organization . A tall stooping man with hollow eyes , a face almost cadaverous , a melancholy voice , he is a devoted lover of the past . <P> In leading his party against the G. O. P. , Mr. Garrett exhibited a delicacy of manner , a restraint of language that caused his more bellicose followers to ask if he were " pulling his punches " ( gentling ) . His attack was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never called the President names . Small wonder that the many potent Republicans who recommended his appointment to a $12,500 job found the President responsive . <P> But from the White House to the Senate with Mr. Garrett 's went two other names that caused much less elation . One was Irvine Luther Lenroot , onetime ( 1918-27 ) Wisconsin Senator , to sit also on the Customs Appeals bench ; the other , Henry H. Classic , Maryland Democrat and once a very much abused U. S. Tariff Commissioner , to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia . <P> For two years , since his fall from politics , Mr. Lenroot has been flitting about Washington , Micawber-like . He had captained many a Coolidge Senate fight ; he never lost faith in the ultimate bigheartedness of the White House . For $10,000 he successfully out-lobbied the Walsh Senate resolution for investigating interstate public utilities , transforming it into a toothless inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission . He distinguished himself last month by winning the so-called Mayflower Marathon : when Herbert Hoover , returning from South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was Mr. Lenroot who , first of all comers , rushed in upon him , wrung his hand , wished him well . <P> Mr. Classic 's wife and brothers owned Louisiana cane sugar mills . The sugar duty came before the Tariff Commission . Commissioner Glassie voted against reduction of the sugar rate , tied the Commission , blocked action , helped Calvin Coolidge out of a 1924 campaign hole . In the Senate he was denounced , his pay cut off .
