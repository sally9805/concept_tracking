txt The question of attempting to apply closure in the Senate to obtain a vote on the World Court resolution , and thus clear the way for consideration of the tax reduction bill , still hangs in the balance tonight . But the application of closure is measurably nearer than on Saturday , when the suggestion was first advanced . A substantial majority of Republican Senators have declared for it , according to a poll made today , and an undetermined number of Democratic Senators have indicated that they are inclined to see it invoked . Preparations for applying the closure rule are in the making , augmented by a growing feeling among pro-Court Senators that the anti-Court coritingent is engaging in a filibuster likely not only to sidetrack the World Court measure , but delay the enactment of the tax reduction bill . Such momentum did the closure proposal obtain today that it was openly suggested in the Senate . For a dramiatic moment it appeared to those uninitiated in the Senate 's parliamenIsry pyttetiee that a vote on the World ' I ; lourt resolution was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cries of " Vote ! Vote were heard . While that vote was only remotely possible , the incident pertaining to it was of importance in that it brought from Senator Borah , leader of the Court opposition , a disclaimer of any intention to filibuster and the suggestion by him of Feb. 10 as a date for voting on the World Court measure . Feb. 10 had been suggested last week by Senator Simmons , leading Democratic member of the Finance Committee , as a time at which the tax bill might come to a vote , and Mr. Borah 's observation carried the implication that he would be willing to have the World Court question passed up as soon as the tax bill was out of the way . His offer was passed over , for the closure proposal was then taking definite shape , and the Senate adjourned until tomorrow , leaving undetermined whether closure 's application should be attempted . How serious is the movement for closure was indicated by a poll of Repubbean Senators made today by Senator Fess of Ohio . It showed that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closure rule , with two of seven unpolled understood to be of the same disposition . And to these eighteen the vote of Senator Shipstead of Minnesota , the Farm-Labor Party 's only representative in the Senate , and the antagonists of closure must muster fourteen Democratic votes to give the number necessary to prevent a closure motion from being adopted . On the basis of the Senate 's full membership of ninety-six it will require two-thirds of that number , or sixty-four to invoke closure . To prevent closure will require thirty-three votes . Democrats Fear a Boomerang . The position of the Democratic members of the Senate as a party organization is uncertain . Their leaders take the position that the World Court ' debate should be permitted to run on for a reasonable time in order to make clear whether opponents of the Court are indulging in a filibuster to delay or prevent ' action on the enabling resolution . Some , perhaps many , of the Democrats are hesitant of sanctioning closure in the fear that it may be a boomerang for them . With Southern Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bogey-man of the closure complex . Other Democrats steeped in the traditions of the Senate are opposed to closure on general principles . But , with all that , the apparent inclination of the majority of Democratic Senators is to side with the closure proposal if it is established that the World Court resolution is being delayed by a filibuster .. Their attitude is influenced by the feeling that If the Court measure is not voted on before the tax bill comes up for consideration , the antagonists of th , e measure will prolong the tax bill debate to delay resumption of discussion of the World Court , and that this will produce a revival of criticism of Demo , cratic Senators on the ground that their attitude toward the tax bill was responsible for retarding its enact ' meat . Walsh Scents a Filibuster . A significant development that dovetails with the Democratic position came this afternoon when Senators thought they detected a resOrVto filibustering by the Court 's opponents . Senator Cole Blease of South Carolina took the floor . Senator Walsh of Montana , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shown sympathy with the view that no decision on closure should be reached until it was shown clearly that dilatory tactics were in progress , made this remark after Mr. Blease began to speak : ' " There is the appearance of a fillbuiter ; " and I am ready to sign now . " By that he meant that he was ready to ' sign the motion directing the presiding officer of the Senate to invoke Rule 22  --  the so-called closure rule . While it takes three-fourths of the Senators voting to adopt the motion . only sixteen signatures are necessary to require the presiding officer to put the motion . The dramatic moment mentioned came this afternoon at the end of a long speech on the World Court by Sensor Borah , with a sharp interchange of views at its end between Mr : Borah and Senators Swanson and Lenroot , who advocate American adhesion to the Court protocol . Senator Heflin of Alabama , pro-Court , mentioned the suggestion that closure be applied . " I think , " said Senator Heflin , " that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set for voting . It is perfectly evident how the Senate stands on It and it should be settled before the tax bill is acted upon . I detect ? the foot-tracks of a filibuster . " Borah Declares Against Obstruction . Mr. Heflin then asked Mr. Borah if he would agree to a date for a vote on the World Court resolution . " I am not going to engage in a filibuster . " answered Mr. Borah . " I 've been eighteen years in this body and I have never taken part in a filibuster yet . I 've spoken three times on this matter and at no great length . From the beginning I have insisted on legitimate debate . In answer to the Senator from Alabama , I would suggest Feb. 10 as a date to vote . I want to be sure not to cramp anybody . " " Oh , I would n't agree to that , " responded Mr. Heflin , who went on to say that Mr. Borah was so eloquent that he could almost make people believe that black was white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of bringing in a closure , if necessary . " Mr. Borah smiled broadly . Waving his hand toward the rostrum , he said : " I truss the Senator from Alabama observe 1 the broad smile on the face of the Vice President . " Everybody laughed over this reference to the satisfaction Vice President Dawes was taking in the movement for closure , a policy he had advocated in his inaugural address and in support of which he had toured the country . Senator Lenroot , In charge of the World Court resolution , spoke briefly . " I hope , " he said , " that the debate will be legitimate on this question . I can not say that of all debates on the part of the opposition . " There was a pause . Nobody appeared to be ready to speak . " I move the reading of the statute , " said Senator Lenroot . This meant the statute of the League of Nations setting up the World Court , to which the United States conforms by the resolution before the Senate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic floor leader , and Senator Swanson , the author of the enabling resolution . " The question is ? " began Vice President Dawes . Blease Steps Into Breach . Then he paused and ordered the reading clerk to read the enabling resolution . But before the clerk could begin Senator Blease asked for recognition , got it and began another speech against the World Court . If the statute had been read , it would have been in order for the Vice President to put the question on adopting the World Court resolution . But that could not have happened unless all the antis were caught napping . If a rollcall had been begun before one of them arose to continue the debate , the question of adopting the resolution might have been settled then and there . There is no disposition on the part of the proCourt leaders to take such a. course , as they are willing to give every opportunity for voting on each reservation contained in the resolution and on the many reservations that will be offered by the Court 's opponents . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , from appearances this evening , is likely to develop into a determined effort to apply closure before the week is out .
