Last week , in Manhattan , the most discussed musical arrival was Clemens Krauss of Vienna and Frankfort , one of the Continent 's outstanding maestros , on his way to be guest conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra . For luggage Conductor Krauss carried the latest novelty from Vienna , a specially constructed suitcase of aluminum and steel to hold music . Customs officers , prodding through his possessions , caused him annoyance by discovering some 250 dutiable cigars . Friends soothed him with the assurance that among Philadelphia 's concertgoers is many a person able , alert and eager to send a distinguished new guest conductor some good cigars .
