The redoubtable Governors Ferguson ( see p. 9 ) of Texas have solved the knotty problem of man 's origin . They perceived that while " evolution " has become anathema among good Baptists , the same flower of evil , though by another name , would smell but half as poisonous . So by administrative fiat it was decreed , and last week Manhattan publishers admitted , that biology textbooks , intended for use among God-fearing Texans , should refer to mankind 's " development " and other phases of the ape-to-man theory should be toned down , by deletion or other euphemisms . Thus , 28 pages of a biology text by Truman Moon of Littletown ( N. Y. ) High School were deleted in toto , and to save argument Author Moon was not even consulted about it . Statements like , " Evolution is a slow and gradual process , " and " It must be remembered that the upright position of man is an acquired position , " were simply left out . Upright Texas believers may now trust their children abroad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has it , will understand the diplomatic Fergusons ' little gesture and explain to their children what " development " really means .
