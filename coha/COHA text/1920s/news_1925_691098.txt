txt It is impossible not to sympathize with the French point of view about the war debts as expressed in the French Chamber by M. MARI1V . In the French mind , the fact that France was the battleground of the war , and that her losses in man power were so enormous , outweighs all other considerations . Frenchmen feel that they held back the German hordes while America was preparing to enter the fighting line , and that the money advanced by the United States was spent for munitions of war used in the common defense . That they resent bitterly Die suggestion that they must now pay us for supplies which they used because we were unprepared is clear when some of their spokesmen go so far as to maintain that they are entitled to a rebate for every French life snuffed out during that period . Only savage irony could think of placing the matter on such a ground . At the opposite pole are our own " red-centers . " They get up in Congress to demand the last pound of flesh immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , might well cost us more in prestige and friendship than the scant monetary satisfaction which we might be able to derive . Between the two sets of extremists . French as well as American . the world is getting a picture of the United States as a buzzard . That this is wholly unjust is plain to any one who considers the actual policy which our Government has consistently followed of making full allowances for the needs and abilities of our creditors . But because we have refused to accept the contention that we should shoulder the entire burden of war debts , we are denounced as selfish and utterly unreasonable . The truth lies between the two extremes . In protesting that it is unjust to demand anything from France , the French extremists are as unfair as are those Americans who insist that the last dollar must be paid at once . A candid examination of the debt problem will show that a good part of the money was , as the French contend , spent in the common cause . But the balance was not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken as a whole , and against them be set off material benefits to the Allies under the peace treaties , the United States has received little or nothing in comparison . The matter is by ' no means one-sided . There is nothing to be gained by endeavoring to put a money estimate on sacrifices . Such methods are both sordid and inconclusive . But a thorough examination of the sums advanced to the Allies by the United States with a view to ascertaining honestly what portions were spent for munitions , how much for clothing , how much for relief , how much for construction of railroads or ' purchase of supplies destined to outlast the war , would make it much easier to determine what amount could rightly be called a part of the common cost of the war , and to what extent America 's share of this should be offset by peace treaty advantages to the Allies . Such an examination would disclose the fact that , contrary to the Buropean belief , by no means all of the money advanced by the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , contrary to common belief , almost $1:000e000 , - 000 of the amount advancedto France was loaned her in the years 1919 and IMO . Some of this , of course , was in fulfillment of pre-armistice agreements , and to pay for goods contracted for during the war . But much of this material was not destroyed in the ' war , and undoubtedly a part of 14 ! ?

But it is only right , in considering the forcefulness of her plea , ( that full attention be given to all the elements in the case . Repudiation is out of the question . It would strike a blow at credit which would handicap France for generations . It is essential that the principle of the validity of the debts be recognized . But it is not inconceivable that when the day of reckoning comes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the debt which was clearly spent in the common behalf on terms so generous that it would not be a burden , while the remainder could be funded on the prevailing market rates for long-term foreign Government loans .
