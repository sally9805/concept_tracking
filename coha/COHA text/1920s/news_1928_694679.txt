txt Rogers Hornsby , outstanding and highest salaried player in the National League , was traded last night by Manager John to the Boston Braves for two obscure players " for the best interests of the New York Giants . " The two players the Giants are to receive in exchange for the star , who in 1926 managed the world 's champion St. Louis Cardinals , and who came to the Giants in exchange for Frank Frisch a year ago , are Francis Hogan , a catcher. who only last season made his d  --  but in the National League , and James Welsh , an outfielder . The announcement came in the form of a typewritten statement signed by both , as manager of the Giants , and Charles A. Stoneham , the club 's President , and was distributed at 9:45 o'clock last night by Secretary James J. Tierney to newspaper men in the Giants ' headquarters in Forty-second Street . The statement read : After due deliberation between President Stoneham and Manager and having in mind what we thought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade was consummated today which involves Rogers Hornsby , second baseman of the Giants , whereby the Giants received Francis Hogan. catcher , and James Welsh , outfielder of the Boston Braves . No cash was involved in the transaction . C. A. STONEHAM , President . JOHN J. , Manager . Statement Is Astounding . Had the ceiling of the room fallen down upon the heads of the astounded baseball writers there could have been no greater consternation . Earlier in the day they had been notified that an important announcement was forthcoming in the evening . Some even had expected that it might pertain to the promotion of Hornsby to the managership of the club , as last Summer there has been frequent reports that the star second baseman was slated to succeed as active pilot of the club . As soon as the writers grasped the full import of the terse statement they plied Secretary Tierney with questions . Neither Stoneham nor was present and Tierney declined to divulge their whereabouts . Neither would he make any comment that would tend to shed any light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphatically that pennant race was taken ill , and it was then that Hornsby rose to his greatest heights as a Giant . The post of acting manager was turned over to Hornsby by and it was the Rajah 's skillful handling of the team on the last Western trip that enabled the Giants , counted out of the race in August , to make one of the most spectacular bids for a pennant in the history of the league . Forced to play nearly all of their games on the road in that terrific closing drive , made during a blistering heat wave in the West , the Giants wound up the race only two games behind the pennant winning Pittsburgh Pirates and half a game behind the Cardinals , who just managed to hang on to second place on the final day . Hailed as 's Successor . It was because of this great showing and the fact that it had frequently been reported that was seriously considering stepping down as active leader of the Giants that a general feeling prevailed that Hornsby eventually would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager . So far as is known , there never was any friction between Hornsby and , who , in fact , spoke in highly complimentary terms of Hornsby 's work at the close of the 1927 season . Hornsby is understood to have signed a , , wo-year contract with the Giants last Spring at a salary of $40,000 a season . Under baseball law , the Braves will have to assume that contract next season . Hornsby , who will be thirty-two years old on April 27 and was born in Winters , Texas , came to the Cardinals in 1915 after breaking into the minors the previous year with Dallas in the Texas League . He was tried out at various infield posts , playing third base , shortstop and second base before he finally rose to the heights of a real star at the latter position . He became one of the real greats of the game in 1920 when he led the National League in batting with an average of .370 . Then followed five successive seasons in which he retained his batting leadership in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new major league record in 1924 when he reached a mark of .424 . He fell off to .317 in 1926 , but last season with the Giants he again seemed to have regained his batting eye and turned in a mark of .361 , placing second to Paul Waner . In sharp contrast to this brilliant record , the names of Hogan and Welsh , who will be Giants in place of Hornsby next season , are scarcely known to New York fans . Hogan came to the Braves as a high Achool player and first appeared in tile role of outfielder before being converted into a catcher by Manager Bancroft last Spring . He began the year as a promising slugger , but wound up with an average of .288 . Welsh , who put in his third season with the Braves last year , had the same batting average . Hornsby " Ca n't Believe It . " Special to The Nell ; York ct ; . ST . LOUIS , Jan. 10 . ? Rogers Hornsby , when apprised tonight of the sensational trade which transfers him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange for outfielder Jimmy Welsh and the young catcher , Frank Hogan , seemed as flabbergasted as the ordinary lay fan will be to hear the news . Hornsby said he did not know anything about the deal and had no idea my trade was contemplated , whereby his allegiance with the Giants would be severed . Hornsby , reached by phone at the Forest Park Hotel , could ascribe no reasons for the exchange , but added that it made no difference to him if it were true he was traded by the Giants . " I can not believe , " said Hornsby . " Only today I had tried to get on the long distance telephone in regard to the employment of a trainer for the Giants for the coming season . However , I failed to get hold of . I have not been notified of the trade and know only what you have just told me . " Questions Braves ' Ownership . ST . LOUIS , Jan. 10 ( R ) . ? Rogers Hornsby announced late tonight the receipt of a telegram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , informing him of the deal . Obviously at a loss for words , the ballplayer asked reporters if there was anything to the report that the Braves are owned by the Giants . " Maybe they 're trying to build up a Boston he said . " I 've heard the Giants own the Braves . Do you know whether that 's true ? I certainly do n't know what 's wrong if there is anything wrong . " Of course it 's all right with me . It does n't make any difference to me whether I 'm with the Braves or any other club , but I do not know what the New York officials mean by saying I was traded for the best interests of the club , unless they simply meant to infer they received players who will give the team more strength than I have given it . " Judge Fuchs Elated . Special to The New York Times . BOSTON , Jan. 10 . ? A statement issued tonight by Judge Emil E. Fuchs , President of the Braves , follows : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hornsby , whom we consider the greatest player in the National League , and the New York Giants received two young prospects , Frank Hogan of Somerville and Jimmy Welsh . " As the Braves have an option of an experienced catcher , we were able to part with Hogan , who , we trust , will develop and make good in his new surroundings , as his showing during the early part of last season indicated that he would . Welsh also has shown possibilities of development with his natural qualifications as a batter and fielder . " The personal relationship between Hornsby and the undersigned has been one of warm friendship for years , and I promise the Boston public that he will give us everything he has to bring the Braves toward the top . " While I regret the parting with Hogan and Welsh , of whom I was very fond personally , from the standpoint of Boston I am elated with tile trade , BUIL E. rucm .. " " the statement would have to speak for itself . " Not a baseball man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible reason for what was generally regarded as a dismissal of Hornsby , who by the millions of fans throughout the country has hailed as the great " Rajah . " That some mysterious motive was involved was almost universally conceded for the trade itself , viewed in the light of the respective merits of the players involved , scarcely could be called an equitable one . Hornsby Obtained Year Ago . Hornsby came to the Giants a year ago in a trade that , in itself , was a sensational one . Hornsby , who while a member of the Cardinals had been the champion batsman of the league for six consecutive years , was at the time receiving the plaudits of the baseball world for his achievement in piloting the Cards to the first National League pennant ever won by St. Louis and then leading his team to victory in the world 's series over the New York Yankees . At the close of the 1926 season , however , Hornsby became involved in a dispute with Sam Breadon , owner of the St. Louis team , over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in salary over his previous contract and insisted , according to report , that he receive $50,000 a year as a reward for having won a world 's championship for the club in his first full season as a manager . While argument between owner and manager was at its height , announcement came that Hornsby had been traded to the New York Giants for Frankie Frisch , a star second baseman considered by some of equal merit to the Rajah , and pitcher Jimmy Ring . The trade created almost as much consternation in St. Louis at the time as the transaction last night which sent Hornsby to the Braves . Indignation was voiced by fans and civic organizations throughout the city , as Hornsby had come to be St. Louis ' greatest baseball idol . During the playing season of 1927 , however , much of this feeling disappeared , as Frisch performed so brilliantly and at the end of the season finished second to Paul Waner of the Pittsburgh club in the selection of the most valuable player in the National League . Following his transfer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kept him in the public eye , aside from his playing feats . One concerned his holding of stock in the St. Louis club and the other a law suit in which he was named defendant by Frank Moore , a Concinnati betting commissioner , who sued the player for $70,075 for alleged losses in wagers placed on horses . After long negotiations , Hornsby finally accepted $112,000 from Breadon for his shares in the Cards . In the law suit , Hornsby was freed of all claims agains him by a jury verdict . Hornsby also ' performed brilliantly for the Giants . Due to an injury to his back , Hornsby had not played quite up to form during the closing weeks of the 1926 campaign , but last Spring he reported physically fit and turned in one of his greatest playing seasons , though he did not quite succeed in regaining the league batting championship which he held from 1920 to 1925 , inclusive . named him field captain , a post that Frisch previously had held , and his work as a leader evoked almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the closing months of the 1927 IntornatIonal .
