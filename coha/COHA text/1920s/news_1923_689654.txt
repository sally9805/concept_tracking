txt Dr. John Roach Straton , pastor of Calvary Baptist Church , 123 West Fiftyseventh Street , where during this week a series of mass meetings of the Baptist fundamentalists are being held to assert their belief that the Bible is the infallible Word of God , carried the fight against the modernists a step further yesterday . In an address on the menace of modernism in mission fields he charged that the Baptist Foreign Mission boards are in complete control of the modernists , who are " starving " or " freezing " out all - American missionaries who do not accept and promulgate their views . He asserted that In connection with the work in foreign fields a thing " alien to us as Baptists has reared its ugly head "  --  a changed viewpoint concerning the very fundamentals of the Baptist creed . The Baptist leaders are poisoned by modernism , he said . Many modernists , who have been at : . tending the meetings at the church , walked out of the building yesterday afternoon , announcing they " could stand it no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been made from-Dr . Straton 's pulpit , and some threatened to " disrupt " the meetings if the fundamentalists carried out their program as announced . One of these objectors , who It is said nolda a prominent position with the Baptist Theological seminary at Rochester , N. Y. , but who said his name was " John H. Nemo , " after attending the meeting , remarked : -I came out because I could not control a desire to break up the proceedings by rising to my feet and publicly offering up a prayer to God to soften the bitter , unyielding views of these uncompromising dogmatists . Look at the faces of the speakers . They are hard and obstinate . To argue on rational ? grounds with them would be futile . The trouble is there are a lot of silly people who gulp down the fundamentalist fare offered them . Why , they 'll be talking about the infallibility of the Pope next . " Dr. Straton announced yesterday , that the Rev. Charles P. Potter of the We -- Side Unitarian Church , who is chem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has challenged Dr. Straton to a series of three public debates on the fundamentalist tenets , is to meet him today to arrange the details of the debate . Dr. Straton said the first debate would be held early next week , and the other two at intervals of a fortnight , to let the public digest the opposing views and form their own conclusions . " I have no bitter feelings against Dr. Potter , " Dr. Straton said . " and I hope he bears none against me . He has uttered some pretty hard words , but I dare say he has cooled down in the meanwhile . " In his address on foreign mission work Dr. ? Straton said in part : " It is humiliating and most distressing that we should have to admit that we are now torn asunder into warring camps . The old unity and fraternity are gone , and with these things the old time zeal and enthusiasm for the missionary enterprise , of necessity , has also gone in part . Our conventions for years now have been centres of stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , a thing that is alien to us as Baptists , and alien to the New Testament , has reared its ugly head in our midst . A changed viewpoint concerning the very fundamental tenets of our Baptist faith has come into being . and with this changed viewpoint there has come about also a changed emPhasis , and we are divided today because we have lost the unity of , the faith . " So widespread and aggressive has modernism become , upon the foreign fields that the true believers among the missionaries of all denominations have had to come together to form unions for the defense of the faith . The Bible Union in China and similar organizations in India and elsewhere are ample Proofs that the ruinous effects of modernism are widespread upon the foreign field . This is true not only among the Baptist missionaries but the missionaries of all other denominations . " REVIEWS CHURCH HISTORY . Dr. Chorley Tells of Work of St. Thomas 's , 100 Years Old .

The same high motive has governed the liturgical services of this church , and especially the music . Here has been proved the truth of Horace Bushnell 's saying : ' You can not worship long in the beauty of holiness without realizing the holiness of beauty . ' " A. further contribution of St. Thomas 's has been its steadfast witness to the faith of the gospel and the teaching of the Church . The third contribution has been its mission work , and , greatest of all ; this parish has made a notable contribution to the extension of the Kingdom of God .
