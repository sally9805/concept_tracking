Sometimes keenest , shrewdest correspondents are fooled . For example the United Press , Associated Press and even the impeccable London Times asserted , last week , that Italian divers had recovered $2,000,000 in diamonds from the Belgian steamer Elizabethville , which was sunk off the western coast of France , eleven years ago , by a German submarine . <P> Actually all that had been recovered was the diamond safe . When it was opened , last week , in the presence of armed guards and frock coated officials , there was found nothing of value except 1,871 Belgian paper francs and four English gold sovereigns-a total haul of $72 . Probable explanation : after the Elizabethville was torpedoed her captain tried to save the diamonds by embarking with , them in a lifeboat , sank " somewhere in the Atlantic . " Fortunately the Elizabethville ' s hulk contains ten tons of valuable ivory tusks from the Belgian Congo which will now be laboriously raised , thus enabling the disappointed Italian salvage firm to " break even "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
