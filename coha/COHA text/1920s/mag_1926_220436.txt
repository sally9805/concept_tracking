Sunningdale , where the qualifying rounds of the British open championship were played last week , is accounted the hardest inland course in England . There Robert T. Jones went out to qualify last week followed by a number of gentlemen in top hats with racing badges in their lapels , for the King was expected at Ascot that day and these gentlemen wanted , if possible , to be in two places at once . Those of soundest judgment deserted all thought of horse-racing , stayed to watch Jones play two rounds in 134-a stunning 66 , a steady 68-36 holes with but one 5 and one 2-golf of legend . <P> Qualifying play was also held at St. Anne 's .
