In 1889 the Denver Public Library boasted of a fine collection . The librarians worked in peaceful seclusion over its catalogs , browsed undisturbed among the locked shelves . Bolok-seekers seldom dared or had a chance to interrupt them in their solemn labors . But one day the quiet , musty atmosphere of the building was suddenly shattered . John Cotton Dana , a civil engineer , was made Librarian . Declaring the value of a library was not in its collection but circulation , he opened the shelves , removed red-tape , gave Denver citizens a chance to read . When this was accomplished the new Librarian promptly began working on another radical theory , that the library could cooperate with the schools . He soon opened the first children 's department in the country , expanded the function of the library with an art exhibit . <P> When Mr. Dana died last week librarians grieved , paid tribute . Since his Denver days he had gone to Springfield , Mass. , for four years ( 1898-1902 ) and increased that library 's circulation by 47% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was still Librarian at the time of his death . The Newark shelves had 78,798 books when he arrived . Last year it had 391,843 volumes and a 5-to-1 turnover . During his 27 years , two outstanding Dana deeds were the installation of the first U. S. Business Man 's Library and , in 1918 , his refusal to remove " pro-German " books from circulation . <P> When en art museum was begun in the Newark Library , * Librarian Dana insisted that beauty must be associated with utility . One day museumgoers were shocked by an exhibition of modern open-plumbing . Another day Newark art-lovers trooped to see an exhibit arranged , designed and specially announced by Mr. Dana . In whispers they exclaimed over the beauty of the bowls , the form of the colored vases . Wisely they nodded their arty heads over the placard " Beauty has no relation to age , rarity or price . " Then one art-lover gave an exclamation . The others fluttered to the side of the afflicted one , read a little note : " Every article in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than $1 . " <P> <P> * Since 1926 the Newark Art Museum has had its own building .
