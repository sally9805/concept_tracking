A Man with Red Hair . As everyone who read Hugh Walpole 's book knows , A Man with Red Hair concerns a self-immolating masochist whose philosophy is that pain gives power to the pained , makes the sufferer like unto God . Mr. Crispin learned the philosophy from his father who had tortured him as a boy . At Westminster he was different . His flamboyant red hair , pudgy hands and a distorted face which bespoke a grotesque mind , made him different through life . A man of wealth , he indulged his idiosyncratic taste for cruelty and his incongruous love of good etchings . He liked to choke old ladies . He cut the tongues from the mouths of his three Japanese servants . Mr. Crispin has a son whose father-fixation is so unshakable that he agrees to be the nominal husband of a girl whom Mr. Crispin wants to torture . An impulsive young Englishman who loves her , plots to rescue her from the Crispin home . He is aided by an ineffectual young American ( who supplies the only comic relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a place in America , " where he has two sisters , Hetty and Jane , " good girls " ) . Apprehended , the Englishman is bound by the wrists , his back is used as an etching-plate , upon which Mr. Crispin cuts with a surgical scalpel the likeness of an ass . The American is subjected to mental torture . But just as Mr. Crispin , drawing on a surgeon 's blouse , is about to consummate his fiendish plans for the Englishman , the American and the girl , the three dumb Japs , squealing laughter from tongueless mouths , have their own revenge . This is the last scene and is the most thrilling in a season which has tried very hard to provide thrills . Edward G. Robinson ( Mr. Crispin ) and his Garrick Players did well . <P> Hotbed . It is the conviction of those who write plays for Broadway that Puritanism is not a state of mind but a vice ; thus they attack it with knives and reformatory fury , instead of explaining it . Hotbed , like Revolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rev. David Rushbrook . The scene of his hypocritical virtuosities is a college this time , for Author Paul Osborn himself has been a pedagogue . An assistant professor seduced the Rev. Rushbrook 's daughter , after drinking whiskey . <P> The acting in Hotbed is enough to make it somewhat exciting . William Ingersoll is the bad goodman , Alison Bradshaw his daughter , and Richard Stevenson the assistant professor detected in a process of seduction . <P> This Year of Grace was heralded by fanfares , tuckets and sennets such as seldom announce anything less than the birth of a Prince of Wales or the entrance of Lit-tul Lillian Leitzel . Trans-Atlantic commuters who saw its opening at the Pavilion Theatre in London were reduced to choked , ecstatic finger-tip kissing in their attempts to relate its manifold charms . Jesse Matthews , they ultimately gasped , sings " A Room with a View . " . . . Tillie Losch 's fluttering hands , fanciful feet . . . brilliant . . . divine .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
