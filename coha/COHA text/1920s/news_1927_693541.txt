" District Attorney Banton has announced that he will - ask for early dates for all trials foi- alleged indecency in the theatre . " I am very gratified with the turn of events , " Acting Mayor said last night , when informed of Magistrate Renaud 's action . " I think we are going to be very successful with the whole business . " Injunction Hearing Put Off . No action was taken yesterday relating to the injunctions obtained by lawyers for the three raided shows to prevent further police raids . Supreme Court Justice Bijur postponed until today the hearing on the injunctions in the case of " Sex " and " The Virgin Man . " The injunction In the case of " The Captive " had not yel been served on the police . Charles Eno of 51 Chambers Street , lawyer for " Sex , " and Assistant Corporation Counsel Russell Tarbox were summoned to his chambers at 4:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon by Justice Bijur . After the conference Mr. Eno said : " Justice Bijur suggested a procedure to facilitate the disposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other lawyers interested agree . I am not at liberty to tell what it is . " Asked if the plan involved the voluntary closing of the three shows , Mr. Eno said : " No . By no means . " Murray Hulbert , former President of the Board of Aldermen , who represented Miss Smith , a defendant in " The Virgin Man " case , caught the attention of Magistrate Renaud at the opening of the hearing yesterday by arguing that if the police were justified in arresting the actors and actresses in " The Virgin Man , " they should also have arrested the audience . He contended that the actors and the audience were guiltless and that the crime , if one had been committed , was solely that of the producer and manager . " It would be certainly just as logical to arrest the audience as to arrest the actors and actresses , " said Mr. Hulbert . Magistrate Renaud ruled against him on this point . Inspector Tells What He Saw . The first and only witness was Inspector Cummings . Assistant District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen . After a word or two about the stage setting of the first act Inspector Cummings came to the entrance of a character named Hughey , played by Mr. Dillaway . " Now , " he continued , " Hughey was a very bashful and unsophisticated young man who met Peggy who was ? " " Wait , " shouted Mr. Hulbert . " Stop right there . I object , " said Nathan Wolf , lawyer for several of the actors . " I object . I object , " said Sam Hoffman , lawyer for Mr. Dugan , the author and producer . The Inspector , a man of genial countenance and ruddy complexion , sat back blinking and bewildered . " You must n't say ' unsophisticated , ' " said Magistrate Renaud . " It 's all right to say ' young man ' or FYale man , ' " said the Magistrate . " Which was it ? " " He was both , " replied Inspector Cummings . Thera was an argument as to whether the Inspector should be permitted to refresh his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . This was allowed , and at length the witness started again : " Peggy had a conversation with Hughey. flirting with " Objections were again shot at the ' witness from three sides , and Magistrate Renaud admonished the witness against the use of the word " flirting . " Inspector Cummings was plainly baffled at the criticisms of his choice of language and began groping slowly through his vocabulary , offering words one at a time , showing relief each time one went unobjected to . One lawyer cut in with a general argument that the witness should be required to recite the exact text used on the stage or ordered to keep his peace . " Not being the seventh son of a seventh son , he ca n't give you every word verbatim , " said Assistant District Attorney - Wallace . " But a witness can be asked to state the substance of a conversation . " Mr. Wallace then put another question intended to bring out the conversation of Peggy and Hughey . Mr. Hulbert cut in with : " I object to that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in the evidence . " " Objection overruled , " said the Court . The stenographer was ordered to read the question , and the jovial but puzzled police censor continued : " Why , Hughey told her that he was a half-brother of Conway , and that he had been invited to the apartment to meet the bride of Conway on his return from Paris , and frequently during the course of the conversation . Peggy would approach very clo , sely to Hughey and would raise her mouth as though attempting to kiss him . " " I object to that and move to strike it out . " " I also object to that , " cried another voice , " as the conclusion of the witness and move ? " " It was not , " retorted the hitherto passive Inspector , becoming suddenly belligerent , " it was not a conclusion . She held her lips this way  --  just like -- Frantic objections interrupted him again . A hot argument developed , which the Magistrate cut short by say-ing : " I think it Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman takes when about to commit osculation . Proceed . " Lawyers Keep tut the Attack . ' " When Peggy would reach the position that she was just about to kiss Hughey , Hughey would draw back in an embarrassed fashion ? " Three lawyers opened fire on the word " embarrassed . " Even the Assistant Attorney did not attempt to defend that brazen adjective . " Stricken out , " said the Magistrate . " All right , " said Inspector Cummings . " Would draw back , then . He would draw back and Peggy would follow . She would continue the conversation and raise herself on her toes and begin to appear about to kiss Hughey , and Hughey would begin to withdraw . " " Now , after this scene , what took place ? " asked the Prbsecutor . The Inspector proceeded with the entrance of Nellie . Over , through and around objections the police official told how Nellie , another extremely forward young person , had kept Hughey retreating about the stage to save himself from being petted on short acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Describing one garment from Paris , he continued : " She said it was all lace . " " All what ? " interrupted Mr. Hulbert . " All what ? " demanded Mr. Hoffman . " All what ? " demanded Mr. Hoffman . " All lace , " replied the Inspector . " It was all lace . " Then the Inspector got started on another conversation between Peggy and Hughey . It was getting late in the afternoon and the lawyers were getting tired of objecting : The Inspector was allowed to move swiftly along with his tale . He told of the admirable defense the Yale student made for two and a half acts against greater numerical odds than Parsifal and St. Anthony resisted . Reform Workers in Court . Canon William Sheafe Chase , who was seated in the second row of the courtroom , looked up from a brochure entitled " Sin and . Its Forgiveness . " H. L : Barber of the Society for the Prevention of Crime and Charles J. Bamberger , special agent of the New York Society for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no further wrangling until a. tabloid newspaper photograph was offered as evidence of the alleged indecency on the stage . Inspector Cummings identified the photograph as a very exact picture of what is said to be the high spot of the drama . " May I , for the sake of the record , . have it noted that this appeared in a newspaper Balled : ' The Daily Mir ; ror ' ? " asked Mr. Wolf . " No objection , " said the prosecutor . Inspector Cummings then described how Hughey had denounced one of his temptresses . The Inspector quoted Hughey as saying : " Those words are embedded here ( referring to his head ) in letters of fire . " Mr. Dugan ' shook his head like an outraged literary man over that quotation . The third act , as detailed by Inspector , Cummins and called by him  --  the most objectionable in the whole play , involved a scene between Mr. Dillaway as Hughie and Miss Hall as Elsa on a darkened stage . Hughie and Elsa enacted this scene , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hughie unhooked - Elsa 's gown , according to the witness , and then she , clad in a lacy black step-in ; put her arms about his neck and kissed him . The Inspector admitted , on cross-examination , that this was the first kiss of the performance in which persons of opposite sexes figured . The next big legal ' argument was whether the technical term " step-in " could be admitted in evidence . Mr. Hulbert argued that it was a trade name which had no standing in AngloSaxon , jurisprudence . Mr. Wallace fought for the word . The lawyers for the-defense were divided as to whether the Court ought to kill the word or let it live . He Describes the Garment . The argument finally , died out and Inspector Cummings went on : " This step-in was black . " " Was it filmy ? " " Yes . " The Inspector added , however , that it was not transparent . It was not of solid cloth , he insisted , but when a photograph of Elsa that had been placed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been mistaken and that the garment was partly made of . solid cloth . " And was not her dressing gown composed of . " solid ostrich feathers ? " demanded- Mr : Wolf . " I never heard of a solid ostrich feather , " said Mr Wallace . " That 's enough of that , " said the Magistrate . " Let us proceed without any further ' levity . " On cross-examination Mr. Hulbert asked : " Do you know if any proceedings have been taken against the publication of this photograph ? " An objection here was sustained . Mr. Hulbert then brought out the fact that the seating capacity of the theatre was 299 . " And have you any idea how many people have seen this newspaper ? " he continued . That again was objected to . Mr. Hulbert then argued that no case had been made out against his clients . Mr. Wolf and Mr. Hoffman also argued for dismissals , but the Magistrate decided there was reasonable cause to hold the defendants for Special Sessions . Three " Through " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alden , three members of the cast , had said during an intermission of the hearing that they were " through " and would act no more In " The Virgin Man . " Mr. Dugan had difficulties in putting on the performance last night , but finally at 9 o'clock the curtain went up . The only announced change was that Dorothy Tierney had taken the place of Betty Alden . Miss Hall - and Mr. Dillaway said . hey had agreed to continue in their r8les only until substitutes could be found . The producer and cast of " The Captive " were arraigned in Jefferson Market Court yesterday , but the actual examination was postponed until today because of the amount of time consumed in the case of " The Virgin Man . " The cast and manager of " Sex " are scheduled for examination today , in the West Side Court .
