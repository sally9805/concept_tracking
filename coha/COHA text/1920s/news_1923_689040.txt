txt Edivard M. Fuller , head of the bankrupt brokerage firm of E. M. Fuller er Co. , who with his partner , William F .. , pleaded guilty on Wednesday to bucketing the orders of customers , did not appear yesterday before Harold P. Coffin , referee in bankruptcy , to disclose secrets of his firm . Instead of the anticipated ' confession , " which was expected to reveal the names of persons " higher up " in the " bucket-shop ring " and give details of his firm 's $6,000,000 failure . Fuller 's attendance at the bankruptcy hearing at Mr. Coffin 's office at 217 Broadway was prevented by illness and a certificate signed by Dr. Max J. Siegelstein , prison physician of the Ludlow Street Jail , was produced . Mr. Siegelstein , who is an appointee of Sheriff Pero-iv-al E. Nagle , a Tammany district leader , certified that Fuller was suffering from nervous . exhaustion and should remain in bye for several days . ; tt , . , Fuller 's failure to A . appear before the referee disclosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eitittaion and had*ku0:11 , uliei under examination for nearly an hour and a half the night before . Fuller . who is confined in the Ludlow Street Jail under a contempt of court order by Judge Henry W. Goddard of the United States District Court , for failure to produce Certain documents , was taken to the Federal Building by a Deputy United States Marshal . He was to have been taken before Colonel , Hayward again yesterday morning at .19 o'clock , an hour before he was due to appear in the bankruptcy proceedings , but the Deputy Marshal , on his arrival at the jail , was informed that Fuller was ill . Colonel Hayward refused to discuss his examination of Fuller in any way , even when informed that the opinion had been expressed that his injection into the situation had made it more difficult to obtain  --  a confession from FulI ler implicating others . " I did it in the ? interest of justice and of the people of New York State and the United States , " Colonel Hayward said . " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Inquiry . From another source it was learned that Colonel Hayward , doubting the power of the District Attorney of New York County to make as thorough an investigation as might be , desirable , had decided to make an exhaustive inquiry into the operations of brokerage firms that have been suspected of bucketing . It was said to be Colonel Hayward 's belief that there was a " bucket-shop ring , " which could be broken if even one member , could be induced to confess . , Colonel Hayward was said to believe that there was an excellent opportunity to obtain admissions from Fuller . Although Fuller and his partner , , have pleaded guilty to a crime in the State courts , they are actually In the custody of the Federal Court by Judge Goddard 's contempt order . The general belief is that the documents for failure to produce which they have been declared in contempt have been destroyed and that there is little opportunity for them to be discharged from their present imprisonment . Fuller &; *Co. were indicted in the United States District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firma on a charge of using the mails to defraud in connection with the promotion of the Crown Oil Company . Colonel Hayward was said to have assigned assistants to work on this indictment , the assistant originally in charge having left the Federal service . He was also reported to have found evidence which ' in his opinion might be used for other criminal prosecution of the Fuller firm . Colonel Hayward was also reported to feel that the Federal authorities might be freer to prosecute a general bucket shop inquiry than the local officials . For example , it was said , the District Attorney was elected by Tammany and certain Tammany connections have been shown between members of Tarntnany and some of the bankrupt brokerage firms against which charges have been made . Questioned About Foley . Colonel Hayward is understood to have questioned Fuller closely Wednesday night concerning the testimony before Referee Coffin of Thomas F. Foley , former Sheriff and veteran Tammany leader , and Charles A. Stoneham concerning the advancing of $15,000 by Foley and $147,500 by Stoneham to the Fuller firm in an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether Colonel Hayward obtained any information . Fuller refused to answer any questions regarding the connection , if any , between Foley or Stoneham and his firm before Referee Coffin Wednes- day afternoon . His refusal was on the ground that to do so might tend to incriminate or degrade him . Fuller 's failure to appear before Referee Coffin yesterday morning caused considerable excitement for a time , and Francis B. Fallon of counsel for the Fuller creditors made a motion to cite United States Marshals William C. Hecht for contempt of court . The motion was permitted to die after explanations were received . Mr. Hecht explained that when a Deputy Marshal reported that Fuller was ill he called for a certificate of the prison physician , and did not receive this until nearly noon , too late to notify Mr. Coffin . The certificate read as follows : New York County Jail 70 Ludlow Street Eugene A. Johnson . Warden Perceival E. Nagle , Sheriff . C ' . Deent , United States Marshal . Dear Sir : I have this day examined prisoner Fuller and find him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed a few days . Respectfully yours . Dr. SIEGELSTEIN . The certificate was produced before Referee Coffin by Chief Deputy United States Marshal John Kahnengieser at the beginning of the afternoon session . Mr. Coffin ordered the Marshal to producesFuller before him this morning at 11 o sloes. if possible , and if not to produce him at that time at the earliest possible day . The first witness at the referee 's hearing was Arthur Pelham West . Vice President of the ' National Surety Company , who gave formal testimony concerning the bond furnished by that company for Fillies. and for which the Stock Exchange firm of Einstein . ward &; Co. and Arnold Rothstein were the indemnifiers . Mr. Einstein said that arrangements for going on the partners ' bonds were made ta- his partner , Marshall E. Ward . lie sari he had ( *Sleeted at first but was assured by Mr. Ward that no harm could come to their firm and that , having done much business with Fuller &; Co .. they ought to do this favor . Mr. Einstein said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm 's failure were erroneous . Ile said be knew Rothstein in a business at ? . the latter having been a customor et his firm but without en account . " Mr. Rothstein always bought and sold for cash , " Mr. Einstein said . Leo M. Morris , a former customer of &; Co. , who apparently owed the firrna2.000 when it suspended business , said that he-I ; neW little of this account , as it had been started for him by who was a personal friend and who had offered to make some money for him . Mr. Morris explained a . $5,000 check to him , a short time before the firm failed . by saying that had asked him to cash it and that he had paid over the money to immediately . He denied that his name had been used by the firm for its own purposes . J. J. , an accountant , testified that he had been employed to make investigations for the Consolidated Stock Exchange and that he had investigated R. H. &; Co. and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of its Ways and Means Committee that in his opinion &; Co. were insolvent . Mr. fixed the date of this report as Feb. 7 , 1921 , then said he was not certain , and finally declared that he believed this was the date . Howard J. Bell . Mr. 's assistant . sa:cl he did not believe this was the correct date , and attempted to speak to while the latter was on the stand . William M. Chadbourne. attorney for the 4.000 Fuller creditors , objected . and ? charged that Mr. Silkworth and the latter 's attorney had attempted to influence the witness to change the date . The reason for Mr. Chadbourne 's insistence upon Feb. 7 as the date appeared when Thomas N. Willies , accountant for the trustee , testified that on - Feb. 9 &; Co. received from Fuller &; Co. a check for $5,000 as part of that firm 's contribution to a $100,000 ' ? defense fund " raised among Consolidated Stock Exchange members . It was Mr. Chadbourne 's contention that , if Mr. Silkworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insolvency of &; Co. before the Fuller &; Co. check for $5.000 was drawn , that it would he possible for the trustee to recover ibis amount . William E. Bishop , head of Bishop 's Service , frequently employed as an Investigator by the Consolidated Stock Exchange . gave the names of . a , number of firms and individuals which had been admitted to membership after an adverse report from him . In previous testimony Mr. Bishop named as firms the Consolidated had admitted after an unfavorable report , Clarke &; Hubbard , H. C. Strurnpf . Kardos &; Burke , P. C. Mason &; Co. , Sacker &; Co. , J. M. Gregory of Darrell . Gregory &; Co. , and J. C. Rabiner &; Co. in addition to these he named the following : Sullivan &; Co. , J. D. Sugarman &; Co. , C. A.

B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lilly and 011ie Gore . The secret examination of Fuller before the referee on Wednesday was disclosed yesterday by copies of the stenographer 's minutes . Before the examination began Bugene F. , of counsel for Fuller , declared that Fuller , who had pleaded guilty in the Court of General Sessions a short time previously , had been under such a strain that it would be cruel and inhuman to examine him . Fuller also asked for an adjournment to give him opportunity to consult his counsel , William J. Fallon . Mr. contended that , although Fuller had pleaded guilty in the State courts , his constitutional privilege on what might tend to incriminate4him still existed in the Federal courts. - The referee instructed Fuller that he could stand on this privilege . Carl J. Austrian , of counsel for the trustee , said that on previous examinations Fuller had refused to answer cluestions concerning his assets , and now had an opportunity . " . You do n't need to he nervous , " Mr. Coffin said to Fuller . " I ca n't help being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued : " I think , your Honor , that if you give me until tomorrow to talk to Mr. Hays Arthur Garfield Hays his counsel in the bankruptcy proceedings and to talk to Mr. Fallon about many things I wish to consult him on , I may answer a good many questions that you possibly would like to know . As I say , I was taken over hers on a minute 's notice , without time to consult anybody , and I do n't know what action may be taken against me on these answers to certain questions . I think if you really want to help this hearing . I think if you could give me until tomorrow morning I would be in a better position to know just what I will do after talking over matters . I do n't think that is asking a great deal , Your Honor , considering the fact that I have had to plead guilty in.General Sessions this morning- and have been taken away and brought over here without time to consult anybody . " " I think your Honor has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Might Answer Many Questions . " I have asked his Honor to reconsider that , " said Fuller . " The suggestion that 1 made to you is sincere . I think tomorrow A mai. - possibly answer a great many questions . ' I think perhaps we had better make some headway now , " said the referee . " There is no reason why any one should consult any one to tell the truth . " " Suppose the truth should incriminate him ? " asked Mr. . Mr. Austrian then asked a number of questions , to all of Which Fuller an-swered : ' ? I refuse to answer on the ground that it might tend to incriminate or degrade d me . " These questions included queries as to his duties with Fuller &; Co. , his power to sign checks , whether he would make any statement as to his assets , whether he knew women by the names of Florence Ely and Gertrude Vanderbilt , whether he was married , whether he had made gifts of money or jewelry to his wife before bankruptcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books of the Wireless Improvement Company were kept in the office of Fuller &; Co . Fuller also claimed on the same grounds his privilege of refusing to answer the following questions : " Who were the members of the firm of E. M. Fuller &; Co. on June 26 , 1922 ? " Were there any special partners in that firm ? " What interest , if any , did Charles A. Stoneham have in the firm of E. M. Fuller &; Co. ? What interest , it any , did Thomas F. Foley have in the firm of E. M. Fuller &; Co. ? " Did you ask Thomas F. Foley to advance money to E. M. Fuller &; Co. in April , May or June , 1922 ? " Did you ask Charles A. Stoneham at any time to advance money to the firm of B. M. Fuller &; Co. ? " Fuller refused to answer a number of other questions , as to whether he had a personal account with M. W.
