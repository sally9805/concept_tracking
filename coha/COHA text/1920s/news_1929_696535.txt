txt The advance in industrial share prices lost none of its vigor in yesterday 's trading , although leadership showed a tendency to shift from U. S. Steel to other high-grade industrials . After a strong opening and a further advance to record territory during the early trading there was a moderate set-back in Steel which ruled at a level slightly above the preceding day 's close . Constructive-interests turned to other representative industrials , and in thus category . General Electric . American Can , and Westinghouse Electric gave impressive demonstrations . A sharp advance in Consolidated Gas at the opening stimulated trading attention in the public utilities , and Brooklyn Union Gas , Public Service of New Jersey , National Power &; Light , and American &; Foreign Power responded to this influence with broad gains .

The current high rate of activity is indicated by estimates that United States Steel is operating at 97% of capacity , compared with a rate of around 80f , ; - . a year ago . Encouraging developments were recorded in cables from The Hague Conference . With the British more conciliatory in their demands . questions which threatened to break up the conference will be the subject of friendly discussion and it is believed-sufficient concessions can be made to enable the acceptance of the Snowden proposals . ? ? ? A favorable development in the credit situation is the anticipated movement of gold from London to this center . It is estimated that upwards of $5,000,000 of the yellow metal is awaiting shipment with prospect that another export movement . ilseilar to those in February and June is getting underway . Foreign financial circles interpret this factor as indicating an early advance in the Bank of England rate , notwithstanding that Montagu Norman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there would be no advance in the rate this week . ? ? ? There has been plenty of good news to attract favorable attention to the motion picture storks . During the past few days . Paramount , Fox and Warner have announced plans for strengthening their positions in the theatre field . In addition to this , the operating results of these companies during the first half of the year have shown marked improvement as Judiceted by reports of the gains in Paramount business , and earnings of Fox Film which in the first six . months were equal to $6.11 a share on 920.660 A and B shares against $3.45 on 767. - 216 shares a year ago . Fox 's June quarter earnings were more than double those of a yer.r ago . Entering a more active season in the Fall , it is expected that the gains shown will not only be continued but improved . Buttericli gold up sharply on expectation that . the forthcoming statement for the first six months of the year will show some improvement a8 compared with a year ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since advertising business has been somewhat behind a year ago . Management has been concentrating on the editorial and circulation end of its publications , particularly the Delineator , with satisfactory results , and is at present beginning on its 1930 advertising campaign , with indications in current bookings that large increases in this department will be shown . July copper statistics were well received and Anaconda sold at the highest levels of the movement . Notwithstanding a heavy volume of trading in Anaconda , the stock appears to be having more difficulty in recapturing lost ground than other active features . On Tuesday the turnover in Anaconda amounted to over 335,000 shares with an advance of 2% points at the close . In contrast , the turnover in Steel was 488,000 shares with a gain of ** points . Yesterday Anaconda closed with a decline , despite a volume about equal to Steel 's . American Can was an outstanding feature of the industrial section , advancing on prospects of expanding business in the Canadian market as indicated by recent developments in that territory . The company has recently closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating facilities a ' Toronto to develop this business as well as other lines in Canada . As pointed out here recently , sentiment In oil circles has undergone considerable change for the better in the past week or so , although statistics have not revealed any startling change in trend of production . The first decline in daily production since May 11. reported for last week , along with the ability of the mid-continent wholesale gasoline market to increase 12 cent a gallon recently , are favorable factors . Of more importance , because they are behind the better gasoline price , are the renewal of conservation movement in Oklahoma , and the expectation of results from the new California gas law which goes into effect September 1 . Designed to prevent wastage of natural gas , effectual operation of the law would reduce excess crude yield there . Support of the law is being urged by major oil companies in California . ? The rapidity of the advance during the past four sessions has been followed by a more conservative buying attitude toward leading industrials in some quarters until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad issues is considered a logical development if profit-taking in other sections becomes active . As pointed out by Dow-Jones &; Co. 27 leading dividend paying railroad common stocks are selling at an average of 12 times earnings for the 12 months ended June , 1929 , with an average yield of 4.2% . Highest yields are shown by Frisco , Southern , Rock Island , Illinois Central , Kansas City Southern and Atlantic Coast Line . Lowest ratios to earnings were in Chesapeake &; Ohio .

Baltimore &; Ohio is expected to cover its $G rate twice over . Erie common is ? in line for initial dividends . Pennsylvania selling at about 10 times earnings shows a relatively high yield on its dividend . An interesting contrast is furnished in ? elation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Railroad issues range from 9.7 times earnings to 17.4 times . Sixteen representative utilities , on the other hand , are selling at from 20 to 36.2 times earnings for the 12 months ended June 20 . ? During the early afternoon call funds were marked clown to 6% , the lowest rate since July 3 . This development apparently ' had little feet on the market 's action as a whole , although new leaders were brought forward selling at new high prices . The motor shares , for the most part , were neglected , sowing an absence of buying demand and some selling in issues whose position seems less favorable than a year ago . GrahamPaige dropped to a new low for the year on ' mattered liquidation following the company 's report for the first six months of the year , which showed a decline in profits as compared with a year ago . The motor shares have had little participation in the advance in the market . Interests who have been prominent in previous active markets in this group are inclined to believe that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the year ire better defined . Prices of the leading issues . considering past earnings records , are apparently on a conservative basis measured by current market valuations in other groups . On the other hand there is no particular speculative icentive for operations in this group , with all signs pointing to a lower volume of sales in the last half of the year . lower earnings , and price-cutting more or less general . New models announcements will probably stimulate some issues during the next few weeks . On this basis , some attention has been attracted to Hupp which is bringing out a popular priced six cylinder car which promises to greatly increase its market A sidelight on this development affects Midland Steel Products Co . The new six is equipped with Midland steel hydraulic four-wheel brakes Hupmoblle was the first car to adopt Midland fourwheel hydraulic brakes early in 1928 , and they have since been used en all Hupp model. , A number of other well-known makes of cars are now using these brakes and the +company has recently gotten under way on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased business anticipated . ? ? ? Irregularity developed during the late trading with Steel receding under liberal offerings . Radio came out of its recent inactivity with a spirited advance of several points . Good scale buying developed in American Can at levels just under its record high price . Rubber and motor shares became more active on the decline at fractional recessions .
