Grigorie J. Sokolnikov , newly appointed Soviet Ambassador to Britain , arrived in London fortnight ago , bought a new dress suit in which to present his credentials to King George , and waited . Eight days passed . Conservatives , chuckling at a chance to embarrass the Labor Government , stood up in Parliament and loudly asked why the new Soviet Ambassador had not been received . Foreign Secretary " Uncle Arthur " Henderson scowled . <P> " The delay is entirely our fault , " said he enigmatically , " not his . " What " Uncle Arthur " meant , what every M. P. and most well-informed Londoners knew , was that the delay was really the fault of His Majesty the King-Emperor . Stubbornly , and to the huge embarrassment of his Labor Government , George V refused to shake the hand of any representative of Soviet Russia , for it was the Soviet Government which decreed the assassination in 1918 of a brown-bearded , nervous little man known to the world as His Imperial Majesty Nicholas II , Tsar of All the Russias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear Cousin Nicky . " <P> Though Britain began full diplomatic relations with the Soviet in 1924 , the necessity of shaking hands with the Tsar 's murderers did not arise . At that time Russia had only a charg d'affaires in London , and mere chargs need not meet the Crown . Ambassadors are different , but all last week Cousin George V remained adamant . " I have not forgotten , " said he . <P> Finally it was Edward of Wales who saved an embarrassing situation . He was still officially a member of the Regency Council appointed to deputize for King George ( TIME , Dec. 10 , 1928 ) , and for duty 's sake he would shake hands with anyone . Relieved palace officials announced that His Majesty was " too ill " to receive the new Ambassador , that the Prince of Wales would act in his father 's place . <P> Dutifully Edward of Wales dressed himself in the scarlet and blue of the Welsh Guards , strewed medals on his chest , clapped a monumental fur busby on his head and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance of St. James 's Palace proper . <P> Britain 's welcome to the Soviet Ambassador , though delayed , was sumptuous . Two coaches from the royal stable carried the Communist party from their hotel to St. James 's . Scarlet-coated footmen were on the box , Ambassador Sokolnikov , trying to look proletarian under his silk hat , sat inside with Major-General Sir John Hanbury-Williams , diplomatic corps marshal . In the Ambassadors ' Court at St. James 's Palace , the Reds were met by four of the King 's marshalmen in peaked caps and Elizabethan costumes ( resembling a cross between the Jack of Hearts and a master of hounds ) , and Mr. J. B. Monk of the Foreign Office . Sir John Hanbury-Williams led the party to the throne room where Edward of Wales shook hands with a representative of the murderers of his father 's cousin .
