The doorbell at the home of Joseph Adams , 300-pound mayor of West City , Ill. , rang one evening . Mayor Adams went to the door , opened it , and was shot dead by two young men . The bullets were poisoned , to make doubly sure that the wounds would be fatal . <P> In 1926 , Charles Birger , lean gang chieftain of Williamson county , in which lies bloody Herrin , had paid the two young men $50 apiece to kill Mayor Adams . His conviction for first degree murder was regarded as having finally put an end to Herrin atrocities . Last week final appeals failed . He was to be hanged by the neck on Friday , April 13 , unless Governor Len Small , famed pardoner , intervened .
