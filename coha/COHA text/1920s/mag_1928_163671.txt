The Duke of Almodovar and Count Cimera each addressed furious open letters , last week , to General Don Miguel Primo de Rivera , Marquis de Estella , Prime Minister and Dictator of Spain . <P> Bitterly Duke and Count complained that their honor had been sullied by the Marquis . What did he mean , they asked in effect , by breaking off his engagement with the Senorita Mercedes de Castellanos ( TIME , June 18 ) and giving as his reason her " imprudent and inexplicable " conduct in appearing on the Madrid Stock Exchange accompanied by the Duke and Count ? <P> To neither of these nobles does it seem " inexplicable " that a pretty woman should accept their joint escort ; and to suggest that she was " imprudent " in so doing is clearly a dueling matter . <P> Since dictators are proverbially above honor , dueling , and stooping to answer open letters , General Primo de Rivera contented himself , last week , with observing to reporters : " My position does not permit me to be at the disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would seek to involve me in a personal dispute . " <P> Such an attitude violates all canons of Spanish honor . Therefore , last week , most Spanish statesmen not of the dictator 's own faction pointedly absented themselves from a State Ball given at the Royal Palace in Madrid . <P> His Most Catholic Majesty , King Alfonso XIII , now admittedly under the dictator 's heavy thumb , continued to evince no sign of distaste for General Primo de Rivera .
