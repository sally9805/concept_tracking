txt Coming in the midst of general rejoicings over Locarno , the report of a Greek ultimatum to Bulgaria , whether confirmed or not , points to one pressing task for the new Concert of Europe acting through the League of Nations . RAM ear has just said that no more great European wars will be fought over the Rhine frontier , ' but that there are danger spots east of the Rhine . He referred to new minorities living under new flags and to that ancient Balkan kettle where old hatreds are now seasoned with big refugee problems . Such danger spots are less dangerous now that the main powder magazines have been Wetted down . But Looarno is not so old and Europe is not so secure that it , can afford to have sparks flying about . From the Balkans have come many woes to Europe , and it is Europe 's right and duty to stamp out that particular focus of infection . This work of sanitation must be carried on along two lines . Concretely , the League of Nations will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of minorities . Macedonia , after thirty years of guerrilla war , racial and religious proselytizing at the dagger 's point , full-dress wars and frontier changes , may be described as one great inextricable minority . For the peace of Europe the minority rights embodied In the peace treaties and entrusted to the League of Nations are second in importance only to the self-denying ordinance adopted by the Powers at Locarno . It may yet be necessary for the League to step in and demarcate a Macedonia wherein order shall be maintained under League direction .

In the first place , self-preservation is a basic right ; the Powers are Justified In preventing dangerous bonfires from being lit in their own back yards . In the second place , the Powers may with good grace call upon the little nations to go slow on national pride and " honor , " seeing that the Powers themselves have made notable surrenders In that direction . If France and Germany in the interest of European Peace consent to neutral zones , to universal arbitration , to things which only a few years ago would have been regarded as limitations upon their sovereignty , they are Justified In summoning the smaller members of the European family to make similar sacrifices . The pre-war Concert of Europe managed the Balkan problem on the principle of hush and living from hand to mouth , while keeping an eye open for individual profits . The new Concert of Europe must devote itself to settling the Balkan problem for the peace of the Continent .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
