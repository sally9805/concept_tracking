Women may never feel truly emancipated as long as the proceedings of their literary , musical and dramatic organizations are usually reported under the heading of SOCIETY rather than under the heading of ART . Perhaps such reporting is a grave injustice , yet male scoffers do not entirely lack evidence for their feeling that , when women who combine the Arts with their Clubs , meet , the most vital issue before them is the question of who will pour the tea . <P> Last week , for example , the Chicago chapter of the League of American Pen Women lost an active and gained an honorary president with no literary principle involved either in the subtraction or the addition . Trouble began when some 175 members of the chapter gathered at the Union League Club , Chicago , for an annual luncheon which Mrs. Edith Rockefeller McCormick was expected to attend " with ten guests . " But came no Mrs. McCormick , no ten guests , no word from her . <P> The penwomen bore no grudge , elected Mrs. McCormick their honorary president , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penwoman because she has helped to translate some 20 opera librettos into English . <P> Opposition , however , did develop , and strenuously . For up stood Mrs. Henry R. Rathbone , wife of Congressman Rathbone of Illinois and state president of the chapter , announced that if Mrs. McCormick after having failed to be on hand at the meeting , was made honorary president , her only recourse would be to resign forthwith . Whereupon Mrs. McCormick was made honorary president , by a vote of approximately 172 to 3 , and Mrs. Rathbone kept her promise . <P> Said Mrs. Rathbone , later : " I regret that Mrs. McCormick is not more dependable . Such lack of cooperation is deplorable . In order to continue in this work , I would need dependable officers , the kind of women one can count on . The League apparently can expect little co-operation from Mrs. McCormick , and without such co-operation I , at least , can be of no further use as president of the Illinois Chapter . <P> " I am through with all club life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall devote myself to literature !
