Say " tabloid " to Italian-speaking Easterners and they think of the conservative Corriere d'America ( circulation , 56,369 ) , a terse , thoroughgoing little Manhattan daily founded in 1922 to print news , not girl and horror pictures . <P> Last week the Corriere changed its page size from among the smallest to the very largest in the U. S. , 18 x 24 in. , or in. wider and 1 ? in. longer than standard . <P> Editor Luigi Barzini explained in an editorial : <P> 1 ) " Tabloids " have come to be known , not for their handy size but for the low-matter most of them print . <P> 2 ) Corriere needed more room because of enlarged news service . <P> 3 ) " To permit . . . offering in the first page the characteristic news of the day . " <P> Not without humor , Editor Barzini described a little-suspected shortcoming of the tabloid-size newspaper . When the Corriere first started , he related , a laborer wrote in from Trenton , N. J. , and said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much , but it is too small to wrap my lunch in . " Added Editor Barzini : " There was torn from our eyes the veil of the mysteries of certain newspaper circulations . " <P> Editor Barzini 's editorial , unlike the rest of Corriere d'America , was printed in English so that all might understand . That did not prevent the non-tabloid , but tabloidesque , New York World from front-paging : <P> TABLOID ALTERS FORM ; <P> A LUNCH WRAPPER NOW <P> Editor Says Workingman 's Complaint Led to Change in Size .
