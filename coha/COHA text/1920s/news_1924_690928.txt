txt REAR ADMIRAL BRADLEY A. FISKE , retired , fears that the United States , with a people accustomed to wealth and luxury and encouraged to believe in the futility of war , is becoming an effeminate nation . He asserts that the most Virile nations are the ones that do not fear to look war in the face , and that it is the duty of every nation to keep itself prepared for war . The Admiral expressed ' Ms opinion that America was becoming ' effeminized in an address at the Church of the Heavenly Rest and later elaborated , his views in an interview with a representative of TUB New Mane TIMES . For many years he has been an advocate of military preparedness , and at the outbreak of the World War Admiral Fiske predicted in a report to the Secretary of the Navy that the United States would become involved in the conflict . " The three most virile nations are Germany . Russia and Japan , " Admiral Flake began . " You ask me why . I answer because none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each accepts war as one of the facts of life and reasons about it in a logical way . All of them devote the highest efforts of their mind and will-power to warfare . This attitude still persists in Germany , although at the present moment it is submerged on account oreconomic necessities . Russia may not be what one would call a warlike nation , but she is an intensely virile one . Japan 's Virility and spirit are recognized and Admired the world over . " " And how do you regard France ? " Rational Arbitration and Virility . " I do not believe that France is militaristic now , " Admiral Fiske replied , " except in so far as she Is afraid . of Germany , and with good reason . I fancy the militarism of the French died out with Napoleon . who made them sick of war . I do not think that any nation today desires war for the sake of war . But I feel sure that all of them want the material benefits that victory in war usually confers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve it exhibits the greatest degree of virility . And any nation which has at its head a man of the stamp of Bismarck ? I name him to characterize the type of man I have in mind -- Is certain to be fired by the ambition and determination that such a man inspires in it . " Admiral Fiske was asked to classify Some of the other great powers . " France , England and the United States are all effeminized in comparison with Germany , Russia and Japan . " he replied . " Of course , no nation is wholly virile or wholly effeminized . In all nations there is a streak of the one and Or the other . But France , England and the United States all suffer from the most dangerous sort of **28;442;TOOLONG of thought If a nation refuses even to think of war it can not prepare for war even mentally and therefore can not prepare practically . " In England Lord Roberts and Lord Fisher preached preparedness for years ; but their arguments and appeals were received with jeers and insults . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , whom he had served so well , is one of the most regrettable facts in history . Great Britain expiated her neglect by the death of the best and strongest of her manhood , and by everything that is deplorable in national life , excep ' national ruin itself . Fall of Decadent Nation .. ' We know that Assyria fell before the barbarian Persian ; that Persia fell before the barbarian Greek . and that Rome fell before the barbarian Alaric . All these countries , however , were decadent countries , and we accept the fact of their decadence as the explanation of their fall . But was Great Britain decadent ? Germany said so . Of course , she was not decadent in the degree that Assyria and Persia and Egypt were , for Great Britain was in the very flower of a civilization supposed to be the most beautiful the world had ever seen . " The answer to the question , of course , depends on the definition of the Word decadent ' In default of an agreement as to that definition we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we can easily decide whether , during the first fourteen years of the twentieth century , the British acted as worthy descendants of Harold and Alfred and the Black Prince and of Marlborough and Nelson and William Pitt . " " And France ? " " Even more than Great Britain , in proportion to her danger from Germany , France became Increasingly unprepared for war , as war drew near , " said the Admiral . " In 1889 the requirements for compulsory military service had been reduced from five to three years . and in 1905 the period of service was again reduced , this time to two years . These facts , coupled with the increase in socialistic agitation , the absence of any commanding personality that could direct the energies of the people , the lack Of continuous interest in public affairs and especially the ardent pursuit of luxury and pleasure by all classes were of sinister importance . The orators of France told sweet stories to people who Wished to have such stories told them . Suddenly the storm broke out , and France was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woman 's Influence in America . " In this country , during the period beetween 1870 and 1914 , the progress in the development of commerce , ' industry and invention was greater than in any other country , and the spread of pacificisrn was also greater . This Spread of pacificism was due mainly to two causes  --  the influence of the doctrines Of Thomas Jefferson and the absorption of the people in the gaining of wealth and the spending of wealth . The result was a condition of unpreparedness far In excess of that in any European country . " The bottom reason for it seems to me to be that our men were led to think the way the women told them . I consider prohibition one phase of effeminization . It Is law raking on the feminine plan . If I were a woman , though . I think I would support prohibition , particularly if I had a drunken husband . Nevertheless , prohibtion is an example of feminization of thought , and ti 's kind of feminization is invading every department of our national life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the ' catiee. rf the eownfell of all fOrmer civilizations ? ' " , atejeteeele , Babylon , Egypt , Carthage and Rome all fell because they were conquered by poor but hardy races or tribes , " the Admiral said . " All were ruined by unpreparedness . Nineveh and Carthage were literally wiped off the face of the earth ; Rome and Babylon were destroyed , although not wholly , and Egypt was conquered by poor but virile races . This proves that it is the duty of every country to keep itself prepared for war all the time . " In my book , ' The Art of Fighting . ' I point out that the high civilizations of all the great ancient nations followed a series of successful wars . The whole history of the world seems to demonstrate that the great careers of all the great nations have been brought about by a skillful cultivation of , first , the arts of peace and , second , of the arts of war , wherewith to guard the fruits of the arts of peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , do you propose in order to arrest effeminizatlon ? " " There is no remedy as far as I can see , " replied Admiral Fiske . " Nothing can be done , or if it can I do n't know what it is . " " Do you think that an educational campaign would have some beneficial effect ? " Admiral Fiske laughed . " The children and even the students in the universities are being educated in exactly the opposite direction already . Modern education Is mainly along pacifist lines . " Then the Admiral was asked what country he considered the most intelligent . " Germany . especially In all matters relating to war ; and war , after all , is the great ' show down ' , " he said . " Why , look at their navy in the great war ! It was actually better than even the British Navy , and Lord Beatty admitted it himself . - Not only were the German ships the better , but German training was better and their guns were better , their marksmanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all better . And all the allied armies fought against Germany using the very principles of strategy taught by the Germans themselves . Certainly the Germans are the most intelligent people in e world . " " The French are generally considered ' to be the most quick-witted , " it was suggested . " The most quick-witted. yes ; but they lack the mental and physical industry of the Germans . " " In your address you alluded to America 's enormous wealth . Do you consider I that wealth has a dangerous influence on nations or on individuals or on both ? " " I do not think that great wealth is an evil , but I do think that it carries with it great dangers , " said Admiral Fiske . " The chief of these dangers is indolence of all kinds and the next is a mental softness and an aversion to war . Wealthy nations and wealthy persons , are usually conservative , for they have I nothing to gain and everything to lose by war . Now , Germany had a tremendous amount to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States had not gone inV the war . " " But what about the influence of money on individuals ? " 1 " I believe that women are more susceptible to enervation by wealth than I men and more likely to become pampered and luxurious . " was the reply . " Do you disapprove of the existence of a leisure class ? " " I do not consider the existence of a leisure class an evil any more than I consider great wealth an evil ; but in both cases I think there are elements of danger . " 1 " What seems to haVe been the general attitude of the press toward your ad dress ? " I asked . " The substance of my address has been approved by some newspapers . but bitterly condemned by others . The condemnatory words most frequently used have been ' jingoistic ' and " unchristian . ' Yet , what was there jingoistic or unchristian in what I said ? I advocated nothing aggressive or unkind . I merely urged that the nation should employ methods to guard its wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by every city to guard its wealth and protect its citizens . " Admiral Fiske 's parting words were a repetition of his assurance that he saw no remedy  --  none whatever  --  for the modern efferninization of certain nations . ?
