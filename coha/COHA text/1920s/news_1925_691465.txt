txt The resignation of the Rev. Dr. Cornelius Woelfkin , pastor of the Park Avenue Baptist Church . Park Avenue and Sixtyfourth Street , which is attended by the Rockefeller family , was announced yesterday in a letter to the officers and members of the congregation which Dr. Woelfkin read from the pulpit after the morning sermon . It is to take effect on Jan. 12. 1926 . His resignation will be formally presented to the directors of the Church at their regular monthly ineetilIF Friday , May 22 . It was said last night that nothing had been done toward naming Dr. Woelfkin 's successor . The Rev. Eugene C. Carder is associate pastor of the church . It has been reported that the successor of Dr. Woelfkin will be the Rev. Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick , professor in Union Theological Seminary and late the associate minister , although a Baptist . of the First Presbyterian Church . Dr. Fosdick is going abroad in August to be gone for six months on a Sabbatical leave . The First Presbyterian Church is planning to send a committee to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beginning May 21. next , to petition that body to permit Dr , Fosdick to return as permanent special preacher . But the Fundamentalists will be so strong at the Assembly there seems small chance that the Assembly will grant the request . Since Dr. Fosdick is a Baptist and the Park Avenue Church is known as one of the most liberal of that denomination , there has been an undercurrent of talk for some time that Dr. Fosdick would go there . There has also been talk that he might go to Plymouth Church , Brooklyn , to succeed the Rev. Dr. Newell Dwight Hillis . Dr. Woelfkin 's letter of resignation follows : NEW - Forts . May 10 , 1925 . To Ike Officers and Members of the Park Avenue Baptist Church : Dear Friends and Fellow Workers : Forty years is a long period of time out of the average lifetime . Et-en though our days may reach the forescore mark if these years be taken out of the heart of them they major the principal part of one 's active career . Tim sun is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a minister in the Church of Christ , and the twilight hour of that enlistment is but a few months away . Over these years there has rested the abiding benediction of God , beneath them have been the Everlasting Arms , goodness and mercy have been the reward , while divine grace and loving kindness have sustained by commission . I have enjoyed forty years of steadfast labor uninterrupted by serious illness or other causes . Praises Wife 's Service . In all this campaign with . its changes , crises and serious responsibilities , I have had a steadfast , loyal coworker , who has been my ' partner in the fullest sense . Beside being to me a counselor and source of inspiration , she has not spared herself in the service of the Master .. I bear testimony that she has made her voluntarily assumed duties the first consideration of her interest , strength and energy . She has given unstinted and often sacrificial labors to the church during all these years . Together we have anticipated a time when we should lay down the responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the residue of our days to such work as becomes our riper years and for which the experience of the past has prepared us . We have been summoned to make changes before , each ' step carrying us forward in the ministry . This time , - however , we do not look forward to another church charge , but we ' do anticipate some form of ministry which will be broader rather than narrower , and in fields where hitherto we have only made excursions because the church obligations had the first claim . We have no desire to shirk responsibility or evade duty . We hope to work to the last day of ability and strength and fall with our faces toward the day , greeting the unseen with a cheer . I began my career as a preacher in the Emmanuel Baptist Church in Suffolk Street in this city . That church was the outgrowth of your earliest mission under the ministry- . of Dr. Thomas Armitage . Its church building was erected through the generosity of one of your members ( Mr. J. A. Bostwick ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortieth year of my ministry in the home church which indirectly started me upon my career . It is also a very peculiar satisfaction to me to have my last pastorate In this my native city . Like Paul , I can boast I am a citizen of no mean city . To return after a few years ' absence to the home where I attended the public schools , become the recipient of some academic honors , to serve upon the council and board of directors of institutions of learning and be affiliated with other enterprises of civil welfare is more than enough to content a single soul . You gave me the opportunity of sbrving here in the field of religious inspiration , for which I am profoundly grateful . Thirteen years have I served in the fellowship and cooperation of this church . The personnel of our membership has changed very materially during this time . Some of our number have passed beyond the veil and others have gone from us to other churches in other cities . Many have come to us by church letters and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those removed . This is not the place to refer to those experiences which admit of no computations , namely our fellowships in joy and sorrow . They must remain written on the unseen tablets of memory and affection . For some years the church was faced with the problem of leaving an old location with its revered associations . Any change in a city like ours is a venture attended with many risks . After exhausting a number of plans we undertook and completed the beautiful and commodious church building in which we now worship . Though the cost of its erection was more than double the amount estimated at the time of our undertaking we were enabled to dedicate it without financial encumbrances . We have carried our enlarged budget of expenses without deficit and conserved and increased our trust funds giving us a marginal annual income insuring elasticity in our work . The church 's gifts to missionary and philanthropic causes have also largely advanced . I acknowledge the manifold kindnesses which I have received at your hands . I appreciate the cooperation which you have given me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recognize with deep gratitude the time . wisdom , thought and work which the Building Committee has given to our project , which has not only taken responsibility from me but has achieved results for which I had , neither genius nor ability . My thanks are due to all the officers and Members who have made my work among you a genuine pleasure . Yields to Younger Men . I am convinced that the future interests and serviceableness of the church will be best conserved and promoted if its opportunities are visualized through younger eyes and its affairs guided by a younger spirit . It is " the young men who see the visions and they that do know their God do exploits . " I am now constrained to return to you the trust with which you honored me . We shall treasure the recollec-. tion of our happy associations through manifold experience as among the richest assets of our life . We trust that you will reserve a place in your memories and affections for us and - follow us with your prayers and good wishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of His grace which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all them that are sanctified . In best bonds , I am very cordially Yours , CORNELIUS WOELFKIN .
