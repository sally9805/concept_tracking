THERE is something rather pleasantly suggestive in the fashion employed by many of the older writers of inscribing their books from their chambers , or lodging . It gives them at once locality and circumstance . It brings them to our common earth and understanding . Thomas Fuller , for example , having finished his church history of Great Britain , addressed his reader in a preface from his chambers in Sion College . " May God alone have the glory , " he writes , " and the ingenious reader the benefit , of my endeavors ! which is the hearty desire of Thy servant in Jesus Christ , Thomas Fuller . " One pictures a room in the Tudor style , with oak wainscot and tall mullioned windows and leaded glass , a deep fireplace , and black beams above . Outside , perhaps , is the green quadrangle of the college , cloistered within ancient buildings , with gay wall-flowers against the sober stones . Bells answer from tower to belfry in agreeable dispute upon the hour . They were cast in a quieter time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a dedication from such a place might turn the most careless reader into scholarship . In the seat of its leaded windows even the quirk of a Latin sentence might find a meaning . Here would be a room in which to meditate on the worthies of old England , or read a chronicle of forgotten kings ; queens and protesting lovers that have faded into night . Here we see Thomas Fuller dip his quill and make a start . " I have sometimes solitarily pleased myself , " he writes , and he gazes into the dark shadows of the room , seeing , as it were , the pleasant specters of the past . Bishops of Great Britain , long dead , in stole and miter , forgetful of their solemn office , dance in the firelight on his walls . Popes move in dim review across his studies and shake a ghostly finger at his heresy . The past is not a prude . To her lover she reveals her beauty . And the scholar 's lamp is her marriage torch . Nor need it entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elope thus in country fashion to the peaceful waters of the Cam , with its fringe of trees and sunny meadow ; did not possess even a Gothic tower and cloister . It was built on the site of an ancient priory , Elsinge Spital , with almshouses attached , a Jesuit library , and a college for the clergy . It was right in London , down near the Roman wall , in the heart of the tangle traffic , and street cries kept breaking in ? muffins , perhaps , and hot , spiced gingerbread and broken glass . I hope , at least , that the good gentleman 's rooms were up above , somewhat out of the clatter , where muffins - had lost their shrillness . Gingerbread , when distance has reduced it to a pleasant tune , is not inclined to , rouse a scholar from his meditation , and even broken glass is blunted on a journey to a garret . I hope that the old gentleman climbed three flights or more , and that a range of chimney-pots was his outlook and speculation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a book by knowing the circumstance of its composition . Not only would we know the complexion of a man , whether he " be a black or a fair man , " as Addison suggests , " of a mild or choleric disposition , married or a bachelor , " but also in what posture he  |p466  works and what objects meet his eyes when he squares his elbows and dips his pen . We are concerned whether sunlight falls upon his papers or whether he writes in shadow . Also , if an author 's desk stands at a window , we are curious whether it looks on a street or on a garden or whether it squints blindly against a wall . A view across distant hills surely sweetens the imagination , whereas the clatter of the city gives a shrewder twist to fancy . And household matters are of proper concern . We should like to be informed whether an author works in the swirl of the common sitting-room . If he writes within earshot of the kitchen , we should know it . There has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as against an open fire , and whether a plot keeps up its giddy pace upon a sweeping day . Histories have balked before a household interruption . Novels have been checked by the rattle of a careless broom . A smoky chimney has choked the sturdiest invention . If a plot goes slack , perhaps it is a bursted pipe . An incessant grocer 's boy , unanswered on the back porch , has often foiled the wicked earl in his attempts against the beautiful Pomona . Little did you think , my dear madam , as you read your latest novel , that on the very instant when the heroine , Mrs. Elmira Jones , deserted her babies to follow her conscience and become a movie actress , that on that very instant when she slammed the street door , the plumber ( the author 's plumber ) came in to test the radiator . Mrs. Jones nearly took her death on the steps as she waited for the plot to deal with her . Even a marquis now and then , one of the older sort in wig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ashes have needed attention , on his knees before the Lady Emily , begging her to name the happy day . Was it not Coleridge 's cow that calved while he was writing " Kubla Khan " ? In burst the housemaid with ' the joyful news . And that man from Porlock , mentioned in his letters , who came on business ? Did he not despoil the morning of its poetry ? Did Wordsworth 's pigs ? surely he owned pigs ? never get into his neighbor 's garden and need quick attention ? Martin Luther threw his ink-pot , supposedly , at the devil . Is it not more likely that it was at Annie , who came to dust ? Thackeray is said to have written largely at his club , the Garrick or the Athenmum . There was a general stir of feet and voices , but it was foreign and did not plague him . A tinkle of glasses in the distance , he confessed , was soothing , like a waterfall . Steele makes no complaint against his wife Prue , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very first paper of the " Tatler " he gratifies our natural curiosity by naming the several coffeehouses where he intends to compose his thoughts . " Foreign and domestic news , " he says , " you will have from St. James Coffee House . " Learning will proceed from the Grecian . But " all accounts of gallantry , pleasure , and entertainment shall be under the article of White 's Chocolate House . " In the month of September , 1705 , he continues , " a gentleman was washing his teeth at a tavern window in Pall Mall when a fine equipage passed by , and on it , a young lady who looked at him . Away goes the coach ? " Away goes the beauty , with an alluring smile ? rather an ambiguous smile , I ' m afraid ? across her silken shoulder . But for the continuation of this pleasant scandal ( you may be sure that the pretty fellow was quite distracted from his teeth ) one must turn up the yellow pages of the " Tatler . " We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandbox , and took a table in one of White 's forward windows . He wished no garden view or brick wall against the window . We may even go so far as to assume that something in the way of punch , canary , or negus luke , my dear , was handy at his elbow . His paragraphs are punctuated by the gay procession of the street . Here goes a great dandy in red heels , with lace at his beard and wrists . Here is a scarlet captain who has served with Marlborough and has taken a whole regiment of Frenchmen by the nose . Here is the Lady Belinda in her chariot , who is the pledge of all the wits and poets . That little pink ear of hers has been rhymed in a hundred sonnets ? ear and tear and fear and near and dear . The king has been toasted from her slipper . The pretty creature has been  |p467  sitting at ombre for most of the night , but now at four of the afternoon she takes the air with her lap-dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts between shop and shop . She is attended by a female dragon , but contrives by accident to show an inch or so of charming stocking at the curb . Steele , at his window , I ' m afraid , forgets for the moment his darling Prue and his promise to be done . There is something rather pleasant in knowing where these old authors , who are now almost forgotten , wrote their books . Richardson wrote " Clarissa " at Parson 's Green . That ought not to interest us very much , for nobody reads " Clarissa " now . But we can picture the fat little printer reading his daily batch of tender letters from young ladies , begging him to reform the wicked Lovelace and turn the novel to a happy end . For it was issued in parts , and so , of course , there was no chance for young ladies , however impatient , to thumb the back pages for the plot . Richardson wrote " Pamela " at a house called the Grange , in the open country just out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a grotto ? one of the grottoes that had been the fashion for prosperous literary gentlemen since Pope had built himself one at Twickenham . Here , it is said , Richardson used to read his story day by day , as it was freshly composed , to a circle of his feminine admirers . Hugh Thomson has drawn the picture in delightful silhouette . The ladies listen in suspense , ? perhaps the wicked master is just taking Pamela on his knee , their hands are raised in protest . La ! the monster ! Their noses are pitched up to a high excitement . One old lady hangs her head and blushes at the outrage . Or does she cock her head to hear the better ? Richardson had a kind of rockinghorse in his study , and he took his exercise so between chapters . We may imagine him galloping furiously on the hearth-rug , then , quite refreshed , after four or five dishes of tea , hiding his villain once more under Pamela 's bed . Did it never occur to that young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least he has come popping out after she has loosed her stays , once even when she has got her stockings off . Perhaps this is the dangerous moment when the old lady in the silhouette hung her head and blushed . If Pamela had gone rummaging vigorously with a poker beneath her bed she could have cooled her lover . Goldsmith wrote his books for the most part in lodgings . We find him starving with the beggars in Axe Lane , advancing to Green Arbour Court , ? sending down to the cook-shop for a tart to make his supper , ? living in the Temple , as his fortunes mended . Was it not at his window in the Temple that he wrote part of his " A History of the Earth and Animated Nature " ? His first chapter ? four pages ? is called a sketch of the universe . In four pages he cleared the beginning up to Adam . Could anything be simpler or easier ? The clever fellow , no doubt , could have made the universe ? actually made it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea ? in less than the allotted six days and not needed a rest upon the seventh . Goldsmith had nothing in particular outside of his window to look at but the stone flagging , a pump , and a solitary tree . Of the whole green earth this was the only living thing . For a brief season a bird or two lodged there , and you may be sure that Goldsmith put the remnant of his crumbs upon the window casement . Perhaps it was here that he sent down to the cook-shop for a tart , and he and the birds made a common banquet across the glass . Poets , depending on their circumstance , are supposed to write either in garrets or in gardens . Browning , it is true , lived at Casa Guidi , which was " yellow with sunshine from morning to evening , " and here and there a prosperous Byron has a Persian carpet and mahogany desk . But for the most part we put our poets in garrets as a cheap place that has the additional advantage of being nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown on a windy night. , Rhymes and fancies are roused by gazing on the stars . The rumble of the lower city is potent to start a metaphor . " These fringes of lamp-light , " it is written , " struggling up through smoke and thousandfold exhalation , some fathoms into the ancient reign of Night , what thinks Bootes of  |p468  them , as he leads his Hunting-dogs over the Zenith in their leash of sidereal fire ? That stifled hum of Midnight , when Traffic has lain down to rest . " Here , under a sloping roof , the poet sits , blowing at his fingers . Hogarth has drawn him ? " The Distressed Poet " ? cold and lean and shabby . That famous picture might have been copied from the life of any of a hundred creatures of " The Dunciad , " and with a change of costume it might serve our time as well . The poor fellow sits at a broken table in the dormer . About him lie his scattered sheets . His wife mends his breeches . Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is not a penny in the place , and for food only half a loaf and something brewing in a kettle . You may remember that when Johnson was a young poet , just come to London , he lived with Mr. Cave in St. John 's Gate . When there were visitors he ate his supper behind a screen because he was too shabby to show himself . I wonder what definition he gave the poet in his dictionary . If he wrote in his own experience , he put him down as a poor devil who was always hungry . But Chatterton actually died of starvation in a garret , and those other hundred poets of his time and ours got down to the bone and took to coughing . Perhaps we shall change our minds about that sonnet which we tossed lightly to the moon . The stars travel on such lonely journeys ! The jest loses its relish . Perhaps those merry verses to the Christmas , the sleigh-bells and the roasted goose , perhaps those verses turn bitter when written on an empty stomach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was by way of being a poet , built himself a garden-seat at Moor Park when he served Sir William Temple , but I do n't know that he wrote poetry there . Rather , it was a place for reading . Pope in his prosperous days wrote at Twickenham , with the sound of his artificial waterfall in his ears , and he wAlked to take the air in his grotto along the Thames . But do poets really wander beneath the moon to think their verses ? Do they compose " on summer eve by haunted stream " ? I doubt whether Gray conceived his " Elegy " in an actual graveyard . I smell oil . One need not see the thing described upon the very moment . Shelley wrote of mountains , the awful range of Caucasus , but his eye at the time looked on sunny Italy . Ibsen wrote of the North when living in the South . When Bunyan wrote of the Delectable Mountains he was snug inside a jail . Where did Andrew Marvell stand or sit or walk when he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down a gravel path with his eyes on the ground . I wonder whether the gardener ever broke in ? if he had a gardener ? to complain about the drought or how the dandelions were getting the better of him . Or perhaps the lawn-mower squeaked , if he had a lawn-mower , and threw him off . But was n't it Wordsworth who woke up four times in one night and called to his wife for pens and paper lest an idea escape him ? Surely he did n't take to the garden at that time of night in his pajamas with an ink-pot . But did Wordsworth have a wife ? How one forgets ! Coleridge told Hazlitt that he liked to compose " walking over uneven ground , or breaking through the straggling branches of a copse-wood . " But , then , you recall that a calf broke into " Kubla Khan . " On that particular day , at least , he was safe in his study . No , I think that poets may like to sit in gardens and smoke their pipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes actually to composing they would rather go inside , for even a little breeze scatters their papers . They put their stick on one pile and their pipe on another and they hold down loose sheets with their thumb . But verses are vagrant in the wind . Nor do poets care to suck their pencils too long where some one may see them ; perhaps Annie at the window rolling her pie-crust . And they ca n't kick off their shoes in the hot agony of composition . And also , which caps the argument , a garden is undeniably a sleepy place . The bees drone to a sleepy tune ; the breeze practises a lullaby ; even the sunlight is in the common conspiracy . At the very moment when the poet is considering little Miss Muffet and how she sat on a tuffet , ? doubtless in a garden , for there were spiders , ?  |p469  even at the moment when she sits unsuspectingly at her curds and whey , down goes the poet 's head and he is fast asleep . Sleepiness is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who doubtless was an author in his odd moments , came to the garden and the Arbour on the Hill Difficulty , " he pulled his roll out of his bosom and read to his comfort . . . thus pleasing himself awhile he at last fell into a slumber . " Has it not been written that even the worthy Homer nods ? Is not Shakspere allowed his forty winks ? A pleasing land of drowsyhed it was : Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye ; And of gay castles in the clouds that pass , Forever flushing round the summer sky . No , if one has a bit of writing to put out of the way , it is best to stay indoors . Choose an uncomfortable , straightbacked chair . And if some one will pay the milk-score and keep the window mended , a garret is not a bad place to write . Novelists , unless they have need of history , can write anywhere , I suppose , at home or on a journey . In the burst of their hot imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Hugh Walpole , touring in this country , contrives to write a bit even on a Pullman . The ingenious Mr. Oppenheim surely dashes off a plot on the margin of the menu between meat and salad . We know that " Pickwick Papers " was written partly in hackney-coaches while Dickens was jolting about the town . An essayist , on the other hand , needs a desk and a library near at hand , because an essay is a kind of back-stove cookery . A novel needs a hot fire , so to speak . A dozen chapters bubble in their turn above the reddest coals , while an essay simmers over a little flame . Pieces of this and that , an odd carrot , as it were , a left-over potato , a pithy bone , discarded trifles , are tossed in from time to time to feed the composition . Raw paragraphs , when they have stewed all night , at last become tender to the fork . An essay , therefore , can not be written hurriedly on the knee . Essayists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are large and are always in disorder . There is a stack of books on the clockshelf ; others are pushed under the bed . Matches , pencils , and bits of paper mark a hundred references . When an essayist goes out from his lodging he wears the kind of overcoat that holds a book in every pocket ; his sagging pockets proclaim him . He is a bulging person , so stuffed even in his dress with the ideas of others that his own leanness is concealed . An essayist keeps a notebook and he thumbs it for forgotten thoughts . Nobody is safe from him , for he steals from every one he meets . Like the man in the old poem , he relies on his memory for his wit . An essayist is not a mighty traveler . He does not run to grapple with a roaring lion . He desires neither typhoon nor tempest . He is content in his harbor to listen to the storm upon the rocks , if now and then by a lucky chance he can shelter some one from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . He has glanced upon the thoughts of many men , and as opposite philosophies point upon the truth , he is modest with his own and tolerant of others . He looks at the stars and , knowing in what a dim immensity we travel , he writes of little things beyond dispute . There are enough to weep upon the shadows ; he , like a dial , marks the light . The small clatter of the city beneath his window , the cry of peddlers , children chalking their games upon the pavement , laundry dancing on the roofs , and smoke in the winter 's wind ? these are the things he weaves into the fabric of his thoughts . Or sheep upon the hillside , if his window is so lucky , or a sunny meadow is a profitable speculation . And so , while the novelist is struggling up a dizzy mountain , straining through the tempest to see the kingdoms of the world , behold the essayist , snug at home , content with little sights ! He is a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaps to no great heights , and sees neither the devil nor the seven oceans nor the twelve apostles . He paints old thoughts in shiny varnish and , as he is able , he mends small habits here and there . And therefore , as essayists stay at  |p470  home , they are precise , almost amorous , in the posture and outlook of their writing . Leigh Hunt wished a great library next his study . " But for the study itself , " he writes , ; give me a small snug place , almost entirely walled with books . There should be only one window in it , looking on trees . " How the precious fellow scorns the mountains and the ocean ! He has no love , it seems , for typhoons and roaring lions . " I entrench myself in my books , " he continues , " equally against sorrow and the weather . If the wind comes down the passage , I look about to see how I can fence it off by a better disposition of my movables . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen against cold and trouble . But Leigh Hunt had been in prison for his political beliefs . He had grappled with his lion . So perhaps , after all , my argument fails . Mr. Edmund Gosse had a different method to the same purpose . He " was so anxious to fly all outward noise " that he wished for a library apart from the house . Maybe he had had some experience with Annie and her clattering broomstick . " In my sleep , " he writes , " when dreams are multitude , ' I sometimes fancy that one day I shall have a library in a garden . The phrase seems to contain the whole felicity of man . . . . It sounds like having a castle in Spain , or a sheep-walk in Arcadia . " Montaigne 's study was a tower , walled all about with books . At his table in the midst he was the general focus of their wisdom . Hazlitt wrote much at an inn at Winterslow , with Salisbury Plain around the corner of his view . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seas ( here was the novelist showing itself ) , Stevenson would probably have preferred a windy perch overlooking Edinburgh . It does seem as if rather a richer flavor were given to a book by knowing the circumstance of its composition . Consequently readers , as they grow older , turn more and more to biography . It is not chiefly the biographies that deal with great crises and events , but rather the biographies that are concerned with small circumstance and agreeable gossip . Lately in a book-shop at the foot of Cornhill I fell in with an old scholar who told me that it was his practice to recommend four books , which , taken end on end , furnished the general history of English writing from the Restoration to a time within his own memory . These hooks were Pepys ' " Diary , " Boswell 's " Johnson , " the " Letters and Diaries " of Madame D'Arblay , and the " Diary " of Crabbe Robinson . Beginning almost with the days of Cromwell , here is a chain of pleasant gossip across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first there were old fellows still alive who could remember Shakspere ; who still sat in chimney-corners and babbled through their toothless gums of Blackfriars and the Globe . And at the end we find a reference to President Lincoln and his freeing of the slaves . Here are a hundred authors , perhaps a thousand , tucking up their cuffs , looking out from their familiar windows , scribbling their masterpieces .  |p471
