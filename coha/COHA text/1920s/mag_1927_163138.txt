Cross at crosswords , querulous at questions , the public is now invited to play a game which is allegedly neither elevating nor depressing . It used to be called " Categories , " but was renamed " Guggenheim " to make it more popular or something. * Authorities agree it is a safe game at mixed parties . The chief requirements for play , besides a " Guggenheim " book , are pencils , paper , patiences . <P> The game is to take a word-for example , " crazy " - and try to name sets of well known lunatics , asylums , slang words meaning " crazy , " madhouse apparatus and perhaps a few causes of insanity , each set composed of words beginning with letters in " crazy . " Thus , " c " words in some of the different sets above suggested could be " Caligula , " " cuckoo , " " catnip . " Under " a " could come , " authors of Guggenheim , " " addled , " " amusement books . " <P> The only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games each , plus specialties and " postgraduate " suggestions . The difference in price is due to two other differences . <P> The book by Authors Eames and Marshall appears actually to have been written by them . Miss Eames is a tall , determined younger sister of Actress Clare Eames and writes for the New Yorker . <P> The book by Authors Disney and Mackaye contains only contributions , coaxed from such personages as the presidents of the Lucy Stone League and of the Bush Terminal Co. , Authors W. E. Woodward ( Bunk ) and Irvin Cobb , Professor William Lyon Phelps and David Belasco . Cartoonist Rube Goldberg was allowed to make up one game and , choosing the monosyllable " cdflm , " he included among his categories a " kind of candy " and " something you see in a barn . " This book also contains blank pages for self-sufficient Guggenheimers and people who like to try outguessing themselves . <P> *GUGGENHEIM-Dorothy Disney and Milton Mackaye-A . &; C.
