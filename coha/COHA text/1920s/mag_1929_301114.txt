" He had an intense appreciation of the good things of life ; good wine , good music , were appreciated to the full ; his capacity for enjoyment was not marred by any pangs of doubt as to whether the course he happened to be pursuing was right . It was always right-always inevitable . He once said that he never regretted anything he had done-his only regret was for the opportunities for enjoyment which he had foregone or missed . Above all , he enjoyed the success of his own policy and was rightly proud of the service he had rendered to his country and the great personal position he had achieved . " <P> The great man thus thumbnail-sketched was Gustav Stresemann who died of a form of apoplexy ( TIME , Oct. 14 ) . Thumbnailer : Viscount D'Abernon , patrician first Ambassador of Great Britain to the German Republic , writing in the January issue of Foreign Affairs , scholarly grey-bound U. S. quarterly . Of Stresemann and himself the Viscount writes : " For six years we were in almost daily intercourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions were ever more frank with one another or more free . . . . " <P> Best hater of Stresemann was Clemenceau . Last week Clemenceau was thumb-nailed by the only woman except his daughters to whom he left money ( 100,000 frs : $3,930 ) , his stenographer , Mme. Pernoud . <P> " The morning I was summoned to go to Clemenceau 's home , " said she in Paris , " I was warned above all not to put rouge on my lips , and not to wear high-heeled shoes . ' Clemenceau has a horror of all those things in women , ' I was told . Moreover , I had to use a goose quill pen , because the Tiger always hated the grating of steel pens . I consented to sacrifice these feminine vanities , and went not without trembling to the door of this ' terror of ministers , ' this irascible enemy of governments . <P> " I was received with the utmost cordiality . From the first morning that I worked with Clemenceau I learned of his great heart , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . His grandeur was that of a god , but his simplicity attached him to earth . <P> " People were wrong to say that Clemenceau was an antifeminist . In giving women franchise and social liberty , he did fear the influence on them by the clergy . Accordingly he was against too much power for women in Catholic countries . The Protestant religion he considered more as a philosophy , and he admitted therefore that universal suffrage was feasible in Protestant countries . "
