" We have a Southern democracy , a Western democracy and an Eastern democracy . We have a rural democracy and a labor democracy . We have an agricultural democracy and an industrial democracy . We have a Protestant democracy and a Catholic democracy . <P> " So long as we have all these branches and divisions , we are not a Democratic party at all . " - Senator Copeland , Democrat of New York , at Kansas City , Mo . <P> The U. S. Treasury has been swamped with requests for contributions to help build a Negro Church in Oklahoma , to help a minister trying to make a living in Michigan , to help this worthy cause , to help that worthy person . Why has it been presumed that the Treasury might give away money freely ? Because the last Congress passed a law increasing Congressmen 's salaries from $7,500 to $10,000 a year and some Congressmen talked of refusing the increase . The Comptroller General ruled that they had to take their monthly pay checks at the $10,000 rate , but that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of the 531 Congressmen and Senators , only one has sent back the difference . Every month after the pay checks are sent out , he returns a check for $208.33 . It is a point of honor with him . His father , John Randolph Tucker , onetime Representative , once refused a similar salary increase and had himself especially exempted from taking it in the appropriation bill . So Representative Henry <P> St. George Tucker of Lexington , Va. , gives the Government $208.33 monthly and 530 others do not . <P> <P> At Pikeville , Ky. , a U. S. Representative was arrested on a warrant charging drunkenness . A deputy sheriff who made the arrest said he found the Representative in a downtown building only partially dressed . In court , the Representative called his accuser a liar and , according to the judge , used profanity . So he was sentenced to ten hours in jail and a $10 fine . The jail sentence was reduced to four hours at the request of his wife and physician . <P> He is Representative John W. Langley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a charge of drunkenness . He was convicted , last year , of conspiracy to violate the prohibition law and is under sentence to serve a term in the Atlanta Penitentiary . Another similar charge is pending against him . He was reflected last fall . <P> Subsequently , Mr. Langley was indicted for drunkenness . <P> " I shall go direct to London and consult with my old friend and neighbor of Corning , N. Y. , Mr. Houghton , and shall proceed thence to Berlin without stopping at Paris . " <P> So Dr. Jacob Gould Schurman , onetime ( 1892-1920 ) President of Cornell , onetime ( 1921-25 ) Minister to China , taking ship for his new post in the Embassy at Berlin . <P> " So far , I think that the foreign policy of President Coolidge has been successful ; the settlement with Mexico , the refusal to recognize the Reds of Russia , the settlement of the Isle of Pines question have all added to our standing among the nations . " <P> So Janies W. Gerard , Treasurer of the Democratic National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he returned from Europe . <P> " In the name of God , Amen , " wrote Thomas R. Marshall at the head of a blank piece of white paper . Below he wrote an instrument bequeathing all his worldly goods to his wife , Lois K. Marshall .
