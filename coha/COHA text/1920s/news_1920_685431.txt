txt The Republican National Convention , after two sessions in the Coliseum here today , at one of which it adopted the party platform by an almost unanimous vote , adjourned tonight ready to start nominating speeches for candidates for the Presidency when it reconvenes at 9:30 o'clock tomorrow morning . The morning session was uneventful and that of the afternoon , with the lack of the battle on the floor over the treaty plank which had been threatened , was far from thrilling . Not only was there agreement on the peace plank , but the threats of Irish sympathizers to drag the Sinn Fein issue before the delegates themselves proved empty . So after all there were no fireworks . The final draft of the platform was rem " by Senator Watson of Indiana so hurriedly that it was manifest that the full meaning of the somewhat involved planks on foreign relations was not understood by a majority of the delegates , who contented themselves with indorsing the committee 's action and letting it go at that . A minority report presented by Edwin J. Gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownership and other subjects , was hissed and buried under a landslide of disapproval . Delegates Show Impatience . The Coliseum was an oven when the delegates reconvened for the afternoon session but the extreme heat deterred no one from being on hand . The place was jammed . Virtually every one wielded a fan and the disposition to dispense with superfluous garments was general . There were the usual conferences between little groups standing in the aisles or leaning over the backs of other men 's chairs , but there was no particular air of tension . Most of those who talked together were smiling in the intervals of mopping moist faces and sticky hands . The weather and the League of Nations seemed to be topics of about equal interest , and for the first time there appeared to be a touch of that spirit which old politicians dread  --  the feeling born of heat and weariness , of " Oh , let 's nominate some one and go home . " One could hear many ; inquiries as to how soon it would be over and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they would finish the business In short order and depart . " Uncle Joe " Cannon , who fled on Wednesday while the delegates were yelling for a speech from him , came back this afternoon just as the band struck up one of its first noisy tunes . He slipped quietly into his seat almost unnoticed amid the horde of voluble men and women on all sides , many of them persons bearing conspicuous names . Music 's Charms Fall . By 4 o'clock there was scarcely a vacant chair discernible in delegate territory . A man sang a solo up in the bandstand , but could n't compete with the general conversation . Then the band struck up " Dixie . " The conversation buzzed right along and despite the fact that in the war Americans schooled themselves to stand up for almost anything , nobody arose , and nobody applauded . Even the negroes  --  proud and happy survivors of Southern delegate contests  --  were too busy seeing and being seen to bother about the music . By the time the delegates were all on hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League of Nations had got pretty well out to the country . One might have imagined that in consequence the men gathered to ' adopt the platform and choose the Presidential candidate were beginning to hear from the folios at home , for all through the region of State standards a swarm of messengers were scurrying about , handing their yellow envelopes to delegate after delegate . Cries of " let 's go , " applause and catcalls showed how the packed crowd was suffering and the eagerness to get it over with . Senator Lodge appeared at 4:40 o'clock and obtained silence with three light raps . Naming the National Committee . " The Chairman directs that the See-. retary call the roll for nominations for ? " said the Chairman , and there was a gasp and a thrill until ho finished ? " members of the ' National Committee . " The first real spontaneous ovation came a moment later when Illinois presented the name of Lawrence Y. Sherman as its choice for National Commiteeman . Hundreds of delegates jumped to their feet and there was a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first hisses of the convention when Henry Lincoln Johnson was nominated by a part of the Georgia delegation as National Committeeman of his State . Another part of the delegation wanted Henry S. Jackson , the present committeemen . Hisses met the name of Johnson , who retained his seat as one of Georgia 's " big four " only after a hard fight before the Credentials Committee . Senator Lodge ruled that any controversies must be settled after the roll call . Alabama retained Oliver D. Street , Arizona Alien B. Jaynes , and Arkansas H. L. Remmel . California , whose presort representative on the committee is William H. Crocker , one of Senator Hiram Johnson 's chief supporters , was passed without making its choice known . Connecticut announced for Roorback , Delaware for T. Coleman du Pont , and Florida for George W. Bean . Among the more conspicuous changes in the makeup of the committee which became apparent were these : Keating replaced James H. Hemenway for . Indiana , Garrett got Alfred J. Sweet 's place for Maine and Weeks displaced W. Murray Crape for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hines to replace Herbert Parsons , its present National CommitteeMan . Jake L. Harmon replaced James J. for Oklahoma . Ernest Bamberg , er displaced Senator Reed Smoot as Utah 's representative , There was a re-echo of the campaign fund testimony before the Senate investigating committee when Missouri announced that it had retained Jacob L. Babler es National Committeeman . It was Babler who handled the money which reached two Lowden delegates . A little group of Western delegates across the aisle from the Missouri delegation hissed roundly at the mention of Babler 's name . Pennsylvania tried to duplicate the demonstration which Illinois got with Sherman 's name when it announced that it had rechosen Boles Penrose . The members of the delegation jumped to their feet and cheered and yelled , waving to others to join then , but could not start a real demonstration . Vote to Cut Seconding Speeches . The Chairman then recognized Charles D. Hines of New York , who moved suspension of the rules to allow two seconding ' speeches of five minutes each for each candidate and in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes per speech . Seconded by Minnesota and North Carolina the proposal Wa ? adopt , ed over a barrage ' of ha " noes . " Then Senator Lodge drew forth a wave of protest by announcing that the report of the Committee bit Resolutions could not be expected for another hour . Lee house rang with shouts of dissatisfaction , but Senator Lodge stilled them with his gavel and added : " I have just been informed by the kindness of the press that the Resolutions Committee has finished its work and is just leaving for the Coliseum . " There were cheers and then a multitude of calls for " Uncle Joe " Cannon . After consultations on the platform , Senator Lodge announced that Mr. Cannon had a violent headache and begged to be excused . He was stilt speaking when there was a commotion behind him and Mr. Lode remarked : " But he is coming anyway . " Uncle Joe " Makes a Seieech . Mr. Cannon came slowly down to the Part of the " gangplank ' where the speakers hold forth . with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have heard , " he said , " that the Eighteenth Amendment , the prohibition amendment , has been ratified . All Our laws are erected under the Constitution and water . In it I drink the health of the speakers and the delegates . " He recalled his appearance on the pletform with Chauncey M. Depew four years ago , and then made a reference to the long list of Republican conven- , tions he had attended . From this he proceeded to a disquisition on the office of President . " I am not going to criticise Wilson , for in the presence of Republicans it is not necessary , " he said . ? ' We 've got a good many candidates now , and 1 do n't know who 's going - to be nominated , but whoever is nominated I hope and believe will be a great success . " Then Mr. Cartoon referred to the civil war and the resumption of specie payments . Tho crowd was by now only politely interested , but " Uncle Joe " at any rate commanded their attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his face red above his gray beard , he talked with the ease of an old campaigner about the taxes that would have to be paid In the coming years to meet the war debt and made it seem that it was coming to be not only a pleasure but a positive luxury to demonstrate that this generation can throw off the load of war costs as well as its ancestors . The crowd liked " Uncle Joe , " but It was loo hot to applaud even such timehonored themes as the valor of the men who saved the Union , or the name of George Washington , so he turned to discussing ' the platform . " I have n't seen it , " he said , " but I hope and believe that when it is presented every delegate here will approve it . ( Cheers ) . Mr. Chairman , is n't that committee almost here ? " Shouts Rebuke Song Leader . But the committee was not ready , so Mr. Cannon came back for a few words more , leading up to " goodby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was an awkward pause . The band filled it in with a Sousa march , but when the music ended there was still nothing before the House . The missing committee was still miesing . All over the hall spectators began to shout for other favorite apealcers , hut ae there was no general demand the names were lost in an indistinguishable confusion of cries . Once more the band saved the occasion . But cries for speakers , among which the name of exSenator Beveridge gradually began to prevail , drowned the band . There was only one hope left . Albert Brown , the " pepy " cheer leader , who had injected ginger into the convention on the first two days , came forward and oohed the crowd to join him in singing " The Long , Long Trail . " There was a howl that ' rocked the girders . It rose into a plateau of raucous sound that lingered up under the roof as Brown and the band and some conscientious delegates tried to sing . They kept on yelling as if somebody had mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an inandiide gavel . Brown went through the motions of singing " The Long . Long Trail . " Timidly , but with growing power , sonic of the crowd joined in , but whenever the song became audible the tempest of howls rose again ; Meanwhile , a disregarded band was playing " Hail , Hail , the Gang 's All Here . " Brown finally threw up his hands in surrender and backed away . The yelling stopped . He eame forward again and the protest began again . Neither Brown nor the band could divert it . The crowd had not come for a song service . Brown made a strategic withdrawal , and the crowd , after a cheer of victory , decided to uphold its musical reputation by starting a song of its own . That song was " How Dry I Am , " and it came from the heart . In a moment it had spread all over the house like Spanish influenza . Even William Jennings Bryan , present as a reporter , wore a forgiving smile . The hand was encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and managed to elia back into mild favor with " In the Good Old Summertime " and " There 'll lie a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight . " Johnson Wins Georgia Fight . Reverting to the Georgia contest , the Secretary called the roll of the delegation when the singing died away , to determine the State 's national committee.mau . There was laughter and applause as one dusky delegate after the other voted for Henry Lincoln Johnson , who had proved to bo such an able advocate for himself and his colleagues when the Credentials Committee showed a disposition to reverse the national committee and oust them . Johnson was elected National Committeeman by a big majority . He is a burly , eloquent . self-confident negro and is a Lowden supporter . When Senator Lodge asked if the convention woudl accept him , there were many " noes , " but Mr. Lodge declared him elected . There were protests from the floor , and the Chairman announced that the delegates could suspend the rules by a two-third vote and have a roll call en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , and there was just a bit more wrangling . Then Senator Ledge announced that he had been informed it Was mandatory that no further action be taken after the delegation had voted and the matter had been placed before the convention . That ended the argument , and- Johnson became Georgia 's National Committeeman . After that there was a long lug whit . ' the band played listleseiy . Miserably hot delegates gathered in the aisles and climbed on top of their chairs , apparently under a mistaken notion that cool air rises . Mayor William Hale Thompson 's Fire and Police Departments , while the convention was waiting for the resolutions report closed all doors to the Coliseum and ordered that no : me should he allowed to enter except delegate : ; and alternates . As a reeult many ticketholders were excluded and . newspaper men whose business took them in and out found themselves hampered arid impeded . R'atson Reeds t be Platform . Senator James E. Wetanll of Indiana appeared beside Senator Lodge at it : ea o'clock and the ellail'Inan announced that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates cheered and scurried to their seats . There was almost perfect silence as the Senator began . He was interrupted by perfunctory applause at mentioning the party 's loyalty to the Constitution and determination to uphold the melon 's ideals . . As he read on , the comments on set-en years of Democratic rule with tiee charge of complete unpreparedness for war or peace got a light flurry of applause despite the Senator 's requeet that he he not interrupted . The demand for a return to a peace-time basis brought a slight stir of appros-al , but by that time the delegates evidently had made up their minds to obey the request not to applaud , and there was no noise . The fling at the unabridgment of wartime powers after the armistice followed . The Senator read the party 's pledge to and " executive autocracy " and " restore constitutional Government " to the people and got the first cheer . Tile charge that the President 's " vindictive vetoes " had nullified a great part of constructive Republican legislation was received In silence ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike to President Wilson for his delay in appointing the Railway Labor Board . There was little sign of enthusiasm for the recitation of the party 's achievement in raising the pay of postal employes . The submission of the woman suffrage amendment and its ratification by the States which have acted thus far brought a shower of handclaps , mostly from the women on the floor and In the galleries . " The farmer is the backbone of the nation , " read Senator Watson and the rural delegates eat up in their chairs . The recommendations for solution of the farmer 's troubles followed . Cheer Declaration oh Strikes . Coming to industrial relations Senator Watson presented the expression of belief in co-partnership between capital and labor , with the justice of collective bargaining . Then came the declaration that strikes should be limited and reduced in number by proper legislation . " We deny the right to strike against the Government , " reed Senator Watson and everybody cheered , just as they had done a moment before when it appeared that a tribunal was recommended to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compulsory arbitration was ruled out by the report , which set the delegates to wondering whether this virtual ( heapKoval of time Kansas industrial court idea meant the end of Governor Allen of that State as a dark horse . The rigid economy pledge did not seem to provoke special interest . By the time it was heard Senator Watson had been reading for nearly twenty minutes and every one wee becoming impatient for the crux of the whole business  --  the treaty plank . There was a great cheer for the charge of " intolerable usurpation " levelled against the President . Taxation which ? a$ declared to mulct the consumer inel hinder industry was condemned in the disappointed silence which ensued when it appeared that the pettrpation charge was not to be followed at once by the treaty plank . Senator Watson reed rapidly over ' the financial plonks , winning applause at the declaration that there was " no short way out " and that the party would not s0ck to deceive the people bypromises it could not fulfill . Approve Federal Ownership Stand . The profiteering planks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar of approval for the declaration against Government ownership . Reaffirmation of belief in the protective tariff principle and the pledge of tariff revision as soon us possible , erthodox G. 0 . P. , doctrine , was welcomed The merchant marine plank was heard apathetically until the recommendation for the free . passage through the Panama Canal of American ships was reached . when there was more cheering . The immigration tilt:trine gone next and the restrictions suggested against undesirables , both in this country and at the source , were acclaimed by both delegates and spectators . The National League of Women Vetere ' plank for independent citizenship for Women won a Warn ) . reception from the feminine contingent . Half the delegates jumped to their feet and New York led In a rousing cheer at the pronouncement against agitation for tile destruction of the Government . For the first time the delegates waved the ! ; straw Irate awl the women fluttered their handkerchiefs . ' 1'lle delegates liked the anti-lynching Tribute to Roosevelt 's Nemo . The mention of Theodore Roosevelt 's name in connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tributts which they voiced with a will . So on down the list read the , committee chairman , but the delegates were wriggling and squirming end fanning . For the first time in the midst of a session empty seats were-discernible here and there In the sections reserved for spectators and there was a steady though quiet drift toward the exit . Foreign relations . " read Senator Watson at last and at once every one sat up end new tenseness was felt . A big chee cattle with the assertion that . the , rights of American citizens should be upheld while the nation should scrupulously regard the rights of others . ' 1'lle language in which the President 's Mexiteip policy was attacked , heightened by SerottOr Watson 's rise of a voice well adapted to invective and sarcasm , drew another noisy demonstration , but still everyone was waiting for the treaty plank , and waiting ever more inntienti y . This became particulerly evident when the Senator read the word " Armenia " which evoked loud laughter even before the delegates had heard the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Tenco Interest in Peace Plank . The long-awaited plank came at last . Leaeue of Nations , " read the Senator , with the effect of adininietering an electric shock to the faded gathering . ' The Republican Part ? , " hi ! continued , " elands for agreement among the nations to ? preserve the peace of the world . " There was a moderate outburst of cheering , followed by cries of " Right " and " Good ! " ' when there came the declaration of belief that all this eould be accomplistrod Without deprivingthe linited States el ' its hidependilice and Without involving it sur a partielpent , not es a peace-maker , In a multitude of quarrels . Condemnation of the covenant brought back by the President went well with the temper of the listeners . Defense of the Senate for its course trod attacks on the President for his insistence upon his plena were just as welcome . Finally , time Senator , In his reeding. came to the assureande that this nation , under Republican guidance , would negotiate with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure the fulfillment of America 's internationel obligations without the-surrendering of American rights and principles . Ile was heard with almost dramatic interest , but he reel rapidly , and it is doubtful if a tenth of the delegates were able to gather the complete meanIn the vicinity et the platform , where the eorreFpondeats eat at each side of the speaker 's dais , the crowds , both of delegates and spectators . were buzzing with questions as to precisely what the party 's international position was as defined by the plank . It was perfectly manifest that all factions had been linrmonized to such a degree that the delegates were perfectly willing to leave the whole league and treaty question to the Resolutions Committee and to accept whatever solution that ' committee reached . Minority Report Missed . The end of Senator Watson 's reading was received with prolonged applause , which appeared to express the satisfaction of everybody at the prospect of getting through and getting away without fighting . The order was Senator Watson 's motion to adopt the platform , be : there were still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minority objectors to be dealt with , even though the major issue had been settled in committee . First to be heard was Edwin J. Gross , a delegate at large from Wisconsin , who offered a minority report representing the La Follette ? views , as he did four years ago . The crowd did not want minority reports . Grose was received with hisses and hoots , which grew in volume , until Chairman Lodge pounded the table and declared that Gross had as good a right to a hearing as anybody else in the convention . So the Wisconsin man began a statement of the familiar principles of the La Follette group . There were a few cheers when he . denounced tile treaty es a betrayal of the world , calling for " a real league of ell the nations . ' A somewhat heeler demnonstration followed when he apc ! ii of Ireland . When lie demanded ' ' the restoration of American liberties . " anal added , " and that applies to ? aerie of you here , " there Was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only an appetizer for the chorus of roars of " no " mingled with cat-calls and hisses which burst eta when Gross ' demanded Government ownership not only of railroads hut also of stockyards mid similar enterprises . The Chairman hail to intervene twice , the second time reminding the epectatortt that they were there as guests , and threatening to clear the galleries " if any interference is caused with the business of the convention . " Counter Oltar ; te4 nt Inonit , Gross took a moment at the end of his platform for a talk about tine League of Nations . " We have a right . to know , " he said , " If the Republican Party is against the League or not , and we might es well know it now . " Ile assured the crowd that there were thousands of people outside the hall who agreed with his platform , " even If I have been subjected to sonic insult . " There was a roar of response , " Yes , the Socialists , " varied by cries of " You insulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his report for that of the majority got a few scattered " Y fl:15 , " in - eluding eluding one extraordinarily loud ' one from Wisconsin . But the " Nays ' ' drowned it . Then Senator Lodge put the question of the adoption of the majority report , but was interrupted by Meal ' de rifest of Illinois , with a. motion to put in a . plank reducing the representation of States which dep  --  iVe negrOeS Of votes - in violation of the Constitution .
