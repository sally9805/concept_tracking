NOW , when I decided to go from Marrakech to Fez , Djilali said to me , " Fez is a wicked city . The streets are dark and narrow . Rivers rush under them . The man who sees you are a stranger and a Christian will invite you to his house with magic words . In his house he will rob you . Then he will cut your head from your body ; and he will drop your head through a hole into one river , and your body through a hole into another river ; and your head and your body will be separate in the plain where the rivers come out from under the city . They will be naked . " Therefore , when I departed from Marrakech on my way to Fez I did not know what lay before me unless it were risk and danger ; and without Djilali , who had been my safe friend , I was alone . I had chosen the way by Safi and the sea ; and in the motor wagon with a dozen Arabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak their language except to say , " Thank you . There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is the Messenger of Allah . " It was still early morning ; the sun was brilliant and the shadows long . Swiftly we pulled up from the plain in the midst of which is Marrakech . Great hills stepped in behind us. hiding from my backward look the city and its groves and even the snow of the High Atlas , which no mere distance ever darkened . In the curves of the road we stopped abruptly to spare the Berber shepherd and his flock ; and in the straightaway we often halted while the nomad cursed his superb camel into passing us . Then we wereon a plateau . On either side of the road , as far as the eye could see , the land was furrowed cinnamon and brown . Camel and donkey , hitched to the same plow , walked disdainfully up and down the fields , pulling the share some son of Adam guided . Far off to the west , under white clouds , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought Safi , which is on the sea , was no farther than across the fields in view . But it was a long way . In midmorning we stopped at a little white roadhouse , where we got down to stretch our legs ; and one of the Arabs , who was well dressed , took my arm and led me into the roadhouse to buy me coffee . Then we sped on again through the cool wind , till the plateau broke down before us , and we coasted and twisted into a sterile valley where there was no longer water in the river bed and the windless air was hot . Having gone down into the valley , we must climb up in low speed on the farther side , and cross a ridge ; when we came truly to the sight of the sea , which was blue as flax with not a ship on it , and to Safi , and my hotel on the hills above it In the evening I descended into the town . As I passed a caf ? a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little table sat the Arab who had bought me coffee on the way . With him sat a young Arab . Together they invited me to drink coffee . The young man 's name was Mohammed el Barka ; and as he spoke a little French , we were able to converse over the coffee . Upon my telling him I was an American , he lifted the edge of my coat and was disappointed to discover I carried no revolver in my hip pocket . For he had seen the moving pictures , young Mohammed , and knew my country as we show it to the world . Yet for all I failed to conform to type , he liked me none the less ; and with that immediate friendliness , which takes no stock of intimacy or length of acquaintance and which is natural to his intuitive race , he urged me to stay over a day or two in Safi so that he might be my host and guide . Towards noon of the next day , after we had been wandering through the little town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I knew it we were up a flight of stairs and in an Arab caf ? , a sunny place . " Here , " he said , " you will hear the music of my people , which you tell me you enjoy . " I sat against the wall . The proprietor hung up his best song birds in the sun of the balcony so that they sang . The mimosa trees rustled in the open windows . After a while two musicians came , and then a third , Mustapha . They sat before me on the floor with their lutes , Ahmed , Youssef , and Mustapha the first musician . While they were playing to me the proprietor asked if he might prepare a lunch ; and thereafter my ear was for the music , but my eye was for the master of the cafe and Mohammed squatting on the balcony and peeling potatoes and carrots and shredding meat into a big bowl . In time Mohammed himself led me to a dish of stew , seasoned with herbs . I ate as best I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , for the trouble of many forks and dishes is not in this country ; and the youth sat at my side , watching how clumsily I put food into my mouth and naming in Arabic each thing I ate . Meanwhile the sound of the music never ceased , nor the trilling of the birds with it ; and fragrance of the mimosa was in my nostrils with the taste of the stew . It was at noon the next day I must take the bus on my way to Mazagan , which is on the way to Fez . In the crowd round the vehicle stood the master of the cafe , and Ahmed , Youssef , and Mustapha , who had come to embrace me and to wish me Godspeed . Young Mohammed asked for a leaf from my note book and , having made room for himself in the crowd with his elbows , wrote on the paper in Arabic . " My friend , " he said , handing me what he had written through the open bus window , " here is a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find collecting custom at one of the gates of Fez . Give it to him , and he will take care of you . " When the bus started , they cried out , " Peace go with you , " and waved their hands . Mazagan and Azemour , Casablanca and Fedallah and Meknes , these are towns on the way to Fez , and Meknes is but a short stage from it . The letter which Mohammed had given me to Tahar the Gate Keeper was always in my pocket . I did not know what was written in it , for , though I took it out and looked at it , I could not read the Arabic letters ; and even had I been able to do so , I should not know the meaning of the words they spelled . Therefore , my curiosity had grown great about it ; and besides I thought , " Shall I go on to Fez , which Djilali told me is a city of wickedness , with a secret letter ? " Now , in Meknes I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel where Europeans put up , to show them the sights of the city and interpret for them when they wish to buy at the shops . He tried to persuade me to buy , for merchants would give him a percentage on all the trade he brought to them and he made his living thus , like all guides attached to Moroccan hotels . But I told him I had no money to spend and wished only to see the city , with its twisting little streets in which the stranger is soon bewildered , and the gardens which lie round it . When I walked with him through the city , I closed my eyes upon the old embroideries and the old brasses which were displayed in the shops and turned my ear from the merchants ' entreaties . But he would not give over his persuading . " Enough of the city , " I said at last . " Let us drive to one of the gardens where there are no people to push against me . " We sat down in the shade of the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hook which would teach him English . He knew French well , how to read and write it as well as to speak it ; " but , " he said , " many of the tourists who come here are from your country or from England , and few know how to speak much in French . This is too bad , for they have a great deal of money and would spend it if we could talk to them . " And this is certainly true , as they have a proverb in their own language which says , " At sweet words the lioness will give you her milk . " Then I thought of Mohammed , of the master of the cafe , and of the three musicians , Ahmed , Youssef , and Mustapha . I took the letter from my pocket . " You who can read the language of the Franks , " I said , " can you do the same with your own ? " For there are not many of the Moors who can read and write their own language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was written in this letter . " Show me the letter , " he said . I handed it to him , and he read it ; but when he had finished he would not tell me what was written in it , only that it was a good letter . Then we returned to the lintel without much talk . After we had got down from the carriage at the hotel gate he said : " Go , now , and eat . In the afternoon I will come for you and take you again to the city . " " But I wish to buy nothing in the city , " I said . " It is not for you to buy that I shall take you there , but to drink tea at my house with my friends . " When I came out from the meal I found him waiting at the hotel gate . He set off at once , walking swiftly , and I followed him into the city and to the shop of a merchant , who was young and fat . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fez , but on his hands leather gloves from Europe . " Show the merchant the letter which you showed me this morning . " I gave over the letter to Hamed , the merchant , and he read it . Then he brought up a stool . " Sit here , " he said ; and he went away with the guide who had brought me and left me alone in the shop . While I sat alone , Europeans came into the shop and treated with me as if the rugs and cushions all about were mine to sell . Presently my guide returned , carrying cones of sugar and sprays of green mint in his hand ; and at his heels the merchant returned . He sent away the Europeans from the shop , saying he would not trade with them to-day ; and he bade me wait in the street with the guide while he shut and locked the doors of the shop . This being done , we went through many crooked streets till we came to the door of a house , where Hamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped and looked . In the center of the house was a tiled courtyard , with the sun shining in it and an orange tree growing there by a pool , and four doors which opened into four lofty rooms . Having removed our shoes , we entered one of the rooms and sat on the carpet which covered the floor ; and when Hamed , the merchant , clapped his hands , a servant brought in a brazier with fire burning in it and a copper kettle , so that we might have tea . The servant brought a basin with water , also , for us to wash our hands . While the tea was brewing , Hamed laid the letter on his knee and translated to me what was written in it , which was about as follows : " Praise be to God , the One and Only . Mohammed el Barka wishes peace to Tahar , his cousin , and let Tahar receive the Christian who brings him this letter , and give him shelter if he needs it , and food and drink , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him in Fez , where be is a stranger . For the Christian who brings this letter is my friend and comrade and will give you news of me . " The servant brought cakes of almond meal for us to eat with our tea ; and when we had eaten and drunk and washed our hands , Hamed , the merchant , said to me : " Those in Safi shall not do more for you than I. Wait , and I will write you letters . " He wrote three letters to three rich merchants of Fez and wrote their names on the outer fold . But while I thanked him for the letters , I said I would not be beholden to three rich merchants since I had no affairs which could interest them ; that I desired only to see the people of Fez and how they lived . " Wait , " he said , " I have not yet done . You are a stranger and can not speak our language . The streets of Fez are steep and narrow . You can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens to help you . You must have a guide . I will give you the name of a man I know there who will be your guide and whom you can trust . Take your pencil and write down this man 's name in your letters so that you will not forget it . " I wrote down the name Mohammed Larosse . III From Meknes to Fez the road passes among hills which are big as mountains and gashed by the rains . In the valleys under the misty light and on distant slopes the iris and the flax were blue lakes in the red land , unreal lakes no keel could plow ; and the calendulas were gold that was spilled on the barren hillside . From the crest of the hills the road runs down to the plain in which Fez is sunk like a funnel with walls round the rim and the towers of mosques rising from below . The sun was shining on it . Beyond it were other hills . When I had eaten in my hotel , which was just without a gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in through the gate and walked along the street which is like a rim above the town , where there were high walls and trees in flower hanging their branches over them from gardens behind . A young Moor joined me , whose robes were somber and neat and who spoke to me politely in French . We were alone together ; for the business of the city was below , and those who lived up here , being rich , could sleep in their gardens through the heat of the day . It was not far , he said , to the gate where Tahar el Bouab sat ; and he showed me the way . There were camels and donkeys coming in through the gate , which Tahar counted and taxed . The camel drivers made their beasts kneel in the gateway and outside while Tahar read the letter I had brought and while he spoke to me through the young Moor . Since he was so busy , I begged him not to concern himself with me ; and he said he would come to see me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man took me to a quiet place . " Wait here , " he said , " and I will find you Larosse . " And in a few minutes he brought Larosse to me , for he had been idling in this upper part of the town . When I first looked at Larosse , the man who was to be my guide in Fez , which Djilali had said was full of wickedness , I thought there could be nothing more wicked than he in the whole city . Though he was young , his face was battered , his shorn skull dented with scars . His eyes , of a yellowish gray , were small and abnormally far apart ; his voice was hoarse and blatant . The hand he offered me was thin and soft and cold . And he attached himself to me ; for , he said , his life was mine because I was the friend of the merchant in Meknes . With this ill-favored and ill-clad man I first went down into the city of Fez . ' When we had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so narrow that the walls of the houses almost met above , he seized my hand and dragged me through a doorway , so that we were in darkness . I felt at my feet the invisible forms of men sleeping . Then Larosse pulled me to a corner and put my hand against the wall , in which I felt rungs set as in a ladder . He climbed up the wall through a hole in the roof , and I followed him and found myself in an upper chamber where the daylight was dim through a tiny window . On the floor lay a man wrapped in a black robe , and there was a pot of yellow flowers before him ; and another man , who had been leaning by the wall , crossed over and sat silent in a corner . Larosse sat down , and I sat down beside him , and no one said a word . From below came the sound of bellows blowing , which meant that someone would soon bring us tea up through the hole in the floor . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larosse in French ; for amid the shadows of the chamber where we sat so still the pot of flowers drew my eyes like the glow of embers on a hearth . At the sound of my voice the man wrapped in black raised his head , muttering a word ; and Larosse spoke to him in Arabic . Then the man rested his bead again on the floor ; but put his arm stealthily from the folds of his robe and , seizing the pot of flowers in his hand , set it away from him towards me . " He gives them to you , " said Laross ? . " The man is a gardener , and you will not lack flowers while you stay in Fez . " Another man climbed up through the hole in the floor . In the center of the room he stretched his arms a moment , then sat by the wall with a sigh of contentment . My companions chuckled and spoke to him , and he told them a story , laughing . " This man , " said Larosse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison . Two weeks ago he was walking in the town at night and he met a woman and wished to sleep with her . So she said , Come to my room and you shall sleep with me . ' But when they came to her room , there was another man in the woman 's bed . She liked him better and laughed . So this man was in a rage . He tore the blanket off the man in the bed and ran away with it . But the woman reported him to the pasha . They caught him and put him in prison for two weeks . Ile comes from prison now . That is why we laugh . " In a little while it was dark in the room , and when the master of the cafe brought up tea he brought two candles which he lighted . He brought with him also a little lute , which be played while we drank tea . I listened to the music and the sound of the men 's voices talking . When it was time for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dried their stems on a fold of his robe , and gave them to me to take to my hotel . In the street before the threshold of the house , in the glare of the acetylene lamps hung on the walls of the shops at hand , stood a young man waiting for Larosse . His face was fresh and comely ; and his eyes were lustrous , but one of them was bigger than the other . Larosse did not greet him , nor he Larosse . He walked with us swiftly up the steep , crooked streets which ascend from the depths of the city ; and when we came to the top into the wide street with the flowering trees hanging their branches over the wall , he sang along the way . His name was Hassan , and he was a fine singer for the pleasure of it . At the gate of the hotel I took money from my pocket to pay Larosse , who made his living by guiding strangers ; but he refused to accept it . Early the next morning he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in the city with the craftsmen , sitting with the potters while they turned their wheels , and with the weavers while they wove . Larosse took the shuttle from one of them and , sitting before the loom , shot it to and fro ; for he had been trained as a weaver . At the end of the day he likewise refused to take wages . On the third day we sat with the cobblers and the millers , the dyers of leather and the leather workers ; but we did not visit the merchants , nor stop to talk with those who called to us from their shops ; because Larosse knew I wished to buy nothing . At the end of that day I insisted so firmly on his accepting his wages that he admitted money buys food more than friendliness . When I took out my pocketbook I found I had not the exact amount of what I owed him , and he had no money to make change . Therefore , I paid him for the three days and with it for two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had served me faithfully , I thought it a good plan to pay him again in advance , as a sign of confidence between us . So I gave him a hundredfranc note as for a week in advance . His eyes glowed . " I will keep strict account , " he said , " and I will never ask money from you as long as you are in Fez , nor ever accept it from you again . " IV The next day Larosse said to me : " We have been too much in the city . We must make an outing in the country . To-morrow we shall go to the hot springs of Sidi Harrazem . " " Is it far ? " I asked . " It is about ten miles each way . But I will hire a mule for you , which is not dear in Fez ; and I will run by the mule , for such is our habit . " In the afternoon he returned to find me at the hotel . " I will bring the mule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I have thought and ordered food to be prepared for us in the city , which will cost less than food here at the hotel . So we can spend the whole day in the country . My friend Hassan will come with us . " " That will make three of us , " I said , " a pleasant number . And Hassan will sing . " " I will hire a mule , then , for Hassan , since it is not dear . " " And you can ride on the mule with him , which is better than running , " I said . The next morning I arose early and waited for my guide . After two hours he came . In the courtyard of the hotel was Hassan mounted on a mule ; and beside him stood another mule with a saddle-cloth of crimson and stirrups of hammered brass . I climbed into the empty saddle , and the mule stood peacefully while Larosse lengthened to my legs the cords of braided crimson silk on which the stirrups hung . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule by the bridle and shouting " Watch out ! Watch out ! " down the narrow streets . Hassan followed us , and the people crushed themselves against the walls to let us pass . At the bottom of the city there was a great press of people in the streets ; and donkeys , mules , and camels laden with swelling panniers stopped the passageway ; so that we could not advance nor retreat . Everybody shouted at everybody else , Baleki Baleld which means , " watch out " ; and the people walked under the neck of my mule and under the belly . Larosse disappeared , and when I looked back , I saw that Hassan had been separated far from me by the crowd . But after a while Larosse reappeared . Shouting fiercely , he parted the people before us and led my mule under an arch and into a courtyard where many animals were tethered . Here he bade me dismount , which I did . Then I followed him on foot through the streets again till we came to the house where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when we had climbed into the upper chamber he left me with four men of the country to whom I could not speak . But they were not unfriendly . They shared with me their tea and the fried bread which they were eating . So I spent an hour with them , wondering at the delay . Then Larosse returned and brought me down into the streets again . At the threshold waited a ragged boy . He joined us , for he was to run with my mule ; and when we had returned to the courtyard and I had mounted my mule , I thought we were ready to set forth to the country , because the morning was far gone . And , indeed , we went on our way through the bottom of the city and up on the other side of it ; but when we came to a sunny place , Larosse called halt again . He led my mule into an angle of the wall , where there was a door ; and there left me on the mule . Hassan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was alone . After a while Larosse came up the street towards me , leading a portly Moor . " This man , " he said , " is the master shoemaker for whom Hassan works when he works at all . He will go with us to the country . " " That makes eve , " I said , " and let us be started . " " But now I must fetch the lunch , " said Larosse and he ran away . Then Hassan came back and the boy who was to run at my stirrup ; and again Larosse came running with a young man who was shabbily dressed . " This is my friend , " said Larosse , " and he will go with us to the country . " " That makes six , " I said , " and let us be started . " The order in which we started was thus : Larosse , Hassan on his mule , the master shoemaker on foot , the shabby friend , I on my mule , and , at the tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run at my stirrup . We had proceeded but a little way when we stopped again ; and now there was a long discussion in Arabic and the party , without me , decided that the master shoemaker should ride on the mule with Hassan . This being decided , there remained the difficulty of elevating the master to the mule 's back ; for Hassan 's mule was not saddled and there were no stirrups by which the master could vault . Neither , being solid in years , could he spring to the mule 's back , and Hassan had not the strength to hoist him from the ground . Therefore , the master stood still by the mule , while the others ran about seeking a stone to serve as a mounting block . When they had found one , they led the mule to it and the master followed , and set one foot on the stone and lifted the other leg towards the mule 's back . But when his leg was high , the stone rolled and the master fell down . So they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close . Larosse , with his shabby friend , knelt behind him and set their shoulders beneath his buttocks , while Hassan leaned from the mule and caught his hands . Thus they raised the master to the height of the mule 's back , and he fell across it like a sack , and his turban fell to the ground on one side and the slippers from his feet on the other . While , with much shouting , Larosse and his friend set the master astride the mule , my stirrup boy recovered the fallen slippers and the fallen turban ; and when the master was adjusted and clothed , we started on again . We crossed by the bridge over the river which rushes through the lower part of the city , to the dense quarters on the other side ; then steeply up and up , past the Andalusian mosque , through the charcoal markets , and through a gate out from the city , before which lies a Moslem cemetery on the hillside . But Larosse was no longer with us . Therefore , the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground , and he and Hassan slipped from the mule and took the crimson cloth from its back to spread on the millstone . We all sat on the millstone and waited . They pointed back to the city , making motions with their hands as if they were eating . So I thought that Larosse had delayed for the food which he was to bring . Out through the gate came a horse galloping , and on the back of the horse Larosse with yet another Moor . They were proud . When we had mounted , they led the way along the road from the city across the plain which ties between it and the mountain . We jogged along like pilgrims . Across the sky rolled clouds that were both dark and dazzling ; sun and shade shifted on the road . The clouds cast their shadow on us and spilled a copious rain cold as adversity . We bent our heads in silence and drew our robes about us till the clouds passed over and we voyaged in the sunlight , singing . Far from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bread in his sack , which he shared with us as we rode along together . And for a while a woman , mounted on a donkey , accompanied us , nursing her baby and whacking the donkey on the neck , till the donkey slipped to his knees and the woman slid off over his ears , crying " Allah . " We drew near the mountains and went along the side of them , till we turned from the highway and followed a trail up a wild ravine . Far up the mountainside we came to the spring , where there are huts and shelters of woven grass . But the spring itself is in a cavern , forever flowing from a deep basin in the rock where a hundred men could swim . Men and boys were swimming there . A light of strange brightness shone in through the rocky arches of the cavern from outside . The water itself was bright with it , a luminous , pale green , and so clear that the bodies of the swimmers were not distorted and their shadows followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larosse had shed his clothes ; the man who had ridden with him on the horse , likewise ; and the shabby man , and Hassan , and the youngster who had run by my stirrup . They dived into the water and swam Like fish ; but the shoemaker and I stood on the rim , watching them , for he could not swim , and my clothes were not easy to slip from . When the master of the spring saw this , he led us away to a leanto of bamboo , and spread for us a wide rug of red-and-yellow wool . Then he brought fire in a brazier for us to warm our hands and hot tea . The shoemaker made a sign as he drank that he was happy to be with me ; and I made a similar sign to him over my glass . To us , under this lean-to , from which we looked out on the bare mountainside running with rain and mud , the others returned ; and here boys brought us a dish of stew and loaves of bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We sat round the bowl and ate . While we were eating , shepherds came down from the mountainside , uncouth men with long hair , and stood outside the lean-to in the rain , looking at me curiously . After we had eaten , Hassan sang ; and the shepherds stood outside . Sleet now fell with the rain , and the wind was biting cold ; but when we had mounted our beasts and set off again Hassan began to sing . We came down out of the ravine and turned towards the city . Though the youth who had run by my stirrup was not tired , I had heard enough of the patter of his feet on the road and of his strained breathing . So T hauled him up behind me on the mule and we drew my burnoose over both of us to protect us from the slashing of the rain and sleet . As we drew near Fez the clouds broke apart so that a light shone down on the roof-tops from the sky , and cries of rejoicing mingled with the cracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My companions shouted , with a great shout : " Praise to Allah ! " ; for in a patch of blue some watcher on the towers had spied the pale new moon which ushered in the month of Ramadan . " It is our custom , " Larosse told me , " to picnic in the country before the fasts of Ramadan . " Thus we returned to the city which was full of wickedness . They thanked me for the picnic we had had . One by one they came to stand by my mule and raise a hand to shake mine , saying , " May God give you grace " ; for in these words one says " thank you " in their language . Then we parted . V All through the night the faces of these men were before my mind , in each a contentment and a gratitude glowing . But when , at the end of the next day , Larosse hung about MC , delaying to go , his face was ashamed . " Will you give me a few coppers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So you spent the whole hundred ? " " There is none left . " For this , I am certain , he felt no shame . No one had ever paid him money in advance before . Perhaps some had trusted him with money to guard , and he had guarded it faithfully . In Morocco many a , rascal meaner than he is responsible to such a trust . But nobody had ever given him money and then said , " Now go work for it . " That was a refinement of Christian generosity beyond his conception . I had thrust a hundred francs upon him . Lavish and improvident , he had shared my bounty with his friends , even with me . But he remembered to his mortification the valiant foolish pride with which he had accepted my gift and which could not now stand the strain of hunger . In the experience as in a book was written for me the lesson in Moroccan responsibility . Should I read it to him , beginning : I paid you , Larosse , because I trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should I discipline him in the conditions of Christian generosity ? I remembered Mohammed el Barka in Safi , the musicians who had played for me and wished me Godspeed , the kindliness that would brook no return , the letter ; I remembered Hamed , the merchant , closing his shop to serve me teain his house with cakes of almond meal . As I had received kindness in Safi and Meknes , could I not return it in Fez ? " We had a glorious time , " I said , " worth more to me than the money . Here are your wages for to-day . " Thereafter , since I was a Westerner and fearful to live except within the strict counting of my money , I took care to have in my pocket the change to pay Larosse each day his just due . Yet meanwhile in that secret upper chamber , which I might not have entered but for Larosse and to which he brought me daily still , more and more gathered to meet me . They said , " We have heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The gardener took me to his garden and gathered for me the late flowers and the early fruits . The poor vied with one another in doing little things which only the poor can do generously . Guides more exalted in the hierarchy of guides , men of fine manners , subtle , handsome to look at , took charge of me as their guest . Even through the streets some rumor ran , for in those very streets which Djilali had said were full of wickedness , strangers stopped me and said , " We have heard of the picnic . We have heard also that you dined last night with ben Nejma . Dine with us to-night . " Until , upon the final night of my stay , surfeited with kindness , I cried out to them , " You who have been lavish with me , how can I make return to you , since you will never come to my country and I can not receive you as you have received me ? " And they said , " In your traveling you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , you will surely do for us . " But it is now many days after and the wide waters are between them and me . No Arab comes to my door whom I may speed on his way through a foreign land ; and I pay in advance only honorable servitors who would never betray me to picnic in Fez.
