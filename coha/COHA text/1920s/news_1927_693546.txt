txt Vice President Dawes and Speaker Longworth , the respective presiding officers of the Senate and the House , signed the Farm Aid bill this afternoon , and it will be sent to the White House tomorrow with their attest that it was passed by the Senate on Feb. 11 and by the House yesterday . The presentation of the measure at the White House tomorrow will have a seemingly important bearing on the situation in that it will mean that , as the President will have the constitutional period of ten days before Congress adjourns on March 4 to consider the bill , he can not dispose of it by a " pocket veto , " as some persons here have been predicting . Three courses are left open to Mr. Coolidge : He must sign or approve the bill : or return it to the Senate with his disapproval , otherwise veto it ; or he must let it become a law without his signature . While divergent argument over the action the President will take was rampant today , those in a position to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veto the measure . Thu NEW YORK TIMES correspondent has reason to believe that the President 's disapproval is assured already , although such a statement can not be made in a public way in any authoritative quarter . Will Consult Cabinet Members . Mr. Coolidge will follow his usual course of referring the bill to the Cabinet officers chiefly concerned , with a request for their views , and is expected to study these views before taking formalaction , even though his conclusions as to the bill 's disposition had been reached before they are presented . At the White House this afternoon it was said on the President 's authority that he had talked with some members of the Cabinet about the bill , and when it reached him he would consider it " the same as any other bill . " The members of the Cabinet whose views the President naturally would seek are Mr. Mellon , Secretary of the Treasury , whose department would be concerned in the heavy Government financing which the bill involves , with its provision for a Federal loan of S250,000,000 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the major share in the administration of the scheme for farm relief which the bill provides , and Mr. Hoover , Secretary of Commerce , whose department deals with economic conditions . All three of these members of the Cabinet are opposed to the measure on principle as well as from the conviction that it will not give the benefits to the farmers and the country that its sponsors predict . It is taken for granted here that if the President relies on their advice , the only question will be as to the degree of the emphasis with which he will return it to the Senate without his approval . In the spirited discussions of the situation at the Capitol today  --  not on the floor of either House , but outside the legislative chambers  --  the fundamental premise of the arguers appeared to be that the President would be actuated by political reasons in determining what action he should take with reference to the farm aid measure . Expect Politics to Govern . The underlying idea of most of those who debated the question was that the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House in giving consideration to the bill . Among advocates of the bill the view was prevalent that if the President did net permit it to become a law he would never serve another term in the White House . There was a disposition of some of the bill 's more pronounced Republican protagonists to go so far as to say that the President , if he vetoed the measure , would be surrendering the Republican nomination to former Governor Frank 0 . Lowden of Illinois . Some others modified this to the extent of substituting the name of Vice President Dawes , another Illinoisan , for that of Mr. Lowden , for the Vice President is looked upon as the god from the machine who engineered the deal between Congressional advocates of the Farm bill and the Banking bill , which made possible the passage of both measures . A report that a White House veto of the Farm bill might lead under certain circumstances to the organization of a third party movement in the West in 1928 was put in circulation here today . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farm leader and son of the late Secretary of Agriculture Wallace . Talk of a Third Party . Mr. Wallace stated that if President Coolidge vetoed the Farm bill and appeared as a candidate for re-election With Governor Smith of New York as his Democratic opponent , the farm States of the West would go into the field with a third party ticket , headed by either former Governor Lowden or Vice President Dawes . Members associated with the farm bloc admitted the possibility of a third party candidate in the event of the renomination of President Coolidge ; that is , taking it for granted that there would be no farm relief legislation between now and the national election of 1928 . Some asserted , however , that it was too early to speculate on the possible influences of the farm situation on Presidential politics . Certain Congressional opponents of the plan countered ' predictions of that character by ex- I pressing confidence that , if President Coolidge vetoed the measure in accord-1 ance with his pronounced conviction that it involved questionable principles . I he would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term would be certain in spite of the traditional American distaste for a third term . These visualized the President after vetoing the bill as being popularly hailed as a man of courage , even in the corn belt States . It was freely asserted that Mr. Coolidge would thereby gain support from many who might be favorable to what the bill sets out to do , but could not withhold their admiration for a man big enough to take the chance of throwing away further political preferment because he put principle above expediency . The expectation among men in a position to know the President 's attiture toward the bill is that he will send it back to the Senate  --  the house in which it originated  --  with a veto message that will be a strong condemnation of the farm relief plan It embodies . The chief predicted grounds of the President 's disapproval are that it is of doubtful constitutionality in that it curtails the President 's power of appointment by directing that he shall make his selections for offices created by the bill from nominations submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for farm relief may be unworkable and is certain to be extremely costly ; that it fixes prices in spite of the claim that it does not ; that it will help the farmers temporarily only , and that through encouraging overproduction of the farm products to which the bill applies it - will lead to worse conditions in agriculture than now prevail . Provisions of the Bill . Here is the essence of the farm bill as it was passed by Congress : It provides a revolving fund of $250 , - 000,000 to finance the handling of farm surpluses . This fund ultimately is to be returned to the Treasury . , To defray the cost of administering I the act an equalization fee is to be levied upon an agricultural product in which an ? emergency is held to exist , the collection to be made at the processing point . Wheat , corn , hogs , cotton , rice and tobacco are the basic cignmodities designated by the bill . A board , to consist of twelve members , one from each Land Bank district , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove farm surpluses from the market . While the President would make the appointments , he would be restricted in his choice to nominations made by farm organizations . The board is authorized to make loans through cooperatives and other agencies , through which it will operate . In handling surpluses with a view to stabilizing the domestic market , the excess would either be impounded in this country or sold abroad . The various agencies that would operate in conjunction with the Farm Board would require numerous employes , with an overhead running , according to the Treasury , up to about $790,000 a year . In addition to the Farm Soard , the bill proposes the creation of an Advisory Council , to be made up of representatives of farm groups . The bill provides that , where a majority of the farmers raising a commodity are not members of an organization through which they can express their opinion as to whether an equalization fee should be levied or not , the sense of such a group shall be obtained in a convention called by I the Farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contention that it was a price-fixing scheme and that it would put the Federal Government into business .
