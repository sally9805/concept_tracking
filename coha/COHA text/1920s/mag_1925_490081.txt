BEHIND THE NEWS It Seems to Them THE first major casualty in the World 's crusade to make the Broadway theatre a finer and a better and a nobler institution has been that innocent bystander , Heywood Broun . As a direct result of the World 's unwillingness to tolerate plays it recently discovered to be surfeited with shame , Mr. Broun will leave the paper at the end of the current theatrical season . There is a possibility that he may remain , but since this is based on the execution of a complete about-face , the wise money does not look for any such result . An editorial on " Ladies of the Evening " started it . The editorial , headed " A Cheap Skate on Broadway , " expressed the burning indignation of Walter Lippman , the late Frank Cobb 's successor as editor of the World , that such things could be . Perhaps " Ladies of the Evening " would have been a sensational box office success even if the World 's editorial had not appeared . In the nature of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World 's editorials . But at any rate , capacity audiences have been the rule at the Lyceum Theatre since the denunciation was printed . " A Good Bad Woman " opened and , with derisive and unstimulating comments from the critics , was well on its way to the storehouse . The Comedy Theatre , where it was shown , has a small seating capacity , and yet on the second night of the play 's run tickets were to be found in large numbers in the cut-rate offices . Enter , at this point , Arthur Krock , a member of the editorial council of the TVorld . Mr. Krock previously had been assistant to Col. Henry Watterson of the Louisville Courier-Journal , and later , as an important aide , helped Mr. Will Hays in his activities among the movies . His official positionnow is " Assistant to the Publisher , " Ralph Pulitzer . Mr. Krock sent to William A. Brady 's office for the manuscript of " A Good Bad Woman " and read it , one hopes , religiously . After the ordeal he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which was duly printed . Pardonably mistaken in the matter , Percy Hammond of the Herald Tribune credited this evidence of the World 's sudden high morality to the guiding hand of Herbert Bayard Swope , the Executive Editor . But Mr. Swope was another innocent bystander , the new policy having been decided by Messrs . Lippman and Krock while he was suffering at home from bronchitis . At this time the news department of the World began to regard statements by William A. Brady on the dirty nature of his show as excellent news copy , to be rewarded with front page headlines and pictures . Variety , the recognized authority on theatrical box office matters , on February 25 published the following illuminating paragraph : " Although he withdrew ' A Good Bad Woman ' at the Comedy after playing it two weeks , W. A. Brady made money on the engagement .... The three days following the open/ ing performance there were plenty of tickets in cut rates . Front page publicity created a big demand , however , and from then on the show played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 . " Mr. Broun , in his column , " It Seems to Me , " had been observing that the World 's editorial and news campaign was bound to lead to re-sults , of w h i c h , conceivably , the World itself might not approve . In order to have fine plays , it seemed to him in his column , it was necessary to have as complete freedom as possible . Better , it seemed to him further , a few dirty plays than a policy of suppression that would take away fine plays too . ( District Attorney Banton , as might have been expected , immediately arranged for the rewriting of scenes in " Ladies of the Evening " and clamored for the closing of " Desire Under the Elms . " ) Shortly after the appearance of the columns in which he differed with the World , Mr. Brous was summoned to Mr. Swope 's office and informed that he would have to stop airing his differences with his paper 's editorial policy . It was the opinion of the editorial council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a World employee to dissent f r o m the opinion of the TV orld , after it had once been formulated by the paper 's editorial council . ( The editorial council includes Messrs . Pulitzer , Lippman , K rock , Swope , John O'Hara Cos-grave , John H. Heaton and Florence White , the business manager . ) Mr. Broun h a d entered upon his World job under the impression that articles written in a column headed " It Seems to Me " were to be inspired by whatever seemed to him . So , the following day , he repaired to the World offices to discuss the matter with Mr. Pulitzer . He learned that the publisher did not agree with this interpretation of his freedom of print . The opinions of Messrs . Lippman , Krock , Swope , Pulitzer and of other members of the editorial council must be accepted as orthodox . It was the chief 's opinion that Mr. Broun had been permitted too much liberty . You have so many things to write about , said Mr. Pulitzer , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing leading to another and back again to the original point , Mr. Broun served notice that he desired to leave the World immediately . Mr. Pulitzer was unwilling to agree to this , which left Mr. Broun with the single alternative of quitting his work when his contract expires , or in about sixteen months . Since then , through further conferences and the growing realization by Messrs . Broun and Pulitzer of the impossibility of the situation , a new arrangement has been made . It is understood at this writing that Mr. Broun is to be free to leave the paper at the end of the current season . Park Row , and the uptown centers of the newspaper world , wait with avid interest Mr. Broun 's departure , being anxious to learn whether the circulation gained by the clean plays campaign will offset whatever loss his going may involve. ? Siste V iator Call " Beekman 2,000 " In achieve the news pages of the Times and the t of the papers , call " Beekman 2,000 , " which is the telephone number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies who love , perhaps not too well , but wisely . Mrs. Stillman discovered the method . Mrs. Budlong continued its successful application during that exciting week when she was subjecting her husband 's linen to public washing . She telephoned " Beekman 2,000 " on the evening of her return to her husband 's twenty-two room apartment and the American , always gallant , responded with a copyrighted story on its first page the next morning , Saturday . The copyright line did the trick . It roused professional jealousy . Just as soon as they could learn what it was all about , the city editors of the more dignified journals opened their pages to the self-imprisoned lady , keeping them open for a week , until Mrs. Budlong disappeared into the void whence she emerged , via another exclusive and copyrighted story in the American . erican . And the facts were all so dreadfully simple : Mrs. Budlong has last , in the Rhode Island courts , her suit for separate maintenance . Her husband , following the advice of his expensive counsel , wrote a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgarians referred to as " his bed and board . " The lady ignored the communication . A year passed . The lady became worried . She consulted Max Stever , an effective if not wholly original procedure . " Go right up to your husband 's home , " Mr. Steuer advised . " You 've a perfect right to live there . Go there and stay a short time . " By " a short time " Mr. Steuer meant overnight . The eminent counsel dropped out of the case forthwith , and Mrs. Budlong played safe by interpreting the phrase as meaning a week at least . So , after telephoning " Beekman 2,000 " and being turned over to " our Mr. Helm " by the city desk , she locked herself in and withstood a mild seven days ' siege by some of William J. Flynn 's operatives , who were employed by Mr. Milton J. Budlong to assure no more first page publicity 's being created than was absolutely unavoidable . Gentlemen with Wall Street connections and marital difficulties nowadays are keenly reminiscent of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town after Mrs. Stillman had telephoned " Beckman 2,000 " and had been referred , in that instance to " our Mr. Fowler . " It was a merry farce , that week of beleaguement . Reporters waked alarmingly the aristocratic quiet of East Seventy-fifth Street , led in their prowling by the ubiquitous Hearst men  --  Helm of the American and Markowitz of the Journal . The detectives relieved each other in shifts and took turns reading to Mrs. Budlong , through her locked door , such excerpts from the daily newspaper accounts as might show her in an unenviable light . Mr. Budlong , frantic as he watched the story spread from the blatant American headlines to those of the dignified Times , passed his days and nights in consultation with twelve  --  count ' em , twelve  --  lawyers . It did look like a great story : woman locked in her home ; refused food ; denied communication with the outside world ; on the point of starvation ; shut off from her friends  --  great stuff ! Only , it was n't exactly so . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see anyone  --  except reporters . She could telephone anyone she wished  --  except reporters . She could walk out of the apartment any time  --  the sooner the better for Mr. Bud long . But Mrs. Budlong was interested only in seeing reporters and staying where she was , so she resorted to3 the expedient of throwing notes , wrapped in Mr. Budlong 's silk shirts , from her window to the battalion of reporters . The operatives diverted themselves by throwing notes out , also , which were dirty even before they landed in the gutter . The week 's duty done and her defense against a possible charge of desertion prepared , Mrs. Budlong issued forth , pa-using only to repay the American by giving to " our Mr. Helm " a further exclusive story . The first pages of the Times and of the other dignified newspapers reverted to normal , so to remain until some other misunderstood lady appeals for succor to " Beekman 2,000.
