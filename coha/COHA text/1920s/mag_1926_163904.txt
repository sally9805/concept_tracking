Recently there stood in the dock of the Old Bailey , famed London law court , one more tatterdemalion derelict of the thousands that file in and out of that hall of Justice every year . His furtive , watery eye , his mumbled speech and disconsolate countenance marked him for a waif indeed . He was penniless , friendless , and without an advocate . <P> But good English custom lets no man , however sunken in estate , go undefended at his trial by law . The judge told the prisoner to look about and choose whom he would from the gathering of barristers that lounged there in genteel boredom waiting for their clients ' names to be read off . Whom he chose would have to serve him , willy-nilly . <P> Passing by eager youngsters , mournful oldsters , bead-eyed Jews and dour Scots , the prisoner brought his dull gaze to rest upon a distinguished figure of some three-score years . <P> " Hi 'll tike that un , " growled the prisoner . <P> Over " that un , " as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be caught , there passed dismay , mortification and sheepish acquiescence . Commanded by custom " that un " had no course but to accept the derelict 's defense and look forward to the official fee of 1 . " That un " was no less a personage than Sir Travers Humphreys , Recorder of Chichester , Senior Counsel to the Treasury at Central Criminal Court ( Old Bailey ) since 1916 , one of London 's most eminent attorneys . Ordinarily Sir Travers ' fees never think of halting short of four figures .
