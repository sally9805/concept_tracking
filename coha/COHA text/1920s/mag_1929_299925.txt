When Bishop James Edward Freeman , who read the funeral service of Presbyterian President Wilson , was chosen to head Washington 's great Episcopal Cathedral ( TiME , Oct. 19 , 1925 ) many an ill-advised scrivener referred to the Cathedral as a U. S. Episcopal Vatican , to Bishop Freeman as its Pope . Then rumors were legion that the national headquarters of Episcopalians would be transferred to from Manhattan . But , though still sporadically consider the the headquarters have remained they were . Nevertheless , last week , Bishop Freeman spoke to the annual convention of his diocese , thoroughly condemned church lobbying in Washington , his words might well have been paralleled to a papal " " dictum . They pointed to a policy which the national Episcopal Church had observed , and from which it would countenance no deviation . <P> Said the Bishop : " The maintenance of any organized system designed to coerce legislators or to dictate legislation , state or national , is utterly foreign to a right conception of the Church 's function . . . . The founders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . . . . This principle has been carefully preserved and maintained throughout our history . Only in the past year has its consistency been questioned or its validity challenged . A subtle effort has been put forth in certain places to revive old animosities and to renew old suspicions . . . . That we have the supreme right to judge men and parties by moral and ethical standards is generally conceded , but this does not mean the measuring of men and parties by their respective religious shibboleths or affiliations . Nothing could be more subversive of the principles laid down by the fathers of our Republic than such a course . " <P> There was no doubt that the Bishop had in mind the recent charges by Washington Methodists , that Washington Catholics were lobbyists , the Catholic answer that not they , but the Methodists themselves were the lobbyists ( TIME , May 13 ) . Nor was there doubt last week that Bishop Freeman and his Church intended to have no such reproaches cast at them .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
