The Famous Mrs. Pair . Adapted from the play by James Forbes , and , on the whole , well-adapted , except near the finish . There the customary race between the midnight express and the speeding automobile just had to come in , to be followed by the customary fisticuffs in the hotel-room between the well-manicured villyun and the simple but hearty brother of the ingenue . <P> The Fairs had a happy home till Mrs. Fair became a war-heroine . Then Mrs. Fair decided that woman 's place was on the lecture platform and departed on a $30,000 tour of the country , leaving Husband to be consoled by a distressingly vivacious widow , Son to marry a poor but virtuous hello-girl , and Daughter to fall into the clutches of nicotine , complexion-clay and her mother 's manager . But everything came out happily at last . The cast is pretty adequate , though not exciting-the direction and detail good . <P> The Bright Shawl . Another adaptation , this time from Hergesheimer 's novel of conspiracy and abortive rebellion in the Cuba of 1850 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet misses genuine impressiveness - partly , perhaps , because Dorothy Gish , as the Spanish dancer , le Clavel , seems pitifully miscast . She does her very best with it , but the role simply does not fit her . Richard Barthelmess , as the adventurous young American dandy-hero , is better but not wholly successful . A word should be said in favor of Jetta Gondal who portrays a scintillating Chinese vamp and Anders Randolph as a sinister Spanish captain . The direction is intelligent , the supporting cast splendid and the picture , in general , well worth seeing-what it lacks is a couple of drops of genius-and that is no uncommon lack . <P> You Ca n't Fool Your Wife . A banal triangle-story of " fashionable society " produced in the usual deluxe , ooze-leather edition way . The chief characters rejoice in enormous stucco palaces-there is a pervasive flavor of butlers , Rolls-Royces and The Book of Etiquette about it all . A bathing revel occurs at Miami in which all the guests have taken the wise precaution of substituting swimming gear for the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of them , of the " When came the dawnlight " school .
