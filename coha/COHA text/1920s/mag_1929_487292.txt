S ALVATORE ACCORSI . Remember the name . It belongs to an obscure Italian workman now on trial for his life in Pittsburgh for the murder , in 1927 , of John J. Downey , Pennsylvania State trooper . On August 22 , 1927 , a number of workers and their families were holding a meeting in the apple orchard of a private farm near Cheswick , Pennsylvania , to protest against the execution in Boston of two other obscure Italian workmen named Sacco and Vanzetti , doomed to die that very night at twelve . Almost as soon as these fatal names were mentioned , mounted State police burst into the farm and with tear gas , clubs , and revolvers broke up what had been a quiet and altogether legal meeting . In the confusion and violence that followed ? during which 300 men , women , and children were injured ? John J. Downey , one of the troopers , was killed . Meanwhile at Russelton , six miles away , Salvatore Accorsi , according to several witnesses , had been busy repairing his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the road in the car . He was stopped by some of the raiding troopers who were searching for the murderer of Downey , questioned , and then permitted to go on . Accorsi continued to live in Russelton , unmolested , for eight months following the murder . Then , since he was out of work and had been evicted from his home by the Republic Iron and Steel Company , he moved to Staten Island with his wife . Meantime , at the coroner 's inquest , the troopers who took part in the raid on the meeting swore that they did not know who fired the shot which killed Downey . Almost two years passed . In June , 1929 , W. M. Brown , one of the State troopers , remembered with miraculous clearness that it was Salvatore Accorsi who had shot Downey . Accorsi was found in Staten Island , living with his wife and children  --  two of them born since the Cheswick raid  --  and working as a day laborer . He was indicted for murder , and extradited to Pennsylvania where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save him . We hope that both will be forthcoming . T HE PROMOTION of Colonel Patrick J. Hurley , Assistant Secretary of War , to the headship of the War Department places in charge of the military forces of the country one who himself fought with distinction as major and lieutenant-colonel in the World War . The press has made much of the fact that he is the first citizen of the old Indian Territory , now Oklahoma , ever to enter the Cabinet . This is interesting , of course . Far more important is the question , which can not now be answered , how much of a militarist he is . It was very much to the credit of the late Secretary , Mr. Good , that he refused to make jingo speeches and showed a general disinclination to let himself be used as the mouthpiece of the War Department militarists . We sincerely trust that Colonel Hurley will profit by this example . A man of large means , a founder of the United States Chamber of Commerce , a bank president for several years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ardent advocate of a change in our military situation . Yet the very fact that he is a man of affairs must create the hope that he will loyally support the President in his desire to cut down the tremendous expense to which the government is now put for our needless military and naval burdens . F ROM VARE TO GRUNDY ? what a fate for Pennsylvania ! No sooner is the former again rejected by the Senate and welcomed back to Philadelphia by 2,000 of his supporters who greet him with " We are back of you , Bill , " than the Governor must needs offer the vacant Senatorship to Joseph Grundy , prince of tariff lobbyists . And in a way Grundy merits it . No one has worked harder for the manufacturers of Pennsylvania who own the State . No one living has , we suppose , raised more money for the Republican Party than he who poured $800,000 into the Coolidge campaign fund and $1,000,000 ? one-tenth of all that was raised to elect him  --  into Herbert Hoover 's campaign treasury . Are these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party of prosperity and unlimited campaign funds to exalt the man who can rake in the cash at election time more expertly than anyone else ? Ought we not to have on the floor of the Senate the man who declares for tariff walls so high that not a single foreign manufactured article which is also made in Pennsylvania can surmount them and enter this country ? Let us by all means have in official life a champion of the tariff ultimate  --  the logical conclusion of the
