The man in the street watches a 72-story building go up and queries : What will cities look like in the future ? What innovations will there be ; how will people live in the tall buildings ? Two architect-prophets have recently published books* in which each essays to predict the future of the metropolis . Le Corbusier , a Swiss whose real name is Charles Edouard Jeanneret , famed in Paris for his revolutionary ideas and dicta on city-planning , tells didactically and illustrates exhaustively his version of the future . Hugh Ferriss , romantic U. S. draftsman of modernistic architectural elevations in black and white , illustrates his predictions with drawings which he calls " not entirely random shots in the dark . " <P> Le Corbusier 's hypothesis is that man , a reasonable being who pursues his way with a purpose , will build his city on the principles of geometry - " the means created by ourselves whereby we perceive the external world and express the world within us . " The Corbusier battle cry is Order ; without it tomorrow 's metropolises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York and all Continental cities . According to him , city planners must use architectural physic and surgery . Obstacles will be man 's persistent following of the least resistance line , his respect for the past . As the straight line is best for the ideal city , the curved line being too rococco and impractical in an age of metal construction , the city of the future must be planned rectangularly . His projected city has a concentrated business district in the centre of vast areas of suburban residence zones . In the morning the workers pass by rapid transit to large " vomitories " or stations whence they are whisked by subways to the basements of their respective skyscrapers . The vertical city quickly fills up , work is begun . Shortly after noonday the working day is over- " the city will empty as though by a deep breath . " If man applies himself , says Le Corbusier , the ideal can be realized . He sums up : " Immense industrial undertakings do not need great men . " <P> Hugh Ferriss 's city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of which dictates its own architecture . Centres and sub-centres comprise the Business Zone , the Art Zone , the Science Zone , each with its ramifying departments . Buildings of glass and steel arise 1,200 ft. , supporting vehicular highways on varying levels . There are avenues 200 ft. wide at half-mile intervals . Draughtsman Ferriss transfers this obvious , romantic vision into a series of pleasing , misty drawings made appealing by the use of breath-taking perspectives and powerful light effects . Practical critics observe that the scheme is ephemeral and utilizes such tricks as leaving out windows which , if represented , would convey the proper scale and give a realistic effect to Architect Ferriss 's momentous masses , but would make these masses seem much less momentous and startlingly visionary . The drawings are accompanied by a lyrical text which breaks out into blank verse at times and ends with an epilog-The City Could Be Made in the Image of Man Who is Made in the Image of . . . . <P> <P> *THE CITY OF TOMORROW-Le Corbusier- Payson &; Clarke ( $7.50 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
