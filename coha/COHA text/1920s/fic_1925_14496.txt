The main hall of a hacienda on the heights of Panama City , as seen on a late summer evening in the sixteen-hundreds , is a large , lofty room , with heavy door to left , and a deep window to the right . A noble stair at the rear leads to the second floor . Two young women , MARIA and CARMENCITA , are seated at a refectory table . They are youthful , dark , vivacious Spanish girls of the Castilian type , both very much alive . They are flaming in evening dress . MONTALVO , a cub-like captain , very military , is standing with his back to the stairway . It is obvious that all are awaiting dinner . A slave is arranging candles , and the room becomes lighter . MARIA What is it like , this pleasure of killing a man ? Does it make you feel cold  --  or warm ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO That depends on what you are like , and what kind of man you like to kill , and what led up to the killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade . CARMENCITA How many do you suppose you must account for when you face the recording angel ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO How do I know ? I never take scalps . MARIA But the first time  --  did you turn cold or warm ? p. 3 CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Both  --  and a little seasick . MARIA Was it  --  she pointsthat sword ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO drawing sword.Yes  --  do you mark that blade ? Mark the sheen of its steel ? A Toledo smith forged it for my grandfather . He never used it all his life till the day of his death . MARIA He was killed using it , cousin ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO He fell upon it . CARMENCITA In a fight ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO No . When he learned that my grandmother had run away to Italy with her confessor  --  a young priest who had not taken final vows he took my grandmother instead . Holding blade toward MARIA . Feel that edge . It must have been some satisfaction to know at least the steel was true . Sighs . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a proud man . CARMENCITA But a fool . Were a wife 's virtue worth dying for , I fancy all the world would be nothing but Spaniards falling upon swords . p. 4 CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Sapristi ! seorita , but you have a low opinion of your kind ! CARMENCITA An accurate one . MARIA Would you , Cousin Pedro , kill yourself were I to run away with an unfrocked priest ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO hesitating.No . Only the unfrocked priest . You are too pretty to kill unless a man might kill you with his love . MARIA Sweet dying , cousin , could I choose the man . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO And who would he be ? Some fair-haired Englishman , I 'll say , such as Esmeraldo 's slave who rode with you to Panama City yesterday ? CARMENCITA You have her there . She has a fetch for that cold , gaunt , ugly groom . MARIA I have none . But still , an Englishman  --  a raw Englishman , now a broad man with a heart in his breast none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CARMENCITA The child would like a pirate , perhaps ? MARIA If he were a great one with broad shoulders and curls . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Doubtless this Morgan would serve you well , Maria . Peradventure you have only to take ship and sail through the Caribbean of a moonlight night , and you will have your Morgan . A heavy price , though , you 'd pay it is said he uses women as he does mangoes  --  once only . p. 5 MARIA Can a woman expect more than one night of love ? If I thought I should find this Morgan I should take ship at once . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO He 'd wring your neck and drop you into salt water . Do you fancy that an Englishman has hot blood in him ? Has your mistress any hot blood in her ? CARMENCITA She is colder than Jacob 's pillow You will see . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Cold ? But she has charmed Esmeraldo . MARIA She is cold like the slopes of a volcano in winter . There is a smoldering hell under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three months , and still his hands are cold . Spaniards take it for granted that a woman knows how to love . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Ah ! She thaws a little for him , do n't worry . CARMENCITA No , not a degree . I 'd know . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO You would ? CARMENCITA I 've watched . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO What fiends you are ! Holy Mary , but I 'm hungry ! CARMENCITA What would you have ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Well , nothing to eat . Drink . p. 6 CARMENCITA Milaga ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO A cask . CARMENCITA goes out of room , up the central stair.Trust me . MARIA When they are alone together  --  and it is rarely  --  what would you say she called him ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO King Phillip ? MARIA No . Seor Don Esmeraldo . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Well , that 's his name . MARIA But one expects a little more than that from one 's affianced ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO What she calls him is negligible but , does n't she  --  ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in a very delicate way , that is  --  but  --  CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO But what ? MARIA The snow cap is firm . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO But she still will thaw . Imagine Carmencita with her lover  --  or imagine what you 'd do . Show me just once . MARIA But I am not affianced and Donna Lisa is and has been married before , too . p. 7 CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO And learned nothing ? MARIA as CARMENCITA returns with a flask.How to keep accounts to lock a wine cellar to give dinners . To MONTALVO . At any rate , she has not learned to keep her best vintages out of the gullets of returning soldiers . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO I will drink it all . She will never know . I will carry the flask away . CARMENCITA pouring a gobletAnd the wine , too ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Does your conscience hurt ? One should be willing to do a little thieving for a soldier . I shall be able to tell you in a moment whether you have stolen well . Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full . I lower it a quarter inch . She sips it . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO MARIA sits . There . I shall never know whether or not it had a bouquet of its own you have scented it with your breath . MARIA Very pretty ! He has come back the courtier , a scoundrel and a gallant . And where did you learn these manners ? In the guard ? p. 8 CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO From a thousand sweethearts ! He drinks . CARMENCITA Faithless ! CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO But none anywhere near so fair . Holding his cup for more . CARMENCITA Faithless , and a flatterer . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Better a faithless flatterer than simply faithless . MARIA Here 's Basilio . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Not our old Basilio ? MARIA See for yourself . BASILIO , a dandy , comes in from the right . BASILIO FERNANDEZ Ho ! Our soldier of fortune , back with his stolen finery ! He embraces MONTALVO . And how did you leave L'Ollanaise ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO We wrecked him . BASILIO FERNANDEZ Prize money ? Jewels ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BASILIO FERNANDEZ You deserve them . Six ships were in port for fear of him . You could buy half the town with a pocketful of that gold . These pirates ruin trade . p. 9 CARMENCITA Do n't talk of pirates again . It has a curious effect on my interior . Servants enter with dishes for table . BASILIO FERNANDEZ Talk of food , then . I 'm famished . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO There he is . Sit and eat . BASILIO FERNANDEZ I do n't dare . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Frightened of Donna Lisa ? BASILIO FERNANDEZ Rather . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO She bites ? BASILIO FERNANDEZ I 'd hate to put my hand in her mouth when she 's angry . So would Don Jacinto . MARIA You will see . It 's almost time for him . He 's always here . She charms him . He can not move in her presence . Sometimes when he leaves at night , I fear he will sleep outside the door . A loving hound ! Head between his paws BASILIO FERNANDEZ with irony.It must be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far from it . BASILIO FERNANDEZ But she is marrying him . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO She would marry somebody . It 's not an easy situation , being an English widow in a Spanish city . p. 10 MARIA But he is wealthy . What 's the adage ? Pieces of eight just naturally go to bed with doubloons . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Shall we bait the Don when he arrives ? CARMENCITA What about ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO About marrying a frozen saint . MARIA You can bait Don Jacinto , but be sure you do n't try it with her . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO She 'll freeze your entrails . CARMENCITA She 'll look at you once , and your viscera will turn cold . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Will some one carry me a challenge to this writing-school mistress and let me choose the weapons ? She will blow cold , and I will blow hot . BASILIO FERNANDEZ Tread lightly , warriors all ! We do n't want to spoil the match . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO proudly.I 'll be circumspect . I spent six days with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARIA Try them on me . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO They 're for widows only . DON ESMERALDO , an elderly gentleman , enters from upstairs , coming down left stairway . MARIA sees him first and rises . They all rise. p. 11 DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Greeting , Montalvo ! You 've grown famous . Has it been a year ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Half a year , anyway . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO And , Basilio , you have n't climbed the heights for weeks . Something wrong ? BASILIO FERNANDEZ Nothing . Just business . Pressing matters of state and commerce . Much seems to have happened since I was here . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO For instance ? BASILIO FERNANDEZ You have won a fair lady . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Oh , that ! True . Let 's sit down . Donna Lisa will be here presently . MONTALVO seats himself in chair at right of table . MARIA Not there , you forward beast ! That 's milady 's place . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Mother of Christ , where ? MARIA Anywhere else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven nowadays , of course . BASILIO FERNANDEZ He did n't hear you . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Who ? I ? Oh , yes . That is Why ? p. 12 CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO A successful lover , and asking why ? BASILIO FERNANDEZ Does n't that require explanation , Esmeraldo ? DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Explain it any way you like . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO I ca n't . I simply ca n't . BASILIO FERNANDEZ They do say the English are cold-blooded . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO But they breed like other races , I suppose ? The same , as it were , preliminaries ? BASILIO FERNANDEZ Oh , the same . That 's established . CARMENCITA to MONTALVO.Surely you know . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO God has spared me the English . BASILIO FERNANDEZ Is it so bad ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO The rumor goes , they make love at a distance of nine paces , like fish , the girl in one corner of the room , her lover in the other . When their affection waxes warm they look at each other and blush , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief ! BASILIO FERNANDEZ After what ? p. 13 CARMENCITA I sha n't say . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Don Esmeraldo is , of course , the authority . We should ask him for details . They occasionally kiss , of course ? DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO They ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO The English . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO I suppose so . BASILIO FERNANDEZ I hope we do n't embarrass you ? DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Not at all . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Is it true that the English ladies prefer to receive no intimate attentions from their lords , sending them instead to the restricted quarters of the city for such common pleasures ? BASILIO FERNANDEZ Oh , I assure you that must be an exaggeration ! The population is maintained . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO But against the best morals and instincts of the race . BASILIO FERNANDEZ Absolutely . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO to MONTALVO.Have you seen this English buccaneer who has been ravaging the coast of the south ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Can you ask ? Had I seen him only one of us would have lived to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO But you have heard of him . MONTALVO shrugs . BASILIO FERNANDEZ One does n't hear of much else these days . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Have you heard that he threatens to take Panama and sack it as the barbarians sacked Rome ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO No . But he 'd say it if he thought of it . He might even try it . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Do you think he might succeed ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Take Panama ? Never ! DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO He took Porto Bello . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO A different matter . He can approach Panama only from the sea . There 's no trail overland through the brush . The mountains are impassable except to the Indians . A dull cannon shot is heard from the distance . MARIA rises . MARIA What 's that ? BASILIO FERNANDEZ That ? Do you think it 's your Captain Morgan ? MARIA No . But  --  DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Another boat-load of slaves escaped , Maria . They fire a cannon to start the hunt . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lost a fortune in slaves last year . They drift to the jungle and evaporate . DONNA LISA enters by stair . They all rise to greet a beautiful woman of thirty-five , whose light hair and blue eyes , set off by gray silk and pearls , are in quiet contrast to the other women . Captain Montalvo , Donna Elizabeth . She bows silently. p. 15 DONNA LISA Shall we sit down ? BASILIO FERNANDEZ We were talking , Donna Lisa , of English customs . DONNA LISA Yes ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO He euphuizes , my lady . We were talking of English love-making . BASILIO FERNANDEZ No  --  of carp fishing . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO On the contrary , we were talking of English pirates and escaping slaves . You heard the cannon ? DONNA LISA seems not to hear . I hope it bodes me no more ill luck . MARIA But what has this Captain Morgan done that everybody is afraid of him ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Everybody ? MARIA Well , I am . CARMENCITA They say he 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard them say he eats broken glass and drinks poison . MARIA That is n't the whole story . They say he goes on four legs and roars like a bull , and wears horns on his head . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO All I can say is I wish he 'd come to Panama on his four legs and try roaring like a bull . CARMENCITA Heavens , I do n't ! p. 16 MARIA I 'm mad to know what he 's like , and I suppose I never shall unless he comes to Panama . BASILIO FERNANDEZ No , and he 'll never come to Panama , and you 'll never find out . But take my word for it , he 's a very common kind of yellow dog . They all are , these freebooters . They took the Scorzona , one of our fleet , searched her for valuables , carried off three women , and then scuttled her . CARMENCITA Do they carry off women ? BASILIO FERNANDEZ Does that thrill you ? CARMENCITA Beyond words . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Well , child , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of something else , Donna Lisa ? DONNA LISA On my account ? Oh , no ! CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO We had a perfectly healthy subject going on and were just warming up to it when Don Esmeraldo choked us off with pirates . Now as to this matter of reciprocal affection among the English , my own opinion is DONNA LISA looks at him . He pauses. that is , I know very little about it  --  but surely , Basilio , you  --  BASILIO FERNANDEZ I 'm afraid I ca n't help you . A pause. p. 17 DONNA LISA icily.You were about to say something , Seor Montalvo ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO I ? Oh , no ; I think not . DONNA LISA Something about affection among the English . Do proceed . I am English , you see  --  and you had a theory to propound ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO I suddenly remembered your race , Donna Lisa  --  DONNA LISA And paused out of deference ? But you must continue . I insist . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Really , I had nothing to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened ? BASILIO FERNANDEZ Could he offer flattery more sincere , Donna Lisa ? He will tell you himself that he was never frightened before . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO to ESMERALDO.You say the governor is really worried ? DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO I 'm sure he is . And good reason , too . His scouts have lost trace of Morgan 's fleet . He may have landed somewhere , and except for the jungle and walls we are almost undefended inland . DONNA LISA He keeps strict sentry-watch ? p. 18 DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Well , he intends to . I sometimes fear our governor is less energetic than the situation demands . In fact , I 'm sometimes tempted to call him a pompous ass . BASILIO FERNANDEZ Not to his face ? DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO It would do no good , either to his face or behind his back . He 'd still be the governor . And I have a good deal at stake just at present . An explosion of some magnitude is heard without . All rise except DONNA LISA . DONNA LISA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he had left near a chair.Basilio , shall we take a look around ? BASILIO FERNANDEZ I 'm with you . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO It could n't have been from the harbor . It was nearer . Dear , do you mind if I go along ? DONNA LISA It 's probably nothing . We may as well finish our meal in peace . Basilio will bring us the news , if there is any . BASILIO and MONTALVO go out . Sit down , please . Pause . They all seat themselves , but do not eat , waiting rather nervously . There is another detonation . The girls scream p. 19 DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO I must go . DONNA LISA Go if you must . ESMERALDO starts to kiss her hand ; she gives no encouragement , and he goes out . CARMENCITA Donna Lisa , I 'm so frightened . It 's something terrible , I 'm sure . MARIA What can it be ? DONNA LISA We 'll know before long . It 's almost certainly of no consequence . I 've lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any consequence has taken place in that time . Rises . In England things do happen occasionally . When I came to the Caribbean with my husband I looked forward at first to one long sequence of adventures . The height of extravagant excitement in Panama City is a cock-fight , two ancient and wary birds encountering each other without the slightest animosity . If I fail to die of malaria I shall die of pure lassitude . MARIA One can always make violent love . DONNA LISA It does n't amuse me . CARMENCITA Have you ever tried it ? DONNA LISA One does n't make violent love unless one is violently in love . CARMENCITA Oh , I do ! p. 20 DONNA LISA And I should imagine even violent lovemaking would begin to pall after a time . CARMENCITA Never . DONNA LISA Oh , Lord ! MARIA and CARMENCITA go to the street door . There is a sound of blows and a sudden confusion outside . The girls retreat hastily . MARIA Donna Lisa ! CARMENCITA Oh , oh ! The street is full of soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stands listening . There is a loud knock.Who 's there ? CARMENCITA retreats to a far corner . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO outside.It 's I  --  Esmeraldo ! For God 's sake ! DONNA LISA opening.Quick ! ESMERALDO slips in . She bolts the door after him . What 's happened ? DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO The pirates have blown up the wall ! Basilio 's killed ! DONNA LISA Basilio ! MARIA Oh , did you hear ? CARMENCITA coming forward.No . A sudden tumult outside , which dies away. p. 21 MARIA It 's the pirates . Basilio 's dead . They 've broken the wall . CARMENCITA Basilio ! It ca n't be . MARIA Where 's Montalvo ? DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO The last I saw of him he was chasing two pirates down an alley-way . I think he meant to drive the whole crew out single-handed . It 's all useless , though ; they have the town . The garrison is surrounded in the castle . CARMENCITA What are we to do ? DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO They 'll search the houses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come in here ? DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Surely . CARMENCITA There 's the lower vault . They 'd never find it . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Are you sure ? MARIA It has a secret door . I can hardly find it myself . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Then carry down what you need at once . There 's no time to waste . You 'll have to stand a siege , perhaps of some days . And hurry ! They may be back at any moment . MARIA to CARMENCITA.Come ! Are you coming , Donna Lisa ? They go out. p. 22 DONNA LISA No , I think not . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Dear , you must ! You have no conception what brutes they are . DONNA LISA I shall not hide in the cellar of my own house  --  not from anybody . Why should I pretend I 'm frightened when I 'm not ? DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO But I 'm frightened for you . These desperadoes will seek every residence and ravish every woman . It 's madness not to take what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They may be in some danger , since they are frightened . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO I must insist  --  DONNA LISA Then insist , since you must . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO You will come ? DONNA LISA No . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Forgive me , then , if I take matters into my own hands . I shall carry you . Goes to her . DONNA LISA There will be no carrying . I am quite able to walk wherever I wish to go . I do not wish to conceal myself in the Malaga vault  --  nor will I , Seor Esmeraldo . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Dear , you 're mad , quite mad ! p. 23 DONNA LISA No . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO But what are your plans ? DONNA LISA If we are so unfortunate as to receive unwelcome visitors , I shall know how to deal with them . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Deal with them ! There 's no dealing with these monsters . DONNA LISA Do you , too , credit those servants ' fables , about monsters ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And men , in my experience , are credulous creatures , much easier to handle than the gentlest of women . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO You have n't answered me . What are your plans ? DONNA LISA I shall sit here  --  and read , perhaps  --  if you are too unnerved to talk . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO I unnerved ? My dear , you wrong me ! Except that my fear for you would unnerve any one . DONNA LISA If you are not afraid , sit down . He looks at her , speechless for a moment ; then seats himself in chair . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO leaping to his feet.Now  --  will you come ? There 's still time ! DONNA LISA bored.Oh , my dear , somebody must answer the door . She goes toward the entrance at the right . If I do n't , they 'll break it down , and it would be a pity to spoil the paneling . He leaps to stop her . There is a thundering knock just as she undoes the door . ESMERALDO catches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betraying us to the English ? DONNA LISA I shall remember that ! She wrenches her hand free and flings the door open . ESMERALDO draws his sword . Good evening , gentlemen ! Three English sailors enter ; they are in dirty white shorts and sandals , with black lanyards about their throats , with rather evil-looking sheath-knives dangling from them . There is a cutlass on the belt of each , and two heavy chased silver pistols above their hips . All have bright red scarves about their heads and wear very fine black pig-tails and incipient beards and moustachios . Two are apparently common seamen , while the foremost is undoubtedly a sailor of consequence . His uniform is better . He wears a brassard with some quaint insignia upon his right arm , bound with a band , for none of the sailors has more on his chest than an armless singlet . GEORGE CASTLE the first pirate.Stand aside , lady . He levels a pistol at ESMERALDO over DONNA LISA 's shoulder . Down , my hearty ! Sit down before you lie down . ESMERALDO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible . There 's fifty of us here , and the other forty-nine are rough boys . Out of my way , lady , and stand by for jewel inspection . Go through the house , Davey , attic to cellar . p. 25 DAVE the second pirate.Ay , ay , sir . GEORGE CASTLE Take the upstairs first . I 'll stand guard . DAVE and MITCHELL , the third pirate , start for the stairs . DONNA LISA One moment . This is a purely business matter , as I understand it ? GEORGE CASTLE No doubt about it , ma'am . DONNA LISA It can be accomplished then without firearms , I presume ? GEORGE CASTLE Nothing 'll suit us better , ma'am . We do n't do any more fighting than we have to . We get too much as it is . DONNA LISA Very well , then . We shall put nothing in your way . If there is anything here that you particularly value , take it . But kindly leave the room in order , and finish as quickly as possible . GEORGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out in five minutes . Sorry about my feet , ma'am . I forgot to wipe them . Your jungle 's muddy as hell . DONNA LISA As for the stuff , I suppose you can discover it for yourself ? GEORGE CASTLE Not without gutting the place , ma'am . You make my work easy for me , and I 'll guarantee to leave your quarters shipshape . Make it hard , and we 'll wreck it . p. 26 DONNA LISA I see . Well , to be frank , I have a few jewels . No , to be frank , a good many . GEORGE CASTLE That 's fine . DONNA LISA You 'll find them in the first room to the right as you go up the stairs . The jewel-box is on the chest under the window . GEORGE CASTLE And money , now ; you keep a stock of Spanish doubloons , no doubt ? DONNA LISA Money , I must confess , has been rather rare in Panama since the embargo declared in consequence of Captain Morgan 's depredations . Our vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counting houses have had little to do . GEORGE CASTLE But you must have a supply on hand , lady . DONNA LISA It has run low , I give you my word . GEORGE CASTLE I 'll take your word for it , but where is it ? DONNA LISA In the chest under the jewel-box . GEORGE CASTLE And if you do n't mind my sailor ways , the key is ? DONNA LISA picking one out of her girdle.Here . GEORGE CASTLE Excellent . Lads , you heard that . Get the pretties and the money . I 'll keep the seor company . The two other pirates start toward the stair . No loitering on the job , Dave . Looks at ESMERALDO. p. 27 DAVE Ay , ay , sir . They go . DONNA LISA Will you sit down , George ? DONNA LISA sits at the end of the bench before the table . GEORGE CASTLE How did you know my name was George ? DONNA LISA Oh , you look like a George , that 's all . I can tell a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , I used to live in England . GEORGE CASTLE In England ? What part , ma'am ? DONNA LISA Wo n't you sit down ? GEORGE CASTLE Why , thanks , I will . He sits on stool . Now , I 'm from Yorkshire myself . DONNA LISA Of course . I might have known . There never was a countryman from Yorkshire without some trace of manners . GEORGE CASTLE Huh , well , I 've known some that had a rather reckless way with ' em , before women and all that . Still you may be right . DONNA LISA Is there any news from England ? GEORGE CASTLE Oh , you 'd hear more than I would . We have n't touched at a port for months . You see , I was pressed for the navy and fought in several actions and then sort of got lost from my ships , you see  --  p. 28 DONNA LISA Yes ? GEORGE CASTLE And then I just ran into Morgan , and there was n't much else to do ; so I joined up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see , if you 're lucky . But I 'm not really a bad man , ma'am . DONNA LISA No , I 'm sure you 're not . GEORGE CASTLE I 've been rough ; I wo n't deny that , but I know a lady when I see one DONNA LISA Thank you GEORGE CASTLE I mean you , ma'am . But I 'm different from some of the lads with Morgan , I can tell you . Some of them are pretty wild . Morgan himself is pretty wild . But there ai n't anything in that , I say . It 's discipline and a firm hand that counts . And Morgan gets discipline . He wo n't stand any foolishness while there 's work to do . DONNA LISA Really ? GEORGE CASTLE Now you 'd think from what you 've heard that we 'd all be drunk tonight , would n't you ? DONNA LISA Yes , I think I should . GEORGE CASTLE I give you my word , not a man in all the crew has had a drink since supper-time last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insists on it , you see . If he finds a man drinking or if he even thinks a man 's been drinking , he lays him out  --  just like that . p. 29 DONNA LISA But he is n't always so strict ? GEORGE CASTLE Oh , no ! After it 's all over , they 'll raid the cellars and get as full as lords . They 'll probably get hold of some of the women , too , and I would n't answer for what 'd happen . DONNA LISA Does Captain Morgan allow that ? GEORGE CASTLE Why , yes , he kind of does . He goes in pretty strong for women himself , occasionally ; and I was just going to advise you , if you do n't mind DONNA LISA Of course not . DAVE and MITCHELL come down with a bag and a chest . They set down the chest and sit on it . GEORGE CASTLE Now , if you 'd just stay upstairs out of the way till we 're gone  --  you see , this is the best-looking house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it sometime , and I 'll put a watch over it and it may do some good DONNA LISA You mean GEORGE CASTLE I mean I 'm kind of influential with him , and I would n't like to have anything happen to you ; so if you 'd just stay upstairs DONNA LISA I will , thank you . GEORGE CASTLE You 're quite welcome . CAPTAIN MORGAN enters the door quietly , unattended . He is a fierce man of forty , unkempt , stocky , hairy . GEORGE , who has his back to the door , does not see him . DONNA LISA rises and faces MORGAN . There is a pause. p. 30 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You soldiering sailors ! Is madame receiving ? GEORGE and sailors spring up . We have one night to sack a city ! One night , and I find my first mate with a woman ! Castle , you 're either drunk or you 've run mad . Who is this man ? Pointing his blade at ESMERALDO . GEORGE CASTLE Do n't know , sir . Found him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door.And what 's that ? GEORGE CASTLE Gold and jewels , sir . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Have you inspected them ? GEORGE CASTLE No , sir . Have n't had time . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Do you call that seamanlike ? How can I keep my accounts straight if I ca n't depend on my first officer to look into his seizures ? Do you expect a share out of this cruise ? Where are the slaves ? GEORGE CASTLE Have n't seen any , sir . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Have you searched the house ? GEORGE CASTLE Not thoroughly , sir . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN What do you think the English navy 's coming to , with fools like you in command ? I thought you were an officer , Castle . To DAVE and MITCHELL . Put down that stuff . Search the house . They start toward the stairs . No , let the upstairs alone . They 'll be in the wine cellar . Look for the concealed doors . Rap the walls . Listen for girls . Fire a pistol and you 'll hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish girl from screaming when she hears a gun . You ! DAVE and MITCHELL go out to the rear . As for you , George Castle , you 're through . Samson gets your place . Follow me , and bring that grandee with you . He goes to the outer door . GEORGE hands ESMERALDO ahead of him and follows . MORGAN turns . Fetch that woman along ! p. 31 DONNA LISA rises , trembling with rage.Leave my house ! CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN turning in astonishment.What ? DONNA LISA You cur ! You lout ! You swaggering two-for-a-shilling bully ! Leave my house ! CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN English ? DONNA LISA Your presence here is an insult . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN British , by God ! Starts toward her . Come , milady , I 'll have to take you . DONNA LISA George , are you no better than your master ? GEORGE CASTLE I 'm sorry , ma'am . Not much , I 'm afraid . DONNA LISA Then you disappoint me , and I must show you the door also . Leave Seor Esmeraldo here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , ma'am , and you , too . DONNA LISA You despicable servant ! You groom ! I am Lady Neville , and I give orders but never take them . Once again  --  there is the door . Pointing . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN looking her up and down.You hear the lady , you ass ? Do as she bids you . GEORGE , in utter stupefaction , looks first at one and then at the other , and starts to go . A moment , Castle . Tell Samson he 's replacing you as second in command . Tell him to comb the city for treasure and keep every man sober till we 're three days at sea . Tell him to spread a report that the Spaniards have poisoned all the wine . Tell him to use his judgment . Then put yourself under arrest and sleep in the brig tonight . Your prize money 's cut to one-twentieth. p. 32 DONNA LISA Indeed , he should not be put under arrest . He erred only in excessive kindness , and the fault was more mine than his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interested.And by what right , lady , do you presume to intervene in this matter ? DONNA LISA Your orders are patently unjust . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN And by virtue of what precedent do you claim authority to give me orders ? DONNA LISA You are a commoner , sirrah  --  common in blood , in education , and in spirit . You have the look of a hostler 's lackey . Can there be any question among us here as to where the authority lies ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I had thought not . DONNA LISA Then I refuse to have him punished for treating a lady with courtesy . Restore him his share and his command . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN with a sweep of his hat.Lady , to put it bluntly and in plain sailor talk , I 'll be blowed . Further than that , I 'll be damned . I might be God-damned . DONNA LISA You may well be . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN As a matter of fact , lady , the very look of you means England to me , and I find myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blood and only too recently engaged in lewd conversation , unable to refuse your slightest request . Unable , madame , if I may make so bold , because my heart tells me that if I were to step but a pace nearer you I should catch the scent of Devonshire roses from your hair and the fragrance of English hawthorn from your sweet body . England , madame , is a passion with me , and the stench of foreigners is poison to my blood . You are English  --  we are English together . We are met at the end of the earth ; yet there is an indissoluble bond between us . Let us make a compact . Let us be friends . I would to God I were a gentler man . p. 33 DONNA LISA You betray your birth again , Captain Morgan . None but a lout would play the courtier with an effusiveness so indecent . Yet there is a core of truth in what you say . You are a stranger here . If I can befriend you in any way CAPTAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to need nothing at present . I have in a way , and I fear somewhat rudely , helped myself to the freedom of your city . But my gratitude is none the less . DONNA LISA And as to George , here  --  CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You shall have your way . Castle , you retain your commission . You have my orders . Carry them out . As GEORGE goes out , two slave girls run in , screaming , from the rear and throw themselves at DONNA LISA 's feet . DONNA LISA lifting her skirts and stepping back.Do n't touch me . Stand up . Do you think you are safer on your hands and knees ? They crawl after her , moaning . CARMENCITA and MARIA are brought in , somewhat disheveled . CARMENCITA Oh , Donna Lisa ! Oh , my lady ! We are lost . MARIA English dogs ! DONNA LISA Captain Morgan , call off your men . p. 34 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Walk off to the gate and guard this house . Let no one enter or leave . DAVE and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself at his feet and embraces his knees . Mercy ! Have mercy on us ! MARIA kneeling to him. I will pray to the Virgin . I will pray to Maria for you . A thousand white candles . Have mercy . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Damn the Virgin ! Do n't come to me with your Popish talk . MARIA clasps him also . He tries vainly to extricate himself . Lady , for the love of God , call off your dogs . DONNA LISA Maria ! Are these manners for the daughter of a nobleman of Spain ? Carmencita ! You are too familiar with the Captain 's person . You act like a slave . Rise ! The girls rise and slip back in terror . This is Captain Morgan  --  a guest . MORGAN bows low ; they return the greeting . You must forgive our country gaucheries , Captain Morgan . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN As a commanding officer of some experience , madame , I advise a bit more discipline . DONNA LISA I need no advice , sir . Yet in truth you must excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine . p. 35 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN My fault , I am sure . DONNA LISA Not at all . Maria ! Carmencita ! It 's growing late , and the evening has been exciting . It would be as well if you went to bed . MARIA Yes , Donna Lisa . The girls go up the stairs . DONNA LISA Go , girls . She waits for them to go and then stands facing MORGAN . And now , Captain Morgan , we are glad to have had the pleasure of your company , and we know you are a busy man . We shall not detain you longer . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I was about to ask the favor  --  DONNA LISA Anything CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Only this . The town is in considerable confusion . There is , I am afraid , no other household so quiet as your own . I own myself to blame for the conditions ; yet I very much need a good night 's rest . Could you find it in your heart to lodge a countryman for the night ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests and innocent of evil intentions ? DONNA LISA We shall be glad to shelter you , Captain Morgan . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN kissing her hand. I shall not forget your kindness . p. 36 DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO starting to his feet.For God 's sake , Donna Lisa , do you realize the kind of farce you are playing ? DONNA LISA Perfectly , Seor Don . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Do you realize that this barbarian is in possession of the town , that we are at his mercy , that he could cut all our throats at any moment ? DONNA LISA Perfectly . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN But we have tacitly agreed to forget that , seor , and to play the game of chivalrous guest and gracious hostess . I hope it does n't annoy you , sir . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO It does annoy me . A game you can forget when it 's most convenient for your purposes . What guarantee does your guest give you , milady , that the women are not to be assailed and the rest of our throats cut before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Morgan into the street , what assurance would we have of the safety of our lives and virtue ? I prefer to play the game . I have been remiss , Captain Morgan . This is Seor Don Jacinto de Esmeraldo , formerly of Seville , a gentleman whom I hope you will like , for he is my intended husband . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN bowing.My felicitations , Seor Esmeraldo. p. 37 DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO You may rot in chains and stink in hell , you verminous cutthroat , you robber of tills and violator of little children ! This game of yours ends here . I know an older game and one more suitable for men . You will step outside with me ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You are in the presence of a lady , sir . Put up your sword . DONNA LISA Seor Don ! If you have ever valued me , put up your sword . Captain Morgan is a guest in my house  --  not yours . ESMERALDO leaps at MORGAN , who draws . They fence . MORGAN , entirely good-humored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play.Have you ever done much of this , my friend ? DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Enough . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN No , not enough . You must live to take lessons . With a little practice you might do well . He drives ESMERALDO back toward the stairs . You should be the better perhaps for a night 's sleep . He drives him up step by step . Let us finish in the morning . ESMERALDO , disarmed , turns tail and runs upstairs . MORGAN sheathes his sword , comes to table , takes the biggest chair , settles comfortably in it , and looks at DONNA LISA . How quiet and restful it is here ! p. 38 DONNA LISA But you are tired , Captain Morgan . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I 've often dreamed of a place like this . A perfect city . A perfect woman . A good day 's work done . That reminds me . I meant to leave here tonight , until I saw you . DONNA LISA Indeed . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I put in the first three days of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture me . Yes ; to be safe , I should have left here tonight . DONNA LISA We shall be pleased if you can stay , of course . Yet , if you must go CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Oh , I sha n't go now ! I do n't think they 'll catch up with me . I do n't think they know where I am . And as I say , I 've often dreamed of a place like this  --  and a woman like you . Is n't it strange  --  out of all this Indies  --  here we are together alone . DONNA LISA Do you fear capture ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I dare say it 's fate . DONNA LISA That you will be captured ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Oh , no : that we should be together . DONNA LISA I fear you waste time here , Captain Morgan . You have taken Panama City . Surely you have orders to give and much to do . I will excuse you . p. 39 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN It is my business to take towns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I leave all that to your friend George . A good officer , George , except when you are around . Sit down , please . She sits . He hitches his chair closer to her . What a grand place this would be to settle down in ! DONNA LISA Have you thought of giving up  --  er  --  the sea ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Oh , often . I 've often dreamed of a place like this . Here we are , as I said  --  DONNA LISA Yes , I know . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN  --  alone together . DONNA LISA Yes ; you have said that , Captain Morgan . But did you not say you were tired , and in need of a good night 's rest ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I was tired of the others ; not of you . Pause ; he helps himself to the Malaga . DONNA LISA When you wish to retire , you will find your room at the head of the stairs to the left . You do look weary . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Malaga ? DONNA LISA No , thank you . p. 40 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN It 's excellent . DONNA LISA Thank you , no . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN drinks.I do n't know when I 've had such a pleasant evening . DONNA LISA We have a surplus of pleasant evenings here . They grow monotonous . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You find this one like the others ? DONNA LISA Oh , precisely . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN hitching his chair still closer.With you and me together alone ? DONNA LISA You are easily entertained . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN rising.Not so easily . DONNA LISA Oh , finish your wine , sir , finish your wine ! It 's my best , and you taste it . There is nothing in the world like Malaga to induce a refreshing sleep . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Sleep , lady , with you under the same roof ? You do me a great injustice . DONNA LISA Captain Morgan ! CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You have said you look upon me as a rogue , a person of low origin , not of your world but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it is I who speak it , one of the great of the earth . An admiral of genius , a leader of men , even  --  at heart  --  something of a poet ,  --  and most of all a devotee of beauty . Lady , it was at your shrine that I worshiped . It was for you I hoped as I cut my way through Spanish lines to Spanish gold . It was you I longed for . I long for you now ! p. 41 DONNA LISA Do you expect me to believe this ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN No ; I expect you to be moved by it . DONNA LISA But it happens I 'm not . Takes up a book . Have you read any Chaucer ? Here is a most interesting volume , containing Troilus and Cressida and the Legend of Good Women . Shall I read to you ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN From a legend of good women ? No , I thank you . DONNA LISA Do you wish to retire immediately ? I hope I 'm not keeping you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DONNA LISA I am a trifle bored , yes , Captain Morgan . I had no idea pirates were so sentimental . You will pardon me ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN his face going black.By God ! DONNA LISA No , no  --  do n't swear , I beg  --  there 's nothing more childish than swearing . You will find your room , sir , at the head of the stair , at the left . I imagine your conquests must have been mainly among kitchen maids ? Your technique is bad . A pause . Truly , sirrah , you had best go to bed before I laugh at you outright . She goes back to her book ; he stands irresolute . Oh , you must listen , Captain Morgan ! You would love Hector . She reads . Now was this Hector piteous of nature , And saw that she was sorrowfully bigoon , And that she was so fair a creature ; Of his goodness he gladed her anoon , And sayed , Lat your fadres treson goonForth with mischance , and yes yourself , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Troye . MORGAN goes to the stair . Oh , but this next stanza ! And all the honour that men may doon you have , As forforth as your fader dwelled here  --  MORGAN starts upstairs . You are n't going , Captain Morgan ? He makes no reply . But if you must good night . p. 42 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN low ; without turning.Good night , hell ! He disappears . DONNA LISA dropping her book and laughing. @x The same scene , early the next morning . The room is as it was left , DONNA LISA 'S copy of Chaucer lying face downward , open , on the table . The chest brought down by the pirates stands where they dropped it , and a particularly villainous-looking low-grade pirate is kneeling at it , patiently trying one skeleton-key after another on the lock . He is ill at ease , and once , at a slight noise , looks around stealthily . As he works with renewed interest , having found a key that promises to do the trick , MONTALVO appears in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MONTALVO draws his dagger and advances silently . At his thrust the pirate slips to the floor without sound or sigh . MONTALVO wipes his blade on the bandanna which the dead man was wearing , tiptoes to the window , looks out , then starts to ascend the stairs . MARIA enters from the rear , carrying a small water-jar . She sees the fallen pirate , stifles a scream , sets down the jar , and retreats to the wall , her hand to her throat . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO He wo n't bite you , Maria . MARIA Oh ! Montalvo ! CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Be quiet . Are there more of them ? MARIA How did he get in here ? p. 44 CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO The way I got in . By the lower passage . I caught him at Donna Lisa 's chest . MARIA You killed him ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO He 's my third . Why are there sentries about this house ? MARIA Morgan 's here . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Here ? Where ? MARIA Upstairs . Asleep . CAPTAIN MANUEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO But , my God ! where 's Donna Lisa ? MARIA In her room . Sound asleep . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Remember  --  I 've been hunted like a rabbit all night , Maria . I 've killed three men in one way and another . My eyes ache from looking steadily at one doorway these last four hours . I ca n't endure much more . Do n't try to be amusing . MARIA Do I look amused ? Go up and look for yourself . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Where 's Carmencita ? MARIA Sleeping , I think . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Well , Cien nul diablos , I am crazy ! Did you give him lodging for the night ? p. 45 MARIA Just that . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO And then go quietly to bed ? MARIA Just so . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO And nobody hurt ? MARIA Only Don Jacinto . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Well , at least , the Don made trouble ! How did it happen ? MARIA You see , they sent him to bed  --  CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO They ? MARIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute  --  wait a minute ! Morgan and Donna Lisa sent Don Jacinto to bed ? MARIA Yes . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO And he went ? MARIA Under protest , yes . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO And then ? MARIA Then Donna Lisa sent Morgan to bed . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO What ? And he went ? MARIA Yes . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO How do you know ? MARIA I was waiting in the hall upstairs to see how she came out with him . p. 46 CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO And then ? MARIA Then Donna Lisa went to bed herself . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO And to sleep ? MARIA She always sleeps well . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO But Don Jacinto was hurt  --  MARIA Yes . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO How ? MARIA About the middle of the night he went to Morgan 's room and assailed him by surprise . They fought it out , and Don Jacinto was wounded in the groin ; but not seriously . Morgan has a slight touch in the shoulder . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Um ! You seem to be getting along pretty comfortably here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insanity . On the whole perhaps I 'd better go . MARIA But you 're much safer here . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO With Morgan in the house ? MARIA Oh , he 's as much a gentleman as yourself ! CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO pointing to the sailor 's body . And what will he say to that ? MARIA He 'd say you were quite justified . The fellow had no right here . He was robbing his own company . p. 47 CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO You think so ? CARMENCITA appears on the stairs . MARIA He says himself there 's always a rough element that gets out of hand when they 're sacking a city . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Oh , he does ! You appear to be familiar with the great man 's conversation . You find him agreeable ? MARIA Not half bad . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO You had a chat with him ? CARMENCITA sweeping down . A chat with him ! I do n't know what you call a chat , but if she did n't spend the night with him , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy heaven , what 's that ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Just a dead pirate , Carmencita . CARMENCITA Who left it here ? It must be taken out at once . Where are the porters ? MARIA There is n't a slave in the house . I 've looked even through the vaults for them . They 're simply gone . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO So we are to congratulate you on a conquest , Maria . When a buccaneer captures your town you proceed to capture the buccaneer . Neatly done , neatly done ! p. 48 MARIA She knows nothing about it . She was asleep . I merely went in to bandage his wounds . CARMENCITA It 's well you 've learned to lie with a straight face , my dear , for you 'll need all your talents in that direction . Don Jacinto tells another story . He told me while I was bandaging his wounds that he found you there . Yes , and it was you who roused Morgan and saved his life . MARIA I have nothing to say except that Don Jacinto lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finality and goes out . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Has Donna Lisa heard of this ? Crossing toward her . CARMENCITA She did n't wake , and I did n't like to wake her . I knew she 'd be angry . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO At whom ? CARMENCITA Don Jacinto . She had instructed him that Morgan was her guest and was to be given every courtesy . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Ah , yes ! She 's English , of course . And so is he . Doubtless a buccaneer is as good as anybody else , in England . CARMENCITA Or better . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Why , yes . In a nation of pirates such a one should be a sort of nobleman . He turns . You need n't tell Donna Lisa I was here . I 'm going . p. 49 CARMENCITA But where ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO pausing . I do n't know . He sits down disconsolately . My place is a wreck . The whole city 's a wreck . I saw them carrying out my gold plate last night . By the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in at dawn and sent a boat ashore . CARMENCITA Morgan 's ? DONNA LISA is descending the stairs from the right . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO I suppose so . Came to carry my gold plate to England . That 's where all the gold plate goes . DONNA LISA Montalvo ! CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Donna Lisa ! Am I welcome ? Rises . DONNA LISA Need you ask ? We were fearful for you . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO I had my misgivings about this house , Donna Lisa , but you seem to have been fortunate . You are at the center of the storm and therefore undisturbed . DONNA LISA We are involuntary headquarters , Seor Montalvo . Be quick with breakfast , Carmencita . Captain Morgan will no doubt leave early . Oh , and there is something on the floor here . Will you call the slaves to take it away ? p. 50 CARMENCITA The slaves have vanished , Donna Lisa . DONNA LISA This is hardly an object for the breakfast room . MARIA enters with a tray of food as MORGAN descends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Captain Morgan . MORGAN bows . May I make you acquainted with a friend , Seor Don Manuel Montalvo ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Most happy , sir . What 's this ? CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO My doing , Captain . I caught him at the chest . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Ah , yes . Quite right . I know the rascal . He stirs the body with a foot . To MONTALVO : Will you take his heels , sir ? They carry the sailor out at the back . MARIA and CARMENCITA busy themselves with the arrangement of the table . DONNA LISA You slept well , Carmencita ? CARMENCITA Perfectly . DONNA LISA And you , Maria ? CARMENCITA Yes , Maria , did you sleep well ? MARIA Beautifully , little one , beautifully . CARMENCITA gives MARIA the lie with a look . MORGAN and MONTALVO reenter. p. 51 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I regret this little annoyance , my lady . And yet I 'm very glad you 've disposed of him , sir . MORGAN seats himself behind the table . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done the same to you if I 'd had the chance . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN And what Spanish gentleman would not , Seor ? You need not explain . DONNA LISA Your place is here , Montalvo . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO standing . Thank you . I never breakfast with pirates . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN But I am no pirate . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO I must contradict you , Captain Morgan . You are . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN We are guests here , my friend , and I take no offense . Nevertheless , I am no pirate , but a commissioned officer in the navy of his gracious majesty , Charles II , save his Grace . I would have you remember that . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO standing . And if you think you are no pirate , I would have you look about you at this city when you have breakfasted , Captain Morgan . I think it will convince you to the contrary . p. 52 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You are young . The difference between war and piracy is legal , not actual . One captured city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assault is ordered . CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Does the king get all my gold plate  --  or do you ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Did all the gold plate go to the king when you Spaniards sacked Algiers ? DON JACINTO ESMERALDO appears at the head of the stairs , white as a sheet and walking with difficulty . MONTALVO and CARMENCITA run to assist him . He comes with them to the foot of the stairs . MORGAN rises . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO So you break bread with him and serve him with your own hands . You are for the winning side , I see . MONTALVO goes upstairs . It is like a woman , to throw herself in the way of the conqueror . You and I shall never break bread together again . I am not conquered . I have still some blood in me . False of heart , faint of courage , go with your race . Go back to your English . Betray them as you have betrayed our city . You were not frightened ? No  --  you knew you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can still draw a sword  --  He attempts to unsheathe his weapon and falls back into the arms of MONTALVO and CARMENCITA. p. 53 CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO Let me take him . DONNA LISA Here , Maria , my smelling salts ! He is ill . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN rises . No , not ill , madame . Wounded . DONNA LISA How wounded ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Not badly , though he lost blood . He will recover . DONNA LISA No , but by whom ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I must take the blame for that . He came to my room in the night . DONNA LISA starting upstairs . Why had I not heard of this ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN It 's nothing , Donna Lisa . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO Nothing , no , not this time . But it shall be something before I end . DONNA LISA Montalvo , will you help him to his bed ? To MORGAN . You must pardon us . MORGAN bows . MONTALVO , assisted by CARMENCITA , carries ESMERALDO up . DONNA LISA follows . MARIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her across the rail . MARIA Take care they do n't see . p. 54 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN They 've gone . Do you love me ? MARIA Too much . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Impossible . MARIA Too much , for you will go away and what will become of me ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN lightly . What will become of you ? Why , darling , what will become of me ? Think of me , my dear Maria , sailing lonely over the Spanish Main , longing always for my little Maria and walking up to death gladly at last because I do n't know where to find her . MARIA I think you 're very cheerful about it . And we 'll never see each other again  --  CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN That 's the loveliest thing about it . That 's what makes it perfect . MARIA Not seeing me again ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Not growing tired of you . Would n't you rather wait for me eternally than see me so often you grew tired of me ? MARIA When you say that you are tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how much of Panama there is left to sack , Maria . I do n't know whether I shall be here or ten leagues from here this evening but if I am here  --  wait for me. p. 55 MARIA And if you are not here ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN If I am not  --  why  --  just wait for me . Will you ? MARIA Yes . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN And now be a good girl and kiss me once more and run upstairs . There 's some one coming . MARIA kissing him . This evening  --  CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Good-bye . She runs upstairs , passing CARMENCITA . CARMENCITA What were you saying to Maria ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN What is the first maxim of a gentleman ? CARMENCITA You mean to tell me you were saying to Maria , " What is the first maxim of a gentleman " ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN The first maxim of a gentleman is , never discuss one woman with another . CARMENCITA It seems that you and Maria get along very well together . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could you say about me ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN About your flashing eyes , your rose-sweet mouth p. 56 CARMENCITA I do n't believe you . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN But make an effort to believe it , darling ! Make an effort ! You are n't trying ! Is this affair to be entirely on my side ? CARMENCITA You flatter yourself , sir . So far there is no affair . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN And do you think we two could part without so much as an affair , my dear ? You underestimate us both . Come , kiss me ! They kiss . This evening , in the patio , little Carmen . At moonrise . Kiss me again . Quick ! There 's some one coming . They kiss again . They hear footsteps above and separate . DONNA LISA appears at the stairhead . DONNA LISA Carmencita ! CARMENCITA Yes , Donna Lisa . To MORGAN : This evening ! CARMENCITA runs upstairs , passing DONNA LISA , who descends to MORGAN . She bends toward him in an instant , then withdraws . DONNA LISA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under our roof , Captain Morgan . I realize that your code authorizes summary vengeance in such cases . We owe our lives to your forbearance . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN approaching her . My dear Donna Lisa  --  p. 57 DONNA LISA You forget yourself , sir . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN True , true ! But as you know , I have fallen in love with you , violently and disastrously , and if it becomes noticeable you must forgive me . DONNA LISA Must I listen to that sort of thing at breakfast also ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I am not one of your cuckoo-clock gallants that spend the morning at his toilet , the middle of the day in siesta , the afternoon gaming , and the evening with his mistress . I make love when I ca n't help it  --  and if it happens to be at breakfast , why not ? DONNA LISA Because it bores me if that matters . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You are posing , my lady ; posing elegantly and with skill , but posing . No woman was ever bored with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LISA Oh , you little know  --  CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You may have been bored with that walking stick they have carried upstairs . DONNA LISA she rises and walks about . Oh , a woman is the most unfortunate thing ! CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN What woman ? DONNA LISA Any woman ! A man can do as he pleases , but a woman can do nothing but accept compliments until she is so sick of them , she marries to escape . p. 58 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I gather you have led a melancholy existence ? Nothing but one man after another . DONNA LISA Nothing but one man after another . Sitting again . First in England , when I grew tired of dancing at country parties , my relatives must needs push me into a match ; and in Panama City , when I became a widow , my friends will have it that my situation requires an alliance . And no sooner is that alliance broken off , than the very free-booter I put up for the night thrusts his attentions on me . You think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man  --  some man any man . Is not the world as wide for one sex as the other ? I came to Panama City for adventure CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN And you call this no adventure ? Sitting near her . DONNA LISA Single , married , or widowed , in England or the Caribbean , among enemies or among friends , still a woman may take part in nothing but courtship and domesticity . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Your own fault , I assure you . DONNA LISA Mine ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I tried marriage a while , though you would n't think it . Very pleasant it is back in Wales with the mountains turning gold in autumn and green in spring . A man comes home peacefully every night but Saturday , kisses his decent little wife a frugal little kiss , and before he knows it , he 's dead and done for . That 's domesticity for you . I decided that I did n't want to die that way . I took ship . p. 59 DONNA LISA It sounds so easy ! You took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail away and keep on going ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Nothing to prevent you . DONNA LISA Everything . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Nothing except that you 're frightened to death of your precious virtue . Forget that and you can do as you please . DONNA LISA You do as you please and keep your reputation . You even win reputation by it . Suppose I forget my virtue , where would my reputation be ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You must lose your reputation for virtue before you can gain a reputation for anything else , dear lady . All men have lost their reputations for virtue . That 's the first thing they do . Then they can start . Not before . DONNA LISA Not all men . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN No ! Not all . But all that count . All that get more out of life than a housewife gets . DONNA LISA But to take an instance . Could any woman make a place for herself in your company ? You know better . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN It depends on the woman . You could  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 60 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You have presence , a good head in emergencies ; you 'd command respect . DONNA LISA Among pirates ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I 'd not advise piracy . I 've never gone in for it myself . DONNA LISA No , I forgot . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Call it privateering . Of course you 'd have to go into it head over heels , forget everything else , use your influence as a woman as I use mine as a man , play your officers against each other , distribute favors , build up a name for courage , charm your mates , put your men in their places you 'd know how when you got there  --  DONNA LISA Oh  --  CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN rising . If you want life you can have it . There 's plenty of it lying around . Rises and goes to her . Of course you might get too much of it before you were through , with men killing each other for you every week or two . Still DONNA LISA And I might be killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any time . And as for losing your virtue , you simply would n't have any . DONNA LISA In a way , that might be a relief . p. 61 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Oh , it is . DONNA LISA still seated . It 's almost attractive . And  --  although I would n't enlist with you , remember  --  what , if I were going to enlist , would you have me do first ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Love me . DONNA LISA rising , turns away from him . So it was only courtship again ! CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Courtship if you will , madonna , but not domesticity . To love most men is domesticity ; to love me is an adventure . I offer you no hacienda among the foothills , no cottage by the sea . I offer only arms that are more familiar with tiller and sword than with soft encounters . DONNA LISA Why do you choose to tell this tale to me ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN going to her . I 'll tell you that when you tell me what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that door last night , madonna . We knew then , quite as well as we know now , what this would come to . I knew I must have you . Something it is of the mind , something of the body  --  swift as tropic lightning , not to be explained . DONNA LISA No , no ! You are wrong . p. 62 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You are wrong to trifle . GEORGE enters from the right . GEORGE CASTLE Whenever you 're at leisure , Captain Morgan . Your pardon , lady . Those ships , sir . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN What ships ? GEORGE CASTLE standing at the door . There are three English ships in the harbor that were n't there last night . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Our own ? GEORGE CASTLE No . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Then what ships ? GEORGE CASTLE Commodore Wright 's fleet . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Now may he rot in his own scuppers , the dirty hound ! I thought you said he was three hundred miles south ? GEORGE CASTLE So it was reported , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORGAN Damn them , damn their eyes ; damn them blind , and you too , you bungling , headless total loss ! Have you no other excuse ? GEORGE CASTLE None , sir . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Have they sent boats ashore ? p. 63 GEORGE CASTLE One , sir . The commodore 's on shore looking for you . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN It 's damned early for a commodore . GEORGE CASTLE I gave him considerable misinformation as to where you were . We aim to lose him and keep him lost till we 've had time to get the stuff together . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN He wo n't find this place ? GEORGE CASTLE He 's looking under the wharves for you along the water-front . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I suppose several of them followed you here ? GEORGE CASTLE No , I judge you 're safe on this side of town . DONNA LISA But who is this ? Comes down between them . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Commodore Wright of his Majesty 's navy , who 's been chasing me around the Caribbean for the last half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what have you done ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Nothing but serve the king . Nothing but take Porto Bello for him from the Spanish . But there is a pan-handling clique about the king , a mangy pack of dogs-in-the-manger that will neither do anything themselves nor suffer others . They 've proved to him by some chancery legerdemain or other that my captain 's commission gives me no sanction for land actions . Hence the warrant ; hence my own ship dragging anchor somewhere off the coast , unable to enter and transport spoils . And to please these cosmetic browsers and lip-stick suckers I and my men must now find our way back overland with what little we carry . p. 64 GEORGE CASTLE We go back overland ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Yes . Cache all valuables at the church . Get together enough food and water for a three-day march . GEORGE starts to go out by a small , concealed door at the right . You 'd better not go out the same way you came in . Is n't there a rear exit ? DONNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , and no one will see him leave the house . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN And if there are any back alleys in this town , use them . GEORGE goes . So I 've lost Panama . DONNA LISA I 'm sorry . I do n't know why  --  and it 's silly of me  --  but one always takes sides . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You could make up for it . No one else . DONNA LISA Tell me how ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Come with me . DONNA LISA But you must know that 's out of the question . Where are you going ? What would become of me ? Three days through the jungle  --  CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Wear dancing slippers if you like . Your feet wo n't touch the ground till we 've reached the anchorage . But come . p. 65 DONNA LISA And never see England again ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Never step another minuet  --  never bow to another dowager  --  never listen to the addresses of another perfumed fop  --  set your teeth into life  --  be the first woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many things . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You want nothing that you ca n't take for yourself . DONNA LISA What I can have  --  is England . What I want I have no idea . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN But I know what I want and know what you want . You want escape , and I offer it . DONNA LISA It 's easy to talk of these things . But to do them Walking toward the window . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN needs only courage . Following her . DONNA LISA Oh , if I had the courage ! If I had longer to think about it  --  CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You 'd play safe , of course . Now you know why in England or in the Caribbean there 's nothing for a woman but domesticity . They 're afraid . All afraid . Even you , who met and turned me so easily last night , even you who know how to play a new game and invent the rules as you go  --  you are afraid . You 'd rather a minute at a time , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . Is it true ? p. 66 DONNA LISA It may be . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Ca n't you for once be different from the others ? Looking into her eyes . DONNA LISA You 're right , I 'm afraid ! MARIA appearing at the head of the stairs . A romantic scene of a bright spring morning ! The birds mating in the trees ! The pirate making love to the lady of the house ! Most delicate and touching ! CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN It 's only farewell , Maria . I 've had bad news . Ten to one I sha n't be here again . MARIA Oh ! CARMENCITA follows her down the stairway . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Would you give me your hand in such a case ? MARIA No ! No Running to his arms . Good-bye . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Be happy and live long . CARMENCITA Will you tell my fortune too ? Approaching him . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN kissing her . May you never have a lover with arms weaker than your own . p. 67 CARMENCITA Odious ! CAPTAIN HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LISA not answering him . Carmencita , will you show him the way ? MORGAN and CARMENCITA go out by the door at the right . MARIA goes to the window . DONNA LISA You appear to have been deeply affected by Captain Morgan 's threat of departure . Console yourself , my dear . Unless I gauge him incorrectly , he is returning . MARIA I know . DONNA LISA Yes ? Turning toward her . You also have an instinct for these matters . No doubt you will find opportunity for further parley with the gentleman . I shall be at pains to leave the field clear for you . MARIA You are very kind . It will not be necessary . DONNA LISA But to further your happiness , my dear , I would do anything within reason , or even beyond . MARIA You think yourself very clever , Donna Lisa . Well , you 're not as clever as you think . A VOICE outside the street door . Captain Morgan 's headquarters ? p. 68 DONNA LISA No . Your business , sir ? THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DONNA LISA steps back , and an ensign of the king 's navy appears . ENSIGN I 'm looking for Captain Morgan , ma'am . DONNA LISA Captain Morgan is not here . MONTALVO and ESMERALDO appear at the head of the stairs . ENSIGN He 's been here ? DONNA LISA Before I answer your questions , may I ask who you are ? ENSIGN Why , you see , I 'm his Britannic Majesty 's ensign . I 'm glad you speak English . It makes it easier , and it 's very embarrassing , breaking in this way . You see , I have a word for Captain Morgan 's ear , and if he 's been annoying you , why you may be glad to learn that Commodore Wright has a warrant for his arrest . Now , if you could tell me where he is DONNA LISA I 'm afraid I ca n't . ENSIGN I do n't doubt your word , you see  --  but the officer who just came in that was n't Captain Morgan ? DONNA LISA No . ENSIGN And you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DONNA LISA I can tell you nothing . ENSIGN Thank you very much . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO And why not ? You had breakfast with him , if I 'm not mistaken . Starting down the stairs . ENSIGN Then Captain Morgan has been here , ma'am ? DONNA LISA He has made this house his headquarters . ENSIGN Against your wishes , I 'm sure , ma'am . Now , if you could tell me when he 's likely to be back , we could relieve you of him , and I dare say we 'd be happier . He 'll be here again ? DONNA LISA I think not . ENSIGN Could you tell me where we might find him ? DONNA LISA I have no idea . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO descending with MONTALVO . Why , yes , betray your king as well as your household ! Run up the pirate 's colors on the tower ! I wronged you , my lady , when I accused you of siding with the English ! It 's your buccaneer ! Sir , this house not only has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He not only has been here , he has been made welcome here , trebly welcome , and he will be here again ! He may be here now ! p. 70 CAPTAIN MANUEL MONTALVO I was about to suggest that if this young man wishes to find Captain Morgan it would be a good plan to search the house . Coming downstairs . DONNA LISA Yes , by all means . ENSIGN Well , now , I doubt that I ought to try it alone . However , I 'm greatly obliged by the information , and we 'll throw a guard about the place at once , begging your pardon , ma'am . DONNA LISA Oh , I 'm sure a guard would be an excellent device . ENSIGN Yes , ma'am . You see , that way we 'll get him either going or coming . DONNA LISA You think of everything . ENSIGN You see , I 've studied tactics , ma'am . DONNA LISA I might have known . DON JACINTO DE ESMERALDO at the door . Come , Montalvo . There are too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowing . I thank you for your courtesy , ma'am . DONNA LISA Your own courtesy , sir , is like your tactics : irreproachable . ENSIGN Thank you , ma'am . He starts for the door. p. 71 DONNA LISA I wonder if I might ask a favor of you ? ENSIGN Why , surely . DONNA LISA I have been more or less stranded in Panama City since the death of my husband , and being English , I find my position growing more intolerable from day to day . If Commodore Wright could arrange passage for me back to England , I should be more than grateful . Do you think it could be managed ? ENSIGN Well , now , I doubt it , ma'am . The commodore will be here in a few moments , ma'am . And he will answer for himself . He comes back to her . Of course , if you could help us to lay hands on Captain Morgan , I doubt if there would be any difficulty about that passage to England . DONNA LISA Again , I must compliment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , ma'am . He goes . DONNA LISA Carmencita ! CARMENCITA enters . Carmencita , run at once to the church and find Captain Morgan . Tell him this house is watched and he must not return . CARMENCITA This house  --  DONNA LISA No questions ! Quick ! As CARMENCITA turns to go she meets MORGAN in the doorway . She glances at DONNA LISA and runs out quickly. p. 72 DONNA LISA Oh , you here ! I have just sent Carmencita to warn you . The commodore 's ensign has been here . They are throwing a guard about the house . MORGAN walks toward the window . Do n't go to the window . They 're there now . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You sent to warn me ? DONNA LISA Yes . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Thank you . DONNA LISA How did you enter ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I did not leave , my dear . I have been walking in the patio , trying to make up my mind to leave you . DONNA LISA If you stay longer the commodore will find you here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we shall remember each other kindly , and perhaps with some regret ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Would it not be better to remember each other kindly without regret ? We are met by chance at a far corner of the earth and in a far corner of an obscure century . It is unlikely that we meet again . We are still young , or young enough ; but we shall not be young forever . And when my bones lie white in the sunlight somewhere between Mexico and Peru , and when your hands and lips are dust in an English churchyard , would it not be better that we had taken what we wanted of each other and gone away singing ? p. 73 DONNA LISA You speak well and poetically on the most incredible subjects , Captain Morgan . What more can a man desire when he knows himself master of such magnificent rhetoric ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Ay , you can mock , Donna Lisa , but that 's no answer . DONNA LISA What answer could I make you in the morning sunlight ? CAPTAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The town is no longer mine , but tonight the Caribbean is yours and mine . DONNA LISA I fear you need the moon for such an overture ; for by day , I hope you realize , it is a most immoral proposal . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Quite immoral and reckless , dear Donna Lisa . DONNA LISA Surely there are others in the city who could find it in their hearts to love for a night the conqueror of Panama ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN And after seeing you  --  with you in my mind  --  do you think I should want them ? And are you proud , after all , of the comparison ? It is you that I love . He lays a hand on her shoulder . I can stay but a moment longer . You will come ? DONNA LISA pausing . Yes . They embrace and kiss . Let 's steal one night out of eternity . But on one condition p. 74 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN It 's too late for conditions , sweet . He kisses her again . DONNA LISA That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . That we love while we can , and part when we must , without pretending . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I shall never need to pretend . He kisses her again . DONNA LISA in utter surrender . If I take you , it is because you are real , too real to perjure yourself to save my pride . You will love me a little while , and I shall love you a little while and when it 's gone that 's the end . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN When you start to argue I must stop you thus , with a kiss , for you are better at it than I am . There has never been another girl like you . There never will be . No conditions . DONNA LISA No squabbling , no complaints , no recriminations when it 's over . Only this day CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Very well . This day , and forever  --  and then another day . DONNA LISA Yes . Yes to you . They melt into each other 's arms . Have your way always . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DONNA LISA Oh , it was true , what you said ! CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN What was true ? DONNA LISA When you came in that door , I knew . But I had to try you . Did you mind ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You marvelous woman ! Mind ! In embracing him she touches the wound in his shoulder , and he flinches slightly . DONNA LISA I 've hurt you ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Only this scratch . DONNA LISA Does it trouble you much ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Not at all . DONNA LISA And is it well bandaged ? Who did it ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Maria . DONNA LISA Maria 's a precious child . I thank her for it . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You can thank her for saving me from worse . DONNA LISA From worse ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Yes . Realizing the slip . DONNA LISA She warned you ? CARMENCITA enters at the rear p. 76 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Yes . DONNA LISA breaking away . But where was she ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I think , by accident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ! CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN No DONNA LISA I might have guessed when she flashed out at me and ran upstairs . It 's well I learned in time . And it was I who believed you cared nothing for these others after you had seen me . Catching sight of CARMENCITA . And no doubt Carmencita is one of your light-o ' - loves . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN What has all this got to do with us ? DONNA LISA Carmencita ! CARMENCITA Yes . DONNA LISA Was Maria with Captain Morgan last night ? CARMENCITA You have n't been without considerable competition , Donna Lisa , if I do say it . DONNA LISA Then you , too , I dare say CARMENCITA When you are quite through with him , seora mia , you might remind him of a rather particular appointment for this evening by moonlight . p. 77 DONNA LISA With you ? Oh , you are welcome . CARMENCITA going out . No hurry , I 'm sure . DONNA LISA You dared , you dared , to make me a laughingstock to my whole household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! With a cry of hatred , DONNA LISA rushes at him and begins to beat him savagely in the face with both fists , not so much a woman 's blows as a man 's . You scoundrel , you liar , you cheap knave ! Liar ! Liar ! CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN laughing under the blows . Now I know you love me . DONNA LISA renewing the attack . You , coming to me with your sighs of eternal love ! Your free life ! Liar and knave ! Debaucher , thief , with the morals of a dog-pound . I 'll kill you ! I 'll fix your lying face so no other woman will ever believe you so all other women will find my scars there , and know that they were made by a woman who did not believe your lying . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Ho ! Ho ! Only half warding off her blows and laughing uproariously . Who would have thought the woman had so much fire in her ? What a pair we 'll make together , you and I ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet , your fury . Hit me again ! p. 78 DONNA LISA still beating . What a pair we shall make ! You tap-room seducer . You raping cutpurse catchpenny of a tin-soldier ! Do you think I 'd go with you farther than I could find pretense to kill you ? Do you think we shall ever pair together ? That I shall mate with such a vulture as you ? You twisted , lying old goat-face of a brothel master ! CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN catching her hands . With none other . Only your pride is hurt now . DONNA LISA struggling . Let me go . Let me go , and I 'll kill you . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Enough , my pretty one . Enough . Do n't struggle so . I let you go , after all this sweet fury ? Why , I shall carry you off to the ends of the world now ! DONNA LISA furiously , almost breaking away . You coward and bully ! You clown who thinks himself a lover ! CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN picking her up and starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you off now , precious dove . No more ruffling your feathers . DONNA LISA breaking away . And you 'll be carried into the flames of hell . Running to the window and giving a signal . Morgan 's here ! Morgan 's here ! Turning on him . I 've given you over to the commodore and he 'll hang you up by your ugly neck until your lecherous eyes start from your lying face , you coward and bully and upstart of a tavern romance ! p. 79 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN rushing after her and picking her up again . If the commodore fools with me I 'll feed his guts to the sharks , my little white porpoise ! Let them try to take me  --  let them try to take you from me . The door flies open and COMMODORE WRIGHT , a pompous sailor , bursts in with the ENSIGN and boat 's crew . Hell , guts and molasses ! He drops her and runs to the base of the stairway , setting his back against it and whipping forth two blunderbusses . Stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be maggoty before another tropic day is past . ENSIGN Captain Morgan ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN At your service , Jack man . ENSIGN Stand attention . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN whirling and then louting with his hat . An English commodore at Panama City . Now , that is odd , by God it is ! How come you here , who could not take it in seven years of planning ? Did you take the Spanish by surprise ? No . You did n't take it . Come to think of it , I took it . And now , I suppose , you have come to offer me your commission , to tear off those epaulets of yours and give them to a better man . COMMODORE WRIGHT I arrest you in the king 's name , Captain Morgan , for exceeding your commission on the high seas . p. 80 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Why , yes  --  arrest me . Arrest me when you can , and I wish you joy of me before you 're done . COMMODORE WRIGHT Before you 're done , let us say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knots of it under your ear , while you dance on the thin air of the Execution Dock . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Swing me ? What ingratitude ! Here , by my kind permission , you walk the streets of the richest city in the Indies . But perhaps you 'd like to hang me to close my mouth , lest I tell that you did not take for yourself the city where you now draw warrants signed by your silly king . COMMODORE WRIGHT Shall I put you in irons , Captain Morgan , or will you come peaceably ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Come where , milord ? COMMODORE WRIGHT To ship with me , and then to England . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I do n't like the climate of England . Some other time , milord , some other time . COMMODORE WRIGHT No other time . This warrant charges you with acts exceeding your commission . If you will not subscribe to it , we shall be charged to change your offense to robbery and piracy . For by resisting the king 's arrest , you subscribe yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must choose between piracy and surrender . MORGAN frets . Come , I am not a patient man . p. 81 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Nor I. He turns to DONNA LISA . Lady , did I not tell you that a man must take what he will , and be damned to all the world ? Unless this royal governess ordered me , it was unpatriotic for me to be the scourge of Spain . I have exceeded my commission . He turns upon WRIGHT . Take care , sir , that I do not exceed it so far that you will never have use for yours again . COMMODORE WRIGHT And supposing you were successful ? You know that ten others would begin where I left off , and in the end , older perhaps and somewhat more grizzled and worn , you would still have that dance on thin air from eighteen feet of cord . Morgan , there are those in this service who admire your seamanship , though none envy your reputation . Are you not man enough to face a court and begin again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rim o ' the world , scorned by such women as this lovely creature here ? Look at her ; look at you . Can you stand there and know her contempt for you and not wish to be a more honorable man ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I may live to be honored . I may even live to be a hundred years old . But God save me from talking like a commodore ! He turns toward the door , brushing aside two sailors . At a signal from the commodore , a third sailor leaps on his back from the stairs . There is instantly a heap of struggling men on the floor . MARIA and CARMENCITA enter from above. p. 82 DONNA LISA Do n't let him get away ! COMMODORE WRIGHT Quickly , men ! MORGAN rises , but the men cling to him like burs . They spreadeagle MORGAN on the floor DONNA LISA leaping to her feet . Dog  --  dog ! She kicks him . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Madam , madam ! May not a fallen but faithful lover kiss your hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan . There is no other way . You will face charges greater than those I brought . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN How do I know you 're all you pretend to be ? Have I seen your damned warrant with your pimping king 's seal ? Am I answerable for every popinjay who boasts a cocked hat ? Serve your warrant , and if I then judge it genuine , I may submit . But take these verminous dogs off my neck . COMMODORE WRIGHT Carry him to the brig . And you , lady ? DONNA LISA to MORGAN . I hate you ! I hate you ! CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN throwing off the sailors . Oh , darling , I love you , I love you ! p. 83 DONNA LISA I hate you , I hate you ! CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN as they catch his arms . Ho , ho , she hates me ! How she hates me ! I tell you , you love me  --  you love me  --  DONNA LISA You beast ! Oh , you beast ! Half hysterical . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Whitehall . CHARLES II sits on a bench in the center of the room . A councilor is standing before him , reading a long-winded document to which the roomful of courtiers , naval officers , and ladies  --  for MORGAN is under fire , and DONNA LISA is materially concerned  --  pay various degrees of inattention . THE COUNCILOR It being further attested that the said Henry Morgan , being at that time commissioned a private captain in the navy of his Majesty , Charles II of England , did attack , seize , and loot the city of Porto Bello , the said city being at that time in the possession of the king of Spain , and did lay waste , loot , and burn churches , treasure- houses , and individual domiciles , parceling the loot among his men , without royal warrant permitting an extension of his sea-commission to actions against the organized enemy ashore  --  CHARLES My God , stop it ! That 's enough . You swear to that , Commodore ? COMMODORE WRIGHT I do , sire . CHARLES What had you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WRIGHT Why , I 'd never laid eyes on him personally , sire , but in obedience to your Majesty 's commission I tracked him from Porto Bello to Panama City  --  a trail of robbery , arson and bloodshed . We found Porto Bello looted of treasure . We found Panama City sacked and ruined . On the high seas between the two we encountered four Spanish ships gutted by this marauder . We took him in the very act of carrying off a woman ! p. 85 CHARLES You have the good name of the navy at heart , Commodore . What would you say was necessary to clear it of blame in this matter ? COMMODORE WRIGHT To clear the navy , sire , and the kingdom , it will be necessary to hang him , and to publish his crimes . CHARLES Come , come ! Have you no milder method ? Name the minimum which would satisfy honor . COMMODORE WRIGHT He defied and resisted the king 's officer , your Majesty . He is a notorious criminal . His record blots the whole history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the minimum . CHARLES But would you not be inclined to admit , Commodore , that he has been useful , and in some instances practically indispensable , to the sea power of the kingdom ? COMMODORE WRIGHT Your Majesty , it were better to swallow a hundred years ' defeat than to recognize a pirate 's victory . CHARLES You would rather be virtuous than victorious ? COMMODORE WRIGHT If that is the alternative , your Majesty . CHARLES Very well , sir ; you have spoken . And now , Captain Morgan you exceeded your commission in the taking of Porto Bello ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I took Porto Bello by a very plausible extension of my commission which any judge on your bench could legalize in five minutes . p. 86 CHARLES Oh , as to that , any judge on any bench could legalize any crime in five minutes . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Then let them legalize it . CHARLES We are met here to determine that . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Has it occurred to your Majesty that if England has no use for Porto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My seafaring friend , in the international game of snatch , cities are taken but never returned . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Then , your Majesty , since you are to hang me for taking Porto Bello , why should n't you hang yourself for keeping it ? COMMODORE WRIGHT Your Majesty , will you listen to this ? CHARLES I am conducting a hearing , Commodore . It is my business to listen . You suggest hanging Captain Morgan . Captain Morgan suggests hanging me . No offense , of course . All in good part , I 'm sure . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Quite , your Majesty , quite . COMMODORE WRIGHT Sire , when we found Captain Morgan at Panama City he flung himself upon my officer , delivered himself of abusive language , mocked at the authority of the Crown and made light of your Majesty 's warrant . His conduct on that one occasion proves him a pirate in act and belief ! p. 87 CHARLES Answer , my buccaneer . Talk yourself out of that . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Your Majesty , the officers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not seamen , and the seamen are not gentlemen . The British navy used to be feared without being much respected . If our commodore here has his way , it will end by being respected but not much feared . I am accused of taking Porto Bello and Panama City without legal sanction . So much the better for you , for if you were to take them legally you 'd have to declare a costly war on Spain . I am accused of pocketing the loot and distributing it among my men . I did pocket it . The laborer is worthy of his hire . I offer you two Caribbean ports in exchange . COMMODORE WRIGHT He offers a robber 's title to stolen goods , sire . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN A robber 's title ! As if we were n't all robbers and thieves ! As if there was an acre of land owned in Europe , to say nothing of the New World , that was n't founded on a robber 's title ! As if there was a port in England that did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish trade ! I 've lived up to your law a thousand times closer than these foxy gentlemen who live near enough the courts to buy them when they need them ! They sit at home and distract and gouge and burrow under those who are bold enough to strike out for the king ! p. 88 CHARLES True , Captain , quite true ; but one of these inadmissible truths . If we were to admit all this publicly , you know very well the kingdom would go to the devil . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Why , then , at least act on it , sire . Let me go back to the Caribbean and finish my job in the king 's name , or in God 's name hang me . He turns . CHARLES Another moment of your time , if you can spare it , Captain . There 's one more charge against you . To the COUNCILOR . Can you find that passage concerning Lady Elizabeth Neville ? THE COUNCILOR reading . Upon which , deponent sayeth that Captain Morgan did wilfully and violently attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those present and chiefly to the king 's officer . And further , deponent sayeth that  --  CHARLES Enough . Where is this king 's officer ? ENSIGN Here , sire . CHARLES You attest this ? ENSIGN Yes , sire . CHARLES You recognize the incident , Lady Elizabeth ? DONNA LISA In the main , sire . p. 89 CHARLES Do you wish to bring an indictment ? DONNA LISA No , your Majesty . Captain Morgan is already under indictment for piracy and in a fair way to be hanged . That should serve . CHARLES But you accuse the Captain of this crime ? DONNA LISA It is true that he attempted to carry me away . It is also true I had planned to go with him  --  and would have gone had not a certain matter come to light . CHARLES That would seem to palliate the offence . DONNA LISA Yes , sire . CHARLES And this certain matter  --  if I may ask  --  what was that ? DONNA LISA embarrassed . It is of no moment , sire . CHARLES But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my maids-in-waiting . CHARLES And what was your attitude toward this , my dear ? DONNA LISA I resented it . MORGAN smiles . CHARLES smiles at him . CHARLES I understand . Monsieur of the Council , you may blot that paragraph of the record dealing with Lady Elizabeth . And I believe this concludes our session . Captain Morgan , it appears that I shall be obliged to remand you for execution . The audience is at an end . The witnesses may retire . The prisoners remain . All but MORGAN go out . Morgan , I 've put off this hearing six months in hopes these sea pirates at the Admiralty would forget you , but , damme ! they still insist on hanging you . What am I to do ? I ca n't hang you to satisfy the honor of these petticoat admirals and placket commodores . You 've done more to rid the sea of our enemies than all of them put together . p. 90 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN May I venture a suggestion , your Majesty ? KING That 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to how I am to hang you without killing you . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Why , my advice is this , Majesty . If you do n't want to hang me , did you ever think of hanging them instead ? KING You would n't want me to hang that pretty widow . Tell me , Morgan , what have you done to this lady that she blushes when she looks at you ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I captured Panama , sire . CHARLES I 'll warrant . And what else did you capture ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Porto Bello , Majesty . CHARLES So you wo n't boast of your light-o ' - loves ! Damme , you 're a rum sort of seadog . Not an admiral in my fleet that does n't come homing from the isthmus with a chart of lies about the Spanish women and the Indians he 's charmed . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I never tell tales , Majesty . CHARLES Not even at royal command ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Sire , I could tell a hundred better than you ever heard from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I were to talk of such matters I 'd begin to feel downright sorry that I 'm to be hanged . p. 91 CHARLES But this pretty widow , what did you do that makes her so skittish when you 're around ? You must have a method worth knowing . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Before God , Majesty , I did nothing . CHARLES You did n't try ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I did , sire , but I made one great mistake . I fell in love with her . CHARLES I see . And it made you seem insincere . Damn the creatures ! CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN And so I remained a moment too long in Panama City , and your Majesty 's commodore caught and sacked me , and your Majesty 's hangmen will stretch my neck . I was always a devotee of beauty , and now I 'm a martyr to it . CHARLES Damme , Captain , I hate to see a good seaman hanged over a wench ! They are n't worth it . I hate ' em all , this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near being worth it . CHARLES You should have stuck to buccaneering , Captain , and let the women alone . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Majesty , as a lover I 've lost my good opinion of myself . CHARLES And as an admiral , now ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN As an admiral , Majesty , I 'm still a man of genius . p. 92 CHARLES Tell me , Morgan , do you ever find much trouble beating these Spaniards ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN There 's no trouble giving them the actual beating . It 's my commission hampers me . I chase ' em ashore , and they get away . CHARLES Morgan , why could n't you serve me if I sent you out to catch the tide with the commodore 's fleet tonight ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Under that silver-hooped barrel of ship 's grease ? No man could serve you well under that , sire . CHARLES Damme , Morgan , you 're a problem to me . I ca n't stand you , because you 're needed . If I reward you , I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't sail under him , sire . He 's no seaman . CHARLES Well , then , if I sent you in command , could you teach him seamanship ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN In command over the commodore ? CHARLES Ay , over the commodore . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN By God , I 'd either teach him or wear out a rope 's end on him ! CHARLES Then take him , Morgan . Take his fleet , and take him with you . He 's been underfoot around here for six months , ever since he brought you back , and we 're all sick of him . Take him along and make him jump overboard in that iron shirt he wears . A HERALD enters with a robe. p. 93 HERALD Sire  --  CHARLES I 've got to give the accolade to three duns this afternoon . What a life , Morgan ! There are three note-shavers to be knighted at four o ' the clock , in a room that 's colder than the hinges of hell , and the most I know of any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his robe . And then I 've got to sit like a mummy for three quarters of an hour afterward , talking to the ugliest lot of royal females that ever wore a farthingale . Come in with me , Morgan . I always feel better when I can see one more man in the room . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN In this uniform , Majesty ? And if I 'm commanding the fleet I 'll need two or three hours before sailing . CHARLES To bother the widow , eh ? He stops , reflecting . By the rod of Aaron , I 'll knight ye first ! ' Twill work wonders with the jade . They ca n't withstand the titles . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Sire , I beg leave to decline the honor . I 'd lose my grip on my men if I went back to the Caribbean a gentleman . CHARLES The devil take your declination ! I 'll knight you if I like . I 'll knight you , first because I like you , and second because it will anger these money-lenders to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother them ! I can hear them chatter . With a skull and cross-bones , gad ! He rises and goes to the door . Get ready for the ceremony , Morgan . And oh , yes , write me a confidential dispatch and tell me how the widow was affected . To the COUNCILOR . Tell them inside there 's been a slight change in plans , sir . We knight four instead of three . The COUNCILOR goes out . We 'll have a drink after the ceremony , Morgan ; and do n't forget that confidential dispatch . It 's important . p. 94 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I have n't authority to send a confidential dispatch , Majesty . CHARLES Oh , I forgot to tell you ! If you take Commodore Wright 's place you 'll be my deputy out in Jamaica  --  governor of Jamaica . I 'll send your papers to the ship . How 's that for authority over the widow ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Governor of Jamaica ! CHARLES Surely ! Jamaica ! Where the ginger comes from . He goes off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An antechamber . Through the door at the left it gives on the audience chamber . DONNA LISA and her ladies enter from the right , in something of a flutter . DONNA LISA Remember , you two must stand in front of me , especially if he comes through , so I wo n't be known . Thank heaven the court enters from the other wing ! I 'll sit here . Maria , spread your skirts for a screen . Moving back to the wall . Oh , my heaven , here come two of them now , dressed and trussed up , and God help us to escape ! MARIA moving with her . Is Morgan with them ? DONNA LISA Call him Henry , child . Having been intimate with the gentleman , you are entitled to dispense with formality . TOWNSHEND and SKIPWITH enter . JAMES TOWNSHEND Marmion not here at this late hour ? ELIPHALET SKIPWITH He is always late . It runs in the family . JAMES TOWNSHEND Ay , and has done ever since his mother was one year later than her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARMION enters . Cousin , we two were going in alone . p. 96 HENRY MARMION Alone ? Now by St. Dunstan 's clock , I doubt that I shall go in at all in the face of this insult ! Do you know what the king has done ? There is a fourth to be gartered with us  --  his name is Morgan , and he has just been taken from a dungeon underneath the Tower . JAMES TOWNSHEND A jailbird ? HENRY MARMION A jailbird ! Why , damme , a jailbird would be good company compared with this customer ! A brigand , a pirate , a murderer on the high seas , a villainous cutthroat who has been six months in the lower keep for mayhem and rape among the Caribbean isles . JAMES TOWNSHEND By any rule of common courtesy is it not an insult to be knighted in a buccaneer 's company ? HENRY MARMION with an eye on DONNA LISA 's group . Softly , softly ; we are overheard . Is there a lady to be gartered with us , I wonder ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , the ladies have garters to give ! They need no decorations from monarchs . HENRY MARMION to CARMENCITA . Your mistress hides her face . Am I correct in assuming that your mistress would not be spoken with ? DONNA LISA rising . Her mistress will speak for herself , sir , since you insist . We appear to be in the way ? p. 97 HENRY MARMION Oh , on the contrary ! DONNA LISA And what is your excuse for this parley ? HENRY MARMION Can you deny audience to a slave ? DONNA LISA Oh , I give you back your liberty without ransom , gentle warrior ! But on condition that you make use of it by running away . JAMES TOWNSHEND Dismissed , cousin , dismissed ! HENRY MARMION bowing . Still at your service  --  and adieu . DONNA LISA courtesying . Adieu , O flower of chivalry ! MARMION retreats in discomfiture . MORGAN enters from the right , and DONNA LISA is screened again . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Well , gentlemen , I understand we four are all in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkey of myself all alone . JAMES TOWNSHEND half turning . You are addressing  --  ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN You , sir , among others . JAMES TOWNSHEND Oh , I beg pardon . He turns back to MARMION . Had we concluded our arrangements , Cousin Marmion ? p. 98 HENRY MARMION You have elected yourself to take precedence , cousin . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN hail-fellow-well-met . Do I gather there 's an election with this affair ? JAMES TOWNSHEND to MARMION . Have you met the gentleman , cousin ? HENRY MARMION smoothly . This is Captain Morgan , I believe ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Right the first time , sir . HENRY MARMION Allow me to introduce myself , sir . One Marmion , a poor relation of the Marmions of Essex . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Most happy , I 'm sure . HENRY MARMION This gentleman here claims descent from the Townshends of Essex , Captain Morgan , and though there is no proving these matters , let us hope his mother was honest , for he bears the Townshend name . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Most happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his left , sir , you may identify him by the name of Skipwith , a name made glorious by some remote ancestor who skipped with something , perhaps with the contents of the king 's exchequer , perhaps with another man 's wife . At any rate , it is no matter , for this last scion has nothing to show for it but some acres of Kentish earth . p. 99 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Your most humble . He speaks truth , Sir Dolorous ? HENRY MARMION Oh , more , sir ; and then again , less . JAMES TOWNSHEND distantly , withdrawing a step . You will pardon us , Captain Morgan , if we continue our conference ? ELIPHALET SKIPWITH following . By your leave , sir . MARMION hesitates . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Why , before you go into silence , might a plain seaman ask a plain question ? HENRY MARMION Doubtless . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN It seems we are fated to be knighted together , worse luck , for I see you do n't like it any too well . But since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of study on these furbelows  --  is there much that I should know to avoid stumbling ? JAMES TOWNSHEND There is nothing , Captain , which should not come natural to a gentleman born . A pause . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN My birth , sir  --  JAMES TOWNSHEND Is not in question . You will excuse me ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Why , no , I wo n't . By God , there are men in Wales , my masters , with hats as high as your own  --  and parentage not so doubtful ! I tell you  --  p. 100 HENRY MARMION My cousin means no reflection on you , Captain Morgan , none in the world . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN As for you , young olives and vinegar , there 's too much oil on your tongue . You talk like so much French dressing . HENRY MARMION I have been known to talk to some purpose , Captain Morgan . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Not since I 've known you . When you choose your arms , take an eel rampant , with a yellow belly and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well paid , Marmion . You waste kindness on an understrapper . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I want none of your kindness . JAMES TOWNSHEND Oh , so we understand , sirrah . A remarkable specimen , would you say , Skipwith ? ELIPHALET SKIPWITH bored . Genus homo , peasant class , tavern manners . JAMES TOWNSHEND Voice loud , carriage braggart , language tending , one might say , toward the piratical . MORGAN lays a hand to his sword . Then , reconsidering , turns his back and walks away . ELIPHALET SKIPWITH By inference , an untidy feeder , one who tucks his napkin , and , God save us , shovels. p. 101 JAMES TOWNSHEND In short , a most singular animal . DONNA LISA still seated , speaking to her maids in a low voice , yet loud enough that all may hear . There is about the court , you may have noted , Carmencita , a species of tinseled worm , more familiar with under-plackets than with the weapons of the duello , a nest of impotent , varnished wasps , who sting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boast no schooling save in the college of heraldry , set the fashions in public about the central table of a favorite tavern , self-instructed in the latest stages of super-finical perversion . MORGAN , whose back is to DONNA LISA , pauses to listen , but does not turn . A rotten , dying population of compost , reeking in the nostrils of a whole city , specialists only in quips and disgraceful diseases . HENRY MARMION My lady has found her tongue ! ELIPHALET SKIPWITH This room is reserved , I believe . We should call a sergeant-at-arms to clear it of fishwives . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Donna Lisa ! DONNA LISA Lady Elizabeth Neville , sir . ELIPHALET SKIPWITH Oho , a camp-follower of the privateer ! So I suspected . HENRY MARMION A word with you two . MARMION , TOWNSHEND , and SKIPWITH go toward the left . The herald will call us . We tender our excuses , sir and madame , wishing you no worse luck than each other . The three go out. p. 102 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Lady Neville , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LISA I did not come willingly , Captain Morgan . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Yet when you came you were kind , and for that I thank you . I leave England tonight . DONNA LISA Yes ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN I had hoped to see you again . DONNA LISA It will be unnecessary . They bow . A bugle sounds from within , and a HERALD comes through , droning almost unintelligibly . They hear only the end of his proclamation . HERALD The king summons Captain Morgan , Henry Marmion of Essex , James Townshend of Essex . The HERALD pauses and looks in a puzzled way at MORGAN , who is still kneeling ; then asks aside , in a speaking voice : Captain Morgan , sir ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Righto . HERALD The king 's commands , sir ! He continues in his singsong . Eliphalet Skipwith , Esq. , of Kent , Captain Henry Morgan , Henry Marmion . His voice is lost as he goes out . MORGAN goes out. p. 103 DONNA LISA in sudden terror . George , George ! Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing about that , ma'am . DONNA LISA Oh , my God ! He 's gone in to the king without his squire . Did n't you see the others following ? GEORGE CASTLE Yes , ma'am , I saw them , but how was I to know ? DONNA LISA You might have guessed , you zany . GEORGE CASTLE I know it , ma'am . I might have , but I did n't . You see , I thought maybe the others was all wrong . I could go now , ma'am . DONNA LISA No , no , it 's too late now . Oh , why am I such a fool ? GEORGE CASTLE I do n't know , ma'am . DONNA LISA too broken to rejoin . Call the carriage , George . I ca n't bear to be here when they come out . GEORGE CASTLE Carriage for Lady Neville , ma'am ? DONNA LISA Yes , yes  --  Lady Elizabeth Neville . CARMENCITA who has been watching through the door at the left . Donna Lisa ! DONNA LISA on her way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 104 CARMENCITA You must see . He 's doing beautifully ! He carried it off with such an air . DONNA LISA Carmencita ! CARMENCITA Oh , oh , the terrible Townshend has tripped over his sword ! Oh , heavens , what a mess ! Quick , quick , come here ! MARIA and GEORGE , then DONNA LISA , go to the door at left . MARIA Why , he must be injured . The pages are pickin him up ! DONNA LISA Has the captain fallen down ? I might have known he 'd fall down or something ! CARMENCITA Not Morgan ! It is n't Morgan , Donna Lisa , it 's that great beast Townshend . He fell into his own scarlet cloak , and they have n't got him out yet . Saints deliver us ! Did he break a leg ? MARIA No , he 's going on again . CARMENCITA He had to go first , and he fell over his own shins . Oh , Lord ! Oh , Lord ! I shall die of joy . GEORGE CASTLE You see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king . MARIA How do you know ? GEORGE CASTLE Oh , I know him . I met him . DONNA LISA George , did you call that carriage ? p. 105 GEORGE CASTLE No , ma'am . DONNA LISA And why not , sir ? GEORGE CASTLE I sort of got interested , you see . DONNA LISA Call it now . GEORGE takes one more look at the proceedings on the left ; then , with no good grace , goes out . MARIA They 're all coming this way . CARMENCITA No , not all . Not the king 's retinue . MARIA Sir Terrible Townshend is limping . CARMENCITA Something must have happened to him . Surely a courtier does n't fall flat on a carpet without provocation . DONNA LISA Come , girls ; we shall be trapped here again . CARMENCITA It does n't matter , Donna Lisa . Everybody will be here . The room begins to fill with soldiers , courtiers , ladies . MORGAN enters . TOWNSHEND emerges , followed by his squire ; then by MARMION and SKIPWITH with their squires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have the honor to challenge you for that insult . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN On what ground , chevalier ? p. 106 JAMES TOWNSHEND You are aware of the ground , sir . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Oh , better aware of it than yourself , chevalier , since you have so much trouble keeping your feet ; but still far from certain of your cause . JAMES TOWNSHEND Do you deny that you tripped me from behind as we entered the king 's presence ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Surely , chevalier , you must be mistaken . I trip a knight like a charity scholar  --  I trip up a portly gentleman by the heels as he walks in line ? George ! Where 's George ? GEORGE enters at a word . George , where have you been ? Come , give me a reputation  --  do I trip ? GEORGE CASTLE Trip , Captain ? CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Yes , trip . GEORGE CASTLE Why , I should say not much , Captain , if any . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN There , you see , chevalier ! George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripped , George would know it . And what is the worst George can say of me ? He says not much , if any . HENRY MARMION This is no laughing matter , Captain Morgan  --  CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Sir Henry Morgan , my Lord Marmion ; Sir Henry Morgan , Deputy Governor of Jamaica . p. 107 HENRY MARMION As you please , Sir Henry , with all the further additions your imagination conjures . Still is this no laughing matter . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN It has caused considerable merriment , to my certain knowledge . HENRY MARMION My cousin has turned his ankle , sir , as a result of your rudeness , and is therefore in no condition to meet you . I offer myself in his place . JAMES TOWNSHEND Quite unnecessary , cousin . HENRY MARMION I insist . There lies my gauge . He tosses a glove at MORGAN 'S feet . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN There 's a kind of spunk in you , Marmion , boy , and I take it up on two conditions . HENRY MARMION And when has a knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It happens that I am leaving England within six hours , chevalier . We catch the tide at midnight . Before that hour I am at your service , providing  --  and this is the second condition  --  that if you are disarmed and unhurt you come with me as a volunteer . I do you the honor , you will perceive , of coveting you for my officer . HENRY MARMION There lies my challenge , Sir Henry . As for your conditions , I have not heard them . p. 108 CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Then I wo n't fight you , sir . I will not fight you because I am in a hurry , because I have nothing to gain by it , and because you have no chance against me . Do you think I would hold my ships at the whim of a younger son who has at last saved enough out of his allowance to buy him a garter ? HENRY MARMION Then formally , sir , and in the presence of this assembly , I dub you a coward , and you can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dubbing and your assembly ! Henry Morgan a coward ! Walk up to a few fortresses as I have done , take a few towns and a few Spanish treasure fleets ; then come back and call me a coward , and I promise to listen to you . You prattle , child . You should see some service . HENRY MARMION This will please the king . CAPTAIN HENRY MORGAN Ay  --  tell the king and the court and London town and the kingdom ! Tell them you challenged Morgan , and he ran away . I 'm through with the king and the court and London town and this side of the world . I 'm through with your flowers and ribbons and fancy talk and fancy morals . It means nothing to me what you think of me in this woman 's town , this lackey 's paradise . Judge me by your standards and be damned to them  --  I 've better standards of my own . Must I fight every boy who owns a sword and does n't like my conversation ? I 'll fight when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's won his spurs . Am I a game cock , to put on exhibition ? I 'll tell you what I think of this town and of you all . You 're a scrambling of all the petty thieves and faint hearts that do n't dare go out and loot for yourselves , a heap of leaners and hangers-on , afraid to go your own way , dragging on each other for support and licking the king 's boots for him , so he 'll let you live . And look at your courtiers  --  how long would they last on the deck of a man-o ' - war ? The deck of a man-o ' - war 's the place for a man . There 's beauty and courage and fighting blood on the deck of a ship of the line . You , Sir Marmion , you 're the one gallant here with the makings of a man in you . You ought to go out and take a look at my ships . I 'll duel you on that issue . A pause . MARMION disdains to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen and ladies , and God forgive you for a parcel of nincompoops . Unless , by chance , I 'm mistaken , and there 's a man among you  --  just one . On that chance , gentlemen , a call for volunteers , a last call for volunteers ! Who 'll follow Sir Henry Morgan to the Caribbean and the Spanish Main ? Who 's sick of living at the rotten center of an empire ? Who 'll see Jamaica with me , and a thousand ports of call ? A pause . Not one ! I thought so . George , we go as we came . MORGAN and GEORGE start toward the door at the left . MORGAN tosses his glove to the center of the stage . There lies my challenge ! MORGAN and GEORGE pause at left . There is a silence , then a slight stir and whispering . DONNA LISA rises slowly , walks deliberately to the glove , pulls it on , and goes up to MORGAN.                @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
