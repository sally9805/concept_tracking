The Idealism of Julien Benda M JULIEN BENDA is a critic who does not write ? often or too much . His " Belphegor , " which some of us recognized as an almost final statement of the attitude of contemporary society to art and the artist , was published in 1918 or 1919 . " La Trahison des Clercs " is the first book of the same type that M. Benda has written since " Belphegor " ; it represents some years of meditation and study ; we expected a book of the same importance . We are not disappointed . And just as " Belphegor , " although based upon an examination of French society alone , applied to the relation of society to the arts in all Europe and America , so is " La Trahison des Clercs " of general application . It is , indeed , more general ; for M. Benda now draws his illustrations from England , Germany , Italy and America , as well as from France . In these illustrations I do not think that he has been altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kipling , we are entitled to cross-examine him on his examination . M. Benda 's thesis may be divided into two parts , upon which we may find that we give separate verdicts . The first part is a general criticism of the political passions of the present time . The second part is a scrutiny of theculpability of certain noted men of letters , and implies a rule of life which M. Benda would lay down for men of letters of our time . In the first general diagnosis , I am inclined to yield complete assent ; in the second part , he does not seem to me to have carried his analysis of individuals far enough ; and the ideal that he holds up to contemporary men of letters seems to me to be infected with romance . But he puts a problem which confronts every man of letters ; the same problem which Mr. Wyndham Lewis has solved for himself in his own way by writing his recent books : the problem of the scope and direction which the activities of the artist and the man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Benda 's thesis I can not deal in this short paper . No one can disagree with his statement of the " modern consummation of political passions " ; his classification of passions of race ( e. g. , the Nordic theory and the Latin theory ) , passions of nations ( e. g. , fascism ) and passions of class ( e. g. , communism ) . I say that no one can disagree with the statement , which is made with all M. Benda 's usual lucidity and concision ; but the analysis could be carried much farther than M. Benda carries it . A new Remy de Gourmont could " dissociate " these ideas of Nationalism , of Class , of Race into their local components ; and there is also the Religious Idea ( not discussed by M. Benda ) to be dissociated ( with special reference to an actual controversy in England ) into components such as conviction , piety , prejudice and politics . Each of these subjects would take a chapter by itself . Let us merely accept M. Benda 's general statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern world ? in universality , in coherence , in homogeneity , in precision , in continuity and in condensation ; and proceed to the question : what is the role of the man of letters ; does he today involve himself in these passions , and if so , why ; and what is his proper function ? M. Benda brings a grave accusation against the modem " man of letters , " whom he calls the " clerc . " The accusation is retrospective , for it applies to most of the nineteenth century . The " ' cleat , " instead of sticking to his business of pure thought or pure art , has descended into politics in the widest and sometimes the lowest sense . M. Benda 's instances are mostly contemporary and mostly French . For the sake of completeness , no doubt , he has added a few foreigners , such as D'Annunzio , Kipling and William James . Among these three " clercs " I can see nothing in common . D'Annunzio is a brilliant prose artist of pseudo-decadence , who took up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me ) writes of the Empire because he was born in India instead of Sussex ( and as Mr. Dobree has said , part of his interesting peculiarity is that he makes the deck of a P. and 0 . liner seem as much British soil as Sussex or Shropshire ) ; James is included merely because he voiced a rather silly enthusiasm for the American war with Spain . M. Benda is more exact with his own compatriots . Two of those whom he accuses are Barres and Peguy . But one asks the question : has he carried his analysis far enough ? I dislike both of these writers as much as M. Benda does . But the question is : are these writers dangerous because they have concerned themselves with practical and political matters , or rather because their attitude , both in art , speculative thought and practical thought , was wrong ? Let us undertake to consider what are the causes of the inclination of men of letters ? including poets , novelists and even painters ( there is as yet no instance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : and second , to distinguish the artists or men of letters who excel in their proper sphere , but fail in their public occupation , from those who exhibit the same faults in their art as in their public activity , and finally from those who ( if there are such ) excel and are right in both . Ours is an unsettled age . No one is sure to what " class " of society he belongs ; at no time has " class " been more uncertain , and yet at no time has the consciousness of " class " been greater . Everyone is now conscious of class , but no one is sure what class is ; everyone is conscious of nationality and race ( our very passports impress that upon us ) , but no one is sure who or which or what is what or which race , or whether race is divided north and south or east and west or horizontally , or whether any of us is anything but a mongrel , and we suspect that the more we know about race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely mongrels . We are conscious of these questions as a man with indigestion is conscious of his stomach . It might almost be said that everybody is conscious of every question and no one knows any answers . This has been called an age of specialization , but it is very much the age of the amateur . Not long ago I attended , with some curiosity , a " religious convention " ; I heard a popular novelist and a popular actor talk nonsense for half an hour each , and then I left . There is , in fact , very little respect for authority : by which I meanrespect for the man who has special knowledge of some subject of which oneself is ignorant . The causes are , of course , many ; and I merely mention these things in order to point out that the meddling of men of letters in practical affairs , to which M. Benda objects , is only one phenomenon of a general confusion . The publicist who writes about everything on earth responds to the demand of a public which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this is perfectly commonplace , and I only mention it in order to point out that it is , in practice , extremely difficult to draw a line between the mere vulgarizer of knowledge and the " intellectual " of wide interests . It Is furthermore fallacious to group all the intellectuals who may be accused of doing somebody else 's business , or of pandering to popular political passions , into one category , as an examination of M. Benda 's instances will show . Today , it is enough to mention the Mornmsens , the Treitschkes , the Ostwalds , the Brunetieres , the Barres , the Lemaitres , the Peguys , the Maurras , the D'Annunzios and the Kiplings , to agree that the intellectuals clercs exercise political passions with all the characteristics of passion : tendency towards action , craving for immediate results , indifference to everything but the end in view , contempt for argument , violence , hatreds and obsessions idee fixe . This classification seems to me rather summary . To take the historians first : it is quite true that certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , have exhibited a bias in favor of national passions . It is also true of several other historians , not all contemporary with ourselves . Sometimes , when an historian has exactly the same bias as ourselves , we have the optical illusion of no bias at all ; to many people Gibbon or Mr. Lytton-Strachey seems to possess the virtue of detachment , instead of the virtue of a pleasant bias . The judgment of any historian roust depend both on the degree of his prejudice , and ( I am afraid ) upon our moral judgment of the prejudice itself . And the historians , I submit , are in a class by themselves . Far different is the case of writers like Peguy and Barres . If anyone has done more harm than Barres , it is Peguy . What these two authors have in common is a gift for language , and a sensibility for the emotional values of words , completely unrestrained by either logic or common sense . Like Hugo and Swinburne , they had no gift whatever for thinking ; but unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which looks to many people like a form of thought . But the question about such writers as these is not whether they have abused their gifts by applying them to the wrong uses , but whether they had any right to exist at all . The faults of the political outbursts of Peguy and Barres are the faults apparent in all of their work ; and if they are pernicious in politics , they are still more pernicious in literature . These two writers , again , are in quite a different category from Kipling . To make this difference quite clear would require a separate essay on Kipling , so I can only say this much : there is , no doubt , a bit of political jingoism in Kip-ling , but it does not affect his best work . The imperialism which is in all of Kipling 's work , and in the best of it , is not a political passion at all ; it has no practical aim , but is merely the statement of a fact : and there is all the difference in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the incitement to passion for an Empire in the future . On this point , M. Benda is perhaps no more unintelligent than any other Continental writer . Another author of our time , whom M. Benda does not mention , is equally to the point , and can not be classified with any of the preceding . It is Mr. Wells . Wells is nearer to Barres and Peguy than to Kipling , but must be distinguished from them very sharply . For whereas , to my thinking , there is a hopeless confusion in Barres and Peguy which was bound to vitiate everything they wrote , Wells has positive , self-contained gifts for one or two types of imaginative fiction which are peculiarly his own . His imagination is that of the Common Man raised to the highest power . But being that of the Common Man , and of the Common Man of our time , it does not know where to stop . Hence there is a sharp division . Mr. - Wells has all of the Common Man 's respect for facts and information , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts for imaginative purposes he is superb ; when he uses his imagination to expound facts , he is deplorable . He has the Common Man 's habit of assuming that if you have enough facts , you can dispense with reasoning , for the reason is supposed to be in the facts , instead of in the human mind ; he is the reverse of Mr. Belloc , who supposes that if you have reason behind you , you can do what you like with the facts . The expected happens ; when Belloc deals with facts , he fits them into his reason ; when Wells deals with facts , he hampers his magnificent imagination , and becomes the quite unconscious victim of his parish prejudices . ' What a pity that Belloc supposes himself to be an historian , and that Wells supposes himself to be a biologist ! Another case which M. Benda does not mention , very different from that of Wells , is that of Shaw . Shaw has this in common with Peguy , that some of his faults must be referred to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad master as to be a bad master . Peguy owes much to the philosophy of Bergson , which he translated into his own muddy rhetoric ; the philosophy of Bergson after all is at least a philosophy ; but what can be said for a disciple of the amateur crankiness of Samuel Butler ? I can not go thoroughly into the rase of Shaw , but would only point out that here is the case of a kind of trahison not discussed by M. Benda : Shaw , the master of a lucid and witty dialogue prose hardly equalled since Congreve , and of a certain power of observation , squandering these gifts in the service of worn-out , home-made theories , as in the lamentable " Methusaleh . " Here then , in England alone , we have at least three instances of clercs who might incur M. Benda 's displeasure : Kipling , Wells and Shaw , and no two of them in the same category , or doing the same thing for the same reasons . I do not say that there are not the same social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but merely that you can not pass the same judgment on any two of them as individuals . In France there is perhaps more uniformity , but great differences appear there too . The great weakness of Benda 's argument is that you can not pass directly from the criticism of an age to the criticism of the individuals who represent that age . It breaks down further when you recognize that for practical purposes there is not much difference between a clerc who excites popular passions himself , and a clerc who does so by his influence upon others . Bergson , one would say , fulfilled Benda 's requirements for the pure philosopher ; for , apart from one pardonable outburst in 1914 , when , as I remember , he identified France with Life , and Germany with Machinery , he has written nothing but pure philosophy . Yet half of the most excitable authors of our time , in France at least , have been Bergsonians . Peguy himself is a conspicuous example ; and Peguy is also the remarkable example of a writer who managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mind that there was room for everything in it somehow . He was a nationalist , a Dreyfusist , a republican who went into rhapsodies over Napoleon 's tomb , a Socialist and a Catholic of a rather doubtful sort . The influence of Bergson again , as well as that of Peguy and the ecstatic Leon Bloy , is strong upon the leader of the Catholic rationalists , M. Jacques Maritain . I have a warm personal admiration for M. Maritain , as much for his saintly character as for his intelligence ; but I have never seen a more romantic classicist , or a Thomist whose methods of thought were less like those of Aquinas . His occasional intemperance of language , and his occasional sentiment , hardly qualify him for the philosophical crown which M. Benda is waiting to bestow upon someone . And on the other hand , It is doubtful whether M. Benda himself deserves it . He holds up to the artist , to the critic , to the philosopher , an ideal of detachment from passions of class , race , nation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguish passion from interest , looks very admirable . But it implies a complete severance of the speculative from the practical which is itself impossible , and leads , in M. Benda 's implications , to an isolation which may be itself a romantic excess . I must avoid entering upon any question which would require a definition of those terrible terms romanticism and classicism ; but that is unnecessary , for we are concerned only with what is called romanticism . It is apparent , I mean , that when anyone nowadays attacks anything on the ground that it is romanticism , he is always himself in danger of falling into an opposite extreme which is also and equally romantic . M. Benda attackq Maurras and the " neo-classicists , " for instance , on the ground that their neo-classicism is itself a phase of romanticism . I think he is right , though the charge does not seem to me to be nearly se deadly as he seems to suppose . - What he does not see is that his own brand of classicism is just as romantic as anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , is that you can not lay down any hard and fast rule of what interests the clerc , the intellectual , should or should not have . All you can have is a standard of intellect , reason and critical ability which is applicable to the whole of a writer 's work . If there is a right relation of emotion to thought in practical affairs , so there is in speculation and art too . A good poem , for instance , is not an outburst of pure feeling , but is the result of a more than common power of controlling and manipulating feelings : the faults which made D'Annunzio , for instance , rather a deplorable politician made him a second-rate artist . The surest way , perhaps , of judging the work of an author who ventures into a new field , whether it be that of political controversy or some other , is to trace if we can the growth of his interests and their relations among each other . A man may be led , by the connections of things themselves , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary critic , was led to study the whole of social life . Where there is no vital connection , the man may be a brilliant virtuoso , but is probably nothing more . Even within one sphere of business , as in a novel or a play , the vital connection may be absent ; and if it is absent , the novel or poem or play will not endure .
