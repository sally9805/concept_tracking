txt // STOCK LIMITS AND TIME LIMITS One of the highly important phases of adjustment pertains to gaging the stock limit or average inventory according to expected seasonal requirements . No matter what a suitable average inventory for a seasonal item may be , the ideal calls for the stock being closed out at the end of the season , just as completely as possible without incurring loss of either sales or prestige that would more than offset the cost and loss incident to carrying the left-overs into the next season for that item . In this connection , the important consideration is that the possible loss which might result from taking a chance on passing up a few sales may impress us more readily than the loss which does result from carrying over the left-overs . Everyone seems to realize fully enough that left-overs are to be avoided . Some genius even concocted a catchy sentence that sounds like a good title for an up-to-date song , " We want turnovers , not left-overs . " But when we undertake to determine specifically the extent to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job on our hands ! No wonder the profit-making managers figure in terms of open-to-buys and end-of-month stocks , as well as desired stock turns , initial mark-ups , allowable markdowns , and expected margins . No wonder time limits are becoming more and more generally recognized as the necessary companion of stock limits . No wonder we are appreciating the importance of giving more studious consideration to the influence of carrying costs . No wonder we are thinking more and more about when an item will sell , together with our consideration of the price it will bring . STOCK LIMITS AND SEASONAL VARIATION : another important consideration is so closely related to tines limits that it just : about mike care of itself when // the time phase of stock limits is adjusted to the best advantage . This might be called the relationship between the basic stock limit or average inventory and the specific or divisional stock limits . Average inventory necessarily is considered over an extended time period , usually six months or a year ; and we ordinarily apply the term to indicate previous accomplishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this element , while planning our profit-producing program , as the " basic stock limit . " It might also be called the " eXpected average inventory . " Now , if our profit-producing program is to work out to the best advantage , it becomes necessary to subdivide both the sales quotas and stock limits sufficiently to indicate clearly any seasonal variation that may require ttent ion in keeping the road to maximum sales with n i n i n i um stocks . Monthly divisions usually serve the pw r t lose very well . When we have a clear vision of the operation of the complete profit-producing program , as it is expected to action month by month , we can see fairly well where e stock limits must be set , by months ; to guard against vial ; unnecessary merchandise between seasons ; and to 1w sure of having necessary merchandise in season . But even the in season may vary extensively , depending m the policy of the store and the class of customers serves chiefly . A striking illustration of this point is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring Hats " the week before Christmas . CONSISTENT ASSORTMENTS THE PIVOTAL POINT After the sales quotas and stock limits have been adjusted properly to accord with the expected seasonal variations , mine to the pivitol point of it all which rests in that t and perpetual problem merchandising : The consistant assortment sunset hues called the " model stock . " // It is the answer to this all-important question : In what kinds ( styles , designs , qualities ) , sizes , quantities and price ranges of merchandise is the amount established by our stock limit to be invested ? Clearly , the answer to that question is also the answer to the very heart of the great question of right buying which involves both exclusion and inclusion . In fact , for the sake of a clear-cut though general vision , we might well say that the consistent stock assortment includes every item for which a profitable demand exists or can , with reasonable effort , be made to exist ; and excludes everything else . It carries in stock what is wanted ; and keeps out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to define right buying specifically , the more we seem to be forced back to the basic proposition that right buying consists in buying : 1 . The right item , of the right kind , and right quality . 2 . In the right quantity at the right time , and right price . No one can get away from the fundamental fact that the difference between the ordinary buyer and the real buyer is measured by the degree in which they manage to conform to the dictates of the above trite sayings . One of the points that seem particularly worthy of constant recognition is contained in the oft-expressed thought that a good way to sell to the customer is to buy for the customer . When we know what customers want or can , with reasonable effort , be made to want , we have a master key to the practical solution of the ever recurring problem of maintaining consistent assortments . CONSISTENT ASSORTMENTS ARE MEASURED IN UNITS Let us note , now , an essential difference between stock limits and stock assortments : The former is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of units . No matter how for the subdivision of the basic stock limit may be carried , the dollar measure is the only one // applied . The limit always pertains to the amount to be invested . Assortments , however , only concern themselves with specific items ; with units of merchandise . It is simply a question of what items are to be carried in stock , how many or how much of each , and how long . The selection of the items and their quantity must be based , of course , upon effective consumer demand ; that is , upon the ability and willingness of people to buy at profitable prices , and in reasonable and carefully established periods of time . Now , in making selections , we obviously have two general classes of goods to consider : 1 . Goods which we have not handled before . 2 . Goods which we have handled before . And it is equally obvious that , for the first of these lasses , the necessary selection is far more experimental than for the second . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of specific experience which may be made to serve It++ : - helpful guide in buying . The more definitely we know What has happened in the past , the better can we judge the Ut ore . Happily , all purchases , excepting only the first for any tt- , are in the second class and can have the benefit of dance through recorded experience whenever it is needed will prove helpful . After all , the selection of the units that make up the twist cut assortment for any line of merchandise , together with when , and in what quantity , and at what price to y then- , stands clearly as the core of right buying . . Truly , selection is king ! In buying merchandise , just every other human endeavor , the faculty of selection - choice is the most important one we are called upon exercise . The - Wore guidance we can get to help us in our merchandise select ions , therefore , the better our chances for success in developing ; and maintaining consistent assort54 METHODS OF RETAIL MANAGEMENT ments ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks is to be reached . STOCK ASSORTMENTS THE " MEANS " OF CONTROL Bearing always in mind that stock limits serve merely as the basis for positive stock control , we readily see why stock assortments stand as the " means " through which the control is made possible . The stock limit can be right only when it provides for an investment on which a consistent assortment can be maintained ; and the assortment can be consistent only when it is held within the bounds established by the limits . The two must harmonize . In this connection , it is well to remember that stockturn figures usually are based on volume of sales , which is all very well . But the stock turns thus figured are , like the stock limits which also are based on value , somewhat in the rough . The final test of the effectiveness of stock turns rests with the turn of each unit of stock . When the units are ample as to variety and are turning satisfactorily , the entire stock problem is well in hand . No matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store as a whole never can be at their best unless the turn of each individual item is at its best . So the control of stock , though it may be planned and checked in terms of dollar value , finally depends upon what the individual items , the units , of stock are doing . That is why the consistent assortment becomes the means or instrument through which more positive control of stock is made possible , and through which sales and profit are increased . THE BUYING RECORD AS A BUYING GUIDE Obviously , dependable information as to what each unit of stock has done in the past , serves as a good though by no means infallible indicator of what it may be expected to do in the future . // In their efforts to maintain consistent assortments , many merchants and buyers feel that their close personal contact with the stock keeps them sufficiently informed to judge each purchase properly ; to keep sales up to the maximum and stocks down to the minimum . Some depend on referring to invoices when in doubt as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others apply stock records of one kind or another , : liming always to meet the specific needs of the individual store most effectively . In a general way , then , buyers may be grouped into two distinct classes : 1 . Those who are memory guided . 2 . Those who are record guided . Some , of course , have greater need for recorded information than others . Some require more completely detailed buying records than others . The larger the store the greater the need for detailed revords , because direct personal control is less possible . II is always a question of the practical use to be made of Elie information the records reveal . Relatively speaking , however , the smaller or average HI ores are now in greatest need of the development of effective use of informative records . Among this great group , the necessity for such information has been less apparent in the past ; yet the possibility for its profitable ? 1 application is almost without visible limit . Getting back to stock or buying records specifically , the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock control and more consistent stock assortments ? The answer is : They do , when they are started right and handled properly . As between memory-guided and record-guided buying , lutist five important points always are in favor of the ' ter , because recorded information presents the following distinct advantatges : I. Has greater scope . 2 . Is more reliable . // 3 . Relieves the mind of unnecessary burden . 4 . Enables others to use the information when occasion requires . 5 . Provides a basis for comparison which aids judgment . To whatever extent stock records and buying records may be used , the underlying purpose is to serve as a buying guide ; to assist in maintaining consistent assortments of merchandise , always aiming at the basic ideal of maximum sales with minimum stocks . PRICE RANGE A FACTOR IN ASSORTMENTS The range of selling prices for a given class of merchandise is , in some instances , a particularly important factor in determining the consistent assortment . Consider silk hosiery , for example . Sales records seem to indicate that customers buy hosiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay , thus emphasizing , the importance of the price range as a factor in the makeup of the assortment . For this and all similar classes of merchandise , sales need to be analyzed and studied to learn which prices have the strongest appeal to the store 's customer group . Sales of such merchandise might be analyzed on a basis somewhat as follows , but varied to meet the specific needs of the individual store or line : 1 . Lowest price carried . 2 . Lowest price for which a full line is carried . 3 . Price between 2 and 4. 4 . Best selling line . 5 . Price between 4 and 6. 6 . Highest price for which a full line is carried . 7 . Highest price carried . Another effective method is to list every price offered in a given line , and record every sal , e made at each price . The information thus revealed ? that is , the quantity sold at each price - soon guides to the consistent price assortment for that line . // An analysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prices , and in increasing both the sales volume and the ratio of profit on sales . Suitable forms for such studies are illustrated on pages 59 and 60 . We readily can see that studies of this kind often serve their purpose when made occasionally , continued over a time period no longer than is required to develop the desired information , and repeated whenever the situation seems to justify . USEABLE INFORMATION ? THE GUIDE TO ASSORTMENTS Clearly , the maintaining of consistent assortments , like the setting of right sales quotas and suitable stock limits , depends primarily upon useable information plus ( always ) the " character and extent of the imagination or vision with which it is combined . - According to the terse statement of a highly successful merchant , just three things are necessary in maintaining consistent assortments of merchandise , that is , in right buying . He gives these as : I . Information as to past performance . Information as to market conditions . 3 . Vision as to possibilities . The question of just what information can bit put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely a matter of individual judgment based upon the needs of the specific Its ( .. From the storekeeper who depends entirely upon what e sees I ii fore him and can recall without the use of records , e find innumerable degrees of variation until we reach tr to ; merchant who carries his recorded information to the ' best possible point . In some instances , the record on each item of merchant v ill give such detailed information as is indicated fin following list : I.Complete description of the item . Where obtainable Where bought . Cost and retail prices . // 4 . Quantity bought , and when . 5 . Quantity received , and when . 6 . Quantity sold , and when . 7 . To whom sold ( large sales only ) . 8 . Returns and exchanges . 9 . Degree of fluctuation in prices . 10 . Degree of fluctuation in consumption . 11 . Service and dependability of purchasee. 12 . Margin produced . 13 . Cost of doing business . 14 . Resulting profit . Of course no one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store should undertake to develop through records , because he can not tell to what extent the information can and will be used advantageously . The fundamental question about record information always is : Can we use it to advantage ? But the more we consider the importance of information ' as a guide to consistent assortments of merchandise , together with the profit-producing possibilities in such assortments , the more clearly we see that the question of informative records deserves thoughtful and continued attention from every merchandiser . We can not review too often the great fundamental fact that every phase of merchandising rests finally upon the exercise of judgment , and that judgment is good in proportion as it combines the elements of information and imagination . The maintenance of consistent assortments of merchandise is , then , a matter of judgment ; and the pivotal position of this phase of merchandising indicates why useable information and controlled imagination play the leading roles . CHAPTER V HOW A SIMPLE BUYING RECORD GUIDES TO CONSISTENT ASSORTMENTS A record guide to consistent stock assortments can be obtained with remarkable ease by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording sales in detail . Only three points are considered in the formula . The proper grouping of items simplifies the process . Definite information as to the total quantity disposed of since placing the last order proves decidedly helpful , especially when the same information over a number of time periods is at hand for comparison . A simple form guides toward the goal of consistent stock assortments , the essential basis for maximum sales with minimum stocks . Some merchants believe that a record guide to consistent stock assortments is hopelessly involved with burdensome detail . However , a careful study of the basic principles and t h e i r proper application to the needs of the individual store , usually convinces one that remarkably good results win he obtained with almost surprising ease . The first essential in such a study is to determine what element or elements of information the record should reveal . We see at once that the basic information required for guidance to consistent stock assortments is the quantity of each item that has been sold in previous periods of time . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider the other elements through which the required deductions are made . In some instances it is possible to keep a detailed record f all receipts and disposals of every item of stock handled , in the case of large units . For the majority of retail 61 // stocks , however , it is neither practicable nor necessary to record the individual sales . We turn our attention immediately , therefore , to a short-cut plan which develops the required information without the necessity of recording sales in detail , but with sufficient dependability for practical use as a buying guide . A SIMPLE PRINCIPLE IS APPLIED The principle of this plan has long been used by merchants to determine the cost of the goods sold in the period for which profit or loss was being figured . The method of application is simple and correspondingly easy . Only the following three steps are required in the operation : 1 . Begin with : inventory ( at cost ) at the beginning of the period . 2 . Add : the cost value of all goods received into stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all goods handled during the period . 3 . Subtract : inventory ( at cost ) at the close of the period . Result : cost value of all the goods disposed of during the period . In this time-honored inventory procedure we deal , of course , with values , the dollar measure . When we apply the same method to ascertaining the quantity of any item sold , we follow exactly the same three steps of procedure but consider each item of stock on the basis of its own accomplishment . The formula for the process may be stated , then , as : 1 . Begin with : quantity in stock at the beginning of the period . 2 . Add : quantity received during the period . Equals : total quantity handled during the period . 3 . Subtract : quantity on hand at the close of the period . Result : quantity disposed of during the period . / A simple principle , indeed , but one that has real possibilities for practical and profitable application . // THREE POINTS TO CONSIDER In placing a reorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points usually taken into consideration are : 1 . Quantity on hand at the time of considering the purchase . 2 . Quantity disposed of in the previous time period or periods . 3 . Probable sale during the time period for which the purchase is contemplated . Now , when a suitable record for applying the above simple formula is in use , we will have before us the information involved in both the first and second of these points whenever we may consider purchasing a given item . A count will show how many of that item are in stock at the time and the record will reveal , through a simple computation , the quantity consumed or sold in the previous period or periods , depending upon how long the record has been in use . As to the third point : The record will guide us in determining the probable sale to whatever extent past performance may be indicative of future performance . I ci other words , we will be in position to base our judgment on recorded . experience which , in most instances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obtained without the use of a record . THE REQUIRED RECORD IS EASILY MAINTAINED The above formula indicates clearly that there must be me practicable means for keeping tab on : 1 . The quantity of each item in stock at the beginning each period of time covered by a purchase . ' ' 2 . All of the receipts or incoming shipments of each m placed in stock within that period . With joist these two elements of information before us , We need do to Ise able to ascertain the quantity consumed Id or otherwise disposed of ) in a given time period , // is to find out how many of the item are in stock at the close of that period . The quantity in stock at the time of considering a purchase , is something that every careful buyer is sure to know definitely . If he does not know positively , he will count the stock at the time to make sure . In spite of the obvious simplicity of knowing all of the influencing facts , there often is a tendency to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is , and as being out of all proportion with practicability . Buying by guess is the prevailing practice among those who are thus impressed . But those who take time for a thorough investigation , those who dig deep enough to get a full grasp of both the how and the why of it all , usually see that the principal effort required is in getting the right kind of a start . Furthermore , careful consideration usually leads to the conclusion that if an article is worth handling , it is worth recording in some way or another , worth keeping track of either directly or indirectly . Then , when it is seen that a simple process of recording will develop information that really serves as a guide to right buying , making the necessary start begins to loom as a decidedly profitable investment . With that conclusion reached , we are ready to devote ourselves immediately to finding out how the small amount of necessary recording can be accomplished with the greatest ease . PROPER GROUPING OF ITEMS SIMPLIFIES THE PROCESS A variety of methods can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a method , the chief aim is , of course , to apply the underlying principle most advantageously . To make sure that we clearly recognize the underlying principle and its correct application , let us consider the / practical use of a simple form which covers a number of possible situations in which the quantity sold should be // ascertained without the necessity of recording individual sales . The general design of a suitable form is shown in our illustration ( Form 7 ) on page 71 . The form can be used either as a loose leaf or a card record . A separate sheet or card is used for each line of merchandise or suitable grouping of items . A separate line on the form is used for each specific item of stock . When a line of merchandise includes more items than t lie sheet or card will accommodate , the record is continued over as many sheets or cards as may be required . The stock can be divided into any desired number of merchandise divisions for suitable groupings on the record form . The plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of requirements . A separate sheet or card might be used for each specific item of stock , but that would add greatly to the required number of sheets or cards and would cause the loss of a distinct advantage in comparison which accrues from careful grouping . THE PROCESS OF GROUPING IS ILLUSTRATED The process of merchandise grouping to facilitate the use of the form we are discussing , may be illustrated tinily with any article that is made and handled in different kinds and sizes . Men 's collars will serve as well any other item for a specific illustration . Let us assume that we are handling a brand of collars made in five distinct lines which we will designate as : t , Regular . 2 . Youths ' . 3 , Clerical . Soft . Semi-soft . Suppose , now , that the regular line is made in twenty Are nt styles , : and that each of these styles is made in twenty different sizes . That would make a total // of approximately four hundred items in regular collars alone . Even if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buying record we are considering would require only twenty record sheets because all sizes of one style would be recorded as a group on one sheet . As each style is designated by a name , the twenty sheets would be arranged alphabetically to facilitate quick reference . In the youths ' line , however , we might have only two styles , each carried in but a few sizes . In that case , the total number of items in these two styles might be cared for easily in two groups on one sheet of the record . A similar situation probably would be found in the clerical line . When we come to the soft and semi-soft collars , a different situation may confront us . Each style or model may be made in several grades or of different materials , thus increasing the number of items . Should each of these items be carried in a full list of sizes , a separate sheet would be used ' for each . The distinguishing feature would be noted in the space provided for description at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any kind of store and can be continued to any desired point , regardless of what the conditions may be . Such classification or grouping always is possible and usually is practicable , that is , helpful . While most classes of merchandise can be grouped easily for this type of buying record , it does not follow that this is the type to be applied to all classes of merchandise . Our present interest is centered on getting the clearest possible recognition of the principle involved . Where and when to apply it is a matter for subsequent consideration . The process of merchandise grouping for this convenient type of buying record and guide may be compared/with the making of a satisfactory index for a catalogue covering the same merchandise . The on ( ? important difference is // that the list for the buying record will be divided into such sections as will permit the easy handling of each section or group on one sheet or card . HOW THE FORM IS USED The form shown in our illustration ( Form 7 ) is designed for convenient use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ascertaining the quantity of any item sold in a given time , without the necessity of recording the sales in detail . The record is written up usually at the time an order for any line of goods is being placed . A set of three columns is provided for each purchase . A number of these sets of columns is placed on each page for the sake of a continued record that will facilitate making the comparisons which determine the practicability and value of the record . The date of the purchase is recorded at the top of the met of columns . The set is used for only one purchase , whether it be for one or more of the items listed on the page . The three columns in each set are headed respectively : In Stock , Ordered , and Received . Now , as previously mentioned , when the placing of an order for any line of merchandise is being considered , it obviously is necessary to know how many , if any , of each kin ( size or kind ) in that line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this information is obtained , of course , by the simple process of counting the stock ; and this is or should done whether or not a buying record is being used . Should it be found that no purchase is to be made at time , there will be no need for recording this information because another count will be made the next time placing of that order is considered . But when another is placed , the quantity in stock at that time becomes important information which needs to be recorded for re use . It is , also , one of the factors which determine quantity then to be ordered . Another factor is the rate of consumption , that is , how they have been sold or otherwise disposed of in a given // length of time . In this important factor , the record plays a particularly effective part . Unless specific information as to the rate of consumption is in some way available , the buyer necessarily reaches his conclusion on the basis of memory . The several advantages of record-guided over memory-guided buying were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed , the quantity of each item ordered will be recorded in the Ordered column on the line of the record devoted to that item . This portion of the record serves merely as a memorandum of the fact that an order was placed , together with when it was placed , and the quantity of each item ordered . THE RECORD OF GOODS RECEIVED The column headed Received is used for recording the quantities received and placed in stock , thus becoming a portion of the total quantity of that item handled . All of the items recorded in the Ordered column usually are received and placed in stock at one time . The date placed at the top of the Received column applies to all of the entries in that column not otherwise dated . A simple check mark might be placed in this column to indicate that the quantity recorded in the Ordered column on the same line has been received and placed in stock . Some advantage accrues , however , from repeating the quantity in the Received column . It gives the information more specifically and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when next ordering . When a partial shipment is received , both the date and the quantity should be recorded on the line devoted to the item , leaving space for recording the additional shipment or shipments . Partial shipments , though they may not occur frequently , are to be recorded separately for the completion of the record . Now , when all the goods on any order have been received and recorded , the buying record will reread the following information regarding each item on that order : // 1 . Quantity in stock at the time of ordering . 2 . Date of order . 3 . Quantity ordered . 4 . Date received . 5 . Quantity received . 6 . Number of shipments made on the order . HOW THE INFORMATION IS USED We are now ready to consider how the recorded information is applied in developing the guide to right buying . Whenever we ascertain how many of any item are in stock , we are equipped to compute the quantity of that item consumed ( sold or otherwise disposed of ) since placing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , that three of a given item were in stock at the time of placing the last order , that twenty'four were then ordered and have since been placed in stock , and that the present count shows six remaining in stock . We then apply the simple formula which already has been mentioned . The computation is so easy that it usually can be made mentally . The situation above outlined would work out as follows : figure This definite information as to the total quantity disposed of since placing the last order proves decidedly helpful , especially when the same information for a number time periods is at hand for comparison . ' If an cutler is placed , the quantity consumed will be ordeal in the consumed space on the line for that item , t in the preceding set of columns . The consumption yes should stand out prominently for the sake of conknee in future comparisons . They might be entered red , for example , or circled. // With the quantity consumed between each two purchasing dates thus clearly shown , a glance over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly how recorded experience serves as a practicable base for the exercise of good judgment in buying . AN ILLUSTRATION WITH FIGURES Carefully looking over a specific illustration with figures , will help to fix in mind the simple principle of the " buying record and guide . " Any line of merchandise would serve the purpose of this illustration . To make the case specific , we must select some one line . Let it be varnish brushes . Those who do not handle varnish brushes may find it helpful to work out a similar illustration with one of their own lines . The simplicity of the plan , its ease of operation , and practical value will thereby be made more impressive . We show a portion of the record covering three , orders and two buying periods , sufficient to bring out every essential point . The illustration follows . CHAPTER VI OTHER SIMPLE FORMS THAT GUIDE TO CONSISTENT ASSORTMENTS A careful study of several forms will help to establish the principle of the " buying record and guide " clearly in mind , and reveal the simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to selected lines . Each case must be decided on the basis of its own merit . The fact that prevention is better than cure , applies as well to the health of the store as to personal physical fitness . Comparison is the all-important element in the use of any buying record . The forms shown are merely to illustrate the principle . Suitable variation can be made to meet any specific requirement . All forecasting is based directly upon information revealed through recorded experience . The direct purpose of the " buying record and guide " is to develop dependable information regarding the rate of consumption on specific items of merchandise . The application of a simple buying record and guide was outlined and illustrated in the preceding chapter . The proper application of the principle involved may be brought out more clearly through a careful study of several additional forms which develop the same information in a somewhat different way . No matter what kind of a form is used for a buying record and guide , the object always is to develop the information that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right buying for any regularly handled line ; a guide to the development and maintenance of consistent stock assortments . As indicated in the preceding chapter , the essential information which can be recorded easily is twofold : 1 . The ( quantity of each item in snick at the time of placing : in order . 72 // 2 . The quantity of each item received into stock since placing the last previous order . The quantity ordered is recorded merely as a memorandum , and dates are recorded chiefly to measure the time between orders . ' This fundamental information applies to the forms considered in the present chapter , just as they do to the form presented in the preceding chapter . THE OLD FAMILIAR BUGABOO Before taking up the application of the forms , let us devote a bit more thinking to the old familiar bugaboo that an excessive amount of effort may be required . As we all know sc ' well , both work and pleasure often appear greater in anticipation than they prove to be in realization . It is somewhat like the upgrades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade , the steeper it seems . But when we actually begin the climb , we experience the delightful sensation of seeing the road apparently flatten under the weight of the car . Furthermore , the grades we are making for the first time usually impress us as being more formidable than those in our accustomed routes . In a similar way , the things we are not in the habit of doing tend to cause us to place an undue emphasis on the amount of effort required . But , that is as it should be . It serves as a guard against taking on useless tasks . It influences us toward making a more thorough study of a proposed plan . Only to those % ho do not make a careful analysis , will this tendency not as a hindrance to progress . The progressive buyer who is not in the habit of using a record guide , will weigh the possible advantages against the required effort . When he first contemplates the process , he probably will center his attention chiefly on what seems to be additional work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtainable results , he may see that It leads oil ultimately to less effort and more profitable accom74 METHODS OP ' RETAIL MANAGEMENT plishment . The proof of actual test will bear out his conclusion , providing only that the record is right and that it is handled properly . A buying record and guide , such as we are discussing , will demonstrate clearly that it can be kept up with remarkable ease . Once properly started , it requires but a few simple jottings of figure information which every careful buyer has at hand when placing an order for a regularly handled line . The fundamental difference between buying with or without the aid of a record guide lies , therefore , in simply recording the information already at hand to make it available for future use as a base from which consistent assortments can be maintained more easily . THE BUYING GUIDE MAY BE APPLIED TO SELECTED LINES A feature which is closely related to the element of required effort , is found in the possibility of applying the record guide to selected lines only . We thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of recorded experience . For example , specialities which are stocked because they happen to be available on an advantageous basis and are not to be handled regularly , obviously present no occasions for comparison as do goods that are handled continuously . In cases of that kind , the buying record would serve merely as a history of the transaction . It might be worth while from that standpoint , but not as a buying guide in the meaning we are giving to that expression . An extreme case is found in produce as handled by the grocer who goes to market daily or who buys from the irregular and more or less limited supply that is presented at his door . He realizes that the effective demand for these goods is influenced chiefly by their appearance and freshness . Practically , he buys this line on the basis of a specific specialty . He therefore would find no particular value in a record of previous purchases to hell ) indicate the rapidity of sales as a guide to right buying . // But even in cases of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple recording of purchases , especially when spoilages also are recorded . Such a record would indicate the trend of the sales , which might serve as an inspiration to special effort . Then , when he applies the simple method for ascertaining the actual profit in the line , as discussed in Chap . IX , he will be in position more accurately to determine the extent to which effort can be applied advantageously . So we get back to the fact that each case must be decided on the basis of its own merits ; back to the process of selection . The big point always to remember is : When the underlying principle is understood thoroughly , common sense will take care of the details . THE " OUNCE OF PREVENTION " Another phase of the situation deserves a moment 's attention . Some incline to the belief that a buying record and guide ( which is based on units ) is needed only when the dollar figures indicate that a given department is not performing satisfactorily . They think the recording of items is practicable only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to the criticism that it serves as a cure for a known disturbance , rather than as a preventive of possible trouble . More careful consideration probably would lead the user of the apply-only-when-it-hurts plan to realize that , " An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure , " applies as well to the economic health of the store as to our personal physical fitness . The mere fact that a trouble exists proves conclusively that a damage has been done . After all , the only way to prevent damage is to avoid its cause . And we need to remember always that some of our greatest commercial dangers lie in undiscovered errors and invisible losses . We need to apply the principle of the clinic , not the postmortem . // Besides , the hit-it-occasionally practice deprives the store almost completely of the important comparative feature of recorded experience , and its only purpose is to avoid effort . But this takes us back to the consideration of effort as already discussed . Really , when the habit of jotting down the information is once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clearly , then , when the buying record and guide is used for any item or line , it pays to use it continuously . HOW " FORM 12 " IS USED The form presented in the preceding chapter was suggested as one of a variety of forms suitable for use as a buying record and guide applying to regularly handled lines of merchandise for which it is not practicable to record individual sales . We saw then that , though the form may be varied almost without limit , the underlying principle remains always the same . The forms shown in this chapter apply exactly the same principle , but in a different way . In fact , the order of procedure is just reversed . In the preceding form , a set of columns was used for each purchase , and a line for each item . In the present forms , a line is used for each purchase and a column or set of columns for each item , that is , each size or kind of the article or line to which the page is devoted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of either of the present forms , we gain the advantage of having the continuous record for each item more condensed , and in a columnar arrangement which facilitates comparison . Comparison is , of course , the all-important element in the use of any buying record ; comparison of quantities consumed in the different time periods between purchasing dates . Therein lies the effective guide to right buying . To facilitate the process of making comparisons , Form 12 ( page 83 ) , just as the form shown in the preceding chapter , is provided with a. special column for recording the quantity consumed bctVicen each two purchasing dates . The time // elapsed between these two purchasing dates is determined easily by noting the entries in the date column . Should the user desire to have the time period stand out more clearly , it can be recorded in the same space with the quantity consumed . With this time period definitely in mind , a glance at the Consumed Previous Period quantity will show the rate of consumption which , together with the length of time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate the logical quantity to buy . It will be noticed that the In Stock and Received entries are to be made in the same column , one above the other . This is done to facilitate the adding of these two quantities ( In Stock and Received ) which will give the total quantity handled . Then , the present quantity in stock which is entered in the next space below , can be subtracted easily to ascertain the quantity consumed since the last previous order was placed . The form is designed , of course , merely to illustrate the general arrangement . Suitable variations can be made readily to meet any specific requirement . HOW " FORM 13 " IS USED Form 13 ( page 84 ) shows another general arrangement which permits placing a greater number of items on a line of ' the page . To accomplish this , we must use a separate line for each element of required information , as indicated by the form . 1 ' or the purpose of showing clearly how this particular form is used , and also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guide based on unit runt rot , let us follow through a concrete illustration . Assume we carry the X YZ line in four sizes designated respectively as Nos. 100 , 200 , 300 , and 400 , and that each size is carried in two colors , black and tan , designated as Nos. 1 and 2 . We have , then , eight specific items in the line . // The color number is added to the size number to make the stock number . Thus the 100 size in black is known as No. 101 , and in tan as No. 102 ; and so on for the other sizes . The first time we place an order for this line after the record is started , the quantity of each item then in stock will be recorded on the In Stock line in the column headed with the stock number of that item . If the order happens to be placed January 2 , this entry might appear as follows : Assume , next , that we order 12 each of Nos. 102 and 301 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded , of course , on the Ordered line in the proper item columns . Later , if the goods are received as ordered , say on Jan. 7 , the same quantities will be entered on the Received line . The above portion of the form will then appear as follows : Now , suppose we consider placing the next order for this line on Feb. 2 . If the quantities in stock justify ordering , we will record the count on the next In Stock line . This entry might appear as follows : With this information before us , the consumption will be determined by simply subtracting the present In Stock // quantities from the total of the In Stock and Received quantities immediately above . The differences will be entered on the preceding Consumed line for convenient comparison with the present In Stock quantities . The record on the page will then appear as follows : The record now shows us how many of each item were disposed of in January and how many remain in stock . Of No. 101 , 2 were sold and 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold . But more time may be required to determine whether that means inconsistent Assortment . No. 201 , however , already gives evidence of something wrong , as eight were consumed and none are in stock . Nos. 202 and 301 also indicate that an order should have been placed before . A mere glance at the figures suffices to tell us that both the 100 and 400 sizes need watching because of their tendency to hang on ; while the 200 and 300 sizes deserve attention because of their power to mom On . Clearly , we have in stock too many of the former and too few of the latter ; a condition of inconsistent assortment which the intelligent use of the record will tend to correct in t he course of a very few buying periods . As the record cold limes and more buying periods are covered , greater comparison will make the figures reveal more positive and more helpful information . // HOW THE INFORMATION IS USED IN JUDGING FUTURE NEEDS The rapidly developing art of forecasting business conditions is based directly upon information revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather predicting , and the art of judging future requirements in merchandise . In no case can the experience of the past be taken as an infallible and all-sufficient indicator of what is ahead , but in every instance it serves as a necessary foundation for the reaching of sound conclusions . At the weather bureau you will find recorded experiences accumulated with remarkable completeness and thoroughness . Yet those of us who are not properly trained in the effective use of this information , can do a better job of weather predicting by depending entirely upon our corns and rheumatic tendencies . Ask the weather man how he reaches his conclusions . He will tell you that a variety of twos and twos are put together , but that it depends finally upon the exercise of judgment . And in the weather bureau , as in the store and everywhere , judgment is neither more nor less than a combination of information and imagination . Some one has stated aptly that the man who makes practical use of statistics ( recorded experiences classified ) is an " educated guesser . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never is eliminated entirely . It can be eliminated with reference to what has transpired in the past , but not with reference to what may happen in the future . So we always get back to the basic proposition that information is valuable only to the . degree in which we use it as a guide to better judgment . With this thought in mind , let us look again at our barely started record of the X Y Z line , and imagine it as being extended over a number of buying periods . We readily see that , as the record is continued period after period , the story it tells becomes more and more informative . It will help us to judge not only how many , if any , of each item should be ordered , but also how often // we should order to obtain the greatest practicable rate of stock turns . Suppose , for example , our continued record for this line indicates that one week ordinarily is required to receive the goods after an order is placed , and that a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that this line should be ordered one week in advance of our needs and on the basis of four-week buying periods , unless unusual circumstances arise . If this happens to be a line that is subject to practically constant demand ( without seasonal or other varying influences ) , we will aim to develop a stock-turn rate of twelve times a year . Again , should we unfortunately be accumulating dead or dying stock , the record will tell us that in unmistakable language . Suppose the extended record reveals a continuation of the present situation ; that the 200 and 300 sizes have kept up their activity , and the 100 and 400 sizes their inactivity . The record then tells us that special effort is required to reduce our stock of the latter sizes and , perhaps , that they should be closed out and discontinued . In that way , we are guided to thaw out the frozen investments and place the redeemable dollars where they have a chance to do something for us , in stock that can be made to produce a profit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals with units of merchandise , the price element has received no mention in our discussion of suitable forms and their practical applicat ion . Obviously , however , those who desire to include the purchase price in this record , can provide a space for that purpose in the arrangement of the form . I n fact , the price can be entered as a memorandum in the Hanle space with the quantity ordered , thus avoiding the need for a specially provided space . But most users probably will prefer to UM ' the buying record and guide exclusivly as a help in deter Wining what , when , and how much to // buy . They will keep their price information separately , on some form of a " quotation record " which provides a better guide to advantageous prices . It may be helpful , in some instances , to indicate on the buying record and guide the firm from which the goods are bought . If so , a small additional space usually will suffice because nothing more than an abbreviation of the firm name will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the purchasee with an even greater economy of space , a suitable number or letter code can be worked out easily for the comparatively few concerns from which purchases will be made . But we must be sure to remember that the direct purpose of the buying record and guide is to develop dependable information regarding the rate of consumption on specific items of merchandise . As in the case of the purchase price , information as to where the goods have been or may be bought , usually is recorded more advantageously on a separate form . In fact , these elements of information are included in an adequate quotation record . Another point to remember is that additional records are needed to round out a complete stock control which finally involves the control of the entire business . The mark-up record , for example ( see Chap . XII ) is needed to tell the story of each division or department of the business in terms of value . In this connection , we will remember that an indefinite number of buying records may be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single markup record . Finally , we must remember that the story is never complete until we have the measure of actual sales against the mark established in our sales quota ; the average inventory ( by actual count ) against the stock limit we have fixed ; the total of all expenses incurred against the schedule of the expense budget ; and the profit realized against our definite aim for the entire process of profit production . CHAPTER VII A STUDY OF THE SELLING PRICE When considered in terms of the long run , " all the traffic will bear " is a sound basis for establishing the right selling price . The traffic will bear all that it can only when it is satisfied . The difference between mark-up and margin is the difference between what we try to get and what we succeed in getting . A graphic analysis of the selling price centers attention on the important difference between mark-up and margin . It also helps in understanding why mark-up tells the profit story , why margin is the only source of profit , why the customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains . We come , now , to one of the highly important elements in everyday merchandising which everyone understands , in a way ; but which few study or think about as much as really is necessary for maximum profit production . We all know well enough that the man who makes his effort count for most , is the one who does the best thinking about the apparently obvious things in his work . Nevertheless , we readily accept the apparently obvious things : is a , matter of course and sometimes do but little real 1 pinking about them . On first thought , most of us probably would say that chopping an ordinary log calls for a lot of elbow grease : 111 ( 1 very little exercise of gray matter . Yet Peter McLaren , champion wood chopper , demonstrates that it really is the brain ' work that does the business , even in wood chopping . As Mcl , aren puts it : " Every log is a problem in itself . I t h i n k out every stroke and strike where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' Ho long continued mixing of gray matter with elbow 141 ease enables this champion to cut his way through a I6 inch log iii less than two minutes , and that mixture s ; // is exactly what we find in every champion , no matter what his field may be . * WHAT IS THE RIGHT SELLING PRICE ? We can take up our study of the selling price , then , with the assurance that it pays to do some real thinking , even about its apparently obvious phases ; and we may well turn our thoughts , first , to this leading question : What is the right selling price ? Probably every merchant has his own answer to this question , an answer that he can give right off the bat . At any rate , it will prove helpful to stop reading long enough to write down your own definite answer for future consideration . What is the right selling price ? " All the traffic will bear , " comes often as the blueribbon answer . When we consider it in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the mark ; for the traffic will bear all it can , only as long as it is satisfied . Though it is necessary always to remember this tremendously important phase of the question ? that is , customer satisfaction ? we must consider it from a somewhat different angle . This is because we are now dealing with the more specific or more direct profit-producing quality of the selling price , which brings us to the proposition that the selling price is right when the margin is right . The selling price is vital , certainly ; but the vital or profit-producing part of the selling price is the margin . So our thinking immediately centers itself upon the third factor in our fundamental quartette of essentials in profit producing : Sales , stocks , margins , and expenses . THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE TRY TO GET AND WHAT WE SUCCEED IN GETTING When we consider margin to the best advantage , we must begin with the subject of mark-up . This is because , though marls-up and margin frequently are equal , they sometimes are vastly different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possible difference between what we try to get and what we actually succeed in getting . Margin is the mark-up minus the price reductions ; what is left of the mark-up when the goods have been sold . Were every item , therefore , disposed of at the originally marked retail price , mark-up and margin always would be equal . Not only does the existence of the possible difference need to be recognized clearly , as of course it is , but its possible causes need also to be recognized , understood , and constantly kept in mind . The far-reaching significance of this apparently insignificant point ( as it may be to some ) impresses itself upon us forcibly when we stop to consider what the result would be if all goods were retailed within the expected time and at the expected price . It is true , of course , that price reductions ( both expected and unexpected ) are much more of a factor in some stores and in some lines than in others ; but no store and few lines are entirely immune . Price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to get and what we finally succeed in getting occur unexpectedly to some extent , even in the bestregulated stores . Their existence and their influence on profit need therefore to be recognized clearly and taken into account as definitely as possible to assure the maximum net . That is why it is highly important to know and to keep always in mind the possible difference between mark-up and margin . SAYING WHAT WE MEAN IS HELPFUL Any consideration of mark-up and margin brings us f:01 ' to face with the well-known fact that our use of commercial terms is less standardized than it needs to he 1 n some instances , at least , we do not all mean exactly the same thing when we use exactly the same term ; and al , times we do not , really mean what the term we use walla means . Listen carefully at , almost any open dis88 METHODS OF RETAIL MANAGEMENT cussion of merchandising problems at almost any convention of retailers . The truth of the above statement is practically sure to manifest itself quickly and impressively . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being eliminated to some extent , but continues to be used occasionally as a synonym of both mark-up and margin . This is an unfortunate practice which has a really detrimental influence on the legitimate rewards of business . Besides , the term is an out and out misnomer . There is no sense in it . It needs , therefore , to be condemned to something that will put it completely and forever out of existence . Furthermore , what does gross profit mean to the average individual ? What can it mean ? What does " gross " mean to him or to her ? There probably is no need for looking up the dictionary definition to reach the conclusion that if " big , fat , shameful " profit is the idea we wish to convey , " gross profit " fills the bill very well . We all understand clearly enough just what the word " profit " means ; yet how often we hear the term misused ! We know well enough that profit is just profit and never can be anything but profit ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why " gross profit " really is an out and out misnomer . Let us say profit only when we mean profit . Let us say mark-up when we mean the difference between the cost price and the marked price ; the price we are trying to get . Let us say margin only when we mean the difference between the cost price and the selling price ; the price we actually got . This logical practice will help more than one readily realizes , on first thought , in knowing the right mark-up and getting the right margin . Meaning , of course , the margin that produces the aimed-at profit . While there are several possible pleases of mark-up - original mark-up , revised marl : ul , present mark-up , : and maintained ne:u ? k-up we will tisee 1h ( ' terni : is prininiu to the original mark-up only . Recorded price reductions // or mark-downs will show the variations from the original mark-up , of course ; and it often proves decidedly helpful to observe such variations studiously . THE SELLING PRICE IS ANALYZED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every component part clearly in mind when we wish to study anything thoroughly , we will agree quite readily that it is well worth while to make a deliberate though simple analysis of the selling price . An analysis is nothing more than " an examination of component parts separately , or in relation to the whole , " as Webster tells it ; and we want to do both , so far as the selling price is concerned . When we analyze anything , then , we simply try to learn whereof it is made . We thereby develop a clearer conception of each part separately , and how the parts are related one to another and each to the whole . We get therefrom a better and more helpful understanding of the whole works . With this thought and possibility in mind , let us examine the component parts of the selling price . Let us do this with a view to seeing how and why it will guide us to a clearer vision of the right mark-up . Which means , of course , a clearer vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us be sure to remember that this simple analysis will apply equally well to the price of a single article , any group of articles , or an entire stock of merchandise . The principle remains exactly the same whether applied to one. , to a few , to many , or to all . As the logical first step in any analysis is to separate he thing to be analyzed into the fewest possible number of parts , let us ask ourselves : Into what two parts can a selling price be divided ? But , as we remember the difference between mark-up and margin , we realize that ; we must know whether the question pertains to the , trot/ ( ( / price ( the asked price , // what we are trying to get ) or to the selling price proper ( the received price , what we actually got ) . Let us start with the former , as we always must do in actual practice . We then can follow with the various divisions indicated in the accompanying diagram , and thus consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the selling price . THE MARKED PRICE IS WHAT WE TRY TO GET In view of starting with the marked price our question becomes , first : Into what two parts can the marked price be divided ? The answer is stated in the form of an equation : 1 1 . Marked price equals merchandise cost plus mark-up. ( $1 equals 60 cents plus 40 cents ) Self-evident ? Of course it is . But the simplicity of the fact does not lessen the degree of its significance . // It involves the all-important element of mark-up , you know . Then , taking another two-part division of the marked price , we have : 2 . Marked price equals selling price plus price reduction . ( $1 equals 90 cents plus 10 cents ) That , too , is self-evident . One reason for mentioning it is that it belongs in the picture , like land in a landscape . Its importance looms a bit , however , when the equation is changed to read : Marked price minus price reduction equals selling price . ( $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly why price reductions need close watching ; yes , even to the point of careful recording with a view to sensing promptly the significance of any variation in trend . Obviously , no variation can exist without a cause . The cause of a shift in price reductions might be found , for example , in a change in the store 's buying efficiency , a change in its selling efficiency , a change in its customer group , or in a combination of these . Important ? It certainly is ! But if , most happily , we should have no price reduction , we get the equation of perfection , which reads : 3 . Marked price equals selling price . ( $1 equals $1 ) And that is the joyous condition always to be hoped for , if not invariably to be expected . It is reasonably safe to assume , however , especially when the analysis applies to style lines or to any stock as a whole , that some degree of price reductions or mark-downs is about as inevitable as the proverbial death and taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never is sold , well , that simply represents a price reduction of a full 100 per cent . We therefore continue our analvsis of the selling price on the basis of its being represented by the variation of ' the // second equation marked price minus price reduction equals selling price ? and as indicated by the unnumbered section of the diagram . This section is , of course , the same as the selling price portion of the second section . It is repeated in the diagram merely to show that the subsequent analysis is based on the assumption that the selling price proper ? the received price ? is the only source of merchandising income , and that it usually nets less in the aggregate than the total marked price . Realizing this will help us to center our thoughts effectively upon the significant fact that little old P. R. ( price reductions ) , in the broad sense of including all that we tried to get , but did not get , stands out prominently as a shoal that wrecks many a hope for profit . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the real selling price ? the effective selling price the selling price proper . For a twodivision analysis , suppose we say : 4 . Selling price equals total outlay ( total cost ) plus profit . ( 90 cents equals 88 cents plus 2 cents ) Is that correct ? Well , when we consider that the cost of the goods sold represents an outlay that is quite as essential in the making of a sale as is the cost of doing business , the equation must stand approved . I n the final analysis any business is , of course , nothing more than a matter of income and outlay ; and its commercial net is found only through a summing-up of all of its inocomes and all of its outlays . Furthermore , our merchandising income can be nothing more than the total selling price . Merchandising profit is , then , merely the difference between total selling price and total outlay . Deal managerial ability is required , however , in knowing definitely and positively just what the total selling price and the total outlay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finest points of the game center about the fact that outlay is both direct and indirect ; visible and invisible . There is also , of course , the invisible influence of good will on income . But a highly significant point of difference is found between invisible income and invisible outlay . The former can become effective only through the selling price , if at all . The latter is effective whenever and whereever business is done . Merely to emphasize the well-known existence of a dividing line ? a commercial equator which separates the profit zone from the loss zone ? we include the improbably possible equation : 5 . Selling price equals total outlay or total cost . ( 90 cents equals 90 cents ) Then , should the unfortunately more probable possibility of a total outlay in excess of the total income be encountered , we have the equation of commercial anemia which reads : 6 . Selling price equals total outlay or total cost minus loss . ( $1.04 minus 14 cents equals 90 cents ) In contrast with this anemic selling price , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fourth equation : Selling price equals total outlay ( total cost ) plus profit . But we must be sure to remember that the measure of the health is to be found only in that small segment of the diagram which is decorated with the dollar sign . Then , making another two-part division of the selling price , we have : 7 . Selling price equals merchandise cost plus margin . ( 90 cents equals 60 cents plus 30 cents ) Recognizing merchandise cost as the delivered or landed cost of the goods bought ( invoice price plus transportation ) ; and knowing that margin is the total cost of doing business ( expense ' ) plus profit , we arrive at the all-important four-division analysis : // 8 . Selling price equals invoice price plus transportation plus cost of doing business plus profit . And there we have , of course , the component parts of the wholesome selling price which we all know so well ; but which , nevertheless , are worthy of careful and deliberate consideration now and then as a golden text in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our diagram ? our " graphic analysis of the selling price " ? is prepared with no thought of representing suitable proportions for any given store , or for any specific item or line . Its purpose is two-fold : 1 . To help us keep more clearly in mind the component parts of the selling price which must be included in the marked price , together with all phases of price reduction , if a profit is to be realized . 2 . To direct our attention to possible happenings that may and often do interfere with the production of the aimed-at profit . The diagram therefore contains more sections or divisions representing possible situations , than can apply at any one time . The extras are included to remind us of possibilities rather than probabilities . And the fact that they are merely possibilities is , after all , the outstanding reason why they need special study and particular watching . A similar diagram , representing equations 1 , 7 and 8 only , should suffice for practical application in almost any store . Eery merchant who likes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be sure to construct such a diagram with proportions that picture accurately the situation in his own business . As a line 6 ; i inches long will give 100 points of ; f 6-inch length , we readily see how easy it is to draw a rough diagram in accurate proportion . Those who start by making a diagram to represent the situation for the store as a whole , Will be practically sure to follow with a separate diagram for each of the most important merchandise divisions . The ( profit-making helpfulness of such a simple analysis , especially When made to stand out boldly through the pie96 METHODS OF RETAIL MANAGEMENT ture provided by a diagram of accurate proportions , will become increasingly apparent to whatever degree it is applied studiously , that is , thinkingly . But whether or not we use the diagram , we are bound to recognize the helpfulness that results from reminding ourselves frequently of the vital fact that our mark-up must include : 1 . All price reductions . 2 . All cost of doing business , which includes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other words ? and this is a good way to look at it ? the mark-up must cover all phases of price reduction and the necessary margin to produce the desired profit . MARGIN IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF PROFIT The right mark-up plays its important part in our planning for profit , then , because it leads to the margin which is the direct and only source of realized profit . Of course we all know well enough that the desired profit must be planned into the mark-up , together with ample provision for price reductions and every element of the cost of doing business , including stock shortages and all forms of invisible expense . And we all know , too , that we need every available helpful guide in the accomplishment of this great merchandising feat which , together with reaching a suitable sales quota , stands as the supreme test of merchandising ability . New possibilities for the profitable application of recorded information in their own stores , are being discovered right along by those who are well into the habit of working with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the farther one goes , if on the right track , the more ways he finds to make his figures helpful in his job of profit producing . In spite of this , however , some seem to rent:tin quite firm in their belief that about : Ill they need the way of figureinformation is just enough to help then ) get by on income tax reports . . to in of this tvpe after listening at a manageA // ment conference to a discussion of the various factors that influence profit via the margin , came out with this pithy comment : " What 's the use of all this monkey business ? You buy as low as you can and sell as high as you can and do as much of it as you can , and that 's all there is to it . If you have horse sense enough , you 're all right ; if you have n't , you 're all wrong . That 's what I see in business . " The value of his contribution lies in serving us as an effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business is to increase the quantity and quality of our commercial horse sense . Unless it does just that , it falls down on the biggest and most important part of its job . Our analysis and study of the selling price is obviously futile unless it helps us to work more effectively in the realization that margin , not mark-up , is the direct and only source of profit ; unless it helps us in doing a better job of " buy as low as you can and sell as high as you can and do as much of it as you can , " as considered in terms of the long run . THE CUSTOMER DETERMINES THE MARGIN But let us be sure to remember , also , that our margin is not determined by our figures , nor by our figure-information ; between which , incidentally , a real distinction exists . Figure-information will help , but that is all . In the last analysis , it always is what we are able to get ? riot wl u t t t t r figure-information indicates we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is that our customer is the one who always has the final say-so on what we are able 1 o get . Merchants set the mark-up ; customers determine the margin . However , this in no way indicates that our murk-up and margin figures are any the less helpful , or our sales efforts any the less important . On the contrary , it AIM s why every available helpful influence must he used to the best advantage possible to guide us in getting our customers to make . their decisions in accordance wit h our commercial needs . // Of course a variety of influences come into play in our arrival at the marked price , and our customer 's arrival at the selling price . We need to consider , for example , such factors as : 1 . The cost price of the merchandise . 2 . The goods themselves ? their utility , style and quality . 3 . The selling ability and capacity of the store . 4 . The customer demand , both active and potential . 5 . The character , extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 . The strength and attractiveness of the competition . Clearly , all of these enter into the making of the selling price ; but it never becomes a selling price , as we use the term , without the consent of the customer . The importance of knowing the right mark-up ? that is , the right Marked Price ? as nearly as we can , stands out impressively when we thoughtfully consider these wellknown and entirely obvious facts : 1 . When the price is too low , margin and profit must suffer . 2 . When the price is too high , sales and potential profit will dwindle . Perhaps no one can know definitely and positively whether a given cost price is exactly right . Perhaps no one can know definitely and positively whether a given mark-up or retail price is exactly right . But all of us can analyze the selling price , keep its component parts clearly in mind , have a well-defined aim as to profit-production and know , through the aid of Our records , how close we come to hitting the bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve us as an effective guide . It will help to bring us increasingly nearer to knowing the right mark-up and getting the right margin . That procedure will keep us reminded of the pivotal fact that only trough the right mark-up is the right margin available ; and that only through the right margin is the ninrrrl-at pr ? , /it obtainable . CHAPTER VIII HOW A BETTER EXPENSE BUDGET LEADS TO GREATER RETAIL PROFIT The purpose of the expense budget is to control expense , rather than to reduce it . Expense is properly controlled when it harmonizes with the other essential parts of the profit-making program ; when the expenditures produce t re desired profit , under the existing conditions , at a consistent or logical , cost. , , , It is not the amount of expense that counts , but its relationship to results . Expense budgets center the attention to the manager On expenditures before they are made , and ' provide a basis for comparing accomplishment with airn ; for comparing actual results with planned results . Accounting analyzes the expense that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incurred . A good budget system has an advantageous influence on , and is advantageously influenced by , the accounting system . The one helps the other . The great highlight always to be remembered is this : So far as the internal influences of the store are concerned , merchandising profit depends invariably upon four essential elements ? upon four vital organs of the business ? upon sales , stocks , margins and expenses . These must be in sound condition , separately ; and they must function in harmonious relationship with each other ; " for this is the law and the profit . ' " Every phase of fundamental planning for retail profit is founded squarely upon these four essential elements which , from the standpoint of looking ahead , usually are known as sales quotas , stock limits , mark-ups and expense budgets . Now , as the first three-elements in this basic quartet of retail planning have been discussed in preceding chapters , // we are ready to take up the " last , but not least , " the expense budget . Since practically every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his cost of doing business , the leading question has become : Can the expense budget be put to better use ? We turn our thoughts , therefore to " how a better expense budget leads to greater retail profit . " A BRIEF SUMMARY OF CHIEF PURPOSES At this points it is well to remind ourselves that we still are dealing ' kith , the planning phase of the process of profit production . We continue to consider the job of looking ahead the : ; ' most profitable operation of the business , , the job of formulating definitely the four basic essentials , , to assure ' the , greatest possible reward for our business risks and efforts . A big portion of our planning job is , of course , to see that each basic element is sound in itself , and that each is geared properly to function effectively and harmoniously with the others toward reaching our definite aim in the production of profit . " Unity of purpose and unity of action " are quite as necessary in the vital organs of the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aptly of cooperation : It simply is a case of " all pulling on the same rope at the same time in the same direction . " But the direction must be right , of course , to bring us to the desired goal . We must know whether or not we are pulling in the right direction ; and we can not know that unless we have a definite and clearly recognized goal ; the more definite and the more clearly recognized , the better . So a carefully determined goal is essential . And we always must bear in mind the particularly important and well-known fact . that the real goal of our business is profit , not sales . // To bear in mind . Ah , there 's the rub ! Merely to recognize profit , not sales , as our commercial target is as child 's play ; but to bear that obvious fact in mind sufficiently to avoid sidetracking and to keep thoughts and efforts ever on the main line , that 's a man 's job ! We all know , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is found in definite or specific planning . We know that reaching our aim in profit production requires such planning for the four vital organs of the business , individually and collectively . For the sake of a helpful review , let us therefore consider a brief summary of the underlying purpose of each basic factor in planning for retail profit : 1 . Sales quota : To establish a consistent volume of sales for which to strive . 2 . Stock limit : To determine the reasonable minimum of investment in merchandise with which the planned volume of sales can be reached with reasonable cost and effort . 3 . Mark-up : To assure an adequate margin , to assure the safe return of all expenditures , and to bring the aimedat profit . 4 . Expense budget : To safeguard the margin and its small vulnerable spot commonly known as profit . HOW THE EXPENSE BUDGET AFFECTS THE PROFIT PROGRAM Let us now take a moment to consider briefly the influence of the expense budget on the other basic factors in planning for retail profit . First , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the making of sales requires both a suitable setting and an effective driving force ; a place for selling , as well as the activity of selling . We know , too , that both of these cost money . The extent to which we are able and willing to provide the necessary fiends is bound to influence the character of the set 1 ing and the power of the driving force ; and these ,
