This makes the fourth charge facing Arbuckle , two are for murder and the other two for manslaughter . The verdict said : " We , the Coroner 's jury , find that the said Virginia Rappe , aged 25 , single , residence Los Angeles , came to her death on Sept. 9 at the Wakefield Sanitarium " from the ruiiture of an internal organ . and that a con-. tributing cause was peritonitis . The verdict added : " Said rupture was caused by the application of some force which , from the evidence submitted , we believe was applied by one Roscoe Arbuckle , and the undersigned jtIrors , therefore , charge the said Roscoe Arbuckle with the- crime of manslaughter . " We recommend that the District At , torney of the City and County of San Francisco , in conjunction with the Grand Jury , the Chief of Police and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recurrence of affairs similar to the one in which this young woman lost her life , so that San Francisco shall not be made the rendezvous of the debauchee and the gangster . " That the findings of the Coroner 's Jury were phrased in much more direct and ' forceful language than had been anticipated by Arbuckle 's array of counsel Was plainly manifest . Only Charles Brennan of Arbuckle 's counsel was present when the verdict was read , and he made a hasty copy with which he rushed off to Frank Dominguez . Arbuckle personally showed signs of a heavy slump in spirit . During the long period of waiting he had been buoyed up by his attorneys . The comparative unimportance of the ' customary formal verdict of a coroner 's jury was impressed upon his mind . Yet when the jurymen filed into the inquest room he leaned forward nervously , and while the document was being read by the Coroner and his name was announced as causing the death of Miss Rappe the comedian 's lips twitched ' nervously and his face took on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the liquor at Arbuckle 's party , one of the interesting side developments of fhe case , was taken over today by Robert H. iVIcCormack , the new Assistant United States Attorney General in charge of prohibition law violations . Arbuckle 's denial that he bought the liquor in the Hotel St. Francis started McCormack to work on the theory that it was brought from the accused actor 's home at Hollywood in his automobile . Under the prohibition law vehicles used for the illicit transportation of liquor may be confiscated , and if it develops that the liquor was brought here in Arbuckle 's $26,000 machine it will be seized .
