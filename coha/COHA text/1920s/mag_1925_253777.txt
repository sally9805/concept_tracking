In the House of Commons , as Conservative member of North St. Pancras , London , is blind Captain Ian Frazer . His wife is his pilot and " parliamentary secretary " ; but , according to the rules of the House , she can not accompany him to those parts specifically reserved for members . Mr. Speaker Whitley came to the rescue . With great tact and courtesy , he issued last week to Mrs. Frazer a special permit enabling her to go anywhere , except on " the Floor of the House .
