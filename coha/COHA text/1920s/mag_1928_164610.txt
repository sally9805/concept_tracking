Light to live by , gas to cook with , power to work with , trolley cars to ride upon-do these fundamental necessities cost more than they should ? <P> Senator Walsh of Montana , iron-grey ramrod of the public service , contracted the idea , following the Senate 's investigation of Samuel Insull 's political generosity , that the public may sometimes be used by some men as a private utility ; that the financial structure , service rates and political activities of public utility corporations would bear investigation . He proposed a resolution to that effect in the Senate . <P> Senator George of Georgia deflected Senator Walsh 's plan . At his suggestion the Senate , instead of voting to make the investigation itself , directed the Federal Trade Commission to take the job ( TIME , Feb. 27 ) . <P> The Commission began its hearings in March . In point of the volume of testimony taken , at least , the Commission had silenced criticism of itself . Public prints have published masses of the material collected , have made much strong comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month and presented exhibits . But the Commission has reserved its opinion of the public utility companies until all evidence is in . <P> Last week the first phase of the Commission 's investigation was completed . A long parade of publicity agents and " public relations " executives had passed before the investigators . Their testimony showed : <P> That the public utility companies of the U. S. have been organized as associations to work for a common end . <P> That this common end is to propagate the idea that private operations of public utilities is better than State operation ; and the corollary idea that State operation is " bolshevistic . " <P> That the propaganda has been spread in uniform manner , as follows : <P> 1 ) Rewriting public school textbooks and obtaining their adoption throughout the land . <P> 2 ) " Taking care of " teachers and professors who agree to teach that private operation is good , State operation bad . <P> 3 ) Placing advertisements in newspapers , and explaining to the newspapers that to oppose private operation will be to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at seats of government to combat state ownership projects . <P> 5 ) Circulating literature , including a " catechism " for school children and doggerel verse . <P> The mass of the evidence did not show that the utility companies had proceeded along lines very different from the lines followed by other advertisers of ideas . More effort was spent in boosting the private-operation idea than in knocking the competitive , " bolshevistic " idea of State ownership . <P> Only the mediums employed seemed unusual-school books , college lectures-and these the utility men explained by saying they had found " hostile " forces at work in the schools . They named some things called the League for Industrial Democracy , the Public Ownership League , the People 's Legislative Service , etc. , etc . The annual aggregate outlay of such organizations , however , was reported to be some $50,000 as compared with about $900,000 by the public utility companies for lobbying and propaganda .
