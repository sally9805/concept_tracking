txt Dislike for human society and affection for animals has led Mrs. Sidmon of 18 West Fifty-third Street to make a will in which she will leave all her considerable fortune to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for a hospital for animals . It will be the largest of its kind in the world , set in wide grounds somewhere in the suburbs of New York , a place unique . The hospital is to be known as the Isabel Memorial , and in it will be a bust of herself in marble on a pedestal which will contain her ashes . Over the door will be carved the words that explain her purpose in making this unusual gift ? " The more I saw of people , the more I thought of dogs . " There was little to indicate a tendency to misanthropy in Mrs. as sh smilingly discussed her will in her home yesterday . She told of ' the inscription , of the . bust and of how she arrived at her decision after long deliberation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she even contemplates the destruction after her death of her pets and a painting of herself by a French artist she was mute . Inquiries as to the size of her bequest she also turned away with a smile . " Just say it is all I have in the world , or will have from trusts that will come to me , " she said . " Even my jewels will be sold and the money given to the memorial fund . " Mrs. is tall , of a rather stately dignity and charm , of a manner shown in the full length portrait by Francois Flameng which hangs in her drawing room . " I can do anything with animals , " she said , " and mine have always been so ' well trained that I could take them to a friend 's home for bridge and know that they would not be an annoyance . Indeed . " she laughed , " I have been told that it was a pity I could not have trained children , they would have keen so well mannered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had thought of doing something of the kind for years , and she thought at her age it was time she made her will . " Oh , yes . I am getting old , " she said , smiling again . But there was no trace of age in her face , and her hair showed not a sign of gray . " My husband has nothing to do with this , " she said . " It is not his money . It is mine . It is all my affair . " When she had finally determined that a hospital for animals would best serve her purpose , she went abroad . While in Rome she asked Enrico Quattrini , the Papal sculptor , who has his studio in the grounds of the Vatican , to make her bust . Her husband was largely responsible for this , she said , for she had never had a portrait , and shrank from the idea of having herself done in marble . But she consented at last , and a contract was made with Quattrini by which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was delayed , but will arrive in this country in a few days . " I posed for nine days and it was ' the hardest thing I ever aid , " she said . That was in the Vatican grounds , during the life of Pope Benedict , who was even then becoming 111 . The sculptor was working on a monument to Cardinal Rampolla , who had died , and she was captivated by the- delicate work Quattrini had lone in chiseling the - lace of the Cardinal 's garb out of stone . She determined to have the lower part of her bust also covered by this lace work , instead of the conventional , way in which the busts were usually finished , and bought some rare lace which she draped about herself and which was reproduced with fidelity by the chisel . We went back there some , time ago , for we hoped that the bust would bo ready , " she said , " but it was not finished . I was ' disinclined to go on with it , half thought of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really liked it . It was beautifully done . We were anxious to get it as soon as possible , and Quanttrini really interrupted his work on Rampolla 's magnificent monument to finish mine . They were both there together , being chiseled out side by side . We had , grown up together in a way/ and it seemed a shame to separate us. ' she added with a smile . ' As , for the ihemorio.l , " she went on , " I have always been very fond of animals , and dogs werb my favorites . Ther is really no good place to take animals when they are sick in New York , although the Society , for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was always most kind and considerate whenever I took any of my pets there . I have always been accumulating stray dogs , it seems . mongrels and all kinds , but most of them have died . Now I only have one and my parrot , who will probabjy live to be 100 years old , much longer than myself . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , have him , and perhaps mistreat him , and when I die he will be chloro'formed . " Stray animals have always come to me , everywhere I went . Up in Montreal . where I think there are more stray dogs than in any European city I have ever seen , they used to wait for me on the street because I would take them to a butcher 's and have them fed . They are , . . ' wlie little , s , nimais , ** street dogs . For , a time we lived on an estate et ? Manhasset next to Louis Sherry's. although we . never built a large house there because . I found that masquitos gave me malaria . But while we . were there my chauffeur , ? a kind herted Irishman who liked dogs , too , used to bring all sorts of animals . home with him . One was a plIppy which started out to be , a Boston bull , " " but developed the head and shoulders of a bloodhound When . he grew-up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds used to take hits down to the village and make him fight other dogs . He was known as Mrs. 's Mickey and was never beaten . But I was furious when I found out dbout the fights . " Mrs. took up the Aubject of an animal hospital with W. K. Horton , general manager of the S. P. C. A .. last October . and to make sure that her will would be iron-clad , that nobody could break it , she had the , firm of Barry , Wainwright . Thacher &; Symmers of 59 Wall Street , the society 's attorneys , draw it up . Under it her entire fortune , with the trusts that will come to her from her mother and another relative , will go to the animal hospital , and her jewelry will be sold under the direction of the executors . The bust by Quattrini will be . placed in the entrance hall where visitors will see it . Under it will be carved " The butt of Isabel " and her ashes will be placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Isabel Memorial . " and the Inscription to show her relative regard for human beings and dogs . She does not want anything of herself left . The portrait by Flameng she may have destroyed that it will not fall into the hands of strangers . She will give It to the St. Louie ! Art Museum  --  her home originally was in St. Louis ? if they will agree now to accept it after her death , and keep it always , something which museums seldom wish to bind themselves to do , she explained , or she may decide to have that also placed in the memorial . But her ' present intention leans toward destruction . Mr. Horton said last night that he did not know how large the memorial hospital would be , as that would be , determined by the size of the le to do everything which the society delegacy , but he understood that it would be ample sired  --  to build the largest and best an -- mai hospital in the world . " Mrs. 's bequest will enable us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but have , ve ? had the means to accomplish . The hospital will be somewhere in the suburbs , where there will% many acres of ground .
