The completion of the first year since the twelve-hour day was " abolished " in the steel mills brought forth last week a number of surveys of the results . The conclusions arrived at , although different , of course , for different companies and localities , were roughly these : <P> 1 ) That the twelve-hour day in the steel industry has almost completely disappeared . <P> 2 ) That there are still a great many men , however , who work more than eight hours . <P> 3 ) That the seven-day week is just as common as formerly , if not more so , especially where the eight-hour day has replaced the twelve-hour day . However , in most cases , the men are allowed to take one day off a week if they desire . <P> 4 ) That the increase of personnel required and of cost has been slight , due to the superior efficiency of men working shorter hours . <P> 5 ) That in many cases the same amount of production has been maintained with no increase of workmen , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have aided in improving morale . <P> 7 ) That in some sections men complain because the amount of work offered is inadequate .
