The text of the secret naval agreement between Great Britain and France ( TIME , Aug. 13 ) was partially exposed and its principles were vigorously denounced , last week , in a point blank note from the U. S. State Department to the British Foreign Office . <P> Seldom or never before have President Coolidge and Secretary of State Kellogg collaborated on an epistle of such scathing vigor . What they said , in the necessarily polite " language of diplomacy , " may be impolitely but exactly paraphrased : <P> " John Bull , you refused to swallow our sort of disarmament pill at the Coolidge Naval Limitations Parley in Geneva ( TIME , June 27 to Aug. 15. 1927 ) . We offered to limit all classes of ships . You offered , instead , another sort of pill , suggesting that we limit only the larger naval craft and leave unlimited small cruisers and small submarines . <P> " Now , John , you know that your naval bases in all parts of the world enable you to use small ships of short cruising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided with bases , and so we must have larger ships of longer cruising radius . When you propose to limit large ships and leave small ones unlimited , you are proposing to limit only the ships we chiefly need , while leaving unlimited the ships you chiefly need . <P> " Our answer to your proposal at Geneva was NO . Now your new secret agreement with France lines her up behind you in presenting to us once more this same proposal . Our answer is still NO . " <P> " Even More Objectionable . " Specific , technical points made in the Coolidge-Kellogg note , and of vital importance , are set forth in the following excerpts from the note : <P> " The government of the United States has received from His Majesty 's Government a communication summarizing the understanding reached between the British and French governments as to a basis of naval limitation . . . . Unfortunately the Franco-British agreement appears to fulfill none of the conditions which , to the American government , seem vital . <P> " . . . The Franco-British agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyers , or submarines of 600 tons or less . . . . Such cruisers constitute the largest number of fighting ships now existing in the world . <P> " The American Government seeks no special advantage . . . but clearly can not permit itself to be placed in a position of manifest disadvantage . ... At the Three Power Conference in Geneva in 1927 . . . the limitation proposed by the British delegation on this smaller class of cruisers was so high that the American delegation considered it , in effect , no limitation at all . This same proposal is now presented in a new and even more objectionable form which still limits large cruisers which are suitable to American needs , but frankly places no limitation whatever on cruisers carrying guns of six inches or less in calibre . . . .
