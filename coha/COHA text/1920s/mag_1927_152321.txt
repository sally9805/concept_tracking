COUNTERPOINT-Josephine Daskam Bacon-John Day ( $2.50 ) . Ten years ago the publication of Author Bacon 's latest novel held vast interest for novel readers . Here was a lady whose characters were always engaging ; no nastiness could be found in Author Bacon 's bestsellers , just nice people doing nice things . Now , with the publication of Counterpoint after ten years , a few readers , remembering the old books , will be struck with the way a similar article produces a different reaction . Over this story of Will Stickney , of Naomi Lestrange ( whom he marries , with whom he parts after vicissitudes , to whom he returns at the last ) , of many highly imaginary musical celebrities , there is a heavy coating of dust which almost obscures the few virtues which Author Bacon , as an artist , possesses . Whether literature has improved or changed in the last ten years , can not here be decided ; but certainly it has changed its channel , and Mrs. Bacon 's writings , once islands , are now dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
