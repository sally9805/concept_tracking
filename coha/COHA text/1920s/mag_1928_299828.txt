The Cabinet of Prime Minister Andrei Liapchev fell , last week , for the usual reason : trouble with the belligerent Macedonian Minority . <P> A few days later His Majesty Tsar Boris called upon M. Liapchev to form another cabinet , for the usual reason : after other statesmen have had their try at assembling a Government , they are usually willing to compromise again on Liapchev . M. Liapchev duly formed another cabinet , but it , too , fell .
