txt So far as the Army is concerned , the curtain was rung down this evening on*the preparations for the Navy contest in New York on Saturday . Except for a signal practice . Naiii ... 11 the West Pointers will hold on the Polo Grounds field tomorrow : afternoon , the Army 's guns are silenced. and the cadets are awaiting the call which will send them into their final football battle of the year . As the hour for the game draws near there is an undercurrent of feeling in the Army camp that this soldier eleven is about to find itself . Physically , some of the men on the team are in none too good condition . This is admitted by those close to the squad . No predictions of victory are forthcoming from any other than the most ardent admirers of the team , but there is a quiet confidence astir , and the general atzilospliere during the past week has shown unmistak , able signs of an improvement of the morale all around . rhe Army 's record this season does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated by reports , making- the i cadets the favorites in the betting . The West Pointers know-that this contest will be a gruelling one , for nearly every , man on the eleven has been under the Navy 's fire before and knows what to expect . Army will put its all into the contest in an effort to break the tie which exists between the two institutions in games won . In the prac:lce today only the lightest sort of work was on the proaram . The rain of the early morning had made the field soggy and there was no idea of taking any chances of a possible twisted ankle or a wrenched knee . However , Head Coach and his assistants , at the close of the preliminary drill , lined the men in a dummy scrimmage , during which every man on the squad . varsity and reserve list , got a chance to play . Reeder Kicks Well . There was a kicking drill also . Garbirch and a substitute .

Both these men booted over the ball frequently from long and short distances and with an accuracy that was pleasing to the watchers . With Bill Wood and Gill1 more sending down long spiral punts . Army 's kicking game left but little , to be desired . Head Coach did not anInounce his probable line-up for Saturday 's game . This may not be decided upon dt.finitely until the eleven goes through its final rehearsal in New York tomorrow , but the varsity lined up in practice tonight as it ran through its repertoire of plays in the signal drill las follows : I Left end . Baxter : left tackle . Mulligan ; left guard , Ellinger ; centre , Garbisch ; right guard . Farwick , right tackle . Goodman ; right end , Doyle ; quarterback , Smythe ; ? eft halfback . Hewitt : right halfback , Gillmore ; fullback , Wood . It seems settled that Doyle will start at right end , where much doubt has existed for some time Doyle 's last performance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is light . weighing but 150 pounds . but makes up for a lot of missing poundage by his aggressiveness and heady play . He is Playing his second season , having been a substitute last year . Doyle played football at Syracuse High School before entering the Military Academy . While Captain Mulligan has been shelved considerably of late , his presence in the varsity line-up today is taken to mean that he will start against Navy instead of Henney , the promising substitute who has been usqd more frequently of late at the left tackle position . The only other uncertainty exists at left halfback , where it is thought that Tiny Hewitt , former Pittsburgh star , may be chosen by the Mentors to start against the Middies . Ives . a star defensive baelz , is not in any too good condition , and Hewitt seems the logical choice in this place . Others May Play . There are other outstanding nearvarsity men who are almost certain to get into the big game at some stage , among whom are Don Storck and Frazer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steviart and Schmidt , guards ; Strohecker. centre ; aroemans , quarterback , and Dean , Daly . Bladisell and Scheiffler , ball-carrying backs . The order for the movement to the metropolis was issued today .
