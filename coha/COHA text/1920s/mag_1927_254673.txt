With the great Mississippi flood of 1927 quietly seeping into the Gulf of Mexico , attention turned toward preventing the river from ever again driving valley-dwellers from their homes in hundreds of thousands . It appears certain that the levee system will continue to carry the main burden of flood prevention , but various adjuncts to it have been insistently urged . <P> Reforestation . A frequently brought forward measure of flood-control has been reforestation . One objection to this scheme is that the Mississippi went on one of the greatest floods of its history in 1844 when the valley was thickly forested . <P> Reservoirs . A system of reservoirs in the upper reaches of streams tributary to the Mississippi would , it is claimed , absorb the spring overflow of these streams , thus catching the floods at an early stage and eliminating them . Such a system would , however , be tremendously expensive ( Dayton , Ohio , alone spent $30,000,000 on a reservoir project after the 1913 Dayton Flood ) , and would not affect rain-swollen streams at points below the reservoir sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed in a system of basins-stretches of lowlands bordering the river and surrounded by levees . These basins would be dry land in normal times , at flood period an opening would be made in the levees and the basin flooded , thus taking up some of the overflow . These basins could be owned by the Government and rented out for private farming with the understanding that they would have to be inundated in flood time . <P> Spillways . The most promising and most seriously considered flood-control method is the spillway . The Atchafalaya River is a good example of a natural spillway . It flows , roughly speaking , parallel to the Mississippi through Louisiana . By building strong levees all along its length to the Gulf it could be turned into a kind of trough which would draw off water from the Mississippi itself . In the present flood the Atchafalaya did , in a way , perform exactly this function ; unfortunately , however , it received altogether too much water so that the later stages of the flood were along the Atchafalaya , not along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were strengthened and if additional spillways were constructed at other strategic points , another flood , split into many sections , might well remain under control . The spillway system has long been advocated by the people of Louisiana , especially of New Orleans . <P> Levees . Popular confidence in the levee system has been shaken , if not destroyed , by their failure to prevent the present flood from inundating some 20,000 square miles and making homeless some 600,000 people . But expert opinion still clings to them as the backbone of flood prevention . Doubtless they will , in the future , be built higher and stronger , but , as far as can at present be determined , the levee will always carry the main burden of confining the river and to it all other methods will be not more than adjuncts , auxiliaries . Writing for the New York World Herbert C. Hoover said : " The levee system needs to be revised and strengthened and , above all , we must have some other safety devices which will relieve the strain on the levee system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for all . . . . We can not abolish the levee system . "
