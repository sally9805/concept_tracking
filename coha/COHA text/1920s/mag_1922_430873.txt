ON the quiet shore of the placid Potomac , amphitheatred by the gentle slopes of the Virginia hills , stands the majestic memorial to Abraham Lincoln , the greatest American of them all . Serene , isolated , with free distances in all directions , this white marble temple is a shrine toward which the pilgrim feet of a loyal country shall be forever turned . A Parthenon , this , builded on the acropolis of a nation 's reverence and devotion . Through storms that are war 's cataclysmic forces , through tremors that shake the legislative foundations of once-prized institutions , through terrific winds that change the current of men 's minds , and through the genial warmth of an all-benign sun of progress that succeeds the strain and the waste of molding powers , firm as the eternal hills , this temple shall stand , immortal by reason of the divinity of character of this man who shaped events to his purpose and to God 's . Across the river , in the wooded beauty of the hills , just past the white pillars of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gave the last full measure of devotion that no hand might trail their starry banner in the dust , gleams the curving sweep of the Memorial Amphitheatre , like a companion shrine whose dedication , also , is to memory ? a memory that reaches out and crowns the white temple below it on the river 's shore . In the opposite direction noble comradeship is found , in the towering , commanding obelisk sacred to the memory of the illustrious Washington , who dared to create what Lincoln dared to save . And the glorious Capitol , that embodies a government of the people , for the people , and by the people , forever looks for inspiration toward the white shrine on the river 's edge . Lonely is this memorial in spite of worthy companionings ; lonely as was the understanding heart of the man to whose memory it was erected . Nothing constructed by the hand of man approaches it even remotely , and this isolation works its inevitable spell of reverence . The soft blowing of myriads of trees that all but conceal the shrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water in the long , reflecting pool that mirrors in its shallow depths the triple beauty of snowy cloud and bordering foliage and shimmering marble , the noiseless flowing of the Potomac , and the white glory that leaps in the wide cascade of steps that rise to the unenclosed entrance , fade from memory as the temple unfolds like a white blossom to full bloom before the eyes of one who would for a space worship greatness there . Doric are the pillars that sweep with the  | regularity of . crested waves on an even shore about the chamber of the memorial . Doric , and the keynote of the temple is struck in that order of architecture whose only attributes are strength and simplicity . The pilgrim pauses for a brief space in this majestic hall of fluted columns , and the mysterious spell of great height and great width engulfs him , even as at night the galaxy of the heavens transforms his pride to true humility with the eternal query of , " What is man that Thou art mindful of him ? " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silence and the white wonder of marble that glorify the place cathedral-wise are felt and seen . In that unadorned chamber sits the lonely , potent figure of a lonely , potent man , and draws the pilgrim 's footsteps nearer and nearer . Against the rear wall , directly opposite the wide entrance , is this figure . Every lineament of his serious , patient face marks him for fame 's own ? this one-time rail-splitter , who by sheer force of character and genius held with highest honor the highest place this country grants to any man . So lifelike is this huge statue that it almost seems as though it must speak , must utter forth new prophecies in this hour of rehabilitation of the world . Serene , poised , patient , the lips are dumb , but the figure is vocal with Lincoln 's passion for truth and honesty that underlay his humility , strength , simplicity , charity , gentleness , high intelligence , and justice . Some one said of him that reason and emotion were joined in him like form and color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human spirit blesses the pilgrim standing in the presence of this kindly , patient man in whom a divine wisdom had her dwelling-place . Simple and strong as clean winds on snow-covered , lonely mountain peaks is the superb sincerity of this man , enveloping and ennobling all who come in touch with it . Reluctantly the pilgrim leaves the main chamber of the memorial and moves between the Ionic columns that transform the northern end of the hall into a sanetuary for one of the mural bands that runs in mellow colors above the " Second Inaugural " cut into the wall beneath it . The triune beauty of that greatest of the longer speeches floods his mind once more , while his lifted eyes discover anew its trinity of meaning in the allegory whose rich , subdued tones of dull blues and reds , soft browns and tans , are as mellow as the ripened powers of the great statesman . In a grove of cypress trees , that symbol of eternity , he sees the angel of truth bind the North and South in an indissoluble union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while on the left , through family life , Fraternity develops the productivity of the earth , and on the right Charity offers the water of life to the halt and blind and cares for the orphans whom destiny makes the heaviest burden bearers of war 's waste and destruction . Unity , fraternity , charity , and the mind 's eye turns to the inscription and sees it whole at last . These were the principles that held Lincoln steady in his undeviating , heart-breaking purpose to complete what he had begun , trusting ever that he was on the side of God . His was a vision that circumstance and expedient could not blur to his own undoing . True to himself , he was true to that great cause in whose service he had enrolled himself . As the pilgrim crosses to the southern end of the memorial hall , an exact duplicate in scheme of the one he has just left , his eyes fall upon the most perfect piece of English in the world today ; cut in simple , strong letters in the marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are familiar enough , but somehow , in this place of memory , they take on added significance , and the pilgrim 's eyes are moist as he lifts them to the mural band above . There he sees in the same enchanted grove , beneath the same symbol of eternity , the chains stricken from the slave , who thus comes into an unfamiliar but guarded freedom . Justice and the Law , for which Lincoln had a consuming passion , are pictured to the left , while to the ' right Immortality sets her seal of approval upon this emancipator who fearlessly declared that no nation could endure half-free and half-slave . For a brief space the pilgrim pauses as he returns to the central chamber with its serious , compelling statue of Lincoln , his whole being lifted up , transfigured , by the power of unsullied greatness ; in his heart a new devotion to his citizenship in a land that knows so well how to honor its citizens . He sees the white wonder of the whole chamber , whose only colorful thread is the murals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epic grandeur of one man 's life . He feels the whole structure as an unadorned , perfected temple with ineffable pageants , in brief , richtoned friezes , of the procession of the qualities of the man whom the years have united to call great . The light falls softly in this chamber through the  | translucent marble slabs in the flat roof , and more light floods the space from the open facade . The spirit of Lincoln , that knew no darkness , shines in that light with a tender , gracious strength and quiet dignity . Lincoln , the man of the people ; yes , but a man inspired to sate a great people in a great crisis , coming as all great leaders do come from the wilderness to shape a new age . A root out of a dry ground was he , but out of that appalling barrenness finding somehow God and His purpose , a willing instrument in Divine hands . His strong , rugged name was one not horn to die .  |         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
