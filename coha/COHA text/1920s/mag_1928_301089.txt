Certain friends of Prof. William Lyon Phelps spluttered with alarm when they read last week that he had been installed honorary pastor of Calvary Baptist Church . They envisioned the famed teacher , talker , critic , nodding meek approval on the platform of Calvary Baptist of the harsh fundamentalisms of Dr. John Roach Straton , pastor-in-chief . <P> Another glance , however , reassured them it was Calvary Baptist Church in New Haven , not in Manhattan . <P> Prof. Phelps took his text for his inaugural sermon from Thornton Wilder ( The Bridge of San Luis Key ) rather than scripture . " Wilder says that a revival of religion must be accompanied by a revival of rhetoric . . . . The public finds it difficult to forgive Arnold Bennett for writing trash when he is capable of much better work . "
