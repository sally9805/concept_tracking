No longer does the voice of God , as it is reputed once to have done , drum across the sky in the sound of storm or make a friendly whisper in the wilderness . Angels come to earth no more and the night is never filled now with the strange chime of their singing . But last week the voice of one of God 's servants ran through the sky like an invisible lightening , came , out of many boxes , into the parlors of many U. S. homes . God 's servant , Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick , was preaching his sermon through a microphone at the first service of the National Church of the Air . When his sermon ceased , hymns and anthems , sung by a quartet , came out of the parlor radio sets . <P> In 1923 the Greater New York Federation of Churches began its radio activities by broadcasting Bishop Herbert Shipman 's sermon from a public meeting in Manhattan . Since then the Federation has broadcast daily morning prayers , a weekly Youths Radio Conference , a weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vesper service . Last autumn , the sermons of Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick , of Union Theological Seminary and of the Park Avenue Baptist Church in Manhattan , were added to the vesper services . Last week , these were formally organized as the National Church of the Air . A representative of the radio committee of the Federation is now touring western cities to stimulate interest in the National Church of the Air , perhaps to enlarge its audience which is reached now through 13 stations .
