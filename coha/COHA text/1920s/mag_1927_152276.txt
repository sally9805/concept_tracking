An . Italian woman returned last week to Italy with two sorry souvenirs after a six-week visit to the U. S. She was Miss Luigia Vanzetti , aboard the S. S. Mauretania , with two urns . In one urn were half the ashes of Bartolomeo Vanzetti , her electrocuted , anarchist brother ; in the other , half the ashes of Nicola Sacco , her brother 's electrocuted , anarchist friend-murderers both , in the eyes of Massachusetts . <P> Miss Vanzetti said she would inter the ashes in Italian soil . <P> The ashes which remained in the U. S. were left in Boston with Mrs. Rose Sacco , whose plans for them were indefinite .
