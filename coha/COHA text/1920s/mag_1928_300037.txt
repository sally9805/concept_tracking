" One Brave Chinese . " Chang Tsung-chang , off to the Chinese battlefront , waves good-bye to 20 wives and concubines , promising to come back victorious . Anemic Westerners can only admire Chang 's courage and verve . <P> " Ladies whom he began marrying young , when he was a gang coolie , include Chinese , Japanese , Koreans , Russians and Mongolians . Win or lose , that 's a brave Chinese . " <P> Thus exalted famed Hearst columnist-editor Arthur Brisbane , last week , when the notorious , cruel , rapacious General Chang Tsung-chang put his back to the Great Wall of China and prepared for a last stand against the immensely superior armies of the new Chinese Nationalist Government , which now claims to dominate all China ( TIME , Aug. 13 ) . <P> Within 72 hours Last Stander Chang 's army of 50,000 was put to absolute rout by Nationalist &; Mohammedan General Pai Chung-hsi , who took 20,000 prisoners , and barely missed capturing Polygamist Chang as he fled to Manchuria . Rejoicing was general , for Chang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves to lash his prisoners , an old-woman-beater and a young-woman-despoiler , a murderer , treacherous , outrageous , godless ( TIME , March 7 , 1927 ) . But , as Columnist Brisbane remarked , Chang Tsung-chang has " verve " ; and 20 wives and concubines have not rendered him " anemic . " As such he looms a potent Hearst hero . <P> ... <P> Generally speaking , the new Nationalist State continued to make good its boast of ruling all China , except Manchuria , last week . The Manchurian War Lord , Chang Hsueh-liang continued unable to join the Nationalists because of his unwilling , enforced alliance with Japan . <P> The U. S. , which was first of the Great Powers to recognize Nationalist China de facto ( TIME , Aug. 6 ) set Oct. i , 1928 last week as the tentative date for ceremonies amounting to recognition de jure . On that day U. S. Rear Admiral Yates Stirling Jr . of the U. S. Yangtze River Patrol proposes to fire a salute , off Nanking , the Nationalist Capital , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reopened and normal Sino-U . S. relations resumed . <P> Last week a mixed commission was rapidly adjusting the total sum which Nationalist China must pay because her rash soldiery sacked the U. S. Consulate a year and a half ago ( TIME , April 4 , 1927 ) ; and there was every prospect that on Oct. i , 1928 the salute of U. S. gunboats will be returned with alacrity by the so-called " Chinese navy . "
