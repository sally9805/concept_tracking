" You stupid War-baby ! " shout many elder British school children when they wish to taunt younger playmates , born during the War . This insult , which now widely supplants the onetime , " Crybaby ! Cry-baby ! " became last week the subject of learned discourse , in London , by George Verity , Chairman of Charing Cross Hospital . <P> Said he : " Many mothers complain that their children come sobbing home from school , after being called ' War-Baby , ' a term supposed to denote that children born during the World War are subnormal or stupid . . . . No statement could be further from the truth . . . . Children born during periods of mental stress have , if anything , a shade more chance of being mentally alert . . . . "
