Slavery split the Methodist Church . The regeneration of religious power in the United States today may unite it . <P> Back in 1843 , two Georgia clergymen married wives who owned slaves . They were promptly accused by the Methodist Conference of New York State of contravening the doctrines of their church , and were found guilty by the Baltimore Conference that same year . Thereupon all the Conferences of the Methodist Churches in the southern states seceded and formed " The Methodist Episcopal Church , South , " which has endured until now . They held that slavery was a civil and not a religious issue . During the Civil War , Lincoln said of the Methodist Church in the North that it " sent more soldiers into the field , more nurses to the hospitals , and more prayers to heaven than any . " <P> Many attempts at reunion since the Civil War have failed . But the Con- ference of the Methodist Episcopal Church held in Des Moines , in 1920 , appointed a committee on reunion , and asked the Southern Methodists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a plan which will abolish the word " south " from " Methodist Episcopal Church , South , " incorporate the two branches of the church into one legal body , appoint one General Conference , and two Jurisdictional Conferences , one north and one south . The General Conference is to be supreme . <P> Religious journals of both sections feel confident that the plan of union will be passed by the northern branch in 1924 and by the southern branch , through its house of bishops , in the same year .
