txt A Big Business One of the very great industries of the United States is that of dairying , and its two billion dollar output entitles it to be classed as " big business . " A new chief of the Dairy Bureau of the Department of Agriculture in moving to expand this industry still further stresses three important factors as follows : ( 1 ) tireater efficiency in production : ( 2 ) Production of the highest quality in dairy products ; ( 3 ) Increasing the consumption of diary products . Scientific facts available today in regard to these factors , he says , are sufficient proof that a program of this kind entered into by the entire dairy industry will stabilize and insure prosperity for those engaged in it . He might have added also , that the same procedure in every branch of agriculture would add greatly to the prosperity of those engaged in it . However , he was talking to those engaged in a specialized branch of agriculture and kept close to his subject . We are but on the outer fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting their minds to developing the potentialities of electricity , aviation , radio and other inventions and the trade falls in line with them . But with equal possibilities in the dairy industry those engaged in it are regretably slow in making use of the facts scientific minds are offering them . Over and over again the value of pure-bred stock has been demonstrated . Yet , of the four leading breeds there are only about 200,000 registered animals , according to statistics of the Department of Agriculture . Some encouragement is found in the fact that in 1900 there were only 28,000 and in that period the number of registered Guernseys has increased 30 times . If a machine of a certain type will give an output equal to that of four or five of another kind , there is no doubt as to which machine a manufacturer will install . Cows are machines to convert feedstuffs into milk and butter fat . Only the efficient machines can justify their use . There is much to be said also about creating a better demand for the products of the dairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheese , is there not something for industry to develop ? In the 1926 report of the Secretary of Agriculture it was stated that the skim milk , butter milk and whey produced in a year amounts to 28,000,000,000 pounds . These are byproducts of butter and cheese making . The packing companies could not pay dividends today but for the byproducts which once were wasted . These byproducts of the dairy are largely fed to animals on the farm . but they have a food value six times greater than the meat and poultry produced by their use . This is something that could be developed There is also a possibility of a manufacturing use . In fact , some of the umbrella handles , paper weights and other such articles in use now are made from one of these byproducts . What science and industry have done in the packing business , the petroleum refining and other Industries , it can also do in the dairy industry and make it of still greater value .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
