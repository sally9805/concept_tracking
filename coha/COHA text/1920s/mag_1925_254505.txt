Miss Glenna Collett , famed Providence golfer , thought of a putt . On a certain 19th green , with the smell of a Southern twilight enchanting her frequently photographed nostrils , Miss Collett had seen that putt obtain its velocity from the pendulum swing of Miss Frances Hadfield , travel in an unwavering line for 20 league-long feet , disappear , with a leisured imperiousness , into the hole , thus winning for Miss Hadfield a leg on the Belleair Heights golf championship ( TIME , Mar. 16 ) . As if the smell of that twilight , still lingering in the air , enraged her , Miss Collett , last week , swished around the St. Augustine course in 79 , established a course record , won the woman 's championship of the Florida East Coast , defeated " 3 and 2 " her titian-haired opponent , Putter Hadfield.
