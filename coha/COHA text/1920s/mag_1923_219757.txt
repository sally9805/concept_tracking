Brigadier General William A. Mitchell has organized an air route between New York and Peking with three intermediate stops : Winnipeg , Nome and near the Amur River in Siberia . The General predicts that a passenger will be able to start from New York at three o'clock in the afternoon and land in Peking at ten o'clock in the morning of the third day . The General backs up his somewhat bold prediction by describing a number of safety devices .
