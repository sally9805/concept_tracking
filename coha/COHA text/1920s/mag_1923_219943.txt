While the " regular " Republicans were preparing a list of issues for the next campaign , Senator Borah , the leader of his own one-man bloc in the Senate , had something to say about the next election . Into a speech at Akron , Ohio , he ventured to inject two sentences-by a little rhetorical device dating back to the Roman Re- public-two sentences that caused no little stir in political circles . " I do not turn aside to discuss , " said he with studied innocence , " third party movements . Such a movement is not impossible , not even improbable . " This declaration he made in a speech which was in reality an excoriation of the Republican Party for not having any real issues , for " a want of faith apparently in the willingness of the electorate to follow a bold and determined program . " He said , in part : " If I were to suggest the underlying fundamental vice of American politics at this time , I would unhesitatingly declare that it consists in playing the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intelligence and patriotism of the voter . . . . Let us give to the country a thorough and fearless program . ... A Democrat in the days of Jackson was a crusader . A Republican in the days of Lincoln was an apostle . "
