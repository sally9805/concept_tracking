<P> Except for the brief statement which accompanied President Harding 's proposal to the Senate that the United States join the World Court , the first expression of the Administration 's attitude in that matter came from Secretary Hoover . Last week before the National League of Women Voters , at Des Moines , he delivered an address in explanation of the Administration 's proposal . It was devoted chiefly to explanation of the court , and refutation of the arguments of the Court 's opponents . Secretary Hoover set out to refute three classes of opponents of the Court : 1 ) Those who believe that the Court will lead us in to some " undescribed political entanglement . " This objection , Mr. Hoover points out , is raised on ignorance , because there is absolutely no compulsory provision in the President 's proposal . " We do not need to submit any case to the Court , unless we feel like doing so . ... No other nation can summon us into court . . . . The Court itself can not summon us in-nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even moral . " It is worth while noting that no politician of any prominence is making this first objection . 2 ) Those who object to the Court because it is connected with the League of Nations . This group may be considered to include such irreconcilables as Senators Johnson and Moses . These two are now abroad ; so little has been heard from them . Said Mr. Hoover : " We are not by this act joining the Court entering the League in any sense . The connection between the Court and the League is indeed remote . Its sole relationship is that the judges are elected as provided in its own statute , not by the League , but by the representatives of the nations to the League acting as an elective body for this purpose . " 3 ) Those who condemn the Court because it does not go far enough . These include Senator Borah , who wants a world court " with teeth in it , " and those who believe we should join the League as well as the Court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " are the ones who would have complained on the Wednesday night of Genesis , and would have gone to bed with a grouch because the Creator had not yet made a finished job of the sun and the moon , and would have called a mass meeting on Thursday morning to demand more forward action . " <P> The World Court has , according to Secretary Hoover , advantages over the Hague Tribunal because the latter is only an arbitrating body , and the former is a real court , capable of building up a body of international law , and giving real decisions based on law and justice rather than on compromise .
