FICTION <P> GIRL OR BOY - John North - Small , Maynard ( $2 ) . <P> " Consult Mr. Marcus Faithful . " Then , as an immaculately tailored magnifico , he accords exceedingly confidential interviews to hundreds of expectant London ladies , relieving them of maternal anxieties and fat fees . A fallen gentleman , Mr. Still , is his able secretary . A charming , competent demimondaine blackmails her way into the business , putting it on a wholesale basis through the post . After a certain number of months , of course , the jig seems up , and Mr. Marcus Faithful becomes small Mr. Crump again , dismayed when his hitherto barren wife bears twins as the result of secret correspondence with Mr. Faithful . The rich travesty on modern advertising is rounded off by an amazing rise in the male birth rate and universal posthumous acclaim for Marcus Faithful , whose only private explanation is : " It must have been faith .
