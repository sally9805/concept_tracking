txt The Chicago Tribune received today by mail what may have been the last interview given to ' a correspondent by Enrico Caruso . The interview took place at Sorrento on July 19 . " I shall sing when I wish , where I wish and what I wish , " declared Caruso to the newspaper 's representative , who called on him at the Hotel ' Vittoria . " No one is forcing Fie to sing at - any specified time , and the moment when I shall sing again just depends upon when I think , I have recovered sufficient strength after my illness . I am gaining strength and weight every day . Two weeks ago I was flabby . Now my muscles are firm . Those who say that I have sung my last on the operatic stage are wrong , for my voice is unimpaired .

His good nature was the same , however , and his determination to recover his strength bespoke a great deal . It was the bathing hour , and the aristocratic population of Italy 's most beautiful sea , : de resort was making its way to the water 's edge .

Reaching the beach , Caruso was greeted on every side by cries of " Tanti auguri , Signor Commendatore " ? ( many good wishes , Signor Commander ) ? from his title of Commander of the Crown of Italy , an honor conferred by the Ring . For it was St. Henry 's Day , and tho forty-eighth one that Enrico  --  or Henry ? Caruso had passed .

" Every morning I have my sun bath , " said he , " and every afternoon my massage . In a. week or so I shall begin ' setting up ' exercises , but am not quite up to it at present .

" Caruso was emphatic In his denial that his voice was lost , and was particularly assertive with regard to an alleged interview , which it was reported he had given to a certain Dr. Fulton , in which he was quoted as declaring that he would never sing again . . " Of course , these gashes you see on my left side are pretty deep , and the severed muscles are just knitting . Naturally , my diaphragm is weak , and at present it will hardly support the sustaining of a strong vocal note without intense pain . But I am gaining strength every day .

It 's very agreeable to be dead , but it 's a great deal nicer to be alive . " By this time the rowboat had reached the pier again , and all went ashore .

Just as he was about to leave the beach he espied the nurse girl with his little daughter , Gloria , I years old .

" We shall stay in Sorrento about another month , " said he , " and then go and see our cows , pigs , ducks and hens at our farm in the outskirts of Florence . " When shall we go hack to America ? I do n't know . That , too , shall be when I wish , for our plans are not made , and we shall merely follow our own convenience . We shall probably sail from Franca : .
