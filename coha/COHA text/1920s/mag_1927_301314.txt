ALMA-Margaret Fuller-Morrow ( $2 ) . Here is a character less rare in life than in literature , an oversexed angel set down among men to minister to their wants as a slavey but never to be wanted for herself . Tall , strong , beautifully made , fine-skinned , middleaged , immaculate , actual Almas are " Cook " or " Nurse " in thousands of U. S. households . They go to the Scandinavian Church religiously . Their eyes grow moist easily over members of " the family . " <P> Alma 's need to love is expansive enough to embrace the whole " Free Country " ( U. S.
