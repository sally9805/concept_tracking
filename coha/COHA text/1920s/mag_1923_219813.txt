Emile Bure , editor of L'Eelair , Paris journal , in a pro-Entente article suggests the formation of a " sur-Parlement , " or over-Parliament , in which French and British members would deal with questions affecting both countries . In default of a Franco-British Parliament , M. Bure suggests frequent meetings between British M. P. 's and French Deputies with the object , not only of strengthening the Entente , but of assimilating the foreign policy of each country toward the other . It is understood that such meeting will be arranged for by the French and British Governments . <P> Since the Ruhr invasion took place there have been many voices raised against the British and their policy of " good-humored inactivity . " In some cases complete separation of the two countries was advocated . There have , however , always been Entente friends to remind the more recalcitrant spirits that the preservation of Franco-British friendship is a stern necessity .
