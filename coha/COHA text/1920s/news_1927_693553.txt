txt Objection to the suggestion that the no-longer-young-worker must keep herself at Physical par in order to compete successfully with younger workers reaches me from " Mad . " " Will the older worker have to commit suicide , since ability and honesty are no longer considered by employers looking for help ? " asks Mad , who recklessly added that she knows from experience that only flapper types are favored and if they refuse to yield to employers ' improper suggestions they are quickly discharged . When the relations of employers and employf-s are presented in that light I begin to wonder what 's wrong with my picture that I can not boast one good insult .

So when the workers getting on in years are urged to keep themselves solvent physically the idea is not to offset the sentimental effects of the fresh young flapper on the boss , but to be able to produce work as enthuslas ? tically and maintain speed in production . Sentiment in business is just plain BUNK .

However , beauty is no handicap . But any woman can use her brains to keep herself looking smart and physically tit . And that is all the beauty she 'll need to please that anything but amorous gentleman in the front office . * BEAUTY ANSWERS j BY ANTOINETTE DONNELLY .
