0 NCE upon a time disease was believed to be due to the anger of gods , ill-will of enemies , influence of ancestors , devils inside you , or serpents . No one understood anything about natural causes of disease ; they had not been discovered . Hippocrates looked at man and said : " Disease is a product of natural be discovered and remedies can be applied . " Today we not only have a vast amount of information about disease , but also control it as a matter of ordinary daily living . We have been in precisely the same situation with respect to conduct . Acts of men , like disease , have been assigned to many causes  --  magic performed by enemies , divine wrath , influence of ancestors , movements of the stars , natural forces like wind and thunder . Even some kind of prenatal , original sin has been held responsible for men 's conduct . Now we know that all such ideas are aimless and stupid . We know that men 's conduct , like their bodily troubles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conduct has not only gone far , but that it will go farther . We know that psychology not only explains ordinary people to a degree little dreamed of once , but that it is able to diagnose the difficulties of abnormal people even more accurately . Their troubles can be explained , their conduct made clear , and in many instances effective treatment can be applied . Such are some of the achievements of the present-day scientific interest in conduct . Crime is only one form of disastrous or undesirable conduct . It gets more attention than other forms , but its causes are often very similar to the causes of conduct that is not declared by the law to be criminal . The important point , however , is that crime is conduct and that as such it falls within the scope of a scientific approach to conduct . If there is any hope of ridding the world of crime , it lies in the knowledge , technique , and program of a scientific understanding of such matters . All this is preliminary to a proper understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These two states , as unlike as they could well be , have astonished the world within recent weeks by announcing that they have no use for the way in which criminals have been handled in the past , that crime flourishes , that nothing effective is done to prevent crime  --  and that they intend to see what hope lies in a scientific approach . This is especially interesting to people in the United States because all of the ideas underlying these reforms are current in the United States , where the " new criminology " has been well developed on its theoretical side but where very little has been done to give it a practical trial . While we beat our hands over the enormous amount of crime among us , we cry lustily for the more vigorous use of measures known to every student of crime to be , possibly , the most dismal example of failure so far attributable to the human race . Prussia is regarded as an established , settled state , with ideas of centralization in government strong in the people 's minds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a new , loose , lax community , with little governmental experience of the kind familiar in many countries , and with unsettled ways and very little development in many arts and sciences . To find these two countries joining hands in a measure that at once places them in the leadership , for the time being , of matters criminological and turns upon them the eyes of progressive students the world over is both striking and interesting . The Prussian revolution in penal , or more accurately , in correctional , matters is the consequence of an administrative order . For some years Germany has proposed a reform in its penal law , but this has not yet been accomplished , though a measure is now pending in the Reichstag . Meanwhile , without waiting for the passage of this measure , the Minister of Justice of Prussia , named Schmidt , has ordered extraordinary changes in the whole correctional regime  --  and these went into effect October 1 . The purpose of them is to supplant punishment and incarceration , as such , with the treatment of individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sentenced by the judge . That in itself is revolutionary , for judges are nearly everywhere the sentencers of criminals , although in this country the proposal has seriously been made that judges have no business to sentence criminals , for judges know very little about the real nature of criminals or what will do them good . As most people remember , Alfred E. Smith astonished the judicial world in January , 1928 , by urging , even if it took a constitutional amendment , that penalties for crime be named and planned by a board of specialists instead of by judges . This , apparently , is precisely what Prussia has put into effect . After conviction , the offender is turned over to a " sentencing board " which , after considering his whole history and personality , gives the sentence . This is obviously a sensible procedure , for only after diagnosis can there be any intelligent treatment . Prussia has not adopted one item in the chapter of changes urged by many students of crime , namely , , the sentencing of a man for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of this is that you can not send a man to a hospital for a fixed term , for you do not know when he will be well ; so you can not send a man to prison for a fixed term , for you do not know when he will be fit to rejoin society . Nevertheless , Prussia has retained the fixed term , or at least the maximum and minimum . Now comes the man 's life in the institution to which he is sent  --  and here enter some of the most promising reforms in the penal system . To begin with , he is not to be treated as one of a mass ; the idea of throwing all prisoners together , forgetting them , . treating them as if they were just alike , paying no attention to individual differences  --  and letting them come out , when their terms expire , with nothing done to alter their mental habits or change their relation to the world around them  --  is resolutely pushed to one side as the practice of a dark age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined , understood ( if possible ) , and treated . And this is done , not merely in the interest of the prisoner , but also in the interest of society . The sentimentalists cling to traditional methods ; the realists recognize that these methods have failed , and that new methods not only are at hand but must be given a trial . And Prussia has adopted a realistic approach to the treatment of criminal personalities . A man goes to one institution or another according to the kind of person he is . If he is a long-term offender , he goes to one , if a short-term offender to another ; if this is his first crime , he is not grouped with habitual criminals ; if he is under twenty-five , he is considered young and is not thrown , to rub elbows willy-nilly , with those who have many more years behind them . Special treatment is reserved for those displaying one form or another of mental difficulty or abnormality=and this is a very large percentage of convicted offenders everywhere . Prussia , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the actual personality needs of the inmates , rather than a prison in Berlin precisely like the prison in Breslau , or a prison in Essen precisely like the prison in Dortmund . That is the usual system . Prussia , on the other hand , proposes to diversify her penal institutions just as she would diversify her schools and hospitals . She looks at her prisoners and says : " They are not all alike . Why should they all have the same treatment and spend their days going through exactly the same treadmill ? No , we will give them different treatment ? and perhaps we shall get different results . " The development of such a system of diversified institutions takes time , and Prussia has not established one merely by adopting a new correctional code . For the time being , she is apparently limited to three groups : short-term offenders , longer-term offenders who are not such bad cases , and prisoners who give every evidence of being extremely difficult to reclaim or reform . At Brandenburg , near Berlin , is rising a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying out this classification . More important than anything else in all this , of course , is the treatment given the prisoner while he is confined . Here enters the scientific understanding of conduct and personality . Prussian prisoners , many of them , are to be continuously under the eye and care of psychiatrists , with a view to removing those causes of maladjustment that have distorted their lives or led them into the mazes of crime . The technique for such study has now been well developed in this country as well as elsewhere . It consists primarily in reconstructing the early development of the offender and obtaining an intimate comprehension of those elements in his mental and emotional adjustment that produce his conduct . We can not stop here to review the technique in detail . Prison psychiatrists will be more interested in the man 's beginnings in crime , and the mental and environmental situation that confronted him then , than in details about the particular act that brought him to his present term , whether court attendants regarded him as " brazen " or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge . Not all prisoners will receive such treatment  --  there are 50,000 inmates in 800 prisons in Prussia  --  but many will , and the success will be closely related to the ability of the psychiatrists employed and the opportunities given them for effective work with individuals . Dramatic and fundamental changes are planned in daily life . When some prisoners have served half their terms , they will find themselves promoted to conditions little dreamed of in prison systems elseWhere . Instead of bleak , bare rigor they will have comfort and a certain degree of freedom . Not only will they occupy rooms with curtains at the windows and no bars , but they will eat with silverware instead of tinware , will be allowed to have their own clothing , will remain alone with visitors coming to see them , will write letters inspected by the eye of no censor  --  and in other respects will lead more of a training-school life than a prison life . The purpose of all this is to cushion the exit to the unfriendly and forbidding world , and to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken place . More important still , perhaps , is the opportunity which will be given them to leave the prison daily , lunch basket in hand , to work as free men in neighboring factories and shops , under contracts already arranged by the prison authorities . Thus , they can slowly become accustomed to resuming a normal place in society , can demonstrate their fitness for final release , and can earn money with which to start life not only honestly but effectively . Such are some of the elements in the new program by which Prussia hopes to reclaim offenders . When the new Mexican code goes into effect January 1 it will apply only to federal prisoners . That is , it will apply only to persons convicted in the federal district , including Mexico City , and those falling under federal jurisdiction in the states . There are twenty-eight states , each enjoying a large measure of autonomy , and they do not have to adopt the federal code if they do not want to . It is expected that some of them will wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , the code is solely federal , and will control the treatment of some 18,000 prisoners . a year . In theory , the code is more far-reaching than the Prussian reforms . It , too , deprives the judge of sentencing power , and places this in the hands of the Supreme Council of Social Protection and Prevention , - a new body of five members , who are to be psychologists , sociologists , and criminologists . Mexico goes beyond Prussia , however , in making the sentence absolutely indefinite , that is , without any limit of any kind , so that each criminal may be kept until those in charge of him are sure that he is fit to rejoin society  --  a bold step . In the hands of the council is placed responsibility for the treatment of prisoners , and this means that all jails , prisons , and reformatories come under its jurisdiction . The purpose of treatment is declared to be redemption rather than punishment , and to that end all the resources of psychology and other sciences are to be brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the code : social history of the offender , such as a thoroughgoing case worker in a family welfare society would develop ; medical examination and history ; psychological and psychiatric study ; and a statement of his educational attainments and progress . On the basis of these , diagnosis and treatment are to be made . It is not necessary to review the code in detail to see that it follows very much the lines already indicated  --  lines purporting to produce a scientific study of the offender and his treatment by the sciences dealing with conduct and personality . One wonders whether Mexico has the resources and personnel for this . Where did she get them ? " It has been learned , " writes Salvador Mendoza , a member of the commission drafting the new code , " that specialists exist thoroughly qualified to carry on the work of social , psychological , medical , and educational investigation embodied in the new code . " That would be a boast coming from any other country . Again , Senor Mendoza declares that " anthropological , psychological , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and describe what may be called the ' topography ' of the human personality in all its aspects " ( italics mine ) . It is to be doubted whether the proponents of these sciences , not only in Mexico , but in Prussia and the United States , would make so large a claim . One wonders whether Mexico has as many psychiatrists as she claims , and whether the treatment of personality disorders and conduct defects has reached a sufficiently high stage of development in that country to make her new program with respect to criminals feasible and safe . It would be too bad if she had been carried away by enthusiasm . It would be too bad if failure to live up to expectations should produce later a reaction in other countries against the scientific approach to crime . Nevertheless , both Prussia and Mexico have shown courage . Each has said : " Conduct has natural causes , and the acts of men can be studied  --  in many instances , understood . Crime is merely the legal classification of certain types of acts . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern science  --  and we propose to do this in the interest , not merely of criminals , but of society . "
