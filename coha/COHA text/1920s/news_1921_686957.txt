txt Questions and comments of the Sillois commerce commissioners yesterday . gave the impression that they deg ; re to ascertain whether Chicago street car fares can be reduced and the full extent to which a reduction woo bG justified , and to get these results as soon as legally practicable and With as few slurs , insinuations , and charges by attorneys as possible . They also indicated , probably because of their newness on the job , they are uncertain regarding the path to be foliaged , but Made it plain they will choose a course and set sail . The city administration , in its petition filed , picked a road for the commission , but Harry P. Weber , for the companies , made an all day argument that It is legally impossible for the commission to reduce fares by the method ho alleged the city recommended . Chester E. Cleveland and his assistant , Daniel A. Roberts , will reply for the city today . Admits Commission Can Fix Fare . Mr. Weber not only denied that he qUestioned the jurisdiction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power . On the other land , he tepeatedly and emphatically denied that the commission has the power to reduce fares by the method r-ged by the city . Of course it is immaterial to the car adore and strap hangers how it is done , but all yesterday was consumed by Weber in giving dozens of principal and subsidiary reasons to show that ? the commission Is legally powerless to combly with the city 's petition , In the meantime , as Chairman Prank L. Smith suggested when he asserted the lawyers were wasting time , " the S cent fare continues . " Roughly , Weber contended that the city 's petition asks for a restoration of the Scent fare as a contract obligation of the city . He said that the commission would violate its oath of office , statutory law , and court decisions if it restored the " contract 5 cent fare . " He asserted that the fare in the ordinance was subject to the state police power to regulate fares , and therefore did not exist as a contract binding upon the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal contention was that Mr. Cleveland asked that the order of Nov. 4 , 1920 , which established the 8 cent fare , be " rescinded , altered , amended , " and that the commission was without authority to change that order , citing various court decisions from the Atlantic to the Pacific . Weber insisted that a new petition must be filed or the commission must start an inquiry on its own motion , as . it did Tuesday with reference to gas , phone , and elevated car rates . He admitted that the commission has the power , In view of alleged changed conditions , lower prices , and economies in operation , to start an inquiry . The purposes of the lawyers did not come to the surface In the official hearing . It was rumored , however , that the city 's desire to amend the old order was founded upon its belief that it is questionable whether a convincing sho7ing for a 5 cent fare could be made on a new petition which the corn parties would not be successful in at tacking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's purpose in urging ' a new and original hearing is that it has a plan by which it has o good chance of maintaining an 8 cent fare for a year or two by means 01 court actions . Board Seeks Legal Advice . r If there is a fare reduction , certair commissioners want one that will stick sae that will mean an actual cast FaYfug to the car riders . Accordingly they conferred with their legal adviser : last night to find the course which promises sure results with the leas ' delay . Whether that will be by tilt itY 's petition , an amended petition , by the commission 's own motion , or by a new petition for an original hearing will await what Mr. Cleveland has to say today . Just before adjournment last night Cleveland said ho will show that the companies are robbing the people , that the commission has the power to restore the " contract 5 cent fare , " and that a 5 cent fare is justified by new conditions , lower prices , and economies in operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero as a wolf in sheep 's clothing , " said Cleveland . " They have made over $8,000,000 in seven months . That sum is net profits , which forecasts $14,000,000 for the year . That is $1,600,000 more than the companies have ever made in their best year . " At one point Weber said : " I feel assured that the commission will not settle the question because of the campaign promises of either Mayor Thompson or Gov . Small , nor because of the agitation in the newspapers . The public utility has no friends . "
