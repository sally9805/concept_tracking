ONE PHENOMENON is disturbing . It is curious that a people reputed to be so alive , adventurous , and imaginative as Americans seldom ride on the front platforms of their subway trains . We do it whenever possible , usually in the company only of some small boy , and recommend it highly , although the rest of the car usually sits lumpishly and smiles in a superior fashion . We wonder why . In our opinion the spectacle is amazing ; the sensation betters anything Coney Island can offer . THE PRESBYTERIAN church at Twelfth Street and Fifth Avenue is undergoing repairs , and at 4:30 in the afternoon , which appears to be knocking-off time for steeplejacks , we chanced to go by . In the churchyard stood a gentleman in his B.V.D. 's drawing on his trousers preparatory to going home for the day . ? Ve mention this because , as it happens , until then we had never seen anybody an Fifth Avenue in his underclothes . A NOTHER mystery is fortunate- . / ly still unsolved . Why will motorists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aquebogue , Cutchogue , and such refuse to pay a dollar for the privilege of riding on the magnificent Motor Parkway down Long Island ? Do they like the smells and jams of the other roads ? At times the stupidity of the public is a godsend , for , should the American People ever wake up , it might spoil the only road in the environs of the city that is still tolerable an Sunday . " AMOUNT of time spent by artists engaged by optical com-panies to paint pictures designed to show men and women looking handsome in eyeglasses is staggering . The eyeglass marts arc full of these odd portraits , yet we think the time spent by the artists in this occupation is largely wasted . We are convinced that the eyeglass companies fail in their choice of subjects , and that the people portrayed would not look handsome even if they were not wearing glasses . IT IS discouraging to hear from the wild woods that the Adirondack forests are alive with hydroplanes and airships . There is only one thing more disturbing to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the sight of a Helen Wills visor in the bow of each approaching canoe . WHAT OF the fate that hangs over the charming race of office boys ? Lazy , languid , dawdling , torpid , time-wasting to the limit , they can be seen on almost any street shuffling on their everlasting errands . The ear is ravished by their useless waggenies and the soul is cheered by their sublime indifference to the hurried spirit of the age . The scythe of the Great Reaper sweeps on inexorably , however . We weep to think that Time will make these children of idleness into efficient business men and Shriners . Cat 's Tale TITH the coming of September V V a laugh floated down from the remote Tyringham Valley in Massachusetts where have resided  --  of summers  --  two elderly spinster sisters whose principal interest centers in their cat . Last fall these estimable ladies sought a doctor friend , head of an important sanitarium there , to explain that they were leaving for New York and were taking their cat with them , but that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for four hours in a small basket . It was too cruel .

" ? ? could not give us something to put him to sleep on the trip . " The doctor obligingly guessed that lie could and administered a small dose of morphine just before the train starred . Then he forgot all about it . During the following winter , however , a neighbor sought the doctor with a stray cat she had found and the earnest request that the doctor put it out of its misery . The doctor administered morphine to this cat too , but to his surprise the cat had no sooner felt the morphine in its veins than it began shrieking and spitting at the doctor . It climbed up a window curtain and tore it , jumped upon the mantel , knocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the next two hours scooting through the village . Mystified and perturbed , the physiclan discussed the phenomenon with his associates , but there was no explanation until spring , when a junior assistant chanced to be reading up on drugs . He came to a passage which caused his eyes to bulge . Although the effect of morphine is thus and so , the medical book said , " when administered to members of the feline family it oddly has exactly the opposite effect . " " Ye gods , " said the doctor . " And I gave it to Teddy . " When the two elderly ladies returned to ' Tyringham Valley this summer the doctor evaded them , but last week they finally cornered him , quaking , in the post office . " Oh , doctor ! " they exclaimed . " We 've been looking for you all summer . We ca n't thank you enough for giving Teddy that dose last year .

" Late Editions PARTIAL figures in our investigaA tion concerning what events sell newspapers to New Yorkers , are made available by a journalist . The death of Rudolph Valentino brought a jump in the circulation of one evening paper of 50,000 copies in one day ; while that of President Harding brought only about 25,000 to the same paper . Until Valentino 's death , the greatest stories , as registered by circulation , were the Browning-Cinderella-Mary Louise Spas matter and the Rhinelander trial . So far as sales go , the latter was probably the most successful newspaper story of the generation . All papers gained from 15,000 to 50,000 readers during the trial , who stayed with them throughout the court proceedings  --  and then disappeared . We are without the circulation statistics of tabloids . Pre-Seasonal ACCORDING to those who buy and sell such things , this is the time to purchase pink coats , high hats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October will come the first meets of the comparatively few packs of hounds which cavort and yodel through the rural fringes of the city . The crops will be in , and the fields will be open . Right now is the season of preparation which enthusiasts and experts say is the best part of the year . In October you will be getting up as late as seven and riding to meet by eight o'clock ; now you can have the privilege of getting on your horse at six and seeing the sunrise from the saddle . A great many things must be accomplished before the formal season opens . Paramount is the training of the young hounds which are to make their debut with the pack . This is done in the early morning when the dew is still on the ground and scent still holds well ; it is done with each young hound coupled by a little chain to a patient old-timer . A pack runs in fan-shape , so that when a fox turns , the hounds on the outside of the formation can pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a hound gets the scent of course it gives tongue  --  or barks , as the laity would say  --  and the others run to it . A hound that yells from pure good spirits and excitement is a false alarmer and trouble-maker . It is these good spirits the young hounds must learn to down ; they must learn to bay only when they smell . And to go hunting , coupled with your mother or your aunt , is sobering . For long years auntie has been reproved for yelping at rabbits , has learned her lesson and is prepared to pass it on to the rising generation . During the preliminary period the huntsmen feel out their game  --  find out which districts will make for good sport later on . Now is the time for trying green horses , for breaking in a new pair of boots , and for seeing sunrises . For no one hunts , however much he may love horses , who does not love the country and who can not , if necessary , stand the rain running down the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in , the sport takes on the social airs which mar it in so many people 's eyes . But for the moment it is quite unspoiled . Love Scene A TELEPHONE near an open window on the inner court of the Algonquin Hotel and a poor connection on a long distance call have recently provided Broadway with a comedy-drama . The principal in the case was , fitting-ly enough , a well known actor . As he warmed to his subject , trying to make himself heard by his distant love , win-dows were raised on the court , heads filled every window , cheers punctuated his sentences , and prolonged handclap-ping followed the conclusion of the remarkable monologue . For the ensuing half hour his telephone buzzed incessantly with congratulatory messages and this unfortunate victim of circumstance was finally made the reluctant guest of honor at an impromptu party , during the merry and convivial course of which he was unanimously voted the theatre 's greatest long-distance lover . Been Invited ? RETURNED from a recent fortuitous and ghoulish journey , a friend tells of the newly opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burial ground for geniuses , is to be established . One is buried , it appears , by invitation issued either before or after death . In the latter case , of course , it is the relatives to whom the invitation is issued by the organization in charge , which is known as the League for Fostering Genius . Dr. Francis Snow is president and it numbers on its council such celebrities as Colonel S. S. McClure , Dr. Frank Crane , George Grey Barnard , Ellis Parker Butler , Henry Hull , and Mrs. Luther Burbank . A committee composed of representatives of the arts and major industries is to manage the burial plot , deciding on who is and who is not a genius . The following burial invitations have already been issued : Edwin Markham , S. S. McClure , Celeonor Dugas , portrait painter ; Thomas Edison , Olga Petrova , Daniel Frohman , David Belasco , Elsie Janis , Henry Hull , Caroline Bird , ten-year-old poetess ; Mrs. Winifred Sackville Stoner , inveterate foe of Mother Goose , Santa Claus , and zoos ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Rexford , incidentally , is opposed to the wearing of black , nor does she approve of the monotony of pure white ; so her tombstone and bust , THE NEW YORKER already designed by herself , are to be of colored marble . Each genius is required to have a bust and , in order that the plot may bear none of the gloom of the ordinary burying ground , it is stipulated that each bust must smile , Alexandre Zeitlin , sculptor , has already completed the central figure , that of a woman sitting on top of the world and , with a smile , demanding peace . Valentino was considered eligible by the League , but his manager , we are told , declined the invitation sent . Also Chauncey Depew , the story goes , will shortly receive a bid . The most unfortunate invitation issued by the League for Fostering Genius was inadvertently sent to the Putnam family last week . The latter were invited to " remove the body " of Major George Haven Putnam to the Campo Santo . Major Putnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARE speaking in superlatives of a notable new moving picture in town . It is the already celebrated " Potemkin , " the startling , artful and faintly incendiary photo-play fashioned by the Soviet Government and sent out into the world to annoy established authority everywhere . The Film Arts Guild brought it here and exhibited it behind closed doors in a subterranean hall in Forty-second Street last week . There was a veritable stampede of the invited to see it  --  a rush inspired not so much by the far-off cheers of Professor Reinhardt , whose praise ran ahead of the picture into this country , but by the not implausible notion that our masters in the censorship way would either mutilate it or ban it altogether . " Potemkin " rehearses , in terms of a heroic saga , a small mutiny which did take place aboard one of the Little White . Father 's armored cruisers back in 1905 . You not only have the urchin pleasure of seeing the sailors pitch their cruel officers into the sea , but arc lifted out of your seat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scathless through the tightening cordon of battleships , thanks to the fact that , for once in a way , one set of Russians firmly declined to fire on another . Recklessly subjected to this infection were such already restive old salts as Christopher Morley , Maude Adams , Dwight Franklin , Neysa McMein , Sally James Earnham , Robert E. Sherwood , Norman Bel-Geddes , Fannie Hurst ( shaking with excitement ) , and many others . The betting today is rather against the vouchsafing of " Potemkin " for a wider audience than Miss Hurst . But , incorrigible in this office , is an unruly spirit who would give a good deal to watch the effect of the picture on Rear-Admiral Plunkett . It was he , you will remember , who commanded " What Price Glory " to withdraw . Hippodrome IT MEANS " horse-circus " ; and in I the beginning , one remembers a scene in which a whole troop of cavalry rushed to the huge stage and Hung itself into a take of real water , But that phase passed some time ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of existence , perhaps the last before demolition  --  a phase to suit those who like their motion pictures interlarded with vaudeville . They say it has to be vaudeville since the house seats 6,100 , and by the saying , the larger the audience It is recalled that the largest playhouse in the world opened in 1905 with " A Yankee Circus on Mars . " " A Society Circus " and a long series of spectacles followed . The keynotes were Marcelline ; elephants ; stunts of all kinds ; Charlotte , the skating queen ; Annette Kellermann , the diving Venus , and a bevy of heroic show girls who walked down steps into water and disappeared . That was the first phase , and it lasted eighteen years , ending with such things as " Hip , Hip Hooray . " ee CZ NC K 27 Then came straight vaudeville . And now come the all-conquering films and their peculiar accompanying vaudeville . As to who goes to the Hippodrome ? who does n't at some time or other ? There is room for everybody . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squealing children , wild-eyed with excitement as the elephants thundered on the stage , will be the great public that loved Valentino so much and that still believes that rich girls really end up by marrying heroes . Positive THIS year 's mosquito period has been worse than usual , the insects being reported as numerous in parts of town which have n't seen them in a decade . We know of two people who , while pursuing the pests , have broken toes . The question has again arisen , of course , as to whether the beasts are native or have migrated from New Jersey . To prove his state blameless , one Jerseyite took a metropolitan friend to the Plaza and pointed to the pool beneath the Lady with the Bath Towel . " There 's where your mosquitoes come from , " he declared . " Nonsense , " said the local defender , " if mosquitoes were breeding here do you think this lady ( pointing upwards ) would go around dressed like that ? Why , in New jersey she 'd have to wear chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party recently 1 given by Mr. H. H. Rogers in Newport , a butler repeatedly trod upon the feet of Mr. Rogers ' guests and accompanied his actions with muttering and vicious looks . Finally the servitor turned to one of the most distinguished guests , a dignified old fellow seated on the greensward , and demanded , " My God , keep your feet in ! " The distinguished guest considered it his duty to tell Mr. Rogers , and together they took the butler aside . It was a case either of intoxication or of insanity , they felt , and a policy of tact was decided upon . " You 're hired for the day , are n't you ? " inquired the host . " Well , here 's twenty dollars . Take the rest of the afternoon off . " " Ah no , " the serving man declared , " I 'm hired for the day and I 'm staying for the day . I like the party . " The problem was taken to Mrs. Rogers , who had done the engaging , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke Barnett of vaudeville , who hires himself out for the purpose of hoaxing guests . We have touched on Mr. Barnett 's activities before , but not at Newport . THERE is also the incident of the I- butler at the extra-elegant affair who was approached and asked the whereabouts of the library . " I do n't know , " he replied . " Ask that fellow over there . He 's been around here before . " Pour le Sport THE FRENCH Tennis Team , contenders for the Davis Cup , are apparently not taking their task too seriously . When in town they live at the Vanderbilt , liking New York and having a lot of fun . They say they feel quite virtuous if in bed around twelve , and have been known to go on as wild an escapade as a midnight bus ride . BOROTRA is perhaps one of the most interesting of the visitors . A native of Argonne , near Biarritz in the Basque Pyrenees , he now lives in Paris at 26 rue Cler , plays pelota and football as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company in France . He is an amateur above suspicion . With business always first in his mind , as soon as he arrives here for a match , he dashes to Cincinnati or Chicago offices instead of to the courts . Last year this French tennis player made himself famous by being absent on business at the hour of his first match with Tilden , thus keeping the American champ waiting an hour . Off to Springfield , Massachusetts , a few days ago on business , between matches , his chief annoyance was that he could obtain no aeroplane . Gayly he will announce in his halting English : " It is , I promise you , impossible to mix tennis and business . " But this does not deter him . He sat up all night in his office at Paris the day before sailing , and worked until twenty minutes before train time . Lacoste , the youngest and most reticent of the team ( nicknamed the Crocodile , which explains the " C " embroidered on his blazer ) is just turned twenty-one , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service which , we are told , in some instances is not too rigorously exacted . We remember the story of Couiteas , fifth ranking tennis player in France , who served his term in the meteorological department of the army by-driving up to the departmental steps , looking at the sky and remarking that it looked like rain  --  and then driving off to the tennis courts . Gilou , the captain , is not playing but of course is here with the team . Cochet , son of a grounds keeper at the Tennis Club in Leon , another youthful prodigy of the group , has just recently been married and has made the present American visit his honeymoon . He speaks no English at all . They are all bothered by American food and miss their wine , but when Borotra was casually introduced to a man described to him as a bootlegger , he was so perturbed that he hurriedly turned to an American friend and said : " Please do not mention this or I shall be confined in prison .
