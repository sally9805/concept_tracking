Golfing women of the U. S. consulted their professionals about form ; their tailors about costume ; their husbands or parents about travelling expenses ; their time tables about trains for Providence , R. L , where the women 's national championship will open Sept. 1 . <P> From Atlanta , came word that Alexa Stirling , champion in 1916 , 1919 , 1920 , was still too fragile after her recent appendicitis operation to enter the lists . <P> The Fairfield ( Conn . ) Country Club ranged some pre-tournament mixed foursomes , wherein National Cham pion Edith Cummings , one-time Champions Glenna Collett ( 1922 ) and Marion Rollins ( 1921 ) , and Mrs. Quentin Feitner , former Metropolitan champion ( 1920 ) , reinforced by five bisques apiece , would tackle Champion Max Marston , onetime Champions Jess Sweetser ( 1922 ) and Francis Ouimet ( 1914 ) , and French Champion John G. Anderson ( all amateurs ) . Golden golf balls were dangled as prizes for the winning team . <P> There is but a single thundercloud darkening Champion Edith 's horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in winning the Western title , a fortnight ago , would more than suffice to conquer Marion Hollins , even though the Metropolitan champion has played more keenly this year than since her 1921 championship . Alexa is sidetracked . Mrs. Vanderbeck , of Philadelphia , however steady , can not withstand Edith in a fighting mood , as was demonstrated in the semifinals of last year 's title play , when Edith battled her from dormie two to a win at the 20th . There are Mrs. Hurd and Mrs. Barlow of Philadelphia , Louise Fordyce of Ohio , and Miriam Burns of Kansas , but none of these looms really large . Barring a vagrant , unpredictable typhoon , the only disturbance charted is the dark little terror whose native haunt is Providence-Glenna . She is indeed a thundercloud , always has been , particularly for Edith . The two have met once this year - in the finals of the Buffalo invitation matches . Glenna won . <P> Than Alexa Stirling there is no finer mistress of golfing style in this country . Glenna , masculine of wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , while steady and dependable , is more loosely constructed than theirs , but she makes up the difference in temperament . Like brother Dexter , the intercollegiate champion , she is bursting with boyish energy and spirit . Her interests are not confined to golf alone . <P> . . .
