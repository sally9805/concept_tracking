txt A Titian masterpiece , the portrait of Alfonso d'Este , Duke of Ferrara , characterized by Director Edward Robinson as the most important picture that the Metropolitan Museum has ever purchased , will be placed on exhibition today at the museum in the Room of Recent Accessions . The bequest of the late Frank A. Munsey , which has been variously estimated at 520,000,000 to $25,000,000 , made possible the purchase of this portrait . " When sufficient income for the purpose shall have been received from the estate of the late Frank A. Munsey , " a footnote in the April Bulletin of the museum reads , " it is the intention of the Trustees of the museum to assign the portrait to his bequest , ' as a'Worthy first purchase from that benefaction , without which they would have hardly felt at liberty to buy this iii7portant picture . ' " In. accordance with the established policy of the museum , the purchase price was not made public . Other paintings by Titian , however , have been valued as high as $1,000,000 , notably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Sacred and Profane Love , " for which a member of the Rothschild family offered $1,000,000 twenty-five years ago . Portrait Unearthed in Paris . Until a little over a year ago , when it turned up in Paris , having been bought as an unknown work out of the chateau of the Colntesse de Vogue . near Dijon , it was believed that the painting of the militant and brilliant husband of Lucrezia Borgia had been lost early in the eighteenth century in a fire that consumed the south gallery of the royal castle at Madrid . In 1666 , according to seventeenth century inventories , this painting was taken from Bologna into Spain , and that was the last official record until it was recognized last year in Paris as the Alfonso d'Este , the picture that Titian himself had called one of his finest ; which Michelangelo " highly recommendad " and which a Duke and an Emperor bickered over as the bribe price of two populous cities and wide territories . The museum bought the picture last February from A. S. Drey. the Munich antiquary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Georg Gronau . Critics Agree on Authenticity . " This picture is without pedigree , no to speak . " Director Robinson said in announcing the acquisition . " Its history is scarcely a year old . When it turned up in Paris is was at once recognized as Titian 's , although the owner did not know it . As a matter of fact , the opinions of eight or ten of the leading critics in Europe ware obtained , and for once they all agreed . " Another fact of great interest , " continued Mr. Robinson , " is that it is not a picture of an unknown person . Alfonso , Duke of Ferrara , was extremely prominent in his time . He was born in 1486 and succeeded to the duchy in 1305 . He died in 1534 . Duke Alfonso tor political purposes and at the behest of his father , married in 1502 the beautiful widow of several husbands , Lucrezia Borgia , the daughter of Pope Alexander VI . Whatever the justness of her historic reputation , the marriage appears to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a model mother , " Mr. Robinson said . " She bore him three children and died in 1519 . " Early History of the Picture . The date of the picture has been fixed from old documents as about 1523-1525 , shortly after the artist had completed his celebrated series of paintings for the Duke 's studio in the Ferrara castle . Alfonso 's court was known as one of the most brilliant in Europe . He . Titian 's first patron of note and ha had gathered a distinguished array of artists at his court . The picture shows Alfonso standing beside a gun . The posture was chosen by the Duke because of his great love for artillery , of which he was an expert founder . In his foundry at Ferrara he cast the best guns of the day in Europe . He invented also a method for making gunpowder superior to that in vogue and supplied from his powder factory munitions for those monarchs who had sufficient sums to buy . " For all his wealth and genius , " writes Bryson Burroughs , Curator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was precarious and only to be maintained by vigilant and adroit statesmanship , by quick shifts in alliances with great powers that then made Italy their battleground . " It was in one of these quick shifts in the incessant wars involving monarchs and the Pope that the painting by Titian , already famous in Italy , played its part . Titian himself had pointed out the picture to the Emperor Charles V. and when circumstances reached a climax in 1530 in which Charles of Spain , allied with Pope Clement VII , who was then in control of all Italy , was crowned , the Duke of Ferrara had to do some fast negotiating to maintain his position in the new alignment . Pictures , it was known , were the most effective bribes to Emperor Charles , who had made himself arbiter of an old dispute over the cities of Modena and Reggio between the Duchy of Ferrara and the Papal States . Alfonso , therefore , with great reluctance and after much dickering , gave up with other pictures his best-loved painting . Titian 's portrait of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Emperor 's room at Bologna , whence it was eventually taken to Spain . Alfonso at once commissioned Titian to paint for him a replica with this difference : The new picture was to show the Duke wearing the Order of St. Michel , a distinction received from Francis I of France . This fact particularly distinguishes the original , which the museum now has , from the replica . Identification Marks on Original . " The Duke is younger in our work by ten years , " Mr. Burroughs writes . " He is in an easier and more commanding posture ; the placing of the hands and their direction make a more flowing line in the composition , and lastly  --  an imp &rtant; fact for Its identification  --  he wears a jewel hanging front a delicate gold chain about his neck and not the Order of St. Michel . " All who have seen the picture , the figure a little larger than life size , have noted the remarkable light effects about the face . " I was a little disappointed when I first saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It fairly cries for light . " As exhibited under an electric light the features stand out . As one enters the room the high , white forehead and the ruddier face beneath look out against the dark background in startling relief . " Only Titian could have painted the deep crimson velvet of the doublet , " Mr. Burroughs said , " the soft fur of the collar , the liquid blue of the sapphire and the glint of the pendant pearl on his chest . Surely our picture is one of his great achievements . "
