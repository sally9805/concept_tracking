Chiefs of the national banks of England , France and Germany debarked at Manhattan last week for their regular summer conference and discussion of world economics with their good friend , Benjamin Strong , Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . All had been in the U. S. before , but severally . All had met before , but in Europe , where heretofore Governor Strong has spent his summers visiting with them . These comrades in finance , these truly international bankers , were : <P> Charles Rist , Deputy Governor of the Banque de France ( Emile Moreau is Governor ) , a close-mouthed man , who was of the four least known to U. S. newsgatherers . Few realized that he had been professor of law in the Facult de Droit de Paris ; that he was an intimate of Premier Raymond Poincare of France ; that he was an intimate of onetime ( 1917 &; 1925 ) French Premiers Paul Painlev and ( 1924-25 &; 1926 ) Edouard Herriot , with whom in 1921 he helped organize the now moribund Ligue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and establish a policy of democratic post-War reconstruction . M. Rist has been Deputy Governor of the Banque de France for only the past year . He is one of Europe 's most profound economists . <P> Dr. Hjalmar Schacht , President of the German Reichsbank , with a mind as clear-thinking as a calculating machine , is one of the constructive geniuses of post-War Germany . Born in 1877 he was a partner in the Darmstadter-und-National bank until 1923 , worked with the Reich Currency Commission that set up the present gold mark standard in Germany , cooperated with the ( Charles Gates ) Dawes Committee on German reparations . He has been president of the Reichsbank since 1924 . He is a stern man to deal with , imperturbable and ruthless in carrying out a fiscal program . Only seven weeks ago , when German speculators were running wild , he passed put instructions that loans to Berlin stock market operators be instantly reduced by onefourth . There was panic on the Berlin Bourse ( TIME , May-23 ) . <P> Montagu Collet Norman , Governor of the Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reared in that fin-de-sicle British atmosphere that supplied Margot , Viscountess Oxford &; Asquith with long , pendent earrings , Oscar O'Flahertie Wills Wilde with a sunflower boutonnire and Winston S. Churchill with a paunch , Montagu Collet Norman affects a soft felt hat , bow necktie and a superbly pugnacious goatee . Like his contemporaneous compatriots his wit is keen , his thinking sharp , his knowledge authoritative . Born in 1871 , he has been Governor of the Bank of England since 1920.
