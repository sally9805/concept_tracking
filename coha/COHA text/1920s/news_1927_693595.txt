Through a grimy window the jurors were viewed from time to time by ' various persons in the Federal Building . They could be seen smoking , gesticulating and walking about . Once a juror was seen beating a clenched fist against an open palm .

Judge Knox convened court and gave to the jury two letters written by Colonel Goff ; as he was then called , to ' the Attorney ' General recommending approval of the $7,000 , - 000 claim made by Richard Merton , German banker , against the Alien Property Custodian .

These letters , together with an enclosure which authorized the Treasury Department to make the required disbursements and another letter authorizing the Attorney General 's office to approve alien property claims were handed to Lawrence L.

From none of the jury 's questions in court could it be determined in which direction the majority was leaning . There were unofficial reports that they had linked the two defendants in the action and had decided to convict or acquit both of them .

Mr. Buckner issued a statement yesterday that several newspapers had misquoted that part of his summing up in which he referred to his attitude toward Mr. Daugherty . He had been quoted in both afternoon and morning newspapers as having said that the jury should convict Colonel Miller in fifteen minutes , but that he did not care what they did about Mr. Daugherty . Mr. Buckner furnished copies of that part of his summing up . The records showed he had said : " Why , Miller is convicted . Whatever length of time you gentlemen take on the Daugherty case , I do not anticipate you will spend over fifteen minutes on Miller . " " When you look the whole case over , " Mr. Buckner said later in summing up , " the Daugherty case is just as crushing as the Miller case .

He had previously told the jury that a conviction would " kill Mr. Daugherty on the spot . " Colonel Miller seemed more lighthearted than usual . He smiled frequently , but his wife , who has been at his side throughout the trial , seemed worn from the strain . Many seats in the court room remained occupied throughout the day and evening by persons hoping that the jury would bring in a verdict .
