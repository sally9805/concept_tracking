Two of Signor Benito Mussolini 's ministers have constantly dared to call their souls and policies their own . One is Signor Luigi Federzoni , soft speaker for the Vatican , Colonial Minister . The other and greater is Count Giuseppe Volpi . <P> Volpi put the lira back on gold ( TIME , Jan. 2 ) . Volpi adroitly won huge concessions from the U. S. and Great Britain in funding the Italian debts to those powers ( TIME , Nov. 23 , 1925 ) . As Finance Minister , Volpi has been for three years past the one Italian statesman with whom U. S. big business has found it possible to deal-man to man , without undue formality , with absolute confidence . <P> Last week , Count Volpi resigned as Finance Minister . He is known to have incurred the ire of Il Duce on several occasions-notably when he insisted that the lira be put back on gold at a lower valuation than that at first desired by Signor Mussolini . But from this it must not be rashly assumed that Count Volpi was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other moods given his Finance Minister to understand that he must resist certain highly lucrative offers from the sphere of private business which have become especially tempting of late . <P> The fiscal collaboration of Benito Mussolini and Giuseppe Volpi is simply at fruitful end . Last week the Count was replaced as Finance Minister by Senator Antonio Mosconi , never before a cabinet minister , but a good Fascist " party man . "
