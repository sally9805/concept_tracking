Let a U. S. citizen fall sick in the Balkans or in Turkey . Let him brood upon slimy gutters , promiscuously expectorating citizens , and the greasy scum which swims upon his especially ordered soup . Let him grow sicker . But finally and mercifully transport him to a clean bed and a cheerful room in the American Hospital at Constantinople . He will then realize the special and comforting importance of that institution . He will understand , why , last week , the U. S. Ambassador to Turkey , Joseph Clark Grew , took care to conduct through the Hospital and its adjoining School for Nurses an august guest , his cousin , John Pierpont Morgan , who is now cruising in Turkish waters on his yacht Corsair ( TIME , April 16 ) . <P> Ambassador Grew has never minced words in declaring that the continued efficient functioning of the American Hospital is of vital import to the U. S. colonies in Constantinople and in cities of the Balkan and Asiatic hinterlands . Yet the hospital has faced a deficit for the past several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if financial aid is not speedily forthcoming from the U. S. Director Dr. Shepard of the Hospital and School has economized and scrimped . The nurses now in training who go out upon graduation to spread U. S. medical methods in Turkey are now cooped up in such quarters that four or five must sleep in a small room . Financier Morgan was impressed by what he saw and heard , last week , but sometimes even great philanthropists are tardy about giving aid . Therefore generous and perspicacious U. S. citizens-some of modest means-sent cheques at once , last week , to the Near East Colleges Association in Manhattan which is charged with receiving contributions for the American Hospital in Constantinople .
