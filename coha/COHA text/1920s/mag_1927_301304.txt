Manhattan newspapers , like summer-silly urchins , threw Pastor John Roach Straton of Calvary Baptist Church and his son Warren Badenock Straton , 19 , into the lake of metropolitan publicity last week . Their excuse for the " hazing " was Son Warren Badenock 's recent epileptiform " baptism by fire of the Holy Spirit " and Father John Roach 's quarrel with five of his deacons a fortnight ago ( TIME , July 4 ) . The newspapers were " following up " these " stories . " It was incumbent upon the Stratons to swim or sink . <P> Father John Roach had learned to breast publicity long ago in the lesser ponds of his early pastorates-in Chicago , Baltimore and Norfolk . He had no coach other than his own intuition and his experience . The sons of the pastor , however , have had his stout hands under their chests as they began paddling into public attention .

Last week , " followed up " by Manhattan newspapers , Warren Badenock Straton also had his father to imitate . <P> The New York Evening Post sent one Kenneth Campbell , reporter , to interview the Stratons last week . He was meticulously observant and took obvious pleasure in relating how he found Pastor Straton in bed late in the afternoon , " clad in an old-fashioned night shirt . . . . From a gas jet at the head of the bed hung Dr. Straton 's black waistcoat , from which dangled the medal he won in a college oratorical contest many years ago . <P> <P> The medal swung back and forth to the rhythm of the fundamentalist leader 's vehemence . His usually sonorous voice sounded less impressive from his bed than it sounds from Calvary pulpit .

The reporter described : " The family gathered around the bed to inspect it . At the first glance Dr. Straton sat bolt upright and Mrs. Straton who was holding the newspaper emitted sorrowful clucks . The-pastor 's noseglasses slipped from his nose and he fumbled for them among the covers , retrieved them and put them in place . His eyes narrowed with anger as he looked at the picture .

His hands were clasped unctuously , and on his face was an arch and radiant expression .
