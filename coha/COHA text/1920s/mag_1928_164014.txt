The Boston Symphony came last week to Manhattan-with Serge Koussevitzky for conductor , Contralto Margarete Matzenauer , Tenor Tudor Davies , Baritone Fraser Gange for soloists , the Harvard Glee Club for a Chorus , and Speaker Paul Leyssac . This combination gave , as it did a fortnight ago in Boston ( TIME , Mar. 5 ) , the Odipus Rex of Igor Stravinsky . Even the ablest critics sometimes disagree . Said Samuel Chotzinov ( the World ) : " . . . a desperate attempt at a musical interpretation of lofty cosmic tragedy . . . a presumptuous drive with nothing of any consequence to back it up .
