txt With the end of the Sixty-seventh Congress just one and one-half legislative days away the Senate speeded up tonight and disposed of three of the most important of the bills caught in the last minute rush of the dying Congress . The Rural Credits tangle , scores of House bills , which were catapulted into the Senate today , and many important Presidential nominations still remain to be disposed of . The party leaders are now hopeful that they will have the calendar cleared up by midnight tomorrow , and that the clock will not have to be turned back during the last minutes of the session , which under the law ends at noon Sunday . The three bills of major importance passed tonight were the Reclassification bill , which equalizes the pay of Government employes ; the Mississippi River Flood Control measure , which authorizes an expenditure of $60,000,000 in the next six years for the control of the flood areas of the Mississippi and its tributaries , and the Deficiency Appropriation bill , which carries $150 , - 700,000 . In a two-hour executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidential nominations awaiting action . The nominations confirmed included those of Senator Carter Glass , Representative ' Charles R.'Crisp and Ptictiard Olney , to vbe me berg of . the Foreign Debt ** on ; Representative Horad.er ; I4 Artoylr*Matfig9o2F-1. erho'r of Porto kiido ; Ar ; : biisding-er to be a member of the Federal Reserve Board ; Moss to be Assistant Sedretary of the Treasury ; Dwight Davis to be Assistant Secretary of War ; Frank T. Hines to be Director of the Veterans Bureau ; William Bondy to be United States Judge for the Southern District of New York . and Frank W. Mondell to . be a Director . of the War Finance Corporation . The last-minute jam , which always develops in the dying ? hours of a Congress , led Senato ; ? Norris . of Nebraska to say some pointed things in.the Senate this afternoon regarding what he termed the short session evil . If Congress is to function properly this evil , Senator Norris declared , must be eliminated and a way devised by which socalled " lame ducks " will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assails Killing of Amendment . The Nebraska Senator based his remarks on the failure of the House of Representatives to act on the Senate resolution to amend the Constitution so as to bring new Congresses into office two , instead of thirteen , mouths after the election . He assailed certain House leaders , whom he charged with responsibility for the failure of that branch of Congress to act , it being the general understanding that he had in mind Representative Mondell , the majority floor leader in the House , and Representative Campbell , Chairman of the Committee on Rules , both of whom were defeated for re-election . The time has come , declared Senator Norris , for Congress to take cognizance of the Presidential practice of caring for - lame ducks , " a system , he added , which gives the President power to control legislation in short sessions through the tender of good jobs to those who have been retired to private life by their constituents . Mr. Norris suggested that- the Qonstatition be amended so as to make impossible the appointment of " lame ducks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of Congress . " We have , at 2:15 P. M. on the second day of March , just taken up a bill of tremendous-importance ( the Reclassification bill ) , composed of eighty-three pages , a bill which has to do with practically the entire clerical service of the Government of the United States , " he said . " Thousands of Government employes are directly interested and controlled by the provisions of the bill . Now we are confronted with the remarkable i fact that , although this bill has been under consideration by the committees of the Congress for somewhere in the neighborhood of fourteen months , we are expected to pass it almost in fourteen minutes after it is taken up . " H this bill is to pass , we must pass it almost without reading , with very little debate or discussion , with practically no analysis , and then it must go to conference and the conferees must agree on a report between now and noon of Sunday . and they may come back to us with an entirely new bill , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the time to look It over It would probably run us beyond the 4th of March . At least , It would interfere with other legislation perhaps as important . " I am calling attention to something which everybody knows to be true . What kind of legislation do you expect Congress to enact when every two years we are engulfed with a situation like this ? We must do one of two things . We must pass this bill and other bills without giving them consideration , or we must , by considering one bill defeat other n-eritorious measures . A man or corporation of enterprisd and progress would not pemit such a condition to exist in private business for one moment . yet this has been the condition in Congress for years , as a matter of fact ever since the adoption of the Constitution of the United States . What have we done during the short session ? Most of the time has been taken In the consideration of one bill . which can not pass . and which is conceded now to be dead , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subsidy . We must admit-two things : first , if we had had no short session . and the new Congress had coremenced in January after it had been elected . the Ship Subsidy bill would not have been here at all , because it is conceded that the new Congress would not pass it . That is one things which must be admitted . Would End Filibusters . " Another one is that , regardless of that , even if the bill had been here , and we did not know in advance that on the 4th day of March we had to quit , that the session necessarily ended on that day , there would have been no delay even in the ship bill . Ninety per cent . of the successful filibusters which have been carried on have been in the - short session of Congress , made possible entirely by the ending of Congress on the 4th of March , an I in this case there would have been no filibuster and no Ship bill , if it had not been for the fact that Congress will close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senators have read this b:11 of 53 pages ? I confess I have not . and I have been working 10 hours a day . I. of course , do not know but in my judgment outside of the committees which handled it I do not believe there have been half a dozen members of this body who have read it , or will read it , and I say that without-criticism . I Ara not finding fault with Senators . They have too much to do , and most of it will not be done when we close on the 4th of March . What is the result ? We get half baked legislation. , We get all kinds of jokers in our laws . We are prevented from passing valuable legislation which everybody admits ought to be passed . This very condition would be relieved If the House would pass and the legislatures would approve the constitutional amendment the Senate passed some time ago . " That proposition is now hung up in the House . It is conceded that if they could get a vote on it it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one or two men have it within their power to block it all , and to prevent the passage of that resolution , and thus the adoption of that constitutional amendment which would relieve the very situation we are in now . " If the 4th of March were not just a few days off that resolution would pass the House . I have made no disrespectful remarks apout any of the socalled ' lame ducks . ' I have not argued the proposition . from that point of view , although it is one reason for the amendment . It is perfectly preposterous that a Congress , vlected in November should wait thirteen months before going to work . Yet that is the case now . " Why is the House of Representatives , which is supposed to represent the people , absolutely impotent and unable to make a move because one man says no , or two men say no ? " " Why does the Senator scold us ? He is a practical man , and the Senate has passed the resolution . " interrupted Senator Watson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guilty conscience . or he would not think I have been scolding , " replied Senator Norris . " I am talking about a man who is not a Senator . " Against Jobs for " Lame Ducks . " Subsequently Senator Norris referred to a member of the House who is slated for a $12,000 job . This man , he said , opposed the resolution on the ground that It does not give men elected to Congress time to " settle down and cool off " after they are elected , and for the additional reason that he does not think Congress should " monkey " with the Constitution . Representative Mondell of Wyoming , the Republican leader in the House , who was defeated when he ran for the Senate in November has been nominated to be a member of the War Finance Corporation at $12,000 a year . " This jam , " concluded Senator Norris . " this jam now on use , this jam of Incompetency and impotency that comes every two years , no matter how good everybody may be , how honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plague us unless we remedy that situation , and the people , almost to a man , are calling for relief , and are unable to get it because somebody will not let the people 's representatives vote . " I claim that a new Congress ought to be put into office as soon a , i possible . We have recently seen many men who have been defeated for re-election to the Senate or House appointed to high positions . I am not saying they were disqualified to hold those offices . That is not the danger . The danger comes in those conditions giving to the man in the White House almost supreme power over the . Congress . The danger is thta that kind of a system gives to the President a power the forefathers never intended he should have in the control of legislation . " We need another amendment to the Constitution . one just as important as the one pending in the House ? an amendment that in effect shall say that a member of Congress shall be disqual/fled from receiving ' a Federal appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two years thereafter . As long as the President has the power in his hands that he now has and has had , not only this President but other Presidents before him , it is a temptation too great for nny man to lay aside . Wen he has the power to control legislation and ft is necessary to deal out offices to Senators and Representatives to get that legislation enacted , he will do it . " Senator Dial asked Senator Norris if he would favor an amendment , limiting the Presidential term to six years , making the President ineligible for , a second term . Senator Norris replied that he would favor such an amendment . " I think , " he added , " it would help . " When Senator Norris concluded . Senator Borah was on his feet prepared to endorse what he said . Mr. Lodge , however , was alert , and moved an Executive session which took the Idaho Senator off his feet . Subsequently the Senate returned to open session and resurned debate on the Reclassification measure . ?  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
