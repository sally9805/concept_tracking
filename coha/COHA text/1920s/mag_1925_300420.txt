Impeded by rough weather which kept cranes in shelter miles away from the spot where the submarine S-51 was sunk off Block Island in collision with the coastwise steamer City of Rome , the would-be rescuers of any sailors alive in the sunken submarine lost hope . Two divers sent down each succeeded in entering the battery room hatch and each brought up the body of a seaman . <P> After the submarine had been at the bottom 113 hours ( 72 hours is supposed to be the safety limit for men within such a ship ) , Rear Admiral Christy announced : " Reluctantly and sorrowfully we must all concede that there is no longer a possibility of human life existing in the flf-61 . " He asked to be allowed to give up attempts at rescue and begin salvage operations . Secretary Wilbur nonetheless directed that the rescue work continue . <P> Finally , although the seas were still troublesome , the two giant cranes Monarch and Century were brought to the spot and succeeded in catching the ends of the slings which the divers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combined lifting capacity of 350 tons , they failed to budge the sunken craft . They tried a second time and failed . It was concluded that the submarine had entirely filled with water . A diver with an oxy-acetaline torch cut a tiny hole in the engine room hatch . A few air bubbles escaped . Then nothing more . The compartment was filled with water . <P> There was no hope left . <P> Secretary of the Navy Wilbur announced that a court of inquiry had been ordered to convene at the Boston Navy Yard and fix the responsibility for the loss of the S-51 . <P> The three survivors of the wreck , picked up after being swept through the conning tower hatch as the submarine sank , testified that they believed at least four others had escaped through the hatch but had drowned . <P> <P> Frederick E. Techemaker of Indianapolis , who lost twin sons on the S-51 , said : " I am proud that my sons were serving their country when they died . I think the Navy is the finest possible life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later the engine room hatch was cut open and three bodies were taken out by divers . Another diver with an electrical device burned a hole in the forward torpedo room. *That also was flooded . All hope was gone . <P> <P> *The divers worked at the depth of 127 ft. in great difficulties . They had to be careful not to entangle their own ropes , wires , and air hose in the antennae , which would have been fatal . An hour was all they could stay down at a time . Exploring in the interior of the submarine with their bulky suits , with 24-pound weights on their feet and lead-weighted belts was difficult and dangerous . About an hour and a half was spent in raising them to the surface after each descent . They were raised 15 ft. and then allowed a rest while they adjusted themselves to the pressure . Sudden lifting produces the " bends " or caisson disease . Tanks were at hand on the surface in case of emergency that might require a diver 's being raised rapidly . If so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanks under pressure , which would be gradually lowered , to save him from the harmful effect of the rapid change .
