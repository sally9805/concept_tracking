Charles MacVeagh , two weeks ago appointed U. S. Ambassador to Japan , said to reporters last week : <P> <P> " Years ago , during the Russo-Japanese War , I had a most pleasant acquaintanceship with Baron Kentaro Kaneko , now a Marquis . I was able to be of service to him , and Mrs. MacVeagh was helpful in managing a pageant for the benefit of Japanese children made fatherless through the War . <P> " I count as a precious possession my decoration of the Order of the Rising Sun , bestowed by the Emperor of Japan . I long have been fond of the Japanese people , and with a great deal of pleasure I look forward to " seeing their charming country and learning more of their customs , which appeal to me greatly .
