The Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad is the oldest trunk-line road in the U. S. Last year was the B. &; O. 's 97th birthday , and the most successful year in its long history in several respects . No previous year 's gross operating revenue was ever as high as the 1923 figure of $255,594,435 ; in 1922 it was $200,843,169 . No previous year 's net revenue has reached or surpassed 1923 's record of $22,422,035 , which compares with $4,375,373 in 1922 , and amounts to $13.21 a share on the common stock , as against $2.56 the year before . The year 1923 was also a record one in the amount of freight handled . <P> In still another way this annual 1923 report of the B. &; O. is interesting . Total assets of the company as of Dec. 31 , 1923 , were $900,191,932 . While the B. &; O. is not as yet a " billion dollar concern , " it is nearer that mark than is commonly realized .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
