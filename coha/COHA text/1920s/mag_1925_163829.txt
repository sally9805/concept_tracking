It is not ethical for physicians to advertise except by a neat name- sign in the window of their residences . Seldom does one see in the public press such cards as : Dr. Lafcadio Schnapps <P> Will Cure <P> Colds , eczema , intestinal stasis , pneumonia and warts <P> He will cut corns , appendixes , adenoids , goiters <P> and his rates ( for cash customers ) . . . <P> Office Hours , 8 to 8 <P> But for a long time magazines , newspapers , have been embellished with arresting advertisements like one that the New York Times carried last week : <P> New Years for Old How old do you think you are ? The family Bible will not tell you . The calendar will not guide you . " Born January 1st , 1886 " does not tell you the condition of your tissues . It is your condition that counts and you can not find that out in the birth records . You can find it through a health examination at the Life Extension Insti- tute . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health examinations of the Life Extension Institute ... <P> LIFE EXTENSION INSTITUTE , INC . <P> 25 West 43rd Street , New York <P> Telephone : Vanderbilt 1494 <P> People who do not happen to be numbered among the " 400,000 other men and women who have taken the health examinations " have often wondered just what sort of organization this Institute is , and how it is regarded by conservative , practising physicians . Last week Dr. Morris Fishbein , Editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association curtly described it as " a middleman , which deals with the patient , collects the fee , and then doles out to the physician what is conceived to be an adequate share . " He said : <P> " The commercial organizations in this field vary in size and scope from one with some 8,000 or more affiliated medical examiners to the one - room commercial laboratory devoted almost wholly to periodic examinations of urine . . . . <P> " It is time that the medical profession opposed vigorously the com- mercialization of medical practice . The greatest opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of periodic physical examination by individual physicians . Experience has shown that the patient is best served by a competent physician who is intimately acquainted with his problem , who has served his family for many years and who will be able to conduct such an examination according to a systematic plan .
