At the loan show of the Contemporary Art Society in Colnaghi 's , Bond St. , London , the Prime Minister of England opened an exhibition of modernist French painting . Represented were Braque , Perain , Dufresne , Dufy , Flandrin , Friez , Marchand , Matisse , Picasso , Segonzac , Utrillo , Bonnard . The Prime Minister seemed quite familiar with such names and quite at home in the midst of Contemporary Art . " He proceeded to state , without false gusto , a few simple truths about Art , pointing out that Art , like Nature , never dies , that the old masters of today were once contemporaries , a fact too frequently forgotten by their exclusive worshippers , that the contemporaries of today will be the old masters of tomorrow , and that the function of the enlightened is to select them . He dwelt with considerable warmth on the part which Art and its appreciation plays in overcoming national prejudices , and securing international concord , concluding with a tribute to French genius .
