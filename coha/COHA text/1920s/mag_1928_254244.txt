Lonely and bleak is the Scottish castle of Achmacarry . Trout leap warily in its streams . Startled grouse fill its woods with low thunder . Bold would he be of heart , who went alone to Castle Achmacarry , as the enemy of its famed tenant , Sir Henri Wilhelm August Deterding , director-general of Royal Dutch Shell Oil . <P> Last week , there came to Castle Achmacarry one Walter Clark Teagle , president of the greatest of U. S. oil companies , Standard Oil of New Jersey . He carried a gun . But his friends were not alarmed . They recalled that Oilman Teagle and Oilman Deterding , mighty rivals , were yet friends . They remembered that Oilman Teagle had tried to be peacemaker in the recent Indian oil war between Royal Dutch and Standard Oil of New York . They guessed the two chiefs would discuss ways and means of persuading Soviet Russia to compensate U. S. , British and Dutch companies for confiscated oil wells . <P> Conspicuously absent from this friendly , oily shooting party was Charles F. Meyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace with Sir Henri , actually the bitter commercial enemy of Dutch Shell .
