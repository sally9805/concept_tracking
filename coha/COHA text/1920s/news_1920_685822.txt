txt The Largest Universities . To the Editor of The New York Times : Permit me to call your attention to an error which appears in an article published I today concerning the registration at Columbia University . The article refers to Columbia University as " the largest in the world . with Leland Stanford , Jr. , University second in registration . " The fact is that Leland Stanford , Jr. , is a small university with no desire to be large . For years it has sucicectied in remaining small by restricting the 1 number of freshmen and the number of women admitted . The writer of the article probably was thinking of the University of California , I which is about thirty miles from Stanford . I there the registration is unrestricted , as is characteristic of State universities . For several years the University of California has been second in size to Columbia . JOHN L. SEATON . Educational Director , Board of Education , Methodist Episcopal Church . New York , Sept. 26. 1920.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
