The gnomelike figure of Dwight Whitney Morrow , U. S. Ambassador to Mexico , remitted its busy comings and goings in Mexico City last week and quietly lay , bolstered among fat white pillows , in bed . Ambassador Morrow had a fever ; nothing serious , just a touch of grippe . Affairs of state awaited his mending . But there was no pause in the restless activity of Mr. Morrow 's mind , which , accustomed to strenuous exercise , cried out for diversion at least . When his physician refused him permission to work , Mr. Morrow said : " All right , then , I will enjoy myself as I always do when I have to stay in bed . " <P> Ambassadorial secretaries were soon ferreting about at Mexico City 's newsstands and bookstalls . Back they went to the embassy laden with all magazines and novels " which seemed to promise thrills or mysteries . " The hot sun soared over Mexico . Mr. Morrow lay among the big pillows reading . As the afternoon shadows lengthened , a secretary was again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bookstalls . The gnomelike figure among the pillows , habituated to reading rapidly through complex business and legal documents , had used up more detective stories before sunset than most men could read in a week . " Almost a dozen , " said the Associated Press reporter assigned to the case . <P> The secretary returned again with a fresh armful of thrills , mysteries .
