In the city of Winnipeg , in the province of Manitoba last week a tall , ascetic-looking man wandered , but not aimlessly about the city . Here and there he let it be known that Winnipeg suited him . A good town for a breakfast-food factory . No remittance-man he ; his accent was not that of an Englishman , but of a U. S. Southerner . His appearance was not that of an Englishman come to make good in the Dominion , but of a U. S. business man , albeit he was less jovial , perhaps a little harder than most U. S. citizens . As suddenly as they had begun , the man 's wanderings ceased . The police had some questions to ask him . The most important question was , " Are you Clinton S. Carnes ? " When the man said he was Clinton S. Carnes , the police were proud of their perspicacity . Here was important fish for their creel . <P> A few hours later Georgians knew about the catch in Canada . Soon Carnes would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited to hear what Carnes would say about the million dollars or more which represented the shortages in the accounts of the Southern Baptist Convention 's Home Mission Board . Carnes had been treasurer of the board until he left Atlanta on or about Aug. 15 , nor had he resigned . <P> Almost eleven years ago , when the perfunctory audit of the Home Mission Board was completed , a tall , ascetic-looking auditor made apt suggestions , so impressed the star Boarders that they sent for him a few months later when the treasurer of the Home Mission Board resigned . The job included control of the board 's funds , paid a salary of $4,500 a year . <P> Some 3,000,000 persons annually contribute $1,000,000 each year to these mission funds . Many a widow 's mite , many a tot 's tithe swells the total . Part of Treasurer Carnes 's job was to lend money to needy wayside churches , and Treasurer Carnes thereby made contacts with wayside bankers , whom he won as he had won the board . His word alone was good at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $10,000 and like sums " for the board . " <P> During his more than ten years ' tenure of office Treasurer Carnes prospered , became Realtor Carnes , Millionaire Carnes , Altruist Carnes . The treasurer dabbled in real estate , owned in Atlanta at the end of a decade personal and real estate to the sum of $3,357,193.71 . When a church needed $13,000 , the altruist gave it ; when a ministerial student needed funds to complete his education , the altruist supplied them . An impressive home , four automobiles , educated sons added to the prestige of Treasurer Carnes . <P> On Aug. 15 last he closed his desk , said was going North on business . A few days later a series of revelations and a contemporaneous series of shocks began . Treasurer Carnes 's accounts were audited-no perfunctory audit , this-and Baptists earned that the accounts were a million , perhaps more , dollars short . The Atlanta Constitution printed on its front page a facsimile of a postal department dossier which showed that Carnes twice had been indicted for using the mails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early thought of the honor and credit of the Home Mission Board , immediately established a restitution fund to make up Carnes 's alleged defalcations.
