Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd sat sombrely in his snug Antarctic base last week , thinking of Laurence McKinley Gould , Harold J. June and Bernt Balchen , who the previous week had flown to the Rockefeller Mountains , 128 miles away . By radio they had reported their arrival there , then fallen silent for days . <P> As the Commander sat silently planning rescue , Reporter Russell Owen radioed sad conjectures to the New York Times . <P> After dog teams had started for the mountains , Commander Byrd with Malcolm Hanson and Dean Smith chanced a flight to what disaster they knew not . They found the first party miserable but safe in a wind-ripped , snow-clogged tent . A 150 m. p. h. gale had blown their heavy plane away together with their radio set . <P> Commander Byrd sent Flyer Smith back to the base with Balchen and June , and stayed in the mountains with Gould and Hanson . Two days later Flyer Smith returned with June and flew the three others back to the base camp . <P> Reporter Owen , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangered the party ( TIME , Feb. 11 ) , this time abstained from hysterics and heroics . Perhaps having heard echoes of the way some of his romantic writings have been received in the U. S. , he let Harold June dictate a first-hand account of almost incredible winds in the Rockefeller Mountains . <P> After the Gould trio had landed among the icy mountains , pegged down their plane and set up their tent , a fierce wind rose from the north . Their indicator showed it roaring 85 m. p. h . The wind grew stronger . The plane bobbed up and down against its stay ropes . Stronger the wind . Gould , holding a rope , " was blown straight out like a flag . " The men hugged the ice , dug knives into it to keep from blowing away . " The wind bellowed and shrieked at us . Pieces of snow , big lumps , began to hit us . They were pieces of packed snow from the mountain two miles away . " <P> Fiercer the wind . At 150 m.p.h. it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whirled her backwards for half a mile . The three men , planeless , could only wait wet and miserable for rescue . It came . <P> <P> * Hurricanes ( typhoons sea cyclones ) reach 150 m. p. h. , tornadoes ( land cyclones ) 300 m. p. h . Conservative calculations estimate the force of a hurricane at more than 100 billion horsepower . The 1926 Miami hurricane is calculated to have had enough power to run every dynamo , motor and steam engine in the world for 20 years .
