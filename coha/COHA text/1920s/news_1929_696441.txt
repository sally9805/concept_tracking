txt U. S. Steel rose to the highest price of its history yesterday at the head of a further bullish demonstration in the general market . Unfavorable sentiment created by the ** increase in brol ? ? rs ' loans last week was offset by the reduction of $69,300,000 in rediscounts at the Federal Reserve , which reflected the success of efforts on part of member banks to cut down their indebtedness . As a result , the general market continued along the lines it has followed recently . Profittaking went ahead in various departments , while buying activities were prosecuted with undiminished vigor in the rails , utilities and many sections of the industrial list . Steel 's further upsurge into record territory was due to powerful buying based on the expectation of a split-up of the present stir . r before the end of the year . It was asserted in well-informed quarters that this readjustment would be made on a two-for-one basis with a $4 dividend on the new shares . This would be equivalent to an increase in the present $7 payment to rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of easemenL As on the previous day , renewal of standing loans was arrangea at 8% . However , large offerings of funds pcured into the Street , and the demand rate ware forced down to 7% , with accommodations available outside as low as 6% during the afternoon Bull operators were encouraged by credit developments , and the market 's indifference to the new high in brokers ' loans- Buying activities proceeded on a broad front the greater part of the day . New York Central stood out among the highgrade rails , soaring to a new record high on the prospect of an increase in the present return to shareholders , both through upward revision of the regular $8 payment , and the offering of rights from time to time . Delaware , Lackawanna S. Western achieved its best price since 1927 , and aggressive advances were staged in St. Paul preferred , Erie common , and various other issues of the more speculative class . In the utility category strong demand continued in evidence . carrying Standard Gas &; Electric and Public Service of New Jersey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest levels reached since the stock sold exrights . ? In addition to rumors of a capital readjustment , Steel common had the stimulus of brilliant earnings statements from independent steel companies . Following Republic Iron 's recent report of a balance of $6 42 a common share for the first six months this year , against $1.11 in the corresponetng period last year , Youngstown Sheet &; Tube reported a showing of $10 12 a. common share , against $3.65 in the first halt of 1928 . Steel 's statement for the first six months will be given out July 30 . While its percentage of gain in this period was not so great as Youngstown 's or Republic 's , nevertheless the corporation made a , highly favorable showing . and its figures for operations in the first half year are expected to furnish ample justification for the present selling level of the stock . ? National Power &; Light and'Eleetric Power AC Light were absorbed in large blocks , and both shares moved up to the best levels of the , current advance . These two stocks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength reflected progress in steps toward a consolidation . Pacific coast utilities also were strong , particularly Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &; Electric . The latter two stocks also were influenced by the belief that a merger is in prospect . Both companies operate in the same territory , and a consolidation would bring about substantial reduction in overhead . ? ? ? Motor shares continued to afford an exception to the general strength of the market . General Motors , Chrysler and other leaders of this class were persistently offered at the low levels of the movement . Heaviness in the automobile division reflected nervousness over competitive conditions in the industry . Reports from Detroit said that Nash planned to market an eight-cylinder car to compete with Roosevelt , and that Chrysler might devote intensive efforts to the four-cylinder field in view of the current Ford success . Interests bearish on the motor shares also found justification for their position in General Motors tales by dealers to users last month , which totaled 194.705 units . against 214.870 in May and 206.295 in June , 1928 . Reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were current two years ago , have recently been revived . No intimation that such a step is under contemplation has been forthcoming from official sources , but wellinformed interests feel there are cogent reasons for a combination of this character . It is argued that the campaigns of retail store expansion which the two companies are conducting are involving duplication of capital investment which a merger would obviate , as well as resulting in more economical operation of the mail order lines This suggestion is coming principally from Wall Street interests who have been successful in the stock of both companies , but it is given greater significance by changes in the management over the last few years which have removed obstacles to the two companies getting together . ? Bullard Co .. a newcomer of the Iast few months on the big board , was a strong spot of the specialty class , rising to new high ground for the year on active demand . This strength reflected the operations of a new group which is taking a position in the stock on the possibilities involved in a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production of iron and steel castings . Bullard Co. is a large manufacturer ? f automatic machinery extensively used in the automobile industry . Ford is one of its big customers . ? Better behavior on part of Anaconda and other leaders of the copper group reflected advices by interests in close touch with trade conditions mentioning the possibility of higher prices for the metal . Copper buying has been small both at home and abroad as consumers have held of in the hope of obtaining price concessions . But it is declared in conservative and well-informed quarters that large consumers are becoming convinced that the price structure is firmer than had been thought . It is pointed out that if too many buyers reached that conclusion at once , a scramble to obtain the metal would ensue , making higher price levels inevitable . At any rate , it is argued that recent reports of a reduction were poorly Sounded and continuance of the present 18-cent figure will assure high earnings this year for the principal producers . This thought has brought excellent buying on the recent reaction into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues of this group , which are selling on a high yield basis , and promise even larger returns if conditions in the industry continue sound .
