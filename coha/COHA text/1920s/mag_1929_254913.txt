The Living Corpse . In Moscow , toward the end of the 19th Century , it was a gypsy singer , her grave gypsy songs , and the sultry , southern wines which drew Fedya Protasov away from his home and a sweet wife who tried helplessly to forget him . But Fedya , despite his weak lips and wanton tastes , was not the total wreckage that he seemed . For one thing , he never took advantage of the passion innocently offered him by his beloved Masha , the gypsy . For another , he never told lies , so that rather than commit the wholesale falsification necessary to give his wife a divorce , he pretended to kill himself ( he was not brave enough for real suicide ) so that she could marry a devoted , comfortable suitor . When Fedya 's ruse was discovered years later and he learned that , depending on the courts , he had either to remarry his wife or be exiled with her to Siberia for bigamy , he did find the courage to shoot himself . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coiled complex of frailty and nobility , such as his creator Tolstoy and that other great Russian , Dostoievsky , were particularly apt to conceive . As acted by Jacob Ben-Ami and a large company of Eva Le Gallienne 's Civic Repertory Theatre ( including a witty bit by the directress herself ) , most of the values of this celebrated tragedy are apparent . Egon Brecher 's depiction of Alexandrov , an artistic hobo with delusions of grandeur , is an uproarious triumph if you can overlook its tragic perspectives . <P> Mr. Ben-Ami prefers understatement . When it is necessary for him to lie in vinous stupor on a couch , he forms no such abandoned arabesques with his body as did John Barrymore , who acted an adaptation of this play ( Redemption ) several years ago . Deliberate , warm , avoiding histrionism. the current Fedya invites comparison rather with the splendid performance given by the famed German actor Alexander Moissi during last year 's visit to Manhattan . <P> Whirlpool , in which handsome Edward Leiter represented a small town pastor 's struggle against sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was earnest and trite . Most of its potential public were busy with Christmas shopping . <P> The Amorous Antic . Harlow Balsam ( Frank Morgan ) is engaged in writing a play which incorporates such progressive features as a girl on a bicycle and a bishop , both nude , but appearing in total darkness . His wife Sena ( Phoebe Foster ) is painting a geometrical portrait of Percival Redingote ( Alan Mowbray ) who , in turn , is about to carve a bust of Sena . Because Miss Foster is a brittle beauty , Mr. Morgan an absurd farceur , and Jo Mielziner , who designed the scenery , knows how to burlesque the futuristic trend , this satire on ultra-modern estheticism by Novelist Ernest Pascal ( The Marriage Bed ) has its memorable moments . What the quaint older generation would have called a love affair occurs to Sena and Percival . To them it is merely a biological barb which can be plucked out in one assignation , leaving them to work in peace and with increased artistic comprehension of each other . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to even one evening of adultery on his wife 's part . Naturally , she had told him her plans .
