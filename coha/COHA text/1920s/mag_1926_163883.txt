U. S. horsewomen , used as they are to coursing astride , noted with secret mockery British news of last week that " a reaction had started in favor of the sidesaddle and the graceful riding habit of a generation ago , as against the man 's saddle and the riding breeches of today . " The objections to the man 's saddle , besides the supposedly esthetic ones , were based on the quasi-medical grounds that the muscles of a woman 's thighs were less strong than the corresponding ones of a man and that therefore a woman was less secure astride a horse-would be more safe while grasping the pommels of a sidesaddle . These muscles , as everyone should know , are the pectineus ( comblike ) and the adductores magnus , longus and brevis ( the great , long and short pullers-in ) and connect the femur ( the thigh bone , the longest in the body ) to the front lower ridges of the sacrum . They adduct the thighs powerfully and are especially used in horse exercise , the saddle being grasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most superficial muscle of the inner aspect of the thigh , is relatively weak . ) Nerves concerned are the anterior femoral cutaneous , the lumboinguinal and the ilioinguinal . <P> Now when a woman takes to horses after adolescence and then chiefly for show , there is some truth in the opinion of the British mooter of the subject , * because her thigh muscles may not have been adequately strengthened in girlhood . But for the girl taught to ride astride from childhood there need be no such fear for her or for her health . She will have learned balance , kept her spine straight , and strengthened her abdominal and thoracic muscles as well as those of her legs . She can keep her seat in a walk , amble , trot , canter , gallop or jump , even in the English saddle with its low pommel and cantle . In the McClellan saddle of the U. S. Army or the cowboy saddle of the ranches , she will have even a more secure seat , as can testify famed Rodeo Rider " Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club. + She never found anything exotic or treacherous in a man 's saddle , and certainly would never weary her pony with the heavier sidesaddle . <P> * One Horace Smith , perhaps retired Lt.
