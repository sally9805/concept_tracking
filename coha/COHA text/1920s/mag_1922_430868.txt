It was between the years 1251-0 and 12550 that Lora John Manners , afterwards Duke of Rutland , wrote this prayer which little English peasant children used to say at bedtime and sing in the mission schools . In his early youth Lord John also wrote a suitable supplication for his own class as well : Let wealth and commerce , laws and learning die , But leave us still our old Nobility ! He was a kindly , benevolent , polished English country gentleman , wishful only to keep all . things and all persons in that harmony which he and most of the aristocracy of his day believed was foreordained by the Almighty . Some years later his wife , Lady John Manners , traveling in various European countries , studied the working people of the Continent in the only way she knew , poor lady ! as an outsider and an onlooker ? and failed , as all such students must fail , in the sympathy that real understanding begets . On her return to England she wrote of the gay costumes of the peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the " English peasant class " wore no such distinctive garments . They failed to brighten up the countryside and make quaint and pretty pictures in lane and meadow , to divert the worried minds of the squire and his relations and visitors as they walked or drove or rode about the great estates , like unto that of this same Duke of Rutland , who died at a great old age , possessed of sixty-two thousand acres of land , besides great mineral wealth , and a wonderful picture gallery in his castle of Belvoir.  | Despite the absence of gaily-dressed peasantry in those mid-Victorian days , there was little need for the aristocracy to mourn a lack of outward distinction of class . Tenants were not only respectful , but subservient to the lords of the manors ; the ploughman and the yokel walked abjectly and touched their forelocks when they met their " betters " ; dairymaids and housemaids curtsied and did as they were bid , and the clergy had little difficulty in teaching the catechism to the children of the working people in town and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present-day inconvenient question : " Who are my betters ' ? " when admonished by the catechism to " order myself lowly and reverently before my betters " ; or , if the question was ever asked , it was immediately settled by the reply : " Why , that means the gentry , the Squire , the Duchess , your employers and , of course , the Queen and the members of the royal family ! " And then no child would question further . But occasionally an older person was known to find in such answer a cause for dissent and argument and further questions , and perhaps it was the knowledge that such questions , spoken and unspoken , were becoming more frequent than of yore that led Lord John Manners , with just a little faltering of the heart , to pray for the continuance of the old nobility . In studying the history of Britain 's progress toward democracy , I have been struck with the fact that always that progress has been made as an answer to some persistent and often embarrassing question . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean forward and to listen intently during the hour known as " Question Time , " when the British Premier and his ministers are required by members of the House to answer questions , telling the whys and wherefores of political things that be or are proposed to be ? Many a government has fallen , many a political revolution been brought about by the mere asking of a question at the psychological moment . As in Parliament , so it has been outside of Parliament . Since the first step toward democracy was taken when the Barons asked some leading questions of King John , whose unsatisfactory answers caused them to wrest from him the Great Charter , there have always been people in Britain with a perfect passion for " wanting to know why . " One of the most persistent of the old-time questioners was John Ball , the priest of Kent , who , in 1377 , with a small body of followers , went up and down the highways and byways of England singing :  | When Adam delved and Eve span , ' Who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centuries that have followed , that pertinent question has been asked in Britain , and as the generations have gone by , it has been asked with increasing force by increasing numbers , until , at the present time , a great multitude of men , women and children are asking it , some in one form , some in another , and demanding an answer . " Who are my betters ' ? " asks the little girl who is preparing for her confirmation in the church . Now , if that little girl is the daughter of an agricultural laborer on some great landlord 's estate , the curate or the vicar may hedge and . try to point out that the Bible teaches submission to " those in authority over us , " which would seem to include the Squire , the Duke and the Duchess , their sons and daughters and so forth . But in London and in other large cities it is becoming what might be called " the fashion " to tell her that her " betters " are the " more good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning mood there have been certain ones in authority who have refused to answer their queries , or have answered only evasively . This was particularly the case in the latter days of the eighteenth century , those years following the French Revolution , when the English proletariat , pondering upon what the French had done in their progress toward freedom , were heard here and there to utter sounds of revolt , especially during the famines in the manufacturing and  | agricultural districts . Those were the days when Hannah More , Wilberforce , Paley and other religious workers amongst the poor , answered their questions by preaching resignation to their lot . During the famine of 1792 , in what she meant to be a sympathetic talk with her starving brothers and sisters , Hannah More said : Let me remind you that probably this scarcity has been permitted by an all-wise Providence to show the poor how immediately they are dependent upon the rich , and to show both rich and poor how they are all dependent upon Himself . It has also enabled you to see more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this country ? to observe the benefits flowing from the distinction of rank and fortune , which enabled the high so liberally to assist the low ; for I leave you to judge what would have been the state of the poor of this country in this long , distressing scarcity , had it not been for your superiors . Then the gentle Hannah reminded them how thankful they should be that she had so thoroughly instructed them in the Bible , inasmuch as large numbers of them were able to repeat by heart the whole of the first twenty chapters of Genesis ! Wilberforce , too , though he worked for and finally achieved the abolition of slavery among the blacks , told the starving white English men and women and children that their " more lowly path had been allotted to them by the hand of God , the present state of things is very short , and the peace of mind which religion offers indiscriminately to all ranks , affords more true satisfaction than all the expensive pleasures that are beyond the poor man 's reach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much-studied text book in the higher schools , went even further and told the poor that " frugality itself is a pleasure , because it is an exercise of attention and continence , which , when it is successful , produces satisfaction . All the provisions which a poor man 's child requires are industry and innocence . " It speaks much for the patience of the poor of those days that Hannah More , Wilberforce , and Paley all lived to a good old age and died quietly in their beds !  | Yet there can be no doubt that this sort of specious reasoning served to hasten the progress toward democracy , for still the people questioned , sometimes among themselves , sometimes of the governing classes , and always in their hearts . The Reform Act of 1832 gave the suffrage to the middle classes , and the people immediately below them asked why all householders and lodgers should not have the vote , which they did not obtain till 1867 . Then agricultural laborers asked questions and agitated , until finally " universal suffrage " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During all this time only a little questioning had been done by the women of England , and part of that was silent questioning , except for those few noble pioneers of the woman suffrage movement who became known as " the Shrieking Sisterhood . " But lo ! suddenly in the early years of the twentieth century a few women stood up in political meetings and in the time-honored custom among men , said they wished to ask a question . Of government ministers and parliamentary candidates they asked : " What about votes for women ? " In the midst of the women 's questioning , Britain took the most forward step toward democracy since the signing of Magna Charta . Indeed , it might be called a stride or , better still , a jump . This was the passing of the House of Lords as a law-making body and the ringing of the death knell of hereditary legislative powers . It was in 1911 when Lloyd George was Chancellor of the Exchequer in a Liberal government . He was then a Radical of the Radicals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dukes . " His first budget was an attack on dukes and all other great landlords , for he proposed a new kind of taxation on land and land values . Though passed by the Commons , the Lords vetoed the budget , a thing they had never done before to a " money bill . " It was really a very personal thing to the Lords , since they owned most of the land ! Then the Liberal government ground its teeth and " went to the country , " and the  | Lords passed the budget forthwith ; whereupon they were given another bill to pass , one that would deprive them of all power to veto a money bill in the future or indefinitely to hold up any other bill . Most naturally the Lords refused to pass what they called this " revolutionary measure . " Then there was still another election , after which Mr. Asquith , then Premier , threatened to create four or five hundred Liberal peers to make a sufficient majority to pass the bill . These new peers , Samson-like , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . In order to keep out what they called " Asquith 's four hundred blackleg , bastard peers , " the Lords finally passed this Parliament Act . So the House of Lords was forced to emasculate itself and it became a political eunuch . There were a few " die-hards " among them who voted against the bill to the very end . Among these was that most reactionary of Tories , Lord Willoughby de Broke , who , as the bill passed , shouted that it would be the first duty and the first act of the Conservative party , when it should come into power , to give back to the Lords the power that was taken from them . This same peer is now one of the leaders of those who are looking back longingly to the old flesh pots of Egypt . To that amazing book " Some False Assumptions of Democracy , " just out , by Captain Anthony Ludovici , Lord Willoughby de Broke has written a most commendatory preface . Captain Ludovici ( who , by the way , is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of another book called " A Defence of Aristocracy . " To understand what the present reactionaries of Britain are standing for , one needs to read and digest some quotations from these books : On the question of Aristocracy , the point of view of the man in the street simply does not matter . * There are two kinds of men , the Vulgar and the Few . Captain Ludovici is out and out for a government by a benevolent aristocracy . He refers to aristocracy as a " Divine institution , " and to the proletariat as people of " subject mind . " His idea of Liberalism is similar to the opinion expressed by Disraeli in 1872 , when he declared :  | The tone and tendency of Liberalism can not be concealed . It is to attack the institutions of the country under the name of reform , and to make war on the manners and customs of the people of the country under the pretext of progress . The war , and with it the need of forming the Coalition of the Liberal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the peers and the people , between aristocracy and democracy , for that was really the proper name for the contest between the Lords and the Commons in 1911 , or perhaps we might call it the skirmishing preparatory to the great battle . The greater danger which confronted England brought aristocrats and all the commoners together for nearly five years , when they knew they were fighting for their very skins , and they learned to know and appreciate one another better . To their credit be it said that now there are members of some of the greatest and oldest families of England who realize the absurdities of caste and class distinction , and are prepared to number themselves among the people in the fight against the peers , a fight which can not be long delayed . Any student of English history can not fail to have noticed that always such men have appeared at times of crises . In the year 1780 the then Duke of Richmond had the courage to introduce a bill for the granting of universal suffrage , and Lord John Russell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most active workers for the Reform Bill . In certain respects the state of England today is somewhat similar to that following the French Revolution . That is to say , the great war through which we have passed has set all classes to thinking of political and social equality , and revealed to the upholders of class privilege the real insecurity of their position . This has put a great fear into the hearts of aristocrats and given them a newly awakened instinct of self-preservation . Most particularly is this the case with the great land owners , all of whom belong to the  | nobility . Nine-tenths of the land of the country belongs to one-tenth of the population , and it needs but the change of an apostrophe in the quaint old motto engraved over the entrance to the London Royal Exchange to make it describe most fitly the present situation : The earth is the Lords ' , and the fulness thereof . Once again the people are asking questions , and there is now no attempt to answer them by preaching resignation or telling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they shall dwell in mansions surrounded by Elysian fields in the life to come . Indeed , some of the clergy of the Established Church are now among the leaders of the people . For example , the old church of the parish in which I reside , St. Paul 's , Covent Garden , of which one of England 's wealthiest dukes has " the gift of the living , " has for its vicar , Reverend the Honorable James Adderley , son of a peer and brother of the present Lord Norton . During his conduct of children 's service one day recently , he was leading the boys and girls in the singing of that hymn beloved of English children , " All Things Bright and Beautiful , " when , coming to the third verse , he said : " Children , do n't sing the next verse , because it is a lie ! " This is the verse which Canon Adderley has told me he never allows sung in his church : The rich man in his castle , The poor man at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered their estate . One can not write about the British aristocracy without referring to the English Established Church , for most of its clergy , its bishops and leading laymen belong to what are known as the " upper classes . " The Church has always been conservative , indeed reactionary , and can not be said to have been the friend of the poor . In 1844 the great and good Earl of Shaftesbury declared sorrowfully : The bishops are timid , time-serving , and great worshippers of wealth and power . I can scarcely recall an instance in which a clergyman has been found to maintain the cause of the laborers against the pew holders .  | This description , however , does not fit the whole church as we find it today . There are bishops who refuse to live in their palaces and are leading self-denying lives . In answer to a question I have put to several bishops recently , I have been assured that their palace wine cellars have been empty and closed up for years , and more than a dozen bishops have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergy are agitating for disestablishment , and others are protesting against the law which prohibits their sitting in the House of Commons . There are , too , women belonging to the Church of England who are fighting against its conservatism and what they describe as its lack of vision . They are demanding a reform of those parts of the Prayer Book which discriminate against their sex , and they are demanding what they call " a clean and decent marriage service , which shall not be an insult to every good man and good woman . " They ask for the ordination of women , so that a woman of the nobility and brilliance of Miss Maude Royden , daughter of the late Sir Thomas Royden , Baronet , shall be allowed to conduct services in the Established Church , of which she is a member . At present Miss Royden is preaching to crowded congregations in Eccleston Guildhall . Most interesting to relate , although she is not ordained or given charge of any one church , she does sometimes preach in certain of the Established churches by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fact that the bishops have requested their clergy not to invite her to do this , and implored Miss Royden not to accept such invitations ! For here is one of the anomalies of the Church of England , bound to and up with the state as it is ; dependent upon the House of Commons even to allow it to make a change in its prayer book ; powerful as it is or was in the House of Lords , with twenty-four bishops and two archbishops sitting there as Lords Spiritual , obstructing divorce and other much needed reforms in the law ; it can not control its own clergy when once they have obtained a " living , " which  | gives them a life income and a life incumbency . So long as a clergyman does not commit a crime against the law of the land , or lead a life of intolerable scandal , he retains his place , preaching any doctrine which best suits him . His " living " may be the gift of a duke or a marquess , yet , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may daily preach death and damnation to all dukes and marquesses , and the particular duke or marquess can not close his church against him , nor empty it of congregation ? though the duke or the marquess may , naturally , decline to worship at that particular church . So , in spite of the fact that the Established Church is in some respects a church in chains , and in others a church autocratic and aristocratic , its clergy have more personal freedom than the clergy of any other church in the world . If all the clergy could be induced to use this freedom for the good of all the people and the real glory of God , they might , indeed , be the means of setting up a veritable Kingdom of Heaven on English earth . But if we study the history of the English Church we find that it is really progressing ? gradually , slowly , painfully , and sometimes unwillingly , toward democracy . A year before the war , when the women 's suffrage agitation was at its height , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churchwoman , against the burning of some of the beautiful historic little country churches . " We must burn them ! " she said . " We have decided that the only way to lighten the darkness of our clergy is by the torch of a burning church . " I am not prepared to say that it was only the burning of the churches that converted the English clergy to the idea of freedom for women , but certainly after the militant campaign many English church divines confessed to seeing a great light . Charles Kingsley spoke of the duty of the Church to " justify God to the People , " and this is a thing that some of England 's great churchmen are now determined to do . Already the Bishop of Manchester is sending out a call for a conference in 1923 to discuss the subject of " Applied Christianity " to labor and politics . 390 So far we have noted the progress toward democracy , but to say that Britain has already attained to real democracy , either politically or socially , would be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans , particularly wealthy ones who have lived in England , are fond of asserting that in Great Britain there is a larger amount of freedom than in the United States . They point to the facts that a government , or an administration , as we should call it , can be turned out over-night if it displeases the people ; that British judges are appointed by the King for life and therefore have no temptation to do other than render always justice to rich and poor alike . Now , it is true that a government can be turned out overnight , but not because it displeases the people . It is often turned out because of a " split " in the party which put it in . Also it is not true that politics have nothing to do with the appointment of judges . It is but a pleasant fiction that the King appoints the judges . The selection of judges is entirely in the hands of the Lord Chancellor , who " advises " the King to sign the appointment ? and the King always signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only real " prerogative of the sovereign " is his duty to do precisely what his ministers " advise " him to do . If he refused , then the government would resign , and no other body of politicians would be willing to form another government under a sovereign who did not follow the " advice " of his ministers ! The Lord Chancellor is a member of the cabinet and a member of the party in power . He owes his position to his politics and he can , if he wishes , fill every vacant judgeship with a member of his own party . These judges retain their appointments , though the Lord Chancellor goes out with his own party government . One needs only to mention the name of Sir Edward Carson , now Lord Carson , the great Ulster leader and lawyer , as an example p 391 of what a barrister-politician can do after he is appointed to the bench . The present Lord Chancellor , Lord Birkenhead , is among the leaders of the Conservatives . It was he who , as Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Parliament Bill in the House of Commons , and he is now one of the reactionaries who are insisting upon a " reform " of the House of Lords that is restoring to them the power which the Parliament Act took from them , and he declares that any new sort of House of Lords which may be the result of the " reformation " must , in part , at least , have an hereditary basis , a statement that gives Liberals and Laborites a hearty laugh . One can not imagine a Chief Justice of the United States taking any such part in politics as the British Lord Chancellor always takes . I have shown how , in the matter of the franchise , Britain has progressed toward democracy ; but there is not equality of suffrage or universal suffrage , and , although it is no longer true , as it was up to 1918 , that a wealthy man owning twenty different residences in different constituencies is entitled to twenty votes , there is still a property qualification which will enable a man to vote twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employing thousands of workingmen and women has a vote in the constituency where the factory is situated , and also another vote in another constituency where his palatial residence is situated . All his thousands of employees have only one vote each , which is in accordance with their residence . Being employees , instead of employers , in the factory , they can not vote for the factory , but only for their residences . Holders of degrees from the great universities have also two votes , one for their university candidate and one for the candidate who represents the constituency where they reside . Although in 1918 some women were given the vote , the election law does not give the vote to all women over thirty , as it was said to do . A domestic servant who sleeps in the house where she works has no vote , though she is over thirty ; one woman sharing a residence with another woman can not vote unless she owns the furniture in her part of the flat or house . There are various little differences between the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides the unjust and absurd one giving votes to boys of twenty-one while denying it to the most brilliant and capable women in the country if they happen to be under thirty .  | It can not be said that there is real representative government in Britain so long as it is so difficult for an independent candidate to stand for Parliament with no party machine and party chest behind him . Any man who wishes to stand for Parliament must first deposit one hundred and fifty pounds as an evidence of his good faith . This will be returned to him only if he polls a certain number of votes . His electoral contest will cost him , out of pocket , from eight hundred to a thousand pounds . In the selection of a cabinet , many British people complain that there is absolute lack of democracy . For instance , the Premier can hand over the whole foreign policy of the country to a peer who was never chosen by the people to represent them in Parliament , whereas if he chooses a commoner as Foreign Secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commons . The custom of " going to the country " and consulting the electorate when a certain plan of action is proposed by the Premier and his ministers is good as far as it works out ; but though " the country " may show by its votes that it approves of that one particular plan , there is nothing to prevent the government from carrying out many other more important plans concerning which it did not consult the electorate . In short , though the British plan of government is theoretically most representative and democratic , in practice it often fails to carry out the wishes of the electorate . Then let it be remembered that there is no limit to the amount of money a wealthy man may contribute to what are known as " party funds , " which has produced the everpresent scandal known as the " sale of honors , " the selling  | of some title or a peerage , by whatever government is in power , to men who have contributed immense sums to the party war chest . In the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this manufacture of peers was a greater danger to democracy than it is at the present time ; but even now there is a great hankering after titles , and the scandal goes on . With all the faults and scandals of American politics , it would be impossible to produce anything so shocking and so insulting to the mere name of democracy as this . A Canadian friend of mine was recently asking an English politician to explain how and why most modern peerages were created , and when the Englishman , all unsuspiciously , referred to the donations to party funds , my friend replied : " Oh , I see ! Over in Canada and the United States we send such men to jail , but you send them to the House of Lords ! " The proletariat are not the only ones who are now asking questions concerning Britain 's government . There are nearly two dozen peeresses in their own right who have not been allowed to sit in the House of Lords on account of their sex . The Viscountess Rhondda , an able and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most militant of the suffragettes who went to prison for the cause , has demanded to know why she was kept out of the House of Lords . Her seat there has just been surrendered to her and other peeresses are also " asking questions " on this subject . There are young men of ambition and democratic tendencies who are forced into the House of Lords against their will , because they have inherited peerages . These are asking why they can not give up their titles and stand for the House of Commons . Under present law they have not even the right to vote for a parliamentary candidate . The other day I heard a business man ask this question : " If this is a democracy , how is it that at functions where there is an order of precedence , the Premier of all Britain must rank below all persons of the blood royal and the Archbishops of Canterbury and York as well ? "  | The Conservatives are trying to evade many of the embarrassing questions that are being put , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfying answers . Most particularly is the Labor Party giving its mind to answering as well as putting questions of its own . It is rapidly drawing to itself many of the " intellectuals . " Already two bishops of the Established Church are working with it and among those who are affiliated with it are such men and women as Jerome K. Jerome , Miss Maude Royden , Maurice Hewlett , Rebecca West , Bernard Shaw , Evelyn Sharp , St. John Ervine , the Sidney Webbs . As I write , along the Strand a procession of unemployed is passing . They are asking a question in chanting , singsong fashion : We 're honest British workmen , and we 've got no work to do ? Why ? Why ? Why ? Tell us why ! Little children along the pavement follow them , children with beautiful though dirty faces ? of all the pretty children I have ever seen the children of the London " working class " stand first ? and as their little feet keep time , their eyes shine with the delight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are humming : Why ? Why ? Why ? Tell us why ! The other day I was talking with an intelligent artisan on the subject of the proposed education " cuts " ; the keeping of children from the council schools till they are six ; the enlarging of the classes ; the saving of money by the re-introduction of inferior teachers in the free schools . " Let them try it ! " he said threateningly . " We laborers are determined that our children shall not be as we have been . We sha n't be satisfied till our children have as good a chance as the children of the United States have . We are going to put men in Parliament who will demand this . It 's the lords and the dukes who do n't want our children educated . Watch us put them out of business ! " And I watch .  |
