Realtors in Peiping ( once Peking ) sat last week in doleful dumps . Not only has the Government of China removed from their city to Nanking ( TIME , April 25 , 1927 ) , but Society and Business are flocking Southward too . Result : real estate values in Peiping had slumped down , last week , to one-third their conservative appraisal seven months ago , when the city was still " Peking " -a name meaning " Northern Capital . " The city 's new name , " Peiping , " means " Northern Peace . " <P> Naturally realtors in " Nanking " or " Southern Capital " sported last week on the crest of a boom which had shot all desirable buildings up to approximately 15 times their former value , with land appraisals up tenfold . <P> So boundless grew the possibilities of profiteering , that the new Nationalist Government hastily drafted and enacted , last week , a drastic " Appreciation Tax " designed to lift some of the burden of wealth from profiteers.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
