The special grand jury which has been investigating the frauds , conspiracies and murders attendant upon Chicago 's primary election last April , last week brought indictments of a police lieutenant , eight racketeers and a large , dark figure who had seemed destined to gain fame in the councils of the nation-Oscar DePriest , first Negro alderman of Chicago , nominee of the G. O. P. to succeed the late famed Martin Barnaby Madden in the House of Representatives . It was not the first time Mr. DePriest had been indicted . In 1916 he was accused of handling tainted money , but the charge languished and died in Chicago 's political limbo . This time the charge was conspiracy to protect gambling and vice resorts on Chicago 's vice-ridden South Side . The boodle exacted went to swell Mayor Thompson 's campaign fund , it was charged . <P> Southerners who read the news smiled grimly . " Down here , " they said , " we 'd just naturally lynch a nigger like that . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
