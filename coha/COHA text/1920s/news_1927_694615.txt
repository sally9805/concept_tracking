txt Columbia University has earned the right to be remembered by some provision in every will that is drawn in New York City because of its service to the community , according to Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler , President of the university , in his 1927 annual report to the Board of Trustees . The report , made public yesterday , again declares that Columbia University " is undercapitalized by some $60,000,000 " for the successful discharge of its present obligations . " The lack of sufficient physical equipment for the present work of the university on Morningside Heights , " says President Butler 's report , " is glaring and almost impossible to explain satisfactorily to students , to visiting scholars and to the public " $3,498,380 Gifts in 1927 . The report says that Columbia 's total gifts in 1927 , including those to Barnard and Teachers Colleges and the College of Pharmacy were $3,498,380.20 ; that since 1890 gifts to Columbia University have aggregated $71,588,763.64 , and that the combined resources of those institutions as of June 30 , 1927 , were $114,153,749.87 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers 2,210 , against 2,092 in 1926 . " It is tiresome to repeat the fact , but , as was shown in detail in the last annual report , the university is undercapitalized by some $60,000,000 for the successful and satisfactory discharge of its present public obligations . " says the report . " It can not possibly be put in funds with which to meet those obligations unless the citizens of New York and of the nation . feeling their moral responsibility for the continuance and prosperity of the great institutions that lead and serve the intellectual life and that organize and promote scientific advance , make constant and large benefactions from the fortunes with which they are happily blessed . " The time should now have come - when. after a century and threequarters of service such as Columbia has rendered , no will should be drawn in the city of New York without containing some provision . large or small , to strengthen the historic institution which has done its full share to make New York a real capital of men and not merely a busy centre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does its public work in the sphere of liberty , not in that of government . All institutions supported by public tax are , and of logical and political necessity should be , controlled and administered directly by public officers . These institutions exist and do their public work in the sphere of government . They are part of government . On the other hand , those institutions , whether eleemosynary. educational , Merely , scientific , historical or other . that grow un in the sphere of liberty , depend for their vitality and effective continuance upon the strength of the spirit of liberty among the people and upon the appreciation by the people of the moral responsibility which faith in liberty of necessity involves . Hopes for Gifts From Wealthy . " Lovers of liberty and men and women bred to liberty who are so fortunate as to have substantial posecssions will increasingly feel that they have not done their duty to society , to their city , their State , their naticn and that they have not met full ? their moral obligations , unless and until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public institutions in the sphere of Liberty . " The spectacle of great fortunee , accumulated however wisely or by whatever effort , being bestowed in huge sums upon a few untrained and inexperienced individuals who happen to be related to the possessors by birth or marriage . without any provision being made for public undertakings in the sphere of Liberty , can only serve as temptation to prohibition or compulsory regulation of private activity and accumulation at the instance of those elements in society which are always on the lookout for ways and means to restrict liberty and to reduce private initiative and private gain to their lowest terms . " Whether a great fortune , made or inherited , is to the public advantage or not , depends not in the least upon its existence or its amount , but upon how it is used by those who have made it or by those to whom it is transmitted . " In a hurried , bustling , shifting age in which there is every sort am kind of novel happening and changing of emphasis the man who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place for himself as a guiding force . This is true not only in respect to financial , industrial and transportation corporations bet even in respect to government itself There is more need than ever for him ' who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all time and all existence . ' The scholar is cornlag to find a firmer economic basis for his place in society . Sees Fatete in Teachers . " Whatever may be the case elsewhere , in the United States teachers themselves , save those exceptions which here as always prove the rule . whether in school . in college or in university , are , and for some time past have been , in large part quite uneducated iu any large and justifiable sense of that word . The elaborate training which they have so often received is a sorry substitute for education . They are high-minded , eager and devoted specialists and illustrate to the full the definition , marked as much by truth as by wit , that the specialist is one who knows snore and more about less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be useful , it is quite futile as an instrument of education . " A neat and well-kept person , good manners , cultivated speech and some appreciation and understanding of the best that has been said and done in the world would constitute a high but practicable ideal for the education of American youth in this twentieth century . The pressure for the acquisition in infancy and adolescence of specific gain-making cornpetences and talents is not a sign of educational progress ; it is a sign of a return to the dark ages , the more dismal and dolorous because so largely unconscious and so usually accompanied by those shouts of triumph with which the barbarian uniformly celebrates his slayings of those things that he destroys because he does not appreciate or understand . " There can he no question that a large part of the enrolment at American universities is the result of artificial stimulation by various more or less unreasonable rules and regulations of boards of education and governing bodies of institutions of higher learning . The insistence that , whether or no , a teacher ambitious for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arts or even Doctor of Philosophy is alarming because of its unreasonableness and its unhappy influences . " This insistence can only result in multiplying many times over the number of graduate students at American universities , while bringing them to look upon their university residence and work as a penance to be endured or a series of forms to be gone through with as patiently , yet as rapidly , as possible . Such artificial rules and regulations tend to destroy that free university spirit , that joy in learning and that zeal for inquiry which are the making of a university spirit which is genuine and enduring . " Then , too , there is that tendency , which appears to be well-nigh irresistible , to specialize so severely during years of graduate residence as to make the student blind and deaf to the wonderful appeal of intellectual color and form which surround him on every side . To have passed through a university and never to have heard or even seen any one of its dozen greatest ornaments whose field of major interest is not that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of opportunity which is nothing short of tragic . " 6,000 Are Barred Yearly . Dr. Butler says ilat the great pressure of those seeking admission to Columbia requires " severe labor , broad outlook and great discretion " in selecting the eligibles , and that 6,000 a year are turned away . The re port continues : " As schools , colleges and universities increase in enrolment there is much loose and quite meaningless talk in the public press and elsewhere of mass prduction in education . There is no more mass production in a school of a thousand pupils with thirty teachers than in a school of thirty pupils and one teacher . Fortunately , Columbia University in its every part so addresses itself to its task as to make mass production in education an impossibility . " The scientific method is everywhere extolled and within certain limits is rigorously applied . Yet the public mind , reinforced each year by a veritable army of youth which is marched through scientific laboratories and lecture rooms , museums and observatories , is as untouched by scientific method as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when out of sight of their own laboratories , betray the most astounding willingness to become the victims of rumors , dogmatic assertions and emotional appeals of every sort . " The fact of the matter would seem to be that scientific training and scientific method , despite all the time and labor and money that have been lavished upon them , have taus far failed to take hold of the minds and temperaments of vast numbers of those who have been offered scientific training in greater or lesser part . " Part of the difficulty may be found - in the fact that science has been suffering from what may be described as a superiority complex which has prevented it from realizing its true place in the scheme of things . As was indicated in an earlier annual report , no small part of the influence which caused the decline and fall of the ancient classics as a chief instrument of education was contributed by the unhappy methods of iristructicn pursued by the classical teachers themselves . If now science is to be sentenced to a similar fate , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the next generation will be sentenced to the very poor and pretentious substitute of vocational instruction . " Business School Defended . Referring to the criticism of the establishment of a school of business at Columbia , Dr. Butler says : I " To be shut up alone with the gain-seeking instinct and habit during the whole of an active life is the most dreadful punishment that can be visited on mortal man . It is the more dreadful because the suffeeer is ausually so blissfully unconscious that he has lost anything . Happily , times ! are changing and men are changing with them . Business , in order to be succeesfull , must now , have the sup ' port of public opinion and popular approval . ' Society has it in its power gravely to limit or even to crush any business organization or activity of which it does not approve or which it regards as harmful to itself . In instinctive recognition of this fact , business is coming pretty much everywhere and in almost all its forms to set before itself a new ideal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the university has its ideal of scholarship and service . " This is a change of mood . of temper and of outlook of literally stupendous significance for the democratic state . No plan of insurance that the wit of man could eossibly devise can equal this union of gain and service in a common ideal as protection for an industrial , economic and financial system which unites in one unit of cooperation the energies of those who work with their hands , of those who work with their brains and of those who work with their savings . This new business ideal , gain and service , invites and even compels a higher standard of preparation , a broader knowledge as foundation and a larger intellectual outlook as driving power . " In other words there is coming to ? be a philosophy of business as there has long been a philosophy of theology , of law , of medicine and of teaching and it is through the door ' of that philosophy , that understanding of fundamental principles and higher standards , that the univer , sity will seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable and competent pursuit of this form of intellectual activity and public service . New Business Type Trained . " The old-fashioned so-called practical man who worked by rule of thumb and was proud of his ignorance is passing . His place is being taken by a higher , a better trained and a more public-spirited type . To promote this change and to assist it is one of the glad functions of the university . " Of athletics at Columbia Dr. Butler says they " are fostered and favored and yet kept in their proper place and not permitted to disorganize the life and study of the college students . " Commenting on the thirty years of Teachers ' College he pays a tribute to the work of Dr. James E. Russell , who retired as Dean last year . Among the significant happenings at Columbia Dr. Butler lists the completion of the Casa Italiana , or Italian House , as a centre of Italian culture , the visit of Queen Marie of Rumania , whom Dr. Butler describes as the " first of the lineal descendants of that monarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was granted . " and the visit of the Lord Bishop of London . Dr. Butler says that the budget for the year ending June 30 , 1927 , showed an estimated deficit in general income of $338,911.32 , which was reduced by operations of the year to $142,229.76 . He lists the appropriations for the year as follows : Education administration and instruction Building and ggrounder ? Library .. I ) .213 Business administration 199.532.001 Annuities .5,557.50 , Ta:ces and other charges on Louliat property ? 0i3O47.n0 Interest on corporate debt 312.2 M.7.0 Payment on Redemption Fund 100.099.00 Amortization of 1925 loan 95,000.00 Total $5,016,454.00 Dr. Butler lists the university 's income as follows : income of the corporation $G , 221,28189 Income from special endowments 1,094,493.05 Gifts 325,933.52 Paid by Carnegie Foundation. ? 193.8170.00 Paid by Presbyterian ** ' I Paid iv Barnard College 559.728.001 Paid by Teachers College 620,220.001 Paid by Vanderbilt Clinic 3,800.00 ?

" The amount of estimated general income with which to meet these charges was $5,781,279.53 , thereby showing an estimated deficit in the cost of the work of the year ending June , 30. 1928 , of $446,006.36 . The fact must again be recorded that the estimated ' deficit was kept even at this very large - sixth- en/IV by declining to make appropriations urgently asked for and really all but necessary to the effective carrying forward of the university 's work . While the operations of the year 1927-28 may , and doubtless will , result in reducing amount of this ' estimated deficiency , it is too much to hope that the year will end without a deficit of considerable size .
