Officers of McCook Field , Dayton , forgot their triumph in adding endurance to their list of speed , climb and altitude records , on seeing the fatal crash of a heavily loaded Martin bomber . Their guests of a few weeks , Captain W. B. Lawson and Sergeant Bidwell , of Langley Field , Va. , Sergeant W. H. Rowland , of Selfridge Field , Mich. , and Hugh M. Smith , of the Bureau of Standards , left McCook on a flight to Langley . In the face of a head wind , Captain Lawson-a distinguished war pilot- could not clear a bridge across the Miami at the edge of the field , and a sharp turn , though well advised under the circumstances , resulted in an almost vertical nose-dive into the river with the instantaneous death of these four men and serious injury to a fifth .
