txt LETTERS TO THE EDITOR ON SUBJECTS OF TIMELY INTEREST " GOLD STANDARD " Gold Standard Does Not Exist , but Should Be Created New York , March 19 , 1922 . TO-the - Editor of The New York Times : In the current discussions of economic conditions much argument has been going on as to the desirability of changing from or retaining the gold " standard " of value . In all these discussion 's there seems to be a general assumptiOn that there is such a thing as a gold " standard . " Furthermore , it seems to be generally agreed that the nearly universal acceptance by the nations of the world of this " standard " and the simplicity ( ? ) of this ' ? standard " are among the main arguments in favor of Its retention . Yet , queer to say , no one ; of its defenders tells us what this " standard " is ! Those who defend it I So ' knowingly and loyally do not distinguish in their remarks and therefore apparently not in their thoughts between ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , ( 2 ) a " standard " amount of . material such as a standard unit weight Of go/d , and ( 3 ) a , " standard " value of material , such as a standard . value ! Cif gold , e. , a standard percentage of the " total changing amount of golcan Which latter effects the varying value I of a standard weight of gold : Thus the commonly used term " gold standard " apparently means merely that gold " is used as the standard - material ( definition 1 ) , for we were all in recent years reminded that there certainly is no uni- I yersally accepted unchanging standard value to a standard weight of gold , such as , for example , a gold coin ( definition 3 ) , nor is there , as is so generally assumed in current discussions , a nearly universally accepted unit of weight of gold used as a standard ( definition 2 ) . This last condition can be readily seen by noting that the American and Canadian dollars weigh 1122 grains of fine gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a , una , so evidently our coins are neither the standard nor do they seem to be even an odd fraction of a unit- standenl . The French franc hi stated to contain 4.48 grains of fine gold . which ie somewhat less than a fiftheof a grain . Apparently , - then , the French basic coin is neither a unit weight nor a multiple or simple fraction of . either a grain or even a grain unit standard ! Then what is this so-called nearly universal international simple gold standard so commonly cussed and discussed . and of all the various systems of weights used by different countries , past and present , upon which it Is based ? Therefore . unless there is such a " standard weight to which the various gold coins of the different presentday nn tons are " simply " related . why not standardize the gold standard ? And If such stanclarclizatien is CVer to be undertaken why is not the present America 's " golden " opportunity ? For it is generally agreed that we ha ve ! reedscorralled here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re coma ble ? gold to afford to continue , keeping it in " dead storage . " Furthermore American metal companies now have burdensome qtfantities of other coinage metals also in expensive " dead storage "  --  the most favorable opportunity for all concerned for making a new coinage on a real international standard , this metal to be returned by the Government to the coma panies from the remelting of the present coinage when redeemed by the new Issue , thereby making the transaction unusually cheap for both the Government and the metal companies . Now as to the " standard . " America should choose the one most acceptable Internationally . which standard , of course , woeld therefore neeessarily be based upon the metric system of weights . Since there are about 25.40 Troy grains ir a. gram , that of itself would suggest that we should adopt as a new international standard coin and a - new internationally used Federal Reserve gold bank note or bill one called 1 Gram ( written " 1 " rather than " One , " because Arabic numere Is are moas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be , and should read to be , redeemable in gold on demand at any Federal Reserve member bank of any of their foreign branches cr correspondents . The gold gram coin or bank note would thus be worth in any country almost exactly 10 per cent . more than the American or Canadian gold dollar- ( or bill ) . The new silver , nickel and copper coins and the new " silver bill , " htswever , since they are token coins and bills , would not need to be altered in character . except changing . the name dollar to gram . merely new designs issued to distinguish them until they are all exchanged for the present-ones , the new dimes , for example , being worth 10 new cents , or almost 11 of the cents now in use . As for the slight disadvantage of the temporary confusion of substitution of new coinage and bills for old , as , for example , here in America , this could be done by non-interest bearing loans by banks to business houses to be repayable in old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time after the legal date of change . Meanwhile others could get . the necessary amount of spending money exchanged at the banks , ? lain the case of checking ac , counts the banks would- take care of the necessary bookkeeping onthe sub , sequent statements . One might object further , to the change in coinage with the'argument that ft would make prices , including carfare- for example , slightly more expensive . By law store prices and contract prices would be adjusted at the legal rate , but in the case of carfares , where adjustment would be impossible , the taxes of the companies could be increased by 10 per cent . of their earnings , which should be --  ? refleeted in the reduction of other taxes . We would be so pleased with the resulting advantages of the change that we would n't begrudge the slight advantage to the proletarian bellhop , bootblack. newsboy , ace or even to the Post Offfice Department and the movies . if they would use it to improve their services . Even the pennies put in church collections would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum wage ! On the other hand . what would be some of the more fundamental advantages of America immediately adopting and putting into use the simple unit standard gold gram coin ? First , it should be a welcome common terra firma for the world , made seasick by the violent waves and troughs of international and national finance . Second , it would be a clarifying . sun , driving away the mirage haven sought by trade unions and most Socialists . Third , it Would be a balance wheel for our American business engine . Fourth , ultimately it would be an acceleration for foreign sales of American products , because it would make it possible for us to deliver the goods . " Fifth , last but not least . it would be a refuge for bewildered Congressmen just before election . First , as to the advantages of America immediately adopting and using a simple unit standard gold gram coin and banknote that would be inherently acceptable , both in international - trade as international legal tender , and also as a return anchorage for present inflated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing to a foreign Hystem of weights for an internationally ? acceptable standard gold coin other nations could hardly raise the objection to following suit that they would thereby be Americanizing their coinage , for they would not be , but would be " internationalizing it . With this desirable factor in its favor as a starting point , America ? although out of the Genoa conference ? might wonderfully help in the reconstruction of Europe by pressing the international adoption of ? this gold gram as an international standard coin , doing ' so either through a subsequent international economic conference or through the new Allied Debt Refunding Commission . In this way we might conclude an international economic reconstruction treaty wherein all treaty nations should agree that , in the near future in Again putting their currency on a sound - basis , they would in common adopt an international standard gold gram coin and banknote and use them as the basis for similar convenient multiple coins and notes , it being agreed to name them thus and to stamp or engrave them with only the , national seal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upon the other side , except for a noncounterfeitable design on the gold banknotes , only the word gram or grams preceded by Arabic figures representing the amount each nation further agreeing possibly not to remelt and recoin standard gold coins or multiples of them of other nations entering their borders , but to at least accept them , and also standard gold gram and multiple gold gram banknotes , as legal tender at par . Token coins and token banknotes should also be universally decimal , but only acceptable as legal tender within the particular nation . Only upon the acceptance of such an agreement should American excess " dead storage " gold be loaned to any European nation . Such gold loans should be made in American gold gram coins or banknotes unless otherwise stipulated . Then at last the world would have the gold standard now so . commonly assumed to exist . Recalling how , before the European war , members of a. certain uncivilized ( foreign ) people once asked me to give them for their national gold and token coinage preferably American . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposit in their ? sand savings* banks . " I venture to predict that such international standard gold coinage would bring ultimately from all parts of the world to the various national mints. for recoinage much hoarded ancient and present day gold coinage . Such internationally standardized gold gram coins would greatly simplify international finance , and through it in- ternational trade , . resulting in other na-. tions now having complex gold standards , and also those with silver standards , probably soon changing over into this real gold standard . This result would make it unnecessary to change gold oains and gold banknotes at international beundaries , because the question intanealaonal exchange rates would thereby become a thing of the past , since inflation wouldthen be merely a national , not an international , problem , because of its affecting only token coins and token banknotes or bills . Therefore gold coins and bank notes would be demanded as change in foreign countries by persons not nationals , and when it could not be obtained business intercourse in that country with foreigners would automatically cease , except upon individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such times of shaken confidence . While America was making such ' a change of coinage , since the Federal Reserve ratio would be best expressed as the actual gold reserve value in cents behind silver grams and gram notes , we might do well to take-the opportunity to change our motto on our . token coinage from " In God we trust " to the more up-to-date one , " In the Federal Reserve Board we trust " ! Second , as to the advantages of the adoption of such a coinage in clarifying the thinking of trade unionists and most Socialists . As a result of the different countries at last having an international , ? g-old standard . American and other radicals could compare their gold gram , wages and salaries with those earned far similar work in other countries . The ern ' ploy:is could thereby more readily grasp their employers ' problems in trying to I Produce goods to compete with foreignmade goods in foreign markets . The I more conciliatory attitude resulting would put the employes and employers , in a more co-operative attitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results desired by each . Certainly , strikes . soap boxes . Seca would then become less popular and the misinformed ' radical would see that there are good reasons for being proud of American citizenship . , Farmers also could then compare their international gold produce prices with the international gold prices elsewhere in the world and thus better understand how national prices depend I upon international competitive conditions . Furthermore , they could more readily understand trade union wages abroad and compare them for similar trades here in the States , with the result that the appeal to them of trades unions for combined action would fall on ' deaf ears . For why should the farmer aid tae " skilled " railroad engineer , for example , to continue his profiteering upon the farmer , when all his " skill " consits in his ability to require some one else to make all repairs on his engine , leaving him merely to " skillfully " steer it on rails that are so switched that they do the steering themselves , whereas the farmer has to have greater skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tractor engine , a mere detail of farming ? Then , with this international , less-fluctuating standard gold gram as a basis , and with comparisons of conditions in different countries made that much simpler , it would make it very much easier for the workmen in the various countries to work out a similar barter ratio for personal services ; for example , the wheat , corn and cotton farmers and the cattle men and sheep men could settle the value of personal services in producing raw materials with that of producing manufactured materials , with the unionized flour , cotton and wool mill operatives , tanners and meat packers . Then the citizen-farmer or rancher-capitalist would see that the ' unionized proletariat , including many foreigners expecting to . return to their , Ifatherlands to spend their savings , were I planning to have them pull their chestnuts out of the fire . Grasping better the economic and resulting social conditions abroad . American citizens would be less prone to stand for advice from foreign radicals or strikes voted by foreigners as members of American trade unioes , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social evolution ( not revolution ) , brought about by learnings determined by personal effici ( mcy and industry . Third . as to the advantages of such an international standard gold gram coin to act as a balance wheel for our American business engine . Because of the increase in knowledge of the relative economic and resulting social conditions abroad among- our competitors , as explained above , strikes would be fewer , with the result that all parts of our great agricultural , industrial and commercial machine would run more regularly , . and thus produce more evenly , and with less upsetting of Prices . ' Furthermore , there would be a corresponding decrease in economic are : social agitation with the result that we might be able occasionally to get our minds off of strikes , politics , and so forth . e.nd onto our work . with a corresponding increase in efficiency . Thus . not only uniformity in production might be increa.sed , but both quantity and quality as well . All of these things would help in foreign competition and thus would of themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to the advantages of the adoption ' of such an international standard gold gram coin in ultimately accelerating or Increasing our foreign sales . As we haVe just seen , such a coin would indirectly help us in foreign competition , and . thus would help us to " deliver the goods , " instead- of having them ordered elsewhere . But once a universal gold gram standard coin and Multiples and decimal fractions of it were actually in use in America . a great psychological victory would have been attained as a , working basis for further standardization and simplification . For example , the practice ) idealists among the metric enthusiasts , including the National Academy of Science . by waiting until the American people hats become thoroughly acquainted with  --  the metric . system of weights as typified in coinage , by not asking all or nothing might induce Congress to adopt the metric system of weights ( not measures ? neither linear or volumetric ) for general use . thereby substituting one simple standard system used ' extensively by foreign countries . for the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Troy and avoirdupois , the latter with two tons ! The rest of the metric system would shortly after be adopted on its own merits . Although this is not essential to the main problem under dis ? cussion , nevertheless it is apropos to show that that problem is but the first of several necessary steps in international . standardization . Once America has adopted the metric system we would be able to " deliver the goods " abroa.d because we could fill foreign orders for goods measured in kilos , liters and meters , which are as confusing to us now as our measures are to them . Therefore such foreign orders are now apt to be placed elsewhere . Fifth , last but not least , as to the adva.ntages a the international adoption of a standard gold gram coin and related currency as a refuge for bewildered Congressmen now that re-election Is the all-Important issue . ' Think of how beautifully the tariff could be further delayed with due regard to the opinions of all factions , claiming that it was necessary to wait for foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , best of all , Congress would have a counter-irritant for the bonus ! Think a the speeches- that could be made " back home " telling how they had n't been able to get to the bonus because of the deep study and great amount of work ) necessary to pass the greatest bill in history , following similar but unsuccessful . attempts by previous Congresses , namely , by " law they had made a dime worth 11 - cents and all other coins and bills raised in value proportionately ! Furthermore , they could tell how unemployment should thereby be decreased or at least " alleviated , many of us getting- employment in , the mints and banks ! Ana think of the proletarian . bootblacks ' , ? bellhops ' and newsboys ' votes ! We would have the greatest landslide in history ! Since the above thoughts have been going through my mind I came upon the following quotation in an article published by one of our greatest international banks in defense of the gold " standard . " also claiming ' for it the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common standard ? of value was toward making the world one communtty In finance , in industry and in trade . It was harmonious - with the influence of improved methods of communication . and transportation , - a common ' language , and common weights and measures . " Reading that spurred me to write my thoughts . Widiald that the thoroughly self-praised American business men would act with results on matters very practical ! America 's golden opportunity is now B. C. UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM New York , Feb. 16. 1922. - To the Editor of The New York Times : The great war , with its heavy demand for labor at undreamed of prices , brought to this city from outlying sections and smaller cities a mass a people who had never lived here before , and the increased supply of money earned by them , conserved by the closing of the saloon , incited them to a mode of living and to the indulgence in luxuries theretofore unknown .

Utilize to the limit all transportatibn facilities now existing . Increase the cost of transportation on the subway , elevated and surface lines , and with it compel the corporations to run sufficient cars to accommodate every passenger with a seat and to stop all crowding .

INDUSTRIAL ARTS Suggests How Art Schools May Co-operate With manufacturers Rutherford , N. J. Feb. 27 , 1922 . To the Editor of The New York Times : With great interest I have . read the editorial on Industrial Art , as well as the letter by John Cotton Dana and , Mr. Harris of the Art Centre . May I , as an American artist , give my opinion in the matter ? I am a free-lance designer and a graduate of one of our best art schools . where I learned those principles which , later . through experience , I applied in a practical way to various manufactured articles . Some few years ago , as a tail-end of World War patriotism , there was a strong drive for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his letter of Feb. 5. clearly explained the reason for this , as well as its quick death and the resultant stranding of the artists , who had been encouraged to adapt their work for the- patronizing industries . Some , who stubbornly refuse to let a " dead dog ' be dead , " are received with an attitude that can best be described by the expression , " and how do you get that way ? " - Business is business ! Since it is cheaper to get designs abroad , American designers are forced to be reconciled and look about for other means of expressin ? their talent . We are tc/d we are technically unfit to design and for that reason designs got abroad are more suitable . Art schools here give students a knowledge of art , of art for art 's sake , prin-I ciples . The time of training is short and in that time it is possible to teach only what is taught now  --  art . During the demand for American- deign , graduates of these schools , through their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the praise . Some of us longed for further technical knowledge . Those books that were to be had were so technical and intricate that they meant nothing to the artist . To see the actual process through which their design went  --  that was their wish . And that was denied them . There was no effort made on the part of any industry to enlighten the artist , and the impression was that the cooperation was quite satisfactory . Mr. Harris , in his letter yesterday , says that we need more practical education in order to train designers . This is true , for an artist needs technical knowledge  --  a knowledge of processes besides her art . In fact , many industries can far better do without art than they can without processes . ? We see that every day . Art is an ' after-thought in manufacture ; it IThly make an article a " seller , " but first of all the goods must be a utility . The happy combination of the two  --  industrial art  --  that Is the goal . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City a textile school has-been started in West Thirtieth Street . Here art and industry both are taught . This is a big step forward ; but even if the courses fitted ' the needs of the artists , this is but one industry , and how could one school do all the training ? Can any school , no matter how well equipped , teach as practically as actual experience ? I cite as an example our cooking schools . Even if this textile school trained its students to become designers they would still have to learn the routine of whatever industry they chose . Why waste this time ? Would not the following plan be feasible , easily adopted , cheap in practice . applicable at once and Of benefit to all concerned ? Let our art schools teach , - as they are teaching , the principles of art in their highest development . But let them co-operate with manufacturers . Instead of c6nsidering students education complete when the art side of their training has been finished and of then granting them a diploma , the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , representing various industries , should agree to take Into their factories , for a. specified length of time , those students who have satisfactorily completed their art- training and give them the technical training necessary to make them useful designers . By training , I do not mean to carry it on as classes , but to put these artists to work at those things that they must master to be proficient and to let them see those processes they must know of , that they can judge of the limitation and the possibilities of the industry . No ' Sc'hool can be as well equipped as a factory ... No matter how well technicalities are taught in a classroom , there is always a certain amount of theory with it that is impractical in practice . A classroom is a classroom and can never teach students that to earn one 's living one must " deliver the goods . " Working right in the industry , students will realize what It means , what quantity production is , how machines interpret designs ; in short , see the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain nominal sum and so be made to Realize that they too must deliver a certain amount of service and are not there just on a /ark . After such experiences In various factories , students would have a clear idea of what industrial art- mea.ns and have sufficient knowledge to design intelligently . The benefit to them is obvious . On graduating . they would be fit to go into many industries practically as experienced workers . Their diplomas would mean something . Nowadays any one with sufficient nerve , a little natural taste and a few drawing lessons puts himself out as artist in any field . A designer 's di ? ploma would mean definite training , just as does a doctor 's or an engineer 's . Firms employing a designer would , for their own sake , take only those who had their diplomas . Nor is the benefit all to the artist . The manufacturer would have the opportunity of picking the best talent from among that in his training . Though the students would not be full-fledged designers , undoubtedly many of them would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new idea might be enough to pay the manufacturer for training artists for a year . Above all , it would develop a competent class of designers , competent from the manufacturer 's , as well as the art school 's point of view , and that is what the industry wishes , is it not ? o tit ? ? That is the question . Today artists aalc , " What is the use if I spend further time and train myself technically ? What will it gain me ? Will the manufacturer give me a chance ? Can he not buy cheaper elsewhere and simply throw the blame on our inefficiency ? In short , what is the use ? De we , after all , put the dollar above even national pride ? Shall we a world power  --  the world power  --  draw out art from abroad and ignore those , who but ask a fighting chance ? That is the question  --  will the industry co-operate ? My plan would be a much quicker way of finding out , than by organizing schools , training students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are sincere in their desire for American designers . let them co-operate . My plan may ' sound impractical to them for reasons best known to themselves. ; it is a suggestion . In Europe , France especially , designers serve an apprenticeship in which they learn the processes for which they design and so can work intelligently . - Shall we be so set upon immediatagain. to fail to give to our artists those privileges that those abroad - enjoy ? Business is business ! There can be no sentiment about it . By teaching artists , according to my plan . some might claim that opportunity is thus given for ' prying into secrets . That is foolish ; ' we want to learn the basis of the industry and not the specialties and tricks that each firm might put great stock in . Experience is the best teacher . For my further proof , I cite the following case . During the war various mechanical engineers , graduates of our best institutes . experienced men , entered naval Schools for steam engineering . Here after drills and routine had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were given practical experience . They were sent into factories to observe , put into the enginerooms of tugs . then ferryboats and ocean liners . When through with their course the men declared they had learned more In the few months at ' actual work than in a few years at college . More examples could be cited . but I am confident that the industries themselves are convinced that they could train the artists better technically than could any school . There is no time like the present . My plan calls , for no money appropriations nor the building and equipping of schools . nor the searching for instructors ; It merely calls for a cooperation that can be had as well today as tomorrow . Shall we have our chance ? Shall we be given the opportunity to work together with industry toward an American art ?

Romay , noting a few of the out:standing characteristics of what is in reality our first and main line of advance and relationship with the peoples of Latin America , advertising . We do not know Mr. Romay , but we do ask that you allow us to say . to your readers that Mr. Romay does know whereof he writes and he knows it well . The people , the prestige and the commerce of the United States of America would gain by millions if that letter Were reprinted and circulated to reach every business man who has or contemplates foreign trade , and if he read it every time he thought of outside business . For it applies to the whole world as well as Latin America . Everywhere we ? both he who stays and he who goes into the front lines  --  suffer immeasurably froth this cheap link at this vitally important point in our chain of foreign relations , this saving of pennies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both commercial and social , between the peoples of the United States of America and those of other countries . But we wish to amplify Mr. Romay 's declarations in one particular . Among our immediate associates ? Spanish , Chileans , Peruvians , Mexicans and Central Americans ? the ignorant Latin American 's translation does not cause the amount of sport by its ludicrousness as do the silly essays of the United States youngster , translating an English advertisement meant to appeal to North Americans ? Anglo-Saxons  --  into high school Spanish . As an example from the multitude : Consider a person who is as familiar with the vileness of wild-boar meat as I most of us are , being adjured to partake I of " Beans with the meat of ' the Boar " in an advertisement placed by some one for New York State 's best-known packing company in the latest issue of an I American magazine published for circulation in Latin America . And especially Is this noticeable when you know that the proper term here also consists of only three words , is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Beans , " is to you , and is fax more apt as a literal description than - your term . Efowever , we are not disagreeing with the assertion regarding the deliciousness of the Spanish-American clerk 's translation of English advertisements . Witness an instance called to our attention by a prominent newspaper man of this city where , in some carriage coMpany literature , ' a buggy was ; recommended as a carriage , " Illepa con chinches " ( carriage full with bugs ) . Yet this comes not so much fromethe lack of specific knowledge in the United States business man as from the cupidity of his salvisers , who are perfectly willing that he should take a ' chance on the fruitfulness of his efforts rather than that - they should , certainly lose the amount it would cost to get the work handled properly .

Imagine it ! We are given to understand that clerks can be had for $20 a week who can handle these matters and - attend to all details . And the newspapers , magazines , billboards , catalogues and business letters show everywhere the effusions of these experts wasting the good money of their employers and , incidentally , losing for us the respect ? we should and must have to do business with these people or live by them in amity . Do you suppose that the German or the Englishman or the Frenchman translates his home literature and communications with a dictionary and sends them here by mail ? If you do , come here and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . Even the Spaniard . Even he makes not the least gesture at such an effort . He comes , he asks the man who has had the opportunity to know , or he sends to his fellow-citizen here on the spot for what he wants or what he wants done . Perhaps Mr. Roma.y thought it unnecessary to explain the vast differences between the everyday words of the various countries . And everybody knows that if we do business or get along as friends we talk and write to others in their common words and not with the involved phraseology of the college professor . Let me illustrate : You want to sell canned turkey . You tell the Mexican about this fine " pavo " and so label the cans . But it does n't mean anything to him , for his word for it is " guacatote . " And he reads the rest of your letter or literature with a smile . wondering what possessed you to call a guacalote " pavo . " In his mind . If you do not know how to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good evidence that you do not know them well enough ' to manufacture what they will like and buy in any case . Oysters are " ostiones " in Mexico and " ostias " in Chile . Nobody is " nadie In Spain and " naidie " in the Argentine Republic . " Chile " ( as a pepper ) is Mexican only . In parts of North Mexico a plow is not an " arado , " but the word used as a trade-mark by an American plow company that did some good advertising there . And here the Spanish phrase for baking powder is likely to get you only a foolish grin , as the trademark word of a certain company is used . AMERICAN-ADVERTISING ASSOCIATION OF MEXICO . L. B. FOSTER . General Manager . PRAYER FOR LANDLORDS Montreal , Canada , March 6 , 1922 . To the Editor of The New York Times : In these days when our cities are being overcrowded at the expense of , the towns , villages and farms , and especially at this season , when , because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are looking forward to May 1 as a clay a great hardship and , in many cases , a day of black despair  --  one could wish that the landlords in every great city might " read , mark . learn and inwardly digest " the remarkable " Prayer for Landlords " given below and , so to speak , answer that prayer themselves . The prayer in question was included In the " Primer : or Book of Private Prayer , needful to be used of all Christians . Authorized and set forth by order of King Edward VI . " ( in 1558 ) ? such is the quaint title of the original . The prayer itself is smong " Sundry Godly Prayers for Divers Purposes , " and may be found on Page 458 of the " Liturgies of King Edward VI. , " published by the Parker Society . " A Prayer for Landlords . " " The earth is Thine . 0 Lord , and all that is contained therein ; notwithstanding Thou hast given the possession thereof unto the children of men , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vale of misery . " We heartily pray Thee to send Thy Holy Spirit into the hearts of them that possess the grounds , pastures and dwelling places of the earth , that they , remembering themselves to be Thy tenants , may not rack and stretch out the rents of their houses and lands , nor yet take unreasonable fines and incomes , after the manner of covetous worldlings , but may so let them out to others that the inhabitants thereof may both be able to pay the rents and also honestly to live , to nourish their families and to relieve the poor . " Give them grace also to consider that they are but strangers and pilgrims In this world , having here no dwelling place , but seeking one to come ; that they , remembering the short continuance of their life , may be content with that that is sufficient , and not join house to house ; nor couple land to land , to the Impoverishment of others , but may so behave themselves in letting out their tenements , lands and pastures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everlasting dwelling-places : through Jesus Chalet our Lord . Amen . " What a poignant " Prayer for the Times " , in which we now live ! With certain commodities , such as the luxuries one can do without , it may be ' proper , in accordance with the law of supply and demand , " for a , nowner or vendor to charge as much as he can get . But , in the case of the necessities of life , that law ought surely to be modified by another standard , namely , " What is a reasonable and fair return on one 's investment ? " Land and houses are limited commodities , and a roof over one 's head is a fundamental necessity . In these days of overcrowded cities and the shortage Of houses , if a landlord were to force the rent up to the maximum of what can be squeezed out of a tenant  --  far beyond the amount necessary to cover taxes . Insurance , repairs and deterioration , and to leave a reasonable net income on the landlord 's investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that demand for " social justice " which . more and more , is coining to be one of the standards of that new ? civilization for which the patriotic citizens of every free country are now working . The landlord class le ' mall in numbers ; and in these &Lyn; of universal suffrage , unlesp , ths landlords . themselves are wise and farsighted enough to answer that " Prayer for Landlords , " tise time ' will soon come when a " government of the people , by the people and for the people " will- be forced by the Votes of the lortfittfering masses to enact stern lawsalor dealing with latch landlords as arafitapacious . In the Englan4 of the sixteenth century the official sympathies of the 131stablished Church were strongly indined to the side of tine squirearchy and the landed gentry , and at that pericid the official attitude of the Church , generally speaking , was to admonish tenants to be gratefully content with the conditions of their life . It is , therefore . all the more noteworthy that a prayer that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlords , " instead of - being one fo'r the good of their own souls , should-have been included at that time , by the order of an English King , In even a Book of Private Prayer . Because that ancient and very . human ' " . Prayer for Landlords " is so full of the " social spirit " of modern Christianity , it might Well be inserted in our twentieth ? century liturgies ? at least among those " prayers for private use " that are still " needful to be used of ' all Christian . " To the Editor of The New York Times : I have read with interest the communication from " R. E. , " entitled " Pay Clinics , " in your issue of Feb. 14 . The doctor 's relation to the public health and his economic problem are not quite such simple problems as " R. E. " would have them seem . He suggests that the doctor 's duty is plain : cut off the increased charges caused by the war , remember his high calling , do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from suffering and all will be well and the problem solved . Strange as it may seem , most of these duties have been part . of the doctor 's life for many . years , yet the prablem is not solved . The reason Is that it is a far more intricate and far-reaching subject than appears at first glance . Just think of It , for a moment , of the statement as made , that there are in our city 2,000,000 people in need of near charity . besides those frankly unable to pay anything for care during Illness . It is a stupendous problem and surely requires a most careful analysis of the situation before any solution is offered . I agree with " R. E. " that pay clinics will not solve the problem , for the care of the health of that many people is a large burden . I also agree with him that a readjustment of prices is in order , as it is a fact that during the World War , when every expense relative to the doctor 's office became so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , also those for operation and consultation . Now that the period Of reconstruction is well advanced and things have become more nearly normal , it is imperative that we do our part in aiding this reconstruction , and our charges should be at or as near prewar priees as it is possible to make them , consistent with efficiency and the need e of the patient . The medical profession has always arisen to meet any emergency , and this reconstruction hour will be no exception to the rule . Patients need never suffer in health for lack of medical care if they frankly can not pay the prices of the day , as all doctors are ready to meet them half way and all specialists are also glad to do their part . But if people value the hoarded dollar more than health . that is their privilege . Ten thousand dollars a year gross income for a doctor seems almost a crime In the mind of " R. E. , " as the doctors ' " expenses are comparatively sthall " . ; one room in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The writer is looking to a past in medicine so far gone by that it is a memory , dusty as the books on the doctor 's shelves , of the day of which he writes . Not that we fail to appreciate the services of these good men in medicine who did their duty as they saw it , lived ' their lives , gleaning much by observation and study , and gave us a sound foundation to build upon ; but the doctor of today has a totally different economic problem . He can not " read medicine " with his preceptor , give two years in medical school and start practice . No. he must have a minimum preparatory education , four years ' medical course and at least two years in the hospital . The modern doctor 's office is a carefully planned and equipped suite of aooms with the necessary instruments for accurate diagnosis and ' treatment . In the case of a specialist the equipment is still greater . He must have a nurse and secretary , or the details of his office work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have the services of a pathologist and an X-ray laboratory . He must devote much of his time to hospital work and medical . meetings , to say nothing of the necessary reading , if he wouldd keep abreast of the progress in his science . The day of the " one-room doctor , " where a few textbooks and a pocket case were his outfit , is long gone by . Who would go backto the day of the guess and the If he is a country doctor , he must ba a poly-specialist . His equipment muse be more complete and he must go to some medical centre for post-graduato Study at least once a year . In either city or country he must have an automobile if he le to cover the day 's work . The advance of medical standards has been of great benefit to the public in an improvement of care and lessening of disease . The great error made by the doctor and " R. E. " is that in the statement " $10.000 practice " the important item I of expense is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profit would be small indeed . Even a doctor ' must live while he works and must 145 up something for that day when the shadows lengthen , as there are no pensions for the old doctor , and he has learned to dread an old man 's home . If he would have a comfortable Sid age . youth.st prepare its foundation in his . As before stated , the answer to the very serious question , how to care for ' the health of 2,000,000 people in Newt I York City , is not answered by the coital:a1 lishment of pay clinics by one or more hoepitals , even if headed by well-known I men . who promise the public to do that Which is manifestly impossible . namely , give Individual care to patients , In large numbers , who pay a small fee to the institution . How can a. man wire ) 6 butes add a minimum of 50 to 100 casi daily to his work ? Therefore , ft must be to an awakened medical professicne as a whole , that the public must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good work for those who need their care , and where no glamour of individual greatness will allure . The urge of the people for the impas ? sible In the care of their sick has beer . the origin of the cult and the charlatan , and a boon to the faker . If the medical profession would be worthy of and hold the confidence and faith of the public , it must be ? deeply ' concerned with the honesty and integrity of all of its members and make only such promises , implied as well as specific , that it can live up to , including those about " pay clinics . " Just for a moment let us consider the strength of the medical . force in this city ' and State , and how it is organized to fight disease . In 1806 there were 371 doctors - in New York City . In 1914 the members of the profession of medicine registered to practice were as follows : 14,111 in the State of New York , 7,724 in the Greater City , 6,390 in the remainder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State had 15,213 , the Greater City , 8,769 , the rest of the State 6,444 . These figures show a total increase for . the State in seven ' years of 1,099 , for , the city of 1,015 , the remainder of the . State 54 . The workshop and the training schoot for the doctor is the hospital and dispensary . In the greater city there ars 50 hospitals of over 100 beds and up to the standard of the American College of . Surgeons . In Manhattan there are 37 hospitals of the same standard ; 11 of these are limited to special cases . These provide hospital bed accommodations for 10,500 patients . In judging of the adequacy of the hosPital provision . the large number who come to New York from near and . far must be remembered ? , in any event , it is desperately inadequate both for the profession and the laity . The next natural . question is : Are doctors organized for the purpose of the best use of their per -- sonal equipment for their fight against : disease in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people ? The largest organization in the State is the Medical Society of the State of New York , organized in 1806 , which now has a membership of 8,833 . The county societies in the Greater City have 4,596 members , while New York County Society has 2,791 . There are many other factors to be considered , which , while tremendously important , are beyond the scope of this letter  --  medical colleges , dispensaries , the Board of Health , medical societies , foundations . Sm. rt has long been my conviction that If the splendid power for good of the whole profession in this city is ever to be unified in such a form as to make it a real power in solving the problem of the care of the sick and the prevention of disease , it must come through some such organization as the Medical Society of the County of New York . Why not this very society , with its large membership and its long record ( 128 years ) of splendid achievement ? Is it too far a vision to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better health of the people and against disease , the cult , the quack and the charlatan , with ample provision for hospital treatment in standard institutions ; when every regular doctor in good standing will be connected with some institution to enable him to bring his work to the highest standard Possible , both in his private and hospital work . and when each will contribute to the sum total of medical knowledge . when the care of the patient will be a matter of record , and where methods and results can be studied on a larger scale than ever before ; when hospitals will be for the benefit of the public and the whole profession , and the day of Individual greatness has passed , and the day of a great profession has come . The thought looms large for the health of the people of New York and the profession of medicine . JOHN VAN DOREN YOUNG .
