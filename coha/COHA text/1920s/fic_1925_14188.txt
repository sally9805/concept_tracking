THE scene is the combined sitting-room and bedroom of the JERNIGAN house , with a fireplace to the left , a sewing-machine to the right and a table in the center of the room . The floor is carpeted with bright straw matting , and everything bristles with tidy primness . A door is at the center back and one at the left rear . The window at the right center , neatly curtained , shows a streak of sombre autumn fields filling up with the blue dusk of a fading winter day . From another part of the house the voice of a woman can be heard shrilly singing " Rescue the Perishing , care for the dying . " The elder JERNIGAN , walking with a stick , comes carefully in at the rear door shivering with cold and carrying a mug-cup in his hand . Below a mass of white hair his face shines out like a ruddy autumn apple , and his whole person suggests the toughness and durability of a dried hickory root . Half-way across the room he stops and listens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perishing , care for the dying ! " He moves over to the fire and sets his mug to warm ; after which he takes a bottle from the mantel , pours out some medicine in a spoon and swallows it . He sits down and stretches his hands to the blaze with a grunt of satisfaction . In a moment he feels the cup and takes a long drink . The woman 's voice calls from off the right. p. 3 VOICE Father ! HENRY Starting . Ah-hanh ! What is it ? VOICE Nearer . Father  --  fath  --  er ! HENRY Moving towards the door at the left . What is it , Mattie ? VOICE Supper 's ' bout ready . Where 's Henry ? The singing begins again , fading towards the kitchen . HENRY Calling futilely after her . He 's feeding up and 'll be here in a minnit . He listens awhile and then reseats himself thoughtfully before the fire . Presently there is a heavy scraping of feet on the steps outside and HENRY JERNIGAN comes timidly in at the rear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hesitating and shy . He takes his seat silently and wearily in a rocking chair , being careful not to touch the whitewashed hearth with his feet . The old man looks at him closely . HENRY Tired out , ai n't you ? Hyuh , try some o ' this ' simmon beer , I jest dreaned the barrel . HENRY In a slow , fumbling voice . I do n't want none o ' that , I believe . HENRY Unh-hunh . They both lapse into silence , staring before them . Soon the elder JERNIGAN peers through the window at the winter sunset . Gon na be cold , Henry , cold . Robins been flying towards the south all day . HENRY says nothing . You 're tireder'n common , ai n't you , Henry ? p. 4 HENRY Yeh . Lifelessly . Wore out , wore out . HENRY Taking his bottle from the mantel . Hyuh , take this last dost of Doctor ' Manuel 's tonic . HENRY shakes his head . Well , I will then . He pours out the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by today . ' Bout night and he ai n't hyuh yit . You better git him to give you something , ye better , Henry , you 're looking thin , thin . HENRY He ai n't no doctor , he 's a humbug . HENRY Lard help my life ! HENRY Wonder that mess do n't kill you  --  old branch water and chemicals he 's mixed up , I betcha . He sighs heavily , listening to the song in the kitchen . That old man 's crazy with his poetry and talking and medicine ! HENRY Hunh , not hardly . Solemnly . ' Tai n't body tired what ails ye , Henry , is it ? After a moment he jerks his thumb in the direction of the song . Still singing , Henry . There it is . HENRY Yeh , I know . HENRY Ah-hah , but folks will marry jest the same . She 's worse'n ever , Henry . Good she is , religious good . Cooking and sewing and scrubbing and all fixed up fer tonight . Look over there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there Hindoos or whatever they are . There 's my coat I bought in Dunn five years back at Old Man Ransome Taylor 's sale ! p. 5 HENRY His eyes travelling heavily about the room . What 's she got on fer tonight ? HENRY Another one o ' them there meetings . Old Mis ' Pate and her gang 's coming hyuh to sew fer the heathen and them that 's starving over in the old world . Staring at him intently . This religious mess is gon na kill Mattie off ef you do n't git up manhood enough to stop it . Sing and talk , sing and talk , Lard , I caint stand it no more . HENRY I  --  I cai n't  --  I ai n't gon na put my authority on nobody . She 's her own boss . HENRY Own boss ! She 's her own boss and our'n too . Well , ef you 're scared of her , all right . They ai n't no help fer it . He turns towards the fire , patting his foot forlornly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gitting no fun out'n living , and right now 's the time ye ort.  --  And as fer me  --  I been wanting to talk  --  Hitching up his chair.  --  to you ' bout this . Why the name o ' Old Scratch you do n't up and putt down yer foot I cai n't see . HENRY says nothing . But ye wo n't . Half to himself . He ai n't got no backbone , lets everybody run over him . He reaches for his cup and drains down the last of his beer in an angry gulp . Ye did n't git that from yer mammy ner from me , Henry . He mocks the singing in the kitchen . " Rescue the perishing  --  " p. 6 HENRY Suddenly standing up . I cai n't have no row with nobody , not with her nohow , I tell you . At the door . I got to go part the cow and calf . He slams the door behind him and the old man jumps in astonishment . HENRY Dinged ef he did n't slam the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Henry , good fer you ! MATTIE , a fair faced young woman , comes in from the left , singing and carrying a stone churn in her arms . Despite her housewifely certainty of action , there is an indefinite feminine frailty about her . MATTIE What 's good for Henry ? HENRY Hurrying in confusion to his chair . Nothing , Mattie , nothing at all . She looks sharply at him a moment and then sets the churn by the hearth . MATTIE I 'm putting the milk here to turn . I wisht you 'd look at it every now and then and stir it with the dasher . HENRY All right , Mattie , all right . MATTIE And mind , do n't you spill none o ' that old beer on the hearth . HENRY I wo n't , Mattie , I wo n't . MATTIE What 'd Henry go out for ? p. 7 HENRY To git the calf away from the cow . MATTIE The words piling out . I bet he did n't wipe his feet when he come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following HENRY 'S trail . No , he did n't  --  just look at the dirt , just look at it . She hurries into the room at the left and returns with a broomsedge broom . Here , sweep it up , Father . She pushes the broom into his hand . I 've got to go back to my batter . She sticks her head out the door at the rear and calls . Henry  --  Hen  --  ry ! Supper ! She turns back into the room and old JERNIGAN falls to sweeping . Sweep it towards the hearth , towards the hearth , Father , and mind the milk , do n't git it full of dust . She goes out singing , beginning where she left off.  --  " from sin and the grave  --  " HENRY Sweeping . Lard , Lard A'mighty , was ever martel man so persecuted ! Leaning on his broom and musing . There he is  --  Nodding his head to the right.  --  pore soul , not at peace in his own household , going about like a man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worried , worried down to the ground . And there she is  --  Nodding to the left.  --  reading the Christian Herald and hearing about dirt and disease and famine over in Azhy till she ai n't fit to live with . Listen to her , listen to her , will you ? What 's to become of me , Old Moster only knows . What , to come to this , to this in my old age and me  --  Thumping on his chest.  --  yeh , me , old and with a crippled leg from marching in Furginny ! He wipes his sleeve across his eyes and goes back to sweeping . Presently he stops and begins to muse again . Putts me to sweeping , she does , and churning and gitting up the eggs , and following old setting hens around . And she 's had me at the wash-tub like an old woman , she has . Damn it ! His voice sags over the oath . I ai n't no woman . If Henry ai n't got the grit to say something , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that , Father  --  Father  --  Father ! " But ding it all , she 's a good girl . It 's that drot'n old bell-cow of a Bella Pate and her gang what 's got her worse'n she ever has been . I wisht a starm would come up and blow the whole shooting-match of ' em clean to Roosia or wherever it is . Then they 'd git enough o ' them there heathen , I reckon . But they ai n't got no right to interfere with me , not a bit . He puts a hand into his pocket and holds up a small tin box in his left hand and a plug of tobacco in his right . Here they come and set ' pon me about my tobacco . Chew chewing-gum , chewing-gum , they say , to save fer the heathen and to pertect my health . He rattles the tin box . And I 've chewed that wad o ' stuff till I cai n't git rid of it in my sleep . Cai n't wear it out , cai n't by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . Have to slip off and hide to chew my tobacco , and all in a land o ' freedom . He stands thinking , then goes to the door at the left and calls . Mattie , air ye busy ? p. 8 MATTIE Yes , I 've got my hands in the dough ! HENRY All right . He stealthily bites off a chew from his plug , drops his tin box back in his pocket and spits in the fire with grim happiness . Just as he is leaning to spit a second time , the door opens suddenly at the left rear , and MATTIE comes in with a cloth . Old JERNIGAN draws back , and begins sweeping in a flurry of embarrassment . He calls out testily . Thought you was busy . Ai n't I doing all right ? MATTIE Sweep it clean , Father . I forgot this cloth for the churn . She raises the lid from the churn and stirs the contents around with the dasher . It 's all right and ready , lacking just a bit , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while you 're a-churning it . She wraps the cloth around the handle of the dasher . The old man is sweeping and watching her out of the corner of his eye . While she is bent over she sees something on the hearth that attracts her attention . She rises up to her height and with a sharp note in her voice turns upon him . Mr. Jernigan  --  HENRY Nah , nah , Mattie . MATTIE Signs do n't lie , and there 's signs of it there on my hearth . Working around the room and watching him furtively . Right here in my front room ! Ai n't you got your mouth full of tobacco right this minute ? He shakes his head . Yes , you have , yes , you have . She stands looking at him as he sweeps . Father , why do n't you say something , cai n't you talk ? He makes little movements of agony and finally chokes . Yes , yes , you are chewing right now . Spit it out , spit it out ! Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . In desperation he runs to the fireplace and explodes into the fire , and stands coughing with a nauseated look on his face . I 'll get you some water ! She hurries out and reappears immediately with a glass of water and a battered wash-basin full of claying material . Here drink it , and take this pan and rag and clay the hearth over . After drinking the water , he ruefully gets down on his knees and begins work . She goes to the machine . Hurry and get it done , I got supper nearly cooked . She sits down and begins sewing and singing " How firm a foundation  --  " p. 9 HENRY Indicating the garments . Air they fer the heathen ? MATTIE They are that . HENRY Timidly . ' Course you know best , I reckon . But how you know they wear britches over there ? MATTIE Staring at him in amazement . Who ever heard of folks not wearing britches ! You know they 'd put ' em in jail for such , if they did n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there but a string around their waist to tell where the middle is . MATTIE Pedalling furiously . You men do n't care , of course , care ' bout nothing but your farming and your crops . Why , it 's in the Christian Herald where the little children just go through the woods in big droves gnawing the bark off of the trees they 're so hungry . We 've decided to give up our breakfast and send the cost of it to them . HENRY That 's why you did n't eat breakfast this morning . Well  --  you et a whole lot more fer dinner to make up fer it , did n't ye ? MATTIE Sharply and with a nervous note in her voice as she gets suddenly up from the machine . Father , take all this mess out when you get done  --  that old ' simmon beer cup , and that old ' Manuel patent medicine bottle , and do n't forget to carry the clay pan out  --  She goes out at the left . Her song is heard rising in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttering to himself . HENRY comes in at the rear p. 10 HENRY Stretching his legs out carefully towards the fire . What 's the matter with the hearth now ? HENRY Setting the pan in the corner by the wood-box . Nothing , nothing , Henry . She thought she saw a speck on it somewhere . HENRY You must a-been chewing tobacco ag'in . HENRY Well , why should n't I chew it ? HENRY Yeh , yeh , I wisht you could in peace . HENRY You 'd be better off ef you 'd go back to chewing . HENRY I know . But I promised her I 'd quit and I have . HENRY I used to chew it ' fore it quit raining in Africky or wherever it is and ' fore old Bella Pate brung her sanctified self around here , I did , and they was some joy in having a far then , and some reason for having a farplace too . Tapping on the andiron with his stick . That 's what it 's made fer  --  to spet in . HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out with Mattie . Earnestly . I wisht you would . HENRY Durned ef I did n't come purty nigh telling her something a while ago . He catches HENRY by the arm . Now look-a here , Henry , you'n me 's got to do something . The thing for you to do is to walk down the road tonight and meet Mis ' Pate and them folks and tell ' em they cai n't come up here to carry on no prayer-meeting and sewing business . Tell ' em to go som'r 's else . Tell ' em to go to  --  hell ! p. 11 HENRY Shrinking away . I cai n't do that , I cai n't . Lord , you 're near ' bout gone to cussing . HENRY And tell ' em yer wife ai n't gon na have nothing else to do with sich . HENRY Quickly . I tell you what , you do it . HENRY I would in a minnit , Henry , but you 're the head o ' the house and you better , it 's yer place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY Mebbe they wo n't come tonight , and before they meet another time mebbe we can figger on something to do . HENRY Hunh , they 'll be hyuh , all right . HENRY Staring off . I hear they 's mad dogs about . One bit at Dick Ryall 's child this evening . HENRY Studying . Well , that may break up the meeting , but I wo n't believe it till I see it , not me . Take more'n mad dogs to stop religion . You stand up to Mattie , I tell you , putt the britches on and wear ' em yourself . Lard , I cai n't understand you . Why you let her impose on me in my old age the way you do I cai n't see . He turns away and sits down in his arm-chair . MATTIE comes in with a tin bucket in her hand. p. 12 MATTIE I 've got to go across the fields to Mis ' Ragland 's a bit  --  Suddenly stopping . Henry , go right back out that door and wipe off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet . He goes outside and is heard scraping his shoes on the edge of the porch . MATTIE Sweep it up , Father . He gets the broom and sweeps . I got to borrow some soda from Mis ' Ragland and she wanted me to bring her a jar o ' jam . HENRY Coming back into the room . I 'll go over there for you , Mattie . MATTIE No , I 'll go , and you-all go on and git your supper . I 've put the biscuits in the stove , and they 'll be ready by the time you wash and get to the table . Now Henry , do n't let them biscuits burn . She goes out . HENRY Scornfully . Jest look at her  --  did n't have a bit o ' business over there , jest wants to go over see what old Nonie Ragland 's got made up for the heathen . Henry , you got to lay the law down , I tell you . HENRY Yeh , yeh . HENRY Now , I 'm gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dumb brutes , Henry , you got to break ' em ' fore they 'll work . p. 13 HENRY Nah , nah , I cai n't do that . There is a knock on the porch . HENRY Who kin that be ? Happily . That 's my doctor , I betcha . The knock is repeated at the door . HENRY Raising his voice in sudden irritability . Go on away ! Go ' way ! HENRY Staring at him . What  --  Come in , come in ! DOCTOR IMMANUEL comes in . I knowed it was you , Doctor , I knowed it was you . The DOCTOR is a man of medium height , about fifty years old , dressed in a cheap threadbare dark suit , celluloid collar and dark tie . His coat hangs low and nearly to the knees , clerical-like . Despite his cheap dress there is an indefinable air of distinction about him ; something scholarly , something forlorn in his pale clean-cut face and dark piercing eyes . He carries a well-worn medicine case in his hand . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat , disclosing a huge mop of long black hair streaked with gray and resting like a bolster on his neck and shoulders . DOCTOR IMMANUEL In a deep level voice . Masters of this house , friends  --  HENRY Pushing up a chair . Come right in , come right in and make yourself at home . The DOCTOR lays his hat on the bed at the right and puts his case in a chair . He moves in a sort of dream-like , mask-like manner , intent upon his business and paying little attention to the two men. p. 14 DOCTOR IMMANUEL His voice moving in a level chant , half-singing as he opens his case . What can I do for you tonight ? What can I do for you tonight ? He takes out bottle after bottle , shakes it , squints at it towards the light , and replaces it , chanting as he does so . As you all know , wherever I go , My name is Immanuel , I treat you well , I make you well , Sound as the sweet church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in surprise . Now what is it , brother ? What can I do for you ? HENRY Fetching his bottle . Another bottle . I just drunk the last . HENRY Growling . Another bottle of stump water , dishwater , rainwater . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Holding up the bottle . Doctor Immanuel 's Universal Remedy ! Right it is and very fit . Distilled from secret weeds and herbs by mystic processes . Cures internal ailments , cuts , burns , bruises , is an antidote for poisons , can be taken internally or externally . For swelling in the joints , leg sores , sore throat , convulsions , dizziness , fits , and general disorders . The words roll from him in a flood . He turns towards old JERNIGAN , fixes him with his eyes , and suddenly sings out . What is your trouble , brother ? Are you healed , better or  --  It 's cold tonight , cold tonight , and ice on the pools in the lane . p. 15 HENRY In my knee , you remember , in my knee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , doctor , slowly , slowly . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Holding his hand up in assurance . Slowly but surely , certainly , absolutely . Another bottle and you walk straight as any man . As you all know , wherever I go , My name is Immanuel . I always make you well , As any man will tell . His voice drops to a whisper and he hums under his breath , the while he is putting away the empty bottle and getting out another . He hands the bottle to old JERNIGAN . The price is one and a quarter now , brother . Prices have gone up , prices are going up . The demand exceeds the supply . Again he chants . I travel from morning till nightCuring and fixing things right.From night until dayI 'm on a-my way  --  He begins placing his bottles back in his case . Seeking the saddened sight  --  Again he whirls upon the old man . Is the knee all that troubles you ? Have you other troubles , diseases of the body or the soul ? HENRY Shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right saving my knee . p. 16 DOCTOR IMMANUEL Picking up a small bottle and holding it lovingly before him . Now here is a remedy , the remedy , the heart and soul of the matter , the help for the world 's evils . Down in Egypt , the country of darkness , it was discovered . Dug out of the tombs of the powers of evil . Hid away they had it , but my agent discovered it , sent it to me , here it is . Reading . Dr. Immanuel 's Egyptian Tonic . Suddenly barking like an auctioneer , as HENRY jumps in his chair . Two dollars a bottle , two dollars , Going at two dollars.Are you weak and heavy laden , Sore distressed , sad distressed ? It will cleanse of evil passion , Restore you bowels of compassion , Accidents , diseases chronic  --  Shouting . The marvelous Egyptian Tonic . He sticks it out at old JERNIGAN . Two dollars once , two dollars twice  --  Going at two  --  HENRY Backing away from him as he fumbles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this bottle 's enough . Here 's yer dollar and a quarter . The DOCTOR takes the money impersonally . Come up to the fire and warm yourself . p. 17 HENRY Looking at old man JERNIGAN significantly . Anh-hanh , what 'd I tell you ? The DOCTOR closes his case and goes to the bed for his hat . HENRY calls to him bitterly . You better look out down in that creek for mad dogs . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Turning back quickly but with dignity . Mad dogs ? HENRY Yeh , dogs that are mad . Mad dogs . One of ' em bite you and you 'll be madder'n you are now . HENRY Yeh , you git bit and you 'll foam at the mouth and gnaw bedposts and cut up terrible like Sarah Williams done ' fore she died . She run out in the yard and screamed , and they tried to ketch her but she run off and lay down by the hedgerow and died biting her legs and arms and barking like a dog . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Quickly taking a tiny package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for all bites and poisons . Bring it near the afflicted spot and it seizes upon it  --  Clapping it to the top of his hand.  --  and sucks out the poison . Five dollars apiece , five dollars . Gazing at it fondly . This mysterious stone was taken from the belly of a bewitched deer , killed by the old prophet of the Cape Fear . Barking again . Five dollars apiece , five dollars , going at five dollars . He pushes the stone quickly out at old JERNIGAN. p. 18 HENRY Nanh , nanh , I ai n't run mad . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Five dollars  --  Five dollars once , five dollars twice  --  five dollars  --  Suddenly he stops and stares at HENRY as if perceiving something remarkable and strange about him . He mechanically wraps up the stone and drops it back in the case , never taking his eyes from the young man . He moves toward him and walks obliquely around him . Old JERNIGAN watches him with open mouth . As the doctor approached him , HENRY turns and follows him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you up to ? The DOCTOR continues to stalk him . He draws back dramatically and points a sharp finger at HENRY . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Grotesquely . Trouble . HENRY Jumping and giggling nervously . Trouble , hee-hee ! HENRY Staring at him . Trouble ? DOCTOR IMMANUEL His words beginning to pour out in a roll . I see upon that brow suffering . My name is Immanuel . I am needed , needed here and now . Looking at him in anguish . You are weak and heavy laden . Tell me . Speak forth your heart . I am come that ye might have rest from your suffering . Speak forth , thou unbeliever. p. 19 HENRY Hyuh , hyuh , I ai n't gon na have no monkey shines . With a touch of entreaty in his voice . Stop it now . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Shaking his head mournfully . I must help you . I feel the call of pain . Speak forth your heart . HENRY Turning towards old JERNIGAN . What 's he up to nohow ? HENRY Now , now , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the DOCTOR stares fixedly at HENRY . HENRY Looking anxiously about the room and presently bursting out . I tell you to stop looking at me thataway ! DOCTOR IMMANUEL Trouble , trouble , suffering in the countenance of that face ! Imploringly . Speak , speak , I have remedy for suffering . I can help and aid thee . He clasps his hands and waits . HENRY stirs uneasily in his chair and old JERNIGAN teeters nervously on his feet , beating his thighs with the back of his hands . At last old JERNIGAN explodes . HENRY Well , you air in trouble , Henry !  --  In a way ye 're in the deepest sort of trouble . Muttering . Me too , and me too . p. 20 DOCTOR IMMANUEL Triumphantly . Ah  --  hah ! Speak , speak ! HENRY Half in wrath and half in perplexed fear . Well , what'n the name of Old Scratch you want ? DOCTOR IMMANUEL Speak forth the evil that is possessing thee . HENRY Twisting about . You tell him , Pa , if they 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been seeing a right smart o ' worry lately . We was talking about it before you come . DOCTOR IMMANUEL I know , I perceive it . HENRY Going on haltingly . As the scripture putts it , he 's married to a wife . He stops . DOCTOR IMMANUEL One had his land , one had his yoke of oxen , another had his wife and could not come . As set forth in the gospel according to Luke . HENRY Eagerly . That 's it , doctor , his wife 's tuk possession of everything hyuh . HENRY Now , now . HENRY Well , she has . And that there doctor kin help you , I done told you he could . He steps nimbly out into the room and sweeps it with his arms . Look a ' there , will you ? Look at that there h'a'th . Clean as a sheet . And the floor and everything . A speck o ' dirt got no home hyuh and we ai n't nuther . Pointing to the sewing-machine . And look over there at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fer good , all fer the heathen over the water . p. 21 HENRY You mought stop trying to tell everything . HENRY Well , you tell it then . HENRY Go on then and say what you wush . HENRY All right and I will as shore as you 're born . That 's just it , doctor , she 's plumb tuk with religion and sweeping and talking . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Where is the lady of the house ? HENRY Off , off . DOCTOR IMMANUEL A common case , a common case . The man must stand up and be the master . The scripture tells as much . HENRY Jubilantly . There you air , Henry , there you air . Jerking his thumb at HENRY . But he wo n't , he wo n't , not him . He sets lak a wedge in the rain and takes it every bit . Big as a house he is and ai n't got no backbone in him more'n a sack . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Timid ? Afraid ? Lacking in manly courage ? HENRY Wrathfully . Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will provide . He can cure . HENRY You cure ' em both and I 'll pay you . Fix it so 's I kin chew my tobacco in peace and here 's a five dollar bill fer ye . He pulls out his pocketbook. p. 22 DOCTOR IMMANUEL I shall cure them , I must cure them , I will cure them . Amen ! HENRY Do that and this here 's your'n . He flaps a bill in his hands . The DOCTOR begins to pace up and down the room , pushing back his hair and mumbling to himself . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Snapping . When will the lady of this house return ? HENRY She just stepped acrost the field . But you need n't be planning none of your mess , I ai n't gon na take no part in it . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Mess ! Mess ! He resumes his walk . HENRY Becoming excited . I du n no what you gon na do , Doctor , but I jest beccha you do it . Gleefully . I bet he does , Henry . Yeh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner said than done . Whirling upon HENRY . I can cure you both . I can bring peace and order into this distracted home . I can make a man of might out of you . I can make you a mighty man in Israel , both in deed and in word . I can bring back humility and love to the erring woman 's heart . Yea , Lifting up his voice . I can prepare a proper helpmeet for you in your distress . Thundering and glaring . But  --  but  --  have you faith in my powers ? p. 23 HENRY I du n no  --  I du n no  --  Hah , crazy ! HENRY Ecstatically . Try to raise up yer faith , Henry . Grinding his hands in excitement . Hurry up , Henry , hurry up , she 's gon na be back in a minute . HENRY Shaking his head weakly . I 'm scared of all this business . How I know he wo n't kill me or something or hurt her . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Kill ! Hurt ! His jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your words are wild , wild and full of poison to my kindly heart . His tone suddenly changes to anger . Take your own benighted way then . I offer you peace , you choose strife . So be it . JERNIGAN grasps HENRY 's arm in supplication . HENRY Henry , Henry , try it , try it , boy ! DOCTOR IMMANUEL Raising a warning hand . But listen , before I depart over the creek .  --  To himselfA mule there swelled with the colic  --  Behold salvation is at hand and you refuse it . HENRY Air ye crazy , Henry ? There he is now going off . HENRY Beginning to show an unwilling interest under the DOCTOR 's spell . Well ,  --  p. 24 DOCTOR IMMANUEL Picking up his hat . I shall say no more . HENRY Henry , Henry , do n't let him go off like that there ! The DOCTOR picks up his case and moves towards the door . HENRY Well , if you 're shore you wo n't hurt me ner her , I mought  --  DOCTOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodnight and may you endure your punishment as befits a sufferer so blind . He grasps the door knob . HENRY Henry , Henry ! HENRY Are you shore you wo n't hurt me ? DOCTOR IMMANUEL Faith ! Have you faith ? HENRY Standing up with sudden decision . Well , I 'll try it then , by God ! Where 's your medicine ? Bring it on . With an amazingly agile bound the doctor springs back into the room . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Saved ! Saved ! He opens his case and searches in its depths . Extracting two tiny bottles , he holds them up in his hands . HENRY sits down again watching him with open mouth . Ah , here they are , Doctor Immanuel 's Cure for the Unhappy Soul . The one is red , the other gray . The red is for the rich blood of manhood . Drink it and you become masterful , fearless , a tamer of the weaker sex . They will bow down to you , worship you , feed upon your words of wisdom as upon honey-dew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red . He becomes the lord of his house and his goods . She becomes the meek and lowly helpmeet . There she sits by the fire silent , gentle and sweet . There he sits her master , her lord . p. 25 HENRY His eyes shining . Listen at him , Henry , listen at him talk . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Lifting up the red vial . I remember , I remember . I see in the past . It is a night of storm . The moon is sick and pale and wasting in the west . The pale moon doth rain , The red moon doth blow , It bringeth water in its beak.The white moon doth neither rain nor snow . I rise up in my dreams . Doctor Immanuel comes forth from his couch at the midnight hour , for now it is the time to seek for the cure of unhappy souls . Silently I go through the forest towards the appointed place . The rain and the wind they comfort me on my journey . I go forth alone in the forest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky , it is the time of the bull , and the bull means life and more abundant life . He waves his hands before his face and treads up and down the room acting out his journey . HENRY and old JERNIGAN stare at him as if mesmerized . I go by the elder bush in the pathless swamp , I touch the sorrel tree , and place my hand upon the bark of the smooth bay tree . I mount the hill and taste of the sweet sassafras and a bit of the bitter pine , and I , Doctor Immanuel , as the cocks begin to crow , come to the place of the silent old man and he waits for me . He has had his dream . Together we go far to the east , he with six dried sticks of the bloody mulberry and I with six of the nameless bush under our arms . We come where the young strong man died for love and his rich red blood ran into the ground . There we set the pot and build the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves back and forth in the room with the queer unreal steps of a jumping-jack . And into the pot Doctor Immanuel casts his one and two and three . And likewise the silent one casts his one and two and three which shall not be named till time is done . The bottles are brought forth and filled . The silent old one to his home again which none but two can find . And Doctor Immanuel forth into the world to heal the distressed . His voice dies away and he hums to himself. p. 26 HENRY Breaking from the spell . Ai n't he crazy right ? DOCTOR IMMANUEL Picking up the gray vial and throwing up his hand . And hark ! He stands with his hand uplifted , and they wait . It is night , a night of peace . The farmer sleeps his toil away , and the stock rest in the stall . The seeds wait in the earth , in the warm ground . The poor birds sit in the hedgerow and the snake goes not forth to prey . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hanging in the heavens above the three dark pines . Again he falls to striding up and down the floor . Doctor Immanuel is forth from his couch . The signs are right . The virgin walks in the sky . He comes to the three dark pines and waits in prayer . And the three maids of the deep swamp minister unto him , they minister unto him . Out of the darkness they come with song and with dancing , their heads hanging low and their rings shining and their garments flashing silver with the flames of gold . He turns and stares at HENRY who watches him groggily . From the mud of the turtle and the scaly snake they come , rising out of the deep night time , out of the mire and swampy slime , where the owl and the bat and the fever are . They rise , bringing the cure , the gray cure , the draught of humility , of peace . He stares at the gray vial and stands lost in thought . Presently he turns , his voice humming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power ; drink the gray , become the meek and gentle of the earth . Doctor Immanuel has said his say ! He begins walking back and forth across the room , HENRY and old JERNIGAN stare at him as if fascinated . Far off a woman 's voice is heard singing . It draws nearer , and MATTIE passes around the house , singing " Rescue the Perishing , " and goes into the kitchen. p. 27 HENRY Swallowing hard . Hyuh , they 's something quare ! HENRY He 's gon na cure you , Henry . He is ! Sink yer trust in him , Henry ! DOCTOR IMMANUEL Come , drink the drink ! He closes his case and sets the two bottles on top of it . Call the lady of the house . She shall have the gray . HENRY Starting from his dream , sidling up to the bottles , and staring at them suspiciously . Mought be something in it , mought not . A queer unreal smile breaks over his face and he comes up to the doctor and stares at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . Dinged if I do n't ! MATTIE 'S sharp insistent voice is heard in the kitchen . MATTIE Father ! Fathe-er-r ! Henry ! Henr-y ! HENRY Drink it , swallow it down , Henry ! Ca n't be no worse'n He turns and mocks MATTIE . Father ! Henry ! and singing . " Rescue the perishing  --  " Go on , Henry . HENRY picks up the red vial , uncorks it and smells it and sets it down , then takes up the gray one and does likewise . HENRY Why it do n't smell like nothing a-tall. p. 28 DOCTOR IMMANUEL Stopping in his walk and looking at him piercingly . Bid the lady of the house come in . HENRY Throwing his head about and beating himself as if trying to fight off the DOCTOR 'S influence . You call her , Pa . The door flies open at the left and MATTIE springs in with a pan of burnt biscuits in her hands . MATTIE In a shrill nervous voice . Look what you 've done , both of you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at HENRY and HENRY looks at him . HENRY Finally . I thought Henry was looking after them biscuits . HENRY Fumbling . I did n't even think of ' em , Mattie . MATTIE I know , I know . That 's just the way it is . That 's just the way it is . That 's always the way it is . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Madam , lady of this house ! MATTIE Starting back . Oh , I did n't see you , Doctor ' Manuel . Put some wood on the fire , Father . When 'd you come , Doctor ' Manuel ? p. 29 DOCTOR IMMANUEL Madam , when you appeared in the door we were in the midst of a most momentous question . MATTIE What'n the world is all this to-do about ? You 'll have to tell it quick , I 've got to hurry and get supper . We are sewing here tonight  --  With a weary , defiant look towards HENRY and old JERNIGAN.  --  sewing for the heathen . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Madam , after tonight you will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own household . We are solving that momentous question . MATTIE What in the world is all this to-do about , I ask you ? DOCTOR IMMANUEL With high dignity . Madam , behold the two bottles there . The one is red , the other gray . The red is for your husband , the gray for you . MATTIE Need n't think I 'll drink any of your crazy mess . DOCTOR IMMANUEL The husband will drink the red and take charge of his household . You will drink the gray and obey him . in what he says hereafter . MATTIE The Lord help my life ! Turning to HENRYHave you gone out'n your head same as him , to be taking on to such stuff ? HENRY Timidly . Try and drink a little bit , Mattie . It wo n't hurt you ! He says it 's good for you . p. 30 MATTIE The dog 's foot ! HENRY With a hint of determination in his voice . He 's done said if I drink that stuff you wo n't know me for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink it . DOCTOR IMMANUEL He 's going to drink his and you 're going to drink yours . MATTIE That I 'm not . I 've never heard of such . Henry Jernigan , you must be crazy to fool with him . HENRY Yes , I 'm gon na do it . I 'm plumb tired of sich a mess of things . I 'm gon na change it or die a-trying . With a lunge he grabs one of the bottles and throws the contents down his throat . MATTIE Screaming . Henry , it 'll poison you ! Henry stands tasting with his lips . A foolish smile breaks over his face . HENRY Why , it ai n't no more'n  --  The DOCTOR brings his hand down on HENRY 'S shoulder with a whack and stares significantly at him . HENRY 'S eyes gradually narrow in comprehension and he turns and walks back and forth across the room thinking . The DOCTOR moves around as if unconcerned . Suddenly HENRY springs into the air with a yell . Old JERNIGAN starts back and falls over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Running up to HENRY . Henry , Henry , honey , what is it ? HENRY Tearing wildly around the room and shrieking . I 'm pizened , pizened ! Help , water , I 'm afar inside . He doubles over in pain . MATTIE pursues him wringing her hands . All the while the DOCTOR walks ecstatically and yet unconcerned around the room , carrying on his automaton-like actions and his monologue . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Chanting . As you all know , wherever I go , My name is Immanuel . I treat you well , I make you well , As sound as the sweet church bell.Down the road I travel , Going in rain or shine , Healing the sick and afflicted , No medicine like unto mine.This I tell who comes like Immanuel . HENRY Falling into a chair and slobbering heavily at the mouth as he gasps . Pizened ! Pizened ! Help , water ! MATTIE throws her arms around his neck . MATTIE Run , Father , run and bring the bucket of water . The old man shoots into the kitchen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crooning over HENRY and rubbing his face and forehead feverishly . Oh , darling , honey . What can I do ? She breaks into wild sobs. p. 32 HENRY Hyuh , hyuh , drink some water , Henry . HENRY springs out of his chair , knocking MATTIE from him . He souses his head in the bucket and drinks , spits out great mouthfuls of water on the floor and empties the bucket over his head . Then he stamps the bucket to pieces , shrieking and yelling . MATTIE Run for the doctor , run for the doctor ! DOCTOR IMMANUEL I am Doctor Immanuel at your service , madam . MATTIE turns and glares at him a moment and slaps him in the face . HENRY snatches up the broom and begins chasing the doctor around the room and beating him . The doctor makes an effort to get his case and hat as he is pursued , calling out . This is wrong , wrong ! Ye do not understand . He opens the door and flees into the night . HENRY falls into a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MATTIE comes sobbing up to him . HENRY Whirling and seizing MATTIE by the throat . Who are you ? I know : Mattie . You sew for the heathen and worry your husband 's life out about dirt . Now in the grave they 'll be plenty of dirt . And you sing , and you sing ; and you talk and you talk . He grabs the remaining bottle and uncorks it . Drink this here bottle o ' stuff . p. 33 MATTIE Clenching her teeth and fighting back . I wo n't , I wo n't ! It 'll poison me , it 'll kill me ! HENRY Pulling open her mouth and pouring the contents in . Nunh  --  unh , I reckin it wo n't ! She swallows and coughs and strangles , then drops to the floor crying . HENRY strides about the room kicking the furniture to pieces and throwing out his shoulders and shouting . I 'm a new man , a man o ' might , a he-man in Israel ! Turning upon MATTIE . And you have drunk the drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He drops back in his chair in a dying posture . MATTIE Oh , Henry , Henry , baby ! HENRY When I 'm gone , take care of Pa . Let him live in peace . Let him have his tobacco and spet in the far . MATTIE crawls on her knees before him and lays her head in his lap , weeping . MATTIE Get the doctor , Father . Hitch up and go for the doctor . Old JERNIGAN starts for the door . HENRY jumps up and snatches him back . HENRY You ai n't , you ai n't . Let me die in peace . There is the sound of a medley of voices outside . Women gabbling in excitement . MATTIE climbs up to her feet and runs to the door. p. 34 MATTIE Is that you , Mis ' Bella ? Come here , come here quick . Henry 's poisoned and he 's a-dying . The gabble and excitement outside increases . A voice replies from the yard . VOICE I 'm coming , Mattie , I 'm coming . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his chair and begins to bark like a dog , blubbering and growling . HENRY Shrieking again . I ' been bit by a mad dog . He barks . VOICE Lord a-mercy , he 's run mad ! A low murmur of horror rises from the women outside , followed by shrieks and then the sound of running feet . HENRY rushes out of the door barking and pursuing them . MATTIE Looking at old JERNIGAN through her tears ! He ai n't been bit by no mad dog ! HENRY Stuttering with excitement . Mebbe that 's the way the pizen works . That doctor said he got it a quare way in the middle of the night and a storm on and a ' old man helping him . MATTIE He 's crazy . Wringing her hands . Why 'd you let him give Henry that stuff ? The mess I took wo n't nothing , weak as water ! She goes to the door calling piteously . Henry ! Henry ! Old JERNIGAN comes up to the bottle she has dropped and looks at it. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong medicine , Mattie ! He tuk that there gray stuff and you tuk the red ! MATTIE At the door . Henry ! Henry ! HENRY comes back on the porch and gives a farewell bark . MATTIE runs out and throws her arms around him . He flings her from him and strides into the room . His shoes are covered with mud . He goes to the fireplace and stamps it off on the hearth . HENRY Running up to him excitedly . Hyuh , hyuh , you tuk that gray stuff . Look , look ! HENRY Waving him off . It do n't make no difference . ' Two n't nothing but water . MATTIE comes in and stares at him as he casually cleans his boot on the hearth . MATTIE Whimpering . What 's happened , Henry ? You seem  --  HENRY I been cured , that 's what . The medicine done it . He gets up , looks around the room , goes over to the machine , gathers up the clothes for the heathen , picks out a coat and trousers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's your Ransome Taylor coat and your britches . The heathen ai n't gon na git ' em . He wipes his shoes with the other garments and then calmly goes to his chair and sits down . MATTIE has been looking on a moment and then with a glad cry of comprehension falls on her knees by him and lays her head sobbing in his lap. p. 36 HENRY Dropping in his chair thunderstruck . Well , I be durned if I ever seed the beat ! He thinks a moment , and then bursts out in a low musical chuckle . His face spreads into a grin that breaks over his face in a thousand wrinkles . He cuts a caper on the floor , stopping now and then trying to comprehend what has happened . HENRY sits solemnly stroking MATTIE 'S head . The door is cracked open at the rear and DOCTOR IMMANUEL pokes his head in . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Masters of this house  --  HENRY Turning and snarling . Hanh  --  Scat ! He barks and the DOCTOR slams the door . After a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to come in and get his hat and case . MATTIE 'S sobs gradually die away . Yeh , I know , poor child . I did scare you , did n't I ? Only a whimper from MATTIE and hugging of HENRY 'S knees answered him . HENRY At the door . Come on in , doctor , and get yer stuff . He ai n't gon na hurt you . The DOCTOR comes gravely in and gets his case and hat . HENRY Pa , give him that five dollars . p. 37 HENRY His sides shaking with enjoyment . Hyuh , hyuh , it is . You done it , Doc , same as you said you would . HENRY And you need n't come back . I do n't need you ! He lifts his head with decision written on his face . Lemme have a look at the plug of tobacco , Pa . DOCTOR IMMANUEL At the door . Remember that I am always at your service . Peace abide with you and this house always . I am on my way now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You need n't bother about us . We ai n't gon na need you no more . Are we , Mattie ? MATTIE shakes her head . DOCTOR IMMANUEL Going out . As you all know , wherever I go , My name is Immanuel . He closes the door and his chant dies away in the might . HENRY I said , Pa , I 'd like a look at that tobacco . MATTIE Raising her head . Do n't you spit on  --  HENRY Crushing her back on the floor . Nanh , nanh , I tell you I been cured . I 'm boss . Breaking into a loud roaring laugh . Horray ! Horray ! I 'm another man . I 'm cured , I 'm boss . Gim me that ' backer . The old man hands it to him eagerly . HENRY bites off an enormous chew and hands the plug back . Old JERNIGAN hesitates a moment and then also bites off a mouthful . A look of deep content comes over him . He snuggles into a chair and chews . HENRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signifies to the old man with a motion of his hand that he spit first . Old JERNIGAN with signs refuses . HENRY spits profusely and loud in the direction of the fire . Old JERNIGAN does likewise. p. 38 HENRY Eyeing HENRY slyly , as he rolls his tobacco sweetly , in his mouth . Hee  --  hee ! MATTIE sits hugging HENRY 'S knees . HENRY Nodding happily and wisely . Unh-hunh-yeh . They sit saying nothing . Presently HENRY looks over at the old man and laughs suddenly and deeply . HENRY What ? HENRY I run them there women right into the mudhole out there . HENRY Beating his thigh gleefully . Hee-hee ! Hee-hee ! HENRY I shore did . They lapse into silence . By this time MATTIE has somewhat raised her head and is staring contemplatively by HENRY 'S chin into the fire . HENRY Shivering a bit and stirring the fire . Gon na be cold Henry , cold . HENRY Yeh . HENRY Robins been flying towards the South all day . They both lean towards the fire and spit.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
