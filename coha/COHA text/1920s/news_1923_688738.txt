txt Here is a new slant at the immigration question . A statistical comparison issued yesterday indicate that detective stock runs far stronger among the foreign born white population than among the white native born . The computations were maao , y 11 . Laughlin , assistant of the psychopathic laboratory of the Chicago MuniCipal court , and assistant director of the Carnegie research bureau In Cold Springs Harbor , N. Y. They have been placed with Washington authorities as part of the argument for a new immigration policy that will apply the eugenical principle . . Will Urge Stricter Laws . The theory la expected to be strongly advanced before the next congress that instead of letting down the barriers for another tide of cheap European common labor , which some large employing groups urge , the law should be changed to restrict not only the number of immigrants but to limit them as to their hereditary mental and physical grade . Dr. Laughlin in his study extended the army draft rating to the whole white population of the United States . both native and foreign born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of 13.920,692 in 1920 , about 5,500,000 rated below the average in fundamental intelligence . Out of a native born population of 61.105,000 about 39,800,000 were below the average . In other words , the number below average was 49 per cent among the native white population and 62 per cent among the foreign horn . In the two lowest grades the disparity was even greater . Bulk of " Inferior " Alien Dern . In the class termed " inferior " the table places 17 per cent of the native whites , as compared with 31 per cent of the foreign born . In the group marked " very inferior , " the figures put 7 per cent of the native whites , as against about 15 per cent of the foreign born . Into these two groups combined , " inferior " and " very inferior , " fell 24 per cent of the native whites , and 95.6 per cent of the foreign born whites  --  almost double . . Where the foreign born ' population thus can stronger in low graders than the native whites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tables place in the " very superior " group . which is the highest rating , about 4 per cent of the native white population , and a trifle over 1 per cent of the foreign born . Jn the second class , marked " superior , " the figures show 8 per cent of the natives and less than 3 per cent of the foreign born . Into the third group , rated as " high average , " fall 15 per cent of the native whites , as against 7.3 per cent of the foreign born whites . Natives Hold Superiority . Combining these three groups , the tables show that 27.2 per cent of the native whites grade above the average , as compared with 11.3 per cent of the foreign ' born whites . Dr. Laughlin 's figures , extending the army draft ratings to the entire white population , are : Native Army draft ratings ? ? white .

They show that the native white population where both parents were foreign born had 65 per cent more than its expected ratio of feeble-minded , indicating that some of this group of immigration carried a hereditary defect which the scientists point out might have been kept out of the country if the laws required an examination into the history of family stock before admission . In the population group where one parent is foreign born and one native born , the feeble-minded ran even higher , being 00 per cent above the expected ratio , indicating a tendency on the art of inferior strains to mate .
