I F nations at Christmas time should take stock of their best gifts , America would thank whatever-gods she worships for the courage of her political prisoners . In the stifling air of diplomatic bargaining and the compromises of everyday life the faith of men who chose prison rather than betray the right " to know , to utter , and to argue freely according to conscience " stirs like a cleansing wind . Let Americans read Mr. Doran 's letter ( published in our correspondence columns ) and rejoice that 147 men in Federal penitentiaries and scores of others in State prisons have resisted the weight of oppression and the lure of qualified freedom in order to hold fast those things which they have believed . But let no American rejoice that five of those prisoners have been kept for months in solitary confinement and that all of them are treated as society treats her common felons and ought to treat no living soul . It is rumored that Debs will shortly be released . No such belated and partial amnesty can take the stain from America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political prisoners still in jail is not a Christmas when the most optimistic can believe that mankind has found the road to peace . IME R. HUGHES 'S naval ratio need take no account of the needs or desires of oppressed peoples. , The conscripted blacks of French Senegambia , the Haitian and Dominican victims of American atrocities , the Korean patriots , the vast populations of India  --  these peoples do not threaten the balance of power between their masters with competitive building of battleships . Nevertheless , the desire for world peace which ignores theM is as lacking in intelligence as it is in idealism . These reflections acquire point from Gandhi 's recent declaration in India : Lord Reading must understand that the Non-Cooperators are at war with the Government . We are challenging the Government 's might , because its activities are evil . We want to overthrow the Government and compel its submission to the people 's will . Free life is impossible under the present Government . We will have to stagger humanity even as South Africa and Ireland did  --  with this exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that of our opponents . The declaration against the use of violence comes from a man who has seen his own son and many of his most distinguished comrades imprisoned . But in the face of wholesale repression the Non-Cooperation Movement is still strong in its adherence to non-violence . The empty streets which greeted the Prince of Wales in Allahabad were more effective than riots . Whether humanity is capable of the effective resistance Gandhi plans is yet to be proved , but the effort he has already made is more significant for world peace thamall the jockeying of the diplomats at Washington . S trillion rubles  --  that is the current value in Russian paper money of the congressional appropriation of $20 , - 000,000 for purchase of grain for relief in Russia ; at least it was a few days ago  --  today it may be less or more . It sounds stupendous ; wisely distributed  --  we hope that Mr. Hoover will allocate part of it to the Quakers , and to the Near East Relief for its work in the soviet republics of the Caucasus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufferers over the hungry winter . But estimates of the need call for at least $50,000,000 ? and the other funds available make up very little of the deficit . There is still bitter need for individual giving . Cynics may say that the appropriation passed Congress chiefly because it meant $20,000,000 worth of relief to the farmers of the Middle West who can not market their crops ; that is true , but we can only rejoice that a work of charity relieves twice , here and again in Russia . Moreover , the fact that the Middle West is beginning to discover how closely its prosperity is intertwined with Europe is a hopeful augury at a time when the powers that be seem so set on discouraging belief in international cooperation . International bankers who know their business tell us that the world will not recover from its present depression without some sort of international economic conference but that European and Wall Street bankers are so distrusted that the initiative must come from the Middle West . Perhaps Russian relief may be the first step toward that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution to such a conference . A
