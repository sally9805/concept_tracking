Calvin Coolidge retired from the Presidency because he felt that no man could , in that office , give the people the best service for longer than eight years . He had been told that the Kansas City nomination was his for the taking . He felt that his re-election was " assured . " Yet , obedient to a desire to get back to the people , he said , " I-do-not-choose-to-run " in South Dakota and followed that up by despatching his secretary to the Republican National Convention to tell the leaders of unpledged State delegations not to vote for him . <P> So announced Citizen Coolidge last week , in a brief article , the second of a series for William Randolph Hearst 's Cosmopolitan magazine . The title was : " Why I Did Not Choose To Run . " His retirement , he explained , was prompted more by an inner impulse of what was right than by specific facts-reasons , he admitted , which " may not appear very convincing . " <P> With deliberation he chose the fourth anniversary of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " chose " early enough to give the G. O. P. a chance to select his successor . He had , he said , no feeling that the no-third-term tradition applied to him , as he had come up from the vice presidency and he was sure that the country shared his opinion . But ten years in the White House was too long a strain . Wrote Mr. Coolidge : <P> " It is difficult to conceive how one man can successfully serve the country for a term as President of more than eight years . " <P> Mr. Coolidge sought to avoid the appearance of selfish " grasping for office . " Presidents , he found , " are always surrounded by worshipers . They are constantly . . . assured of their greatness . They live in an artificial atmosphere of adulation and exaltation which sooner or later impairs their judgment . They are in grave danger of becoming careless and arrogant . " <P> The latter part of the administrations of two-term Presidents , he thought , showed " very little in the way of constructive accomplishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " These facts , coupled with his own desire , Mr. Coolidge gave as his reasons for retirement . <P> To him there was nothing mystifying about his " I-do-not-choose " statement . His reason for refusing to say specifically that he would refuse the nomination if it came to him , was because " it would not be in accordance with my conception of the requirements of the Presidential office . " His determination was to prevent his nomination and to this end he sent his secretary Everett Sanders- " a man of great ability and discretion " - to Kansas City to divert convention votes for him . Wrote Mr. Coolidge ( Editor Ray Long of Cosmopolitan italicized it ) : " Had I not done so , I am told , I should have been nominated . " <P> Citizen Coolidge said he was careful to take no part in the primary campaigns . He found no reason for his participation for " the party had plenty of presidential material . . . and the candidate should really be the choice of the people themselves . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a nomination , he felt , would often prove a handicap to the nominee .
