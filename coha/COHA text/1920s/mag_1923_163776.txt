Tennis circles rocked when Manuel Alonso of the Spanish Davis Cup team beat William T. Tilden , II , national champion , for the Illinois State open singles title . Most critics agreed that Tilden was near his best , and that Alonso won on his own merits-placement and force in cross-court driving , plus able net work . The score : 8-6 , 11-13 , 6-3 , 6-1 . Tilden and Alonso had met several times before this season , always to the former 's advantage . This upset is regarded as one of the biggest in net history . A similar occurrence was in 1921 , when Vincent Richards wrested the Rhode Island crown from Tilden , but present concern is greater than it then was because the winner is an invader . The current question on tennis porches is : " Will Tilden weaken in the Davis Cup matches ? "
