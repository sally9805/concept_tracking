The figurehead of the Nancy Bray has been torn from its place and nailed to the forepost , facing the stern  --  back to back , as it were , with its former position . It is the half-length of an angel bearing wreaths ; she is highly colored and buxom , and has flowing yellow hair . On the deck lie three persons in the last stages of rags and exhaustion : Minna , the remnant of a stout , coarse woman ; Van , a little , sharp youth ; and a fat , old sleepy Jamaica Sam . VAN ( Driving the last nail into the figurehead ) : There she is . She 's the new Gawd of the Atlantic . It 's only a she-Gawd , but that 's a good enough Gawd for a sailor . MINNA ( Seated on the deck ) : Us 'll call her Lily . That 's a name like a god 's . SAM Youm be quick . Youm say your prayers quick . MINNA ( Blubbering ) : Her ca n't hear us . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VAN Her 's an angel . Her knows everything . ( He throws himself on his knees and lays his forehead on the boards . In a hoarse whisper : ) That 's the joss way . We all got t'do it . ( The others do likewise. ) p. 3 SAM Us 'll pray in turns . Us must be quick . There ai n't no more water to drink , and there ai n't no more sails left to carry us on . Us 'll have to be quick . Youm begin , Van . Youms a great lad with the words . VAN ( With real fanaticism ) : Great Gawd Lily , on the ship Nancy Bray , all 's lost with us if you do n't bring us rain to drink . All the secret water I saved aside is drunk up , and we got to go over the side with the rest if you do n't bring us rain today  --  or tomorrow . Youm always been the angel on the front of this yere ship Nancy Bray , and you ai n't goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer , great Gawd Lily . Amen . MINNA Great God Lily , I 'm the captain 's wife that 's sailed behind you for twenty years . Many 's the time , great God Lily , that I shined your face so you 'd look spick and span and we sailing into London in the morning , or into heathen lands . You knows everything , and you knows what I did to my husband and that I did n't let him have none of the secret water that me and Van saved up , and that when he died he knew it and cursed me and Van to hell . But youms forgiven everything and send us some rain or by-and-by we 'll die and there 'll be no one here prayin ' to you . This is the end of my prayin ' , great God Lily . VAN ( Whispers ) : Say Amen . p. 4 MINNA Amen , great God Lily . SAM I ai n't goin ' to pray .

SAM God forgive me , great God Lily , I 'm old Jamaica Sam that do n't never go ashore . Amen . I 'd be drowned , too , only for Van and the captain 's wife , who gave me some of the secret water , so that if they died I could roll ' em over the side and not leave ' em on the clean deck . Amen . Youms known my whole life , great God Lily , and how I stole the Portagee 's red bag , only it was almost empty , and and that other thing . Send a lot of rain and a ship to save us . Amen . VAN ( Crawling up beneath the figure and throwing himself full length ; hysterically ) : You 've gone and forgiven me everything . Sure you have . I did n't kill the captain . The secret water was mine . Save us now , great Gawd Lily , and bring me back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his three coal barges . MINNA ( Rocking herself ) : We 'm lost . She 'll save Sam , but I 've done what the gods do n't like . They 'm after me . They 've got me now . ( Suddenly staring off the deck ) Van ! Van ! Them 's a ship coming to us . Van , look ! ( She falls back crying. ) p. 5 VAN Them 's comin ' ! SAM ( Trying to jump up and down ) : It 's the Maria Theresa Third , comin ' right at us . VAN ( His eye falls on the angel ) : What 'll they say to the figgerhead here ? SAM ( Sententiously ) : But that 's the great God Lily . Her 's saved us . You ai n't goin ' to do anything to her ? VAN ( Starting to beat the angel forward with his hammer ) : They 'll call us heathen , bowin ' down to wood and stone . Get the rope , Sam . We 'll put her back .
