Gomez of Venezuela , President . <P> Leguia of Peru , President . <P> Saavedra of Bolivia , President . <P> According to an apparently authoritative article in Current History , these three Presidents are three despots , double-dyed villains , low-born knaves , blood-sucking tyrants , enemies of light . Their points of similarity are : <P> a ) They usurped power . <P> b ) They send their political rivals to jail , to mid-ocean islands or to Australia , whence , if lucky , they escape to New York . <P> c ) They suppress newspapers . <P> d ) They dismiss parliaments . <P> e ) They disarm the army if necessary . <P> f ) They get money from " Wall Street " to continue their business . <P> But Gomez , a pure-blooded Indian , who has played the despot game longest , is unique in having built a family caste . The two vice presidents of Venezuela are Gomez frre and Gomez fils . <P> Leguia , the handsomest , is Spanish . At one point in his career he acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he secured his election as President of Peru . But for some unexplained reason he found it necessary to seize power by a revolution only a week before his predecessor 's term would have legally expired . <P> Leguia has entered into a villainous alliance with Saavedra of Bolivia . They exchange their enemies for torture , so that malcontents in either country experience physical torture in both . <P> Saavedra 's claim to distinction rests with his importation of a German general and other officers ( in spite of the Versailles Treaty ) . These officers put the entire Bolivian army under the guard of armed irregular forces . They also established a nationwide system of espionage which is said to be a wonder of perfection . <P> All three countries are predominantly Catholic . The existence of these tyrants is a challenge to the effectiveness of Catholicism when it is almost solely responsible for the moral fibre of a nation . <P> And the charge that these tyrants are backed by Wall Street raises the old questions : Does money recognize any morality ? When a banker steps into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk ? <P> Possibly the editors of Current History will receive letters of protest this week and next .
