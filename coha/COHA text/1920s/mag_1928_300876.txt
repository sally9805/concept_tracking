Sixteen years ago , when he was three , Harry Braun arrived from Russia . A melancholy urchin , he lounged in Manhattan ghettoes , not playing with the tougher ragamuffins but crooning to himself . By the time that he was eleven , it was plain to Mrs. Braun that he would be the world 's greatest musician . She bought him a $10 fiddle and said , " Play yet . " <P> Surprisingly soon after his mother bought the fiddle for him , Harry Braun met Leopold Auer , greatest teacher of violinists . Leopold Auer was interested in meeting the adolescent minstrel as he is in meeting all youthful violinists ; he remained interested in Harry Braun . When Harry Braun was a little older he met Zinc-King August Heckscher , who gave him a $25,000 Stradivarius . <P> Harry Braun 's most recent acquaintance is shrewd Banker Otto Hermann Kahn . Last week it became known that Otto Kahn had not given him any money with which to further his studies ; instead , he had asked Harry Braun to come to Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together ; after that there will be scenes abroad in which Harry Braun plays for kings and queens or performs as soloist for Paris philharmonic societies or the London Symphony , while Otto Kahn stands and listens . In New York , a job with the Philharmonic awaits him .
