txt Thomas A. Edison , who has dealt in marvels all his life , was amazed at some of the things he saw today in the General Electric Company laboratories on his first visit here in twenty-five years . He saw a mercury boiler so much more efficient than steam that when it is perfected it will mean a saving of one-third in coal used to produce power . He saw a machine for registering the voice by light on a moving picture film that has unlimited possibilities of development ? including talking - movies . And he saw vacuum tubes that have in them the germ of greater things than the world has yet known in electrical science . The day was in all ways a tribute to Edison , for although the application of electron energy , as demonstrated to him , is the beginning of a new science , the future of which is so yast that physicists dare not predict what may be found in it , they traced it all to his invention forty-three years ago of the incandescent bulb , the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Rice Jr. , an officer of the company , said , " Is destined to revolutionize our present methods of generation , transmission and utilization of electricity . " So they called him " Master " and showed hire things of which he had not dreamed when he blazed - the path . Lightning Bolts Juggled for Him . Steinmetz juggled his lightning bolts for him , splintered wood and dissipated metal in a flash of fire until Edison 's eyes sparkled ; Langmuir showed him tubes that Edison thought might mean / much in long-distance transmission of power until " you ca n't tell lvhere it will end , " and he held a 100,000 candle power incandescent lamp which made his own first bulb seem like the glow of a firefly , a bulb which he did not be- , lieve could have been built . It was a great day for Edison and a great day for the physicists of the company , for it marked the achievements of forty years . There were meetings also between Edison and some of his old employes , men who worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1886 and which are still a part of the General Electric plant . There was Jules Tournier , who Joined Edison in 1881 and invented many wiring devices ; C. H. Kaler , a toolmaker , who went to Schenectady with him from the New York plant ; Christian G. linch. who started with Edison in MO ; Alfred Dugglin , who joined the plant in 1887 ; Wiliam S. Andrews , who was an engineer with Edison for many years , and is now a consulting engineer with the General Electric , and H. F. T. Erben. now works manager for the company . He drew Edison to a window and pointed over the roofs to the two original buildings . " Remember ? " he said to him , and Edison nodded and smiled . " Remember that old tower we used to work in ? It stood just beyond there . Remember when we worked three nights on that old dynamo ? " And Edison laughed and glanced back . " Good days , " he said . It was D o'clock in the morning when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Rice 's home . Charles Edison , his son , was with him , and Mrs. Edison joined him later to see the lightning . He was welcomed at the entrance to the research laboratory by Gerard Swope , President of the company ; A. W. Eurcha.rd , Vice President , and Dr. W. R. Whitney , director of the laboratory . He went into Dr. Whitney 's office first and , in the glare of studio lights so that moving pictures might be made by the company to record his visit , signed his ' name in the book of distinguished visitors . From then on the lights and photographers followed him everywhere . Dr. Whitney took him to the basement , where he showed him the furnace in which metalized filament for lamps is made , and Mr. Edison held a bit of it on his finger while cameras clicked . There also was liquid air , the coldest thing in the world , and from that room he went to the room where in a heat of 5,500 degrees Fahrenheit , the greatest heat ' , produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a furnace and drawn out into wires . Dr. W. D. Coolidge , whose - X- rays are used all over the world , explained the operation of the furnaces to him . From there he went to the room wherell Dr. Irving Langmuir , inventor of the vacuum tubes , which the other day took the piece of enormous alternators in sending wireless messages across the Atlantic , showed him some of the big lamps he and his assistants have been working on . Edison bent his hands around them , gestured and talked of the difficulties of making them , for he hod tried to and failed for lack of time . The radio room h5 1d a lot of the vacuum tubes which Mr. Edison had heard of and wanted to see almost more than anything else in the place . The evolution by which they were changed from air-cooled to water-cooled tubes , so that they could be built larger and larger to carry more and more power , was explained , and he listened , hand cupped behind his ear like a delighted boy . In the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which waved up and down to make a vizualization of energy waves as they are built up on the receiving antennae of a wireless plant , and when Edison was told what they were by Chester W. Rice , he laughed and said : " Takes the place of mathematics . " The pallo photo phone , the machine which registers pound on a moving picture film so that voices and music may be reproduced in ordinary wireless loudspeaking phones and may be developed into talking movies in which the picture and sound would be perfectly synchronized , was demonstrated to Edison by the inventor , C. A. Hoxie . " What next ? " said Mr. Edison , lifting his shoulders in a quick shrug . 1Iow the Machine Works . This machine , while still in the experimental stage , has had great things predicted for it . The record is made by causing the sound waves to produce vibrations on a minute mirror . A beani of light reflected by the mirror strikes a photographic film kept in motion and which , when developed , shows a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspond to the sound reproduced . On account of the small mirror , its low inertia , and other factors , it is possible to produce a sound record which includes the very delicate overtones which give quality to music and speech and which , it was said , had not been so successfully accomplished by any other method of recording sound waves . The reproduction of the sound from the film is accomplished by moving the film in front of a delicate electrical device which produces an electromotive force that varies with the amount of light falling upon it . By a combination of vacuum or electron tubes an apparatus has been produced which responds to variation in the light falling on it with a speed so high that it can only be compared with that of light itself , or with the speed of the propagation of wireless waves in space . Therefore when this film is moved continuously in front Of such a device , the device produces an electric current corresponding very accurately to the original sound wave . This electric current may be used to operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to operate the radio transmitting station WGY of the General ? Electric Company . Mr. Edison was asked to talk into the machine . so that a record of his voice on the film might be made , but he declined . " You ca n't get me to tale , even on a phonograph , " said the inventor of the phonograph . A method of taking the last bit of gas out of a vacuum tube was demonstrated by Dr. Langmuir . It was a small induction coil , which was set down over the tube , or electric bulb .. The current penetrated the glass without heating it , and made the filament in the bulb glow , so as to burn up the gas . Dr. Langmuir put a small file inside the coil , and it turned red , and then told- Mr. Edison to put his finger in the coil . He did so and laughed , as his finger did not even warm . He had seen Induction coils before , but not this application of them . Steinmetz Takes Him In Hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz. the electrical wizard of the plant , chief consulting engineer , who had one of his famous cigars drooping as always from his mouth . They went out in the yard together to see a plaque of Edison which had been placed above the door to commemorate his work . Many of the employes were gathered there and gave Edison ' three rousing cheers . The wind was sharp , and Dr. Steinmetz , as is his custom , was clad only in a thin alpaca suit , with no hat on his hair , which stands up almost straight . Edison put his hand down and ruffled the hair and said : " W'hy do n't you put your hat on ? " " No , never , ' said Steinmetz , shrugging disdainfully . Dr. Steinmetz took him in charge then and went over to the big electrical laboratory where he is sole ruler . In the place where Dr. Steinmetz has reproduced the phenomena of lightning in making experiments to test lightning arresters and insulation , Mrs. Edison was waiting behind a screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to splinter wood . There were 120,000 volts in the big plates up near the ceiling . From them a wire led to a large electrode . About five inches below it was another electrode , from which a wire led to a piece . of elm limb about five inches long and three thick . When Dr. Steinmetz gave the signal electricity began to gather in the plates , corresponding to storm clouds , until it reached 120,000 volts , When it exploded like a rifle shot across the gap and the piece of wood fell to pieces . Some of the bark fell twenty feet away . " Would you like to see another piece of wood split ? " asked Leroy Hayden , Dr. Steinmetz 's assistant . " Yes , yes , " exclaimed Mr. Edison . Another bit of elm was blown apart , and then an insulator , protected by Dr. Steinmetz 's lightning arrester , was placed on the table . The cells exploded , and the insulator stood up . On the next ' test with the arrester removed the insulator was cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Dr. Steinmetz had them placed , remarking as he moved back : " Now we will see what happens . " Fe had tried it before and knew . Nothing happened ; the insulators stood up . Now we will convert some tungsten into helium , " said Dr. Steinmetz . " Some people claim that they can change one metal into another by high electric currents . We have never been able to do that here . " But when the tungsten was put on the table and the lightning hit it , it vanished . Helium gas it was supposed to turn into , although Dr. Steinmetz said they had never tested the gas to make sure . Dr. Steinmetz has a way of discharging 250,000 volts , and ifs qow working on ope to throw 600,000 VOUS , If hedid it in his laboratory , however , it would wreck the place . Several other buildings were visited . and then Mr. Edison was taken to the turbine shop , where the turbines for driving battleships and electric generators are made . One was there of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n-candle power Edison lamps , enough for a city of 200,000 persons . Huge turning . ! tithes were there and overhead enormous cranes . operated by Foreman " aviators , " as they call themselves . In one of the turbine shops the new mercury boiler was shown him by the inventor , W. L. R. Emmet , engineer in charge of turbine work . This boiler was built to utilize the heat efficiency which is lost in steam boilers . The mercury is vaporized at a heat of 1,000 degrees and the vapor goes at a relatively low pressure into a turbine . From there it passes into a condenser , where it condenses at a temperature so much higher than is necessary to heat water that the condenser acts as a heater for a steam boiler , the steam from which goes to a steam turbine . Then the condensed mercury , still at high temperature , goes back to its own boiler . The mercury boiler it was c-xpla.ined , increases the output of kilowatt ? ! nergy per unit of coal some 30 per cent. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coal were used in Li strain boiler , only ltd ) pounds would be used in the mercury boiler , a great increase in efficiency . " You look doubtful , " said Mr. Emmet to air . Edison , " and I do n't blame you . " " No , I never thought water was the best way , " said Edison . After they left this plant Mr. Edison with officials of the company drove up and down Works Avenue , the central street , where most of the 18,000 employes had gathered to see the man whose pioneer work ' had made the plant possible . Then Edison and the " Old Timers " went to luncheon at the fire house in the yards , where he sat with Mr. Andrews , Mr. Tournier , and Charles Clark , another of his old associates . In the afternoon Mr. Edison was taken to see some of the secret inventions of the physicists , things which are carefully guarded pending their perfection . Asked to tell what he thought of what he had seen , Mr. Edison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he happened to establish his plant in Schenectady because he found a plant cheap where money was scarce . " I wanted to see the old place and the old boys . " he said , " and I 'm here . I wanted particularly to see what Steinmetz and Langmuir and Whitney were up to . It is a very remarkable layout . Some of the inventions I am familiar with , and sonic I am not . " I had no success with the tungsten lamp . I tried it many years ago and am surprised that Coolidge had success with such a rebellious metal . I would not have thought it possible thirty years ago . It goes to show'that if YOU want something bad enough and stick to it , you will ' get it . I had a great many other things to do and I could n't stick . " The mercury boiler ? I think there is something in that . It is like playing poker with all blue Ohips : it is risky business , but it may dome out all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gamble if you get anywhere . " The lightning was very interesting . I have never worked with such a high voltage . The possibilities are leading to greater long-distance and high-voltage transmission , and you can not tell where it will end . The vacuum tube is one of the things I am most interested in . This plitron tube should lead to a greater advance in radio . It does n't look to me tee if you could transmit power with it , but may be you can under certain conditions . It opens another big field . " Mr. Edison spoke of his ? own experiment with talking-movies , and said that while they seemed to him to succeed they did not meet with public approval because of what he called a " psychological phenomenon . " He left Schenectady in the evening to return to his home in East Orange , after a reception at the Mohawk Golf Club .
