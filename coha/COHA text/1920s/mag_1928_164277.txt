The Fascist march on Rome was wholly militant and partially armed . It compelled a quavering cabinet to yield , to vanish . Very different was a march upon Bucharest last week , staged by 60,000 peaceful peasants . Their revered leader , Dr. Juliu Maniu , threatened no more than that the peasants would wait quietly in the streets for four days , meanwhile petitioning Premier Vintila Bratiano to resign . <P> Strangely enough , although M. Bratiano heads an intensely militant oligarchy of land owners and industrialists-although he dominates the police and the army-there was a possibility that he might resign , or at least so reorganize his cabinet as to give the peasants a voice in the government , which they have not had for decades . <P> The nation is not so ready to accept the dictatorship of Vintila Bratiano , a single-track pedantic conservative , as it was to obey his late brother Jon Bratiano , that born dictator and multitalented statesman ( TIME , Dec. 5 ) . Moreover the 60,000 waiting , shuffling peasants must have been a strong reminder that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election to be held in Rumania during the past decade , it would certainly have been swept out of power by the peasant party . Faced by such facts would Vintila Bratiano bend now or break later ? The peasants munched their rations , waited patiently .
