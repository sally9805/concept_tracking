FOR ATTENTION rivetting , no show on Broadway , no newspaper column , no beautiful lady , no radio returns from a football game , no ghost story no nothing  --  com-pare with the indicator hoard in the Public Library . Look at the faces of the watchers and waiters on that bench , under a hypnotic spell , each holding a card tightly in a fist , each waiting for a number as though its flash would herald death , or maybe just life eternal . A S THE SEASON of good will / 1 when all the world exchanges cards of merry greeting draws nigh , most of us like to imagine that there are hundreds of bright-faced artists and poets busily engaged somewhere in turning out the pretty Christmas cards that flood the market . But this is not the case . This year 's Christmas cards were designed and printed and in the hands of traveling salesmen last May . In other words as the holiday season approaches , life continues to he as much of a delusion as ever .

He sent caramels . AMONG the raw-mushroom-red- lobster- on - ice - in - the - window type of restaurants , none is more to be respected than Drake 's in West Forty-second Street . Women are still forbidden to smoke there . It is probably the last bulwark of Victorianism in the Broadway district . Ardent though we are in feminism , we applaud this stand ; not for worlds would we see pass this quaint preserver of the manners of another age . HERETOFORE the few miserable , craven fellows who have wasted their time obeying the prohibition law and throwing bouquets to Emory Buckner , have been able to give as their excuse that drinking was too expensive . But they can no longer do so , Mr. Woolworth 's five and ten cent stores are now offering a very serviceable cocktail shaker composed of two ten-cent lemonade glasses and a ten-cent vacuum rubber ring .

If you enter the Park at Fifth Avenue and Seventy-second Street in a car any evening and crane out of the window to read the sentences which pass across the ruddy Columbus Circle sky , the bank is still telling you about its resources , its central location and general availability as you drive out onto Broadway . Your wonder is tempered only by the thought of how much vital information you are missing by not stopping to read the sign to its conclusion . er HE peculiar droning sound heard in the busses up and down the length of the Avenue a fortnight ago was nothing more or less than the much-vaunted Voice of the People being raised against the pay-as-you-enter system . And the bus company , inclining its ear , has subsequently done away with that system , for which act glorier in excelsis .

Quite a showing resulted . A little woman standing in the corner said she had a talent for elocution , and a man in the middle aisle said he used to give readings , and a lady in the balcony said she was sure she had a talent , but she had n't had much use for it siRce she was married . Really almost everybody present could boast oratorical ability , it seemed , and the proceedings were rather dull until a woman finally arose majestically and said , " Well , Miss McPherson , God has given me the talent for raising money and ... " Her words , it is said , were drowned by applause .

And even this youthful writer can remember the time when his mother , returning from a " drive " along the Hudson , shocked the family by the incredible news that she had counted , herself , without exaggeration , thirty " horseless carriages " during the afternoon . Today the town holds hundreds of ghostly carriage-rooms where the dust falls undisturbed on wheel , pole and shaft , and where the upholstery of once stylish seats now rots in tragic silence . The station-wagon and the governess cart stand wheel to wheel with the majestic coach . On the seat o , f the governess cart  --  you called it the ponycart  --  is still perhaps the spot that marks the day when you cut your finger picking raspberries . Scree of these carriages once proudly toiled the streets of New York , and some were for the country only . There was a proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the wrong one . The country brougham had basketwork around the back and nice red wheels , but the city brougham was dark and formal maroon with black lines . They used to crowd and fight at the entrance to the Opera House as the motors do now . And the heavy landau was the same color : used for going to church sometimes , or going calling when the passengers were too many for the brougham . On sunny days the top was down . Of all carriages , the landau has disappeared the most completely . The victoria still lives in certain places and has a use , but the vis-a-vis is never taken out . This was a charming vehicle , covered with a silken-fringed canopy which rose from a socket behind , under which old ladies could take their afternoon rides in safety from the sun . The seats , as the name implies , were facing each other . They were broad and comfortable . The step swept low to the ground , the springs curved high in the rear , and the box in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunning carriages are quietly rotting . They are worth a few dollars apiece for the iron that is in them ; but as a rule , the owners prefer , out of sentiment , to keep them rather than sell them to the wrecker . The generation that used these carriages in its heyday is still alive . No doubt the wrecker , who gets everything in time , will get these specters also . Sold ! THE PASSING of Uncle Joe Cannon has revived a Jot of stories , as is fitting , and one typical and human legend has to do with his rather disgraceful overcoat , born black , but through years of honest service , changed to a greenish hue . Uncle Joe 's cherished and prominent daughter , a little embarrassed by her father 's loyalty to the well-worn ulster , finally extracted a promise that he would at least look at the season 's offerirws of a fashionable men 's wear establishment . Knowing well her father 's thriftiness , however , the fair lady framed a side with the shop manager , selected a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructing the salesman to lead Mr. Cannon to believe that the coat was an odd size , out of stock , and consequently available at the ridiculously low price of $25 . The ruse worked ; but on the first trip to his offices in the new coat , Mr. , Cannon was met by several of his senatorial cronies . Bantering comments were of course exchanged , one of them remarking that it must have set him back a hit . " What 's your guess ? What 's it worth ? " he coun-Uncorrupted BERNARD Bo trrET DE M ?

The pair were shown an apartment by the superintendent  --  formerly called janitor  --  of a Sixth Avenue building . They liked it , but as in the case of many others , it was too dark . " Oh , that will change , " said the superintendent easily . " You see , the black shades have been down for two months . " Victory UNREST has been reported of late in the Carnegie Hall district following the installation of a loud-speaking voice amplifier on the front of the Rev. Straton 's Baptist Church on Fifty-seventh Street . Uldine Utley had been holding forth inside the edifice and from the instrument has issued her evangelistic treble . Reverberating through the neighborhood , it caused much unrest and distress . It is said to have disturbed particularly the hostesses of two bridge parties , a gentleman with a poker game and highballs and a playwright at work on a translation from the French , not to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families indulging in general conversation , and so forth , and sinners arriving early at the new Roger Kahn club with its mirrored floor and jazz . There was much talk of protesting to the authorities , but at this juncture it was learned that the matter had already been taken in hand by the American Society for the Advancement of Atheism which meets in a room in Carnegie Hall and considered itself aggrieved also . It is thus disclosed that this atheist society is still in existence . A year age it got much publicity when its founder , Charles A. Smith , applied for a charter at Albany , declaring that the object of the organization was " purely destructive . " He did not get the charter hut , we learn , the organization has continued without one , and has been sponsoring what is known as the Ingersoll Forum every Sunday evening in Carnegie Hall . These debates ( all about whether there is a God and Does Science Furnish Proof of One ? ) have attracted a respectable and quiet audience of young men of college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith is said to be a longhaired atheist of scattered enthusiasms but to have attracted several practical people to his side . A few weeks ago , they say , Dr. Straton accepted a challenge to debate at their forum , it being agreed that they , in turn , would attend his Sunday morning services . Dr. Straton , it is alleged , failed to appear and the atheists suspected a clever dodge to get them to church by subterfuge . As they did n't go , they consider it a victory . Smith , the founder , also sent a telegram to President Coolidge requesting that he refrain from using the name of the Deity in his Thanksgiving proclamation , declaring that it would insult the atheist population . Mr. Coolidge , it appears , not only used the name of the Deity , but issued the proclamation book of poems ; the current Automobile Salon will include among its super-exhibits a super-sport roadster on a super-eight Isotta-Fraschini , the ' body built by Fleetwood but designed by no less a person than the late Mr. Valentino himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some authority on this important matter , for we have had the pleasure of inspecting the car in person . Valentino spent a great deal of time and trouble working at the designs with Captain Ugo V. d'Annunzio , son of the poet and president of Isotta Motors ; it was the actor 's fourth Isotta and was to have been his masterpiece ; the fenders were planned to imitate airplane wings , their lines carrying out the sweep of the aulminum hood and cowl and we can confirm the rumor that the result resembles a great gray snake-skin , with a lining of flaming red morocco upholstery and a cobra as a radiator emblem completing the suggestion . Another Passing WITH the disappearance of Dreicer and Co. from Fifth Avenue announced for next spring , one of the oldest jewelry establishments on the island will cease to exist . Jacob Dreicer founded the business in 1866 , and not only was he the first man to go into the business of importing jewels other than diamonds into New York City , but he was the pioneer pearl dealer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory goes away back , were commonly called " tears " at that time , and even emeralds and rubies might have been so much glass so far as market ability went . Diamonds set in gold were the thing , and when Mrs. Isaac Bell bought an emerald necklace from Jacob Dreicer in 1876 for $6,000 everyone thought she was mad , but twenty or thirty years afterward she sold a single center stone from the necklace for $90,000 and founded a charity with the money . Mrs. Bell assisted Dreicer in other ways than by purchasing . When he opened his first shop ( it was at Broadway and Twenty-sixth Street , next the old Delmonico 's ) she would frequently order her victoria to drive up and stand before it . There it would remain for several hours , the footman beside it with a sable rug over his arm . As Mrs. Bell was a member of one of the twenty-five or so families in Manhattan who in those days could be considered " jewel buyers " this gave the store prestige . The real reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selecting stones , which trait he passed on to the son who was the head of the business until his own death a few years ago . So certain was the first Dreicer 's judgment that he could tell at a glance the best jewels in an entire collection . ONCE a large collection of gems 1 ,  - -  / was spread on a table before the elder Dreicer . He immediately singled out a ruby in the rough , saying , " I want that one . " When cut , this turnr .. : out to be the finest ruby in the world up to that date . Another time , two pearls were brought into his office for sale . He immediately recognized them as from a necklace he had sold eight years before . He notified ? ? , . wleit34 ( btx-s ; " Thank Heavens , Junior hat passed the tabloid age . " the purchaser , who said it was impossible , that the necklace had been in a safety deposit box for years and that they could not be his . Investigation proved Dreicer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearl robberies was disclosed . The Dreicers were always among the first in the move uptown . In 1885 they bought the old Wall residence at 292 Fifth Avenue owned by the parents of Berry Wall , who became known as " king of the dudes " ; in 1906 they constructed the present building at Forty-sixth Street . Subsequently they bought business property in Fifty-seventh Street , although the firm never occupied it . A monument to the family , and to the Dreicer appreciation of beauty , are the two buildings at the southwest corner of Fifth Avenue and Fifty-third Street . Here , in 1913 , they erected two low Gothic structures carefully designed to harmonize with St. Thomas ' church opposite and the two Vanderbilt houses adjoining . And now the two Vanderbilt houses are going . Revelation T o US the town 's itinerant bar had existed merely as an interesting myth until we came fairly upon it a few evenings ago in a studio where it had been brought at the behest of a gentleman giving a large party . While we waited for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting a foot to the brass rail for the first time  --  we learned the essential features concerning it . Several months ago a canny gentleman decided to enter a new industry and he forthwith bought the bar . Since then he has been renting it by the night . Twenty-five dollars is the charge , plus twenty-five dollars for installation , plus the pay of bartenders of the old school , plus the price of such liquor as he is requested to supply . The cost mounts up . His bill runs sometimes to four or five thousand dollars ? even higher , for vintage champagne and old brandies are supplied . The effect is charming . There are the glistening mirrors , the neatly pyramided bottles and tumblers , the painting of a nude lady overhead , cuspidors set in sand and a gilded cash register , which the bartender rings when the impish fancy moves him . The owner has been sue " Tell my little girl to take her cod liver oil ! " ? ? cessfuL He already is hooked solid for weeks ahead . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before dawn because the bar had to start for Long island and the next night 's party . The night after that , it was to be in New Jersey . " A long jump , " commented the barman . " We do n't get any rest at all these days . " Discovery A PPARENTLY , New York , along A with other world-cities , also has a statue to an unknown soldier . In the middle of the Bronx River , near 211th Street , stands the figure of a fighter of the Civil War , and twenty people who ought to know about it , or who might know , including the Municipal Art Commission , can tell us nothing . We were offered the information ( and we set it down for what it is worth ) that it is the only statue ever erected in the very bed of a river , that it was originally colored red and blue , that a bridge at one time crossed the stream near it , and that one Lazzarri who operated a tombstone quarry nearby was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veteran stands , grasping his weather-stained rifle and looking stolidly at the almost too-patient water at his feet . Keeping the Air Pure ALTHOUGH profanity is no longer considered anything remarkable on the stage or in print , it is still strictly taboo on the air . It seems the radio audience is sensitive on the subject . There is no official ruling , we are told , but it is an unwritten law in every studio . A few notable exceptions have been followed in each case by an apology . The most conspicuous lapse on record was that of a radio Santa Claus who delivered a nightly sermon from an outlying station . One night he inserted into his homily the familiar story about trying to get the Coast and getting hell . He got it from his listeners next day , They protested that they had kept the children up to hear Kris Kringle only to have the good old man swear . Suggestive songs , however , are apparently okeh . But even here censorship is evident in the doctoring of " Hell , the Girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by substituting " Gosh ! " ? AN UNFORESEEN result of prohibition has been explained by a young man who says it has caused a split between him and his father . They ca n't drink together any more because the father considers the son 's liquor poisonous and his own pre-war stock Lou good for any but himself . Gallantry DEPARTING from one of the night clubs at 4 A.M. on Sunday , a charming young couple found themselves in mild disagreement after entering a nighthawk taxicab . The lady was firm in her intention to go home ; her escort was equally determined that they should make a stop at another night club . Two conflicting addresses having been given , the cab proceeded on its way . Presently it jerked up at the curb and the couple glanced up to see the driver , cap in hand , bowing them out of the cab . " I always goes where the lady says , " he announced with manner .                   @ @
