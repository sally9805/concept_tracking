txt Arthur Evans of Tun TRIBI'N/1 staff writes from Edwardsville , Ill. , that the farmers In that neighborhood , like the farmers throughout the country , are protesting volubly and constantly , at the " hard times " now upon them , at the inequitable defla ? lion of prices forced upon them , at their loss of profits and the necessity of holding what littlel money they have until prices of manufactured I goods come down to within reasonable trading dietance of the price of their products . At the same time he finds one farmer who thus protests and then goes out to pay $20,000 cash for 100 more acres of land with which to add to his troubles . Mr. Evans remarks that case may not be typical . We agree that it may not be typical of the farmers of the country , but It is typical . of the kickers . Such complainers wail beyond tho point of reason . They do so partly because their neighbors are wailing and they do not want to assume a. superior position , and partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity of 1917-1849 instead of the normal year of 1913 . To that extent they are doing an injustice to themselves and to the country . Their most legitimate complaint Iles in the fact that their products can not be traded for other corm modttles in the same ratio that they were traded - in pre-war days . That , and not the lack of a mar- , ket for their goods , is preventing their purchasing 1 : depriving them of comforts , luxuries and advan tages to which they have grown accustomed , ant resulting In general depression of business . That in general the farming population of the - country Is not quite as bad oft as one listening talon ( - to their protests - might believe is Indicated by the Federal Reserve report for August . This show ) that the heavy movement of agricultural product , to market has been tho outstanding economic activ ity of the country during the month . To be sure they are not getting as much for these crops as tw , years ago , but that they are making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Federal Reserve system . Readjustment o costs in many agricultural lines has assured I profit In these lines . The farmers did not plant a rising costs and sell or hold their stocks on a de dining market , as last year . Even freight rat ( are working out in their favor with the new seal for shipments of grain fOr export . Indications at that the worst is over for them .
