Just Suppose was , some years ago , a play about a mythical Prince of Wales . He came to this country , fell in love with one of our loveliest , and was denied the right to marry her because of the exacting demands of royalty . But in the cinema ( you have guessed it ) he does marry her . England need not be alarmed . The Prince and his kingdom are mythical . And Richard Barthelmess does not resemble the renowned Edward Albert . Not that it matters particularly , since the picture is pretty dull . <P> Hands Up . Famous players nave taken their newest comedian and wound him round with a Civil War burlesque . The action is somewhat mischievously placed in Utah , and Brigham Young and most of his wives are added for eccentric complication . The comedian is Raymond Griffith and the play has a double happy-ending . Thanks to the proximity of Salt Lake City , the hero is permitted to marry both his sweethearts .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
