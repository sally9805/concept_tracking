Idleness Breeds Immorality As long as men are busily engaged in some legitimate occupation , immorality is not likely to be present . Virtue gave place to immoral conduct in Rome when large numbers of citizens became wealthy enough to remain idle . 573 . Break the Child 's Will " Break your child 's will in order that it may not perish . Break its will as soon as it can speak plainly ? or even before it can speak at all . It should be forced to do as it is told , even if you have to whip it ten times running . Break its will , in order that its soul may live . " 574 .

" 575 . Give the Child No Liberty " He that loveth his son will continue to lay stripes upon him , that he may have joy of him in the end . He that chastiseth his son shall have profit of him , and shall glory of him among his acquaintance . . . . He that maketh too much of his son shall bind up his wounds ; and his heart will be troubled at every cry . An unbroken horse becometh stubborn : and a son left at large becometh headstrong . Cocker thy child , and he shall make thee // afraid ; play with him , and he will grieve thee . Laugh not with him , lest thou have sorrow with him ; and thou shalt gnash thy teeth in the end .

Chastise thy son , and take pains with him , lest his shameless behaviour be an offence unto thee . " 576 . Duty Shall Act as the Guide " It is always said that everything should be presented to children in such a manner that they will do it from inclination . Without doubt this is good in many cases ; but there is also much that must be prescribed for them as duty . This will be of very great value during their whole life ; for , in public duties , in the labors of an office , and in many other instances , duty alone , not inclination , can guide us . Even if we suppose that the child does not perceive the duty , it is none the less better if he be given the idea of it . . . . " To do anything for the sake of duty means to obey reason . It is useless to speak of duty to ( young ) children . They come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is followed by the rod . The child could be guided by his instincts alone ; but as soon as he begins to develop , the idea of duty must be added . " Fear and Pain the Essence of True Life " A life absolutely free from pain and fear would , so long as we are what we are , soon become insipid and intolerable . For if the causes of pain were eliminated , life would be devoid of all danger , conflict , and failure , exertion and struggle , the love of adventure , the longing for battle , the triumph of victory ; all would be gone . // Life would be pure satisfaction without obstacles , success without resistance . We should grow as tired of all this as we do of a game which we know we are going to win . What chess-player would be willing to play with an opponent whom he knows he will beat ? What hunter would enjoy a chase in which he had a chance to shoot at every step he took , and every shot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are as necessary in a game , if it is to interest and satisfy us , as good luck and victory . " 578 . Inhibition Interferes with Mental Development " If inhibition be imposed upon the child too early , it will interfere with his mental development . In the early years , especially , mind functions to direct action ; and if the latter is impossible , there is no incentive to the former . Static education should have no place at any period in the pupil 's life , but it is particularly ineffective in the kindergarten and elementary school . Action is necessary , in the first place , for the development of cerebral motor areas , upon which the development of the sensory and associative area seems to depend in some measure . Further , the child can acquire a genuine understanding of a thing only as he has motor experience with it , as he does something with it . Eye and ear knowledge alone are of little profit . However , as the pupil develops , past motor experiences may apperceptively give him understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ; but we must be sure that he has had motor experience with similar situations . " 579 . The Child 's Personality and Character Should Be Studied " The modern school child is passed through an almost daily gamut of physical inspections ; scrupulous attention is given to individual fragments of his anatomy , ? to his tonsils and adenoids , to the condition of his skin , his weight , his eyes ? but until recently scant attention has been given to the whole child himself , ? // to the tout ensemble , ? to his personality and character . And when , in spite of these useful and important physical safeguards , he becomes a truant , or , perhaps , steals or lies or runs away a sufficient number of times , we are prone to wash our hands of him , call him a stubborn child , ' feeling that all possible has been done to make his body normal , and invoke the majesty of the law as a preliminary to the reform ' school . The why ' of his conduct disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily ascertained fact that he may possess an ignorant or defective mother lacking barest fundamentals of child-training , or , perhaps , that like Topsy ' he just grew ' in an environment of perpetual wrangling , dishonesty and lack of control , remains undiscovered through lack of knowledge of how important such factors are . " Massachusetts Department of Health , The Commonhealth , March ? April , 1922 , p. 40. 580 . Normal Interests Crowd Out Undesirable Sex Problems " It is important that a certain amount of knowledge regarding sex and social hygiene be properly integrated with other subjects and given to older children , but it should be emphasized that school systems have even a more important task to fulfill in insuring that the lives of children are so filled with normal interests that the abnormal and undesirable are crowded out . If a well rounded and supervised program of exercise and recreations is provided , if physical defects are corrected and good health habits are formed , and if the school plant is so built and supervised that the children may fully express themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never arise . " 581 . Suppression of Impulses " In the career of any impulse activity there are , speaking generally , three possibilities . It may find a surging , explosive dis304 HEALTH AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION charge blind , unintelligent . It may be sublimated ? that is , become a factor coordinated intelligently with others in a continuing course of action . . . . Or again a released impulsive activity may be neither immediately expressed in isolated spasmodic action , nor indirectly employed in an enduring interest . It may be suppressed . ' " Suppression is not annihilation . Psychic ' energy is no more capable of being abolished than the forms we recognize as physical . If it is neither exploded nor converted , it is turned inwards , to lead a surreptitious , subterranean life . An isolated or spasmodic manifestation is a sign of immaturity , crudity , savagery ; a suppressed activity is the cause of all kinds of intellectual and moral pathology . One form of the resulting pathology constitutes reaction ' in the sense in which the historian speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Puritan restraint . A striking modern instance is the orgy of extravagance following upon the enforced economies and hardships of war , the moral let-down after its high-strung exalted idealisms , the deliberate carelessness after an attention too intense and too narrow . Outward manifestation of many normal activities had been suppressed . They were merely dammed up awaiting their chance . " Now such reactions ' are simultaneous as well as successive . Resort to artificial stimulation , to alcoholic excess , sexual debauchery , opium and narcotics are examples . Impulses and interests that are not manifested in the regular course of serviceable activity or in recreation demand and secure a special manifestation . And it is interesting to note that there are two opposite forms . Some phenomena are characteristic of persons engaged in a routine monotonous life of toil attended with fatigue and hardship . And others are found in persons who are intellectual and executive , men whose activities are anything but monotonous , but are narrowed through over-specialization . Such men think too much , that is , too much along a particular line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their offices of service are not adequately shared with others . They seek relief by escape into a more sociable and easy-going world . The imperative demand for companionETHICAL // ship not satisfied in ordinary activity is met by convivial indulgence . The other class has recourse to excess because its members have in ordinary occupations next to no opportunity for imagination . They make a foray into a more highly colored world as a substitute for a normal exercise of invention , planning and judgment . Having no regular responsibilities , they seek to recover an illusion of potency and of social recognition by an artificial exaltation of their submerged and humiliated selves . " Hence the love of pleasure against which moralists issue so many warnings . Not that love of pleasures is in itself in any way demoralizing . Love of the pleasures of cheerfulness , of companionship is one of the steadying influences in conduct . But pleasure has often become identified with special thrills , excitations , ticklings of sense , stirrings of appetite for the express purpose of enjoying the immediate stimulation irrespective of results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the literal sense . An activity which is deprived of regular stimulation and normal function is piqued into isolated activity , and the result is division , dis-association . A life of routine and of over-specialization in non-routine lines seeks occasions in which to arose by abnormal means a feeling of satisfaction without any accompanying objective fulfilment . Hence , as moralists have pointed out , the insatiable character of such appetites . Activities are not really satisfied , that is , fulfilled in objects . They continue to seek for gratification in more intensified stimulations . Orgies of pleasure-seeking , varying from saturnalia to mild sprees , result . " 582 . Experiences Govern Education " In the widest sense of the word a man is educated , either for good or evil , by everything that he experiences from the cradle to the grave . But in the more limited and usual sense , the term education is confined to the efforts made of set purpose to train men in a particular way ? the efforts of the grown-up part of the community to inform the intellect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially to the leaders of professional educators or schoolmasters. " 583 . Values in Character Training " The values of physical education in character training bulk large , because natural big-muscle activities are the out-croppings of the most fundamental instincts and emotions in human nature . " 584 . Bismarck on the Significance of Training " The German child when handed over to the teacher is like a blank sheet of paper , and all that is written upon a child during the course of elementary education is written with indelible ink and will last through life . The soul of a child is like wax . Therefore he who directs the school directs the country 's future . " 585 . Education a Process of Selection and Coordination of Native Activities " All education forms character , mental and moral , but formation consists in the selection and coordination of native activities so that they may utilize the subject matter of the social environment . Moreover , the formation is not only a formation of native activities , but it takes place through them . It is a process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Training " Education has for its object the formation of character . . . . Those , therefore , who advocate the use of authority , and if need be ? force in the management of children , must do so because they think these the best means of compassing the desired object ? // formation of character . . . . Suppose an amiable little urchin is pursuing his own gratification regardless of the comfort of others ? is perhaps annoyingly vociferous in his play ? . . . Paternity , with knit brows , and in a severe tone , commands desistance ? . . . if need be , hints at a whipping . . . ? and complacently resumes the newspaper under the impression that all is as it should be : most unfortunate mistake ! " If the thing wanted had been the mere repression of noise , or the mechanical transfer of a plaything , perhaps , no better course could have been pursued . Had it been of no consequence under what impulse the child acted , so long as it fulfilled a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else was needed . Character was the thing to be changed rather than conduct . It was not the deeds , but the feeling from which the deeds sprung that required dealing with . . . . What , then , was the thing wanted ? Evidently an alteration in the child 's disposition . What was the problem to be solved ? Clearly to generate a state of mind which , had it previously existed , would have prevented the offending actions . What was the final end to be achieved ? Unquestionably the formation of a character which should spontaneously produce greater generosity of conduct . Or , speaking definitely , it was necessary to strengthen that sympathy to the weakness of which this ill behavior was traceable . " But sympathy can be strengthened only by exercise . No faculty however will grow save by the performance of its special function ? a muscle by contraction : the intellect by perceiving and thinking ; a moral sentiment by feeling . Sympathy , therefore , can be increased only by exciting sympathetic emotions . A selfish child is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fellow-feeling with the desires of others . If this is not done , nothing is done . " SPENCER , Social Statics , p. 201. 587 . The School Is Responsible for Social Attitudes " The same considerations enter into conduct in the daily school life and at school entertainments . If dancing is permitted , no // impropriety in position or movement must be tolerated . The hearty cooperation of boy and girl leaders through their pride in keeping personal and school standards high , is necessary if dancing is to be free from offense , and this is difficult to secure if parents do not insist upon propriety at entertainments outside the school . This is a matter for serious consideration by parent-teachers ' associations , and thoughtless mothers and fathers must have the effect of their everybody does it ' tolerance brought home to them . Girls must be taught that their boy friends get indelible impressions from them , and the boy whose school associations do not teach him respect for women , learns the lesson badly afterwards . The girl whose school days do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought and actions of men , will not easily grow into right-minded womanhood . Nor must the burden of responsibility be placed on the girl alone . The boy must be taught that he is responsible for the girl 's point of view and that in consenting to a lowering of her standards he cheapens and degrades his own manhood . " 588 . Transfer of Characteristics " The large principle involved here is illustrated , I think , in the effect of athletic experience , as a form of motor exercise , upon the intellectual and moral life . It is a matter of common belief that a man may face death on the battlefield without flinching , but conduct himself like a child in the dentist 's chair . It is reported that in a recent football game some of the leading men in the team that was defeated lost control of themselves emotionally , and bawled for hours afterward . It is quite common to hear of athletes breaking down when they have lost a game ; the physical courage bred on the athletic field does not stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not help them out . A man who has little courage in the rush line often has enough philosophic courage to stand defeat heroically in the ordinary situations of life . Again , every one has known men of great physical // valor who would almost forget their names through fright when they arose to address their fellow-citizens . On the other hand , men who would without a tremor face an audience would not face a center rush in a football match under any conditions . Pugilists must have a great stock of brute courage , but can they use this in the social , moral , and intellectual situations in which they are placed ? A certain quondam champion pugilist of the world is to-day nothing but a common drunk and street brawler . It is not recorded that in the class room in college or in the affairs of life outside , the crack athlete is any more honest or frank or quick or patient under tribulations than the rest of men . " 589 . Experience Is the Keynote of Character Training " Man has nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he comes to only through experience . All his thinking , be it loose or scientific , common or transcendental , starts from experience ultimately in view . Nothing has unconditional value and significance except life . All other thinking , conception , knowledge has value only in so far as in some way or other it refers to the fact of life , starts from it , and has in view a subsequent return to it . " 590 . Moral Training " All activities both in school and out of school have character and moral-training values . All are expressions of character in some degree . All present moral situations that require moral responses at least occasionally . The moral training value of each depends upon instinct mechanisms and what emotions it exercises and the opportunity it gives the group leader to direct the response tendencies according to moral standards . " // 591 . Schools as Workshops " What has to be done must be learned by practice . Artisans do not detail their apprentices with theories , but set them to do practical work at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to carve by carving , to paint by painting , and to dance by dancing . In schools , therefore , let the students learn to write by writing , to talk by talking , to sing by singing and to reason by reasoning . In this way schools will become workshops humming with work , and students whose efforts prove successful will experience the truth of the proverb : We give form to ourselves and to our materials at the same time . ' " 592 . Teaching of Morality Comes as a By-Product " He ( the teacher ) does not preach morality , but strives in every school activity to develop the habit of morality in his pupils . To this end the school is a moral laboratory and every lesson helps to groove morality into a habit of life . There is no formal teaching of morals , for he knows that the incidental way is far more effective . Somehow his pupils come to feel that honor is the quality that reveals itself in the conduct of a person when he is alone ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another ; that honesty is not a mere sentiment but a basic working principle of life ; and that service has a wholesome broadening and deepening influence upon those who serve . By way of reinforcing this notion of service he has a motto on the blackboard to this effect ? Success begins at the point where a man stops asking favors and starts giving them ' ? and this motto needs no interpretation from the teacher . He disparages fighting and in the next breath declares that the boy who will not fight for the good name of his mother or the honor of his country is n't much of a boy and will not become much of a man . In this way he proves to them that morality is not a mere surface veneer , not a mere convention , but sends its roots down deep into the tissues of life . The primary purpose of the Scout movement is to groove morality into a habit , // and we shall put a crown of glory upon our work if , as teachers , we strive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and the playground a means toward this end of inculcating the habit of morality . " 593 . Health an Index to Morals " The health of a community is an almost unfailing index to its morals . " ? MARTINEAU. 594 . Character Habits Must Be Lived " Such character qualities as truthfulness , fair play , magnanimity , loyalty , chivalry , and control of temper , which we so glibly boast of as resulting from the activities on the athletic field , are not developed by occasional administering or lecturing any more than are posture and health habits by means of textbooks and informational talks . These character and health habits have to be earned and lived in order to be possessed . " 595 . Habits and Attitudes More Important than Knowledge " Character depends upon the practice of moral habits rather than learning ethical precepts . Cheating on the play field or in the shop means moral degeneracy . Ethical knowledge does not necessarily mean virtue . The foundations of character are not to be found in the intellect but in the emotions and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Habits Early in Life " Only the man who can maintain a correct posture has the stuff out of which to form that idea of standing erect which can // be the starting point of a right act . Only the man whose habits are already good can know what the good is. " 597 . Form Good Habits " While it may be never too late to mend ' bad health habits , it is never too early to form good ones . " ? HAVILAND. 598 . Good vs . Bad Habits " It is just as easy to form a good habit as a bad one . It is just as hard to break a good habit as a bad one . Therefore get the good ones and keep them . " ? MCKINLEY. 599 . How to Overcome Bad Habits " But when the proposed end involves any deviation from usual action , or any rectification of it ? as in the case of standing straight ? then the main thing is to find some act which is different from the usual one . The discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which we must devote all attention . Otherwise we shall simply do the old thing over again , no matter what is our conscious command . The only way of accomplishing this discovery is through a flank movement . We must stop even thinking of standing up straight . To think of it is fatal , for it commits us to the operation of an established habit of standing wrong . We must find an act within our power which is disconnected from any thought about standing . We must start to do another customary thing which on one side inhibits our falling into the customary bad position and on the other side is the beginning of a series of acts which may lead into the correct posture . The hard drinker who keeps thinking of not drinking is doing what he can to initiate the acts which lead to drinking . He is starting with the stimulus to his habit . To succeed he must find some posiETHICAL // tive interest or line of action which will inhibit the drinking series and which by instituting another course of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man 's true aim is to discover some course of action having nothing to do with the habit of drink or standing erect , which will take him where he wants to go . " 600 . Character Training in Schools Thesis I. " Character is a synthesis of simpler units ; it is developed through two sets of closely allied processes : " I. The modification of the original reflexes which the child has at birth in such a way that these may fit together harmoniously into the kind of synthetic product ( character ) which the experiences and reflection of the race have determined as most desirable . This procedure is peculiarly the character-education belonging to infancy and earliest childhood , when primary habits and satisfactions are established . " 2 . The gradual synthesis of the modified reflexes developed in the first period into a more complex organization of character . This includes development of feelings , tastes , ideals , attitudes , and purposes as a means of securing self-direction and self-control , without which real character is impossible . This process is the task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to do with moulding the vital units of which character is formed ; the second has to do with assimilating these units into a larger mental complex in conformity with approved standards of character . Guidance of these processes calls for clear conception of the objectives of character education , on the one hand , and thorough , scientific knowledge of childhood , on the other . Thesis II . " The content and method of the various subjects of the curriculum should be so selected and organized as to provide systematically for development of those purposes , ideas , attitudes , tastes , and feelings that make for development of the most ideal character . // " In primary and intermediate schools or junior high schools , this aim can be accomplished , for the most part , through studies in hygiene and sanitation , natural science , civics , biography , history , geography , literature , and the content selected for practice in oral and written composition . The same means may be employed in senior high school , supplemented by systematic study of ethical principles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should make provision in one or more of its required courses for thorough study of the scientific and ethical principles relating to the family as an institution . Different phases of this subject may be distributed between two or more courses . These phases should include heredity and eugenics , influence of sex upon the development of the individual , both physically and spiritually ; the social purpose of the family ; conditions of successful family life , including economics of the family group ; and the rearing and training of children . The last named topic may be used as a successful means of moral instruction of youth through study of parental responsibilities ? more successful , perhaps , than such instruction might be were it aimed directly at the youth . Thesis III . " Since the activities of the school ( the personal and social relations of teachers and pupils ; the athletics and sports ; the general recreational life ; the literary , musical , artistic , or other interests ; the efforts of the school to take part in community life ; and the methods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these things ) are closer to life itself than any curricular work can be made , these activities do much more than the curriculum can ever do to develop inductively the character of pupils . " Therefore , if the general life of the school is to make the best contribution to character , this life should be studied , reorganized , perfected , and supervised , with the active and democratic participation of both the pupils and the teachers . This should be done at least as thoroughly and scientifically as the organization of the curriculum itself . Thesis IV . " The basic method in character education , as in science itself , should be inductive , passing from experience to // principles , rather than deductive ? that is , ordering the particulars of conduct by instruction , precepts , and principles which are entirely arbitrary from the point of view of the child . The inductive method in character education follows this general order : " 1 . Conditioning the native reflexes and the feelings and actions involved in them by modifying either the stimuli which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or both , thus encouraging : " 2 . The formation of habits of action both of the more routine type in which the milder motives of conformity , imitation and ease of adjustment are involved , and those habits where more intense and even conflicting emotions operate ; " 3 . The building of definite tastes and preferences in relation to all phases of experience , such as various types of stimuli , of actions , and of satisfactions . Tastes and preferences also describe habits , but relate to elements remaining in character rather than to avert action ; " 4 . The development of ideas and intellectual discriminations in respect to these various types of experience ; and , finally , " 5 . Organizing principles , standards of choice and action in the light of the whole process . " Nevertheless , the inductive and deductive methods can and should be combined to this extent : the experienced guide and teacher of youth may in some degree select and control the youth 's life ? experiences on the basis of their teaching value ; may abbreviate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by inspiration may accelerate the inductive process ? all without in any way depriving the pupil of the full advantages of the method . Neither in the scientific laboratory nor in life is it necessary for each individual to experience all the concourse of particulars in order to apply the scientific method effectively . Indeed no human progress beyond one generation is possible unless some such use can be made of past experience of others in short-circuiting present experience . Thesis V. " While in all probability the emotional and social capacities vary as do the intellectual , and have their limits in each individual , if there is enough intelligence to insure the simpler mental processes we have no evidence that we have approached the // field ranks as the greatest moral force in the university . Certain it is that the department of physical training has done more to preserve sane morals among college students than any other influence . " STAGG , 605 . The Chief Contribution of Physical Education " The error often made is to think of play and athletics as a means of physical training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief contribution . They should be hygienic , but if a man 's soul is ennobled and his leg broken , we are interested greatly in the former , but little in the latter . The proper emphasis in this connection was given by Theodore Roosevelt when he said : I have no sympathy whatever with the overwrought sentimentality which would keep a young man in cotton wool , and I have a hearty contempt for him if he counts a broken arm or collar bone as of serious consequence , when balanced against the chance of showing that he possesses hardihood , physical address , and courage . ' " 606 . Games Promote Equality " One characteristic of a game is that the players are in certain important respects on terms of equality . This does not mean that different abilities to play the game do not have much to do with the playing , nor that , in the division of labor among the players , some may not be captains or otherwise assigned a dominating part . But it means that inequalities extraneous to the game are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not play out of turn , ' but every one must have an equal chance to do as well as he can . Not infrequently , a child will undertake to assert himself and have everything his own way ; but he is resisted by the others , on the ground that such behavior spoils the game and is no fair . ' Rules of the game ' grow up , with the object , in part , of enforcing // equality between the players , and , more generally , with the object of insuring a good game . " 607 . Dance Music and Emotions " Music exerts a profound influence upon our emotions and has the power of actually creating and manipulating mental atmospheres . Its capacity for good or evil in the dance hall is great and requires tactful supervision . Careful selection of high class , popular music will help to create a good atmosphere and be a strong influence in maintaining the healthfulness and innocence of the dance . It is recommended , therefore , that the music be arranged by the director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or printed program will solve many of the problems of selection . " 608 . Dancing as a Form of Recreation " The conventional type of modern social dancing ( i.e. couple dancing ) makes a complex appeal to the aesthetic and the emotional natures of those participating . The aesthetic element is obviously wholesome , but when the emotional appeal becomes so intense as to stimulate those emotions which are fundamentally related to the sex-instinct , social dancing is no longer wholesome . It is therefore recommended that all those factors in dancing which in any way over-stimulate the emotions be eliminated , as far as possible . " While dancing offers great possibilities for the cultivation of grace , refinement , and many other aesthetic qualities , it is nevertheless the most dangerous and most easily perverted social pastime unless adequately supervised . It is therefore recommended that the church provide adequate supervision on all occasions when dances are given under its auspices or in any of its buildings . // 6 . What is a moral person ? Can you think of any one among your acquaintances who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems best adapted to ethical and character education of children ? 7 . Should ethics and character appear as teacher aims or pupil aims , or both ? Should this aim or objective be consciously striven for at all ? 8 . Set up in detail a plan for teaching ethics to a particular group of high-school students . 9 . Can character education be taught more effectively by the inductive or deductive methods ? Why ? 10 . What has character education to do with social progress ? Explain by using illustrations . 11 . Is there evidence to indicate a high correlation between intelligence and social characteristics ? Are both equally susceptible to education ? CHAPTER X PLAY 611 . Theories of Play " One theory is that advanced by Schiller and Spencer , the claim that the excess energy of brain centres discharges into play activities . It is because the child has superabundance of energy that he plays . It is no doubt true that a well , healthy , rested child plays better than a sick , frail , tired one ; but we know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and play until they are exhausted . What , then , constitutes excess ' of energy ? This theory , also , does not account for the particular forms taken by play . There must be some reason for the fact that children between seven and eight enjoy make-believe ' games , and that between nine and eleven the running games are so popular ; and that the puzzle is fascinating at about twelve , and games of skill of extraordinary interest in the teens . In other words , there must be some reason for the fact that the play activities of children follow a certain order irrespective of environment , and this explanation the Spencer theory does not give . " The theory advanced by Professor Groos is that play is a preparation for the business of life . He thinks that in the various plays children practice the forms of activity that they will later need and upon which their struggle for existence may depend ; that such practice is necessary for the future perfection of the various activities , and that development of the individual depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one considers primitive man , there is some such correspondence ; but in most cases the preparatory effect of the various games is hard to trace . For instance , it might seem valuable to children of uncivilized races to indulge as they do in the running , catching games , because the adult savage depends largely on his agility and strength for his existence ; but 323 // for what do these plays prepare a civilized child ? For catching a street car perhaps , or getting out of the way of an automobile . The preparation , if there is one , must be taken in a very general sense , for no close correspondence can be found . Even if it does exist , as the theory suggests , it but indicates something further to be explained , for Why does the child in his ignorance of adult needs react in just those ways which do thus train him ? The explanation needs itself to be explained . ' " Stanley Hall holds strongly to the atavistic theory , which is but a special application of the recapitulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor habits and spirit of the past of the race , persisting in the present , as rudimentary functions sometimes of and always akin to rudimentary organs . The best index and guide to the stated activities of adults in past ages is found in the instinctive , untaught and non-imitative plays of children which are the most spontaneous and exact expressions of their motor needs . . . . Thus we rehearse the activities of our ancestors , back we know not how far , and repeat their life work in summative and adumbrated ways . ' The same criticisms of the recapitulation theory already discussed will apply to this special application of it . Theoretically , scientists do not believe that human nature has undergone such definite and well-marked changes due to the stages of culture through which it has passed . Practically , it is difficult on this theory to explain why boys like to go swimming and to live in caves at the same age , or why it is that children enjoy playing with toy boats and trains before they want a bow and arrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the doll . That there are common elements to be found in the plays of all children , whether civilized or primitive , there can be no question , but the explanation is probably not the one Dr. Hall supports . " Professor McDougall in his Social Psychology , after reviewing the various theories of play , suggests that the essence of playful activity is found in the motive of rivalry or emulation . He said , A motive that may cooperate with others in almost all games , and which among ourselves is seldom altogether lacking , is the desire to get the better of others , to emulate , to excel . This motive plays // an important part , not only in games , but in many of the most serious activities of life , to which it gives an additional zest . . . . But wherever it enters in , it is recognized that it imparts something of a playful character to the activity . ' But rivalry does not enter into many of the plays of children . Some plays , the make-believe plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infant are noticeably lacking in such an element . Moreover , the presence of rivalry when two individuals or corporations are fighting for the upper hand by no means changes their activity into a playful one . If carried out fully , this suggestion would involve a differentiation of each instinct into two , ? one the serious form , and the other the playful form which is always accompanied by the spirit of rivalry , and this does not seem to be true . It seems impossible , then , to take this theory as a full explanation of the play impulse , although of course it has an element of truth in it . " Miss Appleton , in her comparative study of play already referred to , advances a biological theory of play . She thinks that play is dependent on the structure of the body , and that the activity is of such character as will satisfy the needs of the growing body . With the infant , the head or arm muscles being strongest , control the somatic type of play , together with the developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sensations , coming through the sheen of light , the shake of the rattle , the throwing of the ball , are his mental toys and his delight . Later , when stronger muscles cooperate in stronger and more complex movements and when further brain development makes perception and apperceptions possible , activity of the whole body is the somatic type , while mentally imagination , volition , and imitation become his toys . And so we hear , " Tell me a story , " and see , a little later , the story epitomized in dramatic representation . . . is it not significant that whatever the type of play may be , it just keeps pace with the type of somatic growth ? And does not the impulse to exercise these growing parts furnish all the explanation that is needed for the existence of the play activity ? ' " // 612 . The Theory of Surplus Energy " The first explanation of play to receive general following was the theory advanced almost simultaneously by Schiller and Spencer and which is known as the Surplus Energy Theory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions of life become easier , so that an animal does not need to expend all its energy in getting a living , it uses this surplus in play , and that play is in general the expression of the energy left over after the necessities of life have been satisfied . The engine that is drawing its train , between stations uses its power on the load ; but when it is standing still , it soon begins to blow off steam . Play is this surplus for the boy . He has to find an escape for it , or the boiler will blow up . " 613 . One Theory of Play " One theory is play is practicing in childhood activities that will be necessary in mature years ' ; thus the kitten plays to prepare it for rat catching ' ; another theory is that in play one is rehearsing the activities of the race in the past , and still another is surplus energy . ' " 614 . Professor Groos 's Theory : Play as a Method of Education " The next theory to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Groos of Gorlitz , Germany . He held that play was an instinct that came into the world to serve the purpose of education . IIe says that the animal does not play because it is young , but it rather has a period of infancy in order that it may play , and in that play may be prepared for its life activities . In the lower forms of life the animal can do the first day of its existence anything that the adult animal can do , and among these lower forms there is no play . As we go up the biological scale , the conditions become more and more complex , and it becomes impossible for the animal to do without training the things // that life requires ; and whenever that occurs in the animal series , there play comes in as the method of education . He gives many examples of this . The kitten springs upon flying leaves and rolling balls , and in that play it gets just the training that enables the adult cat to catch mice . The puppy runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neck ; he wrestles with him , he fights with him , and in this way he gets the training which enables the adult dog to kill his game . In the same way the little girl plays with her doll . Who shall say that this play at keeping house and caring for her baby is not as good preparation for her future life as wife and mother as the lessons in arithmetic or geography ? The Indian boy plays at tag and hide-and-seek , and so learns to catch game . He shoots and throws at a mark , and so he learns to kill it . His play is directly preparatory to the life that is before him . " 615 . G. Stanley Hall 's Emphasis on the Recapitulation Theory " Professor Groos gave us the essential elements of the modern theory of play , but he apparently failed to realize the full significance of instinct or how any activity might become instinctive . Dr. Hall has supplemented the theory of Groos by saying that all games are remnants of the earlier activities of the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . This is , in fact , only a statement of what instinct ' itself means , for all instincts are activities that have been practiced for unnumbered generations . " 616 . Argument against Recapitulation Theory " Others , looking chiefly at the play of children , have regarded their play as a special instance of the operation of the law of recapitulation ; and they have sought to show that the child retraverses in his play the successive culture periods of human history , owing to the successive development of ripening of native tendencies to // the forms of activity supposed to have been characteristic of these periods . This recapitulatory theory of play and the educational practice based on it are founded on the fallacious belief that , as the human race traversed the various culture periods , its native mental constitution acquired very special tendencies , and that each period of culture was , as it were , the expression of a certain well-marked stage in the evolution of the human mind . This view can hardly be accepted , for we have little reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course of the development of civilization out of barbarism and savagery. " 617 . Play as Preparation for Adult Life " Professor Karl Groos has recently propounded a new theory of play . He starts from the consideration of the play of young animals , and he points out the obvious utility to them of play as a preparation for the serious business of life , as a perfecting by practice of the more specialized and difficult kinds of activity on the successful exercise of which their survival in the struggle for existence must depend . Consider the case of the kitten playing with a ball on the floor . It is clear that , in the course of such playing , the kitten improves its skill in movements of the kind that will be needed for the catching of its prey when it is thrown upon its own resources . Or take the case of puppies playfully fighting with one another . It seems clear that the practice they get in quick attack and avoidance must make them better fighters than they would become if they never played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Future Life " Play , like curiosity , is an important factor in the learning process . It , too , has no ulterior motive , but finds satisfaction in its own expression . There are three principal theories in regard to play . Formerly the most commonly expressed theory , the one advanced by Herbert Spencer , held that play is to be explained as the // result of the surplus energy of the organism . Excess vitality leads to movements that have no utilitarian value . More recently Stanley Hall has set forth the theory that play is atavistic ; it is the rehearsal by the organism of certain ancestral activities that no longer possess utility . Doubtless , there is a truth in both of these theories , but the one which is most significant from the standpoint of the psychology of learning maintains that the real philosophy of play is that it is a preparation for future activities . This is the standpoint of Karl Groos , as set forth in his works on the Play of Animals and the Play of Man . Thus play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepares the organism for a future environment to which it must adequately adjust itself for survival and progress . It thus appears that through curiosity and play both the child and the animal are capable of going beyond the immediate and practical environment , in this manner extending their control , so that they shall be better able to cope with those conditions that shall ultimately demand attention . " 619 . Theory of Play In play there must always be some energy which is surplus in the sense that it may be used in other ways than to obtain necessary ends . The activities most readily initiated are of parts that have most available energy , either because they are growing and developing , or are less fatigued than other parts . ? The plays of young animals are therefore greatly influenced by the order in which their powers and instincts develop , and in turn , play promotes the development of powers that will be needed in adult life . 620 . Social Value of Play and Games The great lesson of law as a means of freedom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In no other // place can a child so fully realize for himself the value of law as on the playground . A teacher who can successfully lead children to play happily in accordance with whatever rules are necessary is not only forming a public sentiment in favor of orderly and fair play , but she is also preparing the children for good citizenship more effectually than she can possibly do in the school room , unless the children are led to have as keen a personal interest in what is being done there . . 621 . A Factor in Education In school , where what is to be done and learned is determined by the course of study , there are yet so many ways of doing and learning that it is often possible for the teacher to arrange exercises so that the dominant powers and instincts of the children at each age shall be called into activity in a playful way . With a little ingenuity , the different exercises may be so conducted that much of the play spirit may be incorporated in them . School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary , including word drill , numbers requiring rapidity in fundamental operations , factoring , etc. , and fixing facts of geography , history , and grammar , may be conducted as games rather than as formal drills . 622 . Play Instinct and the Learning Process " The tremendous significance of the play instinct in the learning process has already been touched upon in the preceding pages . It may be added here that in the modification and control of other instincts it serves an important office , since through play the experience of the child may be in imagination extended to those objects which are the ends of other instincts . In play the boy may safely satisfy his instinct for adventure , his hunting and predatory tendencies , his desire for combat and the like . " In the first school years play interests occupy a large part of // the child 's attention . The earliest plays are of the romping variety , full of movement and strikingly like those of animals in their aimless abandon . These plays are largely atavistic in their character , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . In their more organized forms these plays appear in the hunting and fighting impulses of boys , and in the tendency of boys to form gangs and secret clubs of various sorts . The organized plays of girls are more imitative , generally speaking , though they have an evident basis in the maternal instincts . Girls play dolls and house ; boys build forts and play at soldiers and Indians . The later plays are less instinctive in their nature , and their forms are primarily due to the suggestion of the environment . Here belong numerous games , some of them centuries old and but slightly changed in the course of the ages , such is the wonderful conservatism of childhood . In definitely planning plays for educational purposes , we should strive to select those forms of play activity that are spontaneous with children . One of the most serious criticisms that has been brought against the plays of the kindergarten is that children do not play these when they are by themselves . It should further be remembered that too much supervision in play may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is claiming much attention among social workers , may be criticised from this standpoint . " 623 . Points of Agreement " While leading educators are not yet in full accord as to the meaning of play and what should be included in the term , and are therefore not agreed as to its value in education , they are coming more and more to agree on a few fundamental points : " 1 . Play is activity ; it is not idleness , but is in contrast with it . Loafing and dawdling are not play , but a slumping of activity because of lack of interest in it , indicating a loss of the play spirit . " 2 . Play is not limited to any particular form of activity ; it may be neuro-muscular , sensory , mental , or a combination of all three . // " 3 . The value of play in education is due to its power to interest the player , absorb his attention , and arouse him to enthusiastic and persistent activity . Education must be active rather than passive . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the attitude of mind of the doer toward the thing he is doing ? or , to state the same thing in other words , upon the motive that impels him to action . It follows that there is no particular activity , be it baseball , fishing , or playing with dolls , that is always necessarily play ; neither can an activity be mentioned that may not under some conditions be play . If one runs a foot race , drives a car , rows a boat , or reads a book , it may be play or not , depending on the way he thinks and feels about it . Some activities , such as games and sports , are usually play , but we can never be sure that a certain activity is play for a certain person unless we know his mental attitude towards it while he is actually engaged in it . What is play one day may be drudgery another day , for mental attitudes change with conditions . " 5 . There is general accord as regards point ( 4 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , but there is not so full an agreement as to the nature of this attitude . It is , however , coming to be agreed more and more that the essential characteristics of play is a satisfaction in the activity itself . To quote again from Kilpatrick , When the satisfaction inherent in a specific activity suffices to keep it going , it is commonly called play . If , however , some external compulsion or consideration is necessary to the continuance of the activity , some one of the other terms is considered more appropriate . ' This agrees with the definitions given by Spencer , Gulick , and Dewey . " 624 . Play , Imitation , and Construction Play , imitation , and constructiveness are three instincts so closely connected and their significance for the development of // the child so similar and so important that they may be considered together . In little children the impulse to play is practically identical with the impulse to use the voluntary muscles . Indeed , the definition of play which enjoys widest currency at the present moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity of the voluntary muscles . For all periods after those of early childhood , say , subsequent to seven years of age , there is an increasing disposition to contrast play with work and to ascribe to the former a certain lack of seriousness . But with little children this lack of seriousness exists only for the sophisticated onlooker . To the child himself his playing is the " real thing . " It has all the seriousness which the child is able to reflect in his activities at the time . The seemingly contradictory theories of Spencer and Groos are entirely reconcilable and distinctly supplementary to one another . It may be that the impulse to play has its racial significance in the opportunity which it affords for the exercise of those forms of coordinated movement which adult life demands . It may , indeed , owe its preservation in hereditary form to just this circumstance . And it may , nevertheless , be also true that in its expression at any specific time the impulse really represents the tapping of reservoirs of surplus energy . These explanations seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present vitality and utility of the play impulse with adequate genetic and historical causes . 625 . The Play Impulse This unchecked relating and coupling of ideas in imagination is connected with volitional impulses aiming to find for the ideas some starting points in immediate sense-perception . This is what gives rise to the play impulse . The early games of the child are those of pure imagination . ' I'lcose of adults are intellectual . " Only where aesthetical // demands exert an influence are the games of adults the productions of the imagination . " When the play of a child takes its natural course , it shows at different periods of its development all the intermediate stages between the game of pure imagination and that in which imagination and understanding are united . In the first year this play consists in the production of rhythmical movements of the arms and legs , then the movements are carried over to external objects as well . After this , during the first year , play becomes gradually a voluntary imitation of the occupations and scenes that the child sees about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer limited to what is seen , but includes a free reproduction of what is heard in narratives . At the same time the interconnection between ideas and acts begins to follow a more fixed plan . This is the regulative influence of the activity of understanding , which shows itself in the games of later childhood in prescribed rules . This development is often accelerated through the influences of those about the child and through artificial forms of play generally invented by adults and not always suited to the child 's imagination . 626 . Play the Fundamental Impulse " The fundamental impulse or motive to be considered in physical education is play . Those students who study play most carefully give it most serious consideration with reference to its possibilities in the life and education of the child . The more strenuous and intellectual modern life becomes , the more important it appears to be to cultivate the spirit and to provide the chance to play for child and adult . The theories of play are not altogether in agreement , but whether one believes in the Spencer-Schiller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy to express itself , or in imitation or recapitulation theories , or in the Groos theory of instinct , all may agree that the young of animals exhibit the play instinct and that the human child has his full share of it . " PLAY 335 627 . Importance of the Motive " It is obvious that Groos ' theory is applicable to some of the plays of children , especially the warlike and hunting games of boys and the doll-playing of girls . But there are other forms of childish play which can not be accounted for in this way and which are not the direct expressions of instincts . The motives of play are various and often complex , and they can not be characterised in any brief formula ; nor can any hard-and-fast line be drawn between work and play . Beside the class of plays to which Professor Groos ' formula is applicable we may recognize several principal classes of play motives ? such are the desire for increased skill , the pleasure of make-believe , the pleasure in being a cause . But a motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which among ourselves is seldom altogether lacking , is the desire to get the better of others , to emulate , to excel . This motive plays an important part , not only in games , but in many of the most serious activities of life , to which it gives an additional zest . For many a politician it is a principal motive , and many a professional and many a commercial man continues his exertions , under the driving power of this motive , long after the immediate practical ends of his professional activity have been achieved ; and in the collective life of societies it plays no small part . But , wherever it enters in , it is recognized that it imparts something of a playful character to the activity ; a recognition which often finds expression in the phrase playing the game ' applied to activities of the most diverse and serious kinds . " 628 . Play Instincts " I have enumerated what I believe to be the principal play instincts , seven in all ? creation , rhythm , hunting , fighting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think would include all of these ; some would include others that I have omitted . " . // 629 . Certain Instincts Important Only for a Short Period " Climbing is evidently an instinct , and it is important in its day , but it is not one of the continuing impulses upon which the child 's whole life is woven . The same may be said of the impersonating impulse , at least in its most salient form , important as that is during its special period . " 630 . Rivalry the Dominating Influence of Play " I think we may even observe in young boys the recapitulation of the process of differentiation of the impulse of rivalry from the combative instinct . The latter usually comes into play at a very early age , but the former does not usually manifest itself until the age of four or five years . Up to this time the more active playing of boys is apt to be formless and vague , a mere running about and shouting , a form of play sufficiently accounted for by the SchillerSpencer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , and from that time it may dominate the boy 's life more and more , in so far as his activities are spontaneous . In this connection it is important to note that the growth of self-consciousness must favour and strengthen the operation of this impulse , whereas it is rather adverse to the display of most of the other instinctive activities in their crude forms . " 631 . Play the Life and Spirit of Childhood " Play is the life and spirit of childhood , and exercise is only incidental to it . It is no more physical than it is emotional or mental or social . " 632 . Play Is the Child " Play , to grown people , signifies something of secondary importance : it is the word for those activities that must be post- // poned for serious pursuits ? that , except as they may contribute to the successful carrying on of the latter , may be altogether omitted with impunity . Child 's play , ' especially , means whatever is ridiculously easy . To the child , upon the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is primary , comes first in interest , represents real life ; it is what all the rest is for . It is difficult , making an infinite and insatiable demand for power and courage . It is authoritative , required , not to be slighted without shame . Play is the child . In it he wreaks himself . It is the letting loose of what is in him , the active projection of the force he is , the becoming of what he is to be . " 633 . Play and Recreation " There is a very common misunderstanding of the play of children among adults which arises from their confusing it with recreation . Recreation is relief from toil . It is intended for the rest and rebuilding of wearied muscles and nerves and spirit . It may take any form , but it is always lacking in seriousness and usually has value only in re-creating the mind and body for the more serious work of life . The play of the child does not correspond to the recreation of the adult , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious activity in which the child engages . " 634 . Play May Be Good or Bad Play in and of itself may be good or bad . In the first place play that has no motive either external or stimulated by an inner urge is apt to become mere fooling , not attended by the desirable social and moral influences that accrue from carefully directed activity . Again , to forget one 's self utterly in loyalty to the group may be either good or bad . Such group allegiance may become a peril to a community , as for instance in political organizations bent merely upon serving themselves through exploitation of others to the advantage of the group . The duty of education is to provide wise // leadership and supervision during the play periods at least until such a time as pupils are able to apply those ethical ideals which tend toward good citizenship . 635 . Play and Fooling " Children have suffered from the common American idea that play is synonymous with fooling , or is an activity that is not worth while . " Play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disconnected temporary overflows of energy dependent upon whim and accident . When all reference to outcome is eliminated from the sequence of ideas and acts that make play , each member of the sequence is cut loose from every other and becomes fantastic , arbitrary , aimless ; mere fooling follows . There is some inveterate tendency to fool in children as well as in animals ; nor is the tendency wholly evil , for at least it militates against falling into ruts . But when it is excessive in amount , dissipation and disintegration follow ; and the only way of preventing this consequence is to make regard for results enter into even the freest play activity . " Play as a Training for Life Work " The plays and games of childhood present ever-varying conditions , constituting both mental and physical problems of the highest educational value . The child is habituated to make rapid judgments in the face of ever-changing conditions . He must be constantly on the alert , must perceive conditions as they are , must immediately adapt his own action to their quick-changing relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect control of his body which serves him throughout life . ? As teachers we must consider that . . . the judgments upon which all the active movements are // based are intellectual operations . ? In play the child is the unit of force ; he initiates his own conditions . His limitations are selfimposed . His self-control lies in execution rather than in inhibition . He is concerned with self-expression rather than with selfrepression . Play thus relates itself to the truest conception of education , the development of the power of the individual to act as a self-directed unit in the community . " 638 . Play and Mental Habit " All educators are agreed that the chief purpose of education is the acquiring of an alertness of mind and right mental habits . The attitude of mind which is found in play is the attitude which represents the greatest efficiency in all mental effort ; for in all good play there is a complete absorption in the thing at hand , entire forgetfulness of self , and the intuitive following of spirit guidance which leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in this spirit becomes an art . The person who goes forward into mature life carrying into his work this same selfforgetfulness , this same absorption in the activity in hand , this same unconscious following of the guidance of the spirit , will be a poet , an artist , a genius ; for these all are essentially grown-up children who have preserved to mature years the simplicity and spontaneity of the child . " 639 . Without Play the Child Will Not Grow Up " Play is thus the essential part of education . It is nature 's prescribed course . School is invaluable in forming the child , to meet actual social opportunities and conditions . Without the school he will not grow up to fit our institutions . Without play he will not grow up at all . " . // 640 . The Function of Play " The function of play in growth is , then , to realize the potential body , and to supplement the impulses which the major instincts give in general terms by habits and reflexes , making them efficient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion has been stated already in part . The individual is more completely revealed in play than in any other way ; and conversely , play has a greater shaping power over the character and nature of man than has any one other activity . A man shows what he really is when he is free to do what he chooses , and if a person can be influenced so that his highest aspirations ? which are followed when he is free to pursue his ideals ? are a gain , then character is being shaped profoundly . " Play Exercises Fix Habits for Life " A major advantage of the play-exercise is that it can fix habits for life . Adults in a sedentary age need physical exercises as much as children and adolescents . The training should prepare them for this . But adults in their recreations refuse the taskmaster and all his ways . They will have spontaneity or nothing . If their training has given them command over a variety of sports , games , and athletics , and has developed appreciations and habits , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they will not continue formal gymnastics . Even though it may have accomplished the development of youth , it fails to meet the continuing needs of adulthood . We are prone to forget that education is for adult life ; and that it can not be accomplished once for all time , but must be a life-long continuing affair . " PLAY 341 643 . Play as a Foundation for Education " It may be justly claimed that the child gains more educationally in the first eight or ten years of his life and lays a surer foundation for the mental and physical health of after life through vigorous , unrestricted physical activity than through any other factor whatsoever . By this I mean spontaneous play under favorable conditions , with accompanying fresh air , sunshine , and good food , supplemented and enriched by gymnastics and athletics , including swimming . I do not mean that nervously exhausting and deadening drill known as the Swedish Gymnastics which , in the name of educational gymnastics , adds fatigue to fatigue by taking the initiative away from the child and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders of the teacher , that he may execute with precision entirely uninteresting and conventional movements . " 644 . Play Play is not to be identified with anything which the child externally does . It rather designates his mental attitude in its entirety and in its unity . Negatively , it is freedom from economic pressure ? the necessity for getting a living and supporting others ? and from the fixed responsibilities attaching to the special callings of the adult . Positively , it means that the supreme end of the child is fullness of growth ? fullness of realization of his budding powers , a realization which continually carries him on from one plane to another . The applications of these principles to teaching means a change in general procedure , especially in the kindergarten and lower grades . If play denotes the psychological attitude of the child , rather than his outward performances , teachers can no longer cling to any prescribed system or sequence of gifts , plays , and occupations . The teacher must select those activities which are vital to the children with whom she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind the question ? " Will the proposed activity give that sort of expression to those impulses that will carry the child on to a higher plane of consciousness and action , instead of merely exciting him and then leaving him just where he was before , plus a certain amount of nervous exhaustion and appetite for more excitement in the future ? " Principles of large import are involved in plays of children . These activities are not trivial because done by children , but are essential factors in their growth . The peculiar problem of the early grades is , of course , to get hold of the child 's natural impulses and instincts , and to utilize them so that the child is carried on to a higher plane of perception and judgment , and equipped with more efficient habits ; so that he has an enlarged and deepened consciousness , and increased control of powers of action . Wherever this result is not reached , play results in mere amusement and not in educative growth . 645 . Underlying Principles of Play " The individualistic tendency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his activity program . It should always be possible for him to carry his play to the point of satisfaction by himself or with as small an amount of dependence upon someone else as possible . His span of attention and interest is comparatively short , for he easily becomes discouraged ; consequently it should be possible for him to reach the point of satisfaction quickly and without too great an effort . " As he grows older he grows more gregarious and should have an opportunity to play with the gang and feel that he is one of them . At this time , up to junior high , he is not a socially inclined being except with his chosen few and should not be expected to play from any altruistic motives , or to have much consideration for anything or anybody outside of his whole-hearted activity . This activity can lead with equal ease into destructive or constructive channels and at this period ? grades four , five , and six ? the wisest // and most sympathetic leadership is needed . At least up to and including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the big fundamental type and should not need careful adjustment of the child to any piece of apparatus . Two extremes along this line are kicking a foot ball and driving a golf ball . " In the seventh , eighth , and ninth grades the social qualities are more developed and the type of games changes toward higher organization and more concerted team play . " As we grow still older the element of skill is increased , as in tennis and golf . " There is great similarity in lists of games for junior and senior high schools but the degree of skill differs and the method of teaching is far less detailed for the younger group . " Throughout the whole of life ( under normal conditions ) rational exercise is essential . It is therefore necessary in childhood and in youth to establish habits of rational physical activity , and even more important , to create such an interest in and enjoyment of those activities that in adult life the individual will arrange his daily schedule to include a desirable amount , even at the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teach Children by Children " The second kind of play is the playing of children with children . . . . On the play-place ( playground ) they first issue from the speaking and audience hall into the true sphere of action , and begin their human praxis . . . . Where then can the child show and mature his governing power , his resistance , his generosity , his gentleness , in short every root and blossom of society , except in freedom among his equals ? Teach children by children ! The entrance into their playroom is for them an entrance into the great world , and their mental school of industry is in the child 's playroom and nursery . " . // 647 . The Playground a Social Institution " In the large social problem of providing for play , the playground becomes the primary and essential factor in making play reasonably possible . The gymnasium , schoolroom , nursery , or other inclosed space should be considered an adjunct to the playground . As the little child gets older the play impulse expresses itself more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more highly organized . From the almost unlimited range of game material at present available , certain lists are here suggested as adaptable to the different grades in school , and to boys and girls when games and exercises should be adapted to their separate needs . " 648 . Play Necessary for Mental and Physical Development " For years play was looked upon merely as a sort of inevitable waste of time among children , but scientific study of the cultivation of these organisms has shown that play is in most respects the best , the ideal form of the exercise of the powers . Particularly is this true for the younger children .... Play is the activity which their own natures suggest and guide ; it is varied as their diverse budding capabilities require ; and when free it is not carried beyond the point where one activity interferes with the development of others . The young child perhaps learns more and develops better through its play than through any other form of activity . Opportunity for varied play under healthful outward conditions is beyond doubt the chief need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of children to whom full opportunity for such play is given shows striking superiority , as compared with children to whom such opportunities are denied . " 649 . Play Is to the Boy What Work Is to the Man " The boy without a playground is the man without a job . He is suffering identically the same loss ; the absence from his life of // the chief means of living , the cutting of the main strand of his existence . Play is to the boy what work is to the man ? the fullest attainable expression of what he is and the effective means of becoming more . And in the case of the best work the expression is of the same instincts ; the two are identical ? the voice of the same river though at different points on its course . There is , it is true , if our biological theories are correct , the difference that while the man 's work only sustains life , the child 's play creates it ; but that is not a difference which justifies our regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Play , Sports , and Games The view of Groos that play is practice for future adult activities is very partial , superficial , and perverse . It ignores the past where lie the keys to all play activities . Not only play , which is the purest expression of motor heredity , but work and all exercise owe most of whatever pleasure they bring , to the past . The best exercise for the young should thus be more directed to develop the basal powers old to the race than those peculiar to the individual , and it should enforce those psycho-neural and muscular forms which race habit has handed down rather than insist upon those arbitrarily designed to develop our ideas of symmetry regardless of heredity. 651 . Values of Play " Wisely directed play has a powerful influence on the physical , mental and moral health of the school child . Furthermore , the character of the instruction and direction of our children in their // play to-day will have much to do with their physical , mental , moral standards as citizens in the community to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Play that is wisely organized and effectively supervised will : 1 . Produce and conserve health . 2 . Counteract fatigue . 3 . Make children ( and adults ) happy . 4 . Arouse interest . 5 . Sharpen wits . 6 . Overcome awkwardness. 7 . Develop strength , endurance and bodily control . 8 . Secure obedience , ready response , respect for rules and regulations , orderly conduct , courtesy , self-restraint , self-control , love and habit of fair play , loyalty , honesty , sense of justice and a sociable spirit . 9 . Health habits ? physical , mental and moral ? are formed through play . " Physical Training Syllabus , The University of the State of New York . 652 . The Place of Play in the Program " Educators are coming to see that a very important aim of all training should be to make children more successful and happy as children rather than to attempt to make men and women of boys and girls of six or ten . The vigor and robustness which enable one to live a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom , if ever , found except in people who have spent much of their childhood in enjoyable activities outdoors . " Report , National Child Health Council , Health for School Children , p. 38. 653 . Instruction in How to Play " Our youth need instruction in how to play as much as they do in how to work , ' he continued . Those who are engaged in our industries need an opportunity for outdoor life and recreation no // less than they need opportunity of employment . Side by side with the industrial plant should be the gymnasium and the athletic field . " Along with the learning of a trade by which a livelihood is to be earned should go the learning of how to participate in the activities of recreation , by which life may not only be more enjoyable but more rounded out and complete . ' " 654 . Teaching , a Necessary Part of Play " Teaching is thus a necessary part of play because the play instincts themselves call for it . But teaching enhances play for another reason also ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is itself a social as well as a physical inheritance , handed down partly by tradition , not wholly evolved by each generation for itself . Children do not inherit baseball any more than they inherit the Lord 's Prayer , as George E. Johnson truly says . They inherit tag in rudimentary form , just as puppies do , but they do not inherit cross tag , hill dill , or prisoner 's base . The play instincts are a constant factor in every generation , but their satisfaction is partly a matter of discovery . The best games are gradually evolved , and handed on from one generation to another . A good game is a work of genius , a happy interpretation of the inherited spiritual nature of mankind . Of our whole social inheritance , games and other socially developed satisfactions of the play instincts , including the fine arts and the conventions on which they rest , are our most emancipating legacy . Men have developed expressions of their spiritual nature deeper and more satisfying than those that unassisted nature ever taught , the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Play Should Be Directed " There is little difference in the health value of directed and undirected play as long as the same activities are carried on with // equal vigor and with equal pleasure to the children , but two practical difficulties are connected with undirected play as it is ordinarily found in our cities . The first is that for the majority of children it is not play at all , but loafing , and the second is that , when it is play , it is quite as apt to be craps , jacks or marbles , as baseball ; and craps , jacks and marbles have comparatively little moral , social , physical health or happiness value . " 656 . Choice of Playthings " Give no plaything whose end is only to be looked at ; but let every one be such as to lead to work . " RICHTER , Levana , p. 156. 657 . The Play Way " We are also coming to recognize the value of harnessing up the play-motive when we wish strenuous exertion . It does not mean lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will play till he drops from fatigue , and do it all voluntarily for the love of the cause . He will not voluntarily do that in his work , where the play-spirit is omitted . It is the boys or girls who enter with the greatest zest into the actions of men as reconstructed in their histories , who take sides in the struggles , and who are warmed by their sympathetic and vicarious participation in the historical actions , who have most historical experience and get the greatest good from their history . It is the boy who wants to win in the spelling match who will manfully master the entire spelling book as a part of the game . The pupil who sees his mathematics as a series of interesting puzzles and games , is the one who will come nearest to conquering every difficulty that shows its head . The thing that one enjoys is the thing at which one will strain every nerve . Given a healthy play-motive and the right opportunity , it is like a high power engine and a straight track ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction between play and work for the child is not very definite , for some wise people believe that the more like play the child makes his serious tasks , the more benefit he will derive from them . So in physical education it is more desirable that the child should have opportunity and guidance for the doing of those large activities which will keep him vigorous and robust , which will develop alertness , self-control , with the other desirable qualities and all in the spirit of joyous , free , exultant movement . " 659 . A Consideration of Play and Work " A like balance in mental life characterizes process and product . We met one important phase of this adjustment in considering play and work . In play , interest centers in activity , without much reference to its outcome . The sequence of deeds , images , emotions , suffices on its own account . In work , the end holds attention and controls the notice given to means . Since the difference is one of direction of interest , the contrast is one of emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of activity or outcome is transformed into isolation of one from the other , play degenerates into fooling , and work into drudgery. " 660 . Drudgery Concerned Only with Ends " Exclusive interest in the result alters work to drudgery . For by drudgery is meant those activities in which the interest in the outcome does not suffuse the means of getting the result . Whenever a piece of work becomes drudgery , the process of doing loses all value for the doer ; he cares solely for what is to be had at the end of it . The work itself , the putting forth of energy , is hateful ; it is just a necessary evil , since without it some important end would be missed . Now it is a commonplace that in the work of the world many things have to be done the doing of which is not , intrinsically very interesting . However , the argument that // children should be kept doing drudgery-tasks because thereby they acquire power to be faithful to distasteful duties , is wholly fallacious . Repulsion , shirking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? not loyal love of duty . Willingness to work for ends by means of acts not naturally attractive is best attained by securing such an appreciation of the value of the end that a sense of its value is transferred to its means of accomplishment . Not interesting in themselves , they borrow interest from the result with which they are associated . " 661 . Play , Work , and Drudgery " Of more significance is our thought of all forms of play as distinct from work or drudgery . The difference here is not primarily one of the kind of activity , but one of attitude . No given activity can arbitrarily be placed in either class . Listening to a concert , working problems in mathematics , sewing or painting , attending a reception , playing a game of whist , taking a walk , working in the garden , ? any of these may be work of the hardest kind to one person and the most delightful play to another . This difference in attitude is caused by the difference in certain characteristics of the activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being engaged in , not for its own sake , but because of some result worth while , only to be reached by means of the given activity . The eye of the worker is fixed outside of the activity on the result beyond . When the activity seems play to the individual , the process itself seems worth while ; he is concerned only with the activity , that in itself satisfies him . The same result may be obtained as in the former case , but it is not the most important thing to the one engaged in the activity . When it is work , the process is merely a means to a desirable end , but when it is play the two are fused and the process with its result seem desirable . For example , the boys who were paid to clear the potato patch of potato bugs found it most disagreeable work at first , and did it only to secure the money or escape the punishment for disobedience , or both . But // when the competition and make-believe elements were introduced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy tried to get the largest collection , ? then the money received was no longer the largest factor , but the process itself became of absorbing interest . " 662 . Significance of the Play Spirit " It is because of this vital relationship between work and play that play has been called one of the greatest factors in education . I t is the aim of educators to-day to take more of this same play spirit into the schoolroom . So to arrange the school work that touch of it could be done in the play spirit would be a tremendous gain . So long as the school organization is as it is , and so long as civilized ideals hold sway , work and even drudgery must have a place in the education of every child , but when possible the play spirit must be encouraged , be planned for if results worth while educationally are to be obtained . For it must be remembered that the play spirit appears whenever activities are suited to the individual 's capacity and stage of development , and in themselves satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Play " Playfulness is a more important consideration than play . he former is an attitude of mind ; the latter is a passing outward manifestation of this attitude . When things are treated simply vehicles of suggestion , what is suggested overrides the thing . Hence the playful attitude is one of freedom . The person is not bound to the physical traits of things , nor does he care whether a thing really means ( as we say ) what he takes it to represent . ' en the child plays horse with a broom , and cars with chairs , the , t t hat the broom does not really represent a horse , or a chair a locomotive , is of no account . In order , then , that playfulness
