The Zionist Organization of America closed another of its annual bickerings at Atlantic City last week . It was the 30th anniversary of this group which has sought to organize Palestine as a national homeland for Jews . In that purpose they have practically succeeded . Palestine has been set up as a League of Nations mandate entrusted to England 's overseeing . It is governed by a High Commissioner who deals with regional problems as they affect Jewish settlers through what is known as the Zionist Executive . The High Commissioner also guards the interests of Arabs and other indigents of the region . <P> Millions of dollars have been dumped into Palestine , chiefly from U. S. purses ; 150,000 Jewish immigrants have been carried there chiefly from countries of eastern <P> Europe . Many more have gone from the U. S. , driven by a traditional idealism . Colonies have been established ; trading cities created ; harbors , roads and railroads constructed ; industries set going . Most of this has been accomplished since 1921 . <P> But all has not been economically well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present 8,000 men and women are out of work . They are traders , too many of whom had been permitted to migrate into the country . There have been insufficient goods manufactured or grown locally to supply them with trade ; there have not been enough customers to take the goods they handled . To furnish work for these 8,000 , Great Britain has authorized a loan of $25,000,000 to build harbors and railroads , a concession has been granted to develop the hydro-electric power of the Jordan River , and the potash deposits of the Dead Sea will be worked . <P> At the Atlantic City convention of the Zionist Organization of America last week , Louis Lipsky , chairman since 1922 , was charged with all the woes of Palestine . His ideal has been paternal . He would have Jewish immigrants to Palestine fit into a social , cultural and economic frame which the World Zionist Organization would build for them . ( Chaim Weizmann , British explosive inventor , is head of the World Zionist Organization . ) Other Jews , non-Zionists , like Louis Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their own enterprises and order by private initiative . Other Jews , Zionists and non-Zionists , have still further schemes for making Palestine a selfsupporting , spiritual Utopia . At last week 's convention Zionists argued at one another . <P> Israel Goldberg , publicity director of the United Palestine Appeal , the organization charged with collecting U. S. funds for disbursement in Palestine , cried all faults at Chairman Louis Lipsky : " Shall we or shall we not hold Lipsky responsible ? " The convention yelled , " No ! " He yelled : " If I had been in the administration things would have been different ! " The convention laughed loudly . Nathan Straus , philanthropist , ill , sent a telegram : " For God 's sake , do n't waste time in fault finding and squabbling . " <P> Chairman Louis Lipsky , who had scarcely slept for days in efforts to mollify blatant programists , finally found himself re-elected chairman of the Zionist Organization of America . His own program was thereby approved .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
