The landlord who let his tenant select her own wallpaper , the homeowner who fidgeted while his white-overalled paperhanger butted the paper like a crazy-quilt , the rural housewife who hung her own-they spent $40,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 U. S. wallpaper manufactories busy . The Wallpaper Manufacturers of America last week noted that this was more than the 323,000,000 rolls of $34,755,000 value of 1924 . <P> Temptation .
