SCENE : Deck of PETER CHADWICK 'S house boat , " Journey 's End . " The " Journey 's End " is a luxurious house boat , now tied up to the bank of a river in Maine . The author has assumed this river to be the Penobscot , near the mouth of Frenchman 's Bay , but it is not necessary to mention the exact locality . The cabin is at L. of stage in the bow of the boat . At stage R. are deck chairs , a table L. C. , etc. , covered by a gay deck awning . Over the deck rail at back one catches a view of a wooded shore . At back C. two steps lead up to a gangplank connecting with a rough dock . The cabins and deck rail are so arranged that very little of the detail of the shore is seen . BILL BRADFORD , a young fellow of about twenty-five sits sadly and moodily in deck chair at R. ; he has a cigarette in his mouth and smokes sulkily . CAPTAIN JONES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's uniform stands on the small upper deck on top of the cabin . CAPTAIN JONES is not much of a seaman , hence his position as captain of a house boat . He is a very fussy , nervous little man who is now looking out in the direction of the audience through a pair of marine glasses . CAPTAIN The river is very high , sir , very ! ( BILL does not answer and CAPTAIN JONES crosses down the ladder to the deck and crosses to him . ) Remarkable high water , sir . p. 3 BILL What of it ? CAPTAIN ( Who is very nervous ) It 's been getting worse all day , sir , they must have opened the gates up above to let the logs down . If this boat was mine I 'd put an auxiliary engine in her . It 's the first time I ever had command of a ship that was as helpless as a baby , sir . I 'd better get another bow line out . ( Exit to upper cabin . ) ( RUTH CHADWICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enters from cabin as CAPTAIN JONES exits to bow at L. ) RUTH What 's he fussing about now ? BILL Water 's high he says , although I do n't see what difference that makes so long as we 're on top of it . RUTH The funny old thing ! He will insist on making a noise like a sea captain ! I suppose he 'd be very much offended if one was to call him the janitor of the good ship Journey 's end ! BILL Awful bore , a house boat . RUTH ( Crosses C. ) Well ! I must say you 're not very polite . ( She sits in deck chair beside him . ) BILL ( Bitterly ) Polite ! What a fool I was to come down here ! p. 4 RUTH ( Gently ) Please do n't , Bill ! BILL Like a damned silly moth that ca n't keep away from the candle ! RUTH ( Severely ) I told you you must n't come here if you were going to act like this ! BILL Do you love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's my ideal ! BILL I suppose he must be , only I ca n't see it ! RUTH Are you going to break your promise ? BILL It 's tough ! Going away for a month and coming back and finding you engaged to a doctor ! RUTH I do n't see what his profession matters , and you know my heart never has been very strong ! BILL You ! With a golf handicap of fifteen , and the best canoeist on the river ! You ought to know that exercise is better for any woman than a doctor ! It 's awful , Ruth , I always thought of course it was going to be you and me some day ! RUTH I like you , Bill , but I would n't want to marry you . BILL ( Rises , crosses back to chair R. and sits ) It just knocks all the wind out of me ! p. 5 RUTH I told you all about it in New York , after you got home ! That ought to be enough ! You should n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four o'clock train and he wo n't like you being around . BILL If I were a girl I 'd never marry a jealous man ! RUTH You 're acting like a spoiled baby ! He 's a brilliant man ! I was never so flattered in my life as I was when he asked me to marry him ! BILL ( Sadly ) I do n't see why your father did n't put a stop to it ! RUTH Father thoroughly approved ! BILL That 's funny ! He never approved of me ! RUTH He seems quite happy about it . BILL If I had n't gone to Florida to play in that golf tournament it would n't have happened ! ( RUTH rises and crosses to BILL . ) He 's not your sort at all , but he 's turned your silly little head ! You 'll make a rotten wife for a doctor , ( RUTH crosses to cabin )  --  and you 'll be miserable , thank God ! Doctors are never at home . RUTH ( Near door ) Well , I guess they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a well preserved man of fifty enters from the cabin ; he is dressed in neat sports clothes and is fastening a flower in his buttonhole . ) Why , Father ! How sweet of you to dress up so gorgeously to welcome Jack ! p. 6 PETER ( A little confused ) Yes , very glad to have him ( crosses C. ) for your sake , my dear , only doctors make me nervous , all of ' em . Never met one yet who did n't spend his time telling me what I must n't eat . They always give me indigestion ! BILL ( Rises ) If I was in your place I would n't have one of them in my family ! PETER Oh , I am not worried about that . RUTH Well , you 'd better be ! ( Crosses L. C. ) Jack told me the day I left New York that once we were married he was going to keep his eye on you ! Father is going to live with us you know , Bill . PETER Well  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , of course circumstances might arise  --  to  --  to  --  ( He stops nervously and looks at his watch . ) I 'm late ! ( Crosses to gangplank . ) ( BILL goes R. ) RUTH For what ? He 's going to taxi out from the station . PETER I know , but I promised to be at the hotel at four , the car is waiting for me ! RUTH ( Up to him ) You wo n't be late to dinner ? p. 7 PETER ( Nervously ) Why , no  --  no  --  as a matter of fact I am bringing a guest back with me for the week-end . RUTH A guest ! Oh , well , I think we 've room enough . ( Crosses down L. ) I 'll try to make him comfortable . PETER To be perfectly frank with you it  --  it  --  it is n't him  --  it 's a  --  a lady ! ( Crosses down C. ) RUTH ( Shocked  --  stops and turns to PETER ) Lady ! ( BILL crosses R. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you before , but it  --  it slipped my mind ! RUTH ( Coldly ) A lady ! ? PETER Yes , she is very anxious to meet you and  --  and  --  ( He looks at his watch . ) We 'll be back in just a few moments , my dear . I 'll tell her how sweet you were about making room for her . ( He crosses hastily to gangplank . ) RUTH ( Alarmed , crosses up ) But Father ! I do n't understand ! PETER ( Looks at watch ) Just time to make it ! See you when we get back ! ( He exits over the gangplank to shore. ) p. 8 RUTH Bill ! I 'm worried about him ! ( At gangplank . ) BILL ( Sadly  --  sits chair R. ) If you ask me your whole family is in a bad way ! RUTH ( Thoughtfully  --  coming down C. ) A woman ! BILL He just took one good look at that doctor of yours and got desperate ! RUTH But Father would n't ! No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice that flower he was sticking in his buttonhole ? RUTH I 'm afraid , Bill ! BILL It 's a judgment on you ! ( CAPTAIN JONES enters from L. ) CAPTAIN There 's a taxi coming down the station road . I guess it must be Doctor Waller ! ( He goes to gangplank at back and looks off . ) I 'll help with his things . ( He exits over gangplank . ) ( BILL rises and crosses to L. ) RUTH If it is Jack and of course it is , you be careful ! It is n't my fault that you come mooning around me when I do n't want you , and I do n't want him to blame me for it ! p. 9 BILL ( Sulkily ) Oh , I guess I know when I 'm not wanted . ( DOCTOR JACK WALLER enters over the gangplank at back , carrying a doctor 's hand-bag . He is a good looking man of thirty or thirty-five , dressed for traveling . He is followed by SAM , a quiet , well-mannered servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAPTAIN JONES bring on several suitcases , golf bag , etc. , one of the articles being a doctor 's hand-bag . ) DOCTOR ( As he sees RUTH ) My dear girl ! RUTH Jack ! It is so nice to see you ! ( They meet at C. and JACK is about to kiss her when he sees BILL . SAM and CAPTAIN JONES exit to cabin . ) DOCTOR Why , it 's Bill ! BILL Oh , I know you do n't want me here . DOCTOR ( Crosses L. to BILL ) My dear boy , of course I want you here . ( Offers hand . ) I 'm delighted to see you . BILL ( Crosses up L. ) I am sorry , but I ca n't shake hands with you . DOCTOR Why on earth not ? ( Puts doctor 's bag and hat on chair by cabin door. ) p. 10 RUTH Bill means that he knows that you must be angry with him , because he is with me so much . DOCTOR ( Crosses C. ) What ? Good old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , my boy , that after Ruth and I are married , I think that we 'll adopt you . BILL ( Coming down L. ) If you had any sense of decency at all you 'd be jealous of me . DOCTOR No , sir , I 'm rather old-fashioned about some things , and that is one of them . Jealousy is silly . RUTH Oh , is it ? DOCTOR Too silly for words . BILL Jealousy is n't the only silly thing around this place . ( Glares at DOCTOR , crosses L. a step . ) I do n't mind telling you that I 'd take her away from you if I could . DOCTOR ( C. Pleasantly ) Oh , Bill , you do n't mean that ? BILL ( L. ) You call yourself a doctor , let me tell you something . You make me actually ill . RUTH ( R. ) Bill Bradford ! BILL I beg your pardon . ( Crosses L. ) Of course I should n't have come here , I know that , do n't blame her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't wanted . Sun is going down ; lovely afternoon , is n't it ? If you do n't mind I think I 'll go and dress . ( He exits to cabin. ) p. 11 RUTH ( Crosses R. a step ) Poor Bill ! DOCTOR Oh , Bill 's all right . Nice boy . ( CAPTAIN JONES and SAM enter from cabin . He turns to SAM . ) Sam ! SAM Yes sir ? DOCTOR This is the future Mrs. Waller . SAM Yes , sir . I 'm sure I hope you 'll be very happy . ( SAM and CAPTAIN JONES exit to upper cabin . ) RUTH I like that man of yours . It was nice of him to say he hoped we would be very happy . DOCTOR Yes . RUTH I think so , do n't you ? I mean , I think we 'll be happy ? DOCTOR ( Cheerfully ) Not a doubt ! ( Sits chair R. C. ) RUTH You 're fond of me ? ( Sits on small table by chair R. C. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afraid ? DOCTOR Of what ? RUTH Oh , of all it means , marrying someone , and getting to really love someone very much . p. 12 DOCTOR Not a bit afraid ! RUTH In spite of her ? DOCTOR Who ? RUTH The other one ! The woman you 've never mentioned to me . DOCTOR What woman ? RUTH It 's silly to pretend . ( Rises  --  crosses L. C. ) I know there was another woman . DOCTOR How do you ? RUTH You 're too well trained for an amateur . Some woman took a lot of pains with you . DOCTOR Nonsense ! RUTH I 'm not a baby , you know , and there is some hungry worm just gnawing at your conscience . DOCTOR Absolutely not ! My past is an open book . RUTH But books nowadays are getting to be  --  you know what I mean ! Come on ! ( She sits on deck chair and looks up at him eagerly . ) You know about poor old Bill  --  fifty-fifty  --  ! Tell me about your shameful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , if you must know . I 've been through hades and out the other side ! I 've been tortured and humiliated and made a fool of , and whipped , and spurred , and ridden till I 'm saddle-sore , and all for nothing  --  p. 13 RUTH What 's her name ? DOCTOR Who said anything about a woman ? RUTH I recognized the description . Who is she ? DOCTOR She 's a widow now , worse luck ! RUTH What was she to you ? DOCTOR I was engaged to be married to her once . RUTH For how long ? DOCTOR Oh  --  for years , off and on . RUTH How you must have loved her ! DOCTOR I do n't know . RUTH Of course you did . DOCTOR ( Bitterly ) Do you think it 's love when two people are drawn together by some intangible emotion that crucifies them both ! When neither one of them is ever at peace , ever really happy for one moment . Do you call that love ? RUTH I should think that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I was sick of it long before it ended , and when it did end I was mighty glad of it ! ( Rises  --  crosses R. ) RUTH Really glad ? p. 14 DOCTOR I never knew what peace was until she ran away and married Jim Bragdon ! RUTH While she was still engaged to you ? DOCTOR Yes . RUTH ( Rises ) The beast ! DOCTOR I suppose so . I do n't know . RUTH But some of it must have been your fault , if she lived happily with this Jim Bragdon . DOCTOR She left him inside of three months . I never knew why . I never wanted to . He was killed in an accident soon after that , poor devil . ( Sits chair R. C. again . ) RUTH And she 's been a widow for over three years ? DOCTOR Yes . RUTH And you 've never seen her again ? DOCTOR ( Confused ) Why  --  RUTH ( Sternly ) You have ! DOCTOR Twice . RUTH ( Crosses to table and sits ) Tell me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , summer before last . I was at the hotel with  --  er  --  with a party of friends . p. 15 RUTH Men ? DOCTOR Oh , yes , naturally , men , and  --  er  --  women . RUTH ( Coldly ) Oh ! DOCTOR There was a girl in the party that I  --  liked  --  nothing sentimental  --  just  --  you know . RUTH ( Coldly ) Yes , I know . DOCTOR We were in the dining-room one day and I had a queer sort of feeling as though someone were behind me , and I looked around ; she was at the next table , and she smiled at me ! RUTH What did you do ? DOCTOR Caught the next train to New York ! RUTH How long before you saw her again ? DOCTOR About a year , at Placid . I was at the club . RUTH Alone ? DOCTOR Well  --  yes  --  and no . RUTH ( Rises  --  crosses C. ) Oh ! DOCTOR There was a girl there , a nice girl . I rather liked her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 16 DOCTOR Yes  --  she came  --  I do n't like to think about it . I do n't like to talk about it ! ( Rises  --  crosses to RUTH C. ) RUTH You must talk about it ! DOCTOR ( Crosses to L. ) She came and , well , trouble came with her , it always does . She got friendly with my friends , and  --  er  --  then my friends were n't friendly with me . RUTH You mean that twice you 've gotten silly about some pretty girl , and each time she has shown up and put a stop to it ! DOCTOR Well  --  I do n't know that I was exactly what you 'd call silly , but that 's what happened ! RUTH ( Firmly ) She loves you ! DOCTOR Loves me ! Ha ! Ha ! RUTH She does ! DOCTOR Listen ! She hates me so much that she 's devoting her whole life to keeping any of her sex from marrying me ! RUTH She must be attractive ? DOCTOR Being attractive is n't everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being contented . Sometimes in the night , even now , I wake up in a cold perspiration , dreaming that she and I are back together again . I tell you , life is too short . I 've had my lesson , fireworks are all right for the Fourth of July but I used to have them every night . p. 17 RUTH But after such a romantic thing as you 've lived through , would you be satisfied with just me ? ( Crosses to him . ) DOCTOR ( Earnestly ) It 's what I want ! Just you ! We 'll be happy , Ruth , and contented , and I can attend to my business and get to be somebody in my profession ! That 's what I want , that 's what love means , or ought to mean . RUTH I suppose so  --  only  --  only I wonder if she knows about me ? DOCTOR ( Smiles ) How could she ? I guess this is one time I put something over on her ! A house boat is pretty safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another summer hotel ! RUTH I want you to answer me one question ! DOCTOR Yes , dear ? RUTH ( Severely ) I want you to tell me what you did to her , to make her run away and marry that other man ! DOCTOR Absolutely nothing ! RUTH You 'd quarreled ? DOCTOR ( Pleasantly ) Every day . RUTH Terribly , I mean ? DOCTOR ( Calmly ) We always quarreled terribly . p. 18 RUTH Well  --  I do n't like it ! She could n't have been the only one to blame ! I 'd like to meet her . ( Crosses C. ) DOCTOR ( Nervously ) Do n't say it ! ( Crosses to her . ) I 'm going to make you marry me before I go back to New York . I 'll lay that ghost forever ! RUTH But I 'd like to know what it was you did to her ! DOCTOR Why , you never talked to me like that before . You do n't mean to say she 's going to queer my by absent treatment ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I 'm not ! I think I love you all the better since I know that you did such a terrible thing ! DOCTOR What terrible thing ? RUTH I do n't know , but it must have been awful to make her act like that . Of course you 'll have to tell me sometime , but not to-day . DOCTOR ( Worried ) Do you know that 's just about the way she used to talk . RUTH You 're not to worry any more about her . If she tries to make any trouble between us just you leave her to me . I 'm not at all sure she did n't treat you about the way you deserved . ( CAPTAIN JONES enters ) p. 19 CAPTAIN Very high water ! Current 's getting stronger every minute ! I got another bow line out , but she 's straining at it terrible ! RUTH Well , what of it ? ( Crosses L. C. ) CAPTAIN She ai n't seaworthy , you know , nice house boat , but a little mite more of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask me ! RUTH Well , the journey 's End may not be very fast , but she 's safe ! Come , jack , I 'll show you your cabin , dinner will be ready before long . DOCTOR Nice secluded private sort of thing , a house boat ! I think I 'll buy one ! ( He exits to cabin with RUTH . ) ( PETER CHADWICK enters over the gangplank with PAULA LEA , a good looking and extremely well dressed woman of about thirty . CAPTAIN starts up L. ) PETER ( Proudly ) There , my dear ! This is the Journey 's End ! PAULA Charming ! Perfect ! You really did n't do it justice ! PETER Captain Jones ! Miss Lea ! PAULA How do you do , Captain ? CAPTAIN ( Coming down ) How are you , Miss ? Excuse me , Mr. Chadwick , but I never did see so much water ! p. 20 PETER Where ? ( Crosses C. ) CAPTAIN In the river , sir . PETER Good place for it ! ( RUTH enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah ! There you are , my dear . This is Ruth , Paula . ( C. ) RUTH ( Startled ) Paula ! ( L. ) PAULA ( Sternly ) You have n't told her ! ( R. ) RUTH Told me ! ( She looks from one to the other amazed . ) PAULA ( Severely ) Peter ! RUTH ( In horror ) Peter ! PETER Why , the fact is , my dear , I am , that is  --  ( RUTH looks from one to the other . ) RUTH ( Sternly ) Are you going to be married , Father ? PETER Why  --  er  --  yes , my dear , since you mention it ! I meant to have told you yesterday but I  --  I think I went fishing or something . p. 21 RUTH ( Crosses to PAULA ) Is n't he silly ! Of course it 's rather a shock , hearing about it like this . PAULA ( Kisses her ) You 're a dear ! PETER Nice girl ! Both of you ! Two nice girls ! Thank goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that he never told you that we 've planned for weeks that I was to come to the hotel here and join your party ! RUTH He never told me anything at all , and I do n't like it ! PAULA ( Severely ) Neither do I ! ( They turn sternly on PETER . ) PETER As long as you two agree I do n't care a hang what it 's about ! RUTH ( Starting L. ) He 's hopeless ! Do let me show you to your room . PAULA You 'll see to my things , Peter . PETER As soon as they get here . ( Crosses down R. C. ) PAULA ( At door of cabin ) Charming ! RUTH It is nice , is n't it ? ( PAULA and RUTH exit to cabin . SAM enters from upper cabin. ) p. 22 SAM Good-evening , sir . ( PETER looks at him inquiringly . ) I 'm Doctor Waller 's man , sir . PETER Oh , then Dr. Waller has arrived ? SAM Yes , sir . He 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're Sam ! SAM Yes , sir . PETER He 's told me about you , with him in France ! SAM I was Major Waller 's chauffeur , sir . I 've been with him ever since . CAPTAIN ( Offstage ) Look out ! SAM What 's up ? ( He turns and jumps up on gangplank . ) Hey ! Look out there ! PETER ( Crosses up ) What is it ? ( From out back , on the land comes a loud scream in MOLLY 'S voice and a crash , then a tinkle of breaking glass and a second scream . ) SAM Good Lord ! ( He runs out over the gangplank and exists . ) ( PETER goes up on gangplank . RUTH runs out of cabin followed by BILL who has changed to dinner clothes. ) p. 23 RUTH What is it ? PETER ( At foot of gangplank ) Car out of control ! Two women ! Run right down the hill into a rail fence ! RUTH How awful ! ( SAM 's voice heard outside . ) SAM ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MOLLY ( Outside ) But she may be terribly , hurt how do I know she is n't ? SAM I do n't think she 's stunned . I guess she 's only fainted or something . ( SAM enters on gangplank with JOYCE BRAGDON in his arms . JOYCE has fainted , or at least pretends she has fainted , and her very smart sports suit is rather in disorder . As SAM carries her over the gangplank they are followed by MOLLY , a young maid servant , who carefully brings with her a suitcase and several parcels . ) RUTH ( Moves chair L. C. to C. ) Here , Sam ! Put her here ! SAM Yes , Miss . ( He places JOYCE in steamer chair at C. ) PETER ( As all gather around ) Poor girl ! I hope she is n't badly hurt . She 's pretty , too . p. 24 RUTH I think her eyes are beginning to open ! ( L. of JOYCE . ) BILL Yes , she  --  RUTH Hush ! ( She bends over JOYCE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all right ! JOYCE ( Faintly ) Is  --  is  --  ( C. ) RUTH Yes . What is it ? JOYCE Is  --  is there a doctor here ? BILL She wants a doctor ! ( R. of JOYCE . ) SAM Doctor Waller is here ! ( Behind JOYCE . ) JOYCE Thanks , he 'll do ! ( She closes her eyes and falls back . ) RUTH Get him ! SAM Yes , Miss . ( He runs into cabin . ) MOLLY Oh , it was a terrible thing ! An awful thing ! ( Up L. ) RUTH You must try to control yourself ! PETER Good thing the doctor happened to be here ! ( Above chair R. of JOYCE . ) ( MOLLY crosses up L. near stage. ) p. 25 RUTH ( To JOYCE ) Just a moment ! He will be with you in just a moment ! ( SAM enters . ) SAM He 's coming ! PETER Good ! ( DOCTOR enters . ) DOCTOR ( At cabin door ) Somebody hurt , Sam says ! RUTH Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep cool now ! ( He steps over and sees JOYCE and stops in horror . ) Good Heavens ! RUTH You know her ! DOCTOR Why  --  er  --  I 've seen her before . BILL Well , you 're not going to let her die , are you ? PETER Do what you can for her , my boy ! DOCTOR Yes , of course ! ( He stoops over reluctantly and takes her hand . She opens her eyes calmly and looks at DOCTOR ) JOYCE Oh , Jack , you said you 'd never hold my hand again ! DOCTOR Oh , hang ! ( He drops her hand and steps back . ) RUTH Oh ! ( She glares at JOYCE  --  crosses up C. ) p. 26 BILL ( To DOCTOR ) I thought you told me you were old-fashioned about some things ! ( He looks at him suspiciously . ) DOCTOR ( Coldly  --  crosses L. C. ) If you will excuse me I 'll go back to my cabin . PETER ( Crosses to DOCTOR ) Go ! I do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this ! DOCTOR Like what ? She is n't hurt at all ! JOYCE ( As if in pain ) Oh ! SAM It 's her leg , sir  --  I think  --  it was all sort of doubled up under her like . PETER ( RUTH comes down to R. of PETER ) That 's bad ! You 'd better take a look at it ! JOYCE ( Sits up suddenly ) He sha n't do anything of the kind ! ( She pulls her skirt down hastily . ) DOCTOR ( Coldly  --  crosses C. ) You forget that I am a physician ! JOYCE You can study anatomy on some other subject ; as a matter of fact it 's the one department of medicine you know too much about . p. 27 BILL I guess she knows him all right . DOCTOR I do , this is Mrs. Bragdon , Mr. Chadwick , Miss Chadwick , Mr. Bradford . JOYCE ( Pleasantly ) I am so glad to meet you ! RUTH ( To DOCTOR ) I knew it the very minute she looked at you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like this  --  dropping down is rather good , do n't you think ! Ha , ha ! Oh , dear ! Now I 'm going to be hysterical ! I do have the queerest feeling , it seems to be my heart , but do n't let the doctor look at that , please . I really do n't think he could tell what was wrong with it ! RUTH ( Coldly ) He is a heart specialist ! JOYCE No ? Oh , dear ! Not a specialist ! Ha ! Please excuse me ! Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! It 's the shock ! Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! PETER ( To DOCTOR ) What are you going to do with her ? DOCTOR ( Firmly ) Absolutely nothing ! ( RUTH crosses to DOCTOR . ) PETER ( Around back of chair ) Well , I am ! ( Crosses to JOYCE. ) p. 28 JOYCE I 'll be all right ! I know my leg is n't broken , and of course my heart could n't be , or the specialist would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it 's funny you did n't correct such a silly mistake , Doctor ? DOCTOR ( Firmly ) Hearts do break , Mrs. Bragdon , and mend again , and get stronger than before , not all hearts , I have known hearts , in my professional capacity of course , that nothing ever seemed to affect ! JOYCE Then that 's another thing that I need n't worry about , so perhaps I 'd better go . ( She starts to rise . ) BILL Let me help you . ( She gets up with BILL 's help . ) JOYCE Oh , it does n't matter , the only important thing is that I should go at once ! BILL Do you think you 're able ? JOYCE Yes , I 'm quite all right . ( As she sees the DOCTOR with his arm around RUTH . ) Oh ! BILL Look out ! ( JOYCE faints again and BILL catches her . ) PETER ( Angrily , to DOCTOR ) You might have known something would happen ! p. 29 DOCTOR ( Sadly ) I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch in the cabin ! SAM Yes , sir ! ( Crosses C. ) PETER It is absolutely out of the question that she should even think of leaving here to-night ! ( SAM picks JOYCE up and exits with her to cabin , followed by all but RUTH and DOCTOR . RUTH puts chair back L. ) DOCTOR ( Looking at watch  --  crosses L. ) Do you happen to know what time the trains leave for New York ? ( Gets bag and hat and starts for gangplank . ) RUTH You 're not going to run away again ! DOCTOR I think I 'd better ! RUTH ( Stops him ) But you ca n't keep on running away all the rest of your life . DOCTOR ( Sadly ) Oh , I suppose I 'll get used to it in time ! RUTH But after all what can she do ? DOCTOR I do n't know . I know what she has done , but she never repeats . p. 30 RUTH You have to fight a woman like that , and I 'm going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daring to make another row after what she 's already done to me ! RUTH Neither can I , unless  --  DOCTOR Unless what ? RUTH ( Coldly ) Unless you gave her some very good reason for it ! DOCTOR You see ! You have n't even talked to her yet , and already she 's making trouble between us ! RUTH And that 's just what she wants to do , but she ca n't ! That 's the way to beat her ! Just laugh at her ! No matter what she does , we 'll stick together ! DOCTOR ( Sadly ) We 'll try . RUTH Try ? Why , it 's silly ! Too obvious for words ! I am not going to worry at all , as a matter of fact I think it will be fun ! DOCTOR Fun ? RUTH ( Crosses L. ) Yes  --  now I 'll run and dress , and at dinner , if she has the nerve to come to it , we 'll both of us be perfectly sweet to her but we 'll be careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to start anything we 'll just laugh at her , out loud , both of us ! p. 31 DOCTOR Laugh at her ! That 's a great idea ! You 're a wonder ! RUTH Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! ( Crosses L. ) Oh , dear ! Do n't be so silly ! This is going to be the most fun I 've ever had in all my life ! ( She runs toward cabin and meets SAM  --  who enters  --  almost bumps into him . ) SAM Excuse me ! RUTH All right ! Hurry and dress , Jack ! ( She exits to cabin . SAM to DOCTOR who is at R. ) SAM Like old times , sir , seeing Miss Joyce again . I should say Mrs. Bragdon , sir . DOCTOR ( Sternly ) Sam ! ( Crosses R. ) How much have you seen of her maid , Molly , the last year or two ? ( Puts bag and hat on chair down R. ) SAM I saw her with Mrs. Bragdon , sir , at Bar Harbor year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOCTOR ( Coming back to R. of chair R. ) It 's a funny thing how she keeps track of me ! SAM Yes , sir ! DOCTOR Every time I look twice at another woman I turn around and she 's behind me ! p. 32 SAM It might be on account of her being a widow , sir ; they do say widows have a seventh sense ! DOCTOR If I thought for a minute you 'd play any tricks on me , Sam , I 'd get rid of you . SAM Yes , sir , if you ever catch me doing anything that ai n't for your own good , I 'd deserve being fired . ( JOYCE comes to door of cabin and enters gaily . SAM starts for gangplank . ) DOCTOR Where are you going , Sam ? SAM I 'm going to see what 's left of that car , sir . ( Exits C. ) DOCTOR ( As he sees JOYCE ) Wait a minute  --  I 'll go with you . ( Exists . ) ( BILL enters  --  JOYCE crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOYCE Oh , I do feel so much better than I had any right to even hope I 'd feel . BILL That 's good . JOYCE Oh , thank you , Mr.  --  ah  --  ah  --  Bradford , is n't it ? BILL Yes . JOYCE I 'm still just a little shaky you know . So I am going to sit down . ( Sits R. C. ) You could sit down too , Mr. Bradford . p. 33 BILL Thanks , I ca n't sit down . ( He walks up and down miserably . ) JOYCE Been riding ? Or just not feeling well ? BILL It does n't matter . ( Pacing up and down . ) JOYCE You 're a very old friend of Miss Chadwick 's , are n't you ? BILL Yes . JOYCE And of course you 're a great friend of Dr. Waller 's . BILL As a matter of fact , I am not . I do n't like Dr. Waller . JOYCE Oh , but you will when you know him better . BILL After to-night I sha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOYCE Her ? BILL Ruth Chadwick ! JOYCE You loved her ? BILL I do n't see how you guessed that . Let 's not talk about it . JOYCE I know , but after all they 're not married yet . BILL They 're engaged . JOYCE The Doctor has been engaged before . BILL No. p. 34 JOYCE Often . BILL ( Sits C. ) Women are funny . If I were a girl he 'd never attract me . JOYCE Well , I do n't know , it 's hard to say . Love is such a very funny thing , is n't it ? BILL It 's hell ! JOYCE How well you express it . You know , I rather like you , Mr. Bradford . BILL Do you ? JOYCE And I 'm going to give you some advice . BILL What is it ? ( Looks front . ) ( DOCTOR enters and " tiptoes " R. for his hat and bag . ) JOYCE Stick around . ( Sees DOCTOR . ) BILL What ? ( Sees DOCTOR . ) JOYCE Hush  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal in common . ( Sees DOCTOR  --  rises . ) Why , Doctor Waller ! ( TO BILL . ) Good-bye ! BILL Huh ! JOYCE Must you go ? BILL Oh ! Yes . ( Exit to cabin. ) p. 35 JOYCE Well , Doctor Waller ? DOCTOR ( Turns ) Rather an expensive way to gain an introduction , is n't it ? to smash up a perfectly good car ? JOYCE ( Crosses L. Cheerfully ) It 's insured . ( She sits in deck chair . ) DOCTOR You know , of course , that you might have broken you neck ! JOYCE That 's insured , too . DOCTOR ( Crosses to her ) I want you to answer me one question ! JOYCE Jack ! Were n't you the clever thing to pick out a house boat ? DOCTOR Why are you doing this to me ? JOYCE What to you ? DOCTOR How did you get here ? JOYCE Well , my brakes were n't working very well , and the hill was steep and  --  DOCTOR ( Bitterly ) An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd follow you , do you ? DOCTOR And it was an accident your coming to the hotel , there is Bar Harbor , summer before last ? p. 36 JOYCE Oh ! I remember ! What became of the little blonde girl you were having dinner with that night ? DOCTOR ( Crosses and sits deck chair R. C. ) Nothing ! JOYCE Too bad ! DOCTOR And at Placid last summer ? I suppose your coming there was an accident , too ? JOYCE I always did love Placid ! By the way , how 's Maude ? Maude was her name , was n't it ? DOCTOR I never saw her again . JOYCE How awful ! But then you always were fickle ! DOCTOR ( Firmly ) I 've spiked your guns this time ! I 've told Ruth Chadwick the whole story ! JOYCE All of it ? DOCTOR Yes , about you , and about Maude , and about the little blonde girl at Bar Harbor ! JOYCE ( With feeling ) And about the other one ? The real one ? DOCTOR There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please do n't begin that again ! DOCTOR I 'm not beginning anything again , you 're doing that ! p. 37 JOYCE ( Angrily ) Her husband divorced her , and he named you . DOCTOR He did n't name me , and he did n't divorce her , she divorced him ! JOYCE You ought to be ashamed of yourself ! DOCTOR I 've told you , I do n't know how many times , that she was never anything in the world to me but one of my patients ! JOYCE ( Rises  --  crosses C. ) And you used to give her treatments in the Ritz ballroom ! DOCTOR Well  --  ( rises , crosses R. ) I did n't have many patients then , I was n't as busy a man as I am now ! JOYCE But even then you were a heart specialist ! DOCTOR I was a young fool , just out of my two years at the hospital , and I was the happiest man alive , because I thought I had the kind of love you read about in story books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . JOYCE And that hurt , did n't it ? I know , because I found that out too . It 's great to be young , like that , and believe in things  --  it 's funny how they go  --  those things we used to believe in . Of course love has to go  --  the kind of love that love ought to be . p. 38 DOCTOR ( Bitterly ) You 're an expert , ( crosses C. ) I suppose , in the kind of love that love ought to be ? JOYCE I 've tried to be , but there 's one terrible obstacle to a really perfect love , unfortunately there has to be a man in it . DOCTOR It 's the men , I suppose , who are fickle , inconstant , unfaithful ? JOYCE ( Gravely ) Yes , Jack , it 's the men who are unfaithful . ( Crosses R. to chair R. ) DOCTOR From the very first there never was a moment when you ever really trusted me . JOYCE I had a lot of sense for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw me down for a man worth a million . JOYCE You think I did that ? DOCTOR Yes . JOYCE You think I married poor Jim for his money ? DOCTOR Yes . JOYCE You are very bitter ! DOCTOR Bitter ? I did n't want ever to say to you what I am saying now ! Bitter ? If any man had ever hurt me as you hurt me  --  made me suffer as you made me suffer , I 'd have known what to do . But I 've never forgiven you  --  ( Pause . Pulls table away from chair and sits . ) I should n't have said that , I suppose , although I meant every word of it , but it 's a little too much , your coming here like this . ( Sits R. C. ) p. 39 JOYCE Fate plays queer pranks . ( Sits C. ) DOCTOR So do you , but you 've played your last prank on me . JOYCE You were always an optimist . DOCTOR This time I have a right to be . Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How nice ! Tell me all about it . DOCTOR Oh , there is n't much to tell . She came to the office about six weeks ago . JOYCE Another heart case ? DOCTOR Yes , but she 's all right now ! JOYCE You could n't fall ! DOCTOR I was lonely , and miserable . She asked me to call , and I did  --  then came the proposal . JOYCE ( Sweetly ) And you consented ? DOCTOR Yes  --  no ! JOYCE ( Earnestly ) And you love her , Jack ? DOCTOR Yes . JOYCE Are you sure ? DOCTOR Why should you doubt me ? JOYCE Oh , I do n't know , if I remember rightly you thought you loved me once . p. 40 DOCTOR I was just a sentimental idiot . JOYCE ( Pleasantly ) It 's quite remarkable how little you 've changed ! AMBER IN SPOT L. ( RUTH enters . She has changed to a dinner gown ; as she enters she stops in surprise at seeing these two together . ) RUTH Oh ! So nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( DOCTOR rises . ) JOYCE Yes , is n't it ! Do you know I am beginning to wonder if after all I was n't more frightened than hurt . RUTH You really look so very well that I ca n't help wondering if you were so very much of either . JOYCE Your father said that really it did n't matter at all if I did n't dress for dinner . RUTH One could hardly expect that under the circumstances you would have a dinner gown with you . JOYCE Of course not , as a matter of fact I have a suitcase with one or two little things in it . RUTH How fortunate ! Almost a presentiment that something was going to happen to you , was n't it ? JOYCE Well , a great many things have happened to me. p. 41 RUTH ( Coldly ) Since you were engaged to be married to Doctor Waller ? JOYCE ( Rises  --  crosses to RUTH ) Yes , I am so glad he told you about that . It makes everything so much more cozy , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know I do n't think this is even decent ! RUTH My dear Jack ! Are n't you forgetting that affair was over such a very , very long time ago ? JOYCE Well  --  not such a very long time ago . RUTH Four years ! I guess that 's a pretty long time ! DOCTOR Yes . JOYCE Yes , it 's a long time . RUTH And you were married after that . How queer it must seem meeting each other ! Dear me ! How time does change things ! DOCTOR You 're a good sport , Ruth , taking things like this ! I 'm proud of you ! RUTH ( Coldly ) Do n't you think you 'd better go and dress ? DOCTOR Do what ? RUTH Dress ! For dinner ! p. 42 DOCTOR And leave you two out here to talk me over ? RUTH ( Crosses to DOCTOR ) You trust me , do n't you ? JOYCE Why of course he trusts us . DOCTOR Trust you ! JOYCE ( To RUTH ) He really does n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a boy ! Of course he seems rude sometimes , but that 's just a little way he has . RUTH ( Coldly ) Doctor Waller has very good manners ! JOYCE With his lady patients , oh , yes ! He always did ! He was quite famous for it ! I remember once  --  he had a patient  --  a red haired girl with a turned up nose  --  DOCTOR Ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! RUTH Ha ! ha ! ha ! ( They laugh aloud . ) JOYCE I do n't blame you for laughing . She was sight ! About a month after they first met she  --  DOCTOR and RUTH laugh . JOYCE , in surprise . ) Ha ! ha ! ha ! Here ! Wait a minute ! ( Crosses to DOCTOR  --  RUTH crosses L. C. ) I do n't think that 's so very funny . p. 43 DOCTOR ( Gayly ) Oh , no ! No ! Not at all ! Tell more ! Tell more ! JOYCE Tell ? Why , I should n't dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to assume that Miss Chadwick was well acquainted with you ! RUTH Naturally . DOCTOR Of course she is ! JOYCE Of course , I would n't have dreamed of mentioning it if she had n't been . RUTH ( Quickly ) Mentioned what ? DOCTOR It does n't matter ! JOYCE Of course it might have been what he calls his " professional manner . " Some medical men NEVER get it , but really it came quite naturally to him ! If one did n't know better one might think he was really devoted to every single good-looking woman who came into his office ! DOCTOR Ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! Ha ! ha ! RUTH ( Coldly ) What are you laughing at ? ( DOCTOR sits R. C. chair . ) JOYCE Do n't be cross , dear ; after all , has one the right to hamper such a brilliant career as that of a fashionable heart specialist ? p. 44 RUTH But why a heart specialist ? I 've often wanted to know that ! There are diseases enough without picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell him ! I remember he quarreled frightfully with me once just because I asked him to specialize in gout . DOCTOR ( Rises ) Now there 's just one possible way for this thing to end ; I think it would save us all a lot of trouble if I took the first train back to New York ! RUTH ( Crosses to DOCTOR ) You wo n't do anything of the sort ! JOYCE It would be very disagreeable for me to have the feeling that I was the cause of any trouble between you . RUTH You wo n't be ! I should n't dream of allowing anything or anybody to separate us ! You do n't mind my absolute frankness , do you , Mrs. Bragdon ? JOYCE I ca n't tell you how sweet and dear I think it is of you ! DOCTOR Neither can I ! There have been times in my life when I did n't have much faith in the loyalty of any woman . You 've changed all that for me , Ruth , I wo n't forget it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to see how a good sport treats a man . I think I could come nearer forgiving you right now than at any time for many a long day . p. 45 JOYCE Jack , you 're quite a lot stouter than you used to be . ( DOCTOR looks at her and exits L. ) RUTH He did n't hurt you , I hope ? His bitterness , I mean ? ( Sits R. C. ) JOYCE He hates me ! Really hates me ! ( Sits C. ) RUTH W-e-l-l  --  JOYCE Oh , yes , he does . We always fought terribly , and we fought once too often . RUTH About another woman ! What was her name ? JOYCE Legion . RUTH No one in particular ? JOYCE He never seemed to be particular . RUTH We were just talking about you only a few minutes ago . JOYCE Really . I am amazed to learn that he ever thinks of me at all . RUTH Oh , yes . Sometimes in the night , he says he wakes up thinking about you . JOYCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Politely ) A sort of nightmare . p. 46 RUTH You were engaged , he said , for years , off and on . JOYCE Oh , we were frequently engaged . Mother used to call it my bad habit . RUTH And all those times when you were n't engaged . Why were n't you ? JOYCE Well , really , my dear ! RUTH Did you always break you engagement to him for the same reason ? JOYCE Oh , dear , no . She came and went . RUTH She ? I thought so . He 's fickle . JOYCE Fickle ? He 's fluid . RUTH He may have been rather silly at one time . JOYCE ( Sweetly ) You mean when he was engaged to me ? RUTH I mean when he was a boy . He 's a man now . JOYCE And so , of course , he wants a fine strong woman for a wife . How proud you must be , and how happy . RUTH I am proud . I 'm tired of playing around with kids . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . With one exception you are the only clever girl I ever knew him to be devoted to . RUTH You mean you were the other ? p. 47 JOYCE Yes ! I was the other . And I think it is fine your being so sane about everything and so brave . RUTH Thank you . JOYCE Of course a doctor 's wife has to be both . A jealous woman simply could n't marry a doctor . RUTH That 's silly . JOYCE ( Sighs ) Perhaps it is , but I 'm afraid that I always was silly . RUTH Because of his patients ? Oh well , he 's going to take a house with his office right down under my room . JOYCE Oh , do n't ! Do n't ! You could n't bear it . RUTH Why ? JOYCE Well , no doubt you will learn to get used to it . You 'll probably even be nervous when he is shut up in that room , hour after hour with a beautiful woman . RUTH Of course he 'll have a trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you about . Look out for those nurses . RUTH I 've been awfully worried about that . Oh , dear ! Bill said I was a fool . I wonder . Why did n't you marry him yourself ? What made you run away with this other man ? What particular thing did Jack do to make you do that ? p. 48 JOYCE That 's something I ca n't talk about . ( Rises . ) RUTH You 'll have to tell me  --  ( Rises . ) JOYCE I wo n't talk about it . RUTH No matter what it was  --  it ca n't be half as bad as I 'll think it was if I do n't know . JOYCE Oh , ca n't it ? RUTH You do n't mean a bad woman ! JOYCE The worst woman in the world ! RUTH What was her name ? JOYCE Her name was Mrs. Robert Warren . RUTH ( Crosses R to chair ) How do you know ? JOYCE There was a perfectly scandalous divorce case and her husband named Jack . RUTH Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me all about it . ( They sit . ) JOYCE ( Sits table L. of chair ) I read it in the papers and a month after I saw them dancing at the Ritz . RUTH It was terrible for you ! JOYCE Oh , there are men enough . I let him know that he did n't break my heart . I married Jim Bragdon . I was n't going to let him laught at me. p. 49 RUTH ( Firmly ) I shall forgive him ! But after this I 'm going to keep my eye on him . JOYCE I would . And I 'd buy a good pair of glasses . ( PAULA LEA , now in an elaborate dinner gown , enters from cabin ; by now a sunset glow is spreading . BILL enters , after PAULA . ) PAULA What a lovely evening . How much better this is than that stuffy little summer hotel at the Point . ( JOYCE and RUTH rise . As JOYCE sees her she stops suddenly and glares at PAULA . ) RUTH ( Crosses to PAULA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs.  --  ( BILL crosses and sits C. ) JOYCE ( Fiercely ) Oh ! RUTH Mrs. Bragdon , this is  --  JOYCE Mrs. Robert Warren ! RUTH No ! JOYCE Yes . RUTH ( Crosses to JOYCE  --  in horror ) I never heard of such an awful thing in all my life ! ( As RUTH and JOYCE stand looking angrily at PAULA , PETER enters from cabin in dinner coat . PETER is in very high spirits and advances gayly. ) p. 50 PETER Oh ! So nice to see that you 're all friends . JOYCE ( Coldly ) I am sorry , Mr. Chadwick , but I am leaving at once ! ( Crosses up C. and down to R. ) RUTH Just a moment , Mrs. Bragdon ! This lady is engaged to be married to my father . JOYCE Oh ! How terrible ! ( Crosses down R. ) PETER How what ? What are you talking about ? PAULA Really , Peter ! I have never been spoken to like this in all my life ! RUTH Oh yes , you have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of course it is true , Mrs. Robert Warren . ( Above chair C. ) PETER ( Crosses to RUTH ) What ? What ? Who 's Mrs. Robert Warren ? PAULA ( Down C. ) I am , or rather I once was . RUTH She 's a divorced woman ! PETER No ! PAULA It is a very painful subject . I never mention it if I can avoid it , but I thought you knew . p. 51 PETER No ! I do n't know ! PAULA The court allowed me to resume my maiden name . Really , Peter , I was n't in the least to blame . PETER ( Angrily ) Who was to blame then ? RUTH ( Angrily ) Doctor Waller ! ! DOCTOR Yes , dear . Did you call me ? ( Enters  --  in dinner clothes . He comes forward cheerfully , until he sees PAULA , then he stops in horror . ) RUTH ( To JOYCE ) It 's true ! JOYCE Of course it is . DOCTOR Good Heavens ! Do you know this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes down L. back of chair L. ) Do you know her ? ( Crosses to DOCTOR . ) RUTH Does he know her ! JOYCE He does ! RUTH Father ! This woman 's husband named Doctor Waller in his divorce action ! DOCTOR That is n't true ! He did try to drag my name in , out of spite , but she got the divorce ; he didn't. p. 52 RUTH I told Mrs. Bragdon I was going to forgive you , but I 'm not ! Not with her here . DOCTOR ( Crosses to JOYCE ) You made this trouble , Joyce , and you did it on purpose , of course , and I 'm going to give you one chance to make good . JOYCE Four years ago you defended her , you asked me to believe in her  --  I would n't do it then , and I wo n't do it now ! DOCTOR You owe her an apology ! I want you to make it ! JOYCE I 'll die first ! RUTH And so would I ! PETER This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Crosses to RUTH . ) DOCTOR ( To PAULA ) I 'll do that ! Paula , change your dress ! We 'll go at once ! RUTH Go where ? It 's almost night ! JOYCE You ca n't go together ! PAULA ( Crosses L. ) After this , I wo n't stay here . DOCTOR ( Crosses to PAULA ) You are going to marry me , Paula . JOYCE Marry ! ( Crosses C. ) p. 53 DOCTOR I know how little we deserve what these people think ! We owe nothing more to them , any of them ! Will you marry me , Paula ? PAULA Yes , I will ! That 's exactly what I 'll do ! ( DOCTOR and PAULA exit L. ) PETER ( Crosses L. ) They 're really going ! RUTH ( In tears to JOYCE , R. C. ) She 's going to marry him ! What are we going to do ? JOYCE ( C. ) Is n't this exasperating ! Now I 've got to start all over again ! ( PETER exits  --  BILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) @x SCENE : Cabin of " Journey 's End , " a few moments later than the events of the first act . A well furnished cabin , cozy and comfortable , the furniture upholstered in gay colors . At R. four or five carpeted steps go up to the hatchway that opens out to the deck . At L. toward the bow , the scene is set at a slight angle so that part of the interior of staterooms A and B may be seen when the doors open . These two rooms are L. and down-stage of these doors there is a carpeted passage into which the other staterooms are supposed to open . JOYCE has stateroom C. DOCTOR WALLER has room A , the other characters , when going to their rooms , exit down the passage at L. At back of the cabin are two rather large partholes , or windows , at present covered with drawn curtains . CHING , a Chinaman , dressed as " house boy " stands behind bar at L. On the bar is a large bowl of ice , several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit juice . CHING is mixing a fruit cocktail in a silver shaker and the business is so timed that just as he finishes making a cocktail , someone comes along and drinks it . During the entire act he is hard at work , but never gets anywhere ; his cocktail is taken from his before he has time to finish shaking it . Sandwiches on plate and canned fruit are also on bar . A bench-like window seat extends across the back of cabin under the portholes . AT RISE : As CHING shakes away at his cocktails , PAULA enters from L. PAULA Ching ! Will you please mix me a fruit cocktail and bring it to my stateroom ? ( Exits L. ) ( PETER enters and knocks on PAULA 'S stateroom  --  the second one. ) p. 55 PETER Paula ! Paula ! You must speak to me . PAULA ( Inside stateroom ) Go away , please . I have nothing to say . ( PETER crosses to DOCTOR 'S room  --  the first one off stage  --  knocks on the door . ) PETER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opens door ) Well ? PETER I want to talk to you about this marriage . DOCTOR You are my host . I know that , but I 'll be gone in ten minutes . ( Shuts door . ) ( PETER starts R. as CHING starts for cabin with cocktail . PETER takes the cocktail and drinks it . ) PETER Awful ! ( Crosses to R. ) CHING Maybe yes . ( Crosses to bar and starts to mix another cocktail . ) ( BILL enters from R. ) PETER Oh , it 's you ! A fine mess you 've made of things . BILL What have I done ? PETER Well , why did n't you do something ? If you 'd married my daughter this confounded doctor never would have come here . p. 56 BILL Did n't I do my best ? PETER You ought to be ashamed ! Letting him take your sweetheart right out from under your nose . BILL What about you ? He took yours , too , did n't he ? PETER Oh , be quiet ! I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( BILL crosses and knocks on DOCTOR 'S door . ) BILL Dr. Waller ! Dr. Waller ! DOCTOR ( Opens door ) Oh ! It 's you ! BILL I want to say  --  DOCTOR Go away .

Do you happen to know if we are ever going to get any dinner on this boat ? CHING Mebby yes ! ( Starts to mix another drink . ) BILL And " mebby " not ! I wish I was back in New York ! ( He puts the glass down and starts R. but stops angrily as the door of DOCTOR 'S room is opened . In the room DOCTOR WALLER is changing to his business clothes .

BILL Go in there and tell him to come out ! SAM Excuse me , sir , but I 've already had rather a hard day . BILL Then I 'll wait right here if I have to wait all night ! SAM You wo n't have to wait that long . The Doctor is leaving as soon as the lady is ready , sir . BILL He 's not going to leave this boat until I tell him what I want to tell him .

What do you mean , anyway , by standing in front of my door and yelling your fool head off ? p. 58 BILL ( Raises his voice ) I want you to understand that I am an old friend of Miss Ruth Chadwick 's ! DOCTOR ( At archway  --  SAM at doorway . In loud voice ) You 're no such thing ! You 're a young friend of hers , painfully young and badly brought up for your age ! ( The door of room at end of cabin is thrown open showing JOYCE in the doorway . ) JOYCE ( Angrily ) Is it absolutely necessary to make quite so much noise ? Is n't it possible to have a little peace here until I go ? DOCTOR It is n't possible to have any peace anywhere until you do go ! JOYCE ( Angrily ) Oh ! ( She shut the door . ) BILL ( To DOCTOR ) I want to tell you  --  ( CHING starts L. with cocktail . ) DOCTOR Just a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make another .

You 're going to be married in a few minutes . p. 59 DOCTOR Will you do as I told you and go and tell Miss Lea to hurry up ! SAM Yes , sir ! ( Crosses to second door  --  raps and then enters DOCTOR 'S room . ) BILL Are you really going to marry Miss Lea , to-night ? DOCTOR I am ! BILL Then , of course , your engagement to Miss Chadwick is definitely over ? DOCTOR Naturally ! BILL Then I have no more to say . DOCTOR Thank Heavens ! ( They both turn , with dignity , and exit , BILL down passage at L. DOCTOR to his room . As they exit the door of room B is hastily opened . PAULA enters . ) PAULA Ching , will you please hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters down the steps from the deck , he is in a fearful temper and crosses with a scowl .

( At archway  --  holds . ) Is it safe here ? ( Looks at CHING . ) SAM Oh , do n't mind that guy . He ai n't human .

I 've done all I could . If he ever finds out it 's me that 's been telegraphing you every time he 's fell in love I 'm going to be out of luck .

( Crosses to CHING , L. C. ) I want another ! CHING Mebby yes . ( He pours . Comes down to L. of JOYCE . She drinks . Gives CHING glass . CHING crosses up to bar . ) JOYCE If he goes with her to-night he 'll marry her ! You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your place I would n't have said a word about that divorce business to Mr. Chadwick . JOYCE ( Shocked ) You mean you 'd have let Mr. Chadwick marry her without knowing the truth ? SAM What he did n't know would n't have hurt him . If you 'd let her marry Mr. Chadwick the doctor would never have seen her again . JOYCE He 'll marry someone he does n't love to hurt someone that he does . Sam , think of some clever way to keep those two from leaving this boat to-night . We must n't let him do it . SAM Do n't you cry . I 'll do it somehow . ( Crosses L. ) I 'll do it if I have to break both his legs . JOYCE I just hate to have him suffer . Do n't break but one . ( Enter PETER . ) Good-evening , Mr. Chadwick .

JOYCE Of course I am almost a stranger , and I know it is very presumptuous of me to say it , especially to a person older than I am , not that you look old , it is almost impossible to believe you have a grown daughter . PETER ( Coldly ) Mrs. Bragdon , my mind is somewhat confused . I know you 've just said something , but I have n't been able to follow you . JOYCE I am afraid that 's because you lost your temper . ( SAM enters L. with ax  --  crosses and exits R. ) p. 63 PETER Is this what you wanted to say to me , or are you still suffering from the shock of your accident ? JOYCE What I wanted to say was  --  really you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her ? JOYCE Miss Lea , you know . Of course she was Mrs. Robert Warren , but you do n't know how shamefully he treated her ! PETER Do you ? JOYCE Not all the details , but what I say is " why not give her the benefit of the doubt ? " PETER I did n't know there was any doubt . JOYCE About her ? Thousands of them ! What I mean is , after all her husband could n't prove a single thing , and it was to her the judge gave the divorce ! PETER ( Startled ) Oh ! To her ? You 're sure of that ? JOYCE Of course I know how all this took you by surprise , but really I think you went just a little too far . PETER But you are the one who started it ! JOYCE Who ? Me ? PETER A divorced woman !

The more I think about it , the more furious I am with that awful woman ! PETER ( Rises ) Stop right where you are ! Mrs. Bragdon has convinced me that we have all made a terrible mistake . Miss Lea has been unfortunate , but is that any reason why decent people should desert her ? RUTH But , Father ! JOYCE ( Sighs ) You see 's how hard she is . Is n't it just the saddest thing how all women are so cruel to one another ? PETER The judge granted the divorce to her .

PETER Paula ! ( Crosses to chair  --  R. of table and sits . ) I 've been a fool and I 've lost you ! It 's my own fault , and I do n't blame you at all , but I do want you to say that you forgive me , if you can . ( Sits R. of JOYCE . ) PAULA No , Peter ! You hurt me too much . JOYCE She was really very fond of you , you see , very , very fond of you ! PETER ( Humbly ) Oh , no ! No ! I do n't think that . p. 72 JOYCE ( To PAULA ) But you were ! Were n't you ? We might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ! ( She looks at him gravely . ) I 'd had a hard time , I thought it was over ! I thought I was going to have peace , and a quiet sort of happiness with you ! PETER What a fool I 've been ! PAULA And then you all insult me , and turn me out , and Doctor Waller defended me because he is a gentleman ! Oh , I know he does n't love me , but we are both unhappy , both tired of being hurt by people we have learned to love ! A poor sort of romance , but at least there is n't a heart break in it ! PETER If you could only marry me , Paula ! If you could only forgive me and begin all over again ! PAULA ( Rises  --  crosses to front of table  --  L. end ) No ! No ! I do n't see how I can !

( Crosses to up C. ) JOYCE ( Crosses to R. ) You know perfectly well that you did n't want to marry her . You do n't love her and you never did ! If you had I might have forgiven you . What I ca n't forgive is an affair with a woman like that , when you were engaged to me. p. 75 DOCTOR What I do is my own business ! You have n't any right to talk like that ! JOYCE If you 'll deny it , so that I believe you as I never have done , I 'll beg your pardon . There is n't a human being in all history who ever hated anyone as I hate that woman .

I 've got to preserve a little of my self-respect . ( Sits below table L. ) JOYCE Yes  --  and you 've got to preserve your secret ! DOCTOR ( Rises  --  crosses L. ) Secret ! What do you suppose this woman mattered , or any other woman ; that was n't the thing that came between us . JOYCE Of course it was ! DOCTOR ( Sits below table ) It was the tyranny of the thing you called your love for me ! Love ! It was slavery . If you 'd ever loved me , you would have trusted me ! p. 76 JOYCE I was jealous , Jack , because I did love you . The only time a woman ever really trusts a man is when she does n't .

JOYCE ( Humbly ) No excuse at all for the way I  --  ( Then with rising anger . ) You 'd better hurry up , I ca n't stand much of this ! p. 77 DOCTOR ( Gravely ) I used to think I 'd give anything in the world to hear you admit that , but it does n't seem to make much difference now . JOYCE ( Rises  --  crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean that I have been so bad that you do n't ever want to have anything to do with me again ! DOCTOR You were just you , different from any other girl in the world , dearer , sweeter ! JOYCE I 've come back , Jack .

DOCTOR ( Draws back ) One kiss and I 'd be sunk . ( Sits below table . ) JOYCE ( Holds out arms ) Come on , Jack ! Let 's sink together ! ( Sits R. of him . ) DOCTOR ( Bitterly . Rises  --  crosses L. ) No ! I would be just as much a victim of your whims as I was four years ago ! In an hour you 'd begin asking me to repeat to you every word I ever said to Paula Lea ! p. 78 JOYCE ( Rises  --  crosses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name again , excepting once , when , just to please me  --  you 'll swear on the Bible that you never so much as kissed her . DOCTOR I will not ! ( Crosses to up C. ) JOYCE ( Fiercely ) Because you ca n't ! Because she was just exactly what I said ! DOCTOR ( Angrily ) The Judge believed my story . JOYCE I suppose you swore to it ! DOCTOR He granted the decree to her ! JOYCE You perjured yourself for that terrible woman , and you would n't perjure yourself for me ! ( Sits L. of table . ) DOCTOR Stop that ! JOYCE ( Bitterly ) Oh , how right I was ! I knew ! I knew ! Just now , when I thought I might have been wrong I hated myself , now I know ! DOCTOR You do n't know it now any more than you knew it then . You talk about everything being different , where 's the difference ? You 'd rub those four years out , you said . There are things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rises  --  front of table ) Lies ca n't ! DOCTOR Well , here 's another thing you ca n't rub out ! I do n't want the old days back again ! It 's too uncomfortable ! I do n't expect much , but I do want to call my soul my own . JOYCE ( Crosses C. ) You have n't any soul to call your own ! All you want is some woman , any woman , who will put her arms around you and kiss you . DOCTOR Well , I 'd rather have one who would kiss me than one who would scratch my eyes out . JOYCE Who wants to scratch your eyes out ? Who wants to have anything to do with you ? I do n't , Ruth does n't , Paula does n't . Oh , I know you hate me but you do n't hate me one-half as much as I hate you . ( RUTH enters R. ) RUTH Jack ! DOCTOR Just a minute ! I 'm busy ! RUTH Listen to me !

When you asked Paula to marry you to-night , you only did it to protect her  --  and first I broke off my engagement to you  --  then she broke hers . p. 80 DOCTOR I 'm getting used to little things like that . RUTH Nobody has any right to treat you so terribly . I promised to marry you and I 'm going to do it ! DOCTOR You are ! RUTH Of course I am ! Bill wo n't like it , but I 'm no quitter . Do you want me , Jack ? DOCTOR I 've never wanted you so much as I do now .  --  You 've got to marry me right now . RUTH When ? DOCTOR To-night . JOYCE It 's absurd ! It 's silly .

DOCTOR ( Bitterly ) Yes , and you 're so clever and so sharp . But this is one time I think I put it over on you ! I do n't think you 'll stop this marriage ! p. 81 JOYCE Please do n't , Jack ! Do n't punish me like this ! Do n't do the awful thing I did just to try to hurt me ! DOCTOR Hurt you ! I could n't hurt you ! There is n't anything to you to hurt but vanity , and spite , and malice ! You have a heart of course , but it does n't feel ! It does n't suffer ! JOYCE ( Gently ) Doctor , as a heart specialist , you 're a joke ! DOCTOR That 's what I 've always been to you , a joke , but you 've had your last laugh on me ! JOYCE I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much laughing since then . I have cried a little , Jack . I would n't want you to know how much more than a little , because I have been so sorry and so ashamed . I wish you would n't hate me so ! I wish you 'd please try not to hate me ! DOCTOR Why should n't I hate you ? JOYCE I do n't know , I just wish you would n't ! DOCTOR We cared too much once , you ca n't forget a thing like that . I tried , I think I could have forgiven you if you 'd let me alone , but you were bitter , you wanted to keep on hurting me . JOYCE You mean you think I like to hurt you ? DOCTOR I know you do ! p. 82 JOYCE ( Angrily ) Go on and marry her ! You deserve what you 'll get ! DOCTOR In an hour I 'll be married and free !

That stuff about the elephants , you know . I had her eating right out of my hand . JOYCE After this I wonder if Dr. Waller will want his wife to eat out of another gentleman 's hand . BILL What do you mean ? JOYCE Dr. Waller and Ruth . It 's on again . BILL ( Rises  --  crosses C. ) NO ! JOYCE Yes ! p. 83 BILL He wo n't marry her . Not if I have to kill him . JOYCE ( Rises  --  crosses to BILL ) You get good ideas , Bill , let 's try to think of something else . BILL She does n't love him . It 's just romance . Do you know , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOYCE You have an old head on young shoulders . BILL He would n't be true to her for a month . JOYCE A month ! You must n't ask too much of any man , Bill . BILL And I ca n't do anything ! JOYCE How do you know you ca n't ? You can try , ca n't you ? BILL That 's right , she is n't strong enough to hurt me unless I let her . JOYCE Then you must n't let her . I 'll show you what kind of a friend I am . I am going to help you stop this marriage . BILL How can I ever thank you ? JOYCE Do n't thank me ; wait .

BILL They wo n't go ; that 's all there is about it . ( Crosses L. ) JOYCE Go on , Sam , and do n't you fail me . I 'll delay them all I can , but if I ca n't keep them here , Bill will let you know , then you do your darndest , but do n't tell me what it is you are going to do , because it might be my duty to tell you not to do it .

( Rises and gets blanket . ) DOCTOR ( Offended ) It 's natural , is n't it , for a man to think about the woman he is going to marry ? JOYCE ( Crosses back to C. ) If you thought about all the women you 've been going to marry , you 'd have a brainstorm . DOCTOR Of course I think about her , and worry about her . You think she 's all right  --  the rest of them , I mean ? They would n't upset or anything ? JOYCE What would upset them ? I had you in the canoe . DOCTOR I just leaned on the side a minute to take the kink out of my back . JOYCE A minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . ) DOCTOR Do n't do that ! JOYCE Look , Jack ! I found this stove in the Captain 's cabin . We 're almost dry now . DOCTOR But I thought Ruth was to take the canoe . JOYCE Ruth went with Bill . p. 106 DOCTOR Bill ? JOYCE ( Sits at table L. of DOCTOR ) You must n't blame her . She fainted and Bill put her into the dory . DOCTOR I do n't know as I like that . JOYCE Bill did . Are you warmer now ? ( She rubs his forehead . ) DOCTOR Do n't do that ! I hate it ! Do n't baby me . It 's a funny thing about me . I never have any luck with women . JOYCE You scatter your efforts .

JOYCE To music ! She 's perfect ! We 'll admit that . What of it ? DOCTOR I am talking about loving her , or loving any woman , if you know what I mean . JOYCE ( Crosses C. ) Well , what do you mean , if anything ? DOCTOR You do n't mind my talking about it to you , do you ? JOYCE Not at all . It thrills me . ( She sits beside him . ) DOCTOR It is n't often a man and a woman can seriously discuss an important question like that . It gets personal . Of course if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOYCE And that spoils it . DOCTOR Yes . And with a wife a man ca n't really talk over a subject like that . JOYCE She 'd know he was lying . DOCTOR Yes !  --  No ! She would n't know he was lying ! The man simply would n't want to hurt her ! p. 108 JOYCE Why ? Is n't the man normal ? DOCTOR I 'm the man ! And I guess I 'm normal . JOYCE Abnormally normal . DOCTOR Now we 've known one another always . You 've been married and you 're a widow . We can talk sensibly , without getting personal . What 's between us is between us  --  memories  --  Heaven knows you could n't bring them back to life , and that 's that ! JOYCE Yes , that 's that . DOCTOR Now this love business ? There 's a lot of bunk in it ! JOYCE Is there ? DOCTOR I think so , do n't you ? JOYCE Do n't ask me what I think ! I 'm just sitting here learning things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love is . It 's a fever ! It 's an unhealthy symptom ! JOYCE ( With sympathy ) And you are so dreadfully exposed to contagion in your office ! DOCTOR ( Coldly ) We are not discussing my office . JOYCE Of course not ! We are talking about love . ( She looks at him tenderly. ) p. 109 DOCTOR Impersonally ! JOYCE Naturally . What did you say it was  --  an unhealthy symptom ? DOCTOR I do n't know how many nights I 've sat , these last few years , and thought about you . JOYCE Jack ! DOCTOR ( Sadly ) About what a mistake the whole thing always was . JOYCE Always ? DOCTOR Yes . We were never happy for more than an hour or so at a time . JOYCE That 's something . DOCTOR Four years is a long stretch ; what awful fools we were ! It 's hard to believe that for two or three minutes , there on the boat we were mad enough to think we actually might come back together again . JOYCE We  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you threw me over , I was sick , sort of numb . I could n't get used to being without you . Then , after about a year , I began to realize you would n't have done what you did if you 'd ever really cared for me . JOYCE And then you were all right ! DOCTOR I was , but I did n't have sense enought to know it ! p. 110 JOYCE Love had grown to be a sort of a habit with you , like being engaged to some girl or other . DOCTOR If you mean Paula , my offer to marry her was simply an act of courtesy . JOYCE A gentleman could do no less ! DOCTOR And the affection between Ruth and myself is , in part , the feeling between a parent and a child . JOYCE Which is the child ? DOCTOR Of course , after Ruth and I are married , everything may be all right . I hope so . I do hate to be all stirred up . JOYCE ( Sweetly ) I wonder if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOYCE ( Fiercely ) Come on back in the water with me and see what I do to you ! DOCTOR I 'm going to sleep ! JOYCE ( Rises ) Going to sleep ! Do n't you even want to know where you are ? DOCTOR I 'm here ! ( He stretches himself out comfortably . ) JOYCE I suppose it would be best to stay here until sunrise . We 'll have to sleep here , Jack  --  the cabin 's under water . p. 111 DOCTOR I 'm tired . ( He unlaces his low shoes and kicks them off . ) And there 's about a pint of water in each of my shoes . I do hate to get my feet wet . JOYCE You 're cold ! Here ! This blanket is almost dry . ( She crosses and covers him with the blanket which she has placed on stool R. of chair R. ) DOCTOR Here ! ( He sits up angrily and throws the blanket off . ) Behave yourself ! JOYCE What ? DOCTOR You take that blanket and cover yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start mothering me because I ca n't stand it ! JOYCE ( Coldly ) Do you know I think I was a little bit impulsive when I saved your life ? DOCTOR When you 're impulsive , you 're generous , and brave . You always were . It 's when you begin to plan and scheme that you get dangerous . JOYCE ( Crosses C. ) I am not sure that is n't true , but I am not going to plan and scheme any more , not about anything . I promised that to myself out there , when I was trying to get us both to shore  --  like a vow , or a prayer . " Help me , and I 'll be good . Let me do this thing and it 's all I ask . Just let me do this one thing and I 'll be satisfied . " Did you ever pray , Jack ? p. 112 DOCTOR Oh , I suppose so  --  I do n't remember . JOYCE It 's still being done , you know , even among quite nice people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a little sensitive about interfering with your affairs . DOCTOR I remember once I prayed  --  one time ! JOYCE ( Crosses to him ) When ? DOCTOR One time ! JOYCE When ? ( Sits . ) DOCTOR The night you ran off with Jim Bragdon ! JOYCE ( Startled ) You prayed ? DOCTOR To forget you ! To stop loving you . JOYCE ( Gently ) I wish you had n't told me that . DOCTOR I did n't mean to hurt you . JOYCE It 's did n't mean to hurt you . JOYCE It 's all right . DOCTOR It 's queer how we 've always gone on , hurting one another every time we came together . What a darned good thing it is we had sense enough to call the whole thing off ! JOYCE Oh , go to sleep , you 're getting tiresome . ( Rises. ) p. 113 DOCTOR Put that blanket over you . JOYCE I do n't want it . DOCTOR Do as I tell you ! JOYCE What ? DOCTOR Just because I ca n't swim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do as I tell you ! Put that blanket around you and lie down and keep quiet , if you can ! ( Rises , crosses R. ) JOYCE Yes , Jack . ( Sits C. She puts the blanket around her . DOCTOR crosses to chair and sits R. For a moment there is quiet . ) Jack ! DOCTOR ( Half asleep ) Well ? JOYCE You 're not sleeping ! DOCTOR Uh ! JOYCE Jack ! DOCTOR Be still ! JOYCE Do you remember the summer we went up into the Maine woods with Father ? ( DOCTOR yawns . ) And we got lost and had to stay out all night under that big tree  --  and you were so sweet to me , and so gentle  --  we were funny kids , were n't we ? DOCTOR ( Going to sleep ) Er ! p. 114 JOYCE And you did n't even kiss me ! You were wonderful , but I do remember thinking you were just the least little bit of a fool ! Jack ! Jack ! ( He does not answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeps . She turns and picks up the blanket and covers him tenderly . ) Oh , my dear ! My dear !

I 'm going to keep her away from him after we 're married if I have to buy a dog . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Just out of curiosity , I 'd like to know what all you women see in him . If you were to ask me , I 'd tell you that he just never happened at all . RUTH He would n't do what you did . ( Crosses C. ) Pick me up when I was unconscious and put me in a boat and take me away when I did n't want to go . It 's all your fault that those two were left alone together . BILL ( Crosses to her ) I did n't trust him and I could n't let you drown . p. 116 RUTH You were wonderful all night long . Brave and fine ! But of course , you always were . You do n't expect me to get any thrills out of that , do you ? BILL Oh , no ! If I was a big , selfish , thick-headed boob , I suppose you 'd be crazy about me . RUTH Hush !

BILL Well , I 'll be hanged ! RUTH Of course she would be there ! It would have been heavenly if I 'd been there in that canoe with him . He 's a hero ! BILL I thought this bird was absolute zero .

Of course now I think more of him than I ever did before . But I do n't think such an awful lot at that . RUTH Hush ! Keep your voice down . BILL I 'm going to find out where we are . ( Crosses up C. ) You stay here till I get back . And when I come back , is it really going to be good-bye ? ( No answer . ) You 're going to marry him ? ( No answer . ) Oh , darn !

( Sits chair C. ) RUTH I do . ( Sits on bench C. ) JOYCE You may be right . And that gives me quite a wonderful idea . I always did think that it was more than one woman could possibly do . Really understand a man . But why should n't we two women do it ? RUTH What do you mean ? JOYCE Form a sort of syndicate . You and I together . I will tell you all I have found out about him and you can profit by it . RUTH Do you really think I could ? JOYCE Why not ? RUTH Go on ! Tell me some of the things he really likes about a woman . JOYCE Make a baby of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like things like that but he really does . Watch him all the time . Tell him not to get his feet wet . And if he gets cross , just stroke his forehead for him , gently . You 've no idea what it does to him . RUTH Oh , thank you ever so much . p. 120 JOYCE Do n't thank me . Run right over to him , dear , and wake him up with a kiss . RUTH Will he like that ? JOYCE He 'll love it .

RUTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose to make trouble between us ? DOCTOR Of course she did ! RUTH And that is n't all she did . I made Bill tell me . When I fainted away and could n't defend myself , she made Bill put me into a nasty leaky little boat and she stayed behind with you . DOCTOR ( Rises , crosses to JOYCE ) So you were the one who sent her off with Bill , were you ? JOYCE ( Crosses C. ) Well , suppose I did ! I thought that was the safest thing to do . p. 123 RUTH It 's no use your thinking I 'll ever forgive you . Think of the difference . I did n't have my life saved . I did n't have any adventure at all . All I did all night long was sit on a wet seat and bail out the boat . ( Sits chair C. ) JOYCE You were lucky ! DOCTOR Well , do n't worry about it . RUTH Oh , dear ! I wish I had some breakfast . ( Rises , crosses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S bag ) That reminds me . Look ! Do you know what he did last night when the canoe tipped over ?

( R. of DOCTOR . ) DOCTOR Of all the things you 've ever done to me , this is the worst . RUTH Worst ? I think she was very considerate . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Considerate ? ( Rises  --  leaves bag on chair C. ) They meant a lot to me . I loved those instruments . JOYCE Of course he did ! Think of all the beautiful patients he 's pawed over with those spy glasses . RUTH Ha ! Ha ! I 'm glad they sunk . DOCTOR Do you know I 'm a fool to worry my head off about women ? There is n't a bit of difference between them . JOYCE ( Referring to bag ) Have a sandwich , Jack ? DOCTOR ( To JOYCE ) No , I 'll starve first . RUTH They 're awfully good . p. 125 DOCTOR ( To RUTH ) Be quiet . I 'm disgusted with you both . RUTH Well , you need n't be so cross . DOCTOR ( Crosses up C. ) Let me alone , ca n't you ? Go away , both of you . I do n't like you ! I 'm through with all women .
