Diamond Lil . Propped up under the armpits by a dress that might have been designed by the stage carpenter , Mae West played the role that she had written about a bygone queen of Manhattan 's underworld . Diamond Lil was a harlot whose heart was as big and golden as the enormous swan shaped bed that stood in her elaborate cubicle above Gus Jordan 's saloon and brothel . None the less , she was hardboiled ; when a Salvation Army captain came to save her soul , she planned to seduce him and when a lady threatened a double cross , Diamond Lil stabbed her in the tenderloin district . Despite her efforts , Gus Jordan , the bowery boss , is caught eventually , for white slave trafficking . The Salvation Army captain , really a member of the police force , is his captor ; Diamond Lil cuddles into his arms at the end saying , " Boy , I knew you could be had . ' ' <P> Actress West plays her heroine with an eloquent and minatory calm , which contrasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are oldtime tough songs , outmoded slang words ( " moll , " " dick , " " corset " ) , and singing waiters , one of whom yodels , in the musty barroom , the same song with which he recently amused Manhattan cabaret patrons . Diamond Lil is an entertaining melodrama . <P> <P> Volpone . When the Theatre Guild wanted to play Ben Jonson 's sardonic comedy , they chose to retranslate the German version recently effected by Stefan Zweig . Their choice was wise . As rewritten by an up-to-date European , Author Jonson 's somewhat mechanical morality becomes a gleeful and raucous farce , lacking the solemnity of a classic and imbued instead with precisely the caustic and colloquial violence which it had for its original audiences* in 1605 . <P> Volpone+ is a money-hugging voluptuary who lies in bed groaning and pretending to be dying . Seeing him so , his companions in coin-clutching , each hoping to be made his heir , come to his bedside bearing gifts and ready to commit other offices of friendship . Volpone 's assistant in deception is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaping a rich harvest until Volpone attempts to perform rape upon a friend 's wife , sent to him for no better reason . Tried in court for this offense and adjudged innocent , Volpone tries another wily and audacious rascality , one which leads to his own undoing . Mosca , always a step ahead of his miserly master , makes himself Volpone 's heir . Not , however , heir to his avarice ; Mosca opens Volpone 's chest and as the curtain falls he is throwing golden coins , by the handful , out of the window , into the world . Volpone is Dudley Digges . Mosca is Alfred Lunt ; out of a flawless cast , he seemed merry and at ease in this old , delicious play . <P> <P> * Or for play-goers a half-century later , of whom one , Samuel Pepys , called it " A most excellent play , the best , 1 think , I ever saw . . . .
