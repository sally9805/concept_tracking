When , in 1815 , Napoleon I was a prisoner on the British warship Bellerophon , thousands of sturdy Britons flocked to Plymouth Harbor in the hope that the Ogre might show himself on deck . When , last week , two Napoleons of U. S. finance reached London on a diplomatic , but controversial errand , they were regarded with less hostility but with almost as much curiosity . " American Millionaires in Kingsway , " headlined the London Standard , " Sir Hugo Meets the United States Giants , " cried the London Evening News . Much has Britain lately worried concerning the U. S. Money ; now Yankee Doodle had certainly come to town . <P> The " Millionaires , " the " Giants , " were Jobless Herbert Bayard Swope and Lawyer Thomas Lincoln Chadbourne . As students of finance know , they had come to London to combat the recent decision ( TIME , April 1 ) of British General Electric Co. , Ltd. , to restrict a forthcoming stock issue to British citizens exclusively . This plan aroused much opposition on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denounced Sir Hugo Hirst , British G. E. 's managing director , as " a super-patriot of German origin " - the reference being to the fact that Sir Hugo , though now a Britisher , was born in Munich . So Sir Hugo , discovering himself to be an unpopular minority , postponed the issue , pending conferences with representatives of his U. S. shareholders , who own some 60% ( nonvoting ) of present British G. E. stock . It was for these conferences that Stockholders ' Representatives Chadbourne and Swope came to London , and it was their visit to Sir Hugo 's offices in Magnet House , Kingsway , that prompted the Standard 's headline . Said the reporters , breathless : <P> " Passersby in the Kingsway stopped and stared when these two arrived at Magnet House . There was little of the American in Mr. Swope 's appearance . He has rimless eyeglasses . . . . Mr. Chadbourne had to bend almost double as he got out of his car . . . .

Dollars rolled merrily along on motive power furnished by many a U. S. Dime . For Lawyer Chadbourne and Jobless Swope , officially designated as representatives of U. S. shareholders in British G. E. , had ceremoniously assessed each shareholder whose authorization they carried the sum of 10 per share to pay expenses of the journey . <P> But though the British public learned many new facts concerning U. S. financiers , neither the British nor the U. S. public could squeeze information out of the official communiques concerning the Hirst-Chadbourne-Swope meetings . The first report said that " no conclusion was arrived at at this morning 's amicable meeting . " Further meetings were delayed when Mr. Chadbourne was taken with a chill . It is known , however , that Sir Hugo has proposed a compromise arrangement by which U. S. shareholders can exercise their rights in the new issue , provided that they sell their new shares within ten weeks . This arrangement permits U.
