txt Some delicate points in regard to the evidence of the nostrils in liquor cases have been raised In Boston . Prohibition agents raided certain premises in Malden . Counsel for the defense argued that the search warrant issued for the raid was imprOper because the affidavits upon which it was obtained asserted that the agents , 150 feet away from the premises , could smell " rectification and distillation of liquor . " Other witnesses , on the premises at about the same time , could " smell nothing in particular . " The Assistant United States Attorney made an interesting argument as to the comparative value of the testimony of expert and amateur smellers : Dogs and other animals rely a great deal on smell and are guided very often by the sense of smell . Men who went for the purpose of discoving evidence of an offense made it their business to investigate , and , because of their experience and knowledge of the smell of liquor , were in a better position to recognize the smell of rectification and distillation than were the witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other purposes .

Does n't some fragrance or Malodor , treasured up in the unconscious from childhood , titilate the nostrils in dreams or even in waking hours ? The most exquisite wine is tasted really with the nostrils . However that may be , is testimony of what a man ca n't recall valid testimony ? If prohibition agents are to qualify as expert osmologers , the condition of their smelling apparatus on the day when it got the evidence must be investigated . Can it be ? They may have shad catarrh . Their mucous membrane may have been dry . Perhaps they were not able to smell on the day of the raid . They may have been victims of a hallucination . About - to enter a supposed cache of rum , they may have unconsciously smelled what they expected to Smell . The defendant 's wife might have been boiling soap .
