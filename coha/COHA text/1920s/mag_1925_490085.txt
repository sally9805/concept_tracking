The Ordeal of Michael Arlen THE NEW YORKER has frequently wondered ? times , for instance , during 1924 alone exactly what sort of paces a visiting literary lion may be expected to be put through . Whereupon there has come , obligingly enough , Mr. Michael Arlen , of Mayfair , to serve as paradigm . Mr. Arlen is about to return to his English shores  --  he has reserved a cabin on the Olympic on its April 18 sailing  --  and it is to be expected that very few of his writing compatriots in London will venture Americawards after he reports on the ritual to which he was subjected . This ritual , if you are a Doran author , and ever so many are , you know , involves the reasonably constant chaperonage , at tea time , of John Farrar , who has in recent weeks added a sort of executive- editorship of Doran 's publishing interests to his duties , as editor of the Bookman . It was Mr. Farrar who summoned the retainers to several of the teas hastily arranged in Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phonees to come by a repeated and mysterious assurance that Arlen was younger than he , Farrar . Mr. Arlen , too , has been admitted into the game known as meeting Miss Elsie de Wolfe . This game has been going on for years in New York circles , but Mr. Arlen providently arrived at a moment when fresh talent was rapidly becoming essential . Mr. Arlen , thus , during the first two weeks of his New York stay , has been privileged to attend no fewer than three gatherings for which the engraved summonses of invitation specified that there was to be meeting of Miss de Wolfe . ( Miss de Wolfe , by the way , has been very kind to Mr. Arlen , as indeed she is to most people , and the business of meeting her all over again in New York must have seemed particularly curious to him since it was not so long ago that he met her in Rome . ) This issue of THE NEW YORKER , unfortunately , goes to press too early to permit a detailed account of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Randolph Hearst , for which Jesse Lasky gracefully supplied him with a gypsy costume by having a handsome suiting of le Valentino 's cut down to fit . During his days here , what with the presence of Jesse Lasky in town too , Mr. Arlen has arranged to do some movie work in the coming Fall . He will , thus , on his return in September or October tarry but briefly in New York for the opening here of " The Green Hat " and depart eagerly for the distant spaces of Hollywood , there to adjust his ideas into adequate scenario form for Miss Pola Negri , whose Mayfair was in Warsaw . Mr. Arlen early in his American visit learned a piece of social usage that has stood him in good stead . This has involved , upon introduction to any stranger , his saying rapidly , " Did n't I meet you at tea , " whereupon the gratified stranger murmurs yes and has become a friend for life . This stratagem is said to have suggested itself to Mr. Arlen when he noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was around two hundred . The business of becoming a friend for life , above-mentioned , is a piece of literary exaggeration . As a matter of fact , THE NEW YORKER has regretfully re record that it has seldom seen as atrocious behavior and lack of fundamental good manners as has characterized a large proportion of the people who have been brought forward to meet Mr. Arlen . Seemingly ignoring the fact that there was no law compelling their attendance at functions in Mr. Arlen 's honor , ever so many persons have come to his parties with an axe rather awkwardly concealed about them . For its part , THE NEW YORKER has found Mr. Arlen a clever and very likable person , happily not too much in love with himself and even more happily not given over to the delusion that he must apologize for his excellent stories and behave as if he did n't regard them as an accomplishment . As well by its very nature as by the environment that the Dorans and others who profit out of him chose to give him , Mr. Arlen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquitted himself excellently . THE NEW YORKER is glad that he has been with us and has made a note to borrow and read his books . It will not be forgotten that he has not lectured . THE radio has complicated the art of after-dinner speaking . Henry L. Stimson , former Secretary of War , was just getting into his stride as toastmaster at the recent dinner of the Academy of Political Science in the Hotel Astor , when an anguished master of ceremonies tugged at his coat tails . Secretary of Commerce Hoover , the principal speaker , was scheduled to talk to the diners by radio from Washington at 9 o'clock . It was then one minute to nine , and the air time and tide wait for no man . So Mr. Stimson had to cut short his own remarks , a little worse than death to any toastmaster , and quickly introduce the invisible speaker . Mr. Stimson sat down and the audience began to applaud as if Mr. Hoover were present in person . They stopped suddenly , as if realizing he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few seconds , interrupted by much coughing that might better have been saved up for some theatre . Mr. Hoover 's voice came through a loud speaker for fifteen minutes . The applause at the end was a bit constrained . There is no record as to whether Mr. Stimson applauded . Pour le Cheese Sandwich AS a sweeping reaction to such institutions as the Monday Opera Club and the like , there has recently come into being an association whose founders clearly realize that it is not that the afore-mentioned guilds reflect a too patrician tone , but , on the contrary , that they fail to do so at all . The result , after mouths of the most arduous debate and dissection , has ultimately appeared in the shape of the Club de France at d'Angleterre , located  --  one flight up -- -in the MHnnerchor Hall , in East Fifty-sixth Street , just off Third Avenue . On handsomely engraved brochures  --  to be obtained only from the governors or their secretaries  --  a brief outline of the organization 's policy and regulations is outlined . An extract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club de France et d'Angleterre is the most exclusive supper club in the world . The Board of Governors have blackballed everyone but themselves . The object of the club is to establish a supper place in New York where one may eat a Swiss cheese sandwich in peace and quiet . " Any guest who mentions mah jong , polo , the tango , vintage champagne , winter sports , new Paris restaurants or the latest mode in white evening waistcoats will be promptly kicked out . These topics are reserved for the waiters . " All guests planning to make speeches of more than fifteen minutes in length must submit same three days in advance to the Board of Governors . " While the predominating air of the club is social and artistic , the windows will nevertheless be kept open . " It will be noted that the club is situated conveniently to the Third Avenue elevated and surface lines . Guests wishing to show off a bit may obtain twenty-cents-a-mile taxicabs in front of the saloon at the corner . " Male members of European royal families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club rooms at any time . They may not , however , invite guests save under the provisions set forth in Rule 62 , Clause B. " The swimming pool will be available from 3:30 a.m. to 5 a.m . " All complaints should be registered with the 31st Precinct Police Station , telephone Rhinelander 2900 . The sergeant 's name is Mr. Murphy . " THE head chef , Oscar Katzjen , formerly of the Savoy , Larue 's , and the Cafe Schwarzenberg , was , during the late war , kept in hiding by a group of philanthropists who well appreciated the value of so superb a master of the gastronomic art , and has , as a favor to his benefactors , remained in the United States ever since . Among his specia/itis are Caille Cocotte Armenienne ; noisette of veal , served with crushed strawberries and wild rice ; crab flakes a la Katzjen , buried in whipped cream ; cherry and persimmon omelette ; diamond back terrapin with a rich , Roquefort cheese dressing ; Aiguillette of swordfish , d'Angleterre ; breast of partridge cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaga grapes ; cepes sautes , Bordelaise ; Brochette of minced capon , garnished with blackberries and pearl onions and his world-renowned " plat au casserole " ? a concoction of whitebait , sauerkraut , gauva jelly , hard-boiled eggs , pistache ice cream , broccoli , steamed clams and red caviar . Etienne Deschalles is the head-waiter , a polished , intelligent fellow of thirty nine and erstwhile maitre d'hotel at Foyot 's , while his stalwart lieutenant is Heinrich Schm31 of the far-famed Kempinski 's . Heinrich , incidentally , is a third cousin of the late Kronprintz Friedrich . Every so often is Gala Night at the Club , during which occasion the governors and their inTited guests participate in such forms of terpsichorean divertissements as the Lulu Fado , La Jots , the Argentine Tango and the Viennese Waltz . Top hats are invariably worn during the dancing , and removed only upon the arrival of the punch . This brew is served , usually late , amid considerable ado , the bowl ( a colossal golden affair ) being borne upon a huge silver platter by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Precisely what the ingredients of the punch may be is known to no one , save three of the Board , who mix it , themselves , and not infrequently some doubt will be expressed by one or two of these as to the exact components of the libation . However , it has been definitely ascertained that , among other factors , the juice of one hundred and forty oranges , seven pineapples , the hearts of half a dozen alligator pears , twenty-two carrots , three and a quarter pounds of raisins , and five drops of Peruna are employed in its manufacture . RIOR to the parade through the streets to the Club 1 ? a custom inaugurated since the inception of the organization  --  there are small , informal gatherings in the rooms , apartments or houses of certain governors , during which unofficial rendezvous new and strange potations are invented and passed upon . Rudesheimer ' 88 is mixed with cointreau Triple-Sec , and ChateauLaffite ' 77 with orange curacao . Chablis and chartreuse are shaken together , and from the same goblet one sips Mouton-Rothschild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conti and Jamaica rum , Perrier-Jouet and Creme de Framboises are even known to have been employed as favorite combinations , though , perhaps , the most popular of all is a well-frapped mixture of Benedictine , the white of an egg , and Kirshvasser , with a dash of absinthe , The Board of Governors is composed of Bradford Norman , Jr. , Worthington Davis , Charles H.

Chambers , Conde Nast , Martin 13 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THERE is , in the order named , consternation , excitement and controversy in Tenth Street , Flushing , Rye and Westchester among Dutch Treaters and their wives . As is not too well known , the Dutch Treat is a club made up of authors , sculptors , editors , artists and Rupert Hughes , which meets every Tuesday on the mezzanine floor of the Hotel Martinique , there to listen to speeches , music , wise cracks and what not . Every year , moreover , for the last fifteen years , the Dutch Treat has given a show , written , composed , acted and sung by the authors , writers , editors and sometimes actors and singers who are members of the club . These shows , be it known , have been stag shows in the ultimate meaning of the word . Last year , thus , Mr. Coolidge was among those present , but he did n't laugh much . Recently Frederick Dayton had a big idea . Why not , was its drift , give an invitation performance  --  soon after the regular show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their aunts ? Why not indeed ? The invitations have been out for some time . The annual dinner and show will be held at the Waldorf-Astoria on Friday night of this week and the invitation performance , for the bride and bairn , on Sunday night , at the Lyceum Theatre . Complications set in less than ten hours after the dispatch of the invitations . For the most part , according to an accurate stenographic transcript , the developments have been about as follows ; " I think it would be very nice and I 'm sure Miss Madden will come in to stay with the children so that I can go with you . It 's about time they invited the wives to one of these things . But George , you 've often told me that you ca n't bear to see a show twice , so if we 're both going Sunday night , there 's no sense to your going first Friday , without me . " However . ? . By what is still called a happy coincidence the Fakirs Ball has been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dutch Treat show . The generic George , afore-mentioned , has been in the habit of attending the dinner and show first and then of dropping in at the Fa-kirs , where till dawn there have al-ways been many gay spirits in what has not been overdescribed as " a veritable fairyland of color and music . " And happily , the show has always lasted long enough to make the last train out for commuting Dutch Treaters an impossibility . Now all of this is in danger and placid Dutch Treaters , who have regarded at least one night a year as sacred to themselves , are forming automatically into posses and hunting the highways and byways for Mr. Dayton , who thought it all out so carefully . In addition to which it is becoming increasingly difficult , as rehearsals continue , for some of the actors to remember whether their lines are the ones they are to use for the stag Friday or the Sunday show . Both shows , it is safe to say , will be very funny . THE NEW YORKER has a correction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Racquet Club . It seems , thus , that it is not accurate to say that the celebrated Old King Cole of Maxfield Parrish  --  or , if you prefer , the celebrated Maxfield Parrish of Old King Cole  --  is in an abandoned warehOuse . It is , to be exact , an ornament of the Racquet Club . THE Eminent Clubman left his club recently at three o'clock in the morning and waited grimly for a taxicab to take him home . It was raining and whole bucketsfull of life-giving water poured off his hat and into his ears as he thought carefully of the $30o bet he had recklessly made in the belief that the man next to the dealer was bluffing . A red-flagged taxi approached , one of the thirty-cent a mile kind , but he waved it away angrily . The deluge was filling his shoes and pneumonia germs were scouting cheerLove Laughs at Locksmiths fully about him , as there came into his eyes a look of mild regret that he should always consider tens back to back a sure-fire thing . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had the effrontery to approach , and the Eminent Clubman sent it on its way with a curse , trying to pierce the cloud-burst for a view of a policeman to whom to relate the story of the attempted extortion . There was no policeman in sight , and so he fell into a reverie , dealing largely with that last big consolation pot , in which he had lost $22o because he had split his openers . . . . And then a twenty-cent a mile taxicab appeared and the Eminent Clubman , who had half a mile to go , leaped gratefully into it , with his clothes as soaked as a Yale boy after a football victory over Harvard .
