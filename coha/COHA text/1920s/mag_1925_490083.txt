The Key to the Padlocks OUR Prohibition Authority does n't think much of Emory C. Buckner 's tilt with couched padlock against New York 's supper clubs . And this is why : Well , said our Prohibition Authority , if I was a promising young attorney and I could have my name plastered on every first page in the country for the nominal personal expenditure of $1,50o , I would dash right out and grab the advertising . I would n't even bother , any more than Mr. Buckner did , to dip into the ample fund the United States Government provides for the purpose of procuring evidence against violators of the Volstead Act . I 'd pay the liquor bills for my friends out of my own purse , said our Prohibition Authority . Now you may think I am unjust in hinting that Mr. Buckner knew a good story , for him , when he saw it , said our Prohibition Authority , but the facts I know all point that way . There are plenty of important tax suits , involving millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prohibition Authority , and they are still waiting . And most of the more prominent places against which Mr. Buckner and His Four Volunteer Horsemen procured evidence had had evidence procured against them before he took office , by the Prohibition Enforcement Unit . The legal machinery had begun working on them months ago , but quietly , for the express purpose of providing an outlet for Yale and Towne 's padlocks , said our Prohibition Authority . And if you do n't believe Mr. Buckner wants publicity , commented our Prohibition Authority , I will tell you that the first rule he promulgated on taking office was that none of his assistants might talk to reporters . All news has to come from Mr. Buckner , which means that Mr. Buckner runs first in advertising and his underpaid assistants nowhere , said our Prohibition Authority . Mr. Buckner has done nothing new , said our Prohibition Authority , except make some promises which experience should have told him could not he fulfilled . He can not close a supper club or speakeasy within thirty days after getting evidence against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ca n't make Pike 's Peak in high gear driving a flivver , said our Prohibition Authority . And you must remember that Mr. Buckner served his apprenticeship as an Assistant District Attorney under Charlie Whitman , who also knew a good story , for him , when he saw it . He knew a good story so well that he became governor , and Mr. Buckner could not help observing how it all happened . And every newspaper still has a first page , murmured our Prohibition Authority . I recall the thrilling drive a year or more ago against supper clubs , continued our Prohibition Authority , during which padlocks were applied to the front doors of a bootlegger 's dozen of the more prominent places in town . But when the muck of printer 's ink had dried , it was found that the owners of those places were praying most devoutly that their establishments would be closed , for reason of finance and prestige . And Broadway chuckled at the expense of the Government . Broadway is chuckling now , concluded our Prohibition Authority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most as a result of Prohibition : the oversized beauties who reclined so rosily about the walls of the Hoffman House taproom , or Old King Cole 's colorful and jolly attendants , who answered the call for pipe and bowl in the mural above the Knickerbocker Bar ? Where the Hoffman House canvases have gone , none seems to know . The King Cole mural , when last heard of , was reposing disconsolately in the gloom of a warehouse . It was proposed once that Mr. Vincent Astor present it to the Coffee House , but the wall space of that club was too scanty for proper hanging . These Art Balls SPEAKING of odd jobs , which nobody was until this very minute , some of our bright young men are making a very nice thing , indeed , by promoting Art balls . It is strange how many people contrive excellent livings from Art , except artists . Exemption is granted the Illustrators ' dance , the Beaux Arts ball and such-like functions conducted by real daubers in paint or pen and inkers and whose profits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bludgeon is being dulled , in this instance , for appropriate laying over the heads of very privatelypromoted balls , Greenwich Villagy dances and their like , which are conducted solely for the profit of the financial geniuses who stand deep in the shadows cast by the very arty posters advertising their affairs . The joy is taken out of such functions because no limit is put on the number of tickets sold , consequently dance floors are crowded far beyond their capacity ; so crowded that a lady costumed as a canned sardine at a late masque was smothered in the crush . The Kit Kat Ball , fifteen years or so ago , was an artist 's ball . Such lights as Raleigh and Reuterdahl then stepped a nifty polka , or whatever they did , at the annual affairs . But of late years the dancers have been chiefly bond salesmen and their sweeties ; butter-and-egg men and their wares ; insurance agents ; cloak and suit boys and the out-of-town buyers ; great hearts from Dubuque , and the inevitable Man from Yonkers . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , but he has since been restored to good standing among his fellows because of his explaining he thought he was somewhere else . Home Problems in Hollywood CHARLIE CHAPLIN is in trouble again . Over his head hangs a sword that was forged in the Californian sunshine of the cold metal that entered the souls of the native sons when they lived in Kansas , Iowa and Nebraska . It is the sword of righteousness , the flaming blade of moral indignation . It seems that Mr. Chaplin 's home life has been a trifle irregular  --  and irregularity in Los Angeles , the City of Homes , is unpardonable . As the newspapers have already indicated , a moderately interesting but to whom ? ? event is expected in the old Chaplin manse , and when that event occurs , the sword will descend with a glittering flash and the head that wears the battered derby may roll into the basket of oblivion . Chaplin , according to present plans , is to be driven out of the movies , out of the Golden State , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fatty Arbuckle . . . . When Chaplin was producing " The Kid , " six years ago , he engaged for a minor role in that picture a young girl named Lilita McMurray . The girl played the bad angel in the dream scene wherein Charlie himself fluttered through Heaven , and her mother , for some reason , was named Mrs. Lillian Spicer . Mrs. Spicer , casting envious eyes at Jack Coogan , 1tere , who had leaped to fame and fortune through the activities of his offspring in " The Kid , " went to Chaplin and asked that something be done for her gifted little girl . Chaplin promised vaguely to do something . At this point comes a series of explanatory subtitles to indicate the passage of a period of five years . Chaplin , casting for his newest picture , " The Gold Rush , " engaged Mrs. Spicer 's gifted little girl ( now known as Lin Grey ) as his leading woman . And so , last November he entrained suddenly for Guyamas , Mexico , and married her . The details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( It was known , however , that Chaplin 's best man , who journeyed madly across the continent to stand by his pal 's side at the joyous happening , was Nathan Burkan , New York theatrical lawyer . ) No previous word of it was permitted to become known and consequently , when the prospective bridegroom set out for Guyamas , he found no more than seven Los Angeles newspapermen in the same car . These reporters watched him closely , but he finally outguessed them : the ceremony was performed at four a. m. the next day , and Mr. and Mrs. Chaplin were on their way home before the local Brouns had arisen . y ATER the reporters besieged the Chaplin residence . a 1 I and were thrown out by the squire  --  just like so many Keystone cops . This understandable , but ill-advised act , constituted an affront to American journalism , as represented by the Los Angeles Times , Examiner , and News , and Chaplin suffered for it . Dark rumors were circulated as to the military nature of his wedding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rapacious roue . These stories were called to the attention of the California Women 's Clubs , whose members , fulfilling their obligation to civilization , proceeded to pass some resolutions . Charlie Chaplin 's pictures were to be boycotted . Chaplin himself was declared leprous and unfit to associate with decent people . Sid Graumann , proprietor of the most important movie parlors in the Los Angeles district , had booked " The Gold Rush " for a long run at his Egyptian Theatre . Representatives of the women 's clubs went straight to Mr. Graumann and told him , in effect , that he would do well to change his mind . Mr. Graumann , staunch old showman that he is , did well , changed his mind , and cancelled the booking . In the meantime , Mrs. Chaplin had installed herself in her new home and was playing hostess to her mother , her father , her grandmother , her grandfather , her uncle , her aunt and several unidentified cousins . Mr. Chaplin had moved out and was living in the Hollywood Athletic Club . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered $250,000 . Mrs. Spicer refused this , explaining that her daughter 's honor was worth $500,000 , if it was worth a nickel . Chaplin balked . Finally the bickering ceased . Chaplin summarily dismissed his wife 's relations from his home  --  and returned to live there himself . There the case rests , and the Chaplins , the Spicers , the California Women 's Clubs , the Los Angeles press and , undoubtedly , Will H. Hays , are waiting anxiously for the arrival of old Dr. Stork  --  and the subsequent burst of publicity . On dit that it will be in May . Chaplin has engaged another actress , Georgia Hale , to play Mrs. Chaplin 's part in " The Gold Rush " ? necessitating the retaking of many scenes and much delay . However , the picture should be ready by June I. From all accounts , it is an extraordinarily good comedy . It will probably make a great many people laugh . It may even make Fatty Arbuckle laugh out loud . THE President of the General Zionist Organization should know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does . It 's in Brownsville . Brownsville , be it known , is not in the best of repute along , say , West End Avenue , being anyhow one generation behind . But it is the cozy generalities of West End Avenue that Dr. Weizman ever and again leaves  --  when he is shy his monthly quota , say  --  for a good , business-like half-hour in Brownsville . Fifty thousand dollars , they do say , is not much below par for thirty Brownsville minutes . But , to be sure , it all comes out of West End Avenue in the end . For the Brownsville contributions to the Zionist cause axe , in large part , tithes of the rentals  --  only the Income Tax officials know how many  --  of West End Avenue apartments that are Brownsville-owned . AMALICIOUS version of the ensuing anecdote has it that Zuloaga owns two portraits by Adolph Lewisohn . This is obviously impossible , so it will have to be taken for granted that Adolph Lewisohn owns two portraits by Zuloaga . What more natural , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dinner , to remark that he owns two wonderful portraits by Zuloaga ? What more natural , then , than for Mr. Zuloaga to ask Lewisohn what those two portraits are ? What more natural , then , than for Mr. Lewisohn to indicate by a somewhat embarrassed demeanor that he does n't know , he having so many portraits by so many painters , and to change the subject as best he could ? Obviously , of course , the story could not be true if it were Mr. Zuloaga who owned two portraits by Lewisohn. z ULOAGA was being shown the Havemeyer collection , which by the way is one of the best in the world . The group came into the room housing the two El Grecos . Of course Zuloaga was impressed ; but some dramatic gesture was necessary . He turned to his hostess with his hands uplifted . " Ahh  --  Ah  --  Mrs. Havemeyer  --  may I just put my hand on it . " As she assented and the Spanish painter who gets $15,000 per portrait dine forms on the right ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Havemeyer was heard to mutter ! " It might do you more good if you put your head on it . " THERE are , alas , those who are only too eager to say thus and thus about Mr. Joseph Stransky as a conductor . Recently , for example , Mr. Stransky 's Summer home was struck by lightning , but Mr Stransky escaped all injury . Flirtations with lightning do not usually result as fortunately . At the Raquet Club a few days later there was some talk of this miraculous escape . " Miraculous , nothing , " said David H. Wallace . " Naturally he would escape . Is he not our leading non-conductor ? " Or , again , some time ago there was a proposal that certain prominent musicians should form an orchestra , of which the outstanding virtue was to be that the celebrities were all to assume the obligations of instruments to which they were unaccustomed . Kreisler , to be sure , would play the piano , Rosenthal the harpsicord and Heifetz the oboe. duct , wndill Strans he not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the calendar it is Spring . The wise are putting away the light garments to which they were foully lured by an impertinent February and are accustoming themselves to the woolen and substantial things that are their March heritage . The hurdygurdys have removed the premature " Wearing of the Green " and " Spring Song " from their repertoires and gone back to the retail coal business . Every post brings tidings from fiends in Munich that the Bock-Bier is better than ever and that the Backfische are scantily arrayed in georgette . Fifth Avenue is covered with fur and the orangeade stands are still glass-enclosed and are still selling hot dogs .
