One day last week , President Paul von Hindenburg stood in a public square in Munich with a large gold ring in his hand . <P> Of course , a large crowd gathered about him . But anyone would have noticed that this was a very unusual crowd indeed . <P> For they were all dressed in colorful Bavarian costumes , and they sang lusty German songs and strewed flowers over the pavement . Many buxom daughters of wine growers came up to Old Paul and offered him sips of Bavarian wine . And the President sipped . <P> Also there was a parade of butchers , millers , coopers and brewers . Standard bearers held aloft their ancient guild emblems and heralds , twinkling in gilded costumes , blew trumpets . <P> So , had it not been for the familiar square head of Old Paul von Hindenburg , an observer would have thought that this was medieval Germany . <P> But it was not medieval Germany . Instead it was the ceremonies attending the laying of a corner stone of the new Germanic Museum at Munich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honor ring of the Museum with which Herr Goldenberger , the Bavarian Minister of Education , presented him . <P> Then spoke Old Paul , serious amidst much jollity : <P> " May this building serve German labor , German reconstruction and the entire future of Germany . May all who strive here be guided by the thought : ' Everything for the Fatherland . ' " <P> Then he struck the corner stone three times with a hammer , and that ended the ceremonies .
