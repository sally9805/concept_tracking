Cox to the people during the national campaign . Governor Cox has made this perfectly clear ' to friends who have dincusseci the subject with him since his nemina lion . The silence of both the Demo , cratic and Republican national platforms on the quekion of prohibition enforcement and the definite and di- ? vergent stand on the League covenont issue in those two documents the Governor regards as ample justification for the course he intends to pursue . . " I : regard ths ' ? Iplatfoym Adopted at San Frinehle6 ' ** note given by the Democratic Party to the American people , " said Governor Cox to TnE TIMEs correspondent today . " 1 will make my fight and shape my Administration , If elected , in full and unreserved recognition of that fact .

" Governor Cox regards the Congressional elections this Fall 11H the proper forum through which to carry to the people the fight for a liberalization of the Volstend net , in line with the traditional Democratic doctrine of sovereign State rights . On Congress , ho holds , would devolve the task of making changes in that law on which many of the supporters of his nomination are so firmly intent . Believes Wilson Approves . The Governor has every reason to believe that the President will be found . in full accord with the views he has expressed on the dominant issue of the campaign .. Before writing his speech of acceptance , in which he intends there shall be the fullest expos : - Ron of his own attitude on the subject . Governor Cox expects to have the benefit of President Wilson 's counsel and co-operation . It was pointed out today flint the President had receded from his original attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Senate " without the dotting of an ' I ' or the crossing of a ' t , ' " and has made it clear to the country that , while utterly opposed to " nullifying " reserve dons , he would accept reservations written in for the solo purpose of clarifying or interpreting the text of the covenant In the light of American laws and institutions for the benefit of the other Wien contracting parties . Governor Cox contends that the reservations proposed by him are merely interpretative , and as such should find favor with President Wilson . He insists that , appearances to the contrary notwithstanding , they do not in any way impair the effectiveness of Article X .. which provides guarantees for . the territorial integrity of nations entering the League against aggression from without , and has been pronounced by the President " the heart of the cove . nant . " Text of Cox . Reservations . Reno is the text of the two reservations proposed by Governor Cox , which stand word for word as they did in his article published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first reservation is : " In giving Its assent to this treaty the Senate has in mind the fact that The League of Nations which It embodies was devised for the sole purpose of maintaining peace and comity among the nations of the earth and preventing a. recurrence of such destructive con ? filet as that through which the world has just passed . ' The co-operation of the United States with the League and its continuance as a. member thereof VIII naturally depend upon the adherence of the League to that fundamental purpose . " The second reads as follows : " It will of course bo understood that to carrying out the purpose of the League the Government of the United States must at tell times net In strict harmony with the terms and intent of the United Staten Constitution , which can not in any way be altered by the i treaty-m.tking power . " Governor Cox raid today that ho would I reserve any further statements on the League of Nations , beyond those he has given , in an interview for The SUNDAY TIMES ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his speech of acceptance and his Campaign utterances . It is expected that before he writes his speech he Will seek from President Wilson indorsement of his proposal for " interpretative " reservations . It is not -. mown as yet when Mr. Cox 's conference with President Wilson Will occur , but it is regarded as unlikely that they will meet prior to the conference here of the Democratic National Committee , which has been fixed for Jury 20 . Governor Cox said today he had not seen President Wilson since the President filled a speaking engagement at Columbus early in his campaign for ratification of the League covenant , Which was cut short by his illness . . found to Heap ' Up Fight . The Governor , both in public speeches and in the two newspapers of which he Is the publisher ; has fought with both vigor and valor in support of the President 's battle for ratification . He Is fully determined to continue that fight during the campaign and to expose and denounce the motive  --  part polities , part vindictiveness  --  which led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! of Pence with the Central Powers . Friends of Governor Cox do not believe Ohio Republicans will be in a position , in furtherance of some general patty campaign policy , to evade the League of Nations issue , or to force prohibition enforcement to the fore in the Gvernor 's own State , which of necessity will be one of the most hotly contested battlegrounds in the campaign , both the Presidential nominees being Ohio men . Both the Republican and Democratic State organizations already have picked pretty nearly all their candidates for nominations for State offices , and many of those selected by the Republicans are known as wets or hold liberal views on the c.:twice. of pro ( ; : ? t IL/ t , while , fan some reason , the contrary is true : n as many instances with regard to the men selected by the Democrats . This , promintnt Democrats here believe , will prevent any attempt to divert the fight in Ohio fsom the lines tentatively laid down by Governor Cox . There are tine !

The others whose prospects are not regarded as promising are Colonel Ralph Cloe of Findlay and exRepresentative Roscoe McCollough , both dry . The Democratic nominee in prospect , State Auditor Victor Donahey , is a pronounced dry . The Democratic candidate for the nom-. ination for United States Senator , W. A. Julian of Cincinnati , is ' a dry , too . There are three Republican Senatorial candidates ? ex-Governor Frank B. Willis , Judge R. M. Wanamaker and Waiter Browne , ea-letal Moose leader in the State . Mr. Browne , who is reported most likely to win hi the primaries , has not declared himself on the wet and dry issue . but is regarded as liberal , if not Wet . The fight in Ohio , which may prove a pivotal State this year , is more likely to be a contest by Governor Cox and those who stand with him along progressive lines against " standpatism " as represented by his Republican opponent . Senator Herding , and the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cos e made for himself with the people of hi a home State , who thrice chose him to be their Chief Executive , would readily lend itself to such a contest .

It is pointed - out that Cox won his first nomination and election to the office he now holas through a fight for a constitutional convention to thoroughly overhaul and revise the organic law of Ohio , which hail hampered and hobbled the officers who sought to.administer the affairs of the State along lines of -progressiveness and modern efficiency . Senator Harding was with the other side in that fight . Then , again , the Governor , after the Constitutional Convention had met and clone its work with some degree of thoroughness , was in the forefront of a fight foe ratification , when again he had to contend against Senator Harding and the Buckeye RePublican machine generally .
