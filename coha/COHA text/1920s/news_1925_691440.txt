txt The governing power of the world has passed from those born to rule under the theory of the divine right of kings to business men and bankers , Chauncey M. Depew declared last evening at a " birthday " dinner in his honor at the Montauk Club , Brooklyn , which club has held a similar dinner annually during the last thirty-four years . Mr. Depew showed little indication of his age in making his address and received an enthusiastic welcome from those'present , most of wiom had attended previous dinners in his honor . About four hundred men and women attended . Taking for his theme the changes that have occurred in the third of a century during which theft dinners for him have been given , Mr. Depew , who was 91 years old on April 23 last , reviewed among other things the passing of the Hohenzollerns , Hapsburgs and Romanoffs . These until the World War ruled the three great empires of Germany , Austria-Hungary and Russia and , he added , held peace or war and the welfare of the whole human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died with the dynasty of the Czar , " Mr. Depew said . " Emperor William is an exile and Germany is a republic . The old Emperor Francis Joseph died of a broken heart and his empire is split up into many separate nationalities . " If wisdom , instead of passion and ambition , had ruled the Conference at Versailles . Prussia would have been left alone by herself ; Bavaria and Saxony would have been united to German Austria , and the fear wh'ch now haunts and almost paralyzes Barone of another war , a war of revenge , . zrould have disappeared forever . There may be other wars , but they will not depend upon the insanity or the indigestion or the ambition of any ruling family or any great ruler . In the cataclysmic changes which have taken place the king business has fallen into desuetude . There is no king at present who has any autocratic power . Even the Turkish Sultan is an exile , and the Turks have now the approximation of a republic . New Ruling Forces . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering magnificence and power which amazed and dazed us when we began these entertainments have disappeared . The world has to be governed or else civilization ceases when chaos comes in . The world is governed , but not by people born to rule , not by people of inherited authority , not by people destined apparently by the Almighty for government , but by the business men and bankers of the world . They are the new ruling forces , and their powers grow day by day . " They may be materialistic in their views , they may lack Idealistic and ethical theories , but at the same time they are for law and order , and for that supreme element of stability and justice , the independence and dignity of the individual , his right to earn and his right to be protected in what he earns , and an infallible belief that with home and independence come the salvation of society . " Austria had gone bankrupt and was on the verge of a collapse which would have depopulated Vienna . The business men and the bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Their representative appeared at that great capital . He had with him the money which was necessary for the reorganization and rescue of the city and its territories ; he had the power to prohibit and the power to enforce . Austria got the money necessary for her salvation , and a miracle was performed . " Ancient Hungary was on the rocks . The business men and bankers came to the same conclusion and went to the rescue . The result is that Hungary has been saved and is entering upon a new career . The business men and bankers have saved Germany . They are helping France . The salvation of Europe depends largely on the acceptance of the Dawes plan and that scheme is the work of the business men and the bankers .

" When heredity or the ordinary process ? of liberty and its development had not united this great middle class for its own protection , Providence has raised a leader equal to the task . This was preeminently the case in Italy where , in the darkest hour of Communiat triumph and chaos in industry and production , Mussolini organized and consolidated the forces of law , order ar ?

" When Darwin first published his startling views on evolution , they were widely discussed and finally generally adopted by the scientific world . In fact , they had not been seriously questioned until William Jennings Bryan from a religious standpoint started an agitation to prevent the Darwinian theories from being taught in schools and colleges . " Now there is a more extensive effort than met- to find the ' missing link ' or - once trace of the origin of the human species .

" The life-long optimism of Mr. Depew was shown in the concluding paragraph of his speech , In which he summed up tale philosophy of his life as follows : " So , my friends , I have come to the conclusion , after a long experience and many large observations with mature judgment , properly based , and properly ' buttressed , that the only sure guides to svecess ar ' character , health and happire ss .
