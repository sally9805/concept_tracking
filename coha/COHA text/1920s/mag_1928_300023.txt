The season of State conventions and primary elections progressed last week to the augury stage . <P> Maine . Though its presidential vote has been chronically Republican since the Civil War , with the exception of the split-year 1912 , there is a certain post-mortem parallelism between Maine 's state-election votes in September and the nation 's presidential votes two months later . There was , accordingly , nationwide Republican whoopee when William Tudor Gardiner , Republican , was elected Governor of Maine by an 82,000 majority over Edward C. Moran , Jr. , Democrat . It was the largest G. O. P. margin in Maine history and was shared generally by the full ticket for Senator and Representatives . <P> The Brown Derby ignored or belittled the occurrence . Arch-Hooverites said : " It 's all over , including the shouting . " <P> Georgia .

Steele and onetime ( 1919-27 ) Representative William ( " Earnest Willie " ) Upshaw , who sought to " come back ' ' with Anathema Smith as his one issue .

Bone of Tacoma for the nomination to Mr. Johnson 's seat . Mr. Johnson won narrowly . Other Republican winners were Governor Roland H. Hartley ( renominated ) and Kenneth Macintosh . The latter outran Miles Poindexter , oldtime ( 1911-23 ) Senator , retired Ambassador to Peru , for nomination to the Senate seat now occupied by Washington 's Clarence C. Dill . Democrats nominated Lawyer A. Scott Bullitt of Seattle to run against Governor Hartley . Senator Dill 's renomination was unopposed . <P> Arizona . Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won his Democratic renomination . Democrat George Wylie Paul Hunt . Arizona 's habitual ( 1911-19 ; 1923-28 ) Governor , was put up for an eighth term . If Arizona goes in November as in September , Senator Ashurst will be re-elected by three-to-one over Republican Nominee Ralph H. Cameron . Governor Hunt 's opponent will be Judge John C. Phillips . <P> Colorado . The biggest question in Colorado was whether or not Denver 's Democrats were as Wet as when , last year , they sent S. Harrison White to the House . They were .
