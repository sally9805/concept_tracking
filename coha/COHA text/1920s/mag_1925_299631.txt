Human potentiality is a variable which constantly approaches a limit it can never reach . Nothing is so likely as the impossible , for which reason people do well to give more credence to their prophets than to their logicians . What can be done and what can not be done seems , after the expeditions of many years , to be fairly determined ; but no sooner is it so than someone is born who borrows a caravel from his Queen and pays her back with a continent , throws an army over the Alps , or outstrips Time with the fleetness of his heels . <P> Mile . Last week , on the indoor track of Madison Square Garden , Manhattan , Paavo Nurmi of Finland made his first appearance in the U. S. His first event was a mile race . Nurmi , a thin , blond man , wore a jersey of robin 's egg blue , trunks of black . In his right hand , he carried the little watch by which he timed his stride . He disdained , at the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and Hahn ( Boston A. A. ) both got away from the pistol before him . Through the first lap , while his competitors jostled for position , Nurmi kept in the rear ; when the others had settled into a file , he jogged into the lead . Higgins , onetime Columbia University star , passed him at the 600-yard post ; Nurmi paid no attention . He ran very erect , pulled his legs up in front of him like levers operated by a machine , as efficient as an airplane motor . Ray was now running third ; three and a half laps from the finish , he jumped the field , passed Nurmi , Higgins , opened up a lead of ten yards . The crowd roared . Nurmi plodded on . One lap , two laps . His levers began to pump a little faster . Ray was tired . Suddenly Ray , suddenly Hahn , heard a great roar that was not for them . The robin's-egg shirt had begun to move . Hahn , Ray , saw it go past them , round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the tape , Nurmi looked over his shoulder . He saw Ray , swaying , agonized , fighting to take second place from Hahn . He slowed down , stepped through the tape at a walk . His time- 4:13 3/5-broke by a second Ray 's world record for the indoor* mile . <P> An hour intervened before the next race . Nurmi , when he had rubbed and showered , strolled among the trainers , timers and rubbers . Blandly , in disregard of their amazed murmurs , he ate a large red apple . <P> 5,000 Metres . The track in Madison Square Garden has eleven laps to the mile ( approximately 34 laps to the 5,000 metres ) . Willie Ritola , brother Finn , old rival of Nurmi , took the lead . At his heels came the flying robin's-egg jersey . Lap after lap the two circled , the field after them . Two laps from home Nurmi sprinted , left a gap of 5 yards , widened it to 10 , to 15 . Gamely Ritola hung on , his face twisted like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to look . Running like a sprinter who , throughout an afternoon 's field sport , has traveled no more than 100 yards , Nurmi broke the tape , broke also , by 9 2/5 seconds , a world 's record . ( Time , 14:44 3/5 ) .
