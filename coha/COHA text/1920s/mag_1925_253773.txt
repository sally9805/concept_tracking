The past week in Rome was , as in other parts of the world , seven days long , but to Italians it must have seemed like seven ages . <P> <P> In the midst of a perfect pandemonium of insults , assaults , challenges , blows , accusations , threats and other manifestations of a risen anger , Benito Mussolini , Premier of Italy , held his ground . <P> To a group of Fascist editors he said : <P> " This is the first of a series of meetings which will show the indestructible power of Fascism . It is grotesque to judge a battle or a war by the first maneuvre . After having won as regards the length of front , we must now win in depth . And we will win , that is final . My presentation of the electoral bill , medidated upon for a long time , is the beginning , not the end , and it offers the party an opportunity of winning a great political battle-a political , not only an electoral battle , I ask you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uproarious cheers of his followers , it left the Opposition press , long since inured to his bombastic rhetoric , stone cold . Such remarks as the following were the order of the day : " Italy can not continue to be governed by a man who is four centuries behind , as Mussolini can only be compared to a lord of the 16th Century . " <P> " Italy can not be governed by a man who is implicated in a criminal trial . " <P> Among the politicians of the Opposition , criticism was warped by anger . The Cesare Rossi memorandum-an indictment of Mussolini for having pre-sonally incited violence , by a Fascist under arrest in connection with the Matteotti murder-was frequently invoked and similar accusations were threatened . <P> It was clear that the Government was sick to death of the Opposition 's attacks , that the Opposition was weary of the Government 's talk without action , that the Italian people were fed to the teeth with both the Government and the Opposition . The Government decided on action . A rumor had reached it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers were seized in Rome , Milan , Turin ; many homes of prominent Opposition leaders were searched . <P> There followed savage attacks by Communists upon Fascisti all over the country . In 48 hours , 17 people were hurt , 5 mortally wounded , 3 killed . Premier Mussolini appealed for order . <P> Opposition newspapers carried a fake story that a force of 60,000 Fascisti was marching on Rome to inaugurate a reign of terror . Eight newspapers in Rome , five in Milan , one in Turin , two in Genoa , five in Naples , two in Verona-23 in all-were seized , but were permitted to publish again after the offending story had been deleted . <P> The blazing fires of Mussolini 's wrath were kindled . At the reopening of the Chamber of Deputies , the Premier appeared as a man possessed with the devil . The Government benches resounded with the thumps from his large , white hands . His heavy face was red with fury , his eyes flashed like a thousand daggers in the sunlight , his voice sounded like the bellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roared :
