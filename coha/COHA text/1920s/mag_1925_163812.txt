Down a country road near Great Missenden sped two roaring motors last week . In the car ahead sat Premier Baldwin , his wife and daughter . The dignity of his office prevented British journals from subsequently describing the situation as a race . <P> Suddenly the road turned , but not the Baldwin motor-it skidded . In a flash between split seconds several near-tragedies became comic . The Baldwin car knocked a farmer 's cart , complete with horse and farmer , into the ditch . A car which thundered behind , anonymously piloted , skidded likewise but slued by , missing the assorted debris by inches . As ever , Mr. Baldwin rose to the occasion , imperturbable , good-natured . First he made sure that none of the human beings concerned had been hurt . Then he assisted in quieting the slightly bruised and badly frightened horse ; helped to get both horse and cart out of the ditch . Finally he climbed back into his damaged car , which was coaxed by the chauffeur at a walking pace to Amershal . There the Baldwins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes behind their original schedule . <P> *The list of signatories in full : Stanley Baldwin , Winston Churchill , Sir William Joynson-Hicks , Lord Birkenhead and C.
