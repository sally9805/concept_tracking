txt DRY LAW AND TREATIES . Arrangement . for Liquor on Ships Held to Defy Supreme Court Ruling . To the Editor of The New York Times : On April 30 , 1920 , the United States Supreme Court handed down a decision in the Cunard steamship case that the Eighteenth Amendment and the National Prohibition act apply to all merchant vessels , both domestic and foreign , when within the territorial waters of the United States , except while in transit through the Canal Zone , and they do not apply to domestic vessels when beyond these waters . Since then treaties have been made with foreign powers giving them the right to bring into the territorial waters of this country alcoholic liquors under seal . " The President shall have power , by and with the consent of the Senate , to make treaties , provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur . " The President is unquestionably responsible for all treaties . This is a clear case of the treatymaking power of the country defying a decision of the United States Supreme Court and nullifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrogate or render inoperative the whole Constitution of the United States , or any part thereof , for the benefit of foreign powers is , presumably , " statesmanship " from the Republican standpoint . To define more clearly ' and sanely " an intoxicating liquor , " to substitute for the present enforcement fiasco a common-sense , tried and proved plan of liquor control , to give back to the people of these United States their right to trial by jury and their constitutional guarantees of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness  --  to do all these things , as proposed by Governor Smith in his acceptance at Albany , is , from this same , strange Republican standpoint , " nullification . " The President of the United States is bound by the Constitution and . his oath to enforce the law . Has he done it ? The language of the aforementioned decision of the Supreme Court is clear and unmistakable . Instead of the President seeking to have the law enforced , that this decision defined , he had it nullified by a treaty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nullifications and direct violations , chief among which are the violations of Sections 3 and 6 of the Interstate Commerce act and Section 28 of the Merchant Marine act of 1920 .

Humanitarian , Not Punitive . To the Editor of The New York Times : It gives me great pleasure to bring to your attention the following message that I nave just received from our Foreign Office in Honduras in regard to certain information that has been published in your daily : " THE NEW Yong MIES gives out the news that American Marines have entered Honduran territory with the object of taking back Nicaraguan refugees . Said news is untrue . The Government of Honduras gave permission to a joint Nicaraguan-American commission , bringing funds , to enter territory and repatriate needy Nicaraguans . Considering humanitarian aim , our Government readily gave permission without the least affront to our territory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , Aug. 30 , 1028 . As to Blasphemy . ? To the Editor o ' The New York Times : The queer charge of blasphemy brought against Dr. Horace Meyer Kallen recalls an incident of anti-slavery days . Dr Cox . a prominent New York clergyman , preached an anti-slavery sermon . In the course of it he said that Jesus was not a member of the Caucasian race . At once a report went abroad that Dr. Cox had said " Jesus Christ was a nigger . " The mob rose . I think they burned his house . At all events . be was in so much uersonal danger that he took refuge at my grandfather 's home on Long Island till it was safe for him to go back to the city . vvrath against political or economic heresy often masquerades as piety . ALICE STONE 13LACKWELL . Chilmark . Mass , Aug. 30 , 1028 , FINANCING THE BRIDGE . Triborough Structure 's Cost Should Be Borne by Public Moneys . To the Editor of The New York Times : A formal proposal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astoria , Queens , the upper part of Manhattan and the southerly end of the Bronx , was submitted to the Board of Estimate by a committee of the Long Island Chamber of Commerce . It would perhaps be more in keeping with the present needs of vehicular traffic to build a tunnel under the river connecting the aforementioned boroughs . In support of this contention I quote from an interview published in THE NEW YORK TIMES of Aug. 21 , with Ole Singstad , the great engineer who completed the Holland Tunnel . He said he favored tunnels " because they relieve congestion in our city streets , whereas bridges create it , and also from a sense of economy . " Private capital should not , however , be permitted to finance bridges or tunnels any . more than it should be allowed to build other public highways and charge toll . This is clearly a function of the State . The claim that the city has not sufficient credit to permit it to build a proposed bridge , and at the same time provide all other necessary public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the recent constitutional amendment exempting $300,000,000 worth of subway bonds from the computation of the debt limit , the city 's credit will be sufficient to build the proposed bridge or tunnel , since it will only be necessary to appropriate each year enough funds for the current year 's construction . However , Controller Berry will be in a better position to tell how the city 's finances stand in this respect when the time comes to decide . But even if the city 's credit should be sufficient to build the proposed bridge , account should be taken of the tremendously growing vehicular traffic . Adequate financial provision should be made for all time to come to meet the city 's growing need for bridges and tunnels . In an editorial in THE NEW YORK TIMES of Aug. 21 , under the caption " Bridge Finances , " among other things it stated : " If tolls are to be charged at all on such enterprises , it were better that they should go into the public treasury , as Governor Smith recommended . " In vetoing several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be built by private capital and which were passed by the last Legislature , Governor Smith said that he " regretted that the Bear Mountain Bridge was built with private capital . " Under the present laws limiting the city 's credit , adequate financial provision could ' not be provided for the growing needs of vehicular traffic . Obviously some other method of obtaining revenue must be provided . No better method of providing capital for this purpose can be devised than . that by which we build our docks and wonderful water supply systems in New York City , and recently the subways , namely , by exempting from the computation of the debt limit self-supporting bridge and tunnel bonds . By this method a sufficient number of bridges and tunnels can be built to meet the growing demands without impairing our credit , just as we now build docks and ' extend our water system , regardless of our debt margin . These tunnels and bridges erected by finances secured by issuing self-supporting bonds should be so placed as not to compete with each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased population and city visitors , require it , other bridges and tunnels can be provided without im'pairing the earning power of those already erected and without waiting for private capital to step in and build them . It would cure the situation if Governor Smith 's aid was secured to help pass an amendment to the Constitution exempting bridge and tunnel bonds from the computation of the debt limit , as it was in passing the subway bond amendment , which exempted from the computation of the debt limit $300,00,000 worth of subway bonds . EDWARD POLAK . New York , Aug. 27 , 1928 . Great Journalistic Feat . From The Mobile ( Ala . ) Register . Regarded simply as a mechanical performance , the Tins NEW ' YORK TIMES 'S report of the ' subway disaster of last Friday had all the qualities of greatness . The wreck took place at 5 o'clock , and from the nature of the conditions there ensued much confusion and delay in respect to learning what had happened ; yet in the few hours intervening to press time there was prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wreck itself : with list of the dead and the injured ; the police and firemen 's rescue work ; the hospital service : tile effect upon city traffic : the Interviews with the survivors ; interviews with officials ; and the starting by the Mayor of an investigation into the cause and responsibility for the accident ? some twenty columns of type , equal to a volume , if printed in book form . It is not known how much time the preparation of these many feature reports required . but , manifestly , tile work was done In little time and at full speed , yet as well done as if all tho time in the world had been at command . Then it was printed , and before daylight began 500.000 conies were flying abroad . carrying the news of the greatest calamity of the sort that had ever afflicted the metropolis . Prom every point of view it was a remarkable feat  --  only possible in our own day of modern machinery and skillfully directed organization . Unbidden Voters .
