<P> In Manhattan last week 400 young women made a polite but determined entrance into a room on the 22nd floor of the Hotel Barbizon . They were dressed in their anxious best . They were members of the Junior League of America and they were visiting their new national headquarters . <P> The room they saw modernistically designed by Junior Leaguer Mrs. George Draper is bright , undeniably attractive . Rubber plants and Venetian blinds somehow suggest Bermuda , California . There are white-washed walls , blue carpets , orange velvet chairs . From the windows the Junior Leaguers gazed rhapsodically on Manhattan 's skyscrapers . <P> On the 21st floor of the hotel are the offices of the League 's only national publication , the Junior League Magazine . For the first time in its history the Junior League now has its national headquarters lodged in its own offices . Heretofore confusingly the headquarters were in the same building as the subsidiary Junior League of New York City . <P> The League consists of 20,000 young women of the U. S. allied by social security and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also Junior Leagues in Canada , Honolulu . Recently colleens in Ireland have shown interest , written letters , spoken of forming yet another Junior League .
