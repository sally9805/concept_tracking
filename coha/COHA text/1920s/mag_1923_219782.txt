James A. Farrell , president of the United States Steel Corporation , speaking in New Orleans , advocated sale to foreign lines of U. S. Shipping Board vessels which could not be sold to Americans . <P> He said that two-thirds of the Government fleet could be put into commission at a maximum cost of $5 a ton , deadweight , and at least half of it ultimately sold to foreign buyers at $10 a ton less than they can now build similar vessels . <P> Loss in operation , said Mr. Farrell , is due not to surplus ships , but to lack of cooperation between foreign and domestic lines .
