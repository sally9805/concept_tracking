At Bunzlau , Silesian railroad town on the Sober River , one Eduard Kemp haled his neighbors around his piano . Playing the piano was his forte and he was going to play it for a long , long time . For hours he played . Neighbors gaped , yawned , went home to sensible featherbeds . Next day they found him playing erratically , and the next day more erratically . After 82 hours he ceased . Crazily he challenged the world for his peculiar competition .
