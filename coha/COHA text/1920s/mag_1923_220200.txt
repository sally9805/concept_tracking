W. Bourke Cockran , Tammany Congressman , made his last speech in the House of Representatives on his birthday , Feb. 28 , and died early the next morning . <P> Old men , wandering among their reminiscences , recalled that rainy night , 33 years ago , in the old convention building on the Chicago lakefront , when Cockran , on a stage over which rain trickled from the leaky roof , faced a howling gallery full of impatient supporters of Grover Cleveland for the Democratic presidential nomination-and nominated the hated David B. Hill . <P> Fearless , magnificent , king of orators , his public career lasted for 40 stormy years . In 1896 he fought Bryan . In 1900 he stumped for Bryan . He quarreled numberless times with Tammany leaders , over whom he towered majestically .
