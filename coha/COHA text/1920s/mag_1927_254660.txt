While economists with harsh voices declaimed last season against and for installment purchase of merchandise , Lawyer Morgan Joseph O'Brien of Manhattan , 74 , father of smart Kenneth O'Brien* and eight other children , studied the selling credits of 34 industries and found them good risk . The result is the $31,000,000 American Rediscount Corn. , which was to start business in Manhattan last week , after the method of the Federal Reserve banks . Lawyer O'Brien is chairman of the company 's advisory committee ; Comptroller Lawrence H. Hendricks of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is the president . <P> The plan of financing is this : <P> A man buys an automobile , or a baby carriage , on the installment plan . He gives his note ( mortgage ) , bearing good interest , to the retail dealer . The dealer sells the customer 's note to a credit finance organization for less than its full value , that is , at a discount . This organization in turn may want ready money for fresh purchases of mortgages . If such concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rediscount Corp. , it will be able to get the cash readily . This is just what the Federal Reserve banks do for ordinary commercial paper . But the American Rediscount Corp . will be able to go further . A private corporation , it can make transactions that the Federal Reserve banks would not or could not touch . <P> Rediscount thus becomes facile , and just because of this facility the new company can enforce strict credit terms if it so pleases . Already it has set a gauge for the time-buying of motor cars . One-third of the retail price must be deposited at the time of purchase , the rest to be paid within twelve months . No money may be loaned on cars more than 2% years old , and only 1/3 of the retail price of the model when new . <P> <P> *Looming young Manhattan lawyer and leader in the National Democratic Club , he married one of the daughters of Clarence H. Mackay . Irving Berlin , songster , married the other .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
