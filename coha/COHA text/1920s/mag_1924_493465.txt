IFreely Zdaptedfrom the Tibetan ) OU must learn to distinguish among at least three kinds of love ( though there are seven in all ) : instinctive love , emotional love and conscious love . There is not much fear that you can not learn the first two , but the third is rare and depends upon effort as well as intelligence . - tive love has chemistry as its base . All biology is - chemistry , or perhaps we should say alchemistry ; and the affinities of instinctive love , manifesting in the attractions , repulsions , mechanical and chemical combinations we call love , courtship , marriage , children and family , are only the human equivalents of a Chemist 's laboratory . But who is the chemist ' here ? We call It Nature . But who is Nature ? As little do we suspect as-the camphor which is married to the banyan suspects a gardener . Yet there is a gardener . Instinctive love , being chemical , is as strong and lasts as long as the substances and qualities of which it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and measured only by one who understands the alcheMical progression we call heredity . Many have remarked that happy or unhappy marriages are hereditary . So too are the number of children , their sex , longevity , etc . The so-called science of astrology is only the science ( when it is ) of heredity over long periods . Emotional love is not rooted in biology . It is , in fact , as often anti-biological in its character and ' direction . Instinctive love obeys the laws of biology , that is to say , chemistry , and proceeds by affinities . But emotional love is often the mutual attraction of dis-affinities and biological incongruities . Emotional love , when not accompanied by instinctive love , ( as It seldom is ) rarely results in offspring ; and when it does , biology is not served . Strange creatures arise from the embraces of emotional love , mermen and mermaids , Bluebeards and des belles - - dames sans merci . Emotional love is not only short-lived , but it evokes its slayer . Such love creates hate in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional lover soon becomes an object of indifference and quickly thereafter of hatred . These are the tragedies of love emotional . Conscious love rarely obtains between humans ; 131.3t it can be illustrated in the relations of man to his favorites in the animal and vegetable kingdoms . The development of the horse and the dog from their original state of nature ; the cultivation of flowers and fruit ? these are examples of a primitive form of conscious love , primitive because the motive is still egoistic and utilitarian . In short , Man has a personal use for the domesticated horse and the cultivated fruit ; and his labor upon them can not be said to be for love alone . The conscious hove motive , in its developed state , is the wish thatthe object should arrive at its own native perfections , regardless of the consequences to the lover . " So she become perfectly herself , what matter I ? " say the conscious lover , " I will go to hell if only she may go to heaven . " And the paradox of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude in its object . Conscious love begets conscious love . It is rare among humans because , in the first place , the vast majority are children who look to be loved but not to love ; secondly , because perfection is seldom conceived as the proper end of human love ? though it alone distinguishes adult human from infantile and animal love ; thirdly , because humans do not know , even if they wish , what is good for those they love ; and fourthly , because it never occurs by chance , but must be the subject of resolve , effort , self-conscious choice . As little as Bushido or the Order of Chivalry grew up accidently does conscious love arise by nature . As these were works of art so must conscious love be a work of art . Such a lover enrolls himself , goes through his apprenticeship , and perhaps one day attains to mastery . He perfects himself in order that he may purely wish and aid the perfection of his beloved . Would one enroll in this service of conscious love ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his beloved . What manner of woman ( or man ) is she ( or he ) ? A-mystery is here : a scent of perfection the nascent air of which is adorable . How may this perfection be actualized ? to the glory of the beloved and of God her Creator ? Let him think , is he fit ? He can only conclude that he is not . Who can not cultivate flowers , or properly treat dogs and horses , how shall he learn to reveal the perfection still seedling in the beloved ? Humility is necessary , and then deliberate tolerance . If I am not sure what is proper to her perfection , let her at least have free way to follow her own bent . Meanwhile to study ? what she is , and may become ; what she needs , what her soul craves and can not find a name , still less , a thing for . To anticipate , today her needs of tomorrow . And without a thought all the while of what her needs may mean to me . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-education are demanded here . Enter these enchanted woods , ye who dare . The gods love each other consciously . Conscious lovers become gods . Without shame people will boast that they have loved , do love or hope to love . As if love were enough , or could cover any multitude of sins . But love , as we have seen , when it is not conscious love ? that is to say , love that aims to be both wise and , able in the service of its object ? is either an affinity or a dis-ailinity , and in both cases equally unconscious , that is , uncontrolled . To be in such a state of love is to be dangerous either to oneself or to the other or to both . ' We are then polarized to a natural force ( which has its own objects to serve regardless of ours ) and charged with its force ; and events are fortunate if we do not damage somebody in consequence of carrying dynamite carelessly . Love without knowledge and power is demoniac . Without knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a beloved made wretched and ill by her or his " lover ? " Without power the lover must become wretched , since he can not do for his beloved what he wisheS and knows to be for her delight . Men should pray to be spared the experience of love without wisdom and strength . Or , finding themselves in love , they should pray for knowledge and power to guide their love . Love is not enough . " I love you , " said the man . " Strange that I feel none the better for it , " said the woman . The truth about love is shown in the order in which religion has been introduced into the world . First came the religion of Power , then came the religion of Knowledge , and last came the religion of Love . Why this order ? Because Love without the former qualities is dangerous . But this is not to say that the succession has been anything more than discretion : since Power alone , like Knowledge alone , is only less dangerous than Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The order is only evidence that since succession was imperative ( man being subject to Time which is succession ) , it was better to begin with the less dangerous dictators and leave Love to the last . A certain prudent man , when he felt himself to be in love , hung a little bell round his neck to caution women that he was dangerous . Unfortunately for themselves they took too much notice of it ; and he suffered accordingly . Until you have wisdom and power equal to your love , be ashamed , my sons and daughters , to avow that you are in love . Or , since you can not conceal it , love humbly and study to be wise and strong . Aim to he worthy to be in love . All true lovers are invulnerable to everybody but their beloved . This comes about not by wish or effort but by the fact of true , ie. , whole , love alone . Temptation has not to be overcome ; it is not experienced . The invulnerability is magical . Moreover , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfaithfulness " is manifested , the conclusion is drawn that invulnerability does not exist . But " infidelity " is not necessarily due to temptation , but possibly and often to indifference ; and there is no Fall where there is no Temptation . Men should learn to discriminate in themselves and in women real and assumed invulnerability . The latter , however eloquent , is due to fear . Only the former is the fruit of love . A certain prudent man , desiring , as all men and women do in their hearts , invulnerability in himself and in the woman he loved , set about it in the following way . He tasted of many women and urged his beloved to taste of many men . After a few years he was satisfied that nothing now could tempt him . She , on the other hand , had had no doubt of herself from the beginning . She had been born invulnerable ; he had attained it . The state of being in love is not always ' defined in relation to one object . One person has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( that is , of polarizing him or her with the natural energy of love ) ; but he or she may not be then either the sole beloved or , indeed , the beloved at all . There are , among people as among chemical substances , agents of catalysis which make possible interchanges and combinations into which the catalysts themselves do not enter . Frequently they are unrecognized by the parties affected , and usually by themselves as well . In the village of Bor-na , not far from Lhassa , there once lived a man who was such a catalyst . People who spoke with him instantly fell in love , but not with him or , indeed , immediately with anybody in particular . All that they were aware of was that they had , after conversation with him , an active spirit of love which was ready to pour itself out in loving service . The European troubadours were perhaps such people . There is no necessary relation between love and children ; but there is a necessary relation between love and creation . Love is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then for procreation ; and if even that is not possible , then for creations of which , perhaps fortunately , we are unconscious . Take it , however , as the fundamental truth about Love : that it always creates . Love created the world ; and not all its works are beautiful ! The procreation of children is the particular function of instinctive love : that is its plane . But above and below this plane , other kinds of love have other ' functions . Emotional love is usually instinctive love out of place ; and its procreations are in consequence misfits in the world . The higher forms of love , on the other hand , either exclude procreation not artificially but naturally or include it only as a byproduct . Neither the purpose nor the function of . conscious love is children ; unless we take the word in the mystic sense of becoming as little children . For briefly , the aim of conscious love is to bring about re-birth , or spiritual childhood . Everybody with perceptions beyond those of male and female must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or woman , however old in years , who loves . It is usually instinctive ; yet it symbolizes the still more marvelous change occurring when a man of woman loves consciously or is aware of being cons sciously loved . The youth in such cases has all the air of eternity : and it is , indeed , the divine youth . The creation of such a spiritual child in each of the two lovers is the peculiar function of conscious love ; and it depends neither upon marriage nor upon children . There are other creations proper to still higher degrees of love ; but they must remain untold until we have become as little children . We are not one but three in one ; and the fact is represented in our physiological make-up . The three main systems , cerebral , nervous and instinctive , exist side by side , sometimes appearing to co-operate , but more often failing , and usually at cross-purposes . In relation to the external world it depends upon the system in charge of the organism at the moment what the response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system is on duty -.  - -  that is , temporarily in charge of the organism -- the response will be one . If the nervous or instinctive system is alone awake , the replies will be different : Three quite different people , each with his own ideas of how his organism should act , exist in us at once : and usually they refuse to co-operate with each other , and , in fact , get in each other 's way . Now imagine such an organism , tenanted by three squabbling persons , to " fall in love . " What has fallen in love ; or , rather , which of the three ? It seldom happens that all three are in love at the same time or with the same object . One is in love , the others are not ; and either they resist or when the lover is off guard make his organism unfaithful ( driving the poor lover to lies and deceit or self-reproach ) ; or they are forced into submission , battered into acquiescence . In such circumstances , ' which every candid reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are continent because you have refrained from sex-relations ; but continence is of the senses as well as of the organs , and of the eyes chiefly . From each of the senses there streams energy ? energy as various as the man himself . It Is not only possible but it is certain that we can ex-Pend ourselves intellectually , emotionally or sex-wally through any one of the senses . To look with lust is much more than simply to look : it is to expend one of the finer substances of which complete *sex-energy is composed ; something passes in the act of vision which is irrecoverable ; and for the want of it the subsequent sex-life is incomplete . It . is the same with the other senses , though less easily realized . In short , it is possible to become cornPletely impotent by means of the senses alone ? yes , by the eyes alone ? while remaining continent in the ordinary meaning . of the word . The chastity of the senses is natural in a few people ; but by the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common . Under the greatest civilization human history has yet known , the capital of which was the city whose poor remains are Bagdad , the chastity of the senses was taught from early child , . hood . Each sense was carefully trained ; and exercises were devised to enable pupils to discriminate the different emanations arriving from sense per . ceptions intellectually , emotionally , instinctively or erotically motived . From this education people acquired the power of directing their senses , with the result that chastity was at least possible , since it was under control . Eroticism thereby became an art , in the highest form the world has seen . Its faint echoes are to be found in Persian and Sufi literature today . Bluebeard and La Belle Dame are the male and female types respectively of the same psychology ? inspirers of hopeless because unrequitable passion . The decapitated ladies who hung round Bluebeard ' . chamber were really about his neck ; and they had only to let go to be free . Similarly the pale warriors and princes in the cave of La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction can be called choice . The legends present Bluebeard and La Belle Dame from the point of view of their ' escaped victims , that is to say , as monsters delighting in erotic sacrifice . But both were as much victims as their titular victims ; and both suffered as much if not more . In such cases of uncontrolled attraction , power passes through the medium who thus becomes formidably magnetic ; and men and women in sympathetic relation are drawn towards him or her like filings towards a magnet . At first , no doubt , the experiences of a Bluebeard or La Belle Dame are pleasant and fortifying to self-pride and self-vanity . The other sex is at their feet . But when , having realized that the power is neither their own nor under their control , they discover that they too are victims , the early satisfaction is dearly paid for . The cure for all parties is difficult . It consists in the reeducation of the body and the senses . Love without divination is elementary . To be in love demands that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before they have come into the beloved 's own consciousness . He knows her better than she knows herself ; and loves her more than . she loves herself ; so that she becomes her perfect self without her own conscious effort . Her conscious effort , when the love is mutual , is for him . Thus each delightfully works perfection in the other . But this state is not ordinarily attained in nature ; it is the fruit of art , of self-training . All people desire it , even the most cynical ; but since it seldom occurs by chance , and nobody has published the key to its creation , the vast majority doubt even its possibility . Nevertheless it is possible , provided that the parties can learn and teach humbly . Flow to begin ? Let the lover when he is about to see his beloved think what he should take , do , or say so as to give her a delightful surprise . At first it will necessarily be a surprise that is not a complete surprise ; that is to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only delighted that her lover had guessed it . Later the delightful surprise may really surprise her. ; and her remark will be : " How did you know I should be pleased , since I should never have guessed it myself ? " Constant efforts to anticipate the nascent wishes of the beloved while they are still unconscious needs are the means to conscious love . Take hold tightly ; let go lightly . This is one of the great secrets of felicity in love . For every Romeo and Juliet tragedy arising from the external cirumstances of the two parties , a thousand tragedies arise from the circumstances created by the lovers themselves . As they seldom know the moment or the way to " take hold " of each other , so they even more rarely know the way or the moment to " let go . " The ravines of Mount Never ( i.e. , Venusberg ) are filled with lovers who can not leave each other . Each wishes to let go , but the other will not permit it . There are various explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approach has been wrong : that is to say , the parties have leapt into union without thought of the way out . Often the first five minutes of the lovers ' first meeting are decisive of the whole future of the relations . In some instances the original relation has been responsible for the subsequent difficulty of " letting go " ; it should never have been ; or not have been in the precise circumstances of its occurrence . Mistimed relations always cause trouble . In other cases the difficulty is due to difference in age , education or " past . " One is afraid to " let go " because it appears to be the last hope or because too much time has already been spent on it , or because it has been the best up to date , or because his " ideal , " created by education , demands eternal fidelity even where it is not possible because it is not desired by both ; or because one is oversensitive from past experience and can not face another failure or because the flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither party can use a knife ; or because circumstances are unfavorable , i. e. , the parties must continue to see each other ; or because of imagination , as when one or the other pictures the happiness of the other without him or her . There are a thousand explanations , and every one of them , while sufficient as cause is quite inadequate as reason , the fact being that when one of the parties desires to separate the other 's love-duty is to " let go . " Great love can both let go and take hold . Jealousy is the dragon in paradise ; the hell of heaven ; and the most bitter of the emotions because associated with the sweetest . There is a specific against jealousy , namely , conscious love : but this remedy is harder to find than the disease is to endure . But there are palliatives of which the first therapeutic condition is the recognition of the disease and the second the wish to cure oneself . in these circumstances let the sufferer deliberately experiment . Much may be forgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , try to forward the new plans of his former beloved ? but this is difficult without obvious hypocrisy . Or he may plunge into new society . Or he may engage ban-self in a new work that demands all his energy . Or he may cast a spell on his memory and regard hisformer beloved as dead ; or as having become his sister ; or as having gone away on a long journey ; or as having become enchanted . Best , however , if he " let go " ' completely with no lingering hope of ever meeting her again . Be comforted . Our life is but one day of our Life . If not today , tomorrow ! Let go !
