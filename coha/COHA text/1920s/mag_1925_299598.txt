Her Night of Romance . Constance Talmadge does not perform very often . It is just and eminently fitting that when she does she selects a good sustaining menu of amusement . Such a menu is the present film . It is all light food , thin and made for laughter . Arriving in England is an American heiress to $10,000,000 . Starving in England at the same time is Lord Menford . To frighten off the wolf , Lord Menford sells to this heiress his estate , " catches a bun " the next night and is delivered to his ancient gates . Thereupon they are marooned together for two nights and a day . Woven through this inconsequential thesis is a variety of vigorous by-play and device . Miss Talmadge is excellent as usual and is aided immensely in her pantomime by the brilliant support supplied by Ronald Colman . Director Sidney Franklin has done a neatly knit and thoroughly ingenious job . <P> If I marry Again sounds like one of those pulpy domestic morals with which the jaded directors are so fond of fabling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a domestic warning to males . Confide in your wife , it counsels . Tell her all your troubles and your problems . Tell her a joke now and then . All this is demonstrated through the medium of a cabaret girl who married an earnest youth and got on amiably with him despite her inconspicuous beginnings . Another , more propitious , marriage in the picture crumbled because the principals were partners but not companions . Doris Kenyon helps matters along with a serviceable emotional performance . <P> Locked Doors . Youth ( Betty Compson ) married to simple senility ( Theodore Roberts ) falls in love with a young and handsome hero ( Theodor von Eltiz ) . This happens by the side of a trout stream in romantic circumstances that just escape being obvious . From the viewpoint of technique the story gets worse and worse . A red-hot flatiron sets fire to the house at midnight , and , as if this were not ridiculous enough , the young lovers , saying protracted good-byes in the lady 's bedroom , persist in arguing as the flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the marriage of the perfectly mated .
