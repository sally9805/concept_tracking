Silver spade cut lightly into Pittsburgh soil , scooped up a scant quart of mineral-laden earth . Ground had been broken for the $10,000,000 power plant of the Duquesne Light Co. on Brunot 's Island in the Ohio River. * Celebrities and guests boarded the steamship Manitou , chatted away the half-hour trip from the Island back to the city proper . In the earth , the cut remained . <P> Shallow the cut in the earth ; deep the cut in Pittsburgh history . For as the silver spade , dirtied , was carried away , one or another of the watchers recalled these names : <P> Andrew Carnegie <P> Philander C. Knox <P> Andrew W. Mellon <P> John Pierpont Morgan <P> David Reed <P> James Hay Reed <P> David A. Reed <P> Every watcher knew that the great power plant will not be called conventionally , " Unit 27 " or " Brunot 's Island Plant . " but will bear the name of James Hay Reed . Most watchers , city-conscious , remembered smart James Hay Reed as the Pittsburgh lawyer behind the formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his law in two good schools . As a graduate of the Western University of Pennsylvania ( now University of Pittsburgh ) , he had gone first to the office of his lawyer uncle , famed David Reed of Pittsburgh . Five years of study and he was ready , in 1877 , to form a partnership with Philander C. Knox , later U. S. Senator , later Secretary of State . <P> Andrew Carnegie liked him , admired him . Lawyer Reed became president of the Bessemer &; Lake Erie R. R. , chairman of the board of Carnegie Steel Co . And when Carnegie dickered with the late , great J. P. Morgan to sink Carnegie Steel into the new U. S. Steel , it was Lawyer Reed who drew the mortgages which secured the bonds . Active to his death , in May 1927 , Lawyer Reed saw Pittsburgh steel , Pittsburgh public utilities , grow into mighty units of U. S. industry . <P> It was fitting , therefore , that when Duquesne Light planned its new development , the company should honor a former official , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the invitation to Lawyer Reed 's son to speak at the dedication . Smart son of a smart father , and smart namesake of a smart granduncle , David A. Reed , 47 , has many a distinction . He is a close friend of Andrew W. Mellon . He is , at the moment , both senior and junior U. S. Senator from Pennsylvania , because Philadelphia 's Vare has not yet been admitted to the U. S. Senate . <P> *Ten miles northwest of " The Point , " where the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers meet to form the mighty Ohio , and where Fort Duquesne ( 1754 ) , became the nub of Pittsburgh , Brunot 's Island is now within the city limits . Pittsburgh 's harbor , crowded with pleasure boats , barges , steamships , extends about 30 miles along its three rivers .
