Mrs. Partridge Presents . The managing mother who manages to misfire completely in the last act is the portrait around which a number of smaller portraits are tastefully distributed . The smaller portraits are mostly her children and their friends . The misfire is the pardonable reluctance of her children to tread the pathways of artistic life which she has broken for them . <P> An artist and an actress her boy and girl shall be . Years of toil go into the proper nourishing of their temperaments . The boy prefers engineering ; the girl , matrimony . Mother loses . <P> Blanche Bates offered her usual determined and consciously complete performance . Elliott Cabot who , with Robert Benchley , is the most promising of the younger Harvard actors , made a keen impression on the critics . Quite the best of the troupe was Ruth Gordon ( Lola Pratt in Seventeen ) . She wandered in occasionally as the little girl from up the street and quite pulled the play from the grasp of the Partridge family . <P> Jack in the Pulpit . Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hero and Icebound , is now the defendant on two serious charges . Item : He has become a manager . Item : He has produced a fearful play . In fact , he has produced one of the season 's worst . Which , in this scrambled season , is almost a distinction . <P> Mr. Ames interprets the role of a crook who will inherit an immoderate amount of millions if he becomes for one year the pastor of a village church . After introducing to his astonished flock golf , jazz and auction bridge , after falling in love with the inevitable sweet and simple maiden , he reforms . <P> Marion Coakley , lured somehow into this dramtic litter , plays well ahead of her materials . Mr. Ames adds little to his established reputation . Most of the subordinates were valueless . <P> Othello . Walter Hampden is one of the most serious laborers for the better things of the Theatre . He is one of the few curators of the old things that are best . Therefore , when he brings back Othello , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play must give our stage is to be commended without stint . Granting , however , the sincerity and ambition of the effort , it must be said that Othello is in many places dull . <P> In the first place , Mr. Hampden 's version stretches across three hours and 30 minutes of the watcher 's time . The play is simply not sufficiently invigorating to sustain the stubborn interest of the casual attendant . In the second place , the interpretation of Mr. Hampden , scholarly and earnest as it is , seems somehow to fail the Moor . He plays Othello resonantly and with determination . Always he plays it ; never does he bring the suffering soldier to life . Furthermore , the Desdemona of Jeannette Sherwin is distinctly under standard . Iago ( Baliol Holloway , Englishman ) gives a curiously individual , irritating and yet undeniably admirable performance . <P> For people to whom any Shakespeare presentation is an educational essential , the production will be enormously worth while . To the rank and file who crowded so enthusiastically to Mr. Hampden 's Cyrano de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Stark Young- " Admirable part of this Othello was the spirit . . . everywhere evident a long study and a great ideal for the Theatre .
