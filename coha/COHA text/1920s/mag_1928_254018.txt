Inventor Nikola Tesla drew plans for a helicopter that would fly straight up from earth until safely high and then would cock over to fly like any other plane . Those plans he registered last week at the U.S. patent office , commenting that he would build no such helicopters himself but that they would work . His cocksureness arose from the fact that the multitude of his previous inventions had worked ( TIME , July 25 , 1927 ) .
