txt END THE TREATY FIGHT . Senate Contest Doing Harm to the Whole Country . To the Editor of The New York Times : The most absorbing public question in the United States today is as to what the Senate is doing with the Peace Treaty and the League of Nations and what is the cause of the irritating and altogether unreasonable and unbusinesslike delay in ratification . We are now probably the richest and most powerful nation in the world and should be respected by every country and Government , but unfortunately at this moment we are not only ridiculed by the rest of the world but we have lost their respect , and we , as a people . do not deserve to occupy this humiliating position . The Senate carries our honor and our character as a nation in its hands , and it has , I fear , proved recreant to its trust , and has , in effect , announced to the world that while we are rich in dollars we have no real stamina and do not loyally support our allies ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own shadows and willing to see the whole structure of many Governments and the happiness and safety of their people sacrificed in order to make a , longdrawn-out campaign issue of the League of Nations . I say without fear ' of successful contradition that upon this League depends the happiness and financial stability and even the food of many of the nations of Europe , and still some of our so-called wise Senators dare to daily with and split hairs over it when delays are grievously destructive . The American people want the treaty signed and the League put into effect at once and have wanted it for many months , as appears by the number of petitions presented to and delegations received by the Senate committee from representative bodies all over the country . The situation is that the Senate is merely splitting hairs , and we must search for the motive . As far as I can understand it , there appears to be an underlying intention to make the treaty a party issue in the next Presidential campaign , and a large number of the Senators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The situation is a most humiliating one for the American people . Delegations and petitions of the people representing the whole nation have urged in vain for the passing of the treaty and League , and not one representative voice has been raised against it . We were charged as a nation with only wanting to make money out of the necessities and terrible war strain in Europe , but we arc proud of the fact that we finally entered the war and held up our end in a magnificent way . After this splendid accomplishment we are now , to all appearances , deliberately going back on our allies and leaving the world to its fate without the courage to join in the efforts to prevent future wars , and possibly a greater and more disastrous one than that through which we have just passed . We have earned the suspicion and dislike of the civilized nations . We are giving aid and support to our enemies and building up the strength of Germany in Russia in such a way as to be a menace to the peace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be met and dispelled only by united action under the League . And why is this ? Not because the treaty and League are not acceptable to the American people and not even because they are not substantially approved of by the Senate itself , for on the one bone of contention , namely , Article X. , the Senate has already , by a majority vote , accepted the Lodge-McCumber reservation . If the situation were not so grave and full of peril it would be a farce , and it reminds one of Nero fiddling while a great city was being consumed in flames . If a largo number of the Senators are using the power delegated to them by the people simply to suit their personal purposes and absolutely against the expressed will of their constituents , it would look very much like a breach of trust . To relegate this question to become a party issue at the next Presidential campaign and be a football for the politicians is a subterfuge , and to allow this view of the matter to control his vote for political purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great honor and dignity and responsibility of being a Senator of the United States . If the Republican leaders do not get together and pass the treaty and League without further delay , it will spell disaster for the party for many years to come . It is reported that President Wilson would not approve of the League if the Lodge-McCurnber amendment is substituted for the original Article X. I can not believe that any President would take such a responsibility . If he should do so he would be more harmful to the public welfare than even Senator Lodge , and that is saying much . CHESTER GLASS . New York , March 6 , 1920 . Mrs. Caroline A. Creevey . To the Editor of The New York Times : Mrs. Caroline A. Creevey of New York , who died in Florida last week , was ooe of the real " intellectuals .

Mrs. Creevey was an expert botanist and her two valuable books upon flowers and plants are authoritative . She was a deeply religious woman , after the old undemonstrative New England pattern . In a delightful book of reminiscences , which she called " A Daughter of the Puritans , " she sketches inimitably her early religious experience . It was full of pathos , but was not without its humorous features , full of a subtle wit such as some of her friends had not suspected Mrs. Creevey of possessing . Few women whom Now York has lost In recent years will be missed as keenly by so large a circle of friends as will this gifted , strong-minded , strong-souled daughter of New England .
