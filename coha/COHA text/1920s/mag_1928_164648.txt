A little earth was taken last week from three places in France : the spot at Ver-sur-Mer where Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd landed last year , from Picpus Cemetery where Lafayette is buried , from the battlefield near Luneville where the first Americans fell in the World War . This earth was sealed in an urn of bronze and gold . The urn was then carried to the U. S. where it will be placed upon the grave of the late Rodman Wanamaker , who did much to further friendship between the U. S. and France . Men will do much to beautify that which they find most terrible ; thus the urn which is to contribute its comfort to Rodman Wanamaker 's grave was fashioned by the fore most iron worker in the world and a great artist : Edgar Brandt . <P> Workers in iron deal with a difficult medium and one which it is impossible to handle with two hands and a simple tool . Brandt , after he became successful in Paris before the War , had a large factory in which he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screens . During the War his plant was converted into a gun factory , and Edgar Brandt used his talent in metal for machines whose extreme beauty was that of cruel efficiency . When the War was over he designed the Bayonet Trench Monument near Verdun , presented by George Franklin Rand , Buffalo banker , and dedicated to the memory of the soldiers who had been killed at Verdun ; he made the grating that sur rounds the perpetual fire under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris . <P> His other works are scattered through out the world , in museums , on battlefields , in ocean liners , in parks or outside of great houses . Several are in the Louvre ; the architects of the Cheney Bros , building in Manhattan persuaded him to design the great iron doors , window frames , screens , trees for the display of their silks . He designed the tall iron gates at the entrance to the Exposition des Arts Decoratifs in Paris three years ago where he received the highest prize . Describing the things he has made by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a successful plumber who conducts his trade with an eye for symmetry rather than the clock . Such is not the case . When Brandt designs a clotheshorse the thing is as lovely as a statue ; his screens arc metal tapestries , executed with the clarity of silhouettes , touched with a unique grace , severe , luxurious and odd . Forty-five , a native of Alsace-Lorraine and a resident of Paris , Edgar Brandt has none of the look of a Latin Quarter esthete ; one would perhaps pick him out by appearance as a manufacturer rather than an artist . He talks like an artist , thinks like one , in practical , concrete terms .
