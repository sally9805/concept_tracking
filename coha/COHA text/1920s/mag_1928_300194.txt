A hawk last week perched on the balcony outside the Van Sweringen brothers ' private suite on the 34th floor of their high Cleveland Terminal Tower Building . The hawk twisted his head and coldly looked far down at the pigeons strutting , the sparrows hopping on Cleveland 's Public Square . They pecked away at crumbs , peanuts , popcorn . The hawk turned his head away . He darted it down at what one of his claws held , a strange bird killed at the tower while migrating southward for winter . <P> Clevelanders last week learned why the hawk fed leisurely outside the Van Sweringen windows . Atop the 54-story tower building is a huge beacon . Birds migrating at night are blinded by the glare , dash against the building , drop broken-bodied to the balcony projection . <P> The situation , however , is useful to ornithology . From the balcony Harold Lester Madison , acting director of Cleveland 's Museum of Natural History , is getting data on the birds which migrate across the district and on the relation of atmospheric conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usefulness can not last very long , because birds somehow learn to avoid man-built obstacles .
