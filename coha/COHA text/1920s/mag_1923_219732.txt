Indignant at Einstein 's reticence about his most recent discovery , Robert L. Duffus , writing in The New York Globe , claims that the lack lies in the scientist rather than in the reporters and the public . The truths with which such men deal , he says , can not be said to be discovered until they have been made as intelligible as murders or prizefights to the butcher , the baker , the candlestick maker . <P> Query by a physicist : " Is a man of science obligated to make primer copy out of phenomena that are understood by only a very few of the world 's keenest brains after a lifetime of study ? There is small doubt where the majority of scientists would stand if this question were put to a vote ! "
