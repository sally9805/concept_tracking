txt A reply to what was called the " latest attack of Sir Henri Deterding , head of the Royal Dutch Shell group , upon the Soviet oil industry , " was issued yesterday by Saul G. Bron , Chairman of the Amtorg Trading Corporation . " Sir Henri Deterding regards the approaching tenth anniversary of the inauguration of the Soviet Government in Russia as the proper time to make still another prediction that the Soviet Union is headed toward disaster , " Mr. Bron declared . " No one taking note of Deterding 's propaganda can escape the conviction that this is really the most inappropriate moment to make such a prediction . " Deterding says that the Soviet oil industry has barely attained the prewar level . He does not add that the Soviet authorities took over Russian oil fields five or six years ago with equipment almost completely destroyed by forces with which Detercling is not entirely familiar . Soviet money was used to reconstruct the industry almost from the bottom up to its present level , and this reconstruction required about 3300,000,000 . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet oil industry : Pre-war crude oil production was 9,230,000 metric tons , while production for the Soviet fiscal year ended Sept. 30 , 1927 , was more than 10,000,000 metric tons ; pre-war annual consumption of kerosene in villages was 8 pounds per capita , and last year 's consumption was 9.4 pounds per capita ; pre-war wages of workers in the Baku fields were 35 rubles per month , while during the year just ended the wages averaged over 75 rubles monthly . " Present production costs in the Bronzy oil fields are lower than before the war , while in the Baku fields these costs are about equal to those of 1913 . The output of gasoline from crude oil has been increased from the pre-war figure of 0.4 per cent . to over 0.7 per cent . Deterding also mentions the Soviet coal industry . It will be interesting to learn that coal production for the year just ended was 39 per cent . higher than the figure given by Deterding for 1912. "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
