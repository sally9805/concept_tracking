my town there are perhaps six thousand women . In the newspaper office there is a list of t ? o hundred women 's organizations . Assuming that these average a membership of twenty , this means that four thousand of these six thousand women are members of at least one women 's organization , ? sixty-six and two thirds per cent of the women in the town . Twenty is a very low average , since few run as low as fifteen and several run to a hundred ; but I have made it low in order to take care of the amount of overlapping , ? that is , women who are members of several organizations . The membership in women 's clubs alone , ? excepting the missionary and other church so cieties and lodges , ? runs to near fifteen hundred , which is fortyone and two-thirds per cent of the women in that town . Nor is this percentage peculiar to our town . In our town 's next door neighbor live perhaps twenty-four hundred women . In its newspaper office there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average membership to be the same , this means sixteen hundred women out of the twenty-four hundred in this town , or sixty-six and two-thirds per cent . There are percentages of all women , rich and poor , working women , mothers of large and small families , women with large incomes , and women with next to none . These percentages are tremendous . Two-thirds of all the women in that town belong to a women 's organization offering some degree of intellectual entertainment , ? almost one-half of the women to organizations devoted wholly to some kind of intellectual and social activity . The potential power of these organized women has been dis cussed many times before . Their relationship to reform move ments has been pointed out . They have even been made the basis of the argument that women are " organization mad " .  | They have been the butt of wit and the food for humorous divertisement . They are charged with the decline of States ' rights and the reign of lawlessness , of sentimentalism in politics . They are held responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opponents of these amendments . They are the object of scorn by the literati and political " highbrow " , ? of which the following quotation from the recent article of a well-known publicist is an example : " The tenth woman is an individual and not merely one of a herd , in the various futile leagues that delight the souls of nine-tenths of her sex . " But I am not here concerned with any of these phases of the so called woman 's club movement . There is an entirely different phase which seems so far to have escaped friend and foe alike . It has to do with the cause of these organizations . The spectacle of husbands congregating in clubhouses long ago posed a question which has been handled variously in play and story under a general title : " Why Father Left Home . " So far as I know , the spectacle of sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the women of small towns , ? I do n't know the percentages of the city , ? attending club meetings with some regularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Left Home , " much less why she left it for a club . And yet it seems to me the spectacle of hundreds and thousands of women walking off each week to spend two or three hours in company with other women , ? not gossiping or knitting or sewing , but in mutual improvement , or what they call that , ? is a phenomenon of no small social import . And more interesting , ? even challenging , ? when it is seen against the background of the social customs and habits of these women 's grandmothers , against the whole historical position of women as individualists , more or less isolated in homes , more or less feudal so far as women and their activities are concerned . When sixty-six and two-thirds per cent or fifty or even twentyfive per cent of a group , a class , a species do a certain thing , ? the same thing , ? do it over a period of time , must there not be back of this action some common cause ? And if all kinds of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not worth while to inquire what this cause is ? To find out what that cause is , we must first discover what clubs offer women .  | Let us first take a few concrete cases of club women . If we can find out why Mary George goes to a club we may be able to formulate a theory and then test it by applying it to other cases . Mary Smith is the youngest club member I know . She is a college graduate , married one year . Before marriage Mary was in an office for six months . It is apparent she is very young or she would either have been longer in an office or longer married . She was enthusiastic about the office . As she said to me , " I just adore the system of an office . It is so orderly and so interesting ! Some problem every minute to be solved . " She was efficient in the office . Her employer , a publisher , said to me , " She 's a good brain for a woman . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stay . " And she loved matrimony , too , ? meaning not only her husband , but her home and being married , the Mrs. before her name , the sense of importance , of being not only necessary to a man ( she thinks she is , praise be to her husband ! ) but of being a social personage with her name as hostess in the local paper , a committee member , a buyer at the grocery , department , and drug stores , the mistress of a house , ? front door and kitchen , ? the creator of a home . All these things she enjoys and their smaller symbols , such as pouring tea , receiving guests , showing off her china . Mary has married a professional man who has his way to make . They have a charming cottage . She has made it very attractive . She has bought for it all she can afford for next year . She is her own cook and maid . She is a good one . At first it took some thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook two meals each day without so much as looking in a cook book . She can even get up a company dinner without spending much thought on it , although she does spend as much as possible on menu and decorations and trimmings . She puts in hours embroidering MG on sheets and pillow cases ; she can now do it without pursing her lips or even thinking at all about it . In short , Mary 's brain has taught her hands to do her housework . They can cook and sew with very little assistance from it . She tries to keep up her reading . She puts in an hour or so a day at it . Sometimes she can persuade her husband to read aloud to her at night but not often . " I work my brain all day , " he says . " When night comes I want to play . Let 's go to the movie . " Never can she get him to discuss  | with her . " It 's my business all day to get ideas into stupid people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asks . So she has already stopped talking over the books with him . Her husband told the truth . " Working his brain " is his business . Her business is hand-work . Yet Mary has as good a brain , ? or at any rate , as active and well-trained a brain as his . And this brain , like any active organism , craves employment . Mary found this employment , as she told me herself , in the A. A. U. W. , ? the American Association of University Women , which has a chapter in Mary 's town . Mary joined it . She also joined a " group " to take up the study of the drama . Incidentally , does any one know of any Association of American University Men with drama groups ? Is this because men graduates get all the mental exercise they desire without having study groups for that purpose ? This explanation is worthy of consideration . " I needed some mental life , " Mary said , " if my brain was not to rust out utterly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brain . I do n't want to get out of the habits I acquired at college or lose my mental curiosity . I dare say there are women who can get mental exercise by solitary study but it is easier for me to do it if I have a stated time and a stated lesson and am engaged to other people to do it . Otherwise I 'm so lazy I drift . " Mary was a thinker , she knew why she did things . Perhaps the thousands of other young college women who are going into drama groups and psychology groups and home training and international relations groups of the A. A. U. W. also know . But how about the older club women , the ones who never went to college ? Why are they so crazy to write papers on Japanese art and listen to talks on the Far Eastern question ? Let us examine another specimen . Mrs. Barstow graduated from a small high school about thirty-five years ago . She was eighteen and very bright . She was married the next year . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own work , ? cooking , cleaning , washing , ironing , and baking , ? and tended the garden . She , of course , took entire care of her two children . She did all her own sewing . As I say , they were poor . The house was small . It did not take long to get over it . She could spend no thought on furniture or clothes , for she had no money to buy them , ? not much on food ,  | for she cooked only simple meals . And she , too , had the acti ' - mind . " I had done housework ever since I could remember . I was automatic with me . I could bake bread , wash dishes , peel potatoes , just as people run a car , without a single thought about it . In time I could go through my whole day 's , ? aye , week 's , ? routine without a single minute 's consciousness of what I was doing . But what had I to occupy my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to read to have something to think about . And then I wanted to tell someone about what I read . I joined a Chautauqua Club . That was the beginning of my club career and ever since I 've belonged to a club , sometimes more than one . I do an awful lot of reading and thinking that have nothing to do with my clubs . But they stimulate me to it . " There are a certain number of people , men and women , who enjoy manual labor , a certain number who are not fitted for any mental work , as well as a certain number who enjoy mixing the two , like the lawyer who works in his garden and the business woman who makes hooked rugs . There are also a certain number , women as well as men , who do not like any kind of manual labor , who like to work with their minds , whose minds , in fact , insist on working . When these people are men , even though husbands , they can choose work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to do any manual labor . But when these people are women and wives they , with few exceptions , have no choice . They are obliged to undertake an occupation calling for manual labor . That occupation is housewifery . Now with rare exceptions the membership of women 's clubs is composed of housewives . It is noteworthy that every organization furnishes some program either of entertainment or of study . It is noteworthy that nearly every woman 's organization , even though it be a lodge or a philanthropic organization like the W. C. T. U. , Jewish Council of Women , or Parent-Teachers Association provides something for its members in the way of program designed to entertain , uplift , or educate . Can there be any connection between these programs and the desire of housewives for some mental diversion ? Can it be that clubs were designed by housewives to satisfy their intellectual cravings ? Does " intellectual cravings " seem too ambitious a phrase to apply to the desire of women who are engaged in hand-work for an  | occasional activity of the brain ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . Even the words " brain hunger " are too strong . Perhaps " need of mental exercise " or " desire for mental diversion " would more nearly express their feeling . But for a few , the first phrase stands . And it is from these few that the leadership of these clubs comes . Did they see in clubs a way to capitalize the need of other women for diversion into an intellectual opportunity for themselves ? If my theory is correct clubs serve two purposes . What is my theory ? That the clubs ' programs satisfy the more or less unrealized desire of nearly all women handworkers for some diversion that appeals to thought in place of activity , while the management offers opportunity to the more active brains among housewives for creative work that shall not interfere with housewifery . One class want to be diverted . The second want to do the diverting . It is these latter who make club programs , become parliamentarians , and urge social reforms . I make no " claim " that these clubs are the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are a good solution . Like most social answers to individual needs they have developed out of the material at hand and did not spring complete from a master mind . Almost instinctively , it seems , tired housewives , finding a little leisure on their hands or achieving it , gathered together to talk and sew , then to talk about books , then to talk for improvement , then to read papers . Leaders saw an opportunity and grasped it . Or a leader gathered some women into her parlor for tea and gradually led them toward organization . In fact I make no " claims " at all . I merely suggest that it is reasonable to think that any movement so general and so spontaneous as this organization movement on the part of women has its beginnings in a common need . I find one thing common to all clubs , namely , diversion , entertainment , ranging all the way from a " home talent " program or reading " Evangeline " out loud , to a lecture on Esoteric Art by a college professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another to the intellect ( or what passes for it ) . And I try to discover what need it is this program satisfies . I find that the majority of these members are housewives . And among these housewives I find college graduates saying they hate to see their minds grow flabby or rusty or whatever it is happens to idle minds , unedu- cated housewives longing for " improvement " , bored housewx wanting diversion . I then turn to this business of housewifery . And I find manual labor . I mean by that that the business of housekeepi. makes so few demands upon a woman 's intellect that it may qui , literally be called manual labor . Note that I do not understand " manual labor " to mean unskilled labor . By no means . I understand it to mean work that is done by the hands and not work that is done by conscious brain operation . Doubtless the brain trained the hand . But practice has so coordinated the brain and the hand that action has become automatic . This happens to highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenters , plasterers , and painters . A novice could not do their work . Some workmen never become as expert as others . But the work of a trained worker is automatic . He does it " without thinking " . Housewifery comes in this class . Does any one doubt it ? Recall what the college graduate and the older club woman told me . Nearly every experienced housewife will bear them out in their contention that they can go through the routine of housework without using their brains at all . I have one friend who props her book in front of her while she sews , another who has read volumes while washing dishes . But most of us go through our work with our minds wandering over the pleasant field of introspection or speculation or meditation , like will-o ' - the- wisps , hither and yon , as they will , ? which is , of course , rather bad for our powers of concentration or reasoning . There are those housewives who employ other hands to do their work , who are what might be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine . Once having established a home and set up the routine , very little demand is made upon the director for the brain-work . Surely no one contends that the choosing of menus , the ordering of food , the checking up on dusting and sweeping , the ordering of one , or even two , servants requires much brain-work , ? especially the tenth or twentieth year one has ordered almost the same menus and run the same house . Let no one imagine I depreciate the housewife 's job . To express what I think of its importance and value would require an entire article . I fully realize how her days are filled with multitudinous  | details and interruptions and that the happiness , comfort , and welfare of many people depend upon her attention to this detail and response to the interruption . Only a professional worker who neglects these demands realizes fully their importance and their pull upon the nervous and physical energy of women . But I think few of these housewives will deny that neither detail nor interruption makes much demand on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the housewives , when gathered together , do not hesitate to express themselves as to the routine nature of their work and its effect on their mental activity . I dismiss the so called drudgery of housework as having no place in this discussion , because I am not talking of hard work or overwork ; and I doubt if routine work may be called drudgery , even though its tasks be uninteresting and even menial . Doubtless a college man with an active brain would consider it " drudgery " to do the janitor work for his office building , even if he were the head janitor , and certainly the tasks involved in housewifery , ? cooking , washing dishes , dusting , sweeping , ? in a home are quite like those of j anitoring , ? sweeping , dusting , and washing an office building . And doubtless many college-bred wives with active brains do regard their household tasks as drudgery . A very successful housewife whose home was such a model of comfort and beauty and she so expert at cooking and sewing that I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've gotten breakfast every day for thirty years and I 've hated it every single morning . I hate housework and every part of it . Yet I 've been condemned to spend my days doing it . And why should n't I ? " she continued . " It takes no brains to cook or sew . Look at the women too stupid to do anything else who make good servants . It was my duty and I did it . Do n't talk to me about making it a profession or enjoying it . Fancy Jack ( her husband ) condemned to working in a garden or being a stenographer all his life ! And he 's no abler than I. In fact I ranked him always at school . " But my object is not to discuss housewifery except in its relation to women 's clubs . Drudgery would not drive women to clubs but to rebellion , suicide , or slavery . That housewifery has done none of these might indicate that women find pleasure in their work . I think most of them do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming automatons . And the escape from that is in ment employment for leisure moments . They get some of this in clu They get at least an intellectual stimulus . So they find clubs solution to their needs . They go to clubs , not as a substitute for housewifery , but as a diversion ; they seek them not as an alternative , but a supplement . Think not that women make no efforts to employ their minds creatively in their housewifery . Many have been the efforts of individual women to exercise their minds in housewifery ; and tradesmen , professional decorators , and builders , ? even magazine editors , ? have striven to help them to change housewifery from a manual occupation to a profession . Witness the elaboration of entertainment , the changing style in curtains and color schemes , the fashions in dress . All of these make a slight demand on brain power . And who has not seen the young housekeeper strive to keep her mind busy with parties and curtains and cakes that were " works of art " ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years on end ! The demands of a family set in . They find necessities to be provided in such numbers , so many details to be handled , so many interruptions that before they know it they are systematizing their job and , except for the occasional refurnishing and rebuilding , become automatic housekeepers . In this connection I remember how , soon after I was married , I organized a Domestic Science Club to study food and dietetics , house decoration , china . In addition to our programs on these subjects , each hostess in turn served a luncheon to cost forty cents a plate and , for menu cards , wrote the cost of each dish and the calories it contained . At the same time most of our members joined a Shakespeare Society . We got training at the Domestic Science Club . In the Shakespeare Club we found escape . The Domestic Science Club disbanded in a few years . The Shakespeare Society is still vigorous after twenty-five years , and the same members enjoy the modern plays they read and put on . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They give wonderful recipes , marvelous patterns which these women use , each one trying to compete with her neighbor in the newness or perfection of menu or dress . But writing about work does not make it intellectual and eternally making new dishes and new dresses does not stimulate a tired or idle brain . The women 's  | magazines have long realized this . The better ones , ? aye the more popular , ? are giving more and more attention to club movements , club questions , to books and questions of the day , and less to making a cult of housekeeping . To trace the connection between this change in magazine " copy " and the women 's club would be interesting , but this is not the place for it . There is a connection , just as there is between improved housekeeping methods and clubs . Although undoubtedly women went into clubs for intellectual food or stimulation , they took their problems with them . Many of those problems they are discussing . Out of this discussion will come solutions . Perhaps the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women Who Are Club Women ? " Of that thirty-three and onethird per cent who are not , a goodly number doubtless have no needs that a club could fill , among them professional and working women who feel like professors and business men about intellectual diversions . This is equally true , of course , of many who belong to clubs . They join because it is customary , " the thing . " But this need not weaken my argument , for it only became " the thing " when enough women felt the need to make it so . And evidently they are the kind that other women want to follow . In this thirty-three and one-third per cent are doubtless many women who can better satisfy that need in other ways . There are the scholars who pursue their studies separately and alone . There are the students who subscribe to " courses " by mail . There are those who " keep up their reading and French and music " by themselves and have no need for outside stimulation , sometimes feeling superior to those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join a club , business women whose time schedule does not permit it , who sometimes feel resentful that clubs are designed for housewives so that there is no place for them . There are working women who have neither leisure nor opportunity . There is also the small sophisticated and the very rich group who , not coming under the classification housewives , have no needs clubs would satisfy . No one of these groups seems to me to offer any evidence tending to contradict my theory of the club for the sixty-six and two-thirds per cent who do join clubs . But perhaps there is other evidence . After all , it is but a theory and , as such , open to discussion .  |
