T. A. D. ( Tad ) Jones told the Yale Athletic Board quite a while ago that when he got through coaching the 1927 football team he wanted to retire . Yale men asked him to reconsider ; Jones did not change his mind . Last week his resignation took effect . Faced with the problem of chosing a new coach the Yale Athletic Board turned naturally to Marvin Alien Stevens , a handsome young man who came to Yale in 1922 from Osborne , Kan. , played halfback on Mallory 's eleven , proved himself a brilliant open field runner , an accurate place kicker , a good punter , and who for the last three years has coached the backfield and studied at the Medical School . Stevens will carry on Tad Jones 's system which he probably understands as thoroughly as Jones . He has a contract for three years .
