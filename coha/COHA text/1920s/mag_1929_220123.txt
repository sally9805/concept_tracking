Big money can not be handled in the dark without stirring some people 's suspicions . To dissipate suspicion , President Hoover , by executive order , last week , lifted the curtain of secrecy from the Treasury 's income tax operations , sufficiently to reveal the important details of all tax refunds above $20,000 . It was a move long demanded by progressives and Democrats in Congress and as long opposed by Secretary of the Treasury Andrew William Mellon . The White House ordered the new policy ; the Treasury obediently executed it . <P> Secretary Mellon , after the 1924 experiment , has disliked tax publicity . Last February the Senate was agitating publicity for tax refunds in the first deficiency bill. * Charges had been made that Mr. Mellon 's department had secretly doled out large sums in the dark to a favored few . Mr. Mellon wrote to Senator Warren , Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee , reviewing the " gauntlet " which tax refund claims had to run in the treasury . Said the Secretary : <P> " This system completely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the procedure in mind it is difficult to see the exact point at which a public hearing could be properly injected . ... I respectfully urge that the provision for a public hearing on these matters be eliminated from the bill . . . . Whether the final decision of the Department should be a public document presents a somewhat different problem , though it would seem such action is open to most of the objections above enumerated . " <P> Congress nevertheless passed the bill containing , in modified form , a refund publicity clause drafted by Tennessee 's loquacious Senator McKellar . So soon as Herbert Hoover became President , Senator McKellar attacked the reappointment of Secretary Mellon with a resolution directing the Senate 's Judiciary Committee to enquire into Mr. Mellon 's fitness-for-office . <P> This inquiry is not yet afoot , but President Hoover last week called his Treasury chief to the White House and told him what he wanted in the way of tax refund publicity . Mr. Mellon returned to his office , wrote a letter to the President recommending what the President had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The new policy will give the public " the amount of the over-assessment , a brief summary of the facts and a citation of the applicable statutory or judicial authorities . " More important , it will create a new set of public precedents governing tax refunds , which will help to guide taxpayers through the maze that is the Internal Revenue Bureau . <P> Secretary Mellon said he took the action because of " unexpressed Congressional policy " and added : " The publication of the decisions will . . . show conclusively that the Treasury has nothing to hide , that there . is nothing mysterious about tax refunds . " <P> The political wisdom of the new policy is obvious . It robs the anti-Mellon group in the Senate of their most tangible excuse for attacks on Mr. Mellon , of which the real motives have been partisanship and personal bitterness . Michigan 's Senator Couzens , a stout Republican , yet long Mr.Mellon 's bitterest antagonist , admitted the order was " an advance " and twitted the Secretary on his changed position .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
