STOP <P> WHISKEY <P> I 'm the happiest little woman In all this little town ; And my merry laugh and singing Takes the place of sigh and frown . <P> For JOHN HAS QUIT HIS DRINKING And is like himself once more , And the world is just a paradise With such happiness in store ! <P> That headline , that poetry and the sketch of " John 's Wife " with her mouth open heavenward in praise of a drunkard 's nostrum or reaching for " John 's " de-alcoholized kiss-last week commanded attention in many a U. S. newspaper which profits from quack-advertisements . Presumably , enough whiskey continues available in the U. S. to gamble that a good percentage of newspaper readers would " fall " for a cure . Such cure Dr. J. W. Haines , of Cincinnati , offered to provide in his powders . They contain milk sugar , starch , capsicum ( pepper ) and a minute amount of ipecac-a useless and fake dope against alcoholism , declares the American Medical Association . <P> But the purveyor of that nostrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients . He has a precious name . He calls it the " Golden Treatment , " and thereby he trades quackishly on the fame of the late Dr. Leslie E. Keeley . Keeley Cures ( a few still exist ) loudly but dubiously used the double chloride of gold in " curing " drunkards . <P> Keeley had had a formal medical education at Rush Medical College ( now University of Chicago Medical School ) and practiced as an Army surgeon for a time . Later the Chicago &; Alton R. R. employed him as official surgeon . That was in the period when the Women 's Christian Temperance Union made Ten Nights in a Bar Room a gospel of propriety , when the late Carrie Nation and her harridans heaved hatchets through expensive back-bar mirrors and at good mahogany fixtures . On that temperance agitation Keeley rode . Dwight , Ill. , became the " Mecca of Liberty , " the " Drunkard 's Divorce Court . " <P> The theoretical but unsound basis of his cure was the double chloride of gold . He prated : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has an affinity for the poison in alcohol . . . . Gold acts on the higher cerebral nerve centres , the seat of the diseased will and the mania for strong drink . " Because his treatment had some practical success , simple folks fixed their memories on gold . Therefore the subtle plausibility of the Haines Golden Treatment . <P> The real benefit that Keeley gave his patients was rest , nourishing food and rigorous physical hygiene . He made the drunkard take a bath every third day and change his underwear every four or five days . They were " cured " in a month , so happily and so numerously that they formed a " Grand Army of American Drunkards. "
