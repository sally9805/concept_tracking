Conspicuous , during the last fortnight , have been two minor lawn tennis tournaments in England , wherein the leading amateur women racquet-wielders of the world were thoroughly trounced by a modest 22-year-old , Helen Wills . In the North London finals , she defeated Elizabeth Ryan ( U. S. ranking No. 2 ) , 6-2 , 6-2 . In the Kent semifinals , Miss Wills ran burly Mrs. Molla Bjurstedt Mailory ( U. S. ranking No. 1 ) around the court for only 23 minutes , disposing of her , 6-0 , 6-1 . Next day , that skilled tactician and Wimbledon champion , Mrs. L. A. Godfree ( the onetime Kitty McKane ) threatened but could not conquer Miss Wills . <P> The appendicitis operation of 1926 has long been mended and a new Miss Wills has been evolved-a harder-hitting , more accurately chop-stroking Miss Wills who critics expect will win both the Wimbledon and U. S. championships .
