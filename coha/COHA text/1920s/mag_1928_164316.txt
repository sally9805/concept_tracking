BLACK MAJESTY-John W. Vandercook - Harpers ( $2.50 ) . <P> The Man . Haiti is a hot island , of listless winds , of low and cloudy mountains . Most of the people who live there are black or brown or yellowish because of their African blood ; this was true also some hundred years ago , but then , beside the 500,000 sweating black slaves and the 24,000 effete , lazy , clever yellow freedmen , there were 40,000 whites-French planters , who danced and tippled in the big houses and ruled the island .

A succession of dark generals led their ebony soldiers to cruel and bewildering victories . Ugly Toussaint , who beat a Napoleonic army , was captured and sent far away to die . Clumsy Jean Jaques Dessalines made himself emperor of the black island and imported two ballet masters to teach him how to dance ; before he had time to learn , a soldier murdered him . Henry Christophe , the billiard marker , during all this time had done more than watch the sudden noisy game of war that his people were playing in the lazy island . He had learned how When Dessalines died , Henry Christophe was made president for four years , then appointed King .
