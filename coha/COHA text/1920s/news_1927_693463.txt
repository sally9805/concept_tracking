txt Its sylvan name and the passion of strangers for mythology have long made the Bowery a national highway . Years ago amateur social researchers could find various matter there . Shops , " museums , " restaurants , theatres rich in moral melodrama and family parties ; the quiet , orderly , long-lived Atlantic Garden , with its " Vienna Female Orchestra " ; dives , " divans , " saloons , rescue missions , " freaks " ? bill changed every week  --  sailors ' dance halls . But one got tired of the Big-headed Baby and his congeners . One came to think of the Bowery , regarded as a site of " tough " citizens and the nurse of spirited " life " at night , pretty much as Tartarin regarded the Alps , " arranged by the Company . " One remembers the lament of the leader of the Volksgarten orchestra , who always wore an " opera hat " in the daytime : " When I was " in Boston I lived among the best peo " ple . What have we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant a conglomeration of visitors , tricked by catchpennies , and ccming to see what was n't worth seeing . Years afterward the street was purified and reformed . It was drab , respectable , given to trade ; but the myth would n't die . From the ends of the country and the world men and women come to see the Bowery of their dreams ; at its best or worst never the thousandth part as much a fraud as San Francisco " Chinatown " guides exhibit to the innocents . The Bowery has never ceased to be a national highway . That noble chant , " The Bowery , " lately sung by some famous statesmen , has been , perhaps still is , a national hymn . One has heard it even at New England dinners on Forefathers ' Day : They do such things and they say such things On the Bowery , the Bowery , And I 'll never go there any more . This begetting of poetry by myth is no new process . In the February Harpers Mr. STEPHEN GRAHAM , a wanderer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " shows us " The Bowery Under Prohibition . " According to him , " it is still the most curious and " adventurous street hi town , and it is " the place in New York where the Pro " hibition law and other laws are most " openly set at naught . " There is a " free surge of alcohol * * * at any " of a score of saloons I just go in and " get served . " In some places one can get a drink for ten cents , only twice the price of the worst in the famous " barrel houses " of New York and Chicago . It is cheerful stuff : " After two glasses " you feel poisoned for two days ; " the nerves of the nose still register " from it . " Drunken men abound , and hoboes . To the latter at least Mr. GRAHAM , who has tramped so much , ought to be sympathetic . Well , if things are so bad on the Bowery , we 'll never go there any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oftener ; but is it cynical to wonder if the Bowery is not at its old trick of myth-making ? To Mr. GRAHAM " the Bowery is a strange , haunting , haunted street . " ' He quotes from " The Secrets of the Great City , " a title that suggests certain romantic descriptions of Manhattan wickedness written , if we remember , by the Rev. MATTHEW HALE SMITH : Respectable people avoid the Bowery , as far as possible , at night , but on Sunday night few but those absolutely compelled to visit it are to be seen within its limits . Every species of vice and crime is abroad at this time , watching for its victims . Evidently the respectable citizens of German and other origin who used to go to the Atlantic Garden and other respectable places on the Bowery Sunday nights must have taken their lives in their hands , and their lager only for the purpose of forgetting that they were " haunted .
