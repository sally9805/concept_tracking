txt It has been a general conclusion , as near a certainty as anything human can be , that under the present terms of labor agitation nothing short of confiscation will ever satisfy the unionized worker , or , what amounts to the same thing , his autocratic leaders . Certainly the distribution of the entire gross profit amongst the workers , irrespective of skill , would not be satisfactory . The Plumb plan , with the endorsement of the American Federation of Labor . proposes to do precisely this , and to make up the deficits out of taxes collected by the United States Treasury . The standard set for wages is not what the work is worth . It is " all the traffic will bear " , and then some . But there is a happy union in sight . One of the railroad unions , the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes and Railway Shop Laborers , is to become a manufacturer of clothes in order to reduce the cost of apparel to its members . It is therefore , out of the funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the American Woolen Co. and other manufacturers . It need hardly he said that this factory will start as the most tightly closed shop in the United States . It can do no less . Moreover , there are conditions , endorsed by its parent union , which now becomes a capitalist manufacturer , which will show us the way to secure contentment among the workers . It is one of the planks of the platform of the communist party in America that a skilled workman is not of the proletariat because his skill in itself constitutes property . This is strictly logical . It follows the line of that great economist Lenine , who objects to having the proletariat . or anybody else , taught to read and write as tending to create unsocial inequalities . The factory employes of the shopmen 's union therefore will govern the factory , with the votes of the most numerous ' - but least skilled workers . Their wages will not merely he on the highest union scale . Their hours will not merely be the shortest in the United States . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway shopmen 's union will make up the deficits out of its own treasury in order to sell the manufactured clothes to its members at anything approaching the figures of competing manufacturers . This is , of course . exactly what the unionized railroad men propose , through the Plumb plan , as the method of fixing railroad wages and hours . If the workers in the clothing factory do not enforce every condition here set forth they arc false to the program of unionized labor . They should be more union than the unions themselves . I. W. W. agitators and Bolshevist teachers should be openly on the salary list . Perhaps Foster of Chicago . the great steel leader , would accept the congenial task of organization . He has no illusions about the sanctity of the railway unions . Here is the sobering prescription at last . If the acting government of the United States , the Anti-Saloon League , will permit the description . it is called " a hair of the dog that bit them " .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
