txt It is understood that Mr. HARDING 'S Consultations at Marion are about finfehed . He is to enjoy a holiday far frorrt he madding best minds . All ' his Visitors , however Vey may differ With each other , are of one accord in praising the next President 's personal courtesy as well as his lofty conception and desires for his country and the world . It has been a charming fellowship , apparently , all through . Senator HARDINU himself has testified to this , and has added that he had found it much easier than he had expected to hit upon a general agreement . regarding our true international policy . But on this pleasing optimism Senator POINDEXTER poured something of a cold douche just as he was leaving Marion on Tuesday . He remarked that , so far as he could gather from his interview , " Senator Erna " DING 'S plan has not yet ' reached the " detailed stage . " Thus the great new Republican I scheme for an association of nations I le ready  --  all but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project may never emerge from the realm of a pious hope . Everybody Will admit , even HIRAM Jou N9 ON admits , that there ought to he some kind of agreement among the nations to free the world from dread of another great war ; but as soon as anybody undertakes to say precisely What agreement the angry objections begin to hurtle through the air . that we May Bot have got on so far as we thought in the Marion conferences . The existing state of the case is not unlike that which often attends legislation in France . There the Chamber is asked to affirm the " principe " of a proposed law . After that there comes the work of " rklaction "  --  and that is the crux of the whole ' business . It is the details which are really the essence of the Case , and over them the hapless legis ? lators grow pale with the necessary labor . It is comparatively simple to get all the visiting statesmen at Marion  --  it Would be to get the Senate  --  to approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that into action , especially into the form of words recidisite for a treaty , is a labor which the gods may delight in , but which is sure to pain the physics in the AdIninistratiOn and in Congress . In such matters , when we say that we have achieved all but the details , we really say that we have achieved nothing . The work is all to be done . Air . HARDING will have to find some than or men to spend days and nights of toil upon his project , which so far appears to be only an airy sketch . Some talk lightly about " mere matters of detail . " Lord SALISBURY used to say that this meant that you were Content with a " mfre dream . " A thousand and one things will have to : be wrestled. with in drafting a new association of nations . Then there will be the somewhat formidable " detail " of getting a two-thirds vote In the Senate . Another little detail will be the modest request to forty66ven'nations to throw away the work On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted as the best thing attainable in this imperfect ' world , and cheerfully to begin all over again on undefined lines . - There is no reason-to speak slightingly of what has been done at Marion . Mr. ? HARDING has kept his promise . He has taken counsel with some of , the ablest men . in both parties . But the whole has been only preliminary spade-work . The real Job has yet to be - tackled . The details of it may seem petty , even miserable , but each one of them will be found vital . And we are confident that . as honest and competent ' men apply their minds to the task , they will be more and more driven to the conclusion that it would be an act o ' incredible folly for this country to re . fuse to build upon the foundations 01 the League of Nations . Why unsett1 ( everything ? Why ask for better bread than can be made of wheat ?                  @ @ @
