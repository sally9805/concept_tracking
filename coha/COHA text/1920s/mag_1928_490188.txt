AMANHATTAN dweller usu- ally feels loyalty for the particular section of the island in which he resides . Gramercy ladies are true to Gramercy after their fashion ; Villagers cling to their Sheridan Square ; Sutton Placers are sentimentalists on the subject of the East River . This loyalty bobbed up most unexpectedly in a man we have heard about who lives with his wife on %Vest Twenty-second Street , where houses still have doorbells and dignity . When a girl baby was born to them recently , they named her Chelsea . The husband tells us that there is strong likelihood that the first boy will be called Watkins , after the phone exchange . This latter we regard as a very tender sentiment , and one which we encourage . It 's going to be a bit rough in some instances , however . Nobody , presumably , wants a baby named Dry Dock . IT 'S hard , we find , to be greatly im- 1 pressed by the fact that Mr. Harry Payne Whitney , Mr. Clarence H. Mackay , and General Cornelius Vanderbilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that token , the clubbiest men in the country . There is a great deal more to club life than just the mere fact of membership . It is the part that a man 's club plays in his life that really matters . His Majesty the King of Italy , for example , is a , member of the Rotary Club , which is not swank at all ; but think of the ineffable satisfaction Victor Emmanuel III must get out of hearing his brothers call him " Vic " ! And where , we ask , for all the fine life of the clubs to which they belong , will Messrs . and Gen'Is . Whitney , Mackay , and Vanderbilt find any club-joy comparable to the true thrill experienced , let us say , by a member of the Book-of-theMonth Club who runs across a fellow member in the lobby of a hotel far from home ? SOMETIMES we wonder how little boys are getting along in these horseless , barren clays , all is so different from our own childhood . Garages have taken the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president of a motor car company has made the statement that the time is not far distant when automobiles will he sold on a house-tohouse basis  --  and this naturally reminds us of our boyhood experience with house-to-house salesmanship . It was a dismal period in our adolescence ( and it comes to every boy ) when we set out manfully to sell subscriptions to the Saturday Evening Post from door to door so that we could buy a pony . It was a sop to a youthful sorrow , and we hoped it would become like a little business of our own . But abject terror seized us as we pushed doorbells , and a horrible sinking feeling gripped our heart as we asked the " lady of the house " to subscribe . Think of the little boys of today , and worse still , of tomorrow . What will they suffer at pushing a doorbell and asking , in a high squeaking voice : " Da you want to buy a Lincoln today , lady ? " THE town houses of persons of excessive wealth are fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stately pleasure domes that used to make Upper Fifth Avenue a veritable Xanadu have crumbled before the wrecker 's advance . Hunted and hounded , the rich have been driven away and have taken cover in Park Avenue apartments . Of course this is a thing to regret , for New York should be primarily a city of homes . For the benefit of the few home owners still left on Fifth Avenue , we advance the suggestion that they meet economic pressure on its own ground . Simply devote the first floors of the mansions to attractive store fronts , as have some of our best hotels . The store rentals would help meet the bedroom and bath maintenance . Furthermore , the stores would be a new note  --  a portion of the house the owner would thoroughly understand as compared to his art and music rooms . And the owner 's weekend guests would find shops handy in case they forgot their toothbrush , or anything . The spirit THE latest service at the Roxy is shoe repairing , we hear . When a lady 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens in a misstep on a stairway , she is ushered to the ladies ' lounge , a matron removes her shoe , and it is sent out to be fixed . It is done rapidly and it is free . Lady Into Fox Mfg . Co . ALWAYS interested in this city 's 1 . phenomena , we went around to a shop on Madison Avenue where a lady has been in business for twenty-one years making cigarettes and proving the truth of the mouse-trap story . Although she has a list of eminent customers that reads like the morning papers after the opening night of the opera season , we dare say the masses know little of her . Her business nevertheless has grown steadily , the output now being between six and seven hundred thousand cigarettes a month . The lady has the interesting name of Miss Raenar Fox . She was christened Eva but a French kindergarten teacher called her Reynard which she changed to Raenar and adopted . Her father and his father were tobacco merchants and she apparently inherited a flair for the business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris , she got the idea that she could make fine cigarettes as well as anyone and twenty-one years ago she started to prove it . Gathering together the makings , she rolled a few samples and called upon Mr. James Clarence Harvey to try them . He liked them so well that he ordered two thousand , at thirty dollars a thousand , which is sixty cents the package of twenty . That is now a fairly law-priced Fox cigarette . Some others run from sixty to one hundred and fifty dollars a thousand if you go in for peculiarly fine blending and monograms and , as a few of her customers do , twenty-two carat gold tips . Mr. Harvey , Miss Fox related , recommended her product to eight Philadelphians of his acquaintance and their orders formed the basis for her opening a shop . Now she has the shop and a factory , at 100 Fifth Avenue , with many skilled assistants . Even so , she still fills personally the orders of her more touchy customers . She can roll some three thousand cigarettes a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DuPont , who has smoked for two decades the special brand she contrived for him . Then came many others , including Clarence Mackay , several of the Vanderbilts and Mr. E. K. Bedell , for whose cigarettes the paper alone costs forty dollars a thousand . On each paper is embossed Mr. Bedell 's coat of arms . It was natural that organizations would follow the lead of distinguished members and now she has the City Club , the Princeton Club , and numerous others , and several steamship lines . For the first thirteen years her books held not a single woman customer but for the past eight , half her business has been feminine , she reports . Another One THE newest niche in the taxicab hall of fame is held by Joseph Conrad . Mr. Conrad 's favorite stand is around the Metropolitan Opera House , for he is by way of being an admirer of music and a bit of a critic . As a matter of fact he took us uptown after a special matinee recently and said , as we got out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought some of the singers this afternoon were very much out of voice . " In Wonderland WE spent last Saturday morning , at the invitation of the Bell Telephone Company , in its vast laboratory building in West Street . They were having an exhibition of television at 11:30 , but we arrived ahead of time and were shown into the auditorium during some demonstrations of the movietone and the vitaphone . What caught our fancy most was a visible and audible history of the development of B. &; 0 . railroad engines . Trains , ancient and modern , were seen and heard to roar up out of the distance with a crescendo of locomotive whistles and bells . Ordinarily we shoulder on our overcoat when the backstage clamor begins in a movie , but we liked this particular film-and-record with its first far-off whistles , lonely as youth , and the final thunder of passing trains . In another room to which we wandered during a recess , a dozen or more historic phones used in famous long distance talks are preserved , forever mute , in glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by President Wilson . The most interesting is the one over which Alexander Graham Bell talked from this city to Thomas Watson in California , inaugurating the transcontinental service . The latter is the man to whom Bell , from another room , spoke the first words ever said over a phone : " Dr Watson , come here ! ' All that is left of the apparatus used in that famous call is a bit of insulated wire which some unknown souvenir hunter kept and later gave to the company . Among several photographs of heroic operators is also a picture of the first New York City operator : her name was Mamie and she had gray hair . We were interested to learn that the simple little transmitter you now talk into represents the ninety-eighth stage of its painstaking development . The television demonstration properly awed us . The receiving " grid " is like a tiny movie screen . It looks simple but it has , we were told , twenty-five hundred points of contact and is really quite complicated . The lights went out , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black and white patterns across the screen . Finally these steadied into a picture of a card with the Bell trade mark on it . The sending machine was at the other end of the auditorium , about two hundred feet away , but the result would have been the same if it had been thousands of miles away . Several persons took turns standing before it and talking . One blew smoke rings , another drew a picture . Their forms were promptly flashed onto the screen and their words , loudly magnified , synchronized exactly . The images were clear and steady , whereas they were fluttery during the talk between President Gifford of the phone company and Secretary Hoover last April . ONE of the engineers who brought this thing into being quietly explained some of the early problems it presented . One was to prevent the person talking from losing his eyesight or being fatally burned by the high concentration of a point of light that is necessary . An unsung laboratory expert conquered that by some profound magic with light . There is no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machines at the sending and receiving ends . If the motors were so much as one hundred thousandth of a second off , there would be no picture . That difficulty was conquered too , by high frequency control over the intervening space . As we were pondering this infinite tinkering with time the engineer remarked casually to us that something was five thousand million milli on times as big as something else . We arose , bowed to the rapt scientist at our right , and staggered quietly out into Serving Them Right AYOUNG woman from Passaic hastened into a casting agency on Broadway , so they say , and asked for a job in a show . " What experience ? " they asked her . " I have n't had any experience , " she replied , " I just had an awful fight with my hus band and his family so I decided to go on the stage and embarrass them . " Mammy India IN a room in Fifty-seventh Street , tucked away from the hustle of the town , the followers of the Yogi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vibrate every cell in their being , to heal nasal catarrh . And from his flower-bedizened dais , the skinny Yogi translates earth , fire , and water for the ladies . We 'd been aware , in a general way , that open-faced housewives were susceptible to Indian thought , but the ritual came as a big surprise the other evening when , in our persistent search for life 's nectar , we joined a group . About two hundred people were sitting on camp chairs . The converts were mostly women -- elderly dames with brittle faces and imperfect digestions , the sort of ladies you see on the porch at Lake Mohonk . There were twelve men . Of these , four were colored , four looked like carpet-baggers , and four like William Jennings Bryan . The Yogi wore a long orange robe with turban to match , and at intervals pointed with dark , bony fingers to a wall chart depicting the Super Yoga Science  --  the Door of Parabaruman , the Left Nandi , the Right Nandi , Ajna , and Navel Power . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a fat boy wandered stealthily , about , adjusting windows and keeping an eye out for persons not of a sympathetic attitude . The free part of the lecture was given over largely to a para bl e  --  a pale tale much like those a Sunday School teacher invents in the first flush of Christian duty . It was about the mate- rial house and ( you guessed it ) the human house . The Yogi 's teaching was a pleasing mixture of Coueism , Childs dietetics , first aid to the injured , mysticism , and Bernarr Mac fadden , combining the best features of each . He passed quite easily from varicose veins to self-mastery . The big surprise , to us , came when the responsive chant began  --  that was where we felt out of it . It seems there are twenty servants of the human house , and the chant went something like this : Yogi : " Left foot , one ! " Ladies : " Left foot , one ! " Yogi : " Right foot , two ! " Ladies : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up through calf , thigh , haunch , abdomen , chest , and neck . Stomach is number ten . The whole chorus of voices responded ; and as they intoned the words , the audience swayed forward and each touched the spots named . Then there came the secret of life , which is pretty much hound up in something you take before breakfast  --  a few sips of honey and about twenty , or possibly twenty-one , almonds . There was a responsive chant for milk also . " How do you heat it ? " asked the Yogi . And in unison the ladies shouted : " In a double boiler ! " " What do you put in it ? " asked the Yogi . " Pepper ! " cried the delighted ladies . In general the Yogi was against pickles , cigarettes , sugar , and meat , and in favor of giving Nature a chance . He was in favor of tonsils and appendices as is . He was against glasses . The general instruction ( in the free lecture between eight and ten ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Law of Abundance . The latter part was given over to drumming up trade for the next night . " Rheumatism ? Show you tomorrow night . Cancer , glasses , cold in the head ? Show you tomorrow night . " And the benediction was also responsive  --  a long list of " I am 's , " ending in the phrase , " I am successful , I am success . " We thought we detected a certain poignant truth in this , for a rough estimate gives the Yogi about six hundred converts ( he 's been here since last fail ) and at twenty-five dollars a head  --  which , we were told , is the price of the special course  --  his success would be somewhere in the neighborhood of fifteen thousand dollars . Next month he goes to Washington , where ladies also have catarrh , and leisure . ? PTO add to our collection of inter- " esting subway guards , a man about town gives us Number 01108 of the I.R.T.

Home is the Sailor THE last time the President Roose- vat sailed we braved a storm to wave at some happy people who were going with it The ship departed from Hoboken , never an alluring place , and , what with the rather mean weather and a small sailing list , the handkerchief flutterers were few . A little huddle of people watched the Roosevelt leave and then went over to the opposite side of the dock to watch the Republic which sailed a few minutes later . We were attracted by two gentlemen dressed more warmly than anyone else there , as if they were unaccustomed to sloppy weather and fearful of consequences . Each had a heavy overcoat well turned up about his chin , one carried a floppy umbrella , and both wore overshoes . We figured them for sedentary gentlemen until we caught a glimpse of their faces , weather-beaten , strong , kindly , with quick keen eyes . Turning to a man associated with the steamship company who was with us , we questioned him . " The stocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rescue ' Randall of the Republic , the other is Captain George Fried of the Roosevelt , who made the Antinoe rescue . " We expressed astonishment that their ships were sailing without them . This , it seems , happens often  --  a new skipper is tried out , changes and promotions are made or the regular captain deserves a rest . Both these notable men , it appears , will shortly have larger ships to command in the shift brought about by Captain Hartley 's retirement . The last we saw of them they were going inland without a look backward , still warmly " tucked in " : outside , in the drizzly rain , Captain Fried promptly sprung open his umbrella , held it over his comrade and away they went , stepping carefully around puddles . Blue Eyes FROM a man who prowls behind the wheels of Washington we learn of the solution of a mystery that had baffled the Civil Service Commission for many years  --  ever since , in fact , a certain Virginia gentleman was made head of an important department of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Civil Service list he invariably noted : " Blue eyes preferred . " When , the other day he closed his desk for the last time , he explained his little secret to an eager staff  --  most of whom had , of course , blue eyes . He told them , and they were a little hurt , that he really did n't care for blue eyes more than for other kinds  --  his own were brown , his wife 's gray . He just wanted to make sure that no colored people would be assigned to his office . Fifty Years of Badminton OF a Saturday afternoon we advanced through two inches of slush upon the Twelfth Regiment Armory . Inside , we found the Badminton Club , as is its wont on Saturday afternoons , alternately drinking tea and playing badminton . Fifty years of tradition looked down upon the proceedings . They are allowed to smoke now but that is the only innovation in years . The visual background was a drill-room floor , arc lights and military equipment including a fleet of motor lorries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep in New York society , and the celebration of the Badminton Club 's fiftieth birthday this week rates as a social rather than a sporting event . Still we got an unexpected kick out of watching badminton played . More fun to watch , we thought , than squash , and , to our notion , more fun to play . There were fourteen courts , all in use . Over the five-foot nets the players lobbed and walloped and sometimes babied the fickle thing they call a bird , though the English for it is shuttlecock . It was tennis in a court about one-third as big and with a net twice as high and racquets ( bats in England ) so frail that impact with a tennis ball would demolish them . Seeing a badminton player in action reminded us somehow of the last time we went fly swatting in a big way . But how they do swat the bird ! And what a lot of neat science and deceit and skill goes into the service . We saw Van Winkle , the club champion , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Going into history we learned that this game originated in India , that it is played a , lot in England and Canada , that it was introduced in New York in 187% and was for many years the thing during Lent . Tea and the social amenities rather overshadowed badminton in the beginning . The sport was thought too strenuous for ladies of the eighties , but later they took it up . They wore trains and picture hats . The men played in Prince Albert coats and chokers . Things went along like that until 1900 when someone told Lyle Mahan , the tennis star , about Goelet Gallatin , the undefeated champion of the club . Mahan made a bet he could beat Gallatin if they 'd elect him to membership . They elected him and at his first appearance on the court Mahan removed his coat and vest . Shocked patronesses demanded an apology . They did n't get it and tennis togs have been an fait ever since . By the end of the season Mahan had taken Gallatin on and beaten him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means in America , since the club in New York is the only one of its kind here . He gave up playing some years ago because nobody could make it interesting for him . For years the club , which is limited to two hundred members , had a long waiting list . Then came a slump , attributed by the club historian , Walter Rysam Jones , to the advent of the motor car and the new fad of going out of town for the weekend . There were vacancies instead of a waiting list . More recently a revival has brought the membership up to one hundred and sixty-five . The club is run autocratically by an executive board of seven who elect their own successors . You ca n't even be put up for membership unless one of the seven knows you personally .
