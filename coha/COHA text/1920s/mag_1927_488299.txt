Washington , October 18 ril HE trial of Albert B. Fall , former Secretary of the Interior , and Harry F. Sinclair , millionaire oil man , for conspiracy to defraud the Government in the Teapot Dome affair has begun in Washington and newspaper dispatches for the next few days are going to read suspiciously like chapters from the novel " Revelry , " Samuel Hopkins Adams and the government prosecutors having been inspired by the same set of facts . As the two defendants scrutinize the faces of the twelve men who are about to pass judgment on them , they doubtless reflect hopefully on the fact that juries are not made up of justices of the United States Supreme Court . Just one week before they went on trial , the Supreme Court ended the Government 's civil suit to set aside the Teapot Dome lease declaring that the transaction had been fraudulent , that there had been a " clandestine " and " sinister " transfer of large funds to Fall , some of them certainly and the remainder probably from Sinclair , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - - That was the highest court of the land speaking without a dissenting voice . On the same evidence that the court reviewed , the jury will decide the present criminal conspiracy case . It is a long and devious trail that leads from the Fall ranch near Three Rivers , New Mexico , to the jury box at Washington . On New Year 's Eve , 1921 , Sinclair arrived in his private car at the ranch . There , so far as is known , the present codefendants first discussed the Teapot Dome project . Three months later , on April 7 , 1922 , Fall signed the Teapot Dome lease in strictest secrecy , giving Sinclair exclusive rights to all oil in the 9,000-acre naval reserve in Wyoming excepting about 6 per cent which eventually was to go into storage tanks to be built for the navy by Sinclair . The lease did not state the proposition so baldly , but that was the way it was to work out . In defense of the deal it was said that the navy 's oil was being drained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court has said that the principals knew this was not the case and acted in bad faith in using it as a pretext . Even had there been serious drainage the Government was protected , for , as Senator Walsh pointed out , the Government received 25 per cent to 50 per cent royalties on all oil from these adjacent wells . So that if every drop of Teapot Dome oil had been drained by outside wells , the Government still would have received more of it through royalties than through the Sinclair lease which cost the nation ninety-four barrels of oil for every six tanked . If Sinclair merely had outdone Fall in a trade , the Government could have done little about it . But the prosecution believes there was something more in the bargain and the Supreme Court is inclined to agree . One month after the lease was signed , and while Fall still was in the Cabinet , Sinclair , so the Government charges , caused $230,500 in Liberty bonds to reach Fall 's son-in-law , M. T. Everhart , of Pueblo , Colorado . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of these bonds , falling back on the rule against compulsory self-incrimination . The Government traced $90,000 in bonds directly to Fall . All of the bonds were traced by serial numbers and were found to have been drawn by H. S. Osler , a Canadian lawyer , president of the mysterious Continental Trading Company , a resale corporation formed under Canadian laws about the time Sinclair was considering the Teapot Dome opportunity . Osler refused to testify in the civil trial or permit his deposition to be taken , and the Government never was able to get direct evidence that he was acting for Sinclair. , Other witnesses left the country during the civil trial and the two most important ones , H. M. Blackmer and James E. O'Neil , have not yet returned , despite many attempts to get them back for the present trial . As an official of the defendant Mammoth Oil Company , Sinclair did not testify in the civil suit , and the Supreme Court said : " It justly may be inferred that he was not in a position to combat or explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government 's case . " The Continental company was dissolved at about the time of the Teapot Dome investigation , and its records were destroyed . The Supreme Court said it was plain that the company was organized for " some illegitimate purpose . " " The clandestine and unexplained acquisition of these bonds by Fall confirms the belief , generated by other circumstances in the case , that he was a faithless public officer , " the Supreme Court stated . " There is nothing in the record that tends to mitigate the sinister significance attaching to that enrichment . " This episode was discovered by the Government 's special prosecutors , Owen J. Roberts and Atlee Pomerene . Working under the most exasperating handicaps they have built up their evidence until it forms an important element in the prosecution 's case . Much of the other material , practically all of it , was developed by Senator Walsh in the Senate 's investigation . This reveals the secrecy leading up to the lease of April 7 , 1921 , and the refusal of Fall to permit any information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate by resolution demanded it ; the sharp rise in Sinclair Consolidated oil stock during this period ; the loan of $25,000 in Liberty bonds made to Fall by Sinclair under circumstances which the Supreme Court considers suspicious ; Sinclair 's payment of $1,000,000 to clear up minor claims on the reserve and his promise to pay an equal sum to others who were threatening lawsuits over their uncertain rights ; and , finally , Fall 's dispatch of marines to the reserve to clear off the last stubborn squatters . That incident is best described by the marine captain who led the raid , George K. Shuler , later State Treasurer of New York . He was told to report for orders to Fall ; his account of that picturesque interview as given to the Senate committee follows : I went over to the Interior Building and the Secretary was waiting there and I went in and he said : " I have got a job for some marines . We have a naval reservation out in Wyoming , - the Salt Creek country , and there is an oil company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , they are drilling a well , " and he says , " We know that they have no rights there " and that he had called on the Secretary of the Navy to detail some marines to go out and drive them off . And he said that he had taken the matter up with the President that morning , and that the President did not want to take this action because an officer of the company that was trespassing was a close personal friend , and contributed to the campaign fund . And Mr. Fall told me he had told the President that his friend was a low-down s.o.b. , and Mr. Fall said that the President told him that he supposed he was all that when he sent him his check , and Mr. Fall said that he told the President : " Mr. President , by God , he was . " But he said the President finally consented , and that was why the marines were to go out . He said " What would you do if they served an injunction on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Secretary , I have never seen an injunction in my life , and would n't know one if I saw it , and if they served one on me I would file it . " He said , " I guess you will get along all right out there . " To have reached the point where his friend in the Cabinet not only gave him an exclusive right of way in this rich government oil reserve , but insisted on sending out marines with fixed bayonets to drive off Harding campaign contributors , marked new heights of power in the spectacular and successful career of Harry Ford Sinclair . He had not begun very auspiciously . His father was a druggist in Independence , Kansas . Harry went to the University of Kansas to study pharmacy . When his father died , he took over the store , but he was not successful and soon he was spending his days hunting . One day he happened to shoot himself in the foot . An accident policy gave him enough to start a small business selling timber to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas . He bought into a drilling pool . Soon young Sinclair felt the first thrill of big luck in oil . The gamble of the business gripped him and he kept on playing . He expanded rapidly and in twenty years he rose to one of the dominating places in the industry , with more than twenty companies engaged in oil producing , refining , and marketing , in coal , water transportation , exploration , pipe lines , Mexican production , real estate , and publishing . His holdings reach into almost every corner of the world where there is oil . He offered to take over the entire oil business of soviet Russia . As Sinclair 's fortune mounted into the millions , and doubtless into the tens of millions , he began to enjoy the expensive luxuries of millionaires and to gratify the sporting instinct which had made him love the oil business . He was one of the backers of the old Federal League which undertook to break the grip of organized professional baseball . He built up the Rancocas stables with a fast line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago won the international race against Papyrus , the English derby winner . He became the friend of the high and mighty . Cabinet members went to the races as his personal guests . Political managers tactfully sought campaign contributions ? Will Hays collected $75,000 from him when the Republicans passed the hat to pay off the Harding campaign deficit . As a crowning distinction , the Kansas drug-store boy finally was offered the throne of Albania , the legend is , if he would apply his talents , and probably his bank roll , to the job of straightening out the poverty-stricken treasury of that kingdom . But the uncertainties of a Balkan kingdom offered no lure for a powerful emperor of oil . Sinclair is still in his early fifties . Such hair as he has left is untouched with gray . His eyes are cold and calculating and there is a hard-set line about his mouth  --  and with some reason , for he got where he did by grim fighting in one of the most ruthless of industries . He has driven his way through obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest him . He is impatient of politicians . Ite dislikes their nosing ways . In the La Follette gasoline investigation Sinclair had to be subpoenaed before he would produce some of his records although other oil men were submitting theirs voluntarily . When he appeared before the Senate Teapot Dome committee he refused to answer certain questions and as a result was convicted by a jury of contempt of the Senate and is now under sentence to spend three months in a " common jail " and pay a $500 fine . The case has been appealed and Sinclair is free under bond . He appears in court a sleek , somewhat defiant figure , lacking much of the sentimental appeal of the kindly , obliging Doheny . That twinkling , elderly little man succeeded in creating an " old pal " atmosphere about his relations with Fall . He completely disarmed the jury and they refused to believe that he was anything except a kind old gentleman who wanted to help his old friend , Fall , out of debt and to help the navy prepare itself against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of refusing to answer the Senate committee 's questions as Sinclair did , he came forward voluntarily and admitted sending the $100,000 to Fall . He repeated his story to the jury in his conspiracy trial . Sinclair has remained doggedly silent , refusing to exploit sentimental or patriotic motives . In the present trialhis attorneys may insist upon adopting the strategy which Doheny found so successful . But it is not Sinclair 's own way . He is a fighter and bows before no storm . - This is Fall 's second appearance here on conspiracy charges . He did not take the stand in the Doheny trial . He never has explained his false testimony before the Senate committee . After he had received $100,000 from Doheny and from Sinclair at least $35,000 testified to by Sinclair 's attorney and possibly $230,500 from the Continental Trading Company , he told the committee in writing : - It should be needless for me to say that in the purchase of the Harris ranch , or in any other purchase or expenditure , I have never approached E. L. Doheny or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or H. F. Sinclair or anyone connected with him or any- of his corporations , nor have I ever received from either of said parties one cent on account of any oil lease or upon any other account whatsoever .
