txt Gerhard M. Dahl , Chairman of the ; Board of Directors of the Brooklyn Manhattan Transit Corporation , was formally charged with contempt of court yesterday and ordered by Justice Jeremiah T. Mahoney to appear in Part I of the Supreme Court this morning and show cause why he should not be punished for refusing to answer questions put to him in the Transit Commission 's inquiry by Samuel Untermyer , special counsel to the commission . It was said last night that the case , when called , would be adjourned until nest Tuesday . In the papers , the chief of which is an affidavit by John F. Gilchrist , Chairman of the Transit Commission , twenty-one instances of Mr. Dahl 's refusal to answer important questions are cited . The record of the Transit Commission 's hearing is quoted at considerable length , the papers as filed constituting forty-six printed pages . It is further alleged that Mr. Dahl and Albert H. Wiggin bought their stock in the Interborough Rapid Transit Company at a price lower than they bought the same stock for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter corporation . Obstruction Alleged . Both Mr. Wiggin and Mr. Dahl are charged in the papers with seeking to obstruct the Transit Commission in performing its duty as prescribed by the law , which ordered the preparation of a plan for the unification of rapid transit , and the testimony of Mr. Wiggin is quoted as against that of Mr. Dahl to the effect that the purpose of the purchase of I. R. T. stock was to influency : mt .. - acgotiations that might be begun between the city and the Interborough . It is set forth , too , that contempt proceedings against Mr. Wiggin will be begun simultaneously with those against Mr. Dahl. but papers in the second suit were not filed yesterday . In the specific language of the Court Mr. Dahl and his attorneys are directed to appear to show cause " why a warrant or order of commitment should not issue committin the said Gerhard M. Dahl to jail for refusing , without reasonable cause , to answer legal and pertinent questions when ordered to do so by the Transit Commission , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions , although specifically and repeatedly directed to do so by the Chairman of the Transit Commission , and for such other and further relief as to the Court may seem proper . " 1 The affidavit of Chairman Gilchrist recites the authority for the hearing and its purpose and the calling of Mr. Dahl as a witness . Great stress is laid on the fact that besides being the " guiding genius " in the B. M. T. Mr. Dahl has been a Vice President of the Chase National Bank and was formerly a partner in the firm of Hayden , Stone &; Co. , stock brokers . His " family corporation , " the Waubesa Corporation , is also explained in the Court . Twelve pages of the printed affidavit are then given over to printed extracts from the record , showing Mr. Dahl 's twenty-one refusals to answer . Questions Not Answered . Summarized , the instances are as follows : Mr. Dahl refused to answer as to whose bank account the Waubesa dividends were paid into ; be refusedl to answer as to whether moneys were borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer whether the Waubesa Corporation had dealt in other than Stock Exchange securities ; he declined to produce the minutes of the corporation ; he refused to answer when he began to accumulate 72,000 or 77.000 of the common stock of the B. M. T. ; he refused to answer whether he bought and sold in the market ; he refused to answer whether the stock of the Waubesa Corporation was in his own name ; he declined to say how much money was put into the Waubesa Corporation ; he declined to say when he gave orders for the purchase of 19,650 shares of L R. T. for the B. M. T. It is charged he further refused to say whether , when buying for the B. M. T. , he was also buying for the Waubesa corporation ; declined to answer whether he was selling I. R. T. stock ; refused to say whether the 19,650 shares were all that was bought for the B. M. T. , or whether the B. M. T. sold any of this stock ; refused to answer whether he had borrowed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined to say how much I. R. T. stock the B. M. T. owned at any time ; declined to say how much of that stock the 13 . M. T. had sold in the last three olonths ; refused to say whether he , Thomas L. Chadbourne and Mr. Wiggin had been trading in and out of the market ; refused to say how long Hayden , Stone &; Co. had been carrying stock for the B. M. T. ; declined to say whether Waubesa certificates were endorsed in blank ; declined to say whether he directed the Purchase of I. R. T. stock for the i3 . M. T. after be had bought his own I. R. T. stock ; refused to say whether he bad been in the market the day or two before he testified ; declined to give dates and prices of purchases of B. M. T. stock for his own account . In each of the twenty-one instances the record of the hearing is quoted giving the witness 's refusal to answer . Chairman 's Complaint . Chairman Gilchrist , saying he is advised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then affirms : " The refusal of the said witness , Gerhard M. Dahl , to answer said questions was and is without reasonable cause and is arbitrary and contumacious , and for the purpose of interfering with , delaying , hindering , impeding and obstructing the preparation of the comprehensive plan of readjustment which the commission , under and pursuant to the provisions of said section 106 of the Public Service Commission Law . is directed to prepare after making the necessary preliminary studies and investigation , and that the said refusal of the said witness Dahl to answer said question blocks and obstructs the commission in making its necessary studies * ? * and directly impedes and obstructs the commission in the preparation of such a plan . ? ? * " Argument is made as to the necessity of an investigation and study and the pertinence of the questions put to Mr. Dahl and the attention of the Court is directed to the provisions of the Public Service Commission law to the effect that the commission shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is pointed out that the B. M. T. borrowed money to buy the I. R. T. stock , although no emer. gency was shown to have existed . The facts that Mr. Wiggin also bought stock and the bank lent money to the B. M. T. in connection with the stock purchase are also dwelt on . The interest of the city in all this is brought out through a recital of the corporate connection between the B. M. T. and the New York Rapid Transit Corporation , which has the lease of the city-owned lines . The connection between Mr : Wiggin , Mr. Dahl and Mr. Chadbourne is discussed at some length , each having bought I. R. T. stock , and the striking circumstance that each of them refused to answer the same questions . The testimony of Mr. Marston . Secretary-Treasurer of the B. M. T. , that he could not say whether Mr. Chadbourne and Mr. Wiggin bought their I. R. T. stock before the purchase of such stock for the account of the B. M. T. had been ordered by Mr. Dahl is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conceded that he saw opportunities for ' irregularities ' in such methods of doing business . " Wiggin 's Testimony Quoted . Mr. Wiggin 's testimony is quoted at length as to the purpose of the purchase of Interborough stock being the hope that " we , " meaning him-self , Mr. Chadbourne and Mr. Dahl , might have some influence when the city began negotiating with the Inter borough , which was acknowledged to be a competing company . This admission is referred to as an admission that the real purpose , " partially ; at least , " was to obstruct the dealings between the city and the I. R. T. The assertion is then made that the commission is entitled to a chance to prove that the three men bought their I. R. T. stock and traded in it and then " bought I. R. T. stock for the B. M. T. at a higher price than their own stock . " It is asserted that the holdings of the three men and Mr. Croft of Pittsburgh totaled about 25,000 shares , just the amount which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. T. All these things , the affidavit recites , have a direct bearing on the necessary studies to be made before a unification plan can be drawn , as have the refusals of other witnesses to answer collateral questions ; and it is charged that the purpose of the alleged obstruction was " to prevent the carrying out and consummation of any proposed plan with the I. R. T. Company unless the B. M. T. Company was likewise taken along , entirely irrespective of the city 's best interests in said regard . " The affidavit says : " The refusals to answer on the part of Dahl and Wiggin and also on the part of Andrews ( Vice President of the Chase National ) , emphasized and accentuated by the similar refusals on the part of Dahl 's and Wiggin 's associate in the B. M. T. , Mr. Chadbourne. all lend color to the theory that the circumstances of the acquisition of I. R. T. stock by the B. M. T. should be carefully investigated , and would have a material bearing on the formulation of any plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being taken by the B. M. T. and its responsible officials so as to deal with the I. R. T. and the stock thereof as to tend to obstruct and prevent , or at least to have a controlling influence in , the dealing between the City of New York and this commission with the said I. R. T. " Chadbourne Perhaps Exempt . Inasmuch as the papers in the case deal almost exclusively with the actions of Mr. Dahl and Mr. Wiggin , both of whom are officials of the B. M. T. , and mention Mr. Chadbourne only incidentally , it was considered possible last night that Mr. Chadbourne , who is in Europe , may escape an action for contempt on the theory that as he is not an official of either transit company , the jurisdiction of the commission to inquire deeply into what he regards as his personal affairs might be successfully challenged . It is quite probable that the readjustment hearings will be brought to a close today by Mr. Untermyer , with the further examination of Paul S. L. Bolger , operating engineer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subways , combined , could be made to pay a profit at a five-cent fare in fifteen years . He has nine other elaborate schedules on which Mr. Untermyer will examine him today . These are expected to show that the city will not be nearly so well off financially if things remain as they are , or in case of any other combination of lines in unification , as it would be if the Interborough was purchased and the B. M. T. lines were recaptured and these two systems combined with the new city subways . Mr. Untermyer has said that Mr. Bolger probably will be his last witness . James L. Quackenbush , for the Interborough , has said that he will not attempt to put in any testimony until after the readjustment plan is drafted . Nathan L. Miller , for the B. M. T. has not committed himself as to T. , he will call any witnesses , but the indications are that he will follow Mr. Quackenbush 's example and wait until the plan itself is before the commission before putting in opposition evidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be closed today . Former Mayor John F. Hylan , who on Monday issued a statement in Manhattan , which was largely a reiteration of his former attacks on the commission and Mr. Untermyer , issued yesterday in Queens substantially the same statement , again prophesying that the present inquiry would bring shoat an increase fill fare .
