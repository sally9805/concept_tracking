BEETHOYEN 'S musk was the child of the same imperious forces of nature that had already tried their strength in the author of the Con ? fessions . Both were the flowering of a new season . . . . I can not help admiring those young ? sters that shake their fists at Rousseau and Beethoven . It is much as if they defied the spring and fall , the destined withering of the leaves and renewal of the blossoms ! . . . Rousseau and the Sturm and Drang were the April showers and equinoctial storms , announcing that an old civilization had broken up and that a new one was about to appear . Before the new society could be built man had to free himself as an individual . For individualism in revolt was at once a prophecy and the prerequisite of the Order to come . Each thing in its time ! First , the self ; later , society . Beethoven belonged to that first gen ? eration of young Goethes in Germany ( not so different as one might think from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Columbuses that , launched in darkness on the hazardous sea of Revolution , discovered the Self and conquered it greedily . Hav ? ing triumphed , they abused their con ? quest ; they thirsted for power . Each Self , in its new freedom , longed for command ; and when this was impossible in reality , sought it in art . All of life became a field for deploying battalions of thoughts , desires , regrets , despera ? tions , and melancholies . The self had been transformed into an autocrat . . . . After the Revolution , the Empire : and Beethoven carried both under his skin . Their coursing in his veins was the cir ? culation of the very blood of history . For , just as the imperial venture , which had to await Hugo to find a poet worthy to sing it , had already inspired its Iliad , from the time of Beethoven 's sympho ? nies and sonatas before 1815 , so , when Napoleon fell at Waterloo , Beethoven the imperator abdicated also . He too , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speck in the sea , more lost even than the little island in the African ocean , for he could no longer hear the waves break ? ing against his cliffs . He was immured . And when the voice of those last ten years rose from the silence , it was no longer the same self : Beethoven had re ? nounced power over men , and was with his God . But in this article , which is merely , as it were , the chronicle of the early cam ? paigns from Marengo to Wagram , I shall study the Self that had found expres ? sion in struggle . And I must begin by roughly outlining its features . For though , with our perspective of a hundred years , it is easy to see at a glance in what respects this mountain formed part of the range of that distant period , we must also distinguish in what way it dominated it ; what valleys , precipices , and slopes separated it from the surrounding peaks . The Self of Beethoven was certainly not that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neoGothies , or impressionists , with the Roman builder . Everything in them repelled him : their sentimentality , their lack of logic , their undirected imagination . He was the most masculine of musicians . There was nothing ( or , perhaps , not enough ) in him that was feminine ? and I con ? fess that , except for certain pieces , I have never enjoyed hearing him interpreted by women . Neither was there any trace in him of that wonder-gaze of chil ? dren , for whom art and life are a game of soap bubbles . Not that I despise such children ! I love their wonder ; and , like them , I find it beautiful to see the world reflected in shimmering bubbles . But it is still more beautiful to embrace it , as Beethoven did , and possess it . He was the male sculptor , subduing his material and molding it to his hand : the master builder whose workshop was na ? ture . For those who can see the vistas of the mind that are lighted up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the " Appassionata , " the most striking fea ? ture of these works is not the vastness of the armies engaged , the floods of sound , the masses hurled into the at ? tack : it is the mind that directs them , the imperial reason . But before considering the work let us consider the workman . And first let us reconstruct the frame in which he dwelt . He was built of sand and lime , for the mind in Beethoven was founded on strength . His body was athletic and sinewy . One may picture him a thick ? set , squat figure , with broad shoulders ; burnished face , roughened by wind and sun ; heavy black hair erect like a for ? est , with bushy eyebrows and beard up to his ears ; the brow and roof of the skull wide and high , " like the vault of a tem ? ple " ; powerful jaws , " which would crush walnuts " ; a lion 's muzzle and a lion 's voice . Not one of those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was embodied force , " said the poet Castelli . " Kin Bild der Kraft , " wrote Seyfried . And this strength did not desert him until the last years ? not until the attempted suicide of his nephew , which touched him to thequick . The word " Cyclopean , " used by Reichardt and Benedikt , characterized him well . Others compared him with Hercules . Gnarled and pitted with smallpox , he was a sturdy fruit of the age that produced Mirabeau , Danton , and Napoleon . He maintained this strength by vig ? orous bathings in cold water , great care in physical cleanliness , and daily walks , which began immediately after lunch and lasted throughout the afternoon , sometimes even into the night . On top of that a long , heavy sleep , which he complained of resentfully . " I am so unfortunate , " he wrote to Wegeler , " as to have to give too much time to it . " His diet was substantial and simple . No excesses , no gluttony ? and no heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused . He loved life like a good son of the Rhineland , but did not abuse it , except for the brief period with Holz ( 185-26 ) , when he was in despair . His luxury was fish , which he ate more than meal- But his cooking was rustic and crude ; dainty stomachs rebelled against it . His two " pretty witches , " Unger and Sontag , the singers of the Ode to Joy , whom he entertained , were ready to give up the ghost after one of his lunches . Under the daemon that possessed him his external life grew more disordered as he grew older . There should have been a woman to watch over him . Lacking one , he forgot to eat ; he had no home . But there was no woman ready to devote herself wholly to him . And perhaps his independence refused in advance to accept the obligations such a devotion would have entailed . Yet he loved women and needed them . The place they occupied in his life was larger than in that ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other great musician . I shall come back to this sub ? ject later . But , although his ardent na ? ture craved love , and love eluded him less than has been claimed ( we shall see that he fascinated women and that more than one offered herself ) , he was on guard against them : he was on guard against Iove itself His sexual conti ? nence , however , has been exaggerated . Certain notes in his diary , in 1816 , prove by the disgust aroused in him that he had tasted the satisfactions of a night . But his conception of love was too ex ? alted for him to cheapen it in these " bestial " encounters , as he called them . Eventually he suppressed all sensuality in his emotional life And when the once beloved , and still beautiful , Giuli ? etta came in tears to offer herself he re ? fused her contemptuously . He was de ? fending the sacredness of his memories against her . He was also defending his art , his God , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my energy thus what would have been left for nobler uses ? " This dominion of the mind over the flesh , this rugged moral and physical con ? stitution , together with his temperate living , should have assured Beethoven an invincible health . Roeckel , who saw him , in 1806 , stripped and splashing in the water like a Triton , said that " one would have expected him to live to the age of Methuselah . " But he had a heavy burden of heredity to carry . More than likely , a tendency towards tuberculosis , which came from his mother ; from his father and grand ? mother alcoholism , which he resisted morally , but which must have left de ? fects in his organism ; a violent enteritis , from which he suffered early ; and , per ? haps , syphilis . In addition to all of this , weak eyes and deafness . Yet it was from none of these ills that he died , but from cirrhosis of the liver . And even then , accidental circumstances deter ? mined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of his last illness , brought on by his reckless return from the country to Vienna , in icy December weather , without winter clothes and in an open milk-cart ; and when this seemed to have been checked , an outburst of anger which caused a relapse . . . . Of all these cracks in the structure , the only one that deeply affected his spirit was , as we know , his deafness . But at the starting point of his ca ? reer ? which for other men would have been the goal ? when at the age of thirty he had already conquered first place be ? side the veteran Haydn , his strength seemed intact , and he was proudly aware of it . He that frees himself from the bonds and gags of a decaying world , from his old masters and gods , must prove himself worthy of his new liberty : he must be able to use it . Otherwise , let him stay in chains ? The first condition of a free man is force . Beethoven ex ? alted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? estimate it . Kraft fiber allesi ? The fore ? runner of Nietzsche 's superman stirred in him . If he could be extravagantly gen ? erous , it was because such was his nature , and it pleased him to scatter his booty royally among friends in need . But he could also be pitiless in his lack of con ? consideration , and he often was ? nor am I referring merely to his fits of rage , in which be respected nothing , not even his inferiors . He professed at times the morality of the strongest , a " ustrecht " : " Force is the morality of men that stand out from their fellows ; and it is also mine . " He was rich in scorn : scorn of the weak , the ignorant , the masses , and the aristocracy , even of the good folk that loved him and admired him ; a scorn of all men , which at bottom was terrifying , and of which he was never entirely free . As late as 1825 , he was writing : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snarling , sneaking drabs of human souls . " In a letter to his intimate friend , Amenda , in 1810 , he expressed his con ? tempt for Zmeskall , who was to remain faithful to him to his last breath , even having himself carried on his sick bed to a nearby house when Beethoven was dying , in order to take his part in the terrors of the last days : " I value him and his kind , " Beetho ? ven had written , " merely for what they give me . I consider them nothing but instruments for me to play on when I feel like it . " This boasting cynicism , which he paraded before his most devoted friends , was to appear more than once in his life , and his enemies did not forget it . When Holz first entered into relations with him , about 1825 , Steiner , the publisher , sent word to him that he was a fool to go to any trouble for Beethoven ; that Beet ? hoven would discard him when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famuli . And Holz promptly repeated his words to Beethoven . In every period of his life such in ? stances were contradicted by the torrent of his deep humanity . But it must be admitted that the two currents , love and contempt , frequently clashed in him , and that in the full tide of his youth , when success was breaking down all dams , it was contempt that boiled over . I am not idealizing ; and tender souls must make what they can of it . I am describing the man as I see him . It is in this same trait , however , that we shall recognize the sublimity , in the ancient style , of the fate that overtook him , like ( Edipus , in the most sensitive spot of his pride and strength ? his hear ? ing , the instrument . of his superiority . It tempts one to believe in Hamlet 's words : . . and that should teach us There 's a divinity that shapes our ends Rough-hew them how we will . " Let us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fall to our knees . Let us cry , " Heiligl Heilig ! Blessed be the misfortune that befell thee ! Blessed be thy sealed ears ! " For the hammer alone is not enough ; there must also be the anvil . There would have been no tragedy , but merely an item of news , had fate found a weak ? ling , an imitation great man , to bend be ? neath the burden . It found a man of its own caliber , who seized it by the throat , and wrestled with it savagely through the night till dawn ? for him , the final dawn ; whose shoulders touched the ground only in death , and who , even in death , was carried a victor on his shield . A man who turned his wantinto wealth and his infirmity into the magic wand that opened the rock . Let us return to his portrait , at that decisive hour when misfortune was about to enter . Let us savor the lasting delight of that struggle in the arena be ? tween the nameless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This superman over whose head the storm was gathering ( for peaks attract the thunderbolt ) was marked , as with smallpox , by the moral characteristics of his time : the spirit of revolt , the torch of the Revolution . This had already be ? come evident in the days at Bonn . As a student at the University , in 1789 , Beet ? hoven had attended the lectures of Euloge Schneider , the future public prosecutor of the department of the Lower Rhine . When the news reached Bonn that the Bastille had fallen , Schneider kindled the enthusiasm of his pupils with a fiery poem , which he read in class . The fol ? lowing year Hofmusicus Beethoven sub ? scribed to a collection of revolutionary poetry , in which Schneider cast the de ? fiance of a future democracy at the feet of the old world : " To scorn bigotry , break the scepter of stupidity , and fight for the rights of man is a task no prince 's valet can per ? form . There must be free souls who prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . And let it be known that among such souls , mine shall not be the last to offer itself . . . " Who is speaking ? Beethoven al ? ready ? The words were Schneider 's , but Beethoven made them flesh . The young Jacobin , who was to have plenty of chance later on to change his political ? cal , but who never changed his moral , convictions , carried this haughty pro ? fession of republicanism into the salons of Vienna where , from his earliest successes , he rode rough-shod over the aristocracy that feted him . . . . The elegance of a dying world : never had it been more subtle , more delicate , or worthier of love ( in default of respect ) , than during this vigil that preceded the arrival of the cannon of Wagram . One is reminded of the Trianon ; but how superior , both in taste and culture , were these aristocrats of Vienna at the open ? ing of the new century to their exiled princess , the daughter of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music with a more com ? plete passion , nor shown greater favor to those who make possible their enjoy ? ment . One might almost think the Viennese were doing penance for their abandonment of Mozart , huddled into a pauper 's grave . In the years between the death of the unhappy Wolfgang and that of Haydn the aristocracy of Vienna humbled itself before art and paid court to artists ; it prided itself on treating them as equals . The ' 27th of March , 1808 , marked the apogee of this consecration : the corona ? tion of music . On that day Vienna was celebrating Haydn 's seventy-sixth birth ? day . At the door of the University aristocrats rubbed elbows with musi ? cians , waiting for the son of the wheel ? wright of R.ohrau , who arrived in Prince Esterhazy 's carriage . With a roar of drums , trumpets , and acclamations , Haydn was carried into the hall . Prince Lobkowitz , Salieri , and Beethoven came forward to kiss his hand . Princess Esterhazy and two other great ladies threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man , who trem ? bled with emotion . The delirium in the hall , the shouts and tears of enthusiasm , overwhelmed the author of the " Crea ? tion . " In the midst of his oratorio he left in tears and , from the doorway , con ? ferred his blessing on Vienna . A year later Napoleon 's eagles had pounced down on Vienna ; and Haydn , dying in the occupied city , carried the old world with him into the tomb . But the youthful Beethoven had al ? ready known , and despised , the gracious i smile of this old world , which cast the / cloak of its aristocracy under the feet of artists . And he trampled on the cloak . He was not the first of those peasants ( the two first had been Gluck and Rous ? seau from the Danube and the Rhone ) who saw the arrogant nobility scurrying to please them , and avenged the humilia ? tions suffered by their class for genera ? tions . But while the " Chevalier Gluck " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sly and had learned to temper his rudeness with the deference due to the great , until his rudeness itself added to his ce ? lebrity ; and while timid Jean-Jacques bowed and stammered and only when he was on his way down the stairs remem ? bered the proud speeches he might have made ? Beethoven launched his con ? tempt and insults openly in the crowded drawing-room . When Princess Lich ? nowsky 's mother , the Countess Thun , that magnificent woman who had been Gluck 's friend and Mozart 's protectress , knelt before him and begged him to play , Beethoven did not stir from his sofa , and refused . . . . " Put a beggar on horse ? back ? " Centuries were finding their revenge through him , and , as always , on the tenderest victims . What kindness that princely house of Lichnowsky showed him ! They adopted the uncouth young musician from Bonn and polished him , taking infinite pre ? cautions not to ruffle his suscepti ? bilities . The Princess gave him the love of a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put him under glass , to keep any unworthy breath from touching him . " Later we shall read the story of that evening at the Lichnowsky palace , in December 1806 , when his friends tried to save the " Fidelio , " which Beethoven , after its first failure , had refused to revise and was thinking of destroying . Seated at the piano , the Princess , who was already gravely ill , evoked the memory of his mother and besought him " not to let his greatest work perish . " But a few months after ? wards it needed only a , word , which scorned to him an encroachment on his independence , for Beethoven to shatter the bust of the Prince and leave the house , slamming the door behind him ; he was never to see the Lichnowskys again . Yet he loved them , and certain words of his later indicate that he was grateful to them ; but his gratitude entitled no one to any claims on his liberty . The scene , in fact , had been more violent than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to hush the matter up . An intimate letter from Ries to Wegeler , December 2.8 , 1837 , reveals what had happened : " If it had not been for Count Oppers ? dorf and a few others , we should have had an ugly brawl , for Beethoven had seized a chair and was about to smash it over Prince Lichnowsky 's head , the lat ? ter having broken down the door of the room where Beethoven had bolted him ? self in . Fortunately Oppersdorf threw himself between them . . . " The cause of the quarrel had been Beethoven 's refusal to play for some French officers who had been invited to dine at the Prince 's table . " Prince , " wrote Beethoven on leav ? ing , " you are what you are through the accident of birth ; I am what I am through myself . There are plenty of princes , and there will be thousands more in the future . There is only one Beethoven . " This arrogance bristled not only against members of another class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against the masters of his art , and against its rules . " The rules forbid such and such har ? monies . " " But I allow them . " Yet when Anton Halm brought him a sonata , in 1815 , and apologized for cer ? tain irregularities by saying that Beet ? hoven had often allowed himself to break the rules , Beethoven replied , " I can do it , you ca n't . " He refused to accept what was taught until he had tried it and tested it , sub ? mitting only to the direct lesson of ex ? perience . His two masters , Albrechts ? berger and Salieri , testified that he owed them nothing , for he had never beenwilling to admit what they told him ; hard , personal experience had taught him what he knew . He was the rebel ? lious archangel , of whom Gelinek said in dismay , " There is a Satan in that young man . " But patience ! The spear of Saint Michael was to release the hidden God . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept authority . In his time it seemed presumptuous of this young man to feel himself the equal of Goethe and Handel . But he was . If he was proud towards others , he was not towards himself . Speaking to Czerny of his defects and his imperfect education , he said , " And yet , I had a talent for music . .. . " No one has ever worked harder , or more patiently and perseveringly , from his first to his last days . The theorists whom he rejected at twenty , he was to take up again at forty , after the " Pas ? toral " and the " Symphony in C Minor , " read them , and make extracts from Kirnberger , Fux , Albreehtsberger , Turk , C. P. E. Bach . His intellectual curi ? osity , not only in music but in every field of thought , was prodigious . When he was about to die , he said , " I am be ? ginning to learn . " Patience ! The iron was already sep ? arating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had led him to com ? pete with virtuosos and dazzle the pub ? lic , was only a childhood eruption of the skin . When his friends talked to him later of his youthful celebrity , he replied : " Nonsense ! I never thought of writ ? ing for reputation and glory . What is in my heart has to come out ; that is why I write ! " All else was subordinated to the im ? perious voice of his inner life . Every true artist carries within him , though diffused and intermittent , that dream life that flows in vast sheets through the subterranean world . But in Beethoven it attained a unique degree of intensity , even before the closed doors of his hearing shut out the rest of the world . One has only to think of that magnificent " Largo e mesto in D Minor , " in the sonata op. 10 , no. 3 ? that sovereign meditation that overlooks the wide plain of life and its shadows . It was the work of a young man of twenty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a maturity of soul ! If he was less precocious , perhaps , than Mozart in the art of graceful expression , how much more mature was he in his inner life , in the knowledge and mastery of himself , his passions , and his dreams ! His strug ? gling childhood , with its premature ex ? periences , had developed these powers early in life . I see Beethoven , the boy , as the old baker , Gottfried Fischer , has recorded in his diary that he saw him in Bonn : sitting in his attic window , over ? looking the Rhine , his head in his hands , absorbed in " his fine , deep thoughts . " Perhaps that melodious lament , the poetic adagio of the first sonata for pi ? ano , was already singing in him . For he was haunted by melancholy while still a boy ; he tells us of it in the poignant letter that opens his correspondence : " Melancholy , which is almost as great an illness with me as disease itself . ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freeing himself from it by giving it form in the art of sounds . Whether the victor or the victim , how ? ever , he stood alone . From childhood , he had an extraordinary capacity for isolating himself wherever he might he , in the street or the drawing-room . When Mme. de Breuning saw him lost thus in space , unaware of what was go ? ing on about him , she used to say that he was having his " raptus . " Later this was to become an abyss where his spirit disappeared from the sight of men for hours and days . ' On such occasions it would have been dangerous to try to re ? call him . The somnambulist would not have forgiven you . Music develops , in its votaries , this power of concentration on an idea , a sort of European yoga , stamped with the Occidental traits of action and control ; for music is a moving architecture , all of whose parts must be grasped simul ? taneously . It demands a dizzying movement of the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a soaring flight over the whole field of dream . In no other musician has this effort of thought been more violent , more con ? tinuous , or more superhuman ? I would even say , more inhuman . Let us not overlook this ; for it contains the key to the enigma of Beethoven , his genius and , as I believe , his tragedy . Nature is not to be violated by the mind with impu ? nity . And when the mind wrings from it the secrets it has never yielded to any other it exacts payment . Whatever idea he grappled with , he did not release it until he had possessed it . Nothing could distract him from his pursuit . It was not accidental that his playing was marked with legato , unlike the dainty , staccato playing of Mozart and all the other pianists of his time . Each part was linked to the rest in Beethoven 's thought , though it seemed to jet forth in careless torrents . Ile mastered it , as he mastered himself . He appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? sions , but in reality no one could read to the bottom of his mind . During the first years of the century Seyfried , who observed him at dose range in society and at home , where they lived together , was less struck by the marks of emotion on his face than by his im ? passivity . " It was difficult , even impossible , to divine his approval or displeasure from his features " ( when he was listening to music ) ; " he was always the same , ap ? parently cold and contained in his judg ? ments . But within , his mind was work ? ing unceasingly . The animal envelope was like a marble without soul . " This is a Beethoven unsuspected by those that imagine him a sort of King Lear in the storm . But who really knew him ? Each spectator had to con ? tent himself with a snapshot . At thirty he had achieved a command ing equilibrium over the opposed ele ? ments in his thought . If , outside of art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in art with a steeled grip . For this reason he delighted in im ? provising , for then be wrestled with the surprises of his genius ; the subconscious forces were released and had to be sub ? dued . Many master musicians have been master improvisers , especially in the eighteenth century , when music , still preserving its suppleness , cultivated the quality of free invention . Yet this public of connoisseurs , who had just been spoiled by Mozart , admitted unanimous ? ly that no one equalled Beethoven in the unprecedented force of his improvisa ? tions . " Anyone who has never heard Beethoven improvise , " said the Baron de Tremont , " does not know the full depth and power of his genius . " It is difficult for us to form a concep ? tion of this , unless perhaps from the " Choral Fantasy , " which Mosehel ? s tells us he could not hear without be ? ing reminded of Beethoven improvising . Pianists as experienced as Ries and Czerny have described the inexhaustible richness of his playing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unexpected flights , the grap ? pling passions . These professionals , who were on their guard , were entranced like the rest . Whatever the company , said Czerny , it was impossible to resist ; the audience was overwhelmed . " Be ? sides the beauty and originality of the ideas , there was something extraordinary in their expression . " Aloys Schosser spoke of his " poetic fury . " . . . Like Prospero , Beethoven evoked spirits " from the depths to the heights . " His listeners sobbed , Reichardt wept openly . Not an eye was left dry . When he had finished and noticed their tears , he shrugged his shoulders , laughing contemptuously : " The idiots ! They are not artists . Artists are made of fire ; they do n't weep . " But this is another aspect of Beet ? hoven that is little known . His scornfor sentimentality has hardly been sus-pected . We have turned this oak into a weeping willow . It was his listeners who wept . For his part , he chose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to a friend when they were parting . " A man must be resolute and brave in everything . " Later we shall see him give Goethe a lesson in self-restraint . If he allowed the torments that rav ? aged his inner life to pass into his art , it was because he wished to do so . As artist , he remained their master , not to be swept away by them . He had been at their mercy ? Very well , his turn had come now . He held them in his power , he looked at them , and he laughed . In all of the above I have been describ ? ing Beethoven in 1800 , the genius at thirty . These are the powerful , wound ? ing traits that denote an abuse of force , but still force : an immense , inner sea , unaware of its limits . The risks , how ? ever , were great that it might lose itself in the sands of pride and success . Would the God he bore within him prove a Luci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on my tongue is not a literary image . In speaking of Beet ? hoven one is forced to speak of God : for him God was the first and most real of realities . We shall find him throughout all of Beethoven 's thought ; for Beetho ? ven could treat God as an equal or as a master . He could regard him as a com ? panion of his life , whom he bullied , or as a tyrant , whom he cursed ( " I have fre ? quently cursed the Creator , " he wrote to Wegeler in 1801 ) ; as a part of the Self , a stalwart friend , or a severe father , qui bene castigat ( the son of Johann van Beet ? hoven had tested the value of that method in childhood ) . But whoever it was that struggled with Beethoven , the struggle continued every hour of the day ; this God was a part of his household and lived with him ; he was never absent . Other friends disappeared ; he alone was always there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ques ? tions . There were always two voices in his inner speech . And you will find these dialogues of the soul everywhere in his music , from the earliest works : two souls in one , married and opposed , dis ? cussing , battling , their bodies laced to ? gether ? was it a struggle or an embrace ? One , however , was the voice of the mas ? ter ; there could be no mistake about that . As the year 1800 approached , Beet ? hoven was fighting against this God , and recognizing him . The contest was in ? cessantly renewed . Each time , the master printed his burning stamp in the soul , and waited for the conflagration . So far only the first flicker had been lighted by the gentle breath of Beetho ? ven 's theological friend , Amenda . But the flame and the stake were ready . Let the wind but come . . . It came . Until the period we are now entering Beethoven 's hearing had been excellent . He was proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sense which I possessed in its fullest perfection , as few other musicians had ever possessed it ! " The misfortune that overtook him be ? tween 1800 and 180 , like the storm in the " Pastoral " ? except that the fresh sky of the early period was never to re ? appear ? affected him in every part of his being at once : in his social life , in love , and in art . All were touched . First , his social life . For the Beetho ? ven of 1800 this was no trifle ! Consider the celebrity of an artist who , in five years , had given the world the first ten sonatas for piano ( and , among them , the " Pathetic " ) , the first five sonatas for piano and violin , and , in a cluster thrown at the feet o Prince Lohkowitz , the first two concertos for piano and orchestra , the " Septet " and the " Serenade " ! Yet I have mentioned only the most famous , works whose fire , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry and passion this young genius had poured into them : exquisite melody , humor , and fantasy , unleashed passions and brooding reveries ! A whole new world , as his contemporaries , and espe ? cially the younger men , felt at once . As Louis Schlosser said later , " The musical hero , whose genius , by releasing the infinite within us , founded a new era in art . " Moreover , these compositions for pianoforte and chamber orchestra ( for this tempestuous genius had had the rare patience not to undertake the con ? quest of the symphony in the grand style until he had subdued the entire do ? main of Kammermusik ) enjoyed an un ? paralleled popularity . Before thirty he had been recognized as the greatest of all composers for pianoforte , and in other fields as equalled only by Mozart and Haydn . From the beginning of the nineteenth century he was being played everywhere in Germany , Switzerland , Scotland , and Paris . At thirty be had already conquered the future . Let us picture this victorious Beetho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist , the lion of the drawing-rooms , who fascinated the young and stirred his listeners to ecstasy ; who de ? spised this elegant , sensitive , subtle so ? ciety but who craved it ? he had always lived in it since his early days as a boy Hofmusicus , emerging from his parents ' needy home , or , later , from his unkempt bachelor 's quarters in Vienna , to breathe the most aristocratic atmosphere in Europe and to feel its intoxication . A Beethoven whose uncouth manners had been patiently refined by Princess Lich ? nowsky ; who pretended to scorn fashion but carried his chin high over a beautiful white stock , cascading down in triple folds , while he glanced about him from the corner of his eye , proud and satisfied , yet a trifle uneasy , to surprise the effect on his audience . A Beethoven who danced ( and , alas , how clumsily ! ) ; a Beethoven who rode horseback ( un ? lucky horse ! ) ; a Beethoven whose good nature , full-throated laugh , gusto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ) found expression in ravishing music : the " Ritterhallet " at Bonn ( 1791 ) ; the " Serenade " ( 1796 ) ; the ex ? quisite Variations : " Vieni amora " ( 1791 ) , on a Russian dance ( 1795-7 ) , on an air of the " Molinaro " ( 1795 ) , bouncing Ger ? man dances ( 1795-97 ) , waltzes and Laendler enraptured with happy youth . . . Let no one imagine that he was un ? sociable ! Though he clashed with so ? ciety , he could not do without it . And from that we may measure what the loss of it must have cost him later on , For the moment he was enjoying it ; he was its favorite . But , child of the peo ? ple that he was , he knew that such favors were precarious and tinged with irony , sometimes kindly but often malicious . His countryman 's distrust warned him that his noble admirers watched for his blunders , his timidities , and signs of awkwardness . However truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one day to the next ! But he never humored them ; he humored no ? body , for it was an impossibility to his nature . He preferred to starve rather than mince the truth . To be sure , he had devoted Mcecenases , but he also had many more jealous enemies , virtuosos he had put out of countenance , embittered composers , fools he had shown up , and even young musicians he had made no effort to flatter . He was harsh with those who showed him their anaemic works . And he had no skill in gather ? ing worshipful disciples about him ; one or two professional pupils at the most . No one ever fitted less into the role of " dear Master . " He stood alone on the tightrope ; be ? neath him , the gaping crowd waited for a misstep . He had not been troubled by them so long as he had felt sure of the integrity of his body . Himself against all ! He had liked it that way , and played with the vertigo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate ? The tightrope walker struck with dizziness , what could he do ? Admit that he no longer saw clearly ? He clenched histeeth . As long as a flicker of light en ? tered his pupils he would go on . And the imminence of night exalted his creative fury . It exalted also love . Beethoven was possessed by love . The fire burned continuously , from ado ? lescence to his last days . One of his in ? timate friends remarked that " his heart was never free of passion . " Sensitive to beauty , he could not see a pretty face without becoming inflamed . To he sure , none of these flares lasted for long ; one extinguished another . He even boasted complacently that the longest had endured seven months ! But this was only the first zone of love . Above it were the sacred passions that left the " Wonne der Wehraut " in the soul ? a wound that bled unceasingly . . . There were mistresses , there were loves , and there was " the immortal Beloved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? tinguish between them . More than one of these little fires began in play and ended in a consuming blaze . But all degrees of love and passion were united in those first years of the century when deafness was about to im ? mure him . In the drawing-rooms of Vienna he was surrounded daily by clus ? ters of girls , many of whom were his pupils ( he never refused such pupils ! ) , and all of whom paid court to him ( I must insist on this fact which , at first thought , surprises one ) . He was the fashion : it was he who had written the new ballet , " Die GesehOpfe des Prome ? theus , " for Vigano and Casentini , to be given at the Court Theater , March 26th , 1801 . In all ages the performer , the artist in public view , has attracted women . But Beethoven exercised also a personal fas ? cination over them . Ugly and coarse as he seemed at first glance , he no sooner began to talk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic , or mocking , were subjugated . They discovered then that he had an elegant mouth , dazzling teeth , and " handsome , eloquent eyes which reflected every shade of his pro ? tean moods gracious , kindly , rude , angry , or threatening . " True , they laughed at him ; they were glad to dis ? cover foibles they could tease him about . These foibles supplied a protection with ? out which he would have been danger ? ous ; in the light duels of the heart they gave his opponents an advantage over him . For , of course , there was no ques ? tion , with these lovely , rich , titled young ladies , of pushing the adventure beyond a drawing-room flirtation . Let us not reproach them for that ! What is more surprising is that several were touched to the heart . In the letters published by La Mara and A. de Ilevesy , they speak frequently of Beethoven , " who is an angel . " Even while ridiculing him , their imaginations were often a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wake to chateaux in Hungary , where in gardens at evening he whispered , kissed , and made promises to be carried away by the first wind . . . . But we shall hear that wind , burning and terrible , in the presto agitato finale of the " Moonlight Sonata . " The years from 1799 to 1801 saw the budding of his intimacies with the two related families , Brunsvik and Guieci ? ardi . He loved the three cousins , Tesi ( Therese ) , Fepi ( Josephine ) , and Giuli ? etta ( twenty-five , twenty-one , and six ? teen years old ) , in turn and simulta ? neously . And his feeling was shared , as much as it could be by those little heads bubbling with youthful happiness , by the beautiful and flirtatious Giulietta , by the tender , proud , and fascinating Jo ? sephine ? the one who at that time loved him the most deeply ? and by the serious ( but not too serious ) Therese Brunsvik , who for so long wavered anxiously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion in Beethoven . Vet it was not to her that the letter " to he immortal Beloved " was to be written ! leven years later . But in November , 1801 , she was " a dear , enchanting girl " who bad captured Beethoven 's heart and by whom he thought himself loved . She alone dispelled the clouds of sadness and misanthropy gathering over him since he had been haunted by " the specter of deafness . " But , unhappily , she dispelled them only to let them fall again , heavier than before . Aware of his approaching misfor ? tune ? that terrible affliction he would soon be no longer able to conceal ? he longed to take refuge at a woman 's side . In his thoughts it was not merely a question of love now , but of marriage . " For the first time , " he wrote to Wege ? ler , " I feel that marriage might make me happy . " Until 1816 this was to be his constant hope and his constant disap ? pointment . Watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guide him . But who would extend it ? Not one of the women who alone attracted him . Aside from their pride of caste ( and if they had none , their families watched over this for them ) , what means of living had he to offer ? Before the first attacks of deafness he had lived without thought for the morrow . But his compositions brought him little , and he seldom ex ? acted pay for his lessons . He lived on uncertain benefactions , always some ? what wounding to his susceptibilities . To collect a nerst-egg he would have to tour Germany and other parts of Europe in recitals . He even considered this . " If it were not for my hearing , " he wrote , " I should already have covered half the earth . And I must do it . " But deafness was coming on so fast that the project already made him apprehensive . In any ease , it would take years to lay aside enough money . . . . Giulietta did not wait . She offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a musician ! ? a man of the world , an amateur , a handsome fellow , one of those dandies that play the role of great artist without any realiza ? tion of the gulf between their babblings and a work of genius . In the orchestra concerts of the winter of 1803 this little Count Gallenberg , a youngster of twenty , had the impudence to elbow Beethoven 's symphonies with his over ? tures copied from Mozart and Cheru ? bini . Nor did Giulietta recognize the difference any more than himself . Be ? tween Beethoven and Count Robert Gallenberg , she did not hesitate : it was Robert who was the fatal and misunder ? stood genius . She married him Novem ? ber 3rd , 1803 , a year and a half after Beethoven had dedicated the grievous " Sonata Quasi una Fantasia , " op. 27 , no. 2 ( the " Moonlight " ) , " alla Dami ? gella Contessa . " The illusion had riot lasted long : in the sonata there is already more grief and anger than love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ven wrote , in despair , the " Testament " of Heiligenstadt ( October 6 , 1802 ) . There are some biographers who like to lecture their heroes . And Beetho ? ven 's have not spared him . Through ? out the whole of the monumental work they have devoted to him , Thayer and his German successors have been anx ? ious to prove that , whatever Beetho ? ven 's misfortunes , aside from his deaf ? ness , they were well deserved ! It is true : he was guilty of not being able to adapt himself to ordinary standards . His biographers have shown an equal zeal in proving that , after all , he was not so unhappy ! Again it is true : this unhappy man nourished within him the immense joy of the Symphonies . But when they use his laughter to deny his anguish , his biographers lack not only a sense of greatness but of the most elementary traits of human nature . What treason history becomes in the hands of conscientious scholars who seek life in archives and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the patience of ants , these scholars have collected a treasure of documents , for which we can not sufficiently thank them . And , from time to time , like the good musicians they were , they warm toa splendid homage before the perfec ? tion of art . But how empty of life they are ! And what a sealed enigma life re ? mains to them ! Especially have they no suspicion of the proportions of their hero . They measure him with the com ? mon yardstick of all men . They are right , and they arc wrong ! Their yard ? stick gives them the right to conclude that the mountain is out of proportion . But the mountain , in turn , would have the right to accuse them of that " Geist der Kleinlichkeit " which Beethoven de ? spised and which he attributed , in irri ? tation , to one of his good friends . Beethoven would not be Beethoven if in all that he was there had not been an excess . I am not praising , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be able to embrace the ex ? tremes of his contrasts , which formed the natural balance of his powerful equi ? librium . Yes , Beethoven was capable , at least in his youth , of almost simul ? taneous grief and joy . One did not ex ? clude the other . They were the two poles of his " electrical genius , " as he himself called it . It was through them that his prodigious vitality was charged and discharged . His most extraordi ? nary trait was not his enormous capacity for suffering and love , but the elasticity of his nature . The crisis of 1802 is a magnificent example . Beethoven was stricken . Never did a more heart-breaking cry of despair come from the throat of a man than that testamentary letter ( which was never sent ) . He measured his length on the ground . But , like the Titan in the fable , it was only to leap up again with strength multiplied tenfold . " No , I will not endure it . . . . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me entire In such natures the excess of grief assures a healthy reaction . Strength grows with the enemy that assails it . And when the stricken man rose to his feet again , he was no longer a man alone : he was the army on the march of the " Eroica. "
