If a research worker for an industrial corporation conceives and patents a new device or process , the corporation usually gets it . But if a U. S. soldier designs a bullet or a U. S. sailor a boatswain 's whistle , it is his to sell to the Government . <P> This principle , formulated by the U. S. Supreme Court in 1870 when it ruled that the Army could not confiscate from Major Henry Hopkins Sibley his design for an Army tent , was upheld last week by Justice Wendell Holmes Stafford of the District of Columbia Supreme Court , who directed the Government to pay Rear-Admiral Bradley Allen Fiske , retired , $198,500 or $500 each for 397 naval airplanes now using a torpedo-discharging device originally Fiske-designed , Fiske-patented. * <P> In 1911 Admiral Fiske suggested that torpedoes be shot from airplanes , was ignored , went ahead on his own , a year later took out a patent . Though the British adopted a similar device during the War , Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels twice turned down the Fiske invention . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a U. S. Navy plane dropping a torpedo . Said he : " It was clear to me that the Government had deliberately taken my patent for its own use . " <P> In 1926 he sued . Rear-Admiral William Adger Moffett , as chief of the Naval Bureau of Aeronautics , was made the defendant . The Government claimed the invention because it had been perfected while the inventor was on active duty , because he had been educated at the U. S. Naval Academy at Government expense . Justice Stafford held that the Sibley case had closed to question the right of service men to take out patents . Hoping perhaps to overthrow the Sibley precedent as well as escape paying the Fiske damages , the Government prepared to appeal to the U. S. Supreme Court . <P> *Other Fiske inventions include the naval telescope sight , now in worldwide use , radio control for steering ships , submarine detecting apparatus , many others , most of which he sold to private concerns , which in turn sold them to the government .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
