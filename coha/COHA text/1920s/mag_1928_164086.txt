Briskly , and yet with due reverence , Crown Prince Umberto of Italy came unto Jerusalem last fortnight . The pilgrimage was made to top off an East African tour which His Royal Highness has just made through Italian Somaliland . Afric suns have burned him to a deep-toned brown . <P> Most inappropriately , the Most Catholic Crown Prince found in Jerusalem a gathering of potent Protestants . Lecturing and speechifying to one another , they constituted the International Missionary Council ( see RELIGION ) . <P> Honor was done to brown Umberto , however , by three personages : 1 ) British High Commissioner for Palestine Baron Plumer , who entertained him at Government House ; 2 ) Patriarch Monsignor Barlassina ( Roman Catholic ) , who donned a great purple robe and blessed Umberto ; 3 ) good Father Aurelio Marotta " Custodian of the Holy Land and Guardian of the Holy Sepulchre " ( Roman Catholic ) , who led His Royal Highness into the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and showed him an empty tomb .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
