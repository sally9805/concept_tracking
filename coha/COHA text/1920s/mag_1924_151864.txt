Preparations have been made for radiocasting from the War Department at Washington , at 10:30 P. M. on Sept. 12 , General Pershing 's speech of farewell , marking the closing minutes of his service in the Army and the celebration of Defense Day . The number of possible hearers will greatly contrast with the handful of officers and men who heard Washington 's farewell at Rocky Point , N. J. , almost a century and a half ago . <P> General Pershing 's rank and full pay will go from him . He now receives $13,500 in pay and $8,000 in allowances-$21,500 in all . After his retirement he will receive $10,125 in pay and no allowances . This is due to the failure of Congress to give him the rank and pay of a General for life . In Washington , there is some dissatisfaction with this failure of Congress , because General Pershing is well equipped physically to continue in active service ; and because , by contrast , George Dewey was made an Admiral of the Navy with full pay for life . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Staff , Major General John Leonard Hines will step up . But it will be a short step . General Hines is already Deputy Chief of Staff , and acts as the military head of the Army during General Pershing 's absences from Washington . His temporary job merely becomes permanent . Incidentally , the change will bring to the highest post in the Army a War-made officer , whose rise in rank was extremely rapid . In 1917 , General Hines was a major in the regular Army . He had been graduated almost 26 years earlier from West Point . His most prominent post had been as Adjutant General of the " Punitive Expedition " to Mexico in 1916 . <P> When he entered the War he went abroad on General Pershing 's staff . In the Fall of 1917 , he was made a temporary Colonel and given command of the 16th Infantry . Six months later he was made a Brigadier . Three months later he was given command of a division . Two months more found him a Corps Commander and a Major General . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1922 , General Hines has been Deputy Chief of Staff . He is now 56 years old , and has eight years to serve before he must be automatically retired on account of age . Secretary of War Weeks and President Coolidge agreed on him as the logical successor to General Pershing.
