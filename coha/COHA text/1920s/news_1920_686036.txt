txt Following the suggestion by Mayor Hylan of a scheme for meeting the $27 , - 000,000 deficiency in the appropriation for the Department of Education b4 voluntary reduction in expenditures by the Borough Presidents and heads of other , city departments , the Board of Aldermen yesterday passed without change the $345,571,399.77 city budget for 1921 , as received from the Board of Estimate . This is an increase of $71 , - 881,914.85 over the budget of 1920 , and is expected to result in a tax rate estimated at from 2.75 to 2.85 . The foregoing method of meeting the deficiency in the appropriation for the Department of Education , which requires more money this year because of ' Mandatory legislation increasing ' the salaries of teachers , was suggested by the Mayor in a letter to the. , Board of Aldermen after conferences with the other members of the Board of Estimate , except Controller Charles L. Craig and Henry H. Curran , Borough President of Manhattan , and after the Board of Education , through Anning Frail , its President , had agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount ' to be provided to $11,000,000 . Seven Per Cent . Reduction Necessary . The scheme was reported to have been suggested by F. H. LaGuardia , President of the Board ' of Aldermen , and to have been received by the Mayor as the best way of solving the difficulty with which the city was confronted . It was estimated that a 7 per cent . reduction in the expenditures of the five Borough Presidents ' offices and the city departments , added to four or five million dollars that the Mayor said he understood might be saved out of money appropriated this year for the redemption of special revenue bonds and tax notes , would be sufficient to meet the Educational Department deficit . All the Borough Presidents , except , Mr. Curran and the city department heads , over practiCally all of whom the Mayor has power of removal as well as appointment . were said to have agreed to practice economy and save whatever was possible . As the city charter empowers the Board of Aldermen to make reductions in the budget but prohibits ' it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this proposed 7 per cent . cut officially and add this amount to the appropriation for the Department of Education . The Mayor suggested that the Board of Aldermen permit the budget to stand as it was , with the , understanding that the reductions would be made by each city department and that the amounts thus saved would be transferred is they became , accruals to the Department of Educatibn , which would in that way obtain the money necessary to carry on the schools and pay the increased salaries of the teachers . Craig Calls It " numbug.7 Both Controller Craig and Mr. Curran expressed disbelief in the practicality of this schem4 Controller Craig called it " humbug , " and pointed out that the only real effect of the day 's proceedings was the adoption of the budget unchanged by the Board of Aldermen . " Once the Board of Aldermen lets go of the budget , there 's an end of it , " Controller Craig said . Asked if he did not believe that the Borough Presidents and heads of city departments would make these reducductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Borough Presidents and department heads are spenders , not savers . " " How can the city make up the Department of Educathin deficit , which now seems to be $25,000,000 ? " Mr. Craig was asked . " This deficit is more apparent than real , " he replied . " The Legilature attempted to take care of this situation by increasing the teacher 's quota for New York City , the amount paid by the State toward each teacher 's salary , from $100 and $200 to $800 , and added for that purpose 11/2 mills to the State tax rate . Now it seems there was a miscalculation and that the 11/2 mill will not produce the $600 quota and that the $600 quota Nras too small to meet the increase in salaries . ruts Solution Up to Legislature . ' But even with this $600 quota , the amount to be received by the city is only for the period ending June 30 next . If the Legislature continues this quota for the remainder of the year , the city will receive from this source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the apparent Department of Education deficit by that much . " This matter will be taken care of by the Legislature anyway , and those who are trying to devise some other method are only , getting in the way of orderly procedure . The present Governor , the incoming Governor and the Legislature are committed to the policy that educa- tion is a State function . By taking up the matter early in the session , the Legislature can settle it in time . " Mr. Curran was equally posed to the Hylan-LaGuardia method f meeting the Education Department deficit , but had a different remedy . " I think ' the scheme is all wrong , " he said . " Despite what the Mayor says , salaries would have to be cut ' to effect the saving needed . " The Mayor says this scheme is the only way to do it without legislation . The inue of revenue bonds does not require legislation , and that is probably what we will come to in the end . Revenue bonds for the required ' amount should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may know where it stands . Nobody knows how much the departments , can save , and under the scheme suggested the whole thing is up in the air . " Mayor 's Latter to Board . To carry out this scheme for filling the treasury of the Department of , Educa.tion by contributions from other city depdrtments , Mayor Hylan sent this formal request to the Board of Aldermen : Dec. 6 , 1920 . City of New York . Office of the . Mayor . $82,026,462.77 to $77.946,038.77 , a reduction of over $4,000,000 . Of this amount $50,270,960.83 is now provided for in the budget before you . The Board of Education this morning , every member being present , made further assurances of a reduction of at least e3,000,000 ; and perhaps more , to a point where it will not impair or inte  --  fere with the services and efficiency of the department . Such reduction by the Board of Education reduces the , deficit which the Board of Estimate and Apportionment Is endeavoring to make up by reduction in departments of. , the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of consideration has been given to the subject in ' order to meet - " the situation without passing on to future years the mandatory educational expenses of 1921 . When the State Legislature passed the mandatory legislation adding many millions of dollars to the school budget , which the city is compelled to provide , it was realized that such legislation would force the city budget for 1921 millions of dollars beyond the constitutional tax limit . It likewise provided for .. en amendment to the constitution , which if acted favorably upon by the next session of the Legislature and approved by the people at the next election , will exempt from the constitutional tax limit funds for the Board of Education . People Taxed to the Limit . Meetings have been held by members " of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment , the Board of Education and representatives of State educational authorities in an endeavor to find solne way of making up the deficit without placing a greater burden upon the- people of the city , who are already taxed to the limit . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been a united effort to co-operate and help in the , solution of this most pressing problem . Three different propositions were advanced : . ( 1 ) ' Obtain relief from the Legislature by the imposition of a State . to This simply means that the State would collect the tax one , New York City property which the taxpayers would find added to their 1922 . tax rate . ( 2 ) Another suggestion - would require the Board of Education-to come in with a request under Subdivision 8 of Section 877 of the State education law . This would ' immediately add between $22,000,000 and $28.000,000 to the 1922 budget , in addition to what the budget would , naturally be for that year . From the budgetary and financial viewpoint it has the same difficulties and disadvantages a : . the first proposition . Unless the State finds some other means of ' taxation the property owners of the city will be forced to pay the bill . The third suggestion presented was to reduce the activities of every department , and then turn over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtailment in the many city departments . This is copyright owner . Further reproduction the most businesslike but difficult plan . Fullest Co-operation Pledged . After conferring with the President of the Board of Aldermen , a confer once was held with the Presidents of the Boroughs of the Bronx , Brooklyn , Queens and Richmond , and department heads under my jurisdiction , at which conference the fullest co-operation was pledged for a further reduction where possible in their respective budgets . The thought will immediately occur to the Board of Aldermen that under the charter it is limited to reducing the budget and that under Section 226 of the charter the board may reduce the several amounts fixed by the Board of Estimate and Apportionment , except such amounts as are now or may hereafter be fixed by law , and except such amounts as may be inserted by the said Board of Estimate and Apportionment for the payment of State taxes and the payment of interest and principal of the city debt , but the Board of Aldermen may not increase such amounts nor vary the terms or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , way other tlekn by legislative enactment that any part of the deficit in the Department of Edueation can be made up if to transfer funds from other departments after the budget becomes effective in 1921 . If any items in the budget of the various departments be reduced re stricken out the amounts so save can not be used to reduce the defie. in the Board of Education . Reductions suggested should be left in the budget eo a transfer may be made from these departments to the Board of Education after the first of the year . I have been assured by the heads of departments and the Borough Presidents referred to that they will make the greatest possible reduction that can be made , which it is hoped will average a , 7 per cent . reduction in all departments . In addition to the proposed reduction above referred to , I am ' reliably informed , although it is impossible to secure the exact figures from the Finance Department of the city , . that probably $4,000,000 or $5,000,000 appropriated for the redemption of special revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be transferred to the Board of Education . ' I am opposed to reducing the salaries or wages of employes of the city to make up any deficits , and any reductions made must be other than personal services .

Minority Report for , Reduction . Although President LaGuardia , a Republican , urged compliance . with the Mayors request that no official reductions be made in the budget , most of the Republican members of the board supprohibited without permission . ported the report of the minority members of its Budget Committee , Aldermen August Ferand and William F. Quinn , who submitted a report which- recommended .. reductions which totaled on their face $7,553,030 . This report recommended " the reduction of the appropriation for the office of City Chamberlain from $2,055,063 to $1,000,000 , " with a statement that the office should be abolished and merged with the Finance Department . , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William T. Collins , Democratic leader , pointed out that there had been an error in printing the total of the proposed appropriation for the City Chamberlain 's office , which was in fact only $84.993 , and that the effect of ' this recommendation of the minority report , if it could be made effective , would be to increase the City Chamberlain 's appropriation by more than $900,000 . Alderman B. C. Vladeck , Socialist leader , put in a second minority report , recommending that the budget be sent back to the Board of Estimate without approval . Two-thirds of the budget appropriations will go for purposes which wilt en no way benefit directly the people of the city , " he said . " The rest will be administered by people whose views of public welfare are cleterfnined by class and political affiliations , and whose inefficiency has been proved to every student of municipal government .
