txt Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn will resign the presidency of Amherst College toMorrow . That decision , which is interpreted by his friends as a defeat for the ideals of liberal education , was reached late today . His resignation will be formally tendered to the trustees tomorrow and will be followed by a speech by Dr. Meiklejohn in which he will appeal for unity of thought and action in Amherst . The plan , as worked out by the trustees , is for him to take a year 's vacation , probably in Europe , and to return to the college as Professor of Logic and Metaphysics . The details of this plan are yet to be determined , but it has been settled that he will give up his chair of ethics . If Dr. Meiklejohn quits the Presidency . either by resignation or dismissal , a group of . the Younger faculty Members , men who have been brought to Amherst by him , will make known their belief that his going. is a blow at liberal academic thought . A group of eight professors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to make public a statement that the overthrow of the Meiklejohn regime is-a victory for the conservatives on the faculty . This younger group is headed by Walton H. Hamilton , professor of economics , a subject that has grown in importance during the Meiklejohn administration , and Albert Parker Fitch , professor of religious history . Friends Urge President to Fight . There is a possibility that Dr. MeikleIJohn will overturn the present plan at I j the last moment . He th , extremely ner1 vous and high-strung , and his friends who wish him to fight have been bringing to bear upon him all their powers of persuasion . He was closeted with a committee of the trustees for four hours today and met them ? again tonight . When he left the first meeting and went to the President 's house he met friends , one of them Cornelius J. Sullivan , a New York lawyer , whot are believed to have urged him not to yield to the Trustees . Although there was no doubt as to the decision taken this afternoon , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest crisis of ' his , career , Dr. Meiklejohn might decide to fight for what he still believes is a great ideal in education . But there is- a more unpleasant side to the picture , from which he undoubtedly shrinks . For if he defied the trustees and decided to fight removal he would be faced by the possibility that charges of maladministration and matters of a financial nature would be dragged into the open . The charges are such . as might be brought against any man whose attitude toward everyday affairs was not practical , but in a college President and leader of young men might be considered weaknesses . How the Faculty Friction Grew . There was apparently no friction in the Faculty when Dr. Meiklejohn came to Amherst . He was welcomed cordially ' and has been frank to say so . His I policies were apparently accepted , and I the older professors , somewhat againsttheir better judgment , changed their methods of teaching to conform to his idea of cultivating critical thought , even though they insisted upon the expression of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the younger men who came to teach at Amherst had not been personally antalistic to the older professor . One prominent alumnus who will have a ' hand in the decision affecting Dr. Mciklejohn 's future said that the young instructors arrived full of enthusiasm for their subjects and ready to trample on tradition associated with Amherst . ' They laughed at old things which Amherst men loved ? at the songs , at veneration for old customs . They regarded themselves as prophets of the new order . conducted themselves in classes with what the older men considered a lack of dignity= , stimulated freedom of thought and preached criticism of theories of social relations . There were constant disputes in Faculty meetings over these matters . Intellectual differences , became personal . The two groups got further and further apart , until there was no social contact between them . Each tacitly ignored the other in the community life , and the animosities became so bitter that even those alumni who had hoped to adjust the difficulties when they came to Amherst recently , including supporters of Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only solution was either the dismissal of one or the other group nr the removal of the President . Trustees ' Decision a Compromise . With the recognition of this condition , the conferences with President Meiklejohn took on the form of finding the best way out . Many solutions were considered , and the final decision vias taken as that which was easiest for the President and best for the college . That it did not meet the full approval of all those interested was evident . There were some of his supporters on the Faculty who felt that he should resign , that his usefulness was ended , and that the issue between liberalism and conservatism could be defined and settled after his departure . Others , outside the Faculty , felt that he should fight , despite all the pressure that could be brought to bear upon him . Great stress was laid today by one of his appointees . a professor who led in the development of the Meiklejohn theories of education , upon the interpretation which would be put upon the President 's resignation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was no doubt that the present trouble was the putcome of Dr. Meiklejohn 's liberal thought and liberal policies . Amherst , said this man , would ' be judged by educators on this issue and no other . He predicted that it would be extremely difficult for the trustees to get any one else of liberal views to accept the Presidency . Dr. Meiklejohn , in his speech after the trustees ' meeting tomorrow , is not expected to touch this phase of the sitution except lightly . He will say , according to plans approved tonight , that he has found that a majority of the Piculty are opposed to him and his teaching , and that he can not expect to impose his will upon this majority . Inasmuch as he has been considered somewhat ruthless in his attitude toward the Faculty , this declaration will be regarded as an extreme retreat from his former position . In this connection , it was said that a year ago 40 per cent . of the Faculty were opposed to him , 40 per cent , were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At present two-thirds of the Faculty are said to be opposed to him . If Dr. Meiklejohn resigns it is expected that the younger group of teachers brought to Amherst by him will also resign , or that their position may be made untenable . Each group has insisted that the elimination of the other was the cure of Amherst 's troubles . It became Known today that Dr. Meiklejohn was asked to resign by a representative of the Trustees two years ago , and that he refused absolutely . The opposition to him was not nearly as strong then among the Faculty and alumni as it is now . He has always been a fighter , and , although persons close to him felt that he would not have recourse to the courts if he were dismissed , they thought that he might ask some body like the Association of College Professors to examine the charges against him and . make known their judgment . In an article soon to be published in a magazine , : Dr. Meiklejohn discusses various phases of an educator 's responsibility and states his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who understand his work , and that outsiders can not be expected to appreciate the problems confronting him or the value of various educational theories . But if he resigns , it is expected that the ' entire dispute will be closed , so far as he is concerned . and that there will be no attempt on his part to justify his work . although he may look with sympathy on such a move by his friends and associates . There will be some such development . It is certain , for the controversy over liberalism in education will not die with Dr. Meiklejohn 's elimination if those who have worked with him can keep it alive . And it is also certain that Amherst will be represented as flaying subjected an advanced thinker to martyrdom because of opposition by a group of more conservative men . That is one of the eventualities which the trustees have faced with their eyes open , and it is expected that when their decision is announced they will aed:ompany it by a statement intended 1:o correct this r ession.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
