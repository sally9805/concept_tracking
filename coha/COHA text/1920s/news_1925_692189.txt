txt There have been so many lamentations over the piteous case of most European countries that it is a pleasure to read in The Quarterly Review an article on " The Pleasantness of Europeaa Life . " To be sure , the writer , Mr. ROBERT 13 . Moaner , is a Fellow of Corpus Christi College ; and it has seldom been hard to find one 's lot and heritage at Oxford agreeable . Mr. IslowAr takes a Scotch text to refute Bayer 's assertion that in the United States " the wretchedness of Europe is left behind . " That refers to an economic situation - which still exists , as the unsatisfied pressure of emigration shows . The writer seems to confound WASHINGTON with JEFEEEsoN , as most Americans do , in the matter of " entangling alliances . " He assumes that Americans have assumed ever since WASHINGTON 'S time " that " Europe was a poor sort of place , " worth visiting only because of its " heritage from - the past , its Old Mas " ters , its medieval churches , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nary inhabitant of Europe life le " supposed to be a burden . " Thus a myth has arisen , founded partly on the feeling of superiority in new countries and partly on the poverty of many European immigrants . Since the Old Masters have been rap , Idly emigrating , too , and Americans continue to swarm over Europe , perhaps it might be taken for granted that Americans appreciate the pleasantness of European life even more vividly than Europeans . What is the essential charm of Western Europe ? The infinite variety of things that have grown for centuries in their own way . The countryside has the aspects Of a multitude of finished landscapes . The- cities have their monuments of architecture , built in happier ages when the sense of beauty and honest craftsmanship were at their best . " Taste and style have never been lost . " That - is rather a sweeping affirmation , but let it go and forget the continual demolitions , " restorations , " piercing of new streets and howls of archaeologists and sentimental travelers . It is the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the inheritor of the classic tradition . Generations in some of which life was distinctly unpleasant have given a modern European , urban or rural , an often pleasant environment . Industrial civilization , on the other hand , has provided perhaps as much ugliness and uniformity as can be found in the United States . The aristocracy has disappeared as the governing class , according to Mr. Mower . It was not without representatives even in the Labor Government . Mr. BALD wix collared a number . The Liberals were always strong on Peers . We may grant that , to a large extent , the political governing class is bourgeois ; that Western Europe " is a place of moderate democracy and the frock coat . " Is the latter one of the pleasures of life ? If " the doctor , the lawyer , the " ' engineer , the professor and the " journalist  --  the highest vocations of " the normal bourgeois  --  are the basis " of Legislatures and Cabinets . " are n't these just the persons on whom taxation and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , is temporary . If he has an assured though modest livelihood the Western European , of whatever class , if . he has no strong material ambition , often has agreeable surroundings and amusements , a cheap and good theatre and- opera on the Continent , a charming country within easy reach , the daughters of the grape and the hop , forbidden by our wiser legislators . Especially in the small cities , outside of England , and in the cathedral towns there , life before the war seemed easy and enjoyable . The happy spots where so many foreigners lived well for little must now be few . It is the traveler and net the resident who gets the " variety . " The person condemned , as most persons are , to stay in one place Is apt to find his city as " uniform " and " Mc - notorious " as the gushing visitor is to find it " delightful , " and In all cities and countries the majority are working at the same old treadmill of routine . The pleasantness of European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its ancient and daily increas ? ing Inheritance of intellectual and " artistic resources . " Comes to Oxford scholars and their congeners . Not to most of the bourgeois , peasantry , proletariat and aristocracy .
