Not till weeks after Joe has been killed horribly in an accident , does Naomi realize to her joy that he lives on in the child she bears . But her joyless parents , stiff-necked with the sour self-righteous Protestantism of the ' 80s , snatch up the offer of " noble " Caleb to take Naomi and give her bastard a name . Naomi suffers untold husbandly violations from Caleb , but comforts herself that some day she will tell Brook , her daughter and Joe 's , of the beautiful passion by the gay brook for which the child was named . <P> She does so at an inopportune moment . Brook has been forbidden by Caleb to dance and love Tony , foreigner , Catholic . But Naomi , frantic lest Brook miss the great love she herself had known so fleetingly , tells Brook why she need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dutiful adolescent loyalty to this man who had treated her as his own , Brook escaped from Tony to Constantinople with a missionary friend of Caleb , and not till years later did she realize what her mother had wished for her . For luckily an English husband rescued her from the missionaries , and later a lover in Paris rescues her from her duty . That she is glad to be rescued , in spite of criticism , consummates at last her mother 's ideal of joyous living . Author Glaspell advocates this pagan ideal superfluously .
