A year ago the hack-writers who produce " true stories " and " confessions " were told by their employers to " lay off the sex stuff . " This applied chiefly to seductions and attempted seductions . A cleaner substitute was wanted , partly because of fear of censorship , but essentially because public taste was changing . Heart throbs , steadfast virtue , outdoor heroes , wholesome homes , human interest stories were selling like hotdogs at a horse race . They became the order of the day . <P> Take , for example , the True Story magazine , kingpin of Bernarr Macfadden 's confession group ( True Romances , True Experiences , Dream World ) . Boasting of " the largest newsstand sale in the world , " more than 2,000,000 a month , True Story sets the fashion in sex yarns . In May 1919 , its first issue appeared with some sober items about Elsie Ferguson , Billie Burke , William S. Hart , Douglas Fair banks . But the meat of the magazine was confession fiction . Of these stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A successful one was described as follows : " His kisses intoxicated me . Everything seemed to slip away . . . . " <P> In March 1925 , sex was in its heyday . <P> In March 1927 , when dilution began , True Story promised much , gave little . On its cover was a colored picture of a voluptuous-looking woman with hair down , shoulders bare except for a hint of negligee . The story titles included " The Price of Secret Love , " " The Treacherous Kiss , " " My Terrible Mistake , " " My Reckless Romance , " and even more urgent subtitles . But , though the number of thwarted seductions increased alarmingly , there were only two successful ones . This issue also contained a page bearing the legend : <P> Thinking Clergymen <P> Acclaim TRUE STORY <P> Crete , Neb. , Neosho , Mo. , Kalamazoo , Mich. , were the homes of some of these clergymen . <P> The March 1928 True Story , just out , is comparatively clean with such human interest stories as : " Thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glory , " " Wings of Love " ( aviators ) , " The Salvation of a Bank Burglar . " It has only four faintly off-color confessions . But the March True Experiences could almost be read at a Sunday school picnic . It has a wholesome girl on the cover , properly clad in a red dress with white collar ; an editorial by Mr. Macfadden entitled " Broaden Your Outlook . " Among the confessions are " The Girl of the Golden Heart , " " MatchMaking Mothers , " " When Loyalty Calls . " Attempted seductions : three . Successful seductions : none . <P> Bushy of hair , muscular of body ( which once was puny ) , Mr. Macfadden has long been proud of himself and his magazines . Recently he circulated among advertisers the information that last summer he made a speech in the British House of Commons and had dinner with a couple of lords .
