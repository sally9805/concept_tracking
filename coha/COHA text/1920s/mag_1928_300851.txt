" The fight against human excesses . . . is difficult . The fight against profiteering purveyors of alcohol is difficult . The fight against these two Powers combined is HOPELESS . " - Ivan Bratt . <P> The amount of liquor toped and swizzled in Sweden has been approximately halved during the past 15 years . Arrests for drunkenness have been halved . Crimes of violence have been reduced almost two-thirds . Swedes give the credit to Dr. Ivan Bratt . Yet he has just resigned as President of the Swedish Liquor &; Wine Trust : a unique corporation , doing business with the strange object of making as few sales as possible yet always paying to contented shareholders 7% . <P> Parents used to take sick children to Dr. Ivan Bratt , a young and smart child specialist , in 1909 . Some still do . However 1909 is pertinent because it was then that Swedish temperance societies polled 1,800,000 votes for absolute prohibition and only 20,000 for modified prohibition . That straw vote scared florid liquor barons white-and gave young Dr. Bratt a keen business idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shrewd , rich friends and buy out the scared liquor interests of Sweden for a song . The doctor 's wife , a Baroness in her own right , and other influential connections at Court and among politicians , facilitated Schemer Bratt by contriving to postpone the enactment of national prohibition , while his pool bought out the liquor barons cheap . <P> Within five years , and at a total cost of only 20,000,000 kroner ( $5,400,000 ) , the entire liquor business of Sweden had been acquired and monopolized under the Bratt System . <P> Though the Liquor &; Wine Trust ( Vins och Spritcentralen ) stands rock founded upon 7% , its other principles are more interesting . The return to shareholders can never be more than 7% . The surplus profits , amounting to 46% of sales last year , are turned over to the National Treasury , and usually constitute of the revenue of Sweden . Yet even these principles are not the most interesting . <P> The so-called Bratt System of liquor purveying is not " rationing , " as is often erroneously supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of buying a ration equal to his neighbor 's . A citizen upon whose police record appear charges of repeated drunkenness , crime , wife beating , or failure to support his children , can not buy liquor at all in the neat stores of the Swedish Monopoly . <P> To each customer a registered motbok ( passbook ) . Whenever and whatever he or she buys is recorded . A catalog of 800 wines and 250 liquors lists prime Scotch whiskey at $2.50 , sound French champagne at $2.75 and fiery Swedish brandy at 75 . <P> But not more than 13 gallons of hard liquor may be bought in any one year by even the most virtuous citizen . Less than 40% of the passbook holders ask for enough to fill their quotas . Single , self-supporting women were sternly held down by Dr. Bratt to an average of a gallon a year . Bachelors must attain the age of 23 before becoming eligible for a passbook . <P> Restrictions on the passbook sales of wines resemble those on liquor , but are lenient in proportion to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
