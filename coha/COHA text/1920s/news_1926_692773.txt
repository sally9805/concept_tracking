txt The case against far ! Carroll , on trial for perjury before Federal Judge Henry W. Goddard in the United States District Court , will probably be placed in the hands of the jury by noon today . Both sides summed up , yesterday afternoon , and Judge Goddard will begin his charge to the jury at 10:30 this morning . Interest centred last night upon whether Judge Goddard would charge that testimony with respect to the presence of a woman in a bathtub of liquid at Carroll 's after-theatre party Feb. 23 was material to the Volstead act investigation conducted by the Grand Juries before which Carroll is alleged to have testified falsely . Carrolltold two Grand Juries there was ' no woman or other person in a bathtub at his party . During his trial no attempt has been made to refute testimony that Joyce Hawley , a seventeenyear-old model , was In the tub . Numerous motions by Herbert C. I Smyth , Carroll 's trial counsel , to have stricken from the record all testimony relative to the woman in the tub on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grand Jury 's inquiry have been denied by Judge Goddard . Bitterness in Arguments . Some bitterness characterized the summing up by Mr. Smyth , and also by United States Attorney Emory R. Buckner . Mr. Smyth charged the Government with conducting the trial " under the disguise of a sex case , " whereas it was , he said , an attempt by a " pretty woman " to blackmail Carroll in order to " wreak her vengeance upon him . " He told the jury it should disregard the testimony of the presence of a woman in the bathtub , as the Grand Jury inquiry had been conducted solely under the Volstead act , and the bathtub scene was not material . His final statement , made , he said , " on the assumption that the worst the Government charges is true , " was that if Carroll had lied , he had " lied like a gentleman . " Mr. Buckner characterized his opponent 's summing up as the most " daring , brazen and desperate " he had ever heard . He said Mr. Smyth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench , to " impeach a Federal Judge , kick him down the stairs and take him out of the case . " He declared Carroll-had " spat upon the Bible and thrown it down four flights of stairs , " and had protected his bootlegger because he believed himself to be above the law . The prosecutor paid only brief attention to Mts ? . Hawley 's part in the case , making practically no reply to Mr. Smyth 's attack on her character . " Miss Hawley Is not mine , " he shouted to the jury . " I did n't put her in a bathtub . She 's Carroll 's . I brought her here because she is the woman he put in the tub : Any time that Earl Carroll pats a better woman in one of his bathtubs on the stage of his theatre , then I 'll bring a better woman to this courtroom . " James W. Cody , stage director at the Earl Carroll Theatre , to whom Joyce Hawley applied for , a  --  position in Carroll 's " Vanities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept a list of applicants who were qualified for employment in " Vanities " and a set of index cards about them . He produced his index card about Miss Hawley . This showed that she had given Joyce Hawley as her real name , 20 years as her age some months ago and Madison , Wis. , as her native town . In one corner of the card Mr. Cody had written , " D. D. " and also " 0 . K. Vanities . " What " D. D. " Meant . " And what does D. D. mean ? " asked Mr. Buckner . " That was a mental note I made of Miss Hawley . It means Dumb Dora . " " And yet you indexed her as qualified for a show girl in Vanities ? " " Yes , " said the witness . " The Dumb Dora referred ' to her lack of stage qualifications . She could neither sing nor dance . She was qualified , however , as a shove girl or a model . By D. D. I meant that I considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Miss Haviney 's index card was dated Nov. 27 , 1925 . It ? set forth that she had attended public school , high school and had been one ? year in a convent ; that her father was dead and that her nearest relative , a sister , lived at 5,849 Flournoy Street , Chicago . Mr. Cody said she seemed perfectly satisfied to work as a nude model at 530 a week . She was then living at the Fortyfourth Street Hotel . When the trial opened yesterday Carroll came into court with his wife , who was accompanied by a trained nurse . A dozen or more young women , members of Carroll 's " Vanities , " were in court . Later Judge Goddard suggested they be asked to retire as he thought they looked too young to hear the kind of testimony that might develop . The young women walked out smiling . Augustus Thomas , playwright , was the first witness called . He had just given his name when Mr. Smith , saying the jurors might not all know him by reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are . " " Well , " said . Mr. Thomas , " that is my right name . I am a member of several social clubs , Democratic clubs and anti-prohibition leagues . I have been a dramatist for fifty years and I think I have had more success than I deserve- " Carron 's Reputation Good . He said Caeroll had a good reputation and that the Lambs had found him quite satisfactory . Asked if the Lambs was a club of gentlemen , Mr. Thomas replied : " That is the understanding . " Edwin Farrell , assistant treasurer In Carroll 's box office , testified that Miss Hawley had several times tried to see Carroll after the bathtub party and had once said to Chris Scaife , an assistant amnager for Carroll . that she was then giving Carroll his " last chance . " That was when , it was alleged , she had asked for 51,000 for doing the bathtub scene and had later received a Grand Jury subpoena . David Schneider , box office treasurer at the Earl Carroll Theatre , testified that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can tell Mr. Carroll that I have another appointment and that he will be sorry . He will soon be seeking me . Tomorrow I will go before the Grand Jury . " Scaife said Miss Hawley had demanded $1,000 for her bathtub act , and had later asked for a contract with " Vanities . " He quoted her as having said she would make " plenty of trouble " for Carroll if he did not pay her , but would give any testimony he wanted if she received the 51,000 . Scaife said be had told her Carroll did not owe her anything . He added that she later consented to " testify to anything " for 8500 . He denied her testimony that he had offered her 5359 to " deny everything , " and also that he had given her intoxicants on the night of the party . Scaife said he was in charge of the bathtub , and had taken it upon himself to keep it filled for the guests , but that he went downstairs in another part of the theatre building to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub . He said he had poured nothing into the tub other than ginger ale , Al Jolson a Witness . Al Jolson testified he had no occupation , but had been an actor for twenty-five years . He considered Carroll " one of the finest men I ever knew . " and said he was proud to be a friend of the defendant . John J. McCabe , representing Canada Dry ginger ale , testified under crossexamination by Mr. Buckner that his concern paid Carroll for the privilege of serving free ginger ale to " Vanities " audiences , and that Carroll had used in that way 60,000 or 70,000 pints since last July . Reginald Barlow , an actor for fifty years , testified to Carroll 's reputation . Mr. Smyth summed up for an hour and a half . " The author of the prohibition law never had any idea in his wildest imaginings that it would be used to obtain a conviction based on a girl in a tub without clothing , yet that is the issue the Government has been stressing here . " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go outside anything over which the Government has jurisdiction . Mr. Buckner has often complained of the clogged wheels of justice , yet he has taken up a great deal of time and part of the 570.4100.000 a year he said it would require to enforce prohibition to try this kind of case . If liquor was not in the bathtub the incident was not material . The Grand Jury inquiry was under the national prohibition law . " There is nothing more charming than a pretty woman , yet how often pretty women without consciences will go any length to wreak their vengeance upon men . " Reviews Girl 's Testimony . Mr. Smyth then reviewed Miss Hawley 's testimony , said she had deliberately fooled Mr. Buckner and had given him not her own name but that of a younger sister , knowing he would send for the birth certificate of the person whose name she gave . He pointed out that she had admitted living alone in big Chicago hotels at the age of 14. and posing then as a model . " Her object here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impress you gentlemen with her need for sympathy and protection . Even the learned Judge admonished me at one time when she was on the stand and spoke of protecting a young girl , because he did not know what I knew . Sympathy ! Why , she is even now nightly , duplicating her bathtub act and making more money than she ever did before . " Mr. Buckner , before addressing the jury , caused a smile by drinking from a bottle of the ginger ale that he had offered in evidence . He described Carroll 's party as a " publicity stunt " for the benefit of Carroll and The Daily Mirror . In stressing his contention that the girl in the tub was material to the Grand Jury inquiry Mr. Buckner pointed out that Judge Goddard had denied all motions made by Mr. Smyth on that point . " It was a publicity stunt from the beginning , " declared Mr. Buckner . " This talk of Carroll protecting his guests is bunk . No guest violated the prohibition law . It is no ylolation for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Buckner , looking at Carroll , repeated the oath Carroll took before testifying before the Grand Juries . He then turned to the jury and said : " Carroll lied to protect his bootlegger . On two -- occasions he took this oath , then spat on the Bible and lied deliberately to protect commercial bootlegging . He did it because he thinks he is above the law . But he is not . No man can say I have treated cne person differently from another in my prosecutions or investigations upon complaints . For Mr. Smyth to say that Carroll lied like a gentleman is virtually a plea of guilty . " Gentlemen , as the Judge will instruct you , if you find that there was a woman in that bathtub , , whether it contained wine or ginger ale , you must convict the defendant of perjury . " This case has not ? so much to do with prohibition , but what is to become of God , of our Oaths , our courts and institutions if Carroll is to be permitted to boot the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and get away with it . " Since two of the six counts in Carroll 's ' indictment have been dismissed at the request of Mr. Buckner. he could be convicted only on four or fewer . Should he be convicted on four counts he could be sentenced to a maximum of twenty years in prison .
