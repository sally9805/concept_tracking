The Secretary of the Treasury was last week " resting , just resting " at Dinard , on the French coast . But he had a visitor , S. Parker Gilbert , Agent-General for Reparations . And after seeing Mr. Mellon , Agent Gilbert went to Paris , called on Premier Poincar of France . They talked , it was reported , about the long unratified Mellon-Berenger debt-settlement agreement ' . Through Agent Gilbert , Mr. Mellon explained that he wished this matter could be settled before the Mellon term at the Treasury is over ; that the U. S. Senate can not very well ratify until it has some notion that the French Parliament is well disposed . But Mr. Mellon got back no encouragement from M. Poincar . There was , he learned , no chance of ratification by the present French Parliament . Mr. Mellon continued to rest . For his part , M. Poincar hoped that the U. S. would wait patiently , in view of the fact that France has not waited for ratification to begin paying her debt on the scale fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : that the U. S. would insist upon collecting the $400,000,000 War stocks debt , due this month , which will be refunded with the rest of France 's debt to the U. S. as soon as the Mellon-Berenger agreement is ratified . The difference in annual payments is only the difference between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000 ( the Mellon-Berenger scale ) but to have to pay out $400,000,000 in a lump would boost the French budget by 20% . Mr. Mellon replied to M. Poincar that he could not , so near the end of his term , undertake the responsibility of waiving the $400,000,000 collection , which had come due through no fault of the U. S. but through France 's failure to ratify the refunding . Mr. Mellon continued to " rest . "
