txt No one can deny that the country is prospering without inflation . Periods of depression usually result from inflated inventories of the great industrial and mercantile institutions . There is nothing like this in evidence at present . Last annual reports of industrial companies found their inventories below normal . This applied to the consumer as well as producer . There has been little change in the policy of hand-to-mouth buying since the first of the year . In fact , some manufacturers say inventories on June 30 were probably less than they were on December 31 of last year . One proof of conservative buying is found in the unfilled business of U. S. ' Steel which , in relation to capacity , is about as low as it has been at any time in its history . The policy of most branches of industry to avoid inventory inflation is responsible for their very strong cash position . This in turn has made them less dependent on borrowed money , and is partly responsible for easier money rates . Many large and prosperous corporations , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be called upon to face a period of inactivity , but if the present policy of conservatism is adhered to , it will be an easy depression and not as lasting or demoralizing as some in the past that were brought about by business biting off more than it could properly digest . rnosPEnrric A banker says we shall have prosperity for years if we can keep most of our gold , keep President Coolidge in office and keep wages at a reasonable level . Newmont Mining in the outside market has made nj response to the advance in Texas Gulf Sulphur and Kennecott Copper , - perhaps because the Street is not familiar with the holdings of Newmont . Newmont owns over 80,000 shares each of Kennecott and Texas Gulf Sulphur and recent advances in these stocks add about $2 a share to the market value of Newmont . FM 'S PROM MISSOURI The following is from a Steel shareholder from La Belle , Missouri : " A middle western investor who holds 300 shares a U. S. Steel common , discussing Steel 's dividend policy , writes to The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Steel . directors are wealthy men and the return in dividends means very little to them . ' I am a middle western investor who has owned 1,250 shares of the common stock of the Steel Corporation at all times since May 7 , 1601 . I have felt at all times that I owned stock in the best managed corporation in the world . I think the way the Steel Corporation has been managed and handled is the greatest monument to the business industry in the United States . I feel that everyone who has had an interest in the corporation should be happy . Do n't lose sight of security for a few paltry dividends . I do n't lose any sleep over Steel common or the management . " STUDLatAICER Studebaker 's sales of cars in the second quarter of this year were 42,046 against 28,152 in the corresponding quarter of last year . This is a fine record , but would look even better to shareholders if there had been fewer sales of Studebaker shares on the Exchange . It is claimed the market has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last several months , which is the main reason for failure to move up in sympathy with other automobile stocks . Recently the stock has been stronger , which leads to hopes that the said 60,000 shares offered for sale have all been digested . Traffic on the western railroads in June was 107 , larger than in May and 11% in excess of last year . This is an even better barometer of business conditions throughout the country than chain store sales . TEE AIRICET Even the shorts have to admit that the market looks well . The reason it looks well is there is little public selling . A stock will go down as long as you keep on selling it , whether short or long stock . Long stock does not have to be bought back but short stock must be covered some time . This is the big difference . The recent declines have been due largely to short selling and the rallies due to covering , helped by a fair amount of public participation . Shareholders of the various corporations feel secure and it is because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raids . PROSPERXTV California is to raise $20,000,000 to rebuild Santa Barbara without outside aid . This is one great proof of the growing wealth of the country . Twenty years ago California ' would have been staggered by a loss of $20. - 000,000 and would be making appeals for funds to every state in the union . But the $20,000,000 is but a small part of the actual increase in wealth of that great state over the last twenty years . There are single banks in California that could carry the entire Santa Barbara burden without effort . A pleasing feature is that yellow newspapers will not be able to make capital out of the Santa Barbara disaster by soliciting funds solely for the advertising they get out it . Rails are under accumulation again and by insiders who know . Some heavy banking buying of stocks like Wabash , Missouri Pacific , ' Frisco and Katy has been going forward . Firms which specialize in rails have been quietly accumulating carrier shares for some six weeks and are expecting a sharp and sustained advance toward the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market have been wrong on things since the slump in prices earlier in the year . When prices were about at their low some of the largest operators in the Street made the prediction that industrial averages had seen their high for the year , while the railroad averages were bound to reach new highs . The industrial averages have made a number of new highs since then while the railroads have been doing nothing . InrII.LVS-OVERLAND Willys-Overland issues have absorbed considerable selling ' recently on account ' of the ' Stock ExChange failure , but the preferred continues to hold slightly above par ' and the common is still within striking distance of its high price for the year to date . Although talk of payment of the more than $30 a share in back dividends on the preferred has subsided , the earnings statement for the six months ended June 30 is expected to provide further stimulus to the issues .

EVA OPLIAN STEEL SUPRIFDI AC V Before the war Germany was supreme in steel production , having surpasded Great Britain . After the war Great Britain held the whip hand , with Germany second and France third . France has been gradually creeping up on Great Britain and the supremacy of the latter is again threatened . More so now if reports of a FrancoGerman steel pact are true . REA RD ON Tun STREET The hot summer months may bring perspiration but not necessarily liquidation . American Metal shares have been strong on better outlook for copper and prospects that the dividend will be raised from $3 to $4 annually .

Ten thousand sailed for Europe recently on 14 ships which means that payment of interest to the United States will be facilitated . Strength of such stocks as New York Central and Atchison gave tone to the market . Copper shares were strong on 14-cent metal . Oil shares were a shade firmer on the growing conviction that the oil situation is better than it has been in years .
