txt Senator Borah . Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , who has been one of the outstanding opponents of a policy which would make substantial concessions in terms for the settlement of the French war-time debt to the United States , made public today his reply to a letter received by him from Charles E. Piez , President of the Illinois Manufacturers Association , published in THE Nava Yona Thins this morning . Accepting the arguments by Mr. Piez in behalf of leniency as a suggestion that part at least of the burden of wiping out the debt be borne by the American taxpayers , Senator Borah replied that he did not feel he had the right to unload foreign debts upon tile American people , unless authorized by them to do so , and that he must stand forts . policy which called for the collection of the debt In full , with interest , " If it can be collected . " The French people , Senator Borah contended , were the most prosperous in Europe , and had the wealth to repay their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge military establishments and adopted a " sound fiscal policy such as New York bankers would approve . " The outcome of the controversy between Senator Borah and the President of the powerful industrial organization of the Middle West is being awaited here with deep interest , as there have been reports that many of the arguments presented by Mr. Piez in his letter have strong supporters In the financial and business world outside the Illinois organization . Comment on the letter was withheld today at the Treasury Department and by members of the American Debt Commission . No criticism , however , was voiced by officials closely associated With the debt negotiations , and this was of interest as it was reported here at the time of the Franco-American negotiations that Secretary Mellon and two or three of the other commissioners would have been willing to accept the last French offer of $6,220,000,000 if the other commissioners could have been won over to that viewpoint . Text of Borah 's Letter . Senator Borah 's letter follows : Oct. 26 , 1923 . Charles Piez , President Illinois Manufacturers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My dear Mr. Pies : Upon receipt of your letter I made formal acknowledgment of the same and stated that I would give your suggestions the study ' and reflection to which they were entitled . I have tone so , and I now desire to make some suggestions as to the French debt . You state in your letter that you have reason to believe that Secretary Mellon and M. Caillaux could . have reached a settlement had it not been that they feared the disapproval of the legislative bodies of their respective countries . It is evident . Mr. Piez , that you do not know Mr. Mellon . I venture to say that Mr. Mellon " would never be embarrassed in doing what he thought was the wise thing simply because somebody else might disap- prove it . If he thought he was doing the right thing and the wise thing , he would do ft and let responsibility for rejecting It be upon those who might See fit to do so . There is one feature of this subject to which , it seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we loaned France was secured from the American taxpayers Under the most specific pledge that the American taxpayers would be made secure : that these loans would be repaid with reasonable Interest . Men and women throughout this country were urged in every conceivable way , Often far beyond their means , to raise this money . Senators and Representatives , not only from the floor of the Senate , but from the public rostrum. ' pleaded with their constituents to buy every dollar of bonds they could possibly buy , and assuring them that it was simply a loan which our honorable allies would take care of when the war was over . I do not feel , as one who took part in this legislation , who took part in these public pledges , that I have any right to unload this foreign debt upon the people of this country unless they npthorize me , as their agent , to do so . Senators and Representatives undoubtedly feel that they are under the highest obligation which can rest upon a public servant to collect t'tis money if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the country up on the proposition of cancelling this debt , or any part of it , that is one thing . But I observed both our political parties In the last campaign made no such intimation . If your able letter had been sent to ' the Chairman of either of the political parties during the last election , you would have had in reply a scathing rebuke for thus unfeelingly Impugning the loyalty PS the taxpayer ' of the great political organization to which you might have addressed your letter . I regard myself in this matter as acting in no other capacity than a trustee to carry out a p/edge , and until those for whom I am acting indicate that I am released from that pledge , I would not feel like changing my course . You may think this is politics , but I think it is simply good faith in public service . France 's Ability to Pay . As to the ability of the French to pay , I wholly disagree with you . John D. Rockefeller Jr . could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in yachts and wines and Minting lodges . France has , since the war , maintained an active army of from 700.000 to 1,000,000 men , with a reserve army of 4,500,000 men . France hazy built more airplanes than Great Britain , the United States and Japan combined . She has now some 200,000 men fighting the Riffs and I see by the press dispatches day after day that the Syrians are made to feel , even under the beneficent rule of a mandate , the terrific weight of her military forces . She has loaned large sums of money to other Countries for the purpose of maintaining military establishments . When President Coolidge. anxious tot assist In lifting the crushing weight of armaments from the people throughout the world , suggested after the signing of the Locarno pact a disarmament conference , the French press almost universally condemned the proposal . There are no people , as a people , in Europe so prosperous as the French people . Her agricultural production last year was equal to that of 1913 ; her wine production was 000,000,000,000 gallons  --  larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . of 1913 production ; her iron was 130 per cent. ; her silk goods 117 per cent. ; metals trades 115 per ma per cent . She has no unemployed and the bal tr 11. : a. , .11 ) In her favor . I might go further with these facts and figures . But I contend that , France is able to pay under any sound fiscal policy . I do not feel under these circumstances it is any part of my duty to put the load of the present imperialistic wars and France 's military establishment upon the taxpayers of the United States . You say we can only get what France is willing to pay ; that we are not going to war to collect this debt . No , we are not going to war to collect this debt . If France wishes to repudiate her debt before the peoples of the world , that is her costly course if she chooses to take it . I But I do not conceive it to be any part Of the duty Of an American ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter you say : " The cancellation of the pre-armistice debt is out of the question . If for no other reason than that the habit of repudiating the debt is an Inducement for embarking upon future wars . " No more conclusive statement against the cancellation of this debt could be stated than this . I agree with you . Well , ( Vote cancel half of it , we have gone that far toward encouraging more wars and half-heartedly connived at the policy you condemn . And I do not myself see any difference as a matter of honor between repudiating a debt in its entirety and repudiating It in half . If I owe a man a hundred dollars and can pay him awl I refuse to pay him more than fifty dollars , I am a scoundrel , and I would have no standing whatever with the men of business honor who make up the Illinois Manufacturers ' Association . Since the war closed , private bankers in this Country have loaned to Governments , some of which are indebted to the United States , some $9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a much higher rate of interest than the Government is proposing to collect upon the principal due us . They are impatient , as we are advised , to make a large loan to Prance . If you shou1.1 address a letter to the bankers ' who floated these securities urging upon them the benefit which would accrue to them and their clients if they should reduce their interest by half and cancel the larger portion of the principal , my opinion is that their answer to you would be about the same answer I ought to make in behalf of the American taxpayers . Sacrifides for Taxpayers Only . I have never seen a suggestion from any eqtiree that the private bankers should cancel their Mani , or any part of them . I have ' heard of no letters to them showing that they are playing politics in trying to hold their debtors to their contracts , or that they and their clients would be benefited by surrendering their claims in whole or in part . These bankers undoubtedly feel  --  and they are among the ablest In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that these Governments can pay the loans any pay the intth  --  est . The only people who are asked to - make tremendous sacrifices in order to bring about proper economic adjustment Is the American . taxpayer who , under the appeal of his Government , loaned this money . The only cheap money for foreigners in the United States is the public money . If the private banker should be anxious to see that his clients collected their interest and their principal , he would be commended . But if thee representatives of the Government seem anxious to secure the re -- turn of the loan and the interest to the American taxpayer , which loan they induced him to make , they are regarded as playing politics . Mr. Plez. it ' seems to me that perhaps we differ because we appaoach this matter , and are compelled to approach it , from a different standpoint . I do not pretend to claim that under the policies which the Government of France has adopted end , seems insistent upon continuing since the war she can pay this debt , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound fiscal policy  --  such a fiscal policy , for instance , as the bankers of New York would approve  --  the people of France are able to pay this debt . They may wreck France financially . But if she is wrecked it will not be because of the debt she owes to the United " States . And if she is unable to pay it will not be because of her lack of weelth , but because of the improper use of the same . Very respectfully , W. E. BORAH.
