Newspaper readers occasionally encounter in the day 's news the following cryptogram : " etaoin shrdlu etaoin shrdlu etaoin shrdlu . " It is obviously some sort of typographical error , but what must have puzzled many an alert layman is the regularity of the error 's spelling . It always , somehow , turns into " etaoin shrdlu . " <P> Last week , noticing that the Literary Digest had reprinted an " etaoin shrdlu " line , apparently as a joke but without bothering to explain the mystery to its readers , the ever-practical New York World explained editorially for laymen what every newsman knows . <P> When a linotype operator makes an error he has to complete that line of type before he can make a new line . The easiest thing for him to do is to run his fingers down the first two vertical rows of his keyboard . The result is the emergence of a line containing " etaoin shrdlu . " And when the operator forgets to pluck the faulty line from the mould , " etaoin shrdlu " gets into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a " Mr. " prefixed , that Mr. Etaoin Shrdlu has really become a famed press personage . He has a relative who dwells on his right hand in the third vertical row on a linotype machine , young Mr. Cmfwyp . The family is completed by boyish Vbgkqj and tiny Xz , whose name trails off strangely into typographic symbols .
