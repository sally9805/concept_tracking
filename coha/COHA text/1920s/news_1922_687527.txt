txt Settlement of the anthracite . labor controversy rests with a committee of four operators and four miners appointed at the final session of the joint conference of 110 operators and miners yesterday . . The committee will im- ' mediately elect a chairman and-next week will undertake discussion of the miners ' 19 demands and the operators ' . position , which was explained at yesterday 's session . Neither side has made any statement indicating the expected outcome . Each is convinced of the correctness and justnes of the stand taken and intends to succeed in its ' defense . Samuel 0 : Warr:net. , chairman of the policies ' committee of the anthracite operators , presented the operators ' position . He said : " The object of this ' conference should be to construct a working ' agreement which will , in contrast with conditions in other coal fields , continue to afford a basis whereby the anthracite industry will provide fair wages , full time employment to its workers and a maximum production of coal at a cost which will enable it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to pay . " The operators are ready to consider and discuss any proposition relating to , wages and , working conditions , submitted by either party . , When it comes to matters affecting the cost of production there is another party to be considered , the buyer . Any adjustment which is not satisfactory to the buyer must inevitably fail ; for in that event production can not he distributed and the miner will then lose his opportunity for employment . The economic situation today not only forbids any increase in cost and prices but compels a reduction . Deflation in the cost of production , 70%. of which is represented by mine labor , is imperative . We can see . no alternative . Readjustment of the wage rates is the first necessary step to reduce the cost of anthracite to the consumer , and to insure continued stability in the industry . It is obvious then that prosperity and steady work in the anthracite fields must cease unless the price of anthracite coal can be reduced to a figure which the consumers can pay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miners.Wednesday in a general Way only . Discussion of the specific demands will take place next week at a meeting of the subcommittee consisting of four miners and four operators . The statement is a flat refusal to meet the demands drawn up at the Shamokin convention of the miners January 17 . Concessions may come from either side before the subcommittee meets but radical changes , leading to conciliation , are improbable since representatives of earls party in committee meeting will base its action on statements made Wednesday and Friday . Several operators have ordered production increased since Wednesday and will run mines at Maximum capacity until March 31 , since both are convinced a ' strike is inevitable . Mr. Warriner moved a committee of eight be appointed to undertake final settlement of the controversy . Johrc L. Lewis , president of the United Mine Wo ; . kers , agreed . The committee consists of vice presidents of three anthracite districts , the president or vice president of the United Mine ll'orkers , W. L. Connell , representing individual operators and president of the Green Ridge Coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warriner. president of ? the Lehigh Coal ' &; Navigation ' Co. ; W. W.
