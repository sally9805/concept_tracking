txt Automobile statistics must be irresistible to minds that revel in figures . Their volume is tremendous , and it changes almost from day to day . Looking into the future , a lightning calculator takes no risk of contradiction when he says that there will be 51,000,000 motor vehicles in the United States in 1975 , at which time he makes our population 171,600,000 . A Johns Hopkins mathematician is responsible for this speculation . The problem presents no difficulty to him , for he takes the present ratio of vehicles to population , studies the tables of increase in both in ten years and arrives at his conclusion without regarding a saturation point in sales or waste of life by war . It is different with the totals compiled by the Bureau of Industrial Technology relating to the present cost annually of motor vehicles to the American people . The bill is put at $14,293,000,000 , and it includes not only cars and trucks with accessories , hut repairs , depreciation , tires , " garaging , " gasoline , oil , drivers ' wages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cars and accessories is set down at $3,750,000,000 , while depreciation is figured at the large sum of $2,500,000,000 . As most owners drive their own pleasure cars , of which the number registered in 1924 was about ten times that of motor trucks , $1,600,000,000 seems to be an excessive total for drivers ' wages . The table , with more than fourteen billion dollars at its foot , is apparently one of liberal round numbers ; but it is a big subject . Any man 's imagination might take the bit between its teeth and run away . The estimated value of farm crops in 1924 was $12,404,000,000 , so it may be true , as this statistician asserts , that the automotive industry has become the greatest in the United States . The Department of Commerce is authority for the statement that on Jan. 1 there were 19,999,436 motor vehicles registered in the United States . Only 5,974,492 were allowed the rest of the world . The increase in this country was 3,278,000 over Jan. 1 , 1925 . New building construction is dwarfed in the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will not astonish the skilled workers on buildings : many of them own automobiles and can easily pay for- them out of wages . The Bureau of Industrial Technology says : One of the countless direct results of the great development of the automobile industry is the enormous road-building program now in progress in this country , calling for the expenditure of about $1,000,000,000 a. year . It is pointed out - that another resuit , even more impressive , is the extent of suburban construction which the automobile has made possible . In many American cities this neighborhood building on new streets stretching away for . miles exceeds strictly urban construction . The bureau feels warranted in describing the automobile as " probably the most important " factor , both from an economic and " social standpoint , in modern life . " Recently Colonel LEONARD P. AYRES , Vice President of the Cleveland Trust Company , said that but for the automobile most of the new homes in suburbs would not have been built . Almost every one of them has a garage on the lot . He added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbs ' had waited , as they must have in earlier years , for the building of new street-car lines , many of them would not have been developed . An interesting study would be the " financing " of the motor vehicle industry . It is perhaps the best proof that the credit of the country is built on firm foundations . Both the wholesale and the retail dealers have to borrow money from the banks to carry on their business . From 60 to 70 per cent . of the pleasure cars and 90 per cent . of the trucks and tractors are bought on the instalment plan ,
