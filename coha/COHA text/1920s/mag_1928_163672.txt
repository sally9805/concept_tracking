Against His Highness Prince Felix Youssoupov was brought at Paris , last week , a freak damage suit for $1,000,000 by Mme. Gregoriena Rasputin Solaviev , daughter of the late , detested " Black Monk , " Gregory Efimovich Rasputin , evil nemesis of the last Tsar and Tsarina of all the Russias . <P> The " damages " which would scarcely be recognized as such by public opinion , arise from the fact that Nemesis Rasputin was assassinated by gentlemen of the highest Russian aristocracy at the palace of Prince Felix Youssoupov in Petrograd , Dec. 15 , 1916 . Among Russians of the old regime Prince Youssoupov is honored as a deliverer and the assassination is invariably referred to as an execution .
