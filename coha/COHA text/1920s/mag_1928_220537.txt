With his heavy Scotch brows knit in a worried frown , James Ramsay MacDonald , onetime Prime Minister ( Jan. - Nov. 1924 ) , proposed , last week , legal protection for the British public against the mind-moulding power of the British newspaper trusts . " An alarming situation is developing ! " rapped Scot MacDonald , and many listened because he leads the second largest British parliamentary party : Labor . What had ruffled Laborite MacDonald , it shortly appeared , was the formation last week of a new news trust : " Northcliffe Newspapers , Ltd . " <P> Harold Sidney Harmsworth , Viscount Rothermere , brother and successor to the late famed Lord Northcliffe , heads the new group . He announced , last week , that it will exploit the news service of his Daily Mail and the picture service of his Daily Mirror by enlarging both to serve a to-be-founded chain of afternoon papers in Manchester , Birmingham , Bristol , Newcastle , Glasgow .

" <P> Inevitably the first result of such " experienced and powerful " throat-cutting between two major groups will be a slaughter of the independent provincial evening newspapers . It was this which James Ramsay MacDonald called , last week , " an alarming situation . " <P> Naturally observers sought for a " real reason " behind Laborite MacDonald 's righteous wrath . They found it in an editorial in the Laborite Daily Herald which observed : " The " greater portion of the readers of the evening papers are members of the working class , and if the Rothermere scheme is successful , the new papers will add to the copious stream of misrepresentation of the Labor movement which issues daily from the capitalist newspapers .
