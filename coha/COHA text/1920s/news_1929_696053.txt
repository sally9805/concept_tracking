txt The Money Crisis . To the Editor of The New York Tiwea : Your editorial of the : loth , " Crisis and Calm , " is very good . However . you could have been a trifle more positive in your comment . Mr. Charles E. Mitchell did not hide his light under a bushel . Those associated with him gave their consent , and , in reality . nominated him . to r.ct to save a crisis and demoralization whi0 was due in our financial markets last Tuesday morning . It wee a evenderful piece of work on the part of these gentlemen . Hundreds of People have congratulated 21r . Mitchell on  --  his stand and the open and fearless way in which he made it manifest , It is well for our country that we have men who feel the sense of responsibility and act to prevent the serious errors that arise through defective laws based on theories that , when*the actual conditions arise , never stand the acid test . The Federal Reserve Board refused to work at any price . Private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country at large ! Perhaps it might be as well for some of our politicians to realize this fact , and that loans and flotations of foreign securities and general business expansion on the American continent are the cause of our present . money embarrassment .

Witness the wholesale destruction growing worse every year of small chicks and rabbits at the Easter season . How many of these creatures are bought because they are " cute " in the dealer 's window , and then are left to perish through ignorance and neglect or because the novelty of owning them has worn off after the excitement of the season has passed and the routine of necessary care makes itself felt ? And even if good care is accorded them , the wretched and frightened Mlle creatures have been shifted about from one environment to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strange faces and pawing hands until the tax imposed upon their vitality proves too great and they succumb . Every one who has ever raised animals knows that the greatest care must be exercised in the treatment itewrd  --  d the young . Can not an appeal be mede the good sense and kindness of people ? LUC LE GREB ieNC . New York , March 30 , 1920 . State Enforcement . To the Editor of The New York 2'itices : Once again , despite contrary orders by their party leaders in the State , and a plain attempt at coercion by executive pressure from Washington , Republican Assemblymen have united with Democrats to defeat the Jenks State enforcement bill . Once again loyalty to the spirit of our Bill of Rights has withstood the shock of partisan fanaticism . The conduct of the Codes Committee in holding a " snap " meeting , shutting off debate and adopting in the first iestance a favorable report on the Jenks bill was so " shabby " that it helped to beat the measure it was designed to aid . AUSTEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Age and Its Difficulties . To the Editor of The Yew York Times : Perhaps Dr. Osier was not so far wrong after all . Some of the people who criticize him should follow the fortunes of a man approaching 60 years of age looking for employment . I would even approve of the city setting aside a chamber where old people might go quietly to sleep knowing their troubles were over . Give them twenty-four hours to consider and then help them to pass on . It is difficult to keep one 's self-respect while depending on some hard-working friend or relative for support . OVERAGE . New York , March 30 , 1929 . STOCK ISSUES AND LOANS . Not All Borrowed Money Is Used for Speculation . To the Editor of The New York Times : None of the articles bearing on the financial situation that I have read appears to take cognizance *of the real reason for the large increase in loans to brokers and financial houses . All these articles explain the increase by what is called excessive speculation on the part of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy new financing and consequent large volume of new securities still in the hands of the underwriters , necessitating large loans to these houses . That the loans to brokers and financial houses have increased several billions of dollars in the last few years is admitted . On the contrary , however , . commercial loans from bankers have decreased very considerably during the same period , when consideration is given the larger volume of business in the country today . ' Ten and fifteen years ago there were quite a large number of commercial paper houses ; now there are practically none . In the old days manufacturers and commercial firms were compelled to resort to banks and commercial paper houses to obtain funds for working capital , extensions and experimental work , because only a few such concerns had a sufficiently good record of earnings to enable them to sell securities . The position today is reversed ; nearly all such concerns have had a number of years of large earnings , and they can , and do , go into the market and sell stocks so that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of call money on the Street . Even new concerns , if they have fairly good prospects , can sell their securities for more money than they need for immediate development , and they also become lenders . Here is a subject for analysis by financial experts ; namely , to what extent are the large loans to brokers , caused by financing and refinancing of concerns which would formerly have been borrowers from banks or through commercial paper houses ? One of these days it will be recognized th Wall Street is doing a great work in financing business , in all its branches , in a better way than the old method of short-term loans . it may be that some way may be found or rule laid down by the Federal banks under which they will rediscount certain loans made to financial houses in place of rediscounting the vanishing commercial paper . This may seem chimerical , but new methods do replace old , at times . Recently the report of the president of one of our large manufacturing corporations stated : " The company deplores the diversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and credit as have been and are now being absorbed by ? the stock and security markets . " The inference . is that these vast sums of money are being used ? for speculative purposes only . An officer of a large manufacturing company has at his command many employes , to one of whom he can assign the task of making a thorough search of the daily financial pages and list the names and amounts of capital furnished through Wall Street channels to the business interests of the country during the last two years . The total would be a gigantic sum , which would represent Wall Street 's contribution to the needs of business . I think it fair to assume that no such total could have been furnished business concerns through the old channels of bank loans and sale of paper through commercial paper brokers in the same period of time . Let us admit that the public is in business to stay ; no longer are the stocks of corporations held by a few people , but by a great number , and a new financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reserve banks to solve . It is well known that in past years a great deal of money has been lost by small investors throughout the country through the buying of wildcat stocks and bonds put out by irresponsible houses . Is it not much better to encourage them to buy listed stocks , which have certainly some merit or they would not be listed on any of the exchanges ? ALLEN R. SMART . New York , March 29 , 1929 . Legal Technicalities . To the Editor of The New lurk Tiny-a : Some slight explanation may be had for the studied contempt shown by the average American citizen for the laws of his ry when one reads the decision just ! lauded down in the case of two men found guilty et bribery in connection with public work in the Borough of Queens . The Borough President testified that certain men had offered him $10,000 as a bribe to be lenient with certain sewer contractors when he was inducted into office . He was at the time Alderman , out had been elected Borough President . The trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - he evidence that the men were guilty . They were condemned to serve terms in the penitentiary . Now upon appeal a higher judge has decided that as he was then Alderman , although elected to the office of Borough President , it was impossible to bribe him to do anything in the future connected with his duties as Borough President ; that the charge could have held only it he had actually been inducted into office and was at the time of the alleged bribery attempt the Borough President . To the man on the street this looks ( Ike a bit of legal hair-splitting that tends to make our laws ridiculous . The jury having found the men guilty on the evidence , we are to assume that the offer of e10,000 actually had been made with the attempt to have the newly elected borough President betray the people when he would be in office . It does not appear to be common sense , and we are told that law is supposed to be common sense . to believe that a man who accepts money before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be if he took the money afterward . Similarly the men who were said to have tried to buy favors in advance of his induction into office should have been just as guilty of trying to bribe him as they would have been had they waited until he was installed . .

Buffet for his letter in Tam TIMES , " Solving the Stray Cat Problem . " A postal card sent to the A. S. P. C. A. at Twenty-sixth Street and Madison Avenue will bring the wagon and take away unwanted animals and destroy them painlessly .
