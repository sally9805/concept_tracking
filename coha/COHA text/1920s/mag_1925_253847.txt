On Apr. 5 , Premier Theunis resigned ( TIME , Apr. 27 ) . Since that date , M. imile Van der Velde , Count Charles de Broqueville , M. Aloys Van de Vyvere , Burgomaster Adolphe Max have ineffectually tried to form or maintain Cabinets ( TIME , May 25 et seq . ) . <P> Last week , Viscount Poullet , after ten days of negotiation , did what all Belgians declared impossible : he formed a Catholic-Socialist Government , dared to make the Socialist leader , imile Van der Velde his Foreign Minister . <P> Surprise in Belgium was quickly clouded by well-founded pessimism . Such a Cabinet would never command support from Parliament . Premier Poullet was wary . He did not lead his Cabinet into the Chamber of Deputies , as did his predecessors , and bluntly demand a vote of confidence . Instead , he put the onus of responsibility on the Catholic Party by asking its representatives in the Senate and Chamber if they were prepared to support his Government. * The Catholic Senators voted no confidence , 36 to 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 . <P> Premier Poullet handed his resignation to King Albert . <P> Once against the wisemen of Brussels said there was nothing for it but dissolution of Parliament and a new general election . <P> * No party has an absolute majority in either the Senate or Chamber and a coalition of two or all three ( Socialist , Catholic , Liberal ) of the groups is necessary .
