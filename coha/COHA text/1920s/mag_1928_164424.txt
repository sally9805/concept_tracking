Unheralded , unawaited , after a secret start from Berlin , the Bremen dropped from the sky above Dublin on March 26 . Three head-erect Germans stepped from her cabin : Baron Ehrenfried Gunther von Huenefeld , monocled Prussian nobleman , owner of the plane ; Capt . Hermann Koehl , stolid flyer from Berlin , proud possessor of a heroic war record ; Arthur Spindler , co-pilot and mechanic , who had been Capt . Koehl 's sergeant during the War . They announced themselves on the way to the U. S. , determined to be the first to make the hazardous wind-bucking passage East to West . <P> Day followed day . Impatient , fretful , the three Germans waited for clearing weather . There was nothing to do but pace the turf of Baldonnel Airdrome , inspecting and reinspecting their Junkers plane and its powerful Junkers engine . Talk in idleness led to argument . Baron von Huenefeld spoke a fiery word . Mechanic Spindler packed his bag , left , and then there were only two . No one dared ask the tight-lipped Prussian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily arranged and an Irishman climbed into the seat beside Pilot Koehl and the controls . Commandant James Fitzmaurice it was , and , as befitted an adventurous Irish lad of 30 with a flair for the romantic and a record for the daring , he was head of the Air Force of the Irish Free State . He too wanted to fly across the Atlantic ; had , indeed , made a start last September with Capt . Robert H. Mclntosh in the Fokker monoplane Princess Xenia , only to turn back after three hours ' weary bicker with the winds . <P> At 9 o'clock on the evening of April 11 , the two Germans and the Irishman were bending over maps and weather reports . Twice before that day the weather news had disappointed them . Also , word had come from Paris that Frenchmen were tuning up rival planes . The Germans decided , Fitzmaurice rushed from the room , burst into the Officers ' Mess at Baldonnel . " Crack goes the whip , off go the horses , and round go the wheels at 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the British Air Ministry said that almost ideal conditions might be expected as far as mid-Atlantic , though beyond lay possible danger . <P> The Irishman drank farewell toasts with his brothers of the Saorstat Corps . Said he : " Ten-thirty is my bedtime and I refuse to crawl in earlier just because there 's a little job of flying over the Atlantic to be done tomorrow . " It was midnight when he finally retired , in the room next to that of his eight-year-old daughter Pat , who , he said , " does n't give a hump about all this flying . " The Germans , strange figures in Ireland , plodded back to their quarters , the Baron to play a final game of solitaire , the phlegmatic Captain to make a final study of weather charts before turning in . <P> Long before 4 o'clock on the morning of the 12th , the roads to Baldonnel were burdened with men , women , children , donkeys , cycles , motorcars . The Bremen was trundled from her hangar and poised for flight , away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholics , made their confessions and Father O'Riordan blessed the plane . Baron von Huenefeld , doffing his yachting cap , hung a silken flag of the old German Empire beside that of the Irish Free State . President and Mrs. William T. Cosgrave , the German Consul-General , the Chief of Staff of the Army and other officials , watched .
