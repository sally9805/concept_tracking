Little things can annoy a great President . Last week President Hoover was thoroughly vexed by two occurrences : <P> 1 ) Into the Eastern food markets moved three carloads of particularly luscious apricots . Each crate was proudly proclaimed : " Grown and Packed on President Hoover 's Ranch , Wasco , Cal . " A pell-mell demand for Hoover apricots followed until the supply was exhausted . . . . Great was the President 's annoyance at this exploitation of his name and position . Careful explanations emanated officially from the White House : President Hoover does not own a Wasco Fruit Ranch . He does own some stock in Pozo Products Co. which in turn controls the ranch . The use of his name was " positively unauthorized , " " grossly misleading . " <P> 2 ) One morning last week President Hoover read this press headline : MARINES BUILDING CAMP FOR HOOVER . The accompanying story implied that the President had ordered the Marine guard of 40 men from the abandoned Mayflower to his Shenandoah National Park camp site to build his Lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akerson to the Press to make this announcement : " Every nail and every board in the President 's camp was paid for by Herbert Hoover out of his own pocket . . . . The roads to the camp were built by the State of Virginia . . . . The Marine detail is the usual presidential guard . ... Its only task is to keep its own quarters in condition . . . . " <P> To the White House last week went a Virginia delegation of Izaak Walton Leaguers , led by Congressman Robert Walton Moore . To the President they handed an expensive rod and reel , said it was " a token of esteem and gratitude for the impetus given outdoor sports , particularly fishing , which the President by hi ? example has brought to the attention of the whole country . " <P> The Hoover week-end outing : to the Shenandoah National Park Camp . Pastimes : building a dam across a creek to make a swimming pool ; pitching horseshoes . <P> Last week President Hoover scanned the 1931 Budget estimates . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs of government are continually mounting . Army , Navy , Postal Service and Public Works would cost $300,000,000 more than they had last year . The figures depressed the Hoover hope for tax reduction .
