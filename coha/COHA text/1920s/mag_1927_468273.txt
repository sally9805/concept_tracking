WHAT is the truth about instincts ? Do humans have them or do n't they ? The view most widely held to-day goes back to Darwin . Since man and the lower animals have had a common descent they must be a lot alike . We see the beaver , even at a youthful age , gnawing down trees and constructing a dam . We see young birds mated for the first time and without previous experience building a nest of the same material and according to the same general plan as their parents . We see young dogs six months of age swim when dropped into water for the first time as though they had had special training . We find young ducks and geese at home in the water after the first few minutes ; but young chicks , although they stay on top for a short time , soon become waterlogged and sink . There seems to be almost no limit to the number of examples of so-called instincts in animals lower than man . Now , since man has had an evolutionary history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instincts similar in many respects to those we find in animals . The a priori ground is strong . William James crystallized the whole thing for us . Looking over the behavior of adults and young children , he finally arrives at a list of human instincts . This is his list ? climbing , imitation , emulation , rivalry , pugnacity , anger , resentment , sympathy , hunting , fear , appropriation , acquisitiveness , kleptomania , constructiveness , play , curiosity , sociability , shyness , cleanliness , modesty , shame , love , jealousy , parental love . The notion that man has instincts similar to those of animals fits in with the Darwinian theory quite closely . It did not occur to Darwin and James that the actual facts could be different and at the same time offer no difficulties to the Darwinian theory of descent . To-day every biologist and every behaviorist believes in descent ? believes that man has had a long evolutionary history which started with the slime ? no one liberally educated to-day believes that man was a special creation . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possibly not yet clear ; but the admission of complete belief in descent does not commit us in any way on the subject of the inheritance which will belong to each new variant from the parent stock . Suppose our nearest phylogenetic ancestor were the monkey . Until the mutant man appeared no one could have predicted what his hereditary equipment would be like . Suppose the evolutionary process is still not complete ? suppose that through some chain of biological factors man should become once more a mutating stock and should suddenly throw a variant with wings . No one could predict what the birth equipment of this bird-man ( homoaxis ) would be like . No matter what his birth equipment should turn out to be , it would not alter the fact that he descended from man just as man has descended from some more primitive stock . Now , all this has bearing upon the instincts of the 1927 man . Just because he has had an evolutionary history is no proof that he must have instincts like the stock from which he sprang ? assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation upon the newborn infant and the continuation of these observations during the early years of childhood will enable us to decide whether man has more instincts than brutes , fewer instincts than brutes , or no instincts at all . Darwin and James had no real data upon which to base their conclusions . But this is not the whole story of the prevailing theory of instincts . Man not only has a body ? he has a " mind , " so the biologists assert . If his body has had an evolutionary history so also has his mind . We should expect to see , then , from this view " mental " traits in humans like those in animals . Our literature is shot through with such allusions . His mind has the " cunning of the brute " and the " slyness of a fox . " His mind is brutal , cruel , ferocious ? all such allusions show our mental kinship with the brute stock from which we sprang . And , furthermore , if we inherit many of our mental traits from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritance from our human fathers and grandfathers ? Reasoning thus by analogy , both biologists and laymen have built up a seemingly incontrovertible argument for the inheritance of so-called mental factors and potentialities , " His talent was inherited from his gifted father " ? " Ile is a statesman coming from a long line of statesmen " ? " His musical ability was inherited from his mother . " How often we hear it ! The inheritance of " disposition , " " talent , " " special abilities , " " mental alertness , " " temperament . " The belief in instincts and of inheritance of mental traits in man has been strengthened in the popular view by the propaganda of the eugenists . They have made many observations upon gifted families and they conclude from their findings that " talent " does run in families ? that such things as mathematical ability , musical ability , and artistic and literary ability are handeddown from parents to children . They go farther and hold out the hopes that by intermarriage of the gifted we can finally build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bred for art , industry , and science , and not for war . This belief of the eugenist will ultimately tamper with the mating of men and women and is more dangerous than bolshevism . Based upon the belief in the inheritance of family traits we have built up for ourselves ? we fortunate ones ( ? ) ? pretty world of F F V 's , my family , my ancestry , my Nordic blood , of superior and inferior races . We like to view the world through these rose-colored glasses if we happen to be allowed to wear them ? nor shallwe be especially grateful to the one who changes the color of our lenses . This belief in heredity of traits and capabilities has become a part of our mores ? ground into every generation by family and religious training . It is a device which enables us to shut our eyes to the present and to our responsibility for the present . It is a clever but tinverbalized device ( the Freudians would call it unconscious ) for living forever . It is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are dead all over , like Rover . Some of us may boast of the fact that we are irreligious and even claim that we do not believe in a life after death ? but we soothe the personal hurt of this by believing and teaching that we as individuals will carry on in our children just as our parents have carried on in us . Our traits , our emotional equipment , our vocational equipment , we believe , find expression in the lives of our children . We hate to give up . We hate to die . We ca n't believe there will ever come a time when our impress is lost to the world . Such an attitude finds full expression in a headline to an advertisement I once saw , " Why does every father hope that his firstborn will be a son ? " or in the law of primogeniture in European countries . This law is at heart partly a psychological law and does not depend wholly upon property and succession to title . Psychologically , it means that my firstborn will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am in full possession of all my perfections . Therefore , he , above all the children which I may beget in my later years when my powers may have waned , will be endowed with all my characteristic and perfected talents . Another thing this belief does for us ? if we have had children and failed with them , as most of us have , it provides us with an escape mechanism . If the " bad " child has inherited all these things from his mother 's family ( if the husband is seeking to clear his side of the family ) why should the husband be blamed ? It is just nature , and nature is so much stronger than nurture ! This , stripped of its unessentials , is the reason for our unbounded belief in the inheritance of " mental traits , " " dispositions , " " capabilities , " " tendencies , " and " special abilities . " H Now what are some of the unpleasant facts the behaviorist believes he has uncovered ? The behaviorist finds that the human being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ready to be shaped by any family in whose care it is first placed . This piece of protoplasm breathes , makes babbling , gurgling , cooing sounds with its vocal mechanisms , slaps its arms and legs about , moves its fingers and toes , cries , excretes through the skin and other organs the waste matter from its food . In short it squirms ( responds ) when the environment ( inside or out ) attacks it ( stimulates it ) . This is the solid observational rock upon which the behaviorist 's view is founded . He says , " I find none of the instincts listed by James . " The eugenist , the biologist , and the old-time psychologist say , " Yes , yes , but you have observed the child only for the first two or three years of infancy . Most of these instincts , all the traits andinherited talents and capabilities show up at a later age . " The behaviorist retorts , " Well , if I have observed them only for the first years of infancy , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have never observed them at all . Consequently the burden of proof rests upon you . You must at least go back to infancy to find out what the material is made up of that you are going later to observe . " And this is the whole point condi-tioning ? nurture not nature starts so early that the biologist and the eugenist have had no opportunity to make valid observations . The behaviorist can not doubt that the first two years of infancy are enormously important in shaping the child . If no record of the first two years of infancy has been kept , scientific observation is impossible . Every biologist knows how impossible it was to make accurate observations upon Burbank 's plant material ? it was all too mixed up ? too many things had been done to it which were not accurately recorded . Trying to observe a human child two years of age whose daily record was not kept is like trying to figure out the family history of a new variety of primrose by looking merely at the flower . By the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized ; his vocational slants , his character , his fears , his positive bent toward things ? toward pencil , paper , chalk , carpentry , water , social relations ? has been so slanted that only a divine being could unmake him and give him over to the biologist as new material fit to watch for the unfolding of So when the experimental evolutionist and the mental testers ? the latter are even predicting the future genius on the basis of the six-year-old test ? tell us that their studies of gifted families show that " gifts " are handed on to children in a greater percentage than the laws of chance would call for the behaviorist laughs . He sees in their claims only a perfect proof of his own theories . For where but in a musical family would the THE BEHAVIORIST LOOKS AT INSTINCTS 2.31 young infant get the pattern responses for becoming musical ? Where but in the family of the architect would the infant get those early slants that would make for architecture ; and where but in the family of the neurotic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have been coughing all day . I feel sick and I do n't think I ought to go to school to-day " ? Where but in the family of the artist would he get training in the handling of color , size , shape of objects , and the neurotic training that goes into the make-up of the artist ( the latter by no means a necessary part of his equipment ) ? But why are only some of the children of the gifted gifted ? The reasons are not far to seek . I often talk to artists about this . " My daughter who looks like me has a marvellous sense of rhythm and proportion ? she started early to show this . She really did good things when she was four . She even moves objects around the room in the same jerky way I do . I 've never tried to teach her anything . You ca n't make me believe she has n't inherited something ( ! ) of my gift and talent . My son who looks like his mother wo n't touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement like mine and yet they have grown up in the same environment . " It is unkind to tell this artist that he has a strong fixation on his daughter ? that almost from infancy he has found ( or better , built up ) in her what he has not found in his wife ; that his wife hates his profession and by hook and by crook will die before she will see the son follow in the footprints of her husband . Is there nothing then in heredity ? How absurd . Certainly there is . We are born men not kangaroos . We are born with two eyes situated close together , not like fowls and horses where the two eyes , except for a narrow range , never view the same object at the same time . We have two arms , two legs , ten fingers , and ten toes . Because of this structure there are some things we can more easily learn to do than otheranimals . Our fingers are more mobile than our toes . We learn to do things with fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are unlucky enough to be born without fingers we learn to write , pound a typewriter , and to draw with our toes . If we are unlucky enough to be born with only one arm we can never learn to be ambidextrous . If we are born without certain chemical constituents in our retinas we can never learn to react to monochromatic lights ( make responses to different colors ) . If we are born with certain deficiencies in our ears we may never react to different wave lengths in the air ( tone deaf , tone islands , etc . ) . If we are born without eyes we ca n't react visually . If we are born without certain brain equipment we may not be able to learn even the simple acts of caring for ourselves ( so-called defectives ) . The behaviorist admits all this but he says , contrasted with what the human infant has to learn ( be conditioned to ) , it is all unimportant . Take any newborn American youngster into the interior of China and give him over to the exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flawless Chinese , wear a queue , worship his ancestors , eat with chop sticks , sit on a mat . He will learn the Chinese scale of music ( very different from our own since they have a smaller number of notes than we have ) , develop very different rhythms and accents in music than we have in the West . What has become of his Western trait inheritances from his jazz-proficient pianoplaying mother and from his cubist modernist-in-art father ? Gone like the snows of yesteryear . His behavior , his capabilities , what he will do will be determined by his family life ? by the patterns he finds there , by the accidents of that environment , and by the special emotional fixation of the one or the other of his ( adopted ) parents . The behaviorist is a matter of fact , common sense kind of fellow . He asks us to come back to earth and the child as he is . On the basis of his experiments , he argues somewhat as follows : I find that I can take these squirmings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements of his arms , legs , feet , and toes , the squirm ings in his trunk and weave them into highly complicated acts of sport , of skill , such as driving a nail with a hammer , carving with a knife , shooting with bow and arrow or tennis playing , climbing , crawling , running , and walking . I can take the squirmings of the throat muscles and weave them into those highly organized acts we call talking and singing ( and , yes , even thinking ) . I can take the infantile squirmings of the gut ? the unstriped muscular tissue of the alimentary tract , diaphragm , heart , respiration , etc. ? and actually organize them into complicated emotional responses we call fears , loves , and rages . The behaviorist asks for nothing to start with in building a human being but the squirmings everyone can see in the newborn infant . He goes even farther and says , Give me just one hundred " squirmings " of fingers , hands , legs , toes , and trunk and let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than enough . And here he calls our attention to a very simple rule in arithmetic . How much is factorial 4 ? Why it is 4X5X2X1=24 . Now , since he can combine the 100 squirmings in as many ways as he pleases , the total number of such combinations of possible responses will be factorial 100 . Have you ever tried to work out factorial 100 ? Well , it is a colossal , stupendous number . If any human being possessed factorial 100 responses he would have so many that he could not run through his repertoire of responses if he lived to be as old as Methuselah . Take language for example ? you think you use almost a limitless number of words . As a matter of fact , few of us adults use more than 18,000 words . Most of us get along on less than e , 000 , many get along on 500 to 800 words . Society in America as we have it todaycalls upon us to possess such a simple set of adjustments . Our accomplishments , even our words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can pretty well predict what the majority of men and women are going to say and do in most situations . We are so stupidly uninteresting . We stop the organizing of these squirmings just as soon as we can get along in the group we live with ? just as soon as we can earn some kind of living in this land of milk and honey where a living is so pitifully easy to obtain . If the world were to be covered with water to a depth of six feet and all tools and lumber were cleared away , we should soon organize our latent squirmings into climbing , and from climbing to hopping and swinging from branch to branch in trees ( assuming that there were trees ) . Think how quickly our vocational and emotional equipment would change . There is no mystery in building the human being into as complicated an organism as he is ? the mystery is that we let him go on living with the simple set of responses he has when he has within him ( no miracle stuff ! ) such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrels with society . We let the individual stop at the 12 X 12 multiplication table . We let him get away with rotten tennis , unscientific and unsound business methods , with conversation at the level of a moron . There used to be a guild system where perfection of band and finger responses was called for , almost up to the physiological limit of the individual 's ability . Think of the tapestry that used to be woven , of the fine laces that used to be made , of the carvings that even the boys could make . And in the vocal field remember that once every troubadour was a virtuoso . This is not a cry for the good old days . It is not a wail that we have degenerated in eye , hand , and muscle . Not at all ? the stuff is there crying to be whipped into shape . It is a cry for getting some kind of shock or punishment in the environment which will force all of us to develop to the limit of our capabilities . I have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of protoplasm we call the human infant . Only in one field do we keep the guild spirit ? and that is in science . There Herculean tasks are done , and every generation sees finer and finer technic , greater and greater skill in the control of eye and hand . In short , the cry of the behaviorist is , " Give me the baby and my world to bring it up in and I 'll make it crawl and walk ? I 'll make it climb and use its hands in constructing buildings of stone or wood ? I 'll make it a thief , a gunman , or a dope fiend . The possibility of shaping in any direction is almost endless . Even gross differences in anatomical structure limit us far less than you may think . Take away man 's hands and I will make him write , use a typewriter , drive an automobile , paint and draw with his toes . Cut off his legs and paralyze his trunk muscles so that he will be bedridden but give me only his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violin , writing , and doing a thousand other things . Make him blind and he can still play ice hockey , shoot with some degree of skill , read and write , sculpture and earn his living in a thousand different ways . Rob him of his ears at birth and I can teach him to carry on a conversation with you by watching you speak . Make him a deaf-mute and I will still build you a Helen Keller . " With these facts before us we have the answer to the oft reiterated assertions of the eugenists ? that since measurements show that there are slight differences in body and brain structure between individuals these anatomical differences must make a difference in the way the newborn starts out . No , the burden of proof is on the other shoulder . In the light of what we know we can do with the human infant ( and undo and spoil ) at an early age , we are no longer willing to make accurate observations upon it . Heredity in the sense both of instincts and of inborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go until other facts are produced to substantiate it . Numerous weighty objections are raised against the behaviorist 's view that men are built , not born . The first is " here are two children born and brought up in the same environment ? by the same parents ? surrounded by the same neighbors . They eat the same food and dress in the same kind of clothes . Their capabilities , talents , dispositions , bents , and slants are totally different . How do you account for this ? There must be something in heredity after all . " Let us take an actual case : here are two brothers living in the same home , only a year or two different in age , born to parents sophisticated in child-nurture . Treated as nearly alike as possible , one gets tonsilit is , has numerous colds , has to stay in bed frequently , finally has to have his tonsils out and a birthmark removed . He goes to the hospital , sees the nurses in white , hears a man called " doctor . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and months the sight of a woman in white terrorizes him ; anyone called a doctor coming into the room raises a cry . Here are two little girls brought up in the same home with the same environment , one at the age of six receives a sex shock that conditions her towards boys and men for months and possibly for life . Fathers and mothers can not react to two children alike ; they can not treat the second child as they treat the firstborn . Identical twins , almost indistinguishable by sight or voice , come the nearest to having the same environment . Unless an accident such as an illness occurs to one and not the other , they will show closely similar behavior . But if the children are separated at an early age and brought up in widely different homes their organization is widely different . The same-environment - but - different traits objection breaks down because there is no such thing as same environment . Another argument often advanced as an annihilating one is that there is such a thing as an inferior race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which includes many biologists ) , " that the southern negro coming out of darkest Africa and falling under the influence of the cultured Southerner showed no rapid steps in the putting on of culture ? surely here the influence of heredity shows up . The negro is an inferior race and will always remain one . " Many of us now realize that this is a completely unproved statement . The negro has never been given a chance to develop . If you sent each and every negro to Harvard and then through law and medicine and gave him a year for travel and a million dollars a year income , he would still not have an equal chance . Even in Boston or in Washington the negro would still be a negro ? he would still be made to feel his inferiority . There is a sporadic attempt in New York on the part of a sophisticated group to lionize the negro ; they go to the Harlem night-clubs , eat and drink with him on a plane of social equality , ask him to their homes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negro try to marry a son or daughter of any member of this clique and the devil 's to pay . In Jamaica and on the Continent there is less of the social barrier , and the negro consequently has more nearly an equal chance with the white . Why , then , did n't he develop in Africa where he was king ? Because where food , sex , and shelter offer no problems there is nothing in the environment to force the trial and error movements that lead to discovery . Even white races dwelling in the tropics slow down . This argument is varied somewhat by certain biologists when they begin to argue for the difference in brain weight between the cultured European and the savage . The truth is that , regardless ofstatus of culture , brain weight is proportional to body weight . The savage has a small brain weight because he has a small body . The cultured European woman has about the same brain weight as the Australian bushman because on the average she has the same body weight . She has a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less " intelligence " than he has but because her body is smaller . Since the behaviorist does n't believe in instincts what does he put in their place ? How does he bring about organization in the simple squirmings of the infant . He does it by conditioning . Let us use some homely illustrations . One of the squirmings of the newborn brings its fingers to its mouth ( many youngsters suck their fingers almost from the moment of birth ) . Rap his fingers with a pencil each time he puts his finger in his mouth , soon the mere sight of the moving pencil makes him draw back his hand ; a little later the mere sight of the individual who always raps him will cause him to pull his finger from his mouth . This modification of behavior we call a conditioned visual response . The sight of the pencil or the sight of the experimenter 's face at first called out no response ? were not stimuli . By this simple procedure we have made the mere sight of the pencil and the mere sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hitting him with the pencil . Take the child 's breathing ? surely this is an unchanging , steady , physiological reflex ? Not at all . Show the infant a red apple , it does not affect his breathing . How can I make the apple profoundly modify his breathing ? A slap on the wrist from birth does cause a marked variation in breathing . Now if I show the red apple at the instant I slap him on the wrist , the red apple soon causes the same change in the rhythm of breathing as does the slap on the wrist . Again we have built up a conditioned visual response . A visual object that had no kick has been provided with one . Every object in the universe thus becomes loaded or charged , as it were , by conditioning . Without going into detail we can say , by stretching our imagination a bit , that we can take any object in the universe ( including words ) and make the infant flex his arm at the elbow every time that object is shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him clench his fist every time he sees it . By showing the objects serially ( spacing and timing ) we cause the child to display his responses in series . We call this an " act . " Think of a soldier under command ? " Hurrumph ? present arms , hurrumph ? shoulder arms , forward march "  - -  each step in this act is a conditioned response built in just like the ones we build in the infant to enable it to manipulate its milk bottle , toys , etc . This conditioning goes on rapidly from the moment of birth . Conditioned he becomes almost at once to the bottle , to the mother 's voice and footstep , the harsher touch of the father and to his louder voice , to the way he is dressed and laid in his cradle , to the light in his room . Condition a nine-months-old baby by letting him have a toy to take to bed ? neglect to hand this to him some night , and you 'll hear from him . Condition him to sleeping with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let someone besides his mother hold and feed and dress him and you 'll see how the cement is beginning to set . By the end of a year he is almost adamant along the lines in which you have conditioned him . With me my four-year-old is a boat builder and an athlete ? proudly displaying his muscle , his chest , and his ability to box ; with the gardener a gardener ; with his mother an automobile driver , a reader of books ; with his nurse a chatterer of French ; with his six-year-old bicycle-riding brother he is a kiddy-car expert . If you have n't had experience with conditioning infants it is difficult to realize how quickly the protoplasmic material gets fixed . Now is n't all this far better and more thrilling than instincts ? Is the behaviorist going to tear down the world by finding that , instead of instincts in the child which are irrevocable and beyond our control , he has limitless plasticity at the start ? Does n't it give every parent ? every potential parent ? a kind of open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not have to carry along many of the weaknesses and inferiorities he possesses ? Does n't it give every man and woman who has failed and who has attributed that failure to faulty inheritance or " fundamental constitution " a thought that possibly his or her own efforts have in the past not been quite vigorous enough ? And does n't it make all of us responsible in a way for failures in society ? for our criminals , our drug fiends , and for the ignorance and stupidity of the masses ? The behaviorist is a mechanist ? Yes , utterly , but is not one piece of iron shaped to become an automobile axle , another to become the essential parts of a scientific instrument ; is n't one piece of rubber shaped into a tire , another into a tube ; and is n't it man 's hands that do the shaping ? Is there anything especially revolting in believing that man 's hands can take the living protoplasmic mass we call the child and shape it according to the specifications demanded by our present social standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only hopeless and downright dangerous mechanists are the predestinarians and propagandists for the inheritance through endless ages of " mental traits .
