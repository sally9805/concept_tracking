ONE of the most entertaining announcements of the week comes from the League of Girls Clubs . They are to hold a series of lectures on " Have We a National Art ? " A more " woman 's club " subject , it would he difficult to find and the fact that they have got Professor Baker , Forbes Watson , and Carl Sand-burg to come and discuss this great question leads to the conclusion that at least three intellectual men in the world are earning money . WE have noted the disappointment of President Coolidge over the breakdown of the Coal Conference . A more generous community than New York would have granted him some privilege in recognition of his effort to settle the difficulty . The freedom of Gramercy Park would not have been too great an honor , for instance . THE Anti-Saloon League an- nounces that during the next few months it is going to insist upon all citizens adopting a showdown policy on the question of Prohibition . Wilting as ever to take the lead , THE NEW YORKER announces that pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single complaint about the liquor situation this year . FOLLOWING the tradition of American Women Tennis Champions , Miss Wills is now in Europe to prove that Lenglen is not the best player in the world . Already the sports writers are saying that the French Champion wo n't play , is too ill to play , is afraid to play . They do this so that when Miss Wills gets beaten the Great American Publicwill he certain that Lenglen cheated somehow . ALTHOUGH still handicapped with the Bostonian legend , Har-vard , every once in a while , comes out with something that shows how valuable it is to he three hundred years old and self-assured . It announces that seniors need not attend classes . Among those college men with whom it is worth bothering at all , the move will arouse a feeling of self respect and a new impulse to learn . In professional circles will reappear the necessity of making lectures worth listening to . For all we know , America may yet have an institution of learning which will not have to lean almost entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging to those of us who are trying to bring the Public Lirary up to date on the question of smoking to find that those in charge of the catalogue are not dead to modern art . Under the head of Fine Arts they list , Auction Bridge Under the New Count , How to Write a Moving Picture Play , and How to Play Mal : - long . IT is only fair to Mr. Kahn and his peers in the Metropolitan to believe their statement that they will do with the Opera whatever the majority of music-lovers want , regardless of the exigencies of finance . There is no provocation whatever to be cynical  --  save to bear in mind that in matters connected with art , the opinion of the majority is worth , at the outside , thirty cents . Opera as it appears in the Metropolitan today is a delightful pastime to a comparatively few thousands ; as a musical effort it is an unholy bore to millions . We observed Mr. Kahn on the steps in Carnegie Hall recently watching the extraordinary people who thronged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we still presume , that he was trying to figure out why that audience was alive and why , since the war , the audience in his Opera House has been by comparison half dead . So astute a man as he can not miss the fact that the sun of German Opera is fast westering . Perhaps in its decline it is dragging with it the notion that a show must be important if it is held in a big enough building , perhaps the movie palaces and their pictures now , to a large extent , are satisfying the American craving for the out-size in things ; at any rate we know that something is happening which is making the Opera House look musty and filling the sensitive musician with a distaste for its principles . The sister arts are busy . Little theatres are cropping up ; artists are painting little pictures . It is a sign worth noting . If the opera managers should at heart want to perpetuate a social spectacle , let them build a more elegant and a bigger Opera House than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Plaza hotel . Then if Mr. Kahn is anxious to please the music-lovers , let him build two or more small houses where Opera may be played . We think in that case he will not be bothered with the professional clappers who now make his galleries wonderfully noisy and fill the scattering of music lovers in his diamond horseshoe with distaste . The Week MME . WALSKA , in Paris , will make another- attempt in " Madame Butterfly " , and local society is said to be contemplating bestowing its favor on comic opera . Senate discussion of war debts centers about Italy 's ability to pay and Dowager Queen Margharita 's will bequeaths to her son , King Victor , two hundred and twenty yards of pearl ropes . Two tons of records about vice are returned by Mr. Enright to the new Police Commissioner and the National Surety Company announces that it has cancelled all burglary risks . Senator Couzens charges the Government 's laxity has lost it $308,000,000 in corporation taxes and New York State increases the maximum allowance for employes disabled in industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken for official records and Rupert Hughes draws ire of patriotic societies by asserting that George Washington was a distiller . Freak winter balmy weather in Alaska and , conference breaking up , coal strike continues . Pastor denounces the Charleston as immodest and program for Yale Prom Week is announced . Mr. Zero feeds five hundred men in one day at five cents a meal and eighteen Sevres soup plates , from the Late Senator Clark 's collection , are sold for five thousand dollars . Red-Golden Haze THE Gentleman who has grown a few years older taxied away from the Junior League 's Red and Gold Ball in a haze of mild bewilderwent , to which alcohol had contributed not at all . It was easily the season 's , and perhaps the decade 's , most decorous party . The Gentleman 's befuddlement was due to his observance of what was to him a most striking phenomena  --  in proportion of at least three to one , the ladies he had seen at the affair wore their hair coifed . Shingles and bobs were very much in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a colorful bail , and the cabaret feature of the evening was not marred by the more glaring amateur-isms which frequently attend such attempts . For one thing , the entertainment was brief ; and it moved with fine rapidity . The flow of successive lines of charming ladies  --  gorgeously gowned in red and with gold wigs  --  would have aroused even Mr. Ziegfeld 's envy as it poured down the steps from the stage onto the rectangular floor . Rather reluctantly , since his points are somewhat stiffer , the Gentleman who has grown a few years older admits that the Charleston is still on the crest . The most spontaneous incident of the evening was the impromptu participation of various young ladies in the gentlemen 's Charleston contest . They had had no choice but to sit , nervously twitching , through the girl 's event , which preceeded , since it was limited to twelve chosen members of the League . But who remembers , the Aging Gentleman inquiries a bit petulantly , the names of the winners of the Tango contest of 1915 or there-abouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner jacket . It seems to be on the defensive . Another season or so and everything will be back to the fretting tailcoat . Error REUBEN 'S , the only delicatessen store in town that we know of with a coat check room , has been popu-larizing itself recently by sending tele-grams of congratulation to cast mem-bers on first nights . Everybody from the star to the assistant usher gets one ? and they must all be different  --  a state of affairs in no way add-ing to the reposeful calm of the proprietor . Some times , however , the unsolicited assistance of telegraph operators results in an unconscious masterpiece , as in the case of the other night when a star , who , let us add , lacks some of the finer feelings for a joke , gathered a bevy of admirers about her table and read as follows , Stuyvesant , the demon balloon smasher " May you repeat your glorious excesses of the past stop Reubens that 's all . " The critics said she overplayed the quarrel scene . Art is Queer PEOPLE who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculptor , who is not far sighted , often asks them to " just look out of the window and see what that tower clock says . " His watch is chronically out of repair . Well just the other day at tea , as we were in the act of wondering what use to the world might be the ten cent spy glasses which Mr. Woolworth has lately been displaying in his stores , the same John Gregory pulled one of the things out of his pocket . " Look , " he said proudly , " It cost a dime but it saved me ninety cents . I can see that clock out of my window now and wo n't have to huy another watch . " Highest Paid MR . MAXFIELD PARRISH after going sixty years without once giving an exhibition , sends down from New Hampshire a scant dozen canvases and receives a check in six figures . Not a great many people saw the recent exhibit at Scott &; Fowles , but the few that did were in the buying mood . If , as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture , Mr. Parrish is the highest paid artist living . Valesqucz in his prime never received any such sum . Just what prices were paid , however , is apparently not known to anyone but the artist and his agents . The lowest figure we have heard is $150,000 for the whole catalogue . While the buying was in progress , Mr. - Parrish was in Cornish , New Hampshire , where he first went , years ago , when St. Gaudens was alive  --  he and Winston Churchill and others . They say he has n't left his house on the hill , overlooking the valley , in ten years excepting to go to Windsor across the Connecticut River . Presumedly he was making furniture on his turning lathe  --  tables with large bulbous legs , garden ornaments , and whatever else a man with imagination can think of to do with tools . Ten years ago he was doing the same things . All he wanted was to be left alone . There is a very steep drive leading up to his house , which at that time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting him in their automobiles . For years and years he has been busy in his studio , into which , by the way , he never lets anyone come ; and in fixing up his garden . MEN years ago Maxfield Parrish was not well off , largely because no one could persuade him to sell the pictures with which he lined his house . He is the sort of man who will work half a day painting a picture on the back of a postcard and then send it to a friend through the mails without any kind of covering . Rather than sell the pictures of which he was fond , he painted advertisements for electric lights and plum puddings , and gave a thousand humorous and whimsical reasons why every conscientious painter should do likewise . We wonder if he gets amusement out of being the highest paid painter . Modern Plumbing WE caught a glimpse the other day into the workings of that field of art in which Mr. Parrish has been pre-eminent for so long , the Art Calendar field . When a plumbing house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Newark , N. J. , it matters not which , a picture of an English hunting squire in a pink coat , smoking a long pipe and with his faithful setter lying at his feet . ( Pictures showing the squire leaning against the mantel shelf are best . ) The plumbing house then prints the calendars and mails them out to its customers and also to a special art sucker list of prominent Middle Western manufacturers , including for example a wealthy oleomargarine man . After a hit , the oleomargarine man writes in asking them if they know where the original painting is . They say they do , and proceed to sell it to him as a fine work of art  --  for a price which covers the cost of the whole project . It costs no one anything except the oleomargarine man , and he gets his money 's worth of fine English squire for his library . ? A/R . Joseph Schildkraut , seated .. V1 next a diffident young lady at a tea , naturally pondered over the reason for this diffidence . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who I am ? No , the young lady admitted she did n't . " I am Joseph Schildkraut , " said he . " Oh , yes , " responded the fair young diffident . " Your father is an actor . " Mencken-Dreiser S0 far as we can find out , the new novel of Theodore Dreiser 's is being discussed because it is a more or less truthful report of the Gillette murder dressed up as fiction , and because it has spread the story of Dreiser 's first meeting with Mencken  --  a revival of it , we think , as it sounds familiar . When Dreiser was editor of the Delineator he was handed the card of the now well-known Mr. Mencken . It was covered with printed matter which set forth everything Mencken had ever done or hoped to do . Dreiser was so amused that he came out of his office to look at him , and found him " a chubby pink - faced Dutchman " , horribly dressed . " Where did you get that tie ? " said Dreiser in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the Dutchman ciuietly . " Where did you get those shoes ? " " I paid for them too . " " And those trousers ? " " They are mine , also . " Dreiser was so much impressed that he rushed back into his office and got his hat ; and siezing hold of Mencken dragged him out of the building . " We must go to a beer garden , " said Dreiser . " I want to see you at your best and a beer garden is the only setting for you . " Fame AFTER a year 's sea duty aboard AFTE U. S. S. Rochester , Captain John W. Thomason has come to New York to pay his devoir to fame . He was on the other side of the world last summer when his first soldier chronicles and his first soldier pictures appeared in Scribners , and the notification in friendly letters that he was being hailed as a bright new genius sounded rather dubious when read in Shanghai . Laurence Stallings is credited with discovering Captain Thomason  --  on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burnt match on the back of a chocolate wrapper and swearing to high heaven , " Who in Hell ever made soldiers wear overcoats ? And how can you draw men 's legs when they 're swathed in all that wool ? " Stallings rescued a pocketful of sketches from the mud , and last spring they were offered to Scribners , the editors of which thought them among the most marvelous ever done of soldiers in action . But prose was needed to accompany them . So Stallings asked for prose and Captain Thomason remembered that he had written some letters to his brother during the war . He touched them up and when they came out in type , astonishment was hardly to be kept within bounds . Enthusiasts insisted that no such vivid portrayal of war had been given in a generation . Since then Capt . Thomason has done some short stories and now his work is to appear in a book to be called " Fix Bayonets " , the title of his first article . Captain Thomason is taking his praise gracefully , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be afraid that an impression may get abroad that he contemplates deserting his first Iove  --  the Marines . Off duty he is lean , brown and handsome , quiet voiced and . quite willing to sit listening until the talk flows ( as it inevitably does when he is about ) to battles  --  any battle will do . It is then that he expands . All 's Well I was the happy ending only this 1 week which divulged the recent embarrassment of Mrs. Frederick P. Warfield who , kind lady , threw wide the doors of her Colonial house near White Plains at New Year and gathered within celebrated  --  really celebrated  --  names from Manhattan to mingle with Westchester Neighbors . A good time was had by all . This included the hostess , but afterward , while the servants were clearing up the debris , she could not help noting that during the festivities her pearl necklace had vanished . What to do ? What to do ? One hesitates to play Lady of the Manor and then put detectives on one 's jolly guests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one keeps such excessively open house that one could hardly name half one 's visitors . It was in the midst of these perplexities that Tiffany 's rang up . Had Mrs. Warfield by any chance sold or given away her necklace ? For a woman ( an obscure woman it turned out , who is not a celebrity , but who came with one ) had just dropped in to have it valued , unaware , seemingly that Tiffany 's had made it ten years before and would therefore recognize it as you might a piece of your own handwriting . So Mrs. Warfield has her pearls again and the woman in whose possession they had lingered for a time is no worse off , except that she will probably have to get her grape juice somewhere else on January I , 1927 . Truth THE tireless young women of the School of Fine and Applied Arts , not content with turning out that exhausting product , Art , call us up to say that on January twenty-seventh they are putting on a revue in the Grand Ball Room of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we presume they mean our Mr. Eustace Tilley  --  and the Old Lady from Dubuque are to be impersonated in the show . The money paid by those coming to observe the impersonation is to be used to send a corps of students abroad to investigate Montmartre . The Old Lady is to be shown coming to New York , being overcome by it , and finally being cheered up by her " grand nephew " and shown the sights . We can not easily express the extent of our regret at seeing the spread of the term " grand nephew " , which implies a relationship between Mr. Tilley and the Old Lady which actually does not exist . Although Mr. Tilley addresses the Old Lady as " Auntie " no Hood relationship exists . The Old Lady was a friend of Mr. Tilley 's grandfather , but nothing more .
