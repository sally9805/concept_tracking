Who has forgotten Dictator Theodore Pangalos ? Less than two years ago he was master of Greece . Hard , cynical and perpetually sneering , he domineered . Then a coup d ' tat similar to that by which he had seized power upset him and he was clapped into jail ( TIME , Aug. 30 , 1926 ) . <P> Last week , when General Theodore Pangalos was at last brought to trial at Athens , awed spectators saw that his sleek dark hair has turned a tousled white . Wearing an old civilian suit and keeping his head bent , General Pangalos asked for a few days more in which to prepare his case . The days were granted , but his chances seem slim to escape death for High Treason . <P> <P> Meanwhile the do-nothing clique of politico-militarists who ousted Dictator Pangalos got together , last week , another Cabinet . It is the old one of Prime Minister Alexander Zaimis , re-formed to exclude Alexander Papanastasiou-which means nothing . The Cabinet has merely been reshuffled to allay strife over whether certain projected roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of London or by Fox Bros. of Berlin . Presumably Fox Bros. have lost , since their proponent was the ousted M. Papanastasiou.
