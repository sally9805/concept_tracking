Vividly do Swedes recall a day a few months ago when the Principe Alfonso slid swiftly out of Stockholm harbor . Aboard was King Alfonso XIII , the first King of Spain ever to visit Sweden ( TIME , Sept. 24 ) . But what was the tiny speedboat that darted like a water flea after the large ship ? Swedes recall that the speedboat drew alongside the Principe Alfonso which , churning the water to soapy froth , stopped . A box was lifted aboard with pulleys . The Principe Alfonso moved on . The impertinent little speedboat shot back toward Stockholm . What did it all mean ? <P> Spinners of tales said that King Alfonso had left behind him portentous letters fit only for royal eyes . Others had it that Queen Victoria of Sweden had rejected his gift of a ruby necklace as too costly . Last week came truth . <P> In Sweden , King Alfonso had greatly ( perhaps politely ) praised a thin , hard , and nearly tasteless rye bread or biscuit , famed in Sweden as knaeckebroed . Shrewdly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Might not His Majesty like a box of knaeckebroed to take home with him ? " The Admiral thought he might . <P> In the hurlyburly attendant on the departure of a royal visitor the knaeckebroed was forgotten . But the baker took speedboat , pursued , delivered a package of the famed , though nearly tasteless , knaeckebroed . <P> So passionate is the fondness of Scandinavians for knaeckebroed that recently a travel bureau in offering a conducted tour of Italy and France to Swedes , Norwegians and Danes advertised a special inducement : <P> Throughout the tour knaeckebroed , and smorbroed will be served , together with all the best Scandinavian cheeses and renowned tinned fish . <P> Smorbroed-the famed Scandinavian hors d'oeuvre-consists of pieces of buttered bread , on which are laid a bit of fish , a piece of cheese , a slice of egg , or almost any handy edibles , either separately or in combination .
