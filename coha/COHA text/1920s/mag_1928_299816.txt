When a privileged correspondent asked Edward of Wales , last week , whether he would hunt rhinoceroses , H. R. H. launched into chatty discussion of a topic now hotly debated between white huntsmen in Africa . <P> Rhinocerophiles are urging strictest " word of honor " observance of the rhinoceros season . When two rhinoceroses were shot , out of season , in South Africa last fortnight , a terrific hue and cry was raised to protect the " noble game . " <P> Far different is the view of rhinocero-phobes ( including most Afric blacks and many a white non-sportsman ) . They hold that the " noble game " is now so numerous as to seriously menace Afric agriculture , in certain districts , by persistently trampling down crops . <P> Clearly Edward of Wales must be prepared to sit in informal judgment upon the great , sporting issue of Rhinocerophobes v. Rhinocerophiles . It was unthinkable that he himself should shoot a rhinoceros out of season .                  @ @ @
