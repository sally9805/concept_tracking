To find the real value of ultraviolet glass and glass substitutes Dr. Janet Howell Clark , 39 , associate professor of physiology at Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene &; Public Health , measured light all last March , April and May . The discoveries , published last fortnight , were surprising : <P> The best ultraviolet glass , when a little old , lets only one third of the available ultraviolet sun rays pass through . ( Manufacturers claim no more . ) <P> The average amount of ultraviolet light in a 32-ft. room glazed with ultraviolet glass is only 1/600th of the noon-day 's sun . <P> A person in such a room absorbs as much ultraviolet rays in ten hours as he would get outdoors in one minute . <P> Therefore Dr. Clark decided and proclaimed last fortnight . " This amount is obviously too small to be of any great value . Any child going out for recess or any stenographer going out to lunch will get more ultraviolet radiation than she could get all day behind a window of ultraviolet transmitting glass . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in solariums , and probably in animal houses and zoos , it is unnecessary to put them in schools and offices where it would be cheaper and more efficient to send the individuals concerned out into the sunshine for a few minutes every day at noon .
