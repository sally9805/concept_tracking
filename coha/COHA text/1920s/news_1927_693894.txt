txt The Labor Party 's motion protesting against the rupture of diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia without a previous inquiry by a select committee was defeated in the House of Commons tonight by the substitution of a Conservative amendment approving of the rupture of all but normal relations . The Labor motion was rejected by 357 votes to 118 . The debate brought out no new revelations . Sir Austen Chamberlain , the Foreign Secretary , contented himself with justifying the severance of relations on grounds already made public by the Government . J. R. Clynes , for the Labor Opposition , in a rather ineffective speech , admitted that Russia was in the dock , but pleaded that she should receive a fair trial before she was condemned . It remained for David Lloyd George , speaking for the Liberals in one of the most effective efforts he has recently delivered , to ask this pertinent ques-tion : " After the break , what ?

Clynes Presents Labor Motion . 3 R. Clynes , who in view of the state of Ramsay 's health moved the Labor amendment , was at some pains to show he had no sympathy with the Soviet Government in particular or Communists in general . He admitted that Russia was in the dock , but he demanded a fresh and fair trial for her by a jury duly impressed with those considerations of international peace and commercial advantage which have been stressed from time to tiniz by Sir Austen Chamberlain him-sel The greatest sufferer from Communist activities was the Labor Party . he said , and consequently only a desire to see justice done inspired the present amendment . He pointed out that the Russian trade delegation had disavowed the illegal activities alleged by the police against some of its employes and suggested that their individual arrest and trial as criminals would have been a better course than the police raid . As for the Government 's White Paper , Mr. Clynes said that it contained . instead of sober documentary evidence , something more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Trade . A break with Russia , he continued . would mean a loss of orders  --  of which he read out a list  --  calculated to employ 5.600 men for a year in the most depressed British industries . They would have been financed by the Midland Bank credit of f10.000,000 , which he knew had been nearing the stage of completion . Great Britain , Mr. Clynes concluded . could not hope to stand so high in their esteem as America , which had few of them . " By the interchange of friendliness . " he said . " and by the exercise of greater common sense , America stands very mu higher in the regard of the Russian people . " Sir Auste- Chamberlain began with a cutting reference to the inconsistent logic of Mr. Clynes in taking the Soviet Government on trust ana to Ramsay , who on his arrival from America had condemned the British Government unheard . As for lost trade orders the Soviet representatives in England had constantly dangled the prospect of important orders before various Foreign Secretaries as an instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these phanton. millions had disappeared . Genuin trade did not depend up ' - diplomatic recognition and could not go on without special privileges , as in the United States . Chamberlain Gives Proofs . Sir Austen Chamberlain then gave elaborate proof of his charge that the Soviet Government . both directly and through its tool , the Third International , had systematically and continuously broken the trade agreement . The attempted demonstration the other day in front of the British Embassy in Washington . he thought , was probably the product of a message sent on April 9 from the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs in Moscow to agents abroad , stating : " It is absolutely imperative to organize in the shortest ? possible time meetings against England and to demonstrate where possible in front of British Embassies and Legations . " The Foreign Secretary recited the activities of M. Karalthan and other Soviet agents in China and recalled the protests and warnings issued by every British Government from 1921 to 1927 in every form , from interviews to notes . which , he said , had evoked nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense . He read in particular some protests made tst ; Lamsay himself to the Soviet Government when he was Premier and Foreign Secretary of Great Britain . Says Russia Had Fair Notice . The Russian Government , said Sir Austen , had had fair notice , but within five weeks after the dispatch of the last British note , Mr. Rosengolz , to whom it had been addressed , was telegraphing to his Government for material with which to conduct political agitation in China . Mr. Clynes had asked , " Why break now ? " The real question , said Sir Austen , was " Why not before ? " The British Government , he said , had , in the two and half years for which they had been responsible , sought peace both at Geneva and Locarno . " In all these matters in our pursuit of peace , " he said , " in every sphere , in our cooperation with the League and our partnership at Locarno , there has been but one Government which had refused to cooperate , there has been been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of pacification and reconciliation , but has sought to hinder it , a Government as hostile to the League of Nations as it is hostile to that other great league of peace , the British Empire . " Still we strove , still we continued relations which bad become a hollow sham . At last we found it necessary not to confine ourselves to spoken warnings which I had uttered again and again , but once more to repeat in solemn form our words of protest and warning . " The Soviet Government have paid no attention . They have shown that they are incorrigible . We have practiced forbearance till forbearance is worn Out . We have pushed patience to a point to which persistence in it would be weakness or dupery . But the Government can no longer take the responsibility of maintaining diplomatic relations which , so conducted and so abused , are not an instrument of peace but a fresh and criminal source of irritation and danger . " Lloyd George Attacks Rupture . Former Premier Lloyd George admitted all the facts cited by Sir Austen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austen 's conclusion . What , he asked , was the difference between now and June , 1926 , when Lord Balfour argued that a break would be unjustified except for obviously greater advantages ? There was and always had been , Mr. Lloyd George said , enough evidence to turn out the Soviet representatives to which the extravaganzas discovered in the Arcos raid added only a humorous but hardly necessary touch . The Soviet attitude from first to last had been a clumsy attempt to reconcile a desire for peace with hopes for the destruction of the British Empire , he continued . Their representatives were and had been liars , he said , but this was hardly the time to turn them out . He thought it was unfortunate that just when the Moderates were winning in China and even beginning to get the upper hand in Moscow the Extremists had won in London .

Honor , Mr. Lloyd George believed , would have been satisfied instead with a denunciation of Russia 's special tra privileges , prosecution of her alleged spies and agitators , and the resignation of M. Khintchuk as head of the Trade Delegation . The Government 's case against Russia was strong . but , he asked , was any Government guiltless of military espionage on other powers ? And now that the Government had broken off with Russia , had it considered how it was going to rest . se ? " Are You Waiting for Romanoffs ? " " What are you waiting for ? Are you waiting for the Romanoffs ? We waited twenty-five years for the Bourbons , and meanwhile there was a devastated Europe . Whom are you waiting for to give you the word ? Tchitcherin ?

" The breaking off of relations is serious business . You can not treat the situation as though everything would go on exactly as before . Twenty-four powers have recognized Russia following our lead . We shall be completely isolated in this respect in a Europe which is full of trouble . " Mr. Rentoul , a Conservative , then moved an amendment to the Labor motion approving the Government 's action in breaking off relations . Sir Robert Home , apropos of the allecrcd loss of trade , pointed out that only $30,000,000 of British goods went to Russia the past year , whereas $120 , - 000,000 of Russian goods came to England . Russia would always need English markets and would he forced to resume trade after a period of sulkiness , he argued . Explains $50,000,000 Credit Terms .

The contract , however , had not been completed at the time of the raid , he said . Lieut . Col. Moore , Conservative , said that within a few hours of the Arcos raid Americans were trying to obtain trade which had been promised under the Midland Bank scheme . Sir William Joynson-Hicks , Home Secretary , explained that the Arcos raid had been due first to accumulated knowledge of Soviet espionage which , as it had been conducted by the heads of the Soviet trade and diplomatic bodies , differed generally from the espionage methods of any other country . Their ramifications had been traced and arrests had not been made , he said , because all the spies were known and could be combed out at the proper moment .

The Home Secretary told the House that he had agreed to the Arcos raid largely because he had in his possession a photographic copy of an important War Office document which had been reproduced in Arcos House . He admitted that the document was not discovered in the raid . He thought it probably had left . Arcos House some s days before the search was made , probably as a result of a curious telegram sent by the Russian Charge d'Affaires here to Moscow suggesting that there might be a raid and advising the Russian Government to suspent for a time the forwarding of docu , meats from Moscow to London . and vice versa . As the Government at the time had not planned the raid , the telegram , he said , seemed to indicate a bad conscience .
