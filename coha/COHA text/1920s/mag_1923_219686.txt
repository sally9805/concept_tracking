" The People 's Voice " <P> Franklin D. Roosevelt , candidate for Vice President in 1920 , is rapidly improving in health . His lameness is disappearing . In Florida he swam much and fished . <P> On his way back to Long Island he stopped over in Washington and left an idea in the political pool . Congress , he suggests , should enact a law providing for national referendum on big issues . The law would direct the Secretary of State to request all Governors to put on the official ballots in national elections any question upon which Congress may wish to obtain the opinion of the electorate . <P> Mr. Roosevelt says that it is now almost impossible to know what is the will of the people , because every election is confused by a multiplicity of issues and personalities . Did the American people vote down the League in 1920 ? Some say yes ; others , no . <P> Details of the proposal remain to be worked out . " Suppose in 1924 the people should elect Hiram Johnson , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bonus . What then ? "
