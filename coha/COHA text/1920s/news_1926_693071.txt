The transaction incidentally reveals some foresight by Judge Gary in judging the future of Fifth Avenue real estate values . He purchased the corner , know. , as 856 Fifth Avenue , on which his residence now stands in 1910 and spent a fortune in the erection and furnishing of the house . After occupying his new home for a few years Judge Gary realized the property would become too valuable for a private residence and he purchased the adjoining h. ? se at 855 in 1917 , thereby acquiring ownership of a plot large enough for future development .

A statement concerning the lease was made yesterday by Judge Gary in the offices of the United States Steel Corporation , 71 Broadway . The statement was as follows : " After considerable negotiation , i have reludtantly agreed to lease this property to Mr. Paterno for a period of twenty-one years , with the option of three renewals of twenty-one years each . " I selected this site in 1910 after the most careful study of the whole park frontage situation , believing it to be as good as , if not the best point fronting on the park . I decided upon this location because , on account of the natural topography of the park in front , the street is bound to be always naturally higher than the park , and also , because taking everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most convenient for reaching points in the city . I proceeded to improve the property with a very expensive residence , and it is a pity to have the same demolished . Subsequent to my original purchase , I bought the plot adjoining on the south in order to secure a tract of land large pnough for any purpose for which it might be utilized . It has been my home for a good many years , and I do not know where I-could find another location for residence purposes as good as this . " However , I am somewhat consoled by the fact that - Mr . Paterno has agreed to erect on this site an apartment building which , I think , will be the best apartment building in appearance , solidity and finish on Fifth Avenue . It will be a ? good enough place for anyone to live with his family , and it will be an ornament to the Avenue . I would not rent the , property to anyone at any price for a second-class building .
