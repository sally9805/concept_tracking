In the post-office in Algonac , Mich. , sits Chris Smith , chewing tobacco , swapping stories with his small-town cronies , whittling small models of boats . He is founder , and his son Jay is president of the largest mahogany motorboat company in the U. S.* Last week Chris Smith &; Sons Boat Co. had cheering news for President Hoover and his industrial conferees : the company had just received the first order in the history of the industry for a solid trainload of motorboats . Fifteen carloads of Chris-Craft boats , with a factory list value of $115,000 , were ordered by the Minnesota Marine Corp . for distribution in Minnesota . Further , the Company announced that unfilled orders were at a new all-time peak for the season , that employment and payroll were at the highest level for any December in its history . <P> Whittling out duck decoys first gave Chris Smith the idea for a motorboat that would be short , broad , flat so as to ride on top of the water instead of cutting through it . This revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first boats to make 60 m. p. h. in a contest . In designing his early boats , Chris Smith used no blue prints . Instead , he carved out a small wooden model of the hull . With this in his pocket he went to nearby Walpole Island , picked out a likely looking tree for his boat , and carefully watched over its cutting and seasoning . Now there is a factory to turn out his boats by the hundred , but he still likes to get his own hands on the boats in his workshop . Brown and weatherbeaten as one of his Indian friends , Chris Smith is a most unassuming captain of industry . He has one and only one boast : that the Algonac post-office has been raised two grades through the importance of Chris Smith &; Sons Boat Co . <P> In the corporate title the " &; Sons " is far from being a fiction . The four Smith boys now run the business , Jay as President , Bernard as Engineer , Owen as Buyer , Hamilton as General Factotum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a real water baby . He ran passengers in his father 's launch before he was old enough to start the engine ; his aquatic stunts earned him the title of " the baby water wizard . " As Gar Wood 's mechanic he won many a race in boats built by his father. * Chris-Crafts tenders are popular among yachtsmen ( General Motors ' Alfred Pritchard Sloan recently bought one for his new yacht , the Ren ) because the hardware and woodwork of each one is contrived to harmonize with that of the mother ship . Of every 100 Chris-Craft boats turned out in Algonac , 13 are destined to zoom over foreign waters . Scandinavians use them as a means of commuting among the fjords and inlets . Many are shipped to Australia . The only practical means of travel in much of the South American tropical zone is the network of jungle waterways . Colombian explorers and the Ford rubber plantations in Brazil use Chris-Craft sedans . While Chris Smith chews and whittles in the Algonac postoffice , his boats are being sold by dealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> *Among the largest motor boat builders in the U. S. are , for cruisers , Elco , American Car &; Foundry ( ACF ) , Matthews , Consolidated Ship Building Corp. , Banfield ; for runabouts , Chris Smith &; Sons , Horace E. Dodge , John L. Hacker , Gar Wood , Sea Sled.
