Few diseases are more undignified in adults than mumps and few adults are more dignified than U. S. Senators . It was with sympathy not unmixed with glee that readers of The Club-Fellow , jaunty " national journal of society , " read last week that " Senator Joe Robinson has been suffering that undignified disease . . . and Senator Hiram Johnson of California has the mumps too . " These two gentlemen sit well apart in the Senate Chamber , on opposite sides of the aisle . Mumps being most contagious , there was prospect of more mumps among the Senators . Near California 's white-crested Johnson sit Indiana 's paunchy Watson and Michigan 's comfortable Couzens , in either of whom a case of mumps would wreak a startling transformation . Senator Taylor Robinson is the Democratic leader and he might have transmitted mumps to any or all of his nonimmune colleagues in the course of his whispered conferences . A great mump scare , perhaps a mump epidemic , seemed imminent . <P> But it was all a gross canard . The Senate 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Club-Fellow . Senator Joe Robinson had , it was true , a bronchial cold which kept him from his seat for five days . Senator Johnson , too , was briefly indisposed . But both were quite unmumped . Persons with respect for Senators viewed the gossip-swollen Club-Fellow with alarm . The sheetlet 's irresponsibility was further revealed by its evident confusion of the Senate 's two Robinsons . Still talking about " Senator Joe Robinson " The Club-Fellow said : " At any rate they mumps have kept Robinson quiet for a while about the oil scandals . Perhaps some of the Democrats are glad something stilled him , if only temporarily . " <P> As everyone knows , the oil-scandalous Robinson is Indiana 's Arthur R. Robinson , Republican .
