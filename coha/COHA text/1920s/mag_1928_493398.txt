the League 's machinery . Costa Rica , in particular , asked the League not long ago for an official defini ? tion of what the Doctrine really means . The League Council made a diplomatic reply . It said merely that Article 21 , which exempts the Doctrine from the operations of the Covenant , " neither weak ? ens nor limits any of the safeguards provided " in that document . The question was laid aside for the time being ; but it is likely to recur . Latin America grows increasingly restive under the domi ? nation of the United States . It finds in the League , for the first time , a European sounding-board against which it can echo its grievances . As time passes , unless through alteration of our own policy we diminish the resentment and fear which we have previously caused among these southern republics , that sounding board will be more and more used , whether the great European powers like it or not . But another important element is beginning to en ? ter into the situation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union has been a cooperative enterprise only in the most limited sense . It has been dominated by the United States , and the Latin members have been forced to accept the major policies of this country irrespective of their own ideas . This condition , however , is not necessarily a permanent one . What we want pri ? marily is to do business with the countries south of the Rio Grande . Military policy , including even the protection of Panama , the building of the new Nicaraguan canal and preventing the establishment of naval bases by other powers in the Caribbean , is secondary to this all-important matter . We are beginning to learn that the hearty good will of our customers is an important factor in this trade ; and if it is necessary ? as it clearly is ? we will go a long way toward the rnutualization of the Pan-American Union in order to keep this good will . Even the present degree of organization in this hemisphere has created an anomalous condition . We have something like a League of Nations of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members except one are also in the Geneva organ ? ization . That one , however , is the United States , which at present exerts more influence in this hemisphere than do all the others combined ; and not only does it exert this influence , but it looks with resentment upon any " interference " by the existing League in affairs on this side of the At ? lantic . Of the several developments which might alter this state of affairs , the one which is least likely is that the United States will abandon the Monroe Doctrine . While it may , as we have said , be mu ? tualized to some degree , nothing is more improb ? able than that we shall surrender our claim to a special interest in the relations between Latin America and Europe . A second possibility is , of course , that the United States may enter the League , in which case the sort of question which now comes up in the Pan-American Union would either betransferred to Geneva , or would be settled in this hemisphere under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means impossible , it certainly will not take place in the immediate future . Another possible development is the formation of a real Pan-American League of Nations , grow ? ing out of the Pan-American Union by the process referred to above . In that case , the Latin states which are now members of the Geneva organization would presumably resign from that body in or ? der not to have a divided loyalty . Such an Ameri ? can League would not necessarily be inimical to the European organization . There are those , indeed , who think that the affairs of the whole world can ? not be handled advantageously from a single place , and that , regardless of the policy of the United States , it would be advisable to have at least three leagues , equal and cooperating with one another , in Europe , America , and Asia . Each of these would handle questions arising in its own part of the world , and only when two , or all three , of these regions were affected by any dispute , would inter-league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces in the distant future , the present situation constitutes a challenge to the foreign policy of the United States which can not be avoided . Whether we like it or not , we are today competing with the League of Nations for the moral hegemony of Latin America . If we do not play our part fairly and honorably , we shall see the Central and South American states turn their faces away from us and toward Geneva as soon as they feel they are powerful enough to do so . In the past we have relied upon our sheer strength as the final argument ; in the future it will be increasingly true that sheer strength is not enough . THERE is an easy and frivolous answer to Henry Ford , who advises the young man of today to spend rather than save his money . It is that such advice is wholly superfluous . What young man does save , nowadays ? What young man , in fact , does not spend even more than he has , mort ? gaging his future income for months ahead by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an age when the best business brains , the utmost re ? sources of the science of psychology , and the fore ? most talents in art and writing are suborned for the purpose of breaking down his sales resistance , and when the whole weight of approved public opinion is applied in favor of constantly rising standards of living for everyone , young men , who are pecu ? liarly sensitive to such stimuli , ought to be the first to respond . Any who does not must be an unim ? aginative , miserly and regressive spirit , totally un ? fitted to succeed in an era of hustle . Mr. Ford 's advice on the subject was foreshad owed , some years ago , by the words of such an old fogey as a railroad president , who on this subject was strangely unconventional . It was during the time when everybody was being counselled to keep a budget , and so to be able to live within his income and build up a competence in addition . This gentle ? man testified publicly that for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invariably failed to come out even . Then , in disgust , he gave up concentrating on the attempt to limit his outgo , and devoted his attention to increasing his income . The more he spent , the more he had to earn , and so his extravagances finally forced him into emi ? nence and a salary so large that he just did n't have time to spend it all , and had to save some . Cynics will say that such sentiments as Mr. Ford 's are prompted not so much by concern for the young man as by anxiety to find a market for the tremendous productive capacity of modern industry . Mr. Ford does n't need any capital . If all the fami ? lies in the country scraped and saved , and bought millions of dollars ' worth of bonds and stocks , it would not do him the slightest good , because he does not sell bonds and stocks in order to convert the proceeds into plant and machinery . But if all the families in the country bought new Fords , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For he does sell cars , and he needs to sell very , very many of them rapidly in order to make a profit . Many other ? in fact , most other ? industries are in the same fix . The more capital people save and put to productive uses , the more competition their already over-extended plants may suffer . They do not need to have anybody save . What they want people to do is to spend more and more . Yet it is to be doubted whether the traditional advice on saving was any more unselfish than the modern . Was not its source those persons who saw the need for using the capital accumulations of others ? In an era when modern credit methods were undeveloped , when capital accumulations were relatively small , and when mechanical industry was struggling for a foothold , the enterprisers sorely needed the wherewithal to proceed . It was likely to be immensely profitable ? as sometimes it is to ? day ? to induce individuals to save and put out money at interest in order that it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proprietors of factories . Thus it became a social virtue to save . And the preaching of this virtue , like so many other forms of preaching , often dis ? guised itself in terms of promises of personal salva ? tion to the preachee . The virtue of individual saving has lost caste largely because it is no longer so economically nec ? essary to society . Indeed , it might be more accurate to say that individual saving tends more and more to become compulsory and unconscious . The old theory used to be that there was a mutual benefit to the producer and the consumer , if the consumerwould put aside part of his income to lend to the producer . The producer would pay something for the money ; it would enable him to make more goods for the use of the consumer ; and so , in turn , he would profit . Now all that is more simply ar ? ranged . You do not save anything ; you just buy a Ford . Out of what you pay , the Ford Motor Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of that profit is saved by the Ford Motor Company itself . This surplus is ample to provide the company with all the extensions and improve ? ments it needs . It does not have to borrow from you . It merely charges your mite towards the capi ? tal accumulation it wants into the price of what it sells you . This is an efficient , engineering , mass-production method that saves you the pain of scrimping . If you should put money in the bank instead of buying everything you can , you would not be playing the game . You would be promoting economic waste and stopping the wheels of industry . But what about the reward to the saver ? What recompense do you have for giving up the interest you might have earned on your money if , under the old system , you had held it and lent it to Mr. Ford ? Well , you have the car . We are coming back to the primitive conception that wealth is really not money , but goods . The more efficiently industry does your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the more cheaply they may be sold . If people will only spend more and more , they can have more and more for what they spend . Also , the more certain they will be to retain their jobs and increase their wages , because free spending stimulates industrial activity . " Cast your bread upon the waters " ? and a full meal will return to you tomorrow . It must be admitted , however , that there are pro ? ducers who sabotage this process , as well as the consumers who do so by artificially limiting their expenditures . These producers do too much saving themselves . When they have large profits , and have spent as much of these profits as they see are neces ? sary to expand and improve their plants , they still have surpluses left . These surpluses they use for such non-productive purposes as lending on call to speculators in the stock market . Or , when the call rate is too low to make that profitable , they make the surpluses a basis for stock dividends or split-ups which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead individuals to save so that they may buy stocks . None of these activities adds an iota either to the production of goods , or to the total consuming power of the public . If , instead of sav ? ing so much , the producers in question would either reduce their prices or raise the wages they pay or both , the merry process of continually expanding production and consumption of the articles they make would be advantaged . As long as they do not do so , the growth of the real incomes of their employees and consumers is endangered ; people are being taught that it is better to save than to spend . It must be admitted also that this collective proc ? ess of saving is not yet rounded out by an equally collective guarantee of economic security . You are , let us say , a faithful and trusting worker in the Ford plant , who takes seriously the doctrine that you do not need to save ; that Mr. Ford and the other employers will do your saving for you ; that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a time it seems to work . Then comes a slack period or a change in models , and you are thrown out on your nose . Or you reach the advanced age of forty or so , and you are gently informed that , with technological improvements which enable fewer men to make more goods , you are no longer needed . You go to Mr. Ford and say , where is the money you have saved for me ? The reply ii-that this is an individualistic nation , that we rely upon the sturdy virtues of personal sacrifices and foresight , . that you have had good wages instead of such so ? cialistic schemes as unemployment insurance and re ? tirement pensions . Mr. Ford and the country have better things to do with the money than to sustain you in idleness . You can only apologize for your misapprehension , and wish , perhaps , that you had been less gullible , while you join the line at the soup-kitchen . Ezra MEEKER , one of the last of the pioneers who went west in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ninety-seven . And too much history died with him ? too much is dying every day in America as one by one the Old Men pass away . For old men can never tell all they remember . Some things they remember are too ' deep for telling . The night they almost , but not quite , gave up in a blizzard when the limbs grew weary in the pitiless cold , when sleep seemed the sweetest of all blessings ? and when the death that follows sleep on a frozen night seemed not Worth caring about . The long days in a covered wagon when no road , only prairie , reached out to the hori ? zon and led them on . Nights on the long trek to Utah or Oregon or California ? to any place where gold or deep soil or religion led ? when camp was made beside some green-edged stream , and children slept peacefully as birds in a jungle , while mothers , wide-eyed , remembering Indians , watched dark ? ness creep among the willows . The days of settlement when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the green of the new wheat edged year by year wider into the wilderness of sagebrush or forest . Indians came , and women on lonely ranches were afraid when some old chieftain and his " braves " rode up . They trembled a little when he stretched out his arms to the valley and said with fierce resentment , " All my land , all my water . " But the soldiers took care of the In ? dians , killed them off in rocky ravines , herded them to reservations . As years went on they still camesometimes in the fall , but peacefully , with squaws , ' building their campfires across the creek , moving on the next day to gather pine nuts in the nearby hills . The days of civilization and plenty when fathers and mothers who had walked across the plains saw their sons and daughters , who were sometimes ashamed of them now , riding fast trains eastward , hurrying back to universities and markets , getting education and good grammar , making money ? not listening when grandfather , before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young America going west . Sons and daughters of pio ? neers going east now , " back " east , completing the circle , seeking the culture their grandfathers left when the rich black soil of Iowa , the white peaks of the Rockies , the golden depths of the California hills , called to adventurous youth east and south . . The West is peopled now . The red men lead emasculated lives on reservations ; in Montana , Idaho , New Mexico , they sit , fat and sleepy , fol ? lowing the shade that moves around grocery stores where white men sell shredded wheat and chewing gum in patented packages . The Pacific has turned the Oregon Trail back upon itself . It is as adven ? turous as ever , but it is covered with-asphalt and leads mostly east . Cars whiz by too fast to mark the places where men died slowly one hundred years ago , while covered caravans stood by in an empty world . Ezra Meeker first went by ox team over the Oregon Trail to ' Washington seventy-six years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the last man to go in a prairie schooner . Within the last few years he founded the Oregon Trail Association to mark its important historic points , and to honor the trail-blazers , of whom 20,000 lie buried in unknown graves along the 2,000 miles between the Missouri River and the Pacific Coast . Four years ago , at the age of ninety-three , he flew in twenty-four hours over the route that had taken six months in 1852 . Who could know his feelings and how could he tell them ? Some things are too deep for
