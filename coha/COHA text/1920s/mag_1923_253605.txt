In the Reichstag Herr Breitscheidt defined the Socialist position : <P> " We are not affiliated with or related to this Government , but , nevertheless , we desire to see it remain in office to liquidate the Ruhr conflict , which occurred during its rgime . <P> " Our duty is to bring about a speedy end of the Ruhr adventure . We have no friends in the world . America and England will not intervene . " <P> Herr Breitscheidt then suggested that Germany adopt the plan for payment of reparations put forward by M. Louis Barthou on behalf of France and M. Delacroix on behalf of Belgium , by which 35,000,000,000 gold marks were demanded . " What we object to in the plan , " said he , " is the stipulation for the progressive evacuation of the Ruhr and its failure to reimburse Germany for the costs of maintaining the armies of occupation . "
