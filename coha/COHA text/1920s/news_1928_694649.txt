txt GEN . BERRY 'S PENSION PLAN Its Wisdom and Legality With Regard to Teachers Are Questioned . The proposed plan of Controller Berry incorporating teachers with street cleaners , policemen , firemen , &c.,; in a unified city pension system is opposed , for two reasons ? it is unwise and it is probably illegal . It is unwise because . the present Teachers ' Retirement System is conceded to be a model . This has been safely and sanely managed since its adoption in 1917 . It gives present comfort and satisfaction for the future to 26,667 teacher members . The teachers have confidence in it . Why change it ? The Controller 's plan provides that all present teachers can retain their membership in the Teachers ' Retirement System  --  but may transfer to the new system if they care so to do . However , after Jan. 1 , 1929 , the proposed merged system is obligatory for all new teachers . There is very little chance of any present teacher transferring to the proposed merged system . The new plan and its benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Controller 's report on his plan to- the Board of Estimate and Apportionment contains the following rule : " Membership-Any employe of the City of New York after Jan. 1 , 1929 , is eligible to membership in the . system . " Evidently , the Controller thinks that teachers are employes of the City of New York . The courts have held for years , with an almost monotonous reiteration , that they are employes of the Board of Education . The City of New York is one municipal corporation and the school district of the City of New York is a separate and distinct municipal corporation ? an agency of the State for educational purposes . What power , then , has municipal authority to merge the pension system of a State agency ? J. HA RIF/Yr . Brooklyn , Dec. 20 , 1927 . Expense of Planetariums .

I can hardly imagine that S. P. Gilbert is really placing so much emphasis on this matter .

KERSTON . New York , 32ee. 06. 1921 . EDUCATING THE INDIAN . Present System , It Is Held , Leaves Much to Be Desired . THE Tuns editorial of Dec. 26 , based on the endowment of the Olive Whitman Scholarship to be used for an Indian girl of the Six Nations , suggests comment on the need of vocational education opportunities for all our Indian youth . The United States spends $6,000,000 annually on activities nominally classified as " Indian Education . " Fully 96 per cent . of Indian children , when they grow up , must work , beg or starve ; the percentage of the total who possess measurable incomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hundreds from New York and North Carolina in the East , to California and Oregon in the West , which does not . need , and . know that it needs , Indians of its own membership trained in medicine , in nursing , in agricultural leadership , ' in business management and in law . But under existing arrangements , large as is the expenditure of the Government on uses classified as educational , the Indian needs are being grievously neglected . For example , the most immediate Indian need is a training of boys ' and girls in rural and domestic economy  --  ill the many specialties of such economy . But the following is Secretary Hubert Work 's characterization of the conditions of such training now given in our Indian schools : " Teachers of trade subjects , agriculture and home economics , as a rule , have been such in name only , possessing neither education nor attainments fitting them to impart knowledge to classes of Indian students . Much of this personnel has been of the character of manual or mechanical labor to handle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but which is actually performed under their supervision and instruction by details of Indian children to an extent detrimental to the pursuit of their studies . " Dr. Work uses the past tense , but his report , which is for the year ended June 30 , 1927 , explicitly deals with conditions of today and , unless radical changes are made , of tomorrow . It should be pointed out that the situation " can be met , . at least to an extent decisive in the lives of thousands of Indian children , without any substantial increase of appropriations . At present . the heavy drain on Federal appropriations for Indian education is made by the , boarding schools for Indians . These schools are conducted as asylums on a grand scale , and into them Indian children as young as 6 years are brought ; many of their enrolments have an average age far below the age when vocational education would ? properly begin . . The per capita costs in these boarding schools are relatively large ? in excess of $230 a year for each child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board and keep , plus teaching , but it is at least five times larger than would be the per capita cost of schooling these little Indian children in day schools at their homes . Educational results call for the restoration of these younger children to their homes , and the building up of adequate day school facilities which can serve the child and the home alike . Considerations of humanity are equally self-evident and , I might add , considerations of hygiene . Once the Indian children who are not properly of boarding school age are schooled in day schools near their homes at least $1,000,000 will be released from the school appropriation for Indians , which can be applied toward giving to thousands of Indian children such vocational and industrial training , including nursing , medicine , business practices and business law , as will be exemplified in the case of the one young woman to be benefited by the Olive Whitman Foundation . The facts which I here recite have been well known to observers of the Indian question for many years . They have been pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the committees of Congress . Until now the Indian Bureau has stood fast for its ancient institution of boarding schools housing many thousands of little Indian children . A turning point in the history of our Indians will come when light breaks in the bureau mind , or outside pressure compels the readjustment of its educational system to the obvious needs and capacities of the Indians .
