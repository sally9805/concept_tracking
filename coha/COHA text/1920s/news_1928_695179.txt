txt NO TIME FOR SLANDER . Issues in the Campaign Put Vituperation Out of Place . To the Editor of The New York Times : The closing words of THE TIMES editorial " Let Hamiltonians Tremble " in today 's issue ? " but if it is a question of what the judicious will think of ? his the keynote speaker , Mr. Bowers of the Democratic National Convention explosion of great swelling words , that is another matter " ? succinctly summarizes the value cc that speech . To one who could only read it distant from the heated atmosphere and contagious and often senseless enthusiasm of the hall at Houston it seems a long vocabulary of hot-air , the piling Of Ossa on Pelion , if an incongruous classical illustration may be permitted . If the Democratic Party has nothing more to offer than partisan and it is quite possible inaccurate incriminations of the Republican Party , the country would be foolish to submit its future for the next four years to its administration . The Republican Party was flayed for , the misdeeds of individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of constructive advice was advanced . Vituperation , iterated and reiterated in alliterative and changed vocabulary , but always the same vituperation , formed the backbone and substance a the keynote speech . If the Republican Party ? I do n't excuse individuals  --  was quite as black , futile and ineffective as the speaker described it ; was such a party of blackguards , grafters , corruptionists , and so forth , as the speaker declared , the country would long have risen in revolt against it and hurled it from office . The " sainted " Administration of Wilson , so lauded and applauded , did not apparently win the approval of the nation , for when he appealed personally for a Democratic Congress the answer was a Republican landslide . What the Democratic Party needs if it is to win is not to blacken character , not to indulge in a campaign of slander and vituperation , but to propose a constructive program for the nation . Hoover may not be the choice of a majority in November , but he has insisted that the campaign shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a matter of fact , the keynote speech had not a word of constructive advice . The speaker did not even mention the capabilities and constructive administration of the " inevitable candidate . " It hurled anathemas against the invasion of States ' rights , and so forth , and yet if any one coordinate power of administration did or has done more to subvert States ' rights it is the Senate led by its ' socalled purists . Walsh of Montana and Reed of Missouri and other leading Democratic Senators , when they with their eloquence and persuasive powers in the Senate barred the admission of Smith of Illinois and Vare of Pennsylvania to seats in the Senate , when  --  not by election , but by appointment by the Governors of those respective States to fill interim terms  --  Smith and Vare appeared to take the oath of office and were denied the right of taking the oath of office and their seats , the Constitution was practically nullified and States ' rights violated . If the " States ! rights " are so sacred and inviolable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution is unquestionably our fundamental Instrument of government , how will the Democratic Party vindicate its consistency , when it clamors for States ' rights and yet barred Smith and Vare in the face of the very words of the Constitution " that no State , without its consent , shall .. be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate " ? These words are not in any amendment to the Constitution , which seems to be the shuttlecock of politics and expediency , but in the very original instrument itself in Article V. We also see Articles ' XIV and XV , amendments to the Constitution , absolutely and deliberately ignored by many of the States . And yet the party clamoring vociferously for the safeguards for States ' rights has been the chief offender in trespassing upon and denying these rights ' as declared in Article V of the original Constitution and in Articles XIV and XV in the amendments . It is hard to admire the pot calling the kettle black or even to admit its reason , wisdom and judgment . It may , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special qualifications or disqualifications of the candidates of either major party , that party which , proposing no constructive measures , but simply indulging in a campaign of slander , vituperation and malice , will not win the confidence ' of the American voter and will most likely lose the election . - IL L. L. New York , June 27 , 1928 . The Turbines of the Saratoga . To the Editor of The New York Times : The account of the record breaking speed trial of the U. S. S. Saratoga contained in a special dispatch to TILE NEW roux TIMES from Washington on June 26 , said that the vessel developed only 143,000 horsepower instead of the maximum of 180,000 horsepower because " at present the ship is operating- under a handicap , due to the recent removal of certain ' stages ' of the turbine blading , because of faults in the metal . " It is ' well known that the American Brown Boveri Electric Corporation constructed the Saratoga . In order to avoid the conclusion that this company is respon ? sible for the incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publish that hi this case the turbines in the Saratoga were designed and built by another concern and that we merely installed them as a finished unit . W. M. rzoole , President , American Brown Borer ' Electric Corp . New York , June 30. 1028 . Lincoln and Liquor . To the Editor of The-New York Times : On reading Txs anidEs the paralleled columns of the prohibition planks of the two outstanding political parties , it occurred to me that-the Republicans , in quoting Abraham Lincoln , must have ' forgotten , ' or been ignorant of , the historic Incident of the great Lincoln 's reply , to the ? politicians who clamored for the removal of General U. S. Grant from the command of the Union Army on account of his reputed whisky drinking habit . " I am sorry , " said President Lincoln , " that more of my Generals do not drink the same brand ' of whisky . " ? S. GOODFR1END. -                    @
