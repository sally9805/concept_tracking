A French political face , some-what careworn-eyes that are a perfect mask , mouth accustomed to implicit obedience to the mind , a pince-nez worn with distinction , and a business-like mustache-such were the features which the Capital looked upon , pondered on , last week . <P> Washington had glimpsed that face before-in the few unfruitful days which the French Debt Mission spent in Washington last fall . But then Washington 's attention was focused on other features , on the luminous eyes of that financial enchanter , M. Caillaux , the wizard whose great spell failed . The glances which fell then on Victor Henry Berenger , Senator from France , were sidelong , cast from eye corners . It was Caillaux 's great scene . All other characters were supernumeraries . Not so , last week . The tenor had given place to the baritone . It was M. Berenger 's solo . Victor Henry B#233 ; renger walked into the Washington scene with confidence . He came bearing the credentials of his country as Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the U. S. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France . There he is noted for many achievements . <P> At only 20 he obtained his " literary license . " At 24 he was President of the Paris Students ' Union , and before he was 30 he had ' published a number of books on intellectual or social problems . One of his books was called The Intellectual Aristocracy-he himself is an example of the aristocratic intellectuelle . He became a publisher-editor of the kind so common in France ; was associated with the Revue des Revues , La Dpche , L'Action , Renaissance Politique et Littraire . <P> He is a Senator of France and also of Guadeloupe , one of the French dependencies in the West Indies . He has held various posts under the government , and in his various capacities has made a ' number of official reports . To Americans official reports mean nothing . In France Senator Brenerer 's reports are regarded with awe , amazement and admiration . They are described as " monuments , " as " masterpieces . " <P> In the French Senate he held the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this in the U. S. is the Chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee , now held by Senator Smoot ) -a post of great responsibility , a post that has been held by Poincar and by Doumer , the present French Finance Minister . <P> And M. Brenger steps out of the world of literature , out of the world of French politics , out- theoretically out-of the realm of Government finance . He goes into the realm of diplomacy , to which he is new . <P> When he came to the White House last week to present his credentials to President Coolidge , he had not even the gorgeous uniform of a French Ambassador , the brilliant gear , with which all the diplomats of the world are outfitted . Instead he came in black , with dangling strips of broadcloth behind him-in the funereal full dress which usually marks the diplomats of only one nation-the diplomats of the U. S. He wore however the broad sash of the Legion of Honor , the orders of Queen Isabella the Catholic , of St. Maurice and St. Lazare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although he had turned diplomat , he had not left finance far behind him :
