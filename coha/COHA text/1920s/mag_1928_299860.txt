" There is a gentleman , " observed the Wall Street Journal , cautiously , last week , " who heads a large salt company who also has salty tastes . On his estate in the outskirts of a Pennsylvania city he has built a large swimming pool , containing salt water . Every two weeks the water is renewed and two tons of salt are used to make the solution sufficiently saline . In the salt manufacturer 's house there is a salt water system , so that the benefits of synthetic ocean bathing may be enjoyed without leaving the privacy of one 's bathroom . " <P> Discreet , even reticent , the Wall Street Journal deceived no one who knows the coal mining district of Scranton , Pa. , and neighboring , suburban Dalton . For as every Scrantonian knows , a major glory of Dalton is the large , old house ( recently remodeled ) of Salt Tycoon Mortimer B. Fuller . And as every saltman knows , the Fullers ( Grandfather Edward L. , Father <P> Mortimer B. , Son Edward L. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a quarter of a century . <P> The two tons required each and every two weeks for Mortimer B. Fuller 's private ocean , 100 miles from the seashore , are the least of the drains on International Salt 's mines and evaporating plants . Next in order of unimportance is the production of table salt . Major uses of salt are found in the curing of hides , manufacture of soap , paper , ice cream . <P> Tense is the competition in the salt mining industry . Saltman Fuller saw net earnings fall from $507,339 in 1926 to $327,000 in 1927 , to only $3,108 for the first six months of 1928 . On the stock exchange , International Salt dropped from a high of 92 in 1923 to a low of 54 ? in 1928 . Lessened demand , competitive price cutting , are among apparent causes of depression . <P> <P> *An error . Saltman Fuller has no salt water system in his home . He has a device , however , for softening hard water .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
