Prevailing wheat prices , based on world supply , arc too low , in the opinion of the Farm Board . Scanning the drop in prices during the week . the board , in a statement issued by Chairman Legge , expressed the belief that " this unsatisfactory price level is chiefly due to the rapid or disorderly movement which is putting a large part of the year 's supply of wheat on the market within a short time . " Nearly half the present wheat crop has been sold in the last week , Mr. Legge said . " The unprecedented liquidation of industrial stocks and shrinkage in values within the last few days has also had an effect on wheat values which is entirely unwarranted and wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by these conditions , " the statement asserted . Loan Plan Is Announced . The board announced that it had authorized immediately the use of any funds at its command to help farmers hold the remainder of their crop for better prices . To assist in the orderly marketing program which is the board 's avowed purpose , it proposes to lend to legally justified wheat cooperatives sums sufficient to bring the total amount borrowed from all sources by such associations up to a prescribed schedule . The board listed at the close of the market today what it considers minimum wheat prices this year , as it did for cotton a few days ago . The loans made through , the cooperatives will be carried until the close of the marketing season and will be prorated on these basic - prices per bushel , taking into account the customary differentials .

Under the announced plan of the board , the farmers will be able to get better than 96 per cent of the value of their wheat without immediately selling it . All loans are to be made on the regular grades of wheat , with adjustments for poorer grades or premiums from the schedule ' of prices announced . Large loans have already been made to cooperatives for the handling of the wheat crop , Mr. Legge said . It was his understanding that about $50,000.000 of the $150.000,000 appropriated by Congress for the board had already been loaned or authorized for . loans . He anticipated no delay in obtaining what further sums were needed from the balance of the $500,000,000 revolving fund provided for to carry out the marketing act .

The organization of the $20.000,000 National Farmers ' Grain Corporation was perfected during the day after a. week of ' conferences . and it is expected that the marketing of other grains , such as corn , oats , barley and rye , can be financed with Farm Board money through this agency .
