Last week , in Detroit , 3000 college students from Canada &; the U. S. gathered to attend the Tenth Quadrennial Student Volunteer Convention . They wanted to find out " What is right , what is wrong and who is responsible for good or bad in foreign missions ? " To answer these questions for the 3000 students came missionaries from dangerous distant lands , U. S. leaders of all Protestant Evangelical denominations . They met together in a Masonic Temple . <P> Right at the start , speakers began to find fault with present missionary and ministerial conditions . The most obvious and threatening obstacle to missionary success , they pointed out , is the effect of denominational rivalry upon the potentially Christian inhabitants of heathen countries . Said Canadian Dr. Richard Roberts : " The business of Christian missions is not to get people to call themselves Christians but to make friends . " At this there was a murmur of approval from the students . <P> Other speakers found other faults , suggested remedies . Said small , earnest Dr. Roy H. Akagi of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force to the Japanese people , it must first be Japanized . " Said vigorous Dr. John R. Mott : " A synthesis of Eastern &; Western relationships must claim all secular agencies as well as our Christian organizations . . . . " Other speakers pointed out that racial prejudice hampered African Missions , that the Church Charities are joined in " common law marriage " to extraneous economic agencies . Said explosive Dr. Sherwood Eddy , Y.M.C.A. Secretary at large for Asia : " The new slogan is not to evangelize but to Christianize . Missionaries must go to other lands with a gospel of love , not gunboats . We want no such protection . " <P> Said Dr. Robert Elliott Speer , secretary of the Board of Missions of the Presbyterian Church , suggesting to the 3,000 students that non-Christian lands had need of 100,000 physicians to deal with 1,000,000 lepers and hundreds of thousands of blind throughout the non-Christian world : " Outside of four or five cities , you can not find 10 qualified physicians for the 10 million people in Persia . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They attended " colloquia " where they could ask their questions for any one to answer . Most of the questions exhibited a naive idealism and an insistence on the particular rather than the general . Said one student : " Would it be possible for Christianity , Buddhism , Taoism and Confucianism to be worked together into a whole ? " " It would not , " said Dr. Francis C. M. Wei , President of Central China Christian University . Many asked : " Ca n't the missionaries bring Christ to the foreign fields without also bringing Christianity or Christian Civilization ? " One asked a question which precipitated a debate : " Would Christ be neutral in China today ? " Of the students ' questions , many remained unanswered .
