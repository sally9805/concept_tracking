txt By reason of earnings recovery , settlement of the six months guaranty account with the Government and sale , of three small detached lines in Kentucky at a good pro ' fit for $8,000,000 , Baltimore &; Ohio management expects that all of its capital requirements for the remainder of this year and 1924 will be provided for without financing . From surplus after charges of $12,758,350 for the first half of this year approximately $1,200,000 was charged out in dividends on the preferred stock and $5 , - 1000,000 as the initial cash installment on $22,000,000 worth of new equipment otherwise financed with equipment I trusts . Of the balance of $6,508,350 remaining from the half year 's earnings $1,750,000 was appropriated to complete the required application of earnings to capital Jurposes under the indenture of the 10 year collateral notes issued in 1919 , but this sum , of course , remains available for application to any capital purpose . In addition the company rectntly received $5,672,416 as final payment on the six months guaranty making a total of $12,180,766 available for various corporate purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year will yield a surplus after charges of not less than $12,000 , C0 or $13,000,000 so that allowing for preferred dividends and assuming that the directors might declare a dividend of 2%% on the common stock out of this year 's earnings , cash resources would be further augmented this year by $7,000.000 or $8,000,000 making $19,000,000 to $20,000,000 available for capital purposes . Presumably a further substantial sum will be available from earnings in excess of dividends in 1924 , which sum will run between $10,000,000 and $15,000,000- if earnings continue at anything like their present rate . OFFSET TO ADVANCING WAGES Whiir , labor costs for all the railroads will run some , what higher during the second half of this year than in the first half . a ' larger , volume ' of traffic normally moves during the second six months . In the case of the B. &; 0 . there is the further consideration that operating expenses of the first-half included ' the coatittiedithting bad order . locomotives from 285 , on Janatry 1 , 1923 , to 12.7% on July 1 and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year to the abnormally low ratio of 3% at the beginning of July . The larger proportion of this cost is reflected in maintenance of equipment as reported for five months , which increased $$1,794,797 over that item for the same months of 1922 and absorbed 25% of gross compared with 22.2% the year before . With gross revenues for the five months $26,183,200 greater than the year before 35% of revenues was devoted to all maintenance corn , pared with 34.3% in 1922. whereas transportation expenses despite the lower general freight rate level , absorbed but 37.4% of gross against 38.8% the year before . Although equipment rent debit increased $422,000 for the five months it practically ceased to increase in May and is likely to show a decrease in subsequent statements because of the rapid improvement in condition of equipment and delivery of additional rolling stock . Since B. 0 . passed its common dividend and sold $35 , - 000,000 ten year notes on terms which somewhat restricted its control of its surplus earnings for a time , the company has reinvested in the property from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieve the company of the burden of common dividend payments when that course was indicated about the middle of 1019 , the physical property being then under federal control , and is now taking its time about restoring dividend payments in the face of earnings equivalent , on a weighted basis , to $20 p share on the common stock and in any event not likely to fall below an actual $15 a share for the current year . The directors doubtless consider that their course has been vindicated by the present comfortable financial position of the road . znAmultrrms or 1025 Since the effect of the war upon the general interest . rate began to be realized the maturity of all three of Baltimore &; Ohio 's 11V2% bond issues , aggregating $126 , - 124,500 , in the single year 1925 has been regarded by many persons as a serious cloud upon the prospects for its stockholders . The great recovery in earning power which the road has made during the past two years , only temporarily interrupted by last year 's shop and coal strikes , has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have held . With common stock issue of close to $152,000,000 , an increase of say 2% in the interest rate on the capital represented by the maturing bonds would mean a difference of 1.65% in earnings on common stock . Such a difference , measured against earnings of 15 to 20% on the stock , obviously has little baring on the resumption of dividend payments .
