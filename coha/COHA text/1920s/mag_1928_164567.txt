The Cyclone Lover . One is compelled to suppose that the U. S. embodiment of the ideal lover is a gawky youth , timid and smirking , fond of stupid jokes and possessed with a dreary talent for unnecessary heroics . Herein he makes his too-customary stage appearance . Tongue-tied and blushing , he sees the daughter of a millionaire shipowner and goes infatuate . Then no longer is he a modest nonentity , almost incapable of thought or speech . Awkwardly demoniac instead , he kidnaps the girl of his lamentable dreams while she is in the act of marrying a rogue , takes her away upon a yacht , causes her fiance to appear in his true colors and marries her with affectionate alacrity in the last act . <P> This mild magazine cover farce , improbable and not hilarious , was written by Fred Ballard , who did so much better with Believe Me , Zantippe , and by Charles A. Bickford , who acted a hardboiled newspaper egg in Chicago .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
