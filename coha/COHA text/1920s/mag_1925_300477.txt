The " motor game " is much less seasonal than formerly , owing to the higher proportion of closed cars now manufactured . This is one reason why this fall production-records of the leading makers are holding up so well . <P> Another trend in the industry even more striking is the general slashing of prices to gain quantity production . Ford cars have now become so cheap that Henry Ford is beginning to feel the competition . Practically since 1908 Ford kept his famous Model " T " unchanged , and at a cost far below other makers . Since the war , about 48% of cars sold in this country have been Fords . But during the past year , Fords constituted only 42% of cars sold . This accounts for Ford 's sudden effort to make his famous vehicle a thing of beauty . <P> For the eight months of 1925 , car production has been 6% ahead of 1924 , despite the recent significant falling off in the sale of Fords while the model for the latter was being changed . As against 1924 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26% , and high-priced cars 6%.
