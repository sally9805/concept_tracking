From Calcutta there go each year to New York and Boston 68 great vessels bearing cargoes of jute fibre and burlap cloths , raw materials for carpets , rugs , bagging , sacking , scrims , tarpaulins . Homely though the cargoes be , they bring a nabob 's revenues to the ship owners . To gain Indian trade , ship captains two centuries ago piratically cut each other 's throats . Last week operators seeking the same trade punctiliously cut their own rates . <P> Kermit Roosevelt and John M. Franklin , with no pomp but little circumstance , began the rate war . They are respectively the sons of the late President Roosevelt and President Philip Albright Small Franklin of the International Mercantile Marine ; and respectively they are the president and vice president of the Roosevelt Line , which operates U. S. Shipping Board vessels between India and U. S. ports on the North Atlantic . <P> Their ships have carried practically no jute . The Isthmian Line , potent ship subsidiary of the U. S. Steel Corp. , have carried four cargoes a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellerman- Bucknell Line ( oldest in the trade ) the rest . They had old , excellent contacts with the chief U. S. importers of jute-the Bemis Bag Co. , Ludlow Manufacturing Associates , Chase Bag Co. , American Manufacturing Co . <P> A year ago when the Indian jute shippers were making their 1927 cargo contracts , the Roosevelt Line asked for a free hand in securing 16 ship loads . The intrenched companies politely laughed at their bumptiousness . <P> Last week contract time came again and again the Roosevelt Line sought to break into the jute trade . Nor did they come softly . They brandished before the eyes of shippers and importers of jute a freight rate card . That card offered to carry a ton of jute from Calcutta to New York or Boston for approximately $4 . The rate had been $7.90 a ton . The Cunard-Brocklebank officials read the Roosevelt Line rate figures and , counting well on the loyalties of old clients , reduced their rate to $4.50 a ton . A rate war was on .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
