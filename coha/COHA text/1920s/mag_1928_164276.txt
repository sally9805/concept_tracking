Splendor and shouting , pomp and martial music marked the triumphal entry into London , last week , of the Amir of Afghanistan who styles himself " The Peace of God " and is parading with a resplendent suite through Europe ( TIME , Jan. 23 et seq . ) . <P> Upon the station platform waited George V , cloaked impressively as a Field Marshal , and accompanied by Her Majesty . Beside them stood the unfamiliar apparition of ruddy and rotund Prime Minister Baldwin in full court dress , with tight knee breeches and a jingling sword . Ranged in the background were the Cabinet , My Lord Mayor of London Sir Charles Batho , many a civic dignitary , and finally , stretching away for blocks , the regiments of Guards . All these showy humans were mustered to remind the Sovereign of Afghanistan how mighty is the Commonwealth whose tutelary empire , India , lies at Afghanistan 's back door . <P> Came at last the Afghan special train , chuffing slowly in from Dover . The Amir was first to descend , clad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saluted the King-Emperor , clasped his hand and bowed , then turned to kiss the Queen-Empress ' gracious finger tips . Meanwhile Queen Thuraya of Afghanistan had appeared at the door of her salon car and stood irresolute , ignored . Instantly Queen Mary , with ready tact , hurried across the platform to welcome in matronly fashion petite Queen Thuraya . The Amir , having ignored his Consort , made one more faux pas , a few moments later , as he rode beside the King-Emperor to Buckingham Palace . Although intently watched by thousands of Londoners , who teemed upon the sidewalks , " The Peace of God " unconcernedly blew his nose into his fingers and then wiped them in his dove grey cloak . <P> Further entertainment for Afghan Royalty , in London last week , included : 1 ) Banquets at Buckingham Palace , Guildhall , and the Foreign Office ; 2 ) Lodging of the Royal Afghans in a suite of rooms at Buckingham Palace completely redecorated in the favorite Afghan colors , black &; gold ; 3 ) A review and sham battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of which bombed and set fire to a cluster of tents which might just as well have been an Afghan village ; 4 ) Preparations for a great naval review at which Amir Amanullah would be given an opportunity to descend beneath the waves in a British submarine and would view upon the surface the visible embodiment of Sea Power .
