" I am a candidate , " announced a certain politician last week , " for Governor of Ohio , and the Democratic Ticket . . . . I am conscious of the fact that my personal political success is of no consequence to the public . Whether I win or lose makes no difference in the forward march of Ohio , unless I can make a definite and substantial contribution to her progress . . . . <P> The singular negative twist of this statement made people read it again . What upright-downright politician was this , so lacking in illusions , so intellectually honest , that he would publicly admit that the voters might conceivably get along without him ? <P> The candidate 's name was Martin L. Davey , U. S. Representative from Kent , Ohio . <P> Readers of national advertising quickly recognized the accent of his statement as the same accent that appears in advertisements for the Davey Tree Expert Co. , such as : " Davey Tree Surgeons will not treat any tree for you that in their judgment is too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you with your untrained eyes must depend on their professional honor . . . . Davey Tree Surgeons will give nothing but first aid treatment to a tree that is starving . . . . Many clients urge them to break this rule by treatment of a hopeless case . . . . They answer : ' Yes , but our reputation is at stake . ' " <P> Treeman Davey and Congressman Davey are the same . A brother , James A. G. Davey , helps with the tree business , as eastern representative and vice-president . But Martin L. Davey it is who cultivated to many-branched , nationwide spread the company planted in 1908 at Kent , Ohio , by the late John Davey , their father and " the father of tree surgery . " In addition , Martin L. Davey has found time to be Mayor of Kent , Ohio ( 1914-1918 ) and a member of every Congress since the 65th except the 67th , when few Ohio Democrats survived the Harding gusher . <P> Further excerpts from Treeman Congressman-Candidate Davey 's gubernatorial prospectus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to cut down the cost of government . . . . <P> " . . . I know the taste of adversity . It is my earnest desire to keep a wholesome contact with the plain people . . . . "
