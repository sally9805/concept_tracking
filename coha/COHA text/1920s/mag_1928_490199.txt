IN the second-story window of what used to be a stable , m Fifteenth Street near Union Square , a stalk of corn is growing . We know about it because we chanced to see it , and we mention it because it amuses us . It evidently also amuses the person who lives there , fur it is not an accidental cornstalk , but a deliberate one . All around arc garment factories , warehouses , shops ; here in the window is early autumn . The corn is in the tassel , and it seemed to be withering before its time . For a long time we stood looking up at it . There may never he a harvest ; yet we like to think that on white clear nights there is a strange whispering in Fifteenth Street . Have n't we known , ever since we were a child , that there are witches in every cornfield ? IT is gratifying to be able to announce that appreciable progress has been made in the appearance of the human body . The zest for tanned skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our townspeople , it seems to us , has never been better . As we recall the old days , nudity in the presence of sunlight could be attained only by ladies at Juan Ies Pins and little boys on the Harlem River . That is all changed . The past summer has seen shoulder straps let down alluringly to the sun all along Long Island 's merry shingle . The happy results are now apparent at every party where evening dress is worn . ( Of course , some of the most deeply sunburned people look as if they begrudged every minute spent out of doors  --  but they arc handsome , notwithstanding . ) Stockings , as we 've said before , have been discarded by certain of our gentlewomen , and hats by many of our gentlemen . Brown leg-wax lends an added lustre and an appropriate autumnal tone . In the country , they are sequestering private swimming pools to preclude the antique formality of bathing suits .

ABOUT once a year the human soul I I gets into the papers , when the British scientists convene . Once a year the mystery of life , the riddle of death , are either cleared up or left hanging . The reports of the learned men enthrall us , and there have been moments when we 've felt that we were really approaching an understanding of life 's secret . We experienced one of those moments the other morning , reading a long article on the chemistry of the cell . Unfortunately , when we finished we happened to glance into our goldfish tank and saw there a nrw inhabitant . Frisky , cur pet snail , had given birth to a tiny son while our back was turned . The baby mollusk was even then hunching along the glassy depths , wiggling his feelers , shaking his whelky head . Nothing about Frisky 's appearance or conduct had given us the slightest intimation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newcomer , we grew very humble , and threw the morning paper away . Life was as mysterious as ever . W have come to believe that pretty early the keenest business minds in this country are its artists and its literary folk . Creative persons have become marvelously adept at exploiting their work , and have very little time for the work itself any more . To be a genius , one must first be a live wire . Take any reputable novelist these days ? he is rushed to death most of the time : dates with his publicity representative , dates with his publisher , dates with Macy 's , dates with characters in his next novel . Take any conscientious poet  --  long before he writes a poem he is busy around the town selling the idea to a publication .

Frau MISS EDNA FERBER , the novelist , who lives in Central Park West , may not vote this year , because of something that happened when she registered prior to the last election . The clerk was taking down the facts about her ; name , address , age , and so on . When he came to the question of ? cellpation he did n't bother to ask her about that . He simply glanced up at the author of " So Big " and " Show Boat " and then wrote " Housewife . " Peanuts and Crackerjack PROBABLY for the last time in our life we went to two ball games in succession , last week . The trip to the hall grounds is too lone , the crowds are too great , the I.R.T. did n't get us home in time for dinner . Furthermore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a game , are in a state of clamant siege . Just under the " L " station at Jerome Avenue , an Italian urged us personally to buy a hot clog . We were heckled by men selling red balloons eight feet long , miniature ball hats , raspberry ice in lily cups , jumping rabbits , even chocolate layer cake . Throughout the game there is a constant chant of Horton's-ice-cream . After one game a sallow man accosted us in an open field and bade us play with him at dice right there . We did n't , but others did , and a crowd gathered , hemming us in until a shocked gentleman who looked like the late Admiral Dewey dispersed it be threatening to call the police . We went to the games largely to determine whether New York is really a home town , ardent in its support of the home team , or whether , as experts have asserted , most everybody wants the Yankees to lose . We can report only the conclusion that people who attend ball games in this city are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Ehmke , the Philadelphia pitcher , hurt his leg and had to retire with the bases full of New York players , a dour fellow shouted in our ear that all Philadelphia players are yellow dogs and that Mr. Ehmke was not injured at all . When the substitute pitcher won the game for the Athletics , this detractor arose and cheered for them . Niatting shows the vagaries of the crowd more clearly than the way Babe Ruth is received . He is unquestionably the biggest one-man show in sports around town . Neither Mr. Hitchcock 's polo stick nor Mr. Tilden 's racquet can stir an audience as does Mr. Ruth 's hat . Once when he was purposely passed so that he could n't hit the hall , the stand booed the pitcher.1Vhen he hit a home run and won the game Tuesday , the 0 crowd rose like a thundering wave and tossed a spray of straw hats , score cards , and newspapers upon the field .

But we are not very sure about that . It was interesting to note , although we could not correlate the fact , that the army of parked cars outside came mostly from New Jersey , Connecticut , and Massachusetts , and very few from Pennsylvania . One moment in the Tuesday game , which Ruth won with his home run in the eighth inning , was affecting . In the ninth , from his hidden seat in the Philadelphia dugout , the aging Cornelius McGillicuddy , of Philadelphia , sent forth , to try to save the game , two players whose names were magic when Babe Ruth 's was unknown . One was Eddie Collins , the other Ty Cobb .

Art Is Long APRETTY New Jersey girl sailed into port last Saturday with two large crates containing several score paintings which she had completed during six months in Paris ( she is only twenty-one but strong and vigorous ) . She had tried to sell the paintings in Paris , but there was considerable coinpetition , and nobody bought any . Still proud and confident , she entered them on her customs declaration as having a value of twenty-seven hundred dollars . At the dock she discov-ered that this meant she would have to pay a very large tax , and she had only eleven dollars . A practical customs official met the emergency by suggesting that she change her declaration to read " No Value . " The young lady walked off by herself , had a short cry , and then followed the advice , leaving the pier with both her paintings and her eleven dollars , if not her pride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to what the movies paid George Bernard Shaw for appearing before the Movietone , and how he came to do it , is settled by the arrival of travellers who talked to the Irish playwright abroad this summer . %Vc are told that the film means a clear half million dollars to the movie people , and they make a secret of the matter . Shaw , however , makes none . He received no payment himself , but he suggested that his secretary he given something . This was done . The secretary got six or eight hundred dollars . The Movietone representative in England had written Shaw asking that he pose . Shaw had steadfastly refused to traffic with the movie industry and he might have refused , but about that time he happened to see a Movietone of Mussolini in action . A dramatist who has cast and directed his own shows , he did n't think much of Mussolini as an actor . He thought he could do much better himself . Forthwith he replied to the Movietone man , inviting him to come to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the success of his film and likes to talk about it . The Commodore WHEN the pretty sails of the yachts are furled after Larchmont 's final regatta of the season at the end of this week , Mr. Henry L. Maxwell will have completed his first year as commodore . Yachting folk are inclined to agree that he is a vital new clement in the sport . He has stimulated things greatly this season . For one thing , he sets a worthy example . He makes a career of owning encouraged his son 's interest in the sport ; when other youngsters were still tagging after governesses , Harry Maxwell had a " marine nurse , " Cap'n Jimmie Smith , all-round boatman . Harry soon got to be pretty good . When he sailed on his father 's yachts they usually won . In his early teens he was a crack racing skipper . He and Mr. Sherman Hoyt were for several years the boy wonders of the Sound . Friendly rivals then , they are so today . Before the elder Maxwell died he sailed his schooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last year , on the twentieth anniversary of his father 's triumph , Henry Maxwell took the King 's Cup with his fifty-footer , Barbara . He still owns the Barbara , also the Banshee , a forty-footer , with which he has won fifty first prizes , the six-metre Lanai , the Isolde , the power launch Duck Soup , the eighty-foot power yacht Tara , flagship of Larchmont , and an odd lot of small craft which his three sons sail from their summer home at Fisher 's Island . He is considered one of the smartest helmsmen in the country . In a race he uses a traffic cop 's whistle . One blast brings Red Pete , his sailing master , aft for instructions . Two blasts is the signal to execute them . Most of the grade A yacht dubs hereabouts claim Mr. Maxwell as a member  --  the New York , Indian Harbor , Seawanhaka , Corinthian , American , and the Eastern , in addition to Larchmont . He holds a non-resident membership in the Royal Nassau Sailing Club . Besides his summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glen Cove , another on Thimble Island in the Sound , and another at Lake Placid . As winter quarters he has a house in Princeton and an apartment in East Fifty-second Street , but he also often goes to Nassau in the Bahamas in this season for the small-boat racing there . Helen TT is fun watching Helen Wills play 1 . a man . We sat in the long sunlight at Forest Hills the other afternoon and watched her in an exhibition match with Bowman . In appearance , Miss continues to be strangely decep-tive  --  part Amazon , part Peaseblossom  --  it is never possible to make up your mind which . When she steps up to the base-line to serve , she points her left toe like a dancing master ( she walks a little like Howard Marsh , anyway ) . Then she winds up and sends a ball crashing across like the lady she is . Racing all over the backcourt , she hammers the hall hard with her strong right arm , and then , at the end of the point , minces back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady might crink it who had just spilt a little tea on the floor . Beagfing A air of excitement prevails now in the fine homes of Peapack , N. J. The hunting of the hare will soon be on in full hue , the music of the beagles will he loud upon the hills . Beagles , as the other half may not know , are short-legged little hounds with floppy ears and sad , troubled voices . There is nothing exactly comparable to the baying of twenty or thirty of them . Peapack has two fine packs . One hunts in the morning , the other in the afternoon . Other places have hare hunts too , but Peapack 's , which take place every Saturday regularly until deep snow , are as exciting as you will find anywhere . The morning run begins at someone 's estate after an early breakfast . There the huntsmen and huntsladies meet the hounds , which are brought up in a truck . The Master of Hounds , who wears a little cap and a green jacket , blows a horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . If they do n't , he hits one or two of the ringleaders a smart cuff . Two Whips , also dressed in green , take up their positions , one on either side of the pack , and off they go , the ladies and gentlemen , muffled in heavy sweaters , walking briskly after them . It is like fox-hunting , except that the hunters are afoot . Soon the hounds sniff the air and give tongue . Away they run , into the fields , through the brambles , toward the hills . The hunters run after them . As like as not , after about half an hour , it comes out that the beagles are chasing a rabbit . This is a grave error on their part , since the object is to chase hares . Rabbits are too easy . If the pack has made this error the Mas ter toots his horn and the Whips snap their whips to call off the dogs . Since a beagle has as much fun chasing a rabbit as a hare , it is often difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spank the hounds , pinch them , and so on , to get their minds off the rabbit . When the hare is seen there is a cry of " Tally-ho ! , " and the chase is on in dead earnest , uphill and down . Some of the huntsmen and their ladies drop out because of twisted ankles , blistered feet , and weariness . Limousines course the main roads to succor these . The strongest hearts and limbs carry on . The dogs seem to like to plunge into the wooded hills , lose the hunters , and go it nu their own . This may be fun for them , but it is n't for the gentlemen and ladies . Sometimes they have to go hallooing and tooting for an hour before they come upon the little rascals  --  with always the chance that the pack is after a rabbit again . There is , in fact , more than a chance of this ; there is a likelihood . One outdoorsman tells us that in the long beagling season last year he never saw a hare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't expect to see one caught this year either , as he is going to stay out of town , one where and another , until the season is quite Over . Treatment POSSIBLY we should n't reveal this . It has to do with an elephant charmer , a very beautiful one ; and ordinarily the private affairs of an elephant charmer should not be aired . Still This lady goes to the Bronx Zoo more for psychological reasons than because she loves animals . She charms Luna , a large female elephant . In doing so she derives a feeling of power . Luna likes peanuts moderately well , but her appetite in this regard has been satisfied over a long period of years . Now what she really likes is not peanuts but THE NEW YORKER lump sugar . So the lady carries to Luna 's outdoor pen a little bag full of Crystal Domino cubes . While crowds of people stand there , mildly engaging the attention of the lordly beast by offering nuts , this lady pushes her way through to the front , discloses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the pen , and calls softly , pachydermically : " Here Luna , here Luna ! " She says that without a moment 's hesitation Luna drops everything and comes across to her , bulky and magnificent . This astounds the bystanders and gives the lady just that feeling of power which an analyst has told her she must occasionally experience to be well . September Has an R THE oyster business is n't what it used to be . Prohibition almost did it in New York , although larger , consumes only about one-fifth as many oysters as it once did . Twenty years ago a dozen oyster boats were moored along the wharves at the foot of West Twelfth Street . Gay and brightly painted , they made a well-remembered landmark . Now there are only three oyster boats , and they are moored at the foot of Pike Street , in the shadow of Manhattan Bridge . Adorned with porches , Posters , window blinds , and gewgaws , they conceal their humble origin as barges . They look like a trio of villas from Flatbush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as boats go , they do n't get around much . The actual fishing is done by saltier craft ; these barges serve only as a floating depot for the handling of the catch . Inside , they are really small factories . Rows of men in rubber hoots and rubber aprons stand at benches , armed each with a hammer , a tiny anvil , and a hooked knife . With these they crack the shell , split it open , scoop out the oyster , and drop it into a container , all with accomplished rapidity . They have a lot to do . Sometimes they open forty million oysters in the course of a year . As the men work , empty buckets are rolled in and filled buckets rolled away . Oyster schooners may be seen at almost any hour unloading at one end of the barges . Delivery wagons Load at the other end . Machines for chopping ice roar and grind . There are I ) 1Eccs in the barges , in which telephone bells ring and typewriters rattle . It is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heave under his feet that a visitor realizes he is afloat . The boat belonging to the firm of George M. Still is the veteran of the fleet . From grandfather down , since long before the Civil War , the Stills have been oystermen ; the present head of the firm is sixty-eight years old and grew up with ascoop-knife and hammer . For many years he served oysters and beer at his restaurant in Third Avenue above Fourteenth Street  --  a famous resort in the clays when Union Square was the Rialto . Prohibition dosed him out . The last of his neighbors on Third Avenue , Allaire 's , went under the hammer four months ago . Oddly enough , the World War formed a sad chapter in the history of oysters in these parts . Shortly after the opening of hostilities strange maladies began to decimate them , even in their beds twenty fret below the waves . No one is quite clear as to the cause of this , it seems . Mr. Still is not quite clear himself , but he says he thinks it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up after the Treaty of Versailles and have been better since . Mr. Still reports the present oyster season as beginning auspiciously . Life Since Prohibition DURING the trial of a bootlegger in a local court , his liquor was introduced as evidence . Experts who had tested it swore that it was genuine , hefore-the-war stuff . This astonishing fact made a profound impression upon everyone present and may have had something to do with the fact that the jury acquitted the accused . At any rate , so we are told by a lawyer who was there , the foreman of the jury called to him just before he left the room , a free man . " Say , " he said , " let me have your card . I 've been trying for years to get a bootlegger who handled real stuff . "
