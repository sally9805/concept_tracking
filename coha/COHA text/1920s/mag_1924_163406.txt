The old complaint that things ca n't be run on air is thoroughly exploded . Chemists have for years been making some most important compounds out of the raw material of air . " Free " oxygen and nitrogen in the air , for instance , can be " fixed " by a gigantic electric arc into nitric oxide , from which nitric acid and nitrates ( valuable fertilizers ) are made . <P> Then in 1914 Fritz Haber , clever German necromancer , found that nitrogen gas can be captured in another way-by combining it with hydrogen to form ammonia . Instead of electricity , the Haber process makes use of an agent called a " catalyst , " which is a substance that by its mere presence causes the union of two other elements . Efficient catalysts , or as Dr. E. E. Slosson calls them , the " good mixers " of chemical society , are expensive . Haber used uranium , platinum or some other rare and finely divided metal . When the nitrogen and hydrogen , after being elaborately purified , mixed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. , are passed over the uranium , the resulting gas contains from 4% to 8% of ammonia , which can be condensed to a liquid , used in refrigeration , etc. , or further transformed by the Ostwald process ( another catalytic ) , into nitric acid . The Haber process was the industrial and agricultural mainstay of Germany in the War . Shut off from her tremendous imports of fertilizers and explosives , her biggest dye-works , the Badische Anilin und Soda-Fabrik , remodeled its plant to manufacture fixed nitrogen and nitrates , and the Central Empires became chemically independent of the rest of the world . <P> Chemists of all nations have been seeking to improve the existing methods of nitrogen fixation . Last week the most important discovery since Haber 's was announced from the fixed nitrogen research laboratory of the Chemical Warfare Service of the U. S. Army , at Washington , by Dr. Arthur B. Lamb , director of the laboratory , and professor of chemistry at Harvard University . A new catalyst has been found to unite the atoms of nitrogen and hydrogen into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twice the amount given by the Haber process . The nature of the catalyst was not announced , but it has far greater durability , and will make possible explosives and fertilizers both more effective and much cheaper than any now existing .
