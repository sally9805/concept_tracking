txt Formal notice of the order of the Department of Labor for her deportation was served yesterday on Vera , Countess of Cathcart . She announced at once that she would fight it to a finish . " Thank God , this is n't British justice , " said the Countess . " Give me British justice any day . In England you 're not guilty till you are proved SO . " The Countess accepted the offer of the legal services of Arthur Garfield Hays , counsel for a group of men and women who have interested themselves in fighting the deportation order against the Countess on the ground that her admissions do not convict her of moral turpitude within the meaning of the law . The fight , it was said , would be carried to the Supreme Court of the United States . Mr. Hays said that habeas corpus proceedings probably would be started this morning . William A. De Ford , counsel for the Countess , who presented her appeal to the officials and who was expected to represent her in court , announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Countess Cathcart retained me to prosecute , before the Board of Survey in Washington , her appeal from the order for her deportation entered by the local board of inquiry , " he said . " The service which that retainer contemplated has been performed . " The Countess has aecepted the services of Arthur Garfield Hays , counsel for a group of public-spirited women , who will hereafter represent her in the effort to secure a sound judical construction of the provision of the general immigration law under which the Department of Labor proposes to exclude her , and a correct and valid application of that law to the facts in her case . " I will be deeply interested , as a citizen , in the success of Mr. Hays ' effort , and will render him any assistance , in conference , that he may ask and that I can %lye . " The Countess predicted that she would be freed on bail and that she* would be living at the Ritz or the Ambassador within a few days , p . nding the outcome of legal proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous deportation cases it was considered possible that this litigation would drag on in the courts for a year . Lady Craven Leaves City . Lady Craven left the Grand Central Station last night for Montreal , where she will join her husband , Lord Craven , the corespondent in the suit which led to the divorce of Countess Cathcart . Immigration Commissioner Henry H. Curran , who issued the order to deport the Countess and has been a central figure in the controversy since then , was ill with a cold yesterday and remained at his home . Byron H. Uhl . Assistant Commissioner , discussing the legal aspect of the case , said : " Ordinarily in any case when appeal is dismissed , the person is placed on the next vessel of the line which brought her to this country , unless a stop order is issued by the courts . " If a writ of habeas corpus is procured , it acts as a stay of deportation until the courts have 7endered a decision . She can receive bond for immediate and temporary release only by order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . " Those cases , such as the Countess 's , usually require eight to ten days before they are acted upon by the district court , and nine out of ten cases are dismissed and the alien remanded to the custody of the immigration authorities for deportation . Says She May Go Voluntarily . " If the writ is refused the Countess may be deported on the Aquitania , which sails for Cherbourg and Southampton at 1 o'clock Saturday morning . Who knows ? The Countess may go voluntarily . It is possible that she may be deported Saturday on either the Aurania. to Liverpool or the Antonio to London . Both of these ships are owned by the Cunard Line . " The Countess was tying down most of the day in her room , it was learned , and her hands were swollen from nervous exhaustion . Her friend . Mrs. Gordon Carr , who left Ellis Island early in the afternoon , said the Countess was extremely nervous and that it was absolutely necessary that she have quiet . She saw the representative of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had sold certain articles . It was during the morning , when she agpcared before Assistant Commissioner Uhl , and after a sleepless night , that the Countess showed grief and indignation at the decision of Secretary of Labor Davis , and denounced the statute on which the order of deportation was based . She insisted on seeing reporters in the presence of Mr. Uhl . and during the interview she frequently insisted that numerous newspapers had been unfair to Cornmissioner Curran , and " poor sportsmen " in not placing the blame on the 11 Secretary of Labor who had rendered the final decision for her deportation . At times her Voice rose fi : ? a bitter shrillness , and then , due to her emotion , became so low that her words were almost inaudible . She readily consented to be photographed , and said , " Let the photographers do their worst , I do n't care now , " when Mr. Uhl inquired if she were tired of posing . She , , , , repeated that there was absolutely no truth in the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but admitted that while in England she had received offers from a newspaper to purchase certain articles she had written . Statue of Liberty in Fog . Observing through the windows of the Assistant Commissioner 's office that the Statue of Liberty was hidden by the dense fog , the Countess said , " She is ashamed of herself and is hiding her face from me . However , I thank God I have n't lost my sense of humor : " She cited two cases of admission to the United States , one being that of an unmarried Irishwoman who brought an illegitimate child to this country but was admitted from Ellis Island . The other case , she said , was that of an English army officer , who , she asserted , was the guilty one in a divorce action but was permitted to enter the United States temporarily by the Secretary of Labor . The Countess said that her deportation order was unjust , because of the fact the Irish girl was admitted to the country . " Why distinguish between men and women , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . At this point she again expressed the conviction that she had an enemy in the United States with tremendous influence . saying that unless this were the case , she was at a loss to account for her order of deportation while admission was granted in the two cases she mentioned . She said such injustice was unbelievable . " No , I do n't think my enemy is the Earl of Craven , " she continued . " He has no influence , but I think it is one of his relatives , who is under the erroneous impression that I might publish things against the Earl . " I did not come here to be vindictive . although they believe I came to publish letters . I decidedly am not a vindictive woman , and if the Earl of Craven and Lady Craven are happy , I am only too pleased . No , I do n't care to mention the name of my enemy . " ' Fight to the Bitter End . " The Countess again said she had done nothing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl of Craven for which she is " looked upon as a criminal . " Then her voice rose to a shout as she said : " I 'm goink to fight to the bitter end . I will fight until I jolly well have to give in . " Forcing the tears back , she went on : " What would I have done but for my friends in America , particularly the women ? After all , I am only a defenseless woman in a strange land . The American women have been perfectly wonderful to me . " The Countess said that the decision I was unexpected . " I am innocent of any crime , " she said , " and naturally did not expect such a decision . Thank God ? this is n't British justice . In England you 're not guilty until proven so . But in this country apparently 1 you 're guilty whether ? ou 're innocent or not . Thank God , they ca n't put me in the electric chair , although I dare say Mr. Davis would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoarsely and hysterically . Controlling her emotions to some extent , she continued : " Poor little me . Why , oh , why , do they consider me a dangerous woman ? " Then , in hasty words and angry tones , she bitterly denounced the British and American Consuls . The American Consul in London , she said , accepted about two pounds from her for her visa and did not warn her she could not enter the United States . She said she had cabled to Sir Austen Chamberlain , British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , her appreciation of his kindness in instructing the British Consul at New York to assist her in any way he could , but continued bitterly : " I do n't know what the British Consul is here for because he ca n't do anything for you , and I think the British people are being taxed up to the hilt for the Consulate in the United States . No Justice Here , She Says . " Yes , if I were in Great Britain I would be given a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried at Washington yesterday , and I was n't there . This would not be heard of in England . How can I defend myself when I am held at Ellis Island2 It is not fair or just . " The Countess then jumped out of her chair and in a piercing voice exclaimed : " Oh , no , give me British justice any day . It is beyond my conception to think of what is happening in this country , such as my deportation case , and then think of the terrible divorce cases which are produced in your country every day . But . ah , there is a difference . Some of these atrocious divorcees have money and are later recognized in English and American society because of their money . " Later the Countessotaid she had received several letters from her two children , but that her whereabouts were being kept a secret from them Both are at school in England , she said . She expressed great pleasure over a cablegram from her fiance , Ralph Neal , the English dramatist . " Ralph is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , he 's marvelous . He is not thinking of my past but of my future . " Denying that her fight to enter this country was to obtain publicity for a sty of her life to be published here , she stated flatly that she had signed . no contract with any news organization or publisher . She admitted she was writing certain of her experiences for a newspaper , but had been able to write little lately because she was too distracted . Speaking of her experiences at Ellis Island , the Countess said that Commissioner Curran " had not only shown himself to be a great sportsman but a kind gentleman . " adding : " In England they told me of the horrors of Ellis Island , but I really have n't found it awful . I 've had good food , a very good bed , a nice little room and kind treatment , but , of course , it is n't the Ritz . However , it is rather fine , after all . " She said that in the letter from her London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding her , he wrote : " I was financially and morally a fit person to enter the United States . " The Countess denied a published report that she was 45 years old . She said she was born May 14 , 1894 . WARNED BEFORE SHE SAILED . Lady Graven Says Countess Was Told She Would Not Be Admitted . Before Lady Craven 's departure last night for Montreal to join the Earl of Craven she said to the newspapermen at the Grand Central Station : " I know for a positive fact , from the best authority in London . that Lady Cathcart was warned before she sailed that she would not be admitted into the United States . " This act was planned to bring all the humiliation possible to 4ord Craven and myself , but I 've been having a great laugh . The past week I have had a wonderful time . Everybody has been so kind and they have really made me feel that their sympathies are with Lord Craven , who always has had a host of friends in New York City . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after meeting in their Dugout in East Fifty-eighth Street , went to the station to reassure Lady Craven of their sympathetic feelings for her and her husband , a disabled British war veteran . They conveyed to her a message from the meeting , which read : " As disabled American veterans of the World War , we are here to express our resentment of the official action which has caused Lord Craven , a disabled veteran who lost his leg in the war , and who is an American on his mother 's side , so much embarrassment , and inflicted so much suffering on his wife and mother . " Tears came to Lady Craven 's eyes as she read the message , " The Amerisaid , " and this action of the veterans said , ' and this action of the veatrans is , indeed , touching . " Lady Craven added that the expression of the disabled veterans interpreted her husband 's feelings in the matter , asserting that he frequently had said ha felt as much an American as an Englishman . For this reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt him more than anything that ever happened to him before . She promised to visit the veterans when she returns in April , probably from Bermuda . The disabled veteran who delivered the message to Lady Craven was asked by he : if he managed to get around without difficulty . The veteran replied that he did , volunteering the information that he works on Ellis Island . Lady Craven laughed heartily . " I hear it is a very pleasant place , " she said . Lady Craven said that she and her husband probably would sail from Halifax for Bermuda on Feb. 26 . She was accompanied to the station by Sir Gerald Wiltshire and Lady Maxwell-Willshire. ?
