William Smith Culburtson and William Allen White are townmates of Emporia , Kansas . <P> Though Mr. White edits in a city of 13,000 he is famed throughout the world . Though Mr. Culburtson has been Minister to Rumania since 1925 and is a world authority on economics he is insufficiently famed among his countrymen . They might have peered at him with profit , last week , as he was promoted by President Coolidge to be U. S. Ambassador at <P> Santiago , Chile , succeeding William Miller Collier of Auburn , N. Y. ( TIME , June 25 ) , and being succeeded at Bucharest by Charles Stetson Wilson , who has been Minister to Bulgaria since 1921 . <P> Peerers at Ambassador Culburtson would have seen a very flower among U. S. diplomats , not a shirt-sleever , not a spat-wearing expatriate , but a comfortable man of kindly shrewdness , a man from Emporia who walked unruffled through Rumanian intrigue , won confidence , kept respect . Minister Culburtson was in Bucharest when the late Prime Minister Jon Bratiano heard from trustworthy sources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour of Queen Marie , and despatched the secret cablegram which resulted in Her Majesty 's precipitant return .
