txt Explanation ' Cl-as made here . today of why Colonel James A. Logan . American representative on the ' Reparation Commission , has been instructed by the State Department to represent the United States Government officially in the international financial conference which wall convene at Paris on Tuesday to deal with the question of allocation of the payments to be made by Germany to the various powers under the Dawes plan . Before the lapse of another year the United States will have what it regards as a just and legal claim of close to $600,000,000 against Germany , which the latter country will hardly be able to pay unless provision is made in the reparations settlement for taking care of these payments , The exact amount of the American financial claim growing out of the war can not now be stated because it has not been definitely ascertained , but officials in a position to assess the facts have no doubt that it will exceed &300.000.000; and may run close to $600,000,000 . This claim grows out of two things  --  the use of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time the United States was participating in t:te allied regime Of occupation and American claims against Germany for losses of life and property during the war . Amount Due on Army Costs . The amount due from Germany in payment for the use of the American Army of Occupation is definite . These troops were withdrawn rrom Europe in January . 1923 , after the French invaded the Ruhr . The net amount of costs payable to Germany as of Jan. 31 , 1923 , amounts to about . $255,000,000 . In May , 1923 , an agreement was negotiated by the United States Government with the Allied powers for the reimbursement of these army costs out of- cash reparation pay  --  lents in a. prescribed manner so as to provide for the liquidation of the claim in about twelve years . This agreement Was to become effective when ratified by the French Government . The amount that will be due from Germany on account of American claims against Germany can not be definitely stated at this time for the reason that these claims are in process of adjudication by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ com. - nission will have completed its work by next Spring . The claims so far taken care of in the awards handed down by the commission . which includes a number of those in connection with the sinking of the lansitania , already aggregate more than $100.090,000 , notwithstanding that they have generally been scaled down and some claims have been rejected outright It is understood the probability is that the aggregate of all awards will not be less than $000,000,000 and may exceed that figure somewhat . ** about $205,000,000 representing the amount due for the cost of the Rhine occupation army , the total Germany has obligated herself to pay the United States will therefore approach $600.000,000 . When the American Government first took up the question of finding a practical means to meet the desires of the 1-carding Administration concerning , the reimbursement of American army costs on the Rhine . objection was raised by Some of the allied powers . Negotiations ' instituted by Secretary Hughes led to an expression by the Allies of their willingness to meet the wishes of the American Government . The British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1922 , invited the American Government to send a represeatative to meet with allied delegates in Paris to examine the question of Rhin. ) army costs , as a whole . Eliot Wadsworth . Assistant Secretary of the Treasury , was designated as the American representative . The result was . the negotiation of the so-called Wadsworth agreement under which the sum due the United States . in settlement of the Rhine army costs was to be paid in twelve annual instalments cut of future cash payments by Germany on account of reparations . It was estimated the anea.ttjes would amount to approximately 00,000.000 yearly , and it was stated officially that they would constitute a. , first charge on payments credited to Germany 's reparation account , excepting deliveries in kind , &c.; No such understanding has ever been reached with the Allies as to the payment by Germany of damages in satisfaction of American property claims on account of the war . Unless some unAocstanding is reached whereby the amounts that will be due the United States from Germany in satisfaction of these claims are taken care of out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reparations , it is argued that for many years to come they could not be paid should priority be accorded reparation payments . Now that the Dawes plan has been adopted in the effort to solve the reparation problem , and the work of the American-German Mixed Claims Commission is likely to be concluded next Spring , it Is explained that it is not only regarded by the Coolidge Administration as opportune but deemed to be its duty to bring forward in the International financial conference in Paris the desire of the United States to find a practical means for taking care of the payment of American mixed claims against Germany ; moreover , that unless such steps were taken this Government would be handicapped in the event that the question of allocation of German reparations were dealt with in the Paris conference to the exclusion of American rights . It is learned that even If there were no American war claims against Germany to be satisfied , it would . now be necessary for the American Government to participate in the Paris conference . The Dawes plan provides for dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reparations , and the l twenty-year annuity plan for payment of the American Rhine army cost worked out in the Wadsworth agreement does not , it is understood , exactly fit into this plan . Consequently , the Wadsworth agreement also will be taken up for discussion by Colonel Logan . Officials in Washington were aware when the Dawes plan was drafted that the Wadsworth army cost agreement did , not wholly fit into it . The attitude of the United States is understood to have been that it did not care to NS reek the plan merely to make it conform to the Wadsworth agreement , and consequently decich , d to find a practical way at some later time for modifying the anny cost agreement so as to have it harmonize with the Dawes plan foe settlement of the whole in triva te mid Difficult problem of reparations . To put it in another way , the situation in which the American . Government found itself after the formulation of the Dawes plan ' was one in which , after the " cards had been dealt " under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around in the Dawes plan . The ' Dawes plan dealt on4y with the sums to be paid Germany tot rem . rations and methods of collection and payment . The London conference which ' adopted it decided to leave to a subsequent conference of allied Ministers of Finance , the question of the allocation of these payments . Experts of the Ministries of Finance will meet in Paris on Tuesday to study the subjects of this allocation . Later the allied Ministers of Finance will meet to dispose clefnitely of the matter . In the peace treaty between the United States and Germany . Signed at Berlin on Aug. 23. 1921. the United States , in Article 2 Paragraph 4 , wan careful to obtain die agreement of the German Government to this provision : That , while the United States is privileged to participate in the Reparation Commission , according to the terms of Part VIII . of that treaty . and in any other commission established under the treaty or under any agreement supplemental thereto , the - United States Is not bound , to participate in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless an understanding is reached between the United States and the allied powers by which American awards by the Mixed Claims Commission can be taken care of In the allocation of German reparation payments , the Washington Government might , if priority were given to payments to the Allies , find itself compelled to pay American claimants out of sequestered German property or let the claims account run on in , definitely and until many of the claimants were dead . The fund now - held by the American Government to the credit of the Alien Property Custodian growing out of the sequestration of private property of German citizens in this country during the war aggregates about *300.000.000. ?
