txt The United States will be obliged to return to Europe and join an international association , Georges Cletnenceau said at the conclusion of a seventy-five-minute address at the Odeon this afternoon , in which he reviewed the objects of his mission to this country . " You will be obliged to come some way or another , and you had better take care that it will not be too late , " ho warned . The Tiger asserted that unless America came back to Europe historians would put a blot on " the best pages of your history " by saying our actions since the war proved that we regretted having gone to war for ideals . At another point in his address he urged that America give up the policy of isolation , saying : " You ca n't keep aloof . You 'Ve grown faster than your ideals , but I want to tell you that you 're loved everywhere . " Praise for Wilson . " The Fourteen Points , " he declared , " were the glory of America . The treaty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I want to say that President Wilson worked well and earnestly . " The speaker made it plain that he was not urging this country to join the League of Nations ? " Society of Nations . " he called it . He confessed that he did not regard it as a preventive of war and that he looked upon it as an ideal to he realized in the future rather than the present . Upon this subject he explained his position more fully than in the other three important addresses he has delivered thus far in this country . " I do not come to ask pity . I do not want to get your money , " he said . " Your pity ; your protection , your help ? I want nothing . I want simply to state the case before you , as after I am gone you may judge for yourself and do whatever you please  --  even nothing , if you think it best . " Therefore , you must understand my position the more so because President Wilson has spoken of It . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you very plainly that , though being an admirer of great ideas , I think It is a point to be considered whether great Ideas are always ready to he practiced on the common state of mind of the people . " Well , I do not believe in a Society of Nations as a way to suppress war  --  at least not now . " When man has progressed more and more I hope it will be , but I do not object to the best thing being attempted . To get even the least is sometimes worth counting . " The Society of Nations exists there , somewhere in Geneva . It has already done good . It has done talking . It has ' done something in the case of Austria . Mr. Lloyd George sent a telegram to one of his friends in Washington , who , I think . is a member of the Cabinet , and told him , ' You come to the Society of rations . ' " I say , if you think fit to come , you come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  French , British and Americans  --  that is my program . " If you chose to come 1 will be glad again , because I hope you will not rewithout doing anything . You know small beginnings may have great endngs . If you choose not to get into the family of a Society of Nations , that is qwq tendency to isolation allowed us , for the benefit of human ' welfare , to conquer countries and people . They were very good people and are our neignimrs . " There is a tale in an Arabian book . There is a genie in a bottle and when it is out you can not make him get in . Your case is just the other way . You are the genii . You want to be in the bottle and do not want to go out . I call you out of the bOttle . " That is the whole case . " That has been a very good point for you and for a long time I think you did well to stick to it . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to act according to It . I do not want you to dismiss it , but I want you to understand that you have grown very , very , very fast . " That very often happens with men . You have grown faster , allow me to say , than your ideals . Your feelings , of course , have become larger , and you are a very complacent people ; you arc known nil over the world . ' The phrase " damages repaired " was not only in the Fourteen Points , but in the armistice . Clemenceau went on . He Paid that he with Colonel House put them in the armistice " so we would understand it was the first thing to be done . " " If the armistice was a manifestation of American spirit , " he continued , r the treaty of peace ; was also , because there was no man who worked with a better heart than President Wilson . " Again there was applause , and the reception to the reference to ' Wilson amounted almost to a demonstration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to say . " It is juet that I should saw so . 1 de net interfere with American politic . I am happy enough to know nettling about them . And I am not so sure , after all , there is such a division as they think between Republicans and Democrats . We know very o-ell that there was none at the time American soldiers went to France . Nobody asked them whether they were Democrats or Republicans . " But now , the question Is. what is the matter with America. ? I do not know . It all depends upon you . I have no right to Interfere in your own business and I do not want ( se T found such difficulties in interfering in other people 's affairs . I can show you where , as a private citizen , I think is your duty . but I will soy no more . So . when T hear , ' You wo n't brings us hack to Europe , ' I say , that Is your business . Why do you say it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a.mone yourselves . Well , it is true . I want you to go back to Europe and see the situation that you will find . Why ? esecause you wont the first time and left before the work was over . That is the whole thing in a nutshell . " Thu were net obliged to go in 1 ( 117 . If you had not gone , well , I ' would be sorry for you : but , after all , the world would not wonder . But having gone , then I come and ask you , ' That did You go to war for ? ' That must he knOwn , because if you have obtained your aim , if you have done what you wanted to do , then I have no reason to ask you to come back , in a diplomatic manner .

It will he interpreted in that way . America disinterested herself as to the question of . whether it would be safe for democracy . I want you not to pronounce such a word that would be a condemnation of your past and your title to glory in the future . " Clemenceau 's welcome as he drove through St. Louis streets this afternoon on his way to the Odeon equaled any that he has received since his arrival in this country . Despite the large German population , the downtown streets were packed with people , and France 's wartime Premier was heartily cheered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned over to the police . but no unpleasant incident occurred during the day . The arrangements made by the committee in charge of Clemenceau'sd reception proceeded like clock-work . Seemingly no detail had been overlooked . The committee had read of occasions in Other cities where the veteran French statesman was hustled up long flights of stairs and they saw to it that no such exertions were forced upon him today . Leaving the country home of Joseph Pulitzer , his host , he was driven for an hour through the parka and residential portion of the city . A stop was made at Washington University , where there was a picturesque setting , with students banked on the steps of the main building . Clemenceau did not leave his car , but the under-graduates almost cheered their lungs out . Another stop was made at St. Louis University , where there was another noisy greeting . Above the demonstration floated an army blimp . Clemenceau left late tonight for Baltimore . He is due there Monday morning and will leave that afternoon for Washngton . ST . LOUIS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington University today Clemenceau got his first public kiss of the tour . Miss Delphine Davenport of Louisiana , Mo .. presented the visitor with a large bouquet of American beauties . Clemenceau thanked her and extended a gray-gloved hand , but Miss Davenport climbed on the runnintaboard of his car and kissed him spare on the fps . Photographers who. missed it encouraged her to repeat it , while the Tiger smiled broadly , era ; s Clemenceau spoke of the American tit  --  isions that fought id France . " What did they do it for and why did they do it ? " he asked . " For two " leeks I have been addressing the American people . dri these Questions . And today I would like to make a kind of summing up of the whole case . " Summarized , Clemenceau 's points were these : . 1 . Charges ' of French Militarism -- France has been invaded by Germany . twice within forty-five years , and if she is not supported by other nations she trust defend herself alone ; France has to money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . 2 . France 's Debt to America  --  It will be paid , but France has- no money , and O. friend should not ask ? another to repay a loan at the very time it is known he ca n't pay it . a . Reparations : a fifth of France 's productive capital is lost ; Germany has been relieved of 57 per cent . of her obligations and is being encouraged in her refusal to pay by America 's withdrawal from European affairs . 4 . Participation by the ** States in European questions : the armistice and treaty were American documents . and the United States left before the work was over without making any conditions under which she would return . 5 . Society of Nations ; League of Nations , Association of Nations . call it what you will . participate actively or Passively , but join some form of international entente . " My desire is to make it clear for everybody , " Clemenceau said . ? ' We made war together . We did not make peace together . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We fought . won victory And then took the trouble to discuss the treaty and write lt . It was signed by your and my country and then the treaty was broken . The French were left alone with the British to face it . " ins feet , to tell the truth , there was another thing that was unpleasant to me . We owe you money . It is a veryunpleasant situation , even though we are very glad to owe it to you rather than anybody else , on condition that we mean to pay it , of course . " We spent it on the fields of battle . It was not lost money for anybody , and It was spent for the common cause , but for our account . Now , some Frenchman acid , ' We will settle- the matter with America by net paying our debts . ' I do not know whether it was a joke or not , but if it was a. joke , it was a bad one . Now , I understand America resented it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her place , but , altheugh I am not in a Government position , t em sure that denials came at first from the people interestect . " That debt  --  of course it will be psaihut my friends , if you lend a. friend any sum . do you choose to go and ask l%im for the money at the very time you know he ca n't pay it ? I think not . Well , that was our case . Clemenceau then turned to a discussion of charges of French militarism. first made indignant by an interview attributed to Rudyard attaeds ! ma America 's part in the war , the Tiger said that this together with statements eminating from this country that France is militaristic and imperialistic decide ... him to come here to refute them . " And so I took my hat and cane , and here I am , " he said . The United States has the best frontiers in the world , France has been ineaded by Germans since the Roman Times he went on . " I do not intend to interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you interfered in mine , and without interfering with yours I am inclined to say that sometimes you were vary much inclined toward the developemelt of your military establishment . The other day you said that you could not be unprotected and that you had to here 500,000 tons of warships . That may 1311 . T will give you a million if you want it . It is a way of spending and wasting your money which is , of course , at your disposition . " For the present you must understena that after Ulla- time spent going through America 1 feel quite comforted to see that nobody has flatly contradicted my sayings . I do not see any paper that lesists we are militaristic . They also do us the honor to say that we are not the people who are not going to pay our debte . Therefore , if it is not presuming on my part  --  I 1V7 .... 9 very presumptuous ts , come  --  I feel as though I have- gained these two points . " I hear that there is one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very ' see about which I would like to say a few words . " First , I have to say how this situa. - Won was brought about . We made peace ender new conditions that had never been seen before in the world , and these esere owing to America . President Wil- I Fon onme out with his Fourteen Points . " This was Clemenceau 's first reference in his address to ex-President Wilson , and applause swept through the hall . ? ' T think the Fourteen Points deserve 1 epplaude. " he said . " It was the very first time that a fighting people had gotten the better of their aggreasion and they were able to say what they were fighting for . " " What were those Fourteen Points for ? Pleadings set forth before ail humankind . They came from America , and you may be proud that this armistice and treaty had at their front the Fourteen Points , which were nothing but the translations of the Declaration of Independence . says We Should Take Care . " You can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . It seems to the some are eery selfish . They say we will make our home comfortable , we will build ! walls , we will not admit strangers and we will live there and he happy . You did not say that in ' 76 , and if you had said it in ' 70 I do not know what the consequences would have been . say , take care . A people can not be great one way and small another . A country can not be great and appeal to the ideals 1 of mankind one day and then the next ! .. WhatAloeft-that mean ? . I do
