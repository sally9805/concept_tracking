Since 1880 six men have been president of the Pennsylvania Railroad . They were : Roberts , 1880-1897 Thompson , 1897-1899 Cassatt , 1899-1906 McRea , 1906-1913 Rea , 1913-1925 Atterbury , 1925- Fifth on the list in point of time , but not of stature , is Samuel Rea , who died last week in his home at Bryn Mawr , suburb of Philadelphia . Of him said Frederick D. Underwood , onetime ( 1901-26 ) president of Erie Railroad : " I have known four presidents of the Pennsylvania preceding Mr. Rea ... he stood head and shoulders above them all . " <P> Tremendous , indeed , were the changes in the Penn system during the 50 years in which Mr. Rea was associated with it . He began as a rodman in 1871 , at a time when the Penn road had hardly outgrown its original ( 1846 ) charter which provided that it should extend from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh . Not only did he see the road pass through the greater part of the expansion which has made it a 12,000-mile system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured access to Manhattan . He planned a bridge across the Hudson from Jersey City to Manhattan . When other roads refused to cooperate , he went under instead of over the water and built the Hudson River tubes . Later he made an arrangement with the New York , New Haven &; Hartford and built the Hell Gate Bridge , and still later got control of the Long Island Railroad and connected it to the Penn with tunnels under the East River . <P> In his later years , as head of a great railroad , Mr. Rea was not only rail tycoon but public figure as well . Thus many a person knew that he belonged to the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment , that he supported Alfred Smith in the late campaign . He was famed , too , as a woodchopper and as a collector of English antique silver . Doubtless many of the thousands who this week passed through Manhattan 's Pennsylvania Station realized that in it Samuel Rea has an enduring and a fitting memorial .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
