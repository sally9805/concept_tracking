" I was a judge in the Criminal Session , but I resigned , " Mr. Fuchs replied . " Were you interested in tile passage of the Sunday sports bill ? " " Very much . " " What measures did you take for the completion of the sports act ? " " I did everything I could to see that the council passed the act as the mandate of the people called for . I talked with three members of the council  --  President Green , Mr. Ward , whom I have known for three or four years , and Councilor Murray . " " What conversation did you have with Mr. Green , president of the council ? " " A number of conversations having to do with his efforts to secure a majority vote to carry out the mandate of the people . " Reminded of High Court 's Order . " Did you discuss the composition of the council and what each man would undoubtedly do ? " Mr. Fuchs objected to answering this question because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are now proceeding under an order from the Supreme Court directing you to testify . " Then Mr. Fuchs continued : " My conversation with Green was that I had told him that on Nov. 23 Councilor Lynch called on me at the Copley Plaza Hotel with Dan Cairo ' a boxing manager and - said that they had . a meeting of thirteen Councilmen , and that Green was not strong enough to put it over , although he ' was satisfied that Green had been paid by me to put it over . " " And what did Green say to that ? " Chairman Dowling inquired . " Green said a fellow like Lynch could not do a friendly gratuitous act without getting paid for it . I told Green that Lynch had stated to me that he had enough men in his group to stop Sunday baseball from being passed in the council . " Tells of Seeing Political Leaders . Asked if he arrainged the Copley Plaza meeting , Mr. Fuchs said : " The appointment I had was with Dan Carroll . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner . Inasmuch as my relations with ?

Innes , who was one of our directors and who was also one of my friends . I went to James M. Curley the former Mayor , who is also one of our directors , and to Mr. Donahue , chairman of the Democratic State Committee . I went to every one I could reach who might be able to expedite this matter . " " What did Mr. Innes tell ' you ? " asked Chairman Dowling . " Innes said he would do all he could to see that I got a square deal . " " Why did you think it was necessary after the Council had tabled this resolution to get in touch with ? Mr. Carroll ? " " Because any one who ? had the friendship of a Councillor I felt could help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Chairman Dowling to tell what took place at the Copley Plaza ; Mr. Fuchs said : " When Mr. Carroll came in with Major Lynch , I greeted them . I asked them if they wanted some sandwiches . ? They said they did . After a-while Mr. Cunningham . sec-. retary of the baseball club went out , and when he had left Dan Carroll said he wanted to explain about the Major . " ' I think he would be glad to help you , but he is tied up . ' Carroll said . Mr. Fuchs then quoted Councilman Lynch as saying : ? " I represent a block , and they . have come to the conclusion that , if this goes- through that Adams vice president of the Braves arid also owner of the Boston Bruins club of the National Hockey League will have Sunday hockey and they want to be taken care of . " Lynch then told him , Mr. Fuclls testified , that the members of the block had figured up just how many Sundays there would be for baseball , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had figured that Mr. Fuchs should pay $5,000 for each man . " I asked Lynch , " Mr. Fuchs testified , " whether he thought these fellows could go on with things like this with Mr. Foley the District Attorney I and ' Mr. Warner the Attorney General in office , and Lynch replied : ' as far as prosecut on in Suffolk County goes , it 's a joke . We draw our own jurors . " It , was this reference to jury-drawing that interested Attorney General ' Warner . Ten Council Members Named . ?

Motley , Wilson and Mahoney . ? " I informed ' Lynch that such a proposition was both comical and ridiculous , " Mr. Fuchs testified " that he and the rest of the group he represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without horses . " Then , he added , Mr. Lynch told him that , the ! block " could table the Sunday sports order until he changed his attitude . " I did not take the thing seriously till the day the resolution was tabled , " Mr. Fuchs concluded , " and I saw that the ' very men ' who voted against it were the ones that had been previously mentioned to me . " Under cross-examination by Joseph P. Walsh , who appeared as counsel for . Mr. ' Lynch , Mr. Fuchs admitted telling Mr. Lynch and Mr. Carroll that he was . under a severe strain and that he had come to ' Boston with a'lot of money and it was nearly all One .
