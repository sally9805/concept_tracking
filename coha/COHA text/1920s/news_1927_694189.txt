The meeting was well attended and the liveliest in years . Following address of Edward G. Buckland , vice president , the meeting developed into somewhat of an uproar with a number of stockholders attempting to speak at the same time and voicing opposition to the plan . Vice President Buckland made it clear that New Haven 's hand was really forced by the Treasury Department in adopting a refunding plan at this time . He said that on June 1 the New Haven had been notified by the Secretary of the Treasury , who is also the director general of railroads. , that the Treasury had been approached by Edward L. Stokes of Philadelphia to purchase $43,000,000 The Secretary wanted to know if it would be possible for the New Haven to take up this note June 1 . Mr. Buck:and replied that it would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort would be made to do so as soon as a plan could be ' worked out . Treasury accordingly extended the time until October 15 , 1927 . The Secretary of the Treasury wanted this note paid so that the proceeds could be applied toward reduction of the second Liberty loan on November 1 , 1927 . Mr. Buckland stated that the Treasury had already disposed of $4,000,000 of notes to Edwin L. Stokes some time ago without notification to the New Haven Railroad leaving $60,000,000 of notes which could be sold to outside parties . Of this , $43,000,000 if sold could not be called until maturity . E. G. Buckland , vice president , in explaining purposes of the preferred stock , said : " A few stockholders have asked if the preferred stock issue should not be recommended , requiring dividcots ahead of . the common stock at the rate of 1 ' 1 more than the interest being paid on the company 's debt to the got crnmant  --  whether there should be this preference over the common stock . " The shortest nod most direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payable if earned is a Imm , less preference than the existing 6 ' 3- notes secured by its first and refunded mortgage bonds pledged at S5 ; that through the preferred stock issuance this preference is not only lightened but stockholders are given an oppor tunity to make an investment in a stock whose divides I requirements have been during the pant two years earned times over . ' Proceeds of this stock issue wi:1 now be devoted to paying off the company 's indebtedness to the Government . bearing interest at the rate of to reduce its mortgage secured indebtedness by that amount and so improve capital structure by increasing proportion of stock to bonds from one-third stock to two-thirds bonds as at present , to more than 43 ' ; stock anc less than 57 ' 1 bonds , which will be the result of the preferred stock issue . This strengthening of capital structure will Improve credit of the company , so that the balance of its debt may he refunded at a substantially lower : ate than would be the case if it attempted to refund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons which led directors to recommend and arrange underwriting at the rate of 2 " , upon the par value of the stock to be issued are the necessity of having the entire issue subscribed and the conviction that this will not happen unless underwritten . That conviction is based , among other things , upon the difficulties of reaching all of the holders of the $39,029,000 par value of convertible ( 3 'S debentures of ** are entitled to subscribe in the same proportion to the par of their holdings as are the stockholders. and also to the difficulty of reaching large number of the owners of the stock who are apparentlyholding certificates registered in the name of other persons ( principally brokers ) and endorsed in blanks . Practicallyeme-third of the entire stock is so held . " The underwriting will provide the company by October 15. 1927 , with $43.000.000 , with which to retire the notes for that amount which the government has agieed to withhold from would-be purchasers at par . It will assure entire issue being taken and in all probability save the company substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to refund the rest of the indebtedness at a lower rate . " Mr. Buckland then recited the financial difficulties of the company since 1913 , the origin of its debt to the government , etc . He pointed out that upon all the debt to the government the company has been paying 6r ; I T. - wrest , although money has cost the government not over an average of 41.1,3 . The inequity of this charge was so apparent , he said , that application was made to Congress to permit refunding of this indebtedness upon- a basis of the cost of money to the government . The government has already made more than $10.000,000 profit from the interest paid by the New Haven , Mr. Buckland said . Congress , however , failed to act , and in the meantime improved conditions of the property lead outside bonito g interests to bring pressure on the government to sell the company 's notes at par , thereby precluding possibility of refunding at a lower rate . Offers at par for $60,000,00u of notes have been made . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called until maturity . Secretary of *leTreasury has , however , agreed to hold this note until October 15 , 1927 , and it therefore became necessary to take means for paying it at that time . Concluding , Mr. Buckllind said : " Your directors believe in present plan . They look forward to the day when with improved credit they may no longer be required to apply to improvement and betterment , which every railroad needs to serve a growing and prosperous territory , all of the earnings - available for dividends . They hope that with the continuance of normal business in southern New England the day is not far distant when a reasonable portion of those earnings may be applied to a dividend upon the common stock .
