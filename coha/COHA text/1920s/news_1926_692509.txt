txt President Coolidge and the Dominion government have each designated April 38 to 2-1'as American Forest week . Behind the action of the two governments lies this sinister fact  --  that in regard to our timber supply we have been living in a fool 's paradise . Soon and unpleasant will be the awakening unless we take instant steps to correct past blundeis . Soil erosion and dwindling streams are witnesses to our neglect of the forests . Everything that we eat , wear or otherwise enjoy is in some way connected with the product of the forests . We can not travel a mile by train or auto without testifying to our dependence upon timber . You may sit et a table and from a pulp wood paper menu order a beefsteak and trace the connection between that steak and wood . From the time the steer , in a fenced enclosure , is fed from a trough , and transported over railroad ties for its trip through the packinghouse , down to when after enjoying the steak the diner discretely picks his teeth , wood has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of national concern . and justification for the statement that we are living in a fool 's paradise is in this one fact : We are nearing the end of our virgin forests and , although consumption is four times as rapid as renewal , we are doing almost nothing about it . Fire is one serious menace , and that is inadequately guarded . against . But even ample fire protection will not alone restore the forests . There must be reafforestation coupled with fire protection to insure the timber supply of the future . A reason why this has not been done more extensively in the past is our unbusinesslike conception of taxation . A tree requires from 50 to ' 70 years to mature . yet we shut our eyes to that fact and tax growing timber at its present value as though it could be cut immediately . Timber is a crop just as much as corn or cotton , but instead of being an annual it requires a lifetime to develop for harvesting . Would it be equitable to value a crop of corn and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who raises a crop of timber must pay taxes at least 50 times on it before he gets his return . What surer sway to discourage reafforestation ?
