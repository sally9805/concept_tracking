SQUAD-James B. Wharton-Coward-McCann ( $2 ) . <P> " Christ , you ca n't tell no one how bad it is . ... How th ' hell 're you gon na tell anyone what a bullet sounds like , er a shell , an ' what it 's like to walk all night on a empty belly . . . ? " <P> Author Wharton does it by following the fortunes of that tightest of cliques , an infantry squad , on its way from the Pas de Calais to and through the front , 1918 , early summer . Nor is the squad demolished , at fell swoop , but eroded piecemeal , beginning with the Texan who caught a stray bullet before he ever reached the front , and ending-after the armistice-with the callow corporal who was clearing debris that chanced to conceal fatal explosives . Of the other six , Allen , shellshocked , deserted to the rear . Serbian Marzuluk , Pennsylvania miner , flung himself madly into a hand-to-hand skirmish raving and cursing revenge " fer it all - de hikin ' - de night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whittaker , exhausted from trench overtime , finds a peaceful garden and a passionate girl only to be called away by the platoon whistle . Jewish Waglith of the Bronx shoe-store , heard a frantic hiss- " keep low , for Christ 's sake keep low " - but too late . Novelli , " the Eye-talian " that " bin buddies for six monts now , an ' he do n't say a dozen words a mont ' , " got his on risky patrol duty , and still silent , stoical , clenched his perpetual cigaret as they littered him rear . O'Connors , Irish day-laborer , endured with cheerful garrulity until the day before the armistice . <P> Such was the individual toll , and the aggregate a nightmare of endless unnecessary tramping , digging in ( literally ) for the night , getting up and staggering on , listless , numbed , too tired to rebel . Squad is unusually graphic , authentic , damning.
