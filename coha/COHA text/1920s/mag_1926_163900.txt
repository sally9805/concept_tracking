On Sunday afternoon two weeks ago , a band of thoughtful men filed into the Forsyth Theatre in Atlanta , Ga . They were pious men ; they had been to church that morning . Deep on their fronts engraven sat public care ; in their eyes flickered determination . When all had reached their places , one arose and , assisted by a large chorus , caused the proscenium to reverberate with the swelling notes of " How Firm a Foundation , Ye Sa-aints of the Lo-ord " , with " Ro-ock of A-ages " and old-time hymns . The odor of sanctity had settled strongly upon that lay temple by the time Atlanta 's legal luminary , Lawyer Thomas E. Scott , cleared his throat and solemnly introduced the first speaker on the program . <P> This speaker was Mayor Walter A. Sims of Atlanta , who , with fitting reference to the late William Jennings Bryan , straightway declared the satisfaction it gave him to welcome to his city any movement that had for its object " the fostering of the religious beliefs of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Roscoe Carpenter of Indianapolis , was conducted to the rostrum , where he soon pronounced the purpose for which the company was gathered . <P> " We are here , " said Mr. Roscoe Carpenter , " to begin an organization to bring the people back to the honesty , simplicity and religion of our fathers . . . . The things we call modernism , modern education and evolution are all bound up in one package and we must deal with the three as one . It is the theory of evolution which has swept the country that is causing the very foundations of liberty , morals and Christianity to totter . . . . We must control the medium which controls the people , whether it be the newspaper , motion picture or what , and we must rebuild in the minds of our children the religion of our fathers . . . . We are not going to grapple with science , but we are going to work with it . True science can go hand in hand with the Bible and we do not plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country from coast to coast and from north to south , but I was able to find only one man who has the power to build into one great , master organization the forces to fight the evils which are seeking to promulgate a theory which will destroy our Government and Christianity , and that man is Edward Young Clarke of Atlanta ! " <P> It was a very affecting speech . The impressive applause came only after a more impressive hush . Then Edward Young Clarke of Atlanta spoke . He announced that the plans for the " master organization " would be ready to submit to the directors of the movement very soon , and that the first unit of the society would be in Atlanta . " After conferring with organizers in all parts of the country , " declared Mr. Clarke , " I am convinced that this will be a master organization , and I have been assured that I am working on the right lines for such an organization . " <P> He predicted that the effects of this serious Sunday gathering of thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come ; and that the establishment of headquarters in Atlanta , would mean something very significant to that city . He announced that when his plans had been ratified , a debate on evolution would be held in At- lanta 's great public auditorium as the first step toward organizing the first unit of the master organization .
