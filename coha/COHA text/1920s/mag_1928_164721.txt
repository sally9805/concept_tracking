If you wanted to organize a good " racket , " with department stores as your particular victims , you might work it out this way : Send Miss T - to New York or Chicago or Philadelphia , $300 in her pocketbook . Tell her to pick the name of some reputable citizen from the telephone book , then start an account in her name at a local bank , using the good check as a first deposit . This done , she could go shopping . For each article she buys , she gives a check , double the purchase price , asking for the balance in cash . Cautious department stores do not accept checks without investigation . Credit men telephone the bank , discover Miss T- has a $300 balance , apologize profusely and urge her to open a charge account . Graciously , she consents , moves on to another store to repeat the performance . But at 2:30 o'clock in the afternoon , before the array of checks can reach the bank , Miss T- withdraws her deposit , hastens home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you were generous , you might allow her a 25% commission on her earnings before speeding her to another city . This , as a matter of fact , is the exact " racket " with which the National Surety Co. last week charged an organized swindling ring , employing 40 girls , operating in many a U. S. city . Recent arrests in Philadelphia provided the clue . Alarmed by 140,000 claims from stores in two years , the National Surety Co. pressed the investigation .
