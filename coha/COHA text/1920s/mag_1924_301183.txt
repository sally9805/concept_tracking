One Richard Eaton ( a Harvard graduate ) , described as a newspaper correspondent of The Daily Mail , London , and Le Matin , Paris , in an interview in Manhattan , disclosed the base , black treachery of one War Lord Lon Trotsky . <P> According to Mr. Eaton , M. Trotsky has fallen in love with brown-haired , lovely Anna Naumouv , 19-year-old daughter of a Moscow storekeeper . Lon became so infatuated wth Anna that he tried recently to turn Russia over , lock , stock and barrel , to Grand Duke Nicholas , uncle of the late Tsar . All M. Trotsky wanted in exchange was passports visd for every country in Europe , so that he and his adored could flit hither and thither outside of Russia . <P> Mr. Eaton was imprisoned with " bishops , priests , princes and a drug peddler " in a Bolshevik prison for two months and undoubtedly underwent harrowing experiences . Said he : " I was arrested in Moscow on a charge of being a spy , although I have no idea where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most remarkable woman in Russia , Simanova , known as ' The Merciless , ' and the real chief of the Foreign Department . She is less than 30 years of age , beautiful , and a blonde with blue eyes . After questioning me she demanded that I confess that I was a spy . I refused and she turned to one of her assistants and said : ' He must be shot . ' . . . Again I was taken before Simanova and after expressing regret that she could not have me shot just then , sent me to the Butirik prison on the outskirts of Moscow . " <P> Cleopatra , as all the world knows , got Antony into a lot of trouble . Anna seems to be doing her worst for Lon . Next , the fascinating Simanova may well be expected to blight the happiness of Commissar Tchicherin of the Soviet Foreign office .
