Miss Ruth Rowland Nichols , Junior Leaguer of Rye , N. Y. , enthusiastic amateur aviatrix with a non-stop flight from New York to Miami to her credit , shouldered the task of promoting three clubs in New York and New Jersey , forerunners of a nation-wide chain of private and exclusive country clubs devoted to aeronautical sports . Associated with Promoter Nichols are such younger capitalists as William A. Rockefeller , William Hale Harkness , George Pynchon , George Post . <P> Last week , Polish and U. S. pilots complained .

Collyer across Europe and Asia ; 2 ) the 13 letters in the name of J. D. Rockefeller , who gave each of the globe-circlers a lucky dime ; 3 ) the 13 letters in the name of Standard Oil Co. , which " brought Mr. Rockefeller no ill luck " ; 4 ) the first letter of " Mears " is the 13th of the alphabet .
