French aristocracy has , in the main , a healthy contempt for le T. S. F. ; * but , recently , when famed coutourier Paul Poiret spoke over ether waves at Paris , he was widely listened to - for M. Poiret had a grievance . He complained - as does many a great artist who executes the commissions of a U. S. clientele - that his work is only bought , not appreciated . A sturdy U. S. comment would be : " He should worry , so long as it 's bought ! " But M. Poiret 's deep , booming voice had a note savoring of genuine anguish last week , as it reverberated from many an haut parleur. + Said he : " My name , la marque Poiret , has been damaged , my art thwarted , by American women who have not used discretion in buying or copying my creations . . . . Each robe Poiret is meant , need I say it , for one certain type of woman . Mais . . . with nasal protest les dames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often an American woman of one kind buys in their shops a Poiret gown which is not for her . . . . " Many who listened sympathized ; but wondered at what the great Poiret was driving . Of course French folk and the U. S. colony at Paris like nothing better than to hear " native " U. S. citizens belittled ; but had shrewd Paul Poiret no more in mind than to vent a trifle of honest spleen ? He had . He made mention , at last , of an intention to tour the U. S. next fall , lecturing to women 's clubs on how a U. S. woman may divine whether the imported gown of her choice is , or is not , " for her . " <P> An idea of what U. S. newsgatherers will say about M. Poiret could be gleaned from a space filler done last week by one Henry Beckett of the New York Evening Post , who hashed up half-truths thus : " In Paris M. Poiret inhabits a studio with leopard skins on the floors , frescoes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gained note as a builder of styles for fat women , and he learned about women-fat women - from umbrellas . He used to be an apprentice to an umbrella manufacturer , and he studied the lines and curves and ribs . He also turned around to look at women on the boulevards . In this he differed not a whit from other Parisian gentlemen , but he took notes . He then made sketches and sold them to dressmakers . Finally , the owner of a dress establishment gave him a job in return for a dog that M Poiret 's father gave to the dress-place proprietor .
