The doors of the centuries-old monastery in Kiev swung open , admitted a burly figure . In the dim chapel , flickering flames from the candles revealed him to be a Cheka guard . He leaned his gun against a statue , walked to a wall and snatched up a little gold lamp that had burned in front of a miracle-working ikon for 200 years . <P> A slender black-robed figure hurled himself upon the vandal . There was a slight scuffle , a slight thud and the cloaked figure of a priest lay face down on the stone floor . . . motionless . Other wraithlike figures scurried from out of the shadows and grouped themselves about the inert form . They carried him tenderly away . The guard laughed , adjusted his cap , slightly awry , swaggered out of the monastery . Soviet authorities said that 84-year-old Father Stanislav died of heart failure . <P> A larger crowd of heavily armed men stomped the mud and snow from their boots in the monastery and began to strip the church of its priceless possessions . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast out into knee deep snow , and some were marched to prison . A riot followed . . . rifles barked . . . bullets bit into the crowd . . . soldiers dug bayonets into prone figures . <P> Last week the news of the raid and the changing of the monastery to a clubhouse filtered out of Russia . The Kiev monastery , once the goal of devout Russians , now resounds to dance music . . . there is a loud speaker on the radio . . . applause for the cinema . . . ash trays are handy for members .
