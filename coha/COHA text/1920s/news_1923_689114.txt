Joint relationship " was the desirable result that would follow in the hard coal industry if mine owners granted full recognition of the United Mine Workers of America , Mr. Lewis said .

" Mr. Lewis said that once full authority were given his organization it would be able to discipline mine workers who ' had been responsible for recent unwarranted , reprehensible and unauthorized stoppings in the anthracite collieries . " He denounced all violation of written contracts by miners or by employers . Higher wages for anthracite miners now would not mean higher anthracite Prices to consumers , according to Mr. Lewis . He said the forthcoming findings of the United States Coal Commission would prove this . Rinaldo Capoellini .
