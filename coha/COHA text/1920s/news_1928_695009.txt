txt Will Rogers Gets a New Kick Out of Aviation in the West CHELSEA , Okla. , May 1 . ? I got the real kick of my life out of aviation today . Left western Kansas and flew down to Oklahoma and landed right on the old ranch I was born on . First machine was ever in there . When I was raised , I never thought there would ever be anything faster than a horse get in there . I ask you and plead with you again , you luncheon clubbers , will you please paint the name of your town on top of your building ? I will pay for the paint if you will do it . We were lost today , and all the towns in Kansas had no names we could make out till we got to Bartlesville , Okla. , who had their name out . Are you ashamed of your town ? Yours , WILL ROGERS .
