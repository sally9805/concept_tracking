In the remote , jungled landscapes of India and in the alleyways of cities of Ceylon , music can be heard . To most occidental ears such music sounds queer and ugly , as the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra would sound queer to the inhabitants of the far places . Yet oriental music did not sound ugly to Leopold Stokowski , famed insurgent conductor of the Philadelphia Symphony . In fact during a recent and extensive tour of the Far East he stood " literally hypnotized ... by music such as western ears had never heard , wildly discordant but with overtones of grandeur . " Always eager to shock the music-lovers of Philadelphia , Leopold Stokowski swore that he would carry these aboriginal harmonies home with him to Pennsylvania . <P> Last week when he arrived , alert music-listeners were in a stew of excitement . They longed to see Stokowski and to ask him to play for them the wild notes of songs which western ears had never heard before . " What have you brought us ? " they cried ; whereupon Leopold Stokowski showed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise when struck . These he said he had wheedled from the Sultan of Java . <P> Instead of notes , Conductor Stokowski offered his admirers notations which he had made upon music heard in Java . Conductor Stokowski said that he had been entertained by the good Sultan of Djokjakarta in his 15-acre palace at the wedding ceremonies of certain of the children of several of the Sultan 's 3,000 wives . At this wedding feast he had heard Javanese " gamalongs " or orchestras which he described : <P> " Instead of string and wind instruments , the Javanese produce their music with a complex system of gongs , bells and celestas , achieving a cohesion of rhythm beyond the hopes of an occidental orchestra . " Different gamalongs , said Stokowski in an awed whisper , played long , complicated programs in different courtyards without leaders and without mistakes . " I tried , " said the leader of the Philadelphia Symphony , " to arrange with a Javanese prince to send his entire orchestra of several hundred to Philadelphia . . . they are splendidly barbaric . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
