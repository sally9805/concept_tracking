Arthur Brisbane ( Hearst editor ) made the following comment on George Washington : " In three months his beer bill was $170 , French red wine $105 , porter $45 . He spent only five shillings for liquors-wise Father of His Country . If everybody had done the same ever since , there would be no drink problem in the United States . "
