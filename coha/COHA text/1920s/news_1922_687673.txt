txt Reply to Mr. Anderson . To the Editor of The New York Times : I give below a copy of a reply I have made to a communication received by me from Mr. William H. Anderson , State Superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League of New York , requesting my financial support of his organization : April 25 , 1922 . " Mr. William H. Anderson . State Supt. , Anti-Saloon League of New York , 906 Broadway , New York City , N. Y. " Dear Sir : " In replying to your favor of April 17 , which I have read and considered most carefully , I welcome this opportunity of advising Stott how I feel about the present Prohibition law . " I am unalterably opposed to your views , and those of your associates . on the liquor question and to a constitutional amendment which in my . judgment was secured by reprehensible methods . I quite agree with you that it is a serious situation when the law is not respected by our best citizens and I feel , as , do most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely rbsponsible for the present condition of affairs by forcing.upon the country-an unnatural law , which violates the sacred rights and personal liberties of its citizens . I have always opposed the saloon , and personally have little interest or desire to use any , kind of stimulants , but I stand today most emphatically for a repeal , or modification , of the present liquor law so that the people may have light wines and beer , and I shall continue to work to this end and against , the retention of the Eighteenth Amendment . which I feel can never be construed as the wish of the majority of American . citizens . " In closing I wish to make it clear that my influence and any financial support will be given your opponents whose worthy efforts are working to eliminate ? the liquor law , which in my opinion make ? law-breakers , and in its present form is a curse to my beloved country . Very truly yours . " ( Signed ) . A. RENE MOEN . " New York , May 2 , 1922 .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
