" New York is my home , and I am convinced that I can not serve the city 's interest better than by helping , to the extent of my ability , to put the university in a position to realize its splendid opportunities . I am more ready to undertake this because of the remarkable showing the university has made with very limited resaurces . The institution receives no State or city aid , and its endowment is but a pittance cornpared with the endowments of other leading universities . " Per Student Endowment Is $129 .
