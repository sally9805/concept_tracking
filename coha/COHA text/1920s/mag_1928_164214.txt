Smart , blase Deauville was almost surprised , last week , when dapper M. Andre Gustave Citroen , famed " Henry Ford of France , " sat as judge upon a male fashion parade and upon a bevy of diving Adonises . <P> Sponsored by exotic novelist M. Maurice de Waleffe were cool culottes de juillet ( Breeches of July ) much resembling the " shorts " already worn by smart U. S. males-as nether underwear . With the culottes is worn a waspish waisted jacket . Formal evening attire of quite similar cut was presented at Deauville in sheer green or violet silk , topped with a silk hat of matching hue , and completed by a nuvelle chemise-d'habille ( new dress shirt ) - soft , - collarless , and deeply " V " cut to display virile hirsute chests . <P> Judge Citroen , assisted by Baron van Zuylen and clubbable M. Andre de Four-quiers , scored the entries by a discreet system of points which admirably concealed the personal penchants , if any , of the greatest European motor man ( 150 cars a day ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunks without tops , were judged according to standard occidental notions of masculine perfection . Plump tummies , esteemed by Orientals , were ruthlessly penalized by slightly tubby Judge Citroen . <P> Fashion displays such as that at Deauville were explicitly condemned by a general pontification of last week from the Vatican 's famed semi-official news organ Osservatore Romano . Lamenting for the Globe in general , Osservatore cried : " Immorality is still vast . Sufficient proof is afforded by the Press with its audacious articles and by fashions which are ever more bold and unseemly . " <P> <P> *A standard omission at most European beaches .
