DEAR CHARLOTTE : Home again at last ? can you guess how much that means to me ? Of course , you can guess , since I have been traveling about a good deal lately , that it will be a relief ? temporarily , at least ? not to use a trunk for a bureau , and a suitcase for a desk ; and since I have had a very busy winter socially , that I shall be glad ? temporarily , at least ? not to make formal calls from four to six every afternoon , and start out to a formal dinner , followed by a still more formal reception , after a day already filled to overflowing ; that since I have been going to great conventions , thrillingly interesting to be sure , but not conducive to much repose , that I shall be glad to get away from noise and crowds and heat and welcome a little solitude . Perhaps you can guess a little more ? that the lights blazing the way up Mount Vesuvius or rippling over the harbor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half so beautiful to me as those shining from the many-paned windows of my own house to welcome me back after several years ' absence ; that the stirring strains of the Marscilloise could not move me so much as the sound of a small boy 's cart clattering under my window and the staccato of the mowing-machine over the meadows ; that it is more fun to have Prue and Lois and Mary " running over " than it would be to go to any foreign court . But I do not believe you know how much my home has meant to me in ways that count still more . You have never seen it ; you have known me only since I have been away from it much of the time ; and in asking me " how I happened to begin to write " I can see that you are entirely in the dark as to the real reasons . Like most of my journalistic friends , you see in the answer to that question nothing more nor less than an " interview " ? and most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though so friendly that they have touched and encouraged me greatly , and reasonably accurate as to the main facts , have somehow missed the underlying causes and conditions which they have sought to explain . And like most beginning writers who pour out the story of their literary troubles into my sympathetic ear , you always say sooner or later , " If I 'd only had your chance ? if I 'd only been as lucky as you were ! " There is , undoubtedly , some alchemy in the atmosphere of Pine Grove Farm . But it is not the kind you think . And securely established in the commodious serenity of the attic ? the living-room , given over to a radio , a piano , a victrola , and a mandolin , all extensively used by three boys , has somehow ceased to seem convenient for much letter-writing ? I shall try to tell you the story you have so often asked for . There is an old French proverb which was often quoted against the beautiful Eugenie when Napoleon the Third was seeking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? which runs , " Beware of the woman whose cradle has been a trunk , and whose boarding-school has been a hotel dining-room . " If that proverb is true , I am certainly a woman of whom it would be well to beware , for a trunk was my cradle before I was seven weeks old , and tables d'hete figured more prominently than blackboards in my early education . My mother was a New Yorker , born and bred , with the drawing-room of a corner house on Madison Avenue ? at that . time the center of fashion ? as her social background ; but her father ? before he went , shortly after his graduation from Dartmouth , to the metropolis to practise law and seek his fortunes , and incidentally to marry one of the reigning belles and heiresses of her day ? had come from a little village in Vermont , on the Connecticut River ; and from her paternal grandfather my mother had inherited a simple , spacious , old house in this village , which had already sheltered the members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally been settled by them ? and with characteristic New England tenacity they had clung to it . My father , the son of a struggling Congregational minister , and the descendant of a long line of clergymen , judges , and teachers who had never possessed enough worldly goods to keep the wolf from the door , came from a suburb of Boston . Equipped with an oil lamp , a five-dollar bill , and his father 's blessing , he entered Harvard University at the age of fifteen and graduated from there four years later with highest honors , and the firm determination to continue the pursuit of knowledge further and eventually to impart it to others . He succeeded in both these ambitions . After having been admitted to the bar , obtaining several high academic degrees at home and abroad , and serving as an instructor in several institutions of learning , he became the head of the Department of Greek at the University of Virginia when he was barely thirty years old . It was there that I was born , amid surroundings as thoroughly southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally belonged to James Monroe , the fifth President of the United States and the author of the Monroe Doctrine ? a beautiful old house on Monroe Hill , near the University , which still seems to me ? after having seen many ? the most beautiful in the world , and overlooking the Blue Ridge Mountains , which still seem to me ? after having seen many ? the bluest and most beautiful in existence . I had a colored mammy , Barbara , and she and our colored butler , Preston , were important factors in my childhood . I came near being christened " Virginia Monroe . " and it was only after considerable indecision on the part of my parents that I was named instead for " the best woman they knew " ? my father 's mother , Frances Parkinson , who had been a New Hampshire girl . Because the ties with the Connecticut Valley were even then so strong . I as t aken seven hundred miles for this christening , to that quiet Vermont village of Newbury which I mentioned before . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have grown up in reality , as I was technically , through the accident of birth , a Virginian . The happiest years of his life were spent at the University , among southern people ; he never would have wished to leave either ; and that I should have been completely happy there . too , I can not doubt . for I love the South dearly . But when his career , already brilliant as a classical scholar and teacher , and just beginning to take form as a classical writer as well , was cut prematurely short , there was nothing to tie my mother to one particular section of the country , or even to one particular country . My years of wandering began , and an extremely mixed environment was added to my equally mixed heredity . We usually passed our winters in Boston . and theoretically I went to school there ; but these winters were broken by trips to Washington , to Virginia , to California . and to Colorado , where my elder brother lived , and where we spent months with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summit of Mount Washington . There were two years , almost a decade apart , in Europe ; with this exception all our summers , and parts of several winters , were spent in Newbury , Vermont ; that was " home " ; the rest was merely " traveling " or " staying . " That was where I had my father 's library to rummage through at will . That was where I had the two old horses , inherited from my father and brother , to ride and drive whenever I felt like it . That was where I developed an insatiable fondness for rambling " down the lane " and over the mountains . That was where I snowshoed and coasted and skated , rode on hayloads , swam and paddled ; that was where I went to church picnics , and husking bees and corn roasts , " sugaring off " and " cousin " parties . And that was where , when I was eighteen years old , I was  | married , in the austere little church where my great-grandfather had worshipped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? over the back of whose pew I had climbed , Sunday after Sunday , when as a very small child I had first sought to relieve the monotony of hourlong sermons ; to whom a little later , at the age of six , I had written my first letter , made necessary by the horrible oversight on my part of having forgotten to thank him for " treating me " at the church fair ; from whom , ten years later , I had received my first " grown-up " bouquet , in the shape of American beauty roses on my birthday . Certainly not a hasty romance , but one which culminated in matrimony about as soon as was possible considering my age ? or , rather , the lack of it . Marriage And then , for thirteen years , my wandering ceased altogether . It is about these thirteen years that I wish especially to tell you , because they have been inaccurately described by others , to say the least . The house to which I went as a bride 1 is not , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sending you , either unattractive or uncomfortable ; indeed , it is quite the opposite ; and I never suffered any " hardships " in it . But I did have to undergo a good deal of readjustment in taking up my new life . My mother had never lifted her finger to do anything useful , and she had brought me up in the same way . Entirely lacking in preparation , I was suddenly face to face with the fact that three meals a day must be prepared and served , rooms cleaned , clothes made , mended , and washed . I had never done any of these things myself , and I had never supervised any one else in the doing of them . It was necessary to learn to do both without delay . I had never stayed very long in any one place , I did not know the meaning of the word monotony , and it was necessary to settle down , and settle down hard . Needless to say , I had had no experience with children , and before I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later a third put in an appearance . I had been used to having a " good time " in the usually accepted sense of the word ? that is , a gay time ; and I had to adapt myself to a very quiet one . My husband was away much of the time ? always half of every week , often more than that ; and when he came home , tired out , it was to face a desk piled high with the mail which had accumulated during his absence , urgent farm problems which were awaiting his return to be settled . He had several business connections ? a bank , a mill , and so on ? and he was already launched on his political career . He served for seventeen years as selectman in our town , and was successively State Representative , State Senator , and Chairman , of the State Excise Board . It was not possible for me to leave three small boys behind and go with him to the state capital , neither was it possible to move them constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the nearest village , and in winter , when the snow is piled several feet high in the driveways and the mercury hovers closely around zero , much visiting back and forth is not possible . There were weeks on end when no one entered our front door except the doctor ? and he came with amazing frequency . As I look back on it , it seems to me that among us , we had everything in the way of a physical ailment that could possibly befall S us except the bubonic plague ! The children disproved the fond belief that contagious diseases flourish only in congested districts . They had measles and mumps , chicken pox and whooping-cough , with all possible complications ; they had their ears pierced and their tonsils and adenoids removed , and  | strange , mysterious growths taken from their throats and knees . Not to be outdone by them , I had several operations myself , of a far more serious character ? there were sixteen of them in all , neatly divided among us . When my first baby was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and during the following summer , while I was nursing him , the burns , which were excruciatingly painful , had to be dressed twice a day . When the first epidemic of " flu " came , we all had it at once ? my husband with pneumonia throw n in for full measure ? with only one faithful maid to take care of us as best she could , the nearest doctor miles away , and no nurse available ? for that epidemic came in war-time , as you may remember , and every doctor and nurse who could go to France had gone . When Harry was inaugurated Governor , I was lying in a dark room , suffering intensely , and perfectly well aware that the two nurses and three doctors who were with me felt very uncertain as to what the outcome of that suffering would be . And the aftermath of that illness was so long , and so dreadful , and so insidious , that the scars of it , as well as the scars of the burn ' to which I referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My Life at Home I recently read a review of my new book , published in one of the big New York papers , which was favorable on the whole , but which said that my outlook on life was so invariably rosy that it became somewhat monotonous , though it was undoubtedly sincere ? that I was unable to see the dark side of either events or persons , partly because I was constitutionally happy , and partly because nothing had ever happened to me to make me otherwise . I read that review with mingled feelings of amusement and triumph . For though I have undoubtedly obtained a rosy outlook , I am ashamed to say that I did not always have it . I did not always have it in those early years of my marriage , as I read my morning mail ? a letter from my mother in some bright European capital , full of chatter about pretty new dresses , and the latest operas , and lighted boulevards ; a letter from my dearest friend , living in a gay little city , going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked out of my window at a blinding sheet of snow and realized that it would be days before I could leave my own piazza ? and rebelled . I did not always have it when I realized how nurses ' and doctors ' bills were eating into an income which under normal circumstances should have been sufficient for all reasonable needs ; that little luxuries would have to be given up , and then some of the less essential comforts , and then ? what ? I had no more help in the big house than was absolutely essential ; I did part of the work regularly myself ? when I was not flat on my back ? and " filled in " with the other parts whenever it was necessary . I made my own clothes and the children 's , I often mended stockings and sewed on buttons sitting propped up in bed ; I spent nothing on amusements ; and still there was not enough to meet them . . . I did not have it when for months on end I did not get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick child , wondering , some of those nights , with a clutching terror , whether , the next night , I would have him to take care of . I did not have it when I lay in bed for months on end myself ? once for a whole year at a stretch ? conscious not only of those bills piling up and those household duties neglected , but of precious hours of companionship with husband and children slipping past , lost forever , and still with no assurance of better health or greater prosperity ahead . It was only when that darkest hour of all came , the hour which , by a curious chance , was the greatest that had come to my husband -- that of his inaugural -- when I knew that I must " let go " altogether or go on somehow , that I struggled back to health and happiness again , and learned to hang on , like grim death , to both .  | I do not present this part of the story as anything unusually hard ; many women go through trials , both physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more successfully ; but I do want to show you , so that you may not be discouraged in pursuing your own literary career , that the " luck " which surrounded my own first attempts consisted of a badly shattered constitution and absolutely no special educational training . - And , at the same time , I have been telling you ? though you probably have not been aware of it how I " learned to write . " I learned to write standing beside my grandmother ? the first Frances Parkinson ? before I could even read , when she taught me chapters and chapters of the Bible by heart , and gave me , as her everlasting legacy , a deep religious faith and at least a fair command of the English language . I learned to write in a primly beautiful little city in Switzerland ? and no less in the simple office of a mining-engineer in Colorado . I learned to write from a Jesuit priest whom I never saw but once , and who taught me , in the course of one long , wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than my Latin teacher in Boston taught me in three successive winters . I learned to write from my eldest son when , woefully unprepared , I began to teach him myself because there was no one else at hand to do it for me . I learned from working in the village library , and acting in the village dramatic club , and sewing in the village church-guild . In short , I learned as any one can learn who wishes to ? from the persons with whom I was thrown , and the surroundings in which I lived . These vary , of course , in every individual case , but the opportunities which they offer prove in the end surprisingly equal . Have you any idea , I wonder , how often I have envied you the chance ? the " hick , " if you like ? which you had and I did n't ? regular , systematic schooling ; a college course ; post-graduate work ; and through it all an even routine of living and superb health ? My Debt to the Valley But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to write " here in the Connecticut Valley , in those first thirteen years of my marriage , when I was not always successful in maintaining a " rosy outlook , " and which I now look back upon as the most valuable I could possibly have had to prepare me for writing or anything else . Hills and rivers , meadows and mountains , give largely of their serenity and strength to any one who will take the gifts they offer , and they give even more in the long , undisturbed periods when they are white with snow and ice in the stillness of winter , or brown and gold with the peace and fulfillment of autumn , than when they are gay with the blues and greens of summer-time . In my case they gave me much more ; they gave me the dearest friends I have on earth , and an unusually close communion with my own children . They gave me a hearthstone and an outlook and a shrine . They taught me the difference between true and false values ; to hate scandal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read and pray . I learned how to write in their midst , because I learned how to live . I do not think I fully realized this until one evening not long ago when two friends were talking with me about an article which I had written and which they liked . One of them asked me how long it had taken me to write it . " Two evenings , " I said , after a moment 's consideration . " You are wrong , " the other friend said : " it took you more than thirty years . Your whole life went into the making of that article . " So much for the way I " learned to write " ? if , to a certain degree , I have learned ? and the " luck " which attended the process . And now to answer your third question ? how I actually began . Well , I actually began at the age of seven , when I wrote a pageant in  | twelve scenes ? ore for every month in the year ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house in Boston ! The friend who was my co-star in this notable production kept the manuscript and showed it to me a few years ago , when the discussion as to whether ten-year-old Daisy Ashford could actually have written " The Young Visiters " was at its height . The pageant is almost totally lacking in punctuation , and the spelling in it is considerably simplified , but both idea and action are perfectly coherent . In Print at Last/ From that time I went straight on . A few gems of thought ? in verse ? of decidedly belligerent nature , were published in the local weekly at the time of the Spanish War , when I was twelve . A few more ? also in verse ? of a more sentimental turn were written , and concealed with great care , a few years later . The natural shyness which I felt about these was increased a good deal by the fact that my gay and pretty mother lived in constant dread that I might turn out a " bluestocking , " and that my fiance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the belief that authors almost invariably starved in garrets . I wrote with increasing frequency , but I stowed away what I wrote ? in bureau drawers , in the backs of old desks , between the pages of books that were never read . If I had been planning to rob a bank , or run off with somebody else 's husband , I could hardly have carried out my nefarious schemes with a guiltier conscience or a greater effort toward secrecy . And then fate , or providence , or whatever you choose to call it , took a hand . It usually does . The editor of a magazine published in New York wrote to me . It was not much of a magazine ? a periodical financed by a group of wealthy women as a channel to give publicity to their pet propaganda during the war , printed on heavy , expensive paper , and issued at the cost of twelve dollars a year " to subscribers only . " The editor did not write to me on account of my literary aspirations , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me as the wife of the Governor of New Hampshire , because he was writing to the wives of all the Governors , to ask them their opinion on the subject of war-time mourning . I found his letter in a pile of miscellaneous correspondence waiting for me on my desk when I came home , very late and very tired , after gleaning the countryside all day and half the night for subscriptions to Liberty Bonds . I read it through without much interest . Then I tossed it into the scrap-basket and went to bed . But something ? the aforementioned fate or providence , without doubt ? made me get up ' gain and fish it out . I turned the letter over and wrote on the hack of it , in pencil , exactly what I thought , addressed a fresh envelope , e nd the next morning sent it off and promptly forgot all about it in the further pursuit of fonds , the observance of food conservation , : he teaching of surgical dressings , and the e nitting of khaki-colored sweaters , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not afford to subscribe to the magazine n question , even if I had been invited to do ; o ? a necessary preliminary with this unique publication . It was not until several weeks ater that a Boston friend , who was making ne a visit , recalled the incident to me . " I liked that little article of yours that was printed in the Chronicle , Frances , " she said usually . " The idea is taking , too . It 's a ; ood one . " " What article ? " I gasped . " What Chronicle ? What idea ? " She produced it . She was sufficiently high-life , " you see , to be able to subscribe o the magazine , and she had brought her copy  | with her . I read with astonishment the pages she spread out before me . The opinions of about forty persons , more or less well-known , were quoted under the general heading , " The Pride and Form of Mourning . " And wedged in between Laura E. Richards and Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing black garments as a badge of sorrow is one so long and so firmly established that many persons find , for this very reason , that conventional mourning is an actual shield in times of grief . A woman plainly dressed in black is not urged at all times to take part in various activities and gaieties , and the sympathy of every one who meets her immediately goes out to her . Whereas a woman dressed in colors , though she may be in the deepest need of consolation , is constantly forced to explain her depression and apologize for her seclusion , as well as to explain her course of action in not showing a public mark of respect to her dead . " Aside from this fact ? that mourning does often protect and console its wearer ? it has very little to commend it . It is very depressing , especially in its effect on children ; it is expensive ; it is heavy and unhealthful . " The pioneers of every new movement are obliged to endure criticism , and those who advocate abandoning crepe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adopt some form of decoration ? a cross of distinctive shape , a little flag barred with black , or even a star ? which combines the religious and patriotic sentiment ? which all those who have lost some one dear to them through the war should be entitled to wear ? " The Editor Writes Again " The next time that editor writes to you , " Elizabeth said when I told her how narrow an escape from oblivion this contribution had had , " do n't throw his letter in the scrap- basket . " " He probably wo n't ever write to me again , " I answered . But he did . He wrote to me , before the publication of the magazine was finally abandoned , a good many times . The second time he again asked for an expression of opinion ? on playing bridge in war-time -- and again I found his letter late at night . It had lain unanswered several days , as I was away from home when it came , attending the launching of a wooden ship which I christened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I noticed that my response must be in New York within two days , if it was to be included in his symposium . I went and woke up the hired man , and asked him if he would drive to Woodsville ? seven miles away ? with a letter to catch the express which left at two o'clock in the morning . " Gim me it , " he murmured drowsily , extending his hand through the crack in the door which he had discreetly opened . " It is n't written yet . But it will be , by the time you 're dressed . " This time the little article was not only published ; it was copied . A. fortnight after its appearance , a scathing satire on it appeared in The New Republic . Still a fortnight later , the Literary Digest reprinted it in full with some kindly words of praise . With profound . bewilderment , I realized that a number of persons must have read what I had to say , some because they had liked it , and some because they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided that if I could get into print when I did not mean to , I had better see what I could do when I did mean to . I had very little idea how to go about it . I had no encouragement at home ; I had no literary acquaintances . I had not the vaguest idea how to approach an editor . But with the help of the hired man ? the same hired man who had suffered himself to be sent to Woodsville ?  | I put together an old writing-machine which I found in the attic ? a wheezing , grinding , old thing almost as big as a Ford ? and began to experiment on it . The ultimate result of these first experiments was a short article about my grandmother , and with a good many palpitations I sent it off to the editor of our own little state magazine , the Granite Monthly , hoping for the best and fully expecting the worst . His prompt reply did much to obliterate the impression which I had somehow gained that an editor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entirely surrounded by j copious scrap-baskets , and safely hedged in by barbed wire through which it would be extremely difficult for a would-be author to climb . " My dear Mrs. Keyes , " he wrote : " Yours , with the article relative to your 1 grandmother , Frances Parkinson , is just now received . I shall be glad to use the same in j the next issue of the glad Monthly not only because of its biographical and historical interest , but because of its literary excellence , it being extremely well-written . " My First Real Work From the time that letter came , not a single day passed that did not find me sometime , even if it were only for ten minutes , pounding away on the old typewriter ? late at night , early in the morning , during children 's naps , between Liberty Loan drives . Some writers will tell you ? and their opinion is borne out by their own experience ? that the only way to begin is by attempting at once to penetrate to the large magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort . I felt terribly sensitive and shy . The only way that I could seem to proceed was by writing simple little articles and verses on subjects with which I was familiar , and sending them where I thought they might have an even chance of a welcome . Most of the verses , both grave and gay , were ' about the war ; one of them , called " The Soldier 's Wife , " was reprinted this last winter , on request from a number of its subscribers , by a periodical far more important than the one in which it first saw the light . Many of the articles were biographical and historical essays published in the Granite Monthly . Several years later , when George Washington University gave me my degree of Doctor of Letters , these articles counted more than anything else I had written ? so the President told me ? in determining my eligibility for it . The longest way round is very often the shortest way home , and the opinion which I have always held , that it is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep and winding it is , because it so often leads to the highway of heart 's desire , was considerably strengthened by these early experiences . And all the time I was getting a little less frightened , and a little more hopeful , and the thought of all those manuscripts which I had been hiding away became more insistent ? especially the thought of a story , jotted down largely while I was nursing my third baby story whose scene was laid in a little village on the Connecticut River ? the kind of village , though not the actual village , which I knew so well . At last , one day , during a brief visit to Boston , I summoned up enough courage : o walk into a well-known publishing house and ask to be told how to achieve the mechancal process of submitting a book manuscript . An astonished but courteous clerk , after a light delay , ushered me into the presence of me of the members of the firm , who regarded one with unconcealed amusement ; but after a few minutes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information I sought , he suggested that I should send him the story when I had revised and typewritten it . That was the spring when my husband , hen Governor of New Hampshire , announced is candidacy for the Senate , and the wife of an  | official so placed has plenty to keep her busy without attempting to achieve a career herself on the side , especially if she has three children . Moreover , though I was growing physically much better , there were still many days when I was not able to get up . But I loved to write , loved it so much ? as I still do ? that I could be completely happy at any time , and for any length of time , with a stubby pencil between my fingers and a ruled copybook beneath them ; and I had the real incentive of wanting to help the family in a financial sense , if I possibly could . Why do we hear so much about the evil that money does , and so little about the good ? Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so little about the talent which has gone to waste because it had nothing to spur it on ? The most brilliant young woman I know will , I am very much afraid , never fulfil the destiny as a writer , which seems to me so easily within her grasp , because she has a large independent income upon which no inroads need to be made except to adorn and amuse herself . If those heavy doctors ' bills of which I spoke would have paid themselves , if politics had been as profitable as the persons who know nothing about it seem to imagine , if children 's educational advantages grew on trees , no matter how much I loved to write , I doubt whether I should have unearthed that story from its hiding-place that particular summer , and typewritten it , by slow degrees , whenever I could snatch a few minutes to myself . It took me a long time until early fall . But at last I finished it and sent it off ? and ten days later came a skinny little letter , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted ! My Pledge of Loyalty This letter did not reach me at night , as the ones from the editor of the Chronicle had done , but early one morning when I was starting off to an all-day meeting of the County Grange , with a picnic lunch for noontime . It was not until early evening that I had a moment to myself . Then I took the letter , and went out into one of our pine groves , and sat there , with it spread out in my lap , for a long time . I knew ? or , rather , I felt ? that there was no longer any doubt that writing would be my trade for the rest of my life . But I felt that it was much more than a trade ? it was a trust , a trust given to me by the people of the Connecticut Valley , who had made all my writing possible , but especially the writing of that story , " The Old Gray Homestead ; " to the people everywhere else who might read whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting there alone in the twilight , to myselfor to the valley ? or perhaps it was to God ? to do as well as I could with that trade and that trust ? not as well as some one else could do , of course ; not as well as I should like to do ; not as well as I hoped to do sometime ; but the very best I could ; and therefore that I would never consciously write anything that was unkind or inaccurate ; that I would never write carelessly , or hastily , or maliciously ; without joy or without prayer . So , in due time , the book came out , dedicated to " The farmers , and their mothers , wives and daughters , who have been my nearest neighbors and my best friends for the past fifteen years , and who have taught me to love the country and the people in it . " And that is how I " began to write .

I was not asked thi question until I had done a good many thing in the selection of which I had no voice , which is entirely as it should be . But at last som one did , and I answered him so quickly tha he nearly fell over backward ? because , you see , I had that answer ready and waiting :  | " I want to write letters to my old friends , which women like them everywhere can read . I want to take my life just as I live it now , full of pleasure and opportunity , and useful and inspiring contacts with men and women who are doing big things , and tell them all about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ignorant ? quite the contrary .

And that is why , when you tell me that the letters " sound real , " it makes me smile ? because they are real ! Prue and Mary , Elizabeth and Lois , and all the others are just as real as you are . When I mention something they have said , or answer questions they have asked , I am quoting from letters they have really written me And the women whom I do n't know , but who I hoped might also like the letters , write me , too ? from all over the United States ? from Europe ? from China ? from Labrador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time , and I am so glad of it ? so glad to feel that from the Connecticut Valley , and because of the Connecticut Valley , I can reach out to them always , wherever they may be .  |
