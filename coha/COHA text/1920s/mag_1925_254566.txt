Some months ago a group of scientists began in London to work upon a series of experiments whose object they carefully guarded . All were eminent specialists and it was known that they had been funded by the Government-two facts which nourished the outlandish conjectures that soon began to rise around the operations they were conducting with such industrious secrecy . Suddenly it was reported that they had made a discovery . What this was , no gossips could accurately say . All agreed , however , that it was something of vast moment-epochal , recondite , revolutionary . Some averred that these men of science had devised a terrific explosive , others that they had found a way to harness the electron . Wild fellows even declared , in a parched whisper , that they had made a synthetic man . <P> Months passed . It became clear , for all the absurd extravagance of public rumor , that something unusual was afoot . Last week Mr. John Edwin Barnard , Hon. Secretary of the Royal Microscopical Society , permitted his name to be attached to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated the cancer germ ... A minute disturbance in a ray of light revealed by the most intricate methods of microscopy ever devised ... Highly satisfactory experiments upon mice , in whose tissues , inflamed with coal tar , the injected cancer organism produced both sarcoma and carcinoma* . . . Experiments in far too early a stage to warrant any gabble about a cure for cancer . . . Further report to be issued shortly . . . . <P> Such were the words of Mr. Barnard , a man far too human to say more , too kind to raise the hopes of those men in whose bodies burrow those minute , obscure carriers of death . But to medical men his clipped announcement made the fantastic whispers that had come to them seem duller than the garrulities of a midwife . <P> * There are two varieties of malignant tumor : the sarcomata , arising from connective tissues ; the carcinomata , arising from epithelial tissues . It is customary to describe them both as cancers .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
