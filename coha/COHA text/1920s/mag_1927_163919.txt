Last week a Negress , Mrs. Mary McLeod Bethune , talked to the Women 's City Club of New York . She talked about the members of her race who have migrated . <P> " In the North Negroes live in segregated districts . . . high rents , lack of sanitation , breaking down of family life . . . . When a Negro leaves the South he leaves his skill behind . He must take a job of a different kind . . . there is no cotton to pick in the North . . . . The bulk of the Negro population is still in the South . . . they must be tended at their source . . . 8,000,000 ... a staggering problem . . . . " <P> The neat women of the City Club listened with attention . Mrs. Bethune had been introduced to them as the " world 's foremost Negro woman educator . " They had been told of her life-how she was born in a log cabin on a rice farm , how with her husband and son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palatka , Fla. , where she taught in school , and sang " with unusual effect " in churches . All the time she wanted to start a school of her own , a school to " make colored girls plain and decent . " She began in a rented house with five girls . She got five dollars for singing at a festival and made the first payment on the site of her present Bethune-Cookman College , at that time a dump-pile . Her girls cleared away the rubbish to give the-workmen room . In 1905 the school was chartered . In 1914 Mrs. Bethune bought a farm to " teach the girls sense , " and to raise vegetables for the table . By 1918 people had given enough money to build an auditorium . Later Governor Catts of Florida and Vice President Coolidge spoke at the dedication . A knowledge of these things added interest , for the clubwomen , to the competent , slow speech of Mrs. Bethune . And she further interested them because , with her big comfortable body , big lips , slow voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negress which made such superlative nurses for the sons of neat white women- before these white women took up " social service .
