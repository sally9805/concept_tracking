Threat Executed <P> Almost a decade ago the Chicago Tribune , self-styled " World 's Greatest Newspaper , " ordered its correspondent in Moscow to present the following ultimatum to Soviet Foreign Minister Georg Tchitcherin : " You must abandon your censorship and guarantee freedom of expression , otherwise our correspondent will be withdrawn and so will the correspondents of other American newspapers , so that Russia will find herself without means of communication with the outer world . " The rage into which Comrade Tchitcherin flew when he read these words was towering , to say the least . " The newspaper speaks to me , " he stormed , " as if it were a government of equal power ! " His reply was to expel the Tribune 's correspondent , George Seldes , * thus preventing potent , four-fisted , he-publishers Robert Rutherford McCormick and Joseph Medill Patterson from executing their threat . In due time the " World 's Greatest Newspaper " calmed down and sent other representatives to Moscow who have submitted tamely to the Red censorship for several years . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again up . <P> " In order that our readers may have at least a measure of news from Russia accurately and impartially presented , " the Tribune editorialed , " we have abandoned our bureau in Soviet Russia . " Most of the news that American correspondents can obtain in Russia is contemptuously , and rightfully so , described as " handouts . " The Soviet news agency edits the news and fabricates information to conform with Communist policies . <P> " If an American correspondent expects any privileges from the government he must cable thousands of words of Soviet propaganda to his paper , and he must be cautious with the news he obtains from other sources . <P> " The correspondent is treated as a guest of the government and just so long as he acts as an agent for the Soviet Regime he is tolerated . When he presumes to act as an agent for the paper which employs him , maintains his office , pays his expenses and pays his cable charges , when he attempts to be faithful with his readers , he is persona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at official suggestion he is invited to leave the country . In the future all our reports from Russia will come from agents sent to the country on special assignments . " <P> Seasoned observers sympathized with the Tribune 's irate editor , but pointed out that Soviet Russia is too big to be bluffed , even by the " World 's Greatest Newspaper . " The only practicable means of getting out Soviet news is that employed by Walter Duranty of the New York Times . Day after day , with infinite patience and good humor , he files despatches which cost his paper a great deal , and only occasionally contain really big news . By carrying something every day and ingratiating himself after long years with the Soviet government , patient Walter Duranty is able to get past the censor all the news of Russia that really matters . <P> The situation is far worse in Italy . There all the correspondents bootlick Prime Minister Mussolini or are thrown out . In Spain the censorship of Dictator Primo de Rivera is theoretically absolute , but the indolent Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please .
