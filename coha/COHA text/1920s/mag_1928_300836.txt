Surrounding himself with newspapermen at his Wayside Inn in Sudbury , Mass. , Henry Ford talked publicly for an hour last week . He mentioned Prohibition , as follows : <P> " The worst thing that could happen to this country would be a step backward in our fight against liquor . . . . Such a change repeal of the 18th Amendment would be a calamity , but there 's no possibility of it . As for present enforcement conditions , we manage to get along well enough at Detroit , although we are next door to Canada . Personally I 'd turn out the army and navy to stop bootlegging . <P> " But if the law were changed , we 'd have to shut down our plants . Everything in the United States is keyed up to a new pace which started with Prohibition . The speed at which we run our motor cars , operate our intricate machinery , and generally live would be impossible with liquor . No , there is no chance even of modification . " <P> Citizens wondered what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ford 's reasoning processes and the processes of John Jacob Raskob , retired finance chairman of General Motors , the biggest Ford competitor . Long before his new political activities caused him to withdraw from General Motors , Mr. Raskob was , as everyone knows , active in the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment . <P> The " real father " of General Motors , President William Crapo Durant , of the Durant Motor Co. , made a gangplank speech about national affairs before sailing for Europe last week . About Prohibition , he said : <P> " For the widespread disobedience to the liquor law as embodied in the Constitution , the business leaders of the country are very largely responsible . Had our business leaders frowned upon instead of encouraging bootlegging , had they raised their voices in protest of public and private violations , had they used their money and their influence to obtain a fair trial for one of the best measures ever adopted by this or any other country-in other words , if they had supported the Constitution of the United States-our public officials ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our employes and the thinking public generally would without question have caught the spirit of law observance . . . . <P> " Business leaders , who have the largest stake in law observance , set the example of law defiance .
