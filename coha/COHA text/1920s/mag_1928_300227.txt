It was the open season for Governors in the South last week . Twenty of them gathered at New Orleans to confer . The most eminent Governor of all , New York 's Smith , was not far from New Orleans , golfing and fishing at Biloxi , Miss . But he did not " take in " the conference . Maryland 's Ritchie was over in Florida , but he , too , kept his vacation inviolate . Other notable absentees from the New Orleans meeting were Mississippi 's Bilbo , who telegraphed that he was too busy even to fly down from Jackson for a day ; and Massachusetts ' Fuller , who , in the course of winding up his administration , punctuated the week by saying : " The greatest danger that confronts us . . . is the result of avarice on the part of our ' best people ' . " <P> " Hoover Plan . " Happiest and most eager of the Governors was Maine 's Brewster . He carried and soon delivered an authorized message from the President-Elect himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help carry out the Hoover dream of " abolishing poverty . " It being impossible for the Governors ' conference to enforce resolutions or fix programs , the Hoover plan was received with applause only , not acted upon . <P> Speculation in securities and agricultural products was causing several Governors deep concern . Alabama 's Graves observed that speculative loans " right now " exceeded what had been loaned to planters to produce the next cotton crop . He viewed with alarm the Federal Reserve effort to discourage market gambling by jacking up interest Crates because the effect of this policy is to make borrowing injuriously expensive for " legitimate business . " " There is nothing wrong with America except the evils of mad gambling in stocks and cotton , " announced Governor Graves . Iowa 's Hamill and Nebraska 's McMullen ( chairman of the conference ) agreed . <P> Taxation . The Governors compared their states ' pocketbooks and methods of filling them . Louisiana 's Long instructed his guests as to the virtues and efficacy of the severance tax-a sort of subterranean tax imposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources ( oil , illuminating gas , etc. etc . ) . <P> Minnesota 's Christianson arose to complain about the U. S. Supreme Court 's ruling that national banks are federal agencies and therefore exempt from cer tain state taxes . His point was that na tional banks are operated for the benefit of stockholders and should therefore be taxed the same as state banks .
