txt The War Departm'ent recently requested the House Committee on Appropriations to vote $27,000 to make good the shortage of an embezzling army officer attached to an American Embassy , the officer having signed a Government check to pay his gambling losses , according to a statement made in the House today by Representative Madden Of Illinois , Chairman of the committee . The attachd , whose name was not disclosed , was afterward acquitted by a court-martial , said Mr. Madden . The committee did not comply with the War Department 's request to make up the shortage out of Government funds . It was during the debate on the Treasury supply bill when the matter came up . Representative Blanton of Texas renewed his attack on the Mitchell courtmartial verdict . Taking advantage of the rules that permit discussion of questions other than those presented in the measure . under debate , Mr Blanton declared that it , a.s high time that Congress abolished courts-martial in time of peace . He cited the alleged miscarriage of justice in the case of an army Major who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of a Captain who , according to Mr. Blanton , had embezzled Government funds , and who was let off with nominal punishment after he had made an offer to restore the money . " In this case the Court found that the accused had money . " Mr. Blanton told the House . Continuing , Representative Blanton said that the Court that tried the army embezzler was rebuked by the President and he had read from the Clerk 's desk the President 's comment on the case . Madden Reveals Embezzlement . At this point Representative Madden interrupted Mr. Blanton to make this statement : " I want to say to the gentleman that we had a case before our committee where the War Department asked us to recommend an appropriation of $27 , - 000 to make up a shortage of a military attachd where he signed a check of the Government on a bank to make his gambling losses good . We asked them if he was in jail , and they said no : they were trying to get the thing adjusted . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Distinguished Service Cross , " observed Mr. Blanton . " We said if he was not in jail we would not consider it . " resumed Mr. Madden . " If he was in jail we would . We found out afterward that he was acquitted by a court-martial . " " Why , of course , the officer was acquitted , " said Mr. Blanton. " and- that is why I have reached- the conclusion that there is no justice whatever in Peace-time court-martial trials , either in the army or the navy . They are comical farces , pure and simple . When the accused has not laughed at some other officer and there are enough bars or stripes or stars on his uniform to give him a standing , he is acquitted as a matter of course ; but if it is discovered that he happens to know a little more than the members of the General Staff or if he happens to be some poor devil with little prominence he is always convicted and given a terrible sentence . " Representative Begg of Ohio , Democrat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cruel than the treatment accorded the worst murderer . " Wainwright Defends the Verdict . Declaring that respect for superior authority is the keystone of discipline , Representative Wainwright of New York , Republican , former Assistant Secretary of War , said : " Maintenance of discipline , obedience of the articles of war by members of our military forces are just as essential in time of peace as in time of war . Unless maintained in time of peace there can be no discipline in time of war . Without discipline we can have no army either in peace or'war . " Lie who lends himself to the weakening of discipline contributes to destruction of the army . Surely such can not be the purpose of the - gentleman to whom I have referred . No patriot could wish for that result . " The use of such language constituted prejudice to good order and military discipline and should not go unrebuked unless all respect for high authority upon which the whole structure of ells ! cipline must rest is to be impaired and fall away . " In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of our power he may have rendered further service . But that has not justified him even in the interest of what he had appeared to have so much at heart to violate the law and customs and traditions of the ser , vice to which he has sworn .
