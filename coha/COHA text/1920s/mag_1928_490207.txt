ANYTHING that promotes amity between nations excites us , because that is what this planet really has to worry about . Mr. Hoover immediately aroused our interest by deciding to go on a good-will trip to South America . Yet when we learned that he was going to make his peace voyage in a battleship , we realized that he had no more imagination than we gave him credit for . How can anyone with a first-rate mind start out in a battleship to spread peace ? Another thing that discouraged us in the news of his venture was a very informative little paragraph in a press dispatch from Palo Alto . " President Coolidge and the State Department , " it said , " have cooperated by feeling out countries on the proposed route to be sure no ill-will will he encountered . " Our childish dreams are still of a hardier leader , who would set out in a Swampscott dory for the very places where the ill-will existed . ALTHOUGH we do n't know what Governor Smith 's first act would have been , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as starting for Valparaiso on a battleship . Nor can we picture him , defeated , retiring from public life . To us Governor Smith is still a very promising young man , with executive talents which are so well established and so much a part of him that he ca n't very well quit and be happy . We have our eye on him , and suspect that he is going to get ahead . One job which should he open for him is mayor of New York  --  and that , incidentally , is an idea we grew excited about years ago . One of the natural politico-social progressions , it seems to us , is from the governorship of New York to the mayorship of Gotham . Further , the city may some day secede from the Union , over some such matter as the Mabel Willebrandt issue . In that event , how better could it flourish than under the rule of Alfred E. Smith ? We see visions of a magnificent monarchy , rooted in wisdom , separated from jersey , led toward the light by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this proposal under advisement and let us know , at his convenience , what he thinks . TN their search for life 's rewards , 1 . some people arc never tiring . A man we know moved into a Fifth Avenue apartment because the bathtub commanded a view of Central Park and he could enjoy a vista of the bridle path while soaping himself . But he now complains bitterly to the building owner because he wants a side-street number , instead of a Fifth Avenue number . He has , in fact , written a letter to the owner and one to the Borough President , setting forth his woe . " I have a personal feeling , " he wrote , " that Fifth Avenue addresses are not dignified . " We will never know whether he dictated the letter from the dignity of his bathtub . OUR latest advice from the Western Union company is a polite note telling us that it is socially correct to send telegrams . Or , as the note delicately puts it , to send " the little yellow telegram . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow telegram can be put , the note says , is to invite guests to your parties . Well , if this practice ever becomes popular with hostesses , we can foresee a rather handsome revenue for the company , particularly from wedding invitations ; for , unless a hostess is a terrible piker , she will not only have to give the bride 's middle name , but will have to close her wire with the date of the party , in the usual manner : December the First , One Thousand Nine Hundred and Twenty-Eight . There 's ten words right there ! WHEN we arc not peering into excavations , we are usually looking in pet-shop windows . We looked in Holden 's Dog Store in Madison Avenue the other morning and found a great change come over the place . They used , if you remember , to sell dogs and books ? " both for the home . " Now they sell just pets . The books were gone . In this we saw a strange portent : the ultimate disappearance of hooks from the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourself with the thought that " May 1 assist you , madam ? " " N-no-1 'm just on my way to the religious books . " the home will always be safe as long as there are wire-haired puppies to keep it in a state of continual and ecstatic disorganization . Hard-Boiled WHENEVER Knute Rockne comes to town , as he did last weekend to direct his Notre Dame football team in its game with the Army , alumni hero give a dinner for him . Word goes out that no one is to wear evening dress . The sight of a gentleman in anything even as mildly effete as a smoking jacket is a signal for the squat , bald coach of the Fighting Irish to deliver what has become a familiar tirade of his on the decline of manhood . He likes men to be hard . Every so often he invents a new name for soft-handed males  --  the latest is " mezzanine-floor hurdlers . " Notre Dame is his ideal of an institution of higher education because it has no fraternities or co-eds , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been taking husky Notre Dame teams around the country , like barnstormers . No other team ranges as far and wide as his , and he has done more than any other man , perhaps , to cause the cry of overemphasis-on-football to be raised in the land . His men practice in summer and in winter . He himself makes an all-year-round profession of coaching , giving summer courses in that art at Northwestern University for which he uses as textbook a volume he wrote himself . This summer Rockne chartered the Carmania to take students and tourists ; ea the Olympic Games  --  the first time so large a vessel was ever taken over by an individual  --  but he did n't neglect his classes . The coaching courses were given on board . The story most frequently told about the Norwegian concerns a player who had cut practice to attend a tea . Rockne held him on the sidelines after that , saying he was " saving him . " During the final game of the season , the youth , still on the bench , asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prom , " said Rockne . He goes to great lengths to make little parables of the sort as a lesson to his men . Several years ago Carnegie Tech defeated Notre Dame in a game from which the coach was absent . He uttered no reproaches , but the following weekend , after the team had hoarded a train for the West Coast , each man found in his grip a newspaper opened to the account of the Carnegie disgrace . Rockne is usually given most of the credit for developing the forward pass ? now a major strategy of the game and a major box-office appeal . Last week some twenty thousand people could not get tickets for the ArmyNotre Dame game , but the first meeting of the two teams , m 1913 , was watched by a mere handful of spectators . In that game Rockne himself played at end fur Notre Dame and caught long , accurate forward passes from halfback Dorais , passes which baffled the Army and led to its defeat 35-13 . In the summer before that season , Rockne had got Dorais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a summer resort , where the two students worked during vacation . Even at that time , Rockne intended to become a coach and spent long hours working out plays . Many colleges have bid for his services , the most sensational offer having come from Columbia several years ago . It is said that Columbia offered him twenty-five thousand dollars , a part of the sum to come from a chemical firm here , for which the coach was to work in spare time ( in college he had excelled in the study of chemistry and , after graduation , taught it for a while ) . Since , at the time , Rockne had a contract with Notre Dame  --  and still has ? good until 1934 , the Columbia negotiations fell through , although a strange sort of contract , said to he contingent on Rocknc 's getting a release from Notre Dame , was signed . Notre Dame pays the coach ten thousand dollars a year and is not eager to release him . His teams have won a great majority of the games they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous Four Horsemen team of 1924 , have been rated the best in the country . Rockne now seems willing to remain at Notre Dame permanently . Two years ago he was confirmed in the Catholic faith and took his first communion with the entire football team . ? WE wo n't mention names , but when a certain famous actress opened as a star in a play on Broadway last week she received from her Sister , who is a famous motion-picture actress , a telegram which read : " Remember , dear , that whatever happens , mother and I still love you . " Radio Hour ONE strange election bet which 1.  --  ? we 've just heard about was made by a perfume manufacturer who had what seems , as we look back , to have been a rather touching faith in Smith 's chances . He bet a friend that Smith would get two hundred and ninety-two electoral votes . He named the states which would provide these votes , and agreed to pay a dollar for every vote under his estimate . He spent election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As each state was reported he wrote out a cheque and next day-turned over the whole pile to his friend . Oklahoma Ten and No Hundreths Dollars ; New Mexico Three and No Hundreths Dollars ; Texas minus Massachusetts Two and No Hundreths Dollars . And so on , far into the cheque hook . We also heard of a zealous partisan who succeeded in cutting down Hoover 's vote by fifteen . There was , prior to the last election , much pairing of votes -- a Smith man and a Hoover man agreeing that neither would cast his ballot . Thus both would be saved the bother of registering and going to the polls . Taking advantage of this practice , the knave we are told of paired with fifteen Hoover supporters . Backstage ON a night after a show has got under way , you feel a sense of coldness ' backstage . Things drop with is dismal hollow sound . The gay noise and excitement of the play 's first night have departed . No dressed-up people shoulder in and out of dressing-rooms , laughing and shouting , kicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt hats move around , pulling ropes , speaking in monotones , slowing things . The place has the look of a ship 's hold and the air of a hospital corridor . No matter where you stand , after the curtain descends you are in the way . Two rough fellows moving part of a drawing-room wall chivvy you about , and four men carrying- a heavy table push you against a wall . You get caught in a coil of ropes , and your hand comes away dusty from a fat piece of scenery with fountains painted on it . Wearing two Coats because he is chilly , and because no backstage person ever wears an overcoat , a morose fellow calls up into the murkiness of the roof , " Let down the lung line , Joe . " The mystery of backstage ropes is a profound thing . A weighty , gray man , with the eye of a night clerk , watches the stage door to obstruct the progress of anyone who wants to get in without good reason . The actors come off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from smoking jackets into morning suits for their next entrance . One of them pauses with his trousers off to smoke a cigarette . Another sits down and frowns over a bill . The director goes from room to room with suggestions about changing lines , for lines are still being changed after several weeks of playing . " Cut the curse and put hack the giggle , " he commands . When the show is over the actors dress- languidly for the street , heckled by a few beaming friends , for whom a dressing-room is a place of glamour . A salesman of face powder and grease paint comes in and is told to return Tuesday . A stage colleague out of work leans against a wall , thumbing over Variety . " Swell house tonight , " he says . " They were cold , though , " answers the actor , looking up from behind a dirty , brown-stained towel . Another player comes in half-dressed , and asks for the loan of a stamp , or two dollars . When the visitors leave the theatre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadminded THE funeral services for Arnold Rothstein , the murdered gambler , were held from a mortuary chapel , and it happened that another funeral was going on in the same establishment at the same fine . In the midst of things , 0 . ? . and I /712'e-. full confidence in the intelligence of the American people . " a man hurried in from the street He seemed nervous , and was both hatless and breathless . One of the undertakers stepped up softly and asked him which funeral he wanted to attend . " Either , " he said . Hopping Off T " airways life of this city is just beginning to burgeon . There is high hope for a daily passenger plane service to Chicago before the year is out , and several fourteen-passenger ships are being made ready to travel regularly between here and Boston . The newly opened line to Montreal is already being pretty well patronised . Even so , Albany is just now a busier airport than New York  --  the regular services to Chicago and Cleveland , for instance , start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishing transport tines . There was a route direct to Cleveland but it had to be abandoned because of the heavy pressure of air mail out of this city . Mail planes which carried people to Boston this summer no longer do because , on winter schedule , they depart and arrive in the night . If a single-motored mail plane  --  which , so far , is the only type used for carrying the malls in this district  --  had trouble over the metropolitan area , it would be difficult to effect a safe landing . Therefore , since great care is taken to prevent accidents that might make the public wary of airplane travel , no passengers are taken except in daylight . This is not true out west , where there is always a landing field in sight , an advantage that has given Chicago and other cities a big lead over New York in aerial transport . The Chicago to Cleveland route , for example , has become almost as well established as train or bus lines . They say that farther west  --  between San Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to book passage many days in advance . There is no particular rush for places on planes running from here . The most travelled routes are those to Washington , Albany , and Montreal , but , at that , usually not more than four people fly to the capital in a day . The NOVEMDER f 7 , 19 28 regular schedule calls for one four-passenger plane ; sometimes an extra one is put on , but not often . We watched a man buying a ticket to Washington the other day , at a counter fitted up with timetables , sightseeing folders and so on , in the office of Air Associates , at 535 Fifth Avenue . There are several other midtown air-ticket stations , and most hotels will arrange for accommodations . Although the trip to the capital takes only two hours , the passengers are not exactly whisked away . The airport for New York is the great metropolitan field outside of Newark , which must first be readied by tube or taxi or both . This takes time and is not fun . These incidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of the ticket , which is thirty dollars one way . It costs fifty dollars to go to Montreal and twenty-five to Albany . Rates are constantly being lowered . The aviation men say that the trip to Chicago will cost only one hundred dollars , which is considered cheap  --  it used to cost as much to go from here to Cleveland in the mail planes , which no longer take passengers . The transport people do nut set much store by the new Barren Island airport now being constructed on the south shore of Long Island because it is so far away from the heart of the city . Clarence Chamberlin , who was hired by the city to superintend the construction , found it so far that he used to fly to work in an amphibian rather than make the long journey across Brooklyn by subway or taxi . At His Desk INTERESTED in small facts about Presidents-Elect , we have learned that the top of Mr. Hoover 's desk is always neat as a pin , with papers in trim Files , pens laid parallel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sup- posed to pack a trunk  --  by just throwing things in . Our informant says nothing exemplifies the Hoover system better than the way in which he handles his cigars . He takes a new box of them , rips off the cover , pulls open a drawer , dumps the cigars into the drawer , nod tosses the box and cover onto the floor . When he offers a visitor a smoke he pulls open the THE NEW YORKER drawer , grabs a handful of cigars , and shoves them at him . More Clocks WHEN we were very young a V V man used to come to our father 's house every Monday morning to wind and set the clock in the hall . One morning he did n't come and the dock stopped ; our uncle set it going again , standing on a ladder , while the whole family helped him with advice and comment . Of all the clock-winders who used to go about the city only two , we had heard , were left  --  Julius De Jonge and Louis Froelich . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we found Mr. De Jong-e , an elderly man with a white heard , round-ended fingers , and a face like that of some Swedish novelist whose name we have forgotten . Yes , he still did some clock-winding , he told us  --  did it on Fridays and it took him all day . He went to six houses in town and one up the Hudson , in Nyack . There were still people who would pay a dollar a week to give their clocks the right care ; the rest of the time he did clock-repairing for his brother . Mr. Froelich of A. C. Benedict &; Co. , a jewelry store in the Bowery , we found to our disappointment is no longer a clack-winder . Clocks used to he different , he admitted to us with a certain regret , glancing round the little store where , behind five long show-cases , his jewellers and repairmen sat at work ; in the old days a clock-winder got fifty cents for each place he visited and each man had his own territory  --  there was the Murray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drive Winder . He pointed to a tall clock standing against one of the rear walls ; it had been go ing , he said , a hundred and eleven years . Mr. Froelich is a small fellow with gray hair and the sort of skin that is seen only in babies and in old men who have lived regular lives , and , like De Jonge , he has short blunt fingers . He explained that the electric clocks of the Western Union Telegraph Company had made cluck-winders unnecessary and that clocks are better now  --  even the big ones run with springs instead of the weights that used to get out of order so easily . Speaking of electric clocks , he told us that a firm in Massachusetts , capitalizing the fact that the big electric companies use a power-stroke of sixty to the minute  --  or the same as that of a dock keeping perfect time  --  manufactures a clock that runs without spring or weight  --  you just plug it into the wall . It costs twenty-five dollars and is supposed to run forever . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for generations another firm of Benedicts ( no connection with the Bowery store ) whose time , Benedict Time , used to be the standard for the whole city . This company also has no more nse for clock-winders , and Benedict 's Time , though still ac- curate , has become obsolete . As if to illustrate the changing of times and the time our informant showed us the store 's account-book for 1834 , with many charges for clock-oil to one Robert Bonner . Had we heard of the Bonner who owned trotting horses ? Had n't we heard of his trotters Maud S. , Dexter , and Sunol ? Well , Mr. Bonner used the clock-oil in his rigs . And in the old book was another entry : " Charged , to C. Vanderbilt , one imitation diamond pin , $1.25 . " The Ga Nomies ONE of the far-famed Broadway V producers , talking over a forthcoming musical comedy with Mr. Romberg , the composer , told the latter he wanted some music for the Ga Nomies ' dance . Mr. Romberg , whose mind works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were undoubtedly a foreign dance team , and he turned out a piece with a fine lilting swing , something for an athletic couple to step to . When this was played to the producer , for his approval , it seems that his expression grew curiouser and curiouser . Finally he expostulated . " You got it wrong , " he said . " What I meant was the little Ga Nomies  --  you know  --  the kind that come out of the bushes . "
