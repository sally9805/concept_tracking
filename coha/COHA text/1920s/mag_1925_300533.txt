In six special trains , which had paused on their dash southward only to take on ice , 1,000 delegates to the 14th annual convention of the Investment Bankers ' Association of America were met at Winter Park , 140 miles from St. Petersburg , by the St. Petersburg Chambermen of Commerce , with several squads of motorcycle policemen and 54 enormous motor busses , which shimmered in the station-yard like a caravan of painted elephants . Handshaking , backslapping , ensued . The bankers dispersed to divert themselves before settling down to the serious sessions of boosting , debate , criticism which would begin next day . <P> Store windows had big signs up : " Bankers , give Florida due credit . Check it up and pledge to indorse it without protest . . . . " A real estate spellbinder went about urging bankers " to give Florida help with bonds , stocks , debentures , and other collateral . " Almost none of the financiers thus exhorted were able to discover exactly what was meant . <P> Dry raiders confiscated 100 quarts of whisky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention . No warrants were issued . <P> Robert A. Gardner ( Mitchell , Hutchins &; Co. , Chicago ) and George V. Rotan ( Newhaus &; Co. , Houston ) , in an exhibition golf match against Walter Hagen and Gilbert Nichols ( trick-shot artist ) , beat them , 2 up . <P> Less proficient players indulged in a tournament of their own . On the desk of the Soreno Hotel the winners ' trophies stood on display-two cocktail shakers . <P> Having completed their preliminary investigation of Florida conditions , the delegates assembled for their first session . A letter from President Coolidge was read by Eugene E. Thompson ( Crane , Paris &; Co. , Washington ) . Many of the delegates thought that the President himself was reading to them , for Mr. Thompson strongly resembles Mr. Coolidge , except that he is not quite so angular . The President stated that he approved of the Association 's efforts to stop the sale of unsound securities . Then an epistle from Secretary Mellon was read . Mr. Mellon explained why it is to the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securities . <P> Thomas N. Dysart , President of the Association , scored the " blue-sky " laws , which attempt to save the ignorant stock buyer from the clutches of unscrupulous dealers .

Morgan &; Co. ) advised the public to divert the flow of the country 's exportable capital from foreign bonds to domestic investments that yield dividends . " Why , " he asked , " should the American investor hold the bag ? " <P> E. H. H. Simmons , President of the New York Stock Exchange , said : <P> " A good many of us do not appreciate what the Stock Exchange does for us . After all , what we do here is to sell securities and make an initial offering . We regulate the price in that initial offering , and then we pass them on to the Stock Exchange for a secondary market . All of us know that the secondary market is much more difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are good securities , and their secondary market on the Stock Exchange will be well taken care of .
