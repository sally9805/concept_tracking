When the Rev. Benjamin C. Dahnes of Mountain Home , Pa. , married divorced 5- &-10; Tycoon Sebastian Spering Kresge to Mrs. Clara K. Swaine last December , he violated no civil law . However , in the Methodist Episcopal Church is a law which says that no minister may marry a person who has been the " guilty party ' ' in a divorce suit . In his last divorce suit Mr. Kresge was judged a " guilty party " and did not contest the judgment . Therefore , the Rev. Benjamin Dahnes did violate a law of his Church . <P> <P> Consequently , charges were brought against him . Last week after a closed-door session , the Philadelphia Methodist Episcopal Conference exonerated him because he had " apologized ' ' and explained that he knew very little of the Kresge divorce story . <P> Last week in Manhattan , the Presbytery of New York appointed five " divorce counsellors. " * One of these must be consulted by all Presbyterian ministers before they may marry divorcees .
