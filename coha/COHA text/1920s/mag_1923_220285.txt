The Terrible and the Pathetic , Tragedies Old and New <P> There are two kinds of tragedy : terrible and tearful . When you saw John Barrymore carried up the front stoop of Elsinore and off into the West , you did n't feel like crying . A tragic climax such as that one gives a feeling of mystery and terror much more than of pity . When , on the other hand , you see Camille dying by inches in the postponed embrace of Armand Duval , you do want to weep . <P> There is no reason to despise the pathetic as opposed to the terrible- Some of the most poignant moments in all drama have been tearful . One such is the last scene of the Cherry Orchard , as presented by the Moscow Players . But there is a definite line separating the Shakespearean and Greek tragedies from the modern tragedy of defeat . <P> Within the last few weeks , there have been four new plays without a " happy ending . " There was , for example , A Square Peg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final curtain call , but that was not the trag-edy of the piece . The tragic climax came when he was denied the grateful haven of a jail sentence . It was not an inspiring catastrophe . One hardly felt toward Mr. Huckins as toward a Lucifer , shouting defiance from the overheated shade of the Inferno . <P> Then came The Laughing Lady , Ethel Barrymore 's comedy of epigrammatic manners . The impulse at the end of that entertaining series of pruderies was simply to call the author a liar and go home in disgust-or else not to believe that it was over at all . But even if you had thought that that was the end of all things for the heroine 's decorous amour , you would not have been thrilled at her renunciation . You could have cried about it . <P> The public reaction to Hail and Farewell is not hard to analyze . The public has been reacting to it identically-under the name of Ca- mille-for a good many years . And its mode of expression has been consistently lachrymal and always will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and persists in giving up her charming ghost at the critical moment . <P> The most recent of the tearful school is , of course , Humoresque . The last act is played in the midst of a murmur of wails and doleful little noises and choked sobs which bear eloquent witness to the emotional devastation enjoyed by the entire audience . <P> All these are instances of the tragedy of pity . There are very few modern plays wherein there is a sort of triumphant beauty even in defeat , as in the old schools of high tragedy .
