txt NEW JERSEY 'S LONE DEMOCRAT . To the Editor of The New York Times : Of course , there is an easy explanation of the absurd result In New Jersey , where one lone Democrat will sit in the Assembly next year , but few outside of the State know what it is . The election of but one Democrat out of the sixty Assemblymen illustrates the operation of the provision of the archaic Constitution whereby all the Assemblymen in each county are chosen on one ticket and not by districts . Any political swcep that affects all the counties results fn the winning party electing a disproportionate share of the Assembly and thus disfranchising in effect a large portion of the minority . Even in normal times , when the people at large have elected a Governor of one party , the other party has several times been able to elect a majority of the Assembly solely by their success in one or two of the larger counties , notably Essex . This provision as to the Assembly is more than matched by the apportionment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the population . Thus Essex and Hudson , each with more than 600,000 population , have no more voice in. legislation in the Senate than Cape May or Sussex with about 30,000 apiece . To all intents and purposes it is a " rotten borough " system akin to the original English model and it does not gain any partk1ular credit by . being fashioned after the United States Senate . These methods of electing legislators in New Jersey tend , as observers well know , to strengthen the position of machine politicians in that State . JERSEYMAN .
