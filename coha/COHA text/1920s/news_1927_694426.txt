txt Committee Is Seeking Method of Continuing Intellectual Contact After Graduation , . STUDY TO TAKE TWO YEARS Commencement as Marking Halt in Learning Is Decried  --  Carnegie Corporation Backs Project . Plans to extend the intellectual activities of college men and women beyond commencement and make them a permanent part of graduate life are being formulated by a committee which the Carnegie Corporation of New York is supporting to the extent of $10,000 a year , it has been learned . The aims and methods of the undertaking were explained in an interview with Daniel L Grant , director , at the Carnegie offices at 522 Fifth Avenue . " The emphasis in modern American college and university life has fallen just a little off key , " he said . " Today there are several distinct inteersts which hold the alumnus or alumni to the Alma Mater . We might classify them as social , athletic , financial . and , in some cases , political . Nowhere do we hear much of the intellectual interests forming any link after commencement . " Our object is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of present methods , where their exist , of maintaining the intellectual link between educational institutions and graduates ; and , in the second place , to foster such relationships throughout the country . Commencement an Anomaly . " At present , as regards most colleges and universities , the word commencement is an anomaly , so far as intellectual interests , which are the principal justification of courses in higher learning , are concerned . Commencement seems to be rather the end than the beginning of intellectual activity with the majority of Americans . " We want to do this work not because of any conception that intellectual activity is profitable in the material sense of the word , but because we honestly believe that intelligent men and women will find more pleasure in giving reign to interest in various branches of learning than , say , in week-end parties or cocktails . " The time is ripe now for such an undertaking , for never before have we had so much leisure in this country . Furthermore , while communities have concentrated on educating the poor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have neglected the already educated . This is not a paradoxical statement , for it is the already educated  --  that is , the man or woman who has attended college , then dropped intellectual contacts  --  that is best equipped and most ready to benefit by a renewal of those contacts . " In order to accomplish our aims we shall cooperate with the American Association for Adult Education . supported by Carnegie funds , and with the American Alumni Council . comprising college and university alumni secretaries , alumni magazine editors , and those in charge of alumni funds . Wilt Try to Renew Contacts . " Few colleges have done much along the lines we contemplate , but there are some  --  Amherst , Smith , Vassar , for instance . Extension courses will fall within our scope . We shall also seek to have returning alumni renew their intellectual contacts as well as the social , meeting again their professors . Reading courses can be prescribed . " As an example , a gradaute of an engineering college who had become wrapped up in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who advised him while in college . The latter , whose work is to keep informed on all branches of the engineering field , would advise his former student of the general trend of engineering development , and would indicate sources to which he could revert to keep him broadly in touch with the entire field . " One of the tenets upon which such a program would be founded is that a man 's capacity to learn Increases rather than decreases after he has attained maturity . Such a program will endeavor to keep educational institutions continually active throughout the lives of its graduates as a steady intellectual stimulus . " The idea was originated at the University of North Carolina , where Mr. Grant was Executive Secretary of the General Alumni Association until he came here to take up his duties about a inonth ago . The other members of the committee are H. W. Chase , President of the university ; L. R. Wilson , Librarian ; H. W. Odum , Director of the School of Public Welfare and editor of Social Forces , and R. B. House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
