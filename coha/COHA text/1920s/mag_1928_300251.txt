A hundred years ago there was a Presbyterian clergyman in Scotland who could make lectures on mathematics so stirring that the authorities at St. Andrews , fearful of the excitement thus roused in the students , discontinued them . He was Dr. Thomas Chalmers , kindling and original personality , whose principal claim to fame is that he led a secession which split the established Church of Scotland , and presided over the founding of what is now known as the United Free Church of Scotland . <P> For nearly a century the two great divisions of the Scotch Presbyterian Church have struggled side by side . Last week the assembly of each voted , independently , approval of a plan for reunion which , it was hoped , would be consummated next year . <P> The Ten Years ' Conflict . Not on strictly doctrinal or theological differences did the disruption of 1843 under the leadership of Dr. Chalmers depend . In this regard the divided Presbyterian Church of Scotland presents a curious contrast to the Church of England , which is not divided physically , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high " church or " catholic , " and " low " church or " broad " ) on points of liturgy and doctrine . <P> The Scotch Presbyterians broke on the question of how far to tolerate interference in pastoral matters , and patronage , by the secular authority . <P> Beginning in 1833 intrusions by the secular authority caused bitterness . In accordance with the original constitutions of the church , the General Assembly in 1834 passed the famed Veto Act , providing that no pastor need be accepted by a congregation contrary to the wishes of a majority of its members . <P> But the right of the presbytery so to reject a pastor was denied by decisions in the courts . The matter was taken to the House of Lords , the Queen , the House of Commons . All sustained the court decisions . <P> At the General Assembly in 1843 , therefore , the non-intrusion party presented its protest and withdrew , to organize as the Free Church of Scotland . Dr. Chalmers was chosen first moderator of the new Assembly , protestant within protestantism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Separation , 474 clergymen and professors surrendered the benefices they held under the Establishment . To provide for them and to build churches was the enormous task Dr. Chalmers and his colleagues undertook . At the end of four years more than 700 churches had been provided . The Free Church , vigorous , evangelical , prospered . In 1900 it combined with the United Presbyterian Church . <P> From time to time tentative attempts toward reconciliation with the Establishment were made . Abuses by the secular authority having virtually ceased , and the leaders of the United Free Church having grown somewhat less stiff and proud , negotiations were resumed in earnest in 1909 . <P> Significance . Reunion of the two organizations , which it is hoped will be effected next year , would unite practically the entire Presbyterian body in Scotland , comprising roughly two-thirds of the Christian membership of the country . The Church of Scotland had an enrollment of 761,946 at the beginning of 1927 ; the United Free Church , 536,409.               @ @ @ @ @ @
