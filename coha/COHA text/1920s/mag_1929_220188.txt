Sixty-nine of the 275 Stock Exchange seats recently authorized had last week been sold . Recent sales have not been accompanied by any price announcements . Inasmuch as early sales in which the prices were announced showed that the new rights were selling at considerably under their theoretical $125,000 value , present silence on prices would indicate that the seats are still going at under par .
