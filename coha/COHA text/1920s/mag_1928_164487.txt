Spaniards of chivalrous and patriotic bent fetched dejected sighs , last week , at an authoritative report that the jaunty King Alfonso XIII has been constrained to consult the Vatican with a view to obtaining annulment of his union with Queen Victoria Eugnie , a tall and regal granddaughter of the late , dumpy British Queen-Empress Victoria . <P> His Most Catholic Majesty is thought to agree with Dictator Primo de Rivera that none of the four Spanish Infantes ( sons of the King ) are physically fit to inherit the Throne . For their weaknesses and infirmities His Majesty is understood to blame not his own ardent self , but Her Majesty . He is said to have tested this theory by begetting , under the rose , certain quite robust offspring . <P> Meanwhile , unfortunate Queen Victoria Eugnie is not likely to forget that she is descended ( through her father ) from the Teuton family of Hesse-Darmstadt . In the strain of that House abides the dread and mysterious disease , haemophilia . <P> The blood of a haemophile does not congeal normally upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to profuse bleeding , due to the extreme retardation of the process vulgarly called " healing . " Now it happens that from the haemophilic House of Hesse-Darmstadt have sprung the last of the Russian Tsarinas , Alexandra , and the present Queen Victoria Eugnie of Spain . To each of these exalted mothers came the bitter pang of recognizing in her first born son a haemophile . <P> As everyone knows Tsarina Alexandra &; Tsar Nicholas the Last came under the influence of the notorious " Black Monk " Rasputin because he could control-it is said by hypnotism-the haemophilia of the Tsarevitch Alexis . Not until the assassination of Rasputin and the execution of the Romanovs did History have done with that dark incident . Today Queen Victoria Eugnie of Spain is said to repose a strong intuitive faith in a certain obscure Catalonian doctor whom she hopes may be able to cure the haemophilia of her first born , Don Alfonso , 21 , Prince of the Asturias , and heir to Alfonso XIII 's throne . <P> Last week this slender , pale and weak young prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an operation upon his mouth which would have been negligible in a person of normal health . A pretense is kept up that the Prince of the Asturias is a " gentleman farmer " much interested in raising crops and breeding hogs ; but most of his prolonged sojourns upon his estates are passed in pallid relaxation . Moreover , an inflammation of His Royal Highness ' joints has set in of late . <P> Second in line for the Spanish Throne is Don Jaime , 19 , a thickset , powerfully athletic youth , but congenitally deaf and mute . He now " hears " by " lip reading , " ' and has been taught to make intelligible sounds ; but Spaniards scarcely deem him fit to be their King .
