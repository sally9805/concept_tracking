THE SUN ALSO RISES-Ernest Hemingway-Scribner ( $2 ) . A lot of people expected a big novel from burly young Author Hemingway . His short work ( In Ou Time , 1925 ) bit deeply into life . He said things naturally , calmly tersely , accurately . He wrote only ; about things he had experienced mostly outdoors , as a doctor 's son in northern Michigan and as a self-possessed young tramp in Europe . Philosophically his implication was : " Life 's great . Do n't let it rattle you . "
