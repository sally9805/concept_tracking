txt The Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Co. reports trade quiet , with orders holding close to an even keel , while mantrfacturirg activity continues on at full pace , fully equal to anything reported in the past year or more . The unfilled orders as of May 1 showed a small gain over the previous month , with $10,190,000 , against $10 , - 140,000 on April 1 . Unfilled orders have now hovered around the $10,000,000 mark ever since January 1 , 1925 . In fact , it is necessary to go back to September 1 to find unfilled orders us large as $11,000,000 , so that the present total is showing great stability . Officials of the company expect a slight loss in new business as of June 1 , as there has been a noticeable lack of large sales of machinery for the last 30 days . None of the orders have run as large as $200,000 each . There are several big contracts under negotiation , but there seems to be some reluctance in closing these . It i believer that the many small orders provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account largely for the steady condition of order books month after month . Allis-Chalmers officials can see nothing . but quiet business in sight for the company over the next few months , in line with restricted trade in most business lines . No striking advance in business is in sight except for the occasional possible closing of some large order . Manufacturing of the company is still going on at a lively pace , with 6,066 employed as of May 1 , the largest number for more than a year . For several months the company has gradually been building up forces with the expectation that new orders would warrant such a policy . The stable condition of unfilled orders has justified the plan . This policy means that profits for the second quarter should be fully up to the total of the last two previous quarters . Electrical business of the company is well maintained , but there are no pronounced developments in this quarter . Expansion plans talked of some months ago have not materialized.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
