THE WIND AND THE RAIN-Thomas Burke-Doran ( $2.00 ) . <P> Tho men once sat in the Ivy Restaurant in London . One was a young composer who , after a long , long pull , was on the topside of his hour ; the other was Thomas Burke , onetime Hardcress Kid , now famed author of Limehouse Nights . While they ate , they telegraphed to each other in a code made up of the names of street corners , taverns , dives , the memories of tattered times . In this book , Mr. Burke writes , for those whom good luck has left happily unfamiliar with that code , the record of his life from the day when he , a waif as woebegone as Poor Tom on Lear 's heath , was befriended by Quong Lee , Chinese storekeeper , to the day when his first short story was published . Calm faces of Canton and Malaya move through mist down a narrow London street ; in bad doorways , sailors ' knives flash ; the rain beats a tattoo of talons on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind sniffs under the door . Tom , the Hardcress Kid , is safe now , warm , dry , nor does he try to cast over the shiverings of his penury any glamour other than that which properly belongs to peril overpast . His book will interest some because it is a fine piece of prose , some because it is the story of a man who knew too well that dingy code of the Ivy Restaurant , some because it is the life of Thomas Burke .
