Proud scores , proud hundreds of Bremen burghers trotted down with all their kinfolk to the mammoth docks at Bremerhaven last week to cheer themselves purple in the face . " Hoch der Bremen ! " roared stout sires . Dimpling Frauleins echoed , " Hoch der Bremen ! " Radio carried the massed cheering to remotest German hamlets . From stern Prussia to mellow Saxony the whole Fatherland throbbed and thrilled as croaking loud speakers announced that any moment now there would sail from Bremerhaven on her maiden voyage the giant S. S. Bremen-a supership built to wrest from Britain the trans-Atlantic speed record held for the past 22 years by Cunard 's famed Mauretania . <P> Time was when Germans dreamed of equaling Britain in sea power , but they learned to be less presumptuous at Versailles . Not long ago His Britannic Majesty 's government made known that the U. S. is to-day the only nation which they will abide on a parity of naval strength ( TIME , July 4 , 1927 , et seq . ) . Last week the North German Lloyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record , yet even that was bold , and of all who went to watch the Bremen steam away none knew this better than STIMMING . <P> The General Director of the North German Lloyd is a very tiny Prussian ( he stands scarce four feet ten ) yet full proportioned , hard , compact . A dynamo of vital energy , he has built up for the North German Lloyd a whole new post-Versailles fleet of 700,000 tons . A stickler for short cuts , he insists on being called only " STIMMING . " Even the German Who 's Who does not seem to know that the great little Prussian 's parents used to refer to him as " Karl . " Last week as he stood in the enormous shadow of the Bremen , the General Director must have felt as proud as a flea that had whelped a whale . Too modest and certainly too wise to boast , STIMMING compressed his exultation into three sentences that spoke volumes , " Mein herren " he said in his always calm low voice to correspondents . " Gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - of ten years . It is always a case of how things were ten years ago . But I should like to remind you that only eight years ago , thanks to the terms imposed upon Germany at Versailles , the total shipping carrying the flag of the North German Lloyd was exactly one tender , a tender scarcely big enough to convey the baggage now aboard our new Bremen . " <P> " Deutschland , Deutschland uber alles ! " sang the Bremerhaven throngs as the Bremen steamed away , and many a patriot recalled the grave yet stirring words of President Paul von Hindenburg when he launched the great ship last year . " It is our wish to give this newest and largest vessel of Germany 's revived fleet to its elements . I hail the Bremen ... as a manifestation of the indestructible German capacity for work ! " <P> STIMMING did not sail on the Bremen . He put President Philip Heineken of the North German Lloyd aboard and saw that the old gentleman was comfortable . Reporters were told that " pressing business detained " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that he never crosses the Atlantic on his own ships , always on those of competing lines , studying them , working hard , thinking harder . <P>
