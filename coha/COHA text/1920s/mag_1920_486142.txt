He was the first to demonstrate the existence of living glaciers in the Sierra Nevada , his conclusions , when he first stated them , being laughed to scorn by the scientists . Apart from his scientific work , Mr. Muir 's pregnainent service to his country was in the long fight , finally crowned with success , which he made to preserve the national parks and the forest reserves . 13e remained faithful to the end to his beloved Sierras. but he left them at times for ex  --  tensive travels , and his absorption in the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand , India , and South Africa Mr. Muir , besides innumerable ar boles in magazines and newspapers , pul lashed : " The Mountains of California , " 1894 " Our National Parks , " 1901 ; " Stickeen , the Story of a Dog , " 1909 ; " My First Summer in the Sierra , " 1911 ; " The Yosemite , " 1912 ; " Story of My Boyhood and Youth , " 1913 .

The English university drama of the six  --  teenth century has been slow in reaching modern scholars . Only very recently have the issues of the Malone Society and of Pro  --  fessor Bang 's " Materialien " ( suspended only temporarily , we may hope , by the dis  --  persion of the University of Louvain. ) begun to make accessible material for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keller and of Louise B. Morgan in the " Shakespeare Jahrbuch . " And until Pro  --  fessor Boas contributed a chapter to the " Cambridge History of English Literature " nothing like a comprehensive survey of the subject had been attempted . In the volume before us the latter end of the story is omitted ; we hear nothing of King James 's delight in " Ignoramus , " of the rise of pastoral and the spread of allegory on the university boards ; for these things and for a bibliography of the subject the reader is referred to the sixth volume of the " Cambridge History . " The present account ends with the death of Elizabeth ; almost , it might be said , it begins with the time of her birth ( 1533 ) , so late did humanism ma  --  ture in England ; and her visits to Cam  --  bridge in 1564 , to Oxford in 1566 and 1592 , were events of capital importance in the his  --  tory of academic drama . By limiting the scope of the book , more space could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely mentioned in the earlier article , such as the questionable identification of the ex  --  tant " Absalon " with Watson 's play of that name so highly praised by Ascham ; John Bridge 's claim to the authorship of " Gam  --  mer Gurtons Nedle , " and the controversy between the Puritan Rain olds and Gager , the Christ Church dramatist , over the propriety of college plays . But , indeed , at every point the subject gains by the detailed treatment it receives . The description " academic " is enough to relegate any play to oblivion ; the fact that it is written in Latin is sufficient to insure its permanent residence there . But under the spell of Professor Boas 's enthusiasm , and in the presence of his skilfully sustained analyses of the plays themselves , even the Prejudiced reader might be expected to kindle . For , in truth , the academic drama of the sixteenth century touched life and letters at many points . It was closely con  --  nected with the court . Performances were " ordered " by intending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of the Polish prince , Albertus Alasco , whom Lei  --  cester brought to Oxford in 1583 . Nobles like Lord Buckhurst , the Revels Office , too , helped to equip these academic plays ; on the occasion of Elizabeth 's first visit to Ox  --  ford Richard Edwardes , Master of the Chil  --  dren of the Chapel Royal , not only wrotehis famous and unhappily lost , " Palaraon and Arcyte , " but likewise had general super  --  intendence over the whole dramatic pro  --  gramme . There were close relations , too , between the academic drama and the popular stage . Lyly , Peele , Lodge , Nash , Greene , and Mar  --  lowe were all university trained men ; Peele superintended the performances at Christ Church in 1583 . Some news of all this dramatic activity reached Shakespeare : of Legge 's triple Senecan tragedy , " Richardus Tertius , " and , possibly , in " Twelfth Night , " ce the attractive Cambridge comedy , " Laelia . " Conversely , the academic drama  --  tist , though his models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Aristophanic sometimes , did not always write without knowledge of the popular stage . The anonymous author of " Caesar and Pompey , " an Oxford play of about 1594 , makes heavy draughts upon it , and the au  --  thors of the " Parnassus " trilogy , who de  --  spised the professional player with the per  --  fect contempt of the gownsman , made sa  --  tiric and critical fun of Shakespeare at every point . The play last named serves as a remin  --  der that not all the successes of the aca  --  demic drama were in Latin . At about the time of Shakespeare 's birth stands " Gam  --  mer Gurtons Nedle , " a Cambridge play , hap  --  pily uniting classical and native tradi  --  tionS . Among the early plays , one of the best , Christopherson 's 4106de , with its rem  --  iniscences of Euripides 's " Iphigenia in Aulis , " is in Greek . But Latin is the natural medium , and it is only because their achieve  --  ments are in this tongue , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grimald and William Gager do not hold an important place in the story of Tudor drama . To match the work of these Oxford tragedians , Cam  --  bridge can show comedies no less brilliant . And this in spite of the fact that the aca  --  demic drama seldom forgot its practical functions , of providing instruction , in its earlier stages of a moral , in its later of a rhetorical character . Only occasionally do we come upon Aristophanic fun adapted to local conditions , such as the satiric portrait of Gabriel Harvey in " Pedantius , " or the attack on the " town " in " Club Law . " Professor Boas 's volume , for its combina  --  tion of full detail and stimulating presenta  --  tion , will at once take its place among the classics of modern scholarship . At the Gaiety , Manchester , Miss Horniman intends , early in the New Year , to produce two plays of considerable interest . The first is " The One Thing Needful , " written by Miss Estelle Burney and Mr. Herbert Swea Originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the piece attract  --  ed more than ordinary attention It has since been largely revised and certain ob  --  vious defects have been removed . In its al  --  tered shape it will probably be seen later in London during Miss Horniman 's spring sea  --  son . From Mr. Frank Stayton Miss Horni  --  man has also acquired a play entitled " The Joan Danvers , " which is to see the light in due course . " THE LIE . " Except to say that Henry Arthur Jones 's new four-act drama , " The Lie , " can not under any circumstances be called a great play , one may well reserve downright judgment until it is produced in conditions more favor  --  able than those attending the representation at the Harris Theatre . For one thing , the play gets a poor start in the present produc  --  tion . The first act is one of those leisurely sketches of English characteristics , dear to both Jones and Pinero , and somewhat resembling the spacious scenes of eighteenth-century comedy , in which much is left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word , com  --  edy of manners . It sets forth simply and accurately the life of an aristocratic derelict , an old gentleman living on in the run-down abbey which for six hundred years has been occupied by his ancestors He is of the amusing type to whom all modern tendencies are villanous and all reformers and new as  --  pirants to fame and fortune are scoundrels Here Sir Robert lives with his granddaughter , Elinore ( Margaret Bling-ton ) , attended by two servants who can be retained only because they can not be paid off . Yet Sir Robert at  --  tains a modicum of comfort by recourse to wine and hunting , and though pretending to absolute independence , can see no reason why the rascals who have recently achieved prom  --  inence should not subsidize him as an ad  --  mirable example of the older order . The sketch , though done in simple colors , is quite convincing , and was fairly played by Mr. Alfred Bishop . But Miss Illington fitted poorly into the setting ; at least one of the servants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serrano , in the important part of Gerald ' Forster , a rich young engineer , in love with Ehnore , was entirely out of - his ele  --  ment. - - If this initial scene were better managed , it is quite possible that the succeeding tragedy would be more gripping than it is . For the tragedy has supreme elements . It relates a story of self-effacement on. , the part of Elmore , who , to shield her sister from the consequences of an irregular union , gives up for the time a chance to make a handsome marriage with Gerald . We need not explain the circumstances through which the sister Lucy ( well played by Miss Violet Herring ) contrives to convince Gerald , who has got wind of some irregularity , that Elmore and not she is guilty of the illegitimate child , and through which she marries Gerald herself . In the end , of course , Elinore hears of the lie and turns on Lucy ferociously , in a scene hav  --  ing- certain similarity to one in " The Lily , " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which shines through both Miss Illntgton 's limited abilities and Mr Jones 's inadequate treatment . For it is in  --  adequate . In the first place , he resorts to stage tricks , such as entrances in the nick of time to prevent important disclosures . Nor is he at pains to give a rounded human pic  --  ture of the younger sister , who in her un  --  relieved selfishness takes on much the pro  --  portions of an Elizabethan villain Altogether this play gives the impression of a work hastily put together ; which is per  --  haps the most severe charge that could be brought against it . For if such aspects of sex as that here presented must continue to occupy the stage , they should be treated in such a way as to free them entirely from the suspicion of commercialism . F. " POOR LITTLE THING . " An interesting experiment was initiated last week in the opening of the Bandbox Theatre , another of the " little theatres , " but this time dedicated to the special purpose of housing a repertory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the idea of such an enterprise no praise is needed ; the de  --  sirability , indeed the urgent necessity , for the best interests of drama of a revival of the repertory company is a matter on which virtually all who take an intelligent interest in the theatre are agreed It only remains to be said that the stock company of the Bandbox seems to have been well selected , and that the principle on which the plays are to be cast is obviously sensible , but unfor  --  tunately rare : there are to be neither lead  --  ing men nor leading women , but players are to he fitted to roles , not roles to players . The opening of this little theatre on East 57th Street , which has been renovated at  --  tractively , but not extravagantly , may be said to have been auspicious . The piece selected was " Poor Little Thing , " a new play in four acts by Jerome K Jerome , adapted from the French of Jules Lemaitre . In the adaptation it must be admitted that some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was inevitable , if we accept , as Mr. Jerome does , the necessity of toning down for Anglo-Saxon audiences the essential motive of the piece , which is the rivalry of father and son for the affections of the same girl . Mr. Jerome , therefore , reconciles the play with the ac  --  cepted canons of good taste by diluting the father 's passion for the girl into a mixture of platonic and paternal affection , thereby eliminating some of the clash of will which makes for dramatic intensity in the origin-al and weakening the character of the father . Mareze , a distinguished artist , is the adored " master " of a class of gushing girls . Their adoration and his pleased acceptance of it are equally innocent , and cause no pang to his honest and somewhat stupid peasant wife , who has not been able to rise with the grow  --  ing fame of her husband . But there is a gifted and favorite pupil , Juliette Dupuy , in whom Mareze takes an especial interest , which he describes to himself , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purity of Ins affection , however , he protesteth , though quite sincerely , overmuch , and arouses the jealousy of his wife . The climax comes when , on meeting the girl by chance in Mareze 's studio , in his own home , the wife in ungov  --  ernable passion forbids her to come there again . As the scene is in progress , the Ma  --  rezes ' son , Jacques , enters , and his sympathy with the girl is aroused , a sympathy - which is subsequently turned to love by a series of meetings for the discussion of high art . Ma  --  reze , deprived of the society of his favorite pupil , is conscious of a void , and only realizes the significance of his feeling when his own son announces his love for Juliette , and asks the parental consent to the marriage It is here that Mr. Jerome 's version of the play is weak and indefinite . The strongest emo  --  tion that he can allow to Mareze is a pro  --  nounced disinclination to seeing Juliette the wife of anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the wife becomes convinced of the perfect innocence of Juliette , and realizes that the solution of the problem is to be found in her marriage with Jacques , is dramatic , well written , and well played , but the method by which the consent of Mareze is finally obtained , through an announcement that he has been elected to the Academy , is decidedly inconclusive There are weak points in the play , and the tempo of the production throughout needs quickening , but it is an interesting and amus  --  ing little piece , well written , on the whole , and well acted by the Bandbox players . Eric Blind , in the principal role , a difficult and onerous one , gives an exceedingly clever per  --  formance , playing the temperamental artist with a nice understanding of character , and surmounting the difficulties propounded by the adapter in the emotional scenes at the end in a manner that is highly creditable . Miss Beverley Sitgreaves , as Mme Mareze , has an unsympathetic part , and is unsympathetic in it . William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of a boy , fresh and enthusiastic . The performance of Juli  --  ette by Miss Janet Dunbar stands out as an excellent piece of acting . She portrays ad  --  mirably , and without the least strain or over  --  emphasis , the innocent young girl forced by circumstances into a compromising position . Minor parts are capably played , and the stage settings are good . Altogether the opening production of the Bandbox encourages hope for its future success and usefulness . S. W. " TO-NIGHT 'S THE NIGHT " AND " LADY LUXURY . " The production last week by the same management on successive nights of two mu  --  sical comedies gives opportunity of compar  --  ing English and American methods in this field - of light amusement The comparison in one way is scarcely fair , since the Eng  --  lish offering at the Shubert Theatre by the company of the Gaiety Theatre , London , starts with the advantage of a plot borrowed direct  --  ly ( not for the first time ) from the old farce , " Pink Dominoes , " which lends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  sical comedy . In its present incarnation it is entitled " To-night 's the Night " ; the book is written by Fred Thompson , and the music , which is tuneful and catchy , if of no particu  --  lar originality , is by Paul A. Rubens The American piece is Rida Johnson Young 's " Lady Luxury , " with pleasing music by Wil  --  liam Schroeder , and a somewhat hackneyed and inflexible plot The comparison , however , is not as to which is intrinsically the better piece , for in musi  --  cal comedy ( as opposed to comic opera of the legitimate kind , an example of which New York has been fortunate enough to see this season in " The Lilac Domino " ) , that is really a minor consideration . The ensemble merit of these productions is to be judged by no criteria of dramatic or even of musical con  --  struction . All that is demanded is a thread of plot sufficient to give excuse for the vari  --  ous episodes which go to the making of the whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need by no means be strikingly original . Apart , then , from the individual performances of the players , the all-important matter is the method of production . Other things being equal , the success or failure of a show of this description depends upon those who are responsible for its dressing , its light  --  ing , its scenery , above all , the selection and rehearsing of its chorus . When we attend a musical comedy , we go , not craving intel  --  lectual stimulation , but only an agreeable satisfaction of the senses of sight and hear  --  ing , and some titillation , not too subtle , of the sense of humor . Musical comedy , in fact , is not legitimate drama or legitimate opera , but it is perfectly legitimate entertainment . It is in observing a high standard of pro  --  duction that the English method in musical comedy seems to excel the American . Opin  --  ions may differ concerning the quality of the humor provided by the English comedians in " To-night 's the Night " For our own part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hon. Dudley Mitten , and prefer the humOr which is derived from character , as this is , to that which is dependent upon situation , as is the case in " Lady Luxury " But were the humor of the two pieces trans  --  posed , the English production would still he the better on account of the tempo at which it is played , and the precision and unison of the ensemble movements The Gaiety chorus is not only exceedingly good to look upon ( a quality for which Gaiety pieces are renowned ) , but it knows its business thoroughly , and is trained to move with not less precision , though with infinitely more grace , than a Prussian regiment doing the goose step Added to this is the fact that the dressing and light  --  ing are well studied and in admirable taste and the result is a production the success of which is achieved mainly by an infinite capacity for taking pains It is precisely in this last quality that nine out of ten musical comedies produced on this side of the water are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powers of our producers " Lady Luxury , " for instance , though not a distinguished , is by no means a bad , example of the native musical comedy , and may be taken as fairly representative Some of the musical num  --  bers are extremely pretty , and the comedy of Edward Van Cuyler is sufficiently amusing , but the piece places its reliance almost en  --  tirely on the attractive personality of the star , Miss Ina Claire , and that is not enough to save it from intervals of dulness or to obscure the lack of adequate care bestowed on the rehearsing of the chorus . We have emphasized the part played by the chorus in the Gaiety production rather at the expense of the principals , but favorable mention should be made both of the talents and of the natural charm of Miss Emmy Whelen , Miss Iris Hoey , and Miss Fay Comp  --  ton Maurice Farkoa , James Blakeley , and Lauri de Frece , among the principals , also contribute not a little to the success of the piece . S W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ethel Watts Mumford , chose a fitting title for the three-act comedy at The Playhouse , which was man  --  ifestly written arqund the personality of Lydia Lopokova . This accomplished dancer is the life of the performance , not only because of the few steps which are permitted her , but equally because of her youthful charm and her ability to act . The part which she has to fill is exacting only in the sense that it requires her to be her simple self , but even this would make too great a demand upon many an actress Mlle. Lopokova contrives to forget the footlights and to be natural , and on the strength of her representation we venture to believe that she might safely be entrusted with other roles . She would he notable , for instance , in " Peter Pan . " In " Just Herself , " she takes the part of a girl of seventeen who has lived for twelve years at a dancing school in Germany .

The situation affords a chance for comedy of a rather obvious though amusing type , espe  --  cially where the former cook , a woman who will tolerate no nonsense , quietly upsets some of her daughter 's pretensions In the end it is owing , of course , to Euphemia 's charm that her people become intimately Joined to the most fashionable of their neighbors , for there is , naturally , a " heart interest . " Perhaps the prettiest portion of this slen  --  der play is that at Euphemia 's coming-out Party , where she shows the artistic posSi  --  bilities of the " fox trot " by putting into it the expression of her whole body . The death of Baroness Suttner has called attention to the fact that one of the last pages written by the inveterate champion of peace was an enthusiastic appreciation of Carl Hauptmann 's latest play , " Krieg , " with the grimly ironical sub-title " Tedeum " ( Leipzig : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet 's and her own conception of war , she saw the powerful possibilities of the play as a medium of the message of peace , admitted being profoundly stirred and enriched by it , and said that she could not let the opportunity pass without publicly thanking the poet for this work Noble and significant as is this endorse  --  ment , the play is of a quality bound to make a deep and lasting impression under any cir  --  cumstances The suggestion of palpitating life and movement in the action , the origi  --  nality of its haunting symbolism , are of a rare dramatic power . There is an element of the panoramic in the scenes themselves which seems to call for the genius of a Reinhardt or Belasco . In the first act there is a midnight congress of the world 's Powers , ermine-covered bears , roosters , eagles , and other significant figures ar  --  riving in great state to convene under the presidency of " the great European mathe  --  matician , " while in another part of the pal  --  ace of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic conflict between father and son .

The third act is one great orgy of bloodshed and bestiality , of life and death in savage combat , with the grewsome spectres of pestilence stalk  --  ing about between the healthy and the ail  --  ing and reaping a loathsome harvest  --  until the figure of the great lord of war , with the traits of the Corsican , disappears in a golden chariot drawn by an enthusiastic mob , but followed by an army of skeletons in ragged uniforms that march across the stage to the tune of a dirge The fourth act is the epilogue. palace and village are in ruins , cripples creep out from moundlike hovels that dot the once-thriving country .

" Art ARCHITECTURE IN THE AUGUSTAN AGE The name of Vitruvius is familiar to all students of architecture , and to many who have but a superficial knowledge of this sub  --  ject , but his writings are known to few ; and this new translation of his ten books on Architecture , in attractive form , will be wel  --  comed by many within and without the pro  --  fession . Although some doubts have been cast upon its authorship and the-date of its pro  --  duction , the book is now generally conceded to have been written by Marcus Vitruvius Pollio during the reign of Augustus Caesar , to whom it is dedicated . That the text has been preserved to us is without doubt due to the fact that it contains in the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules for the proportioning of the plans , and de- , tails of design and construction of temples , and other columnar structures , which rules its author professes to have gained bystudy of the practice of the Greek architects and their Roman followers . The other seven books contain nothing of value to the architect ; and these three indeed give us no Just pic  --  ture of the working methods of the real Greek and Roman architects , but rather of those of the mechanical copyist who , failing of inventive ability , seeks to reduce all de  --  sign to definite formulae . Such men live in all ages ; and that they lived in Greece is evidenced by the sources from which Vitru  --  vius drew his own rules . That they abounded in Rome is clear from the fact that Vitru  --  vius thought it worth while to write the book before us ; but this fact must not be allowed to strengthen the all too common view that no real creative architects lived among the Romans ; the falsity of such a notion be  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , which display a remarkable fund of imagination and inventiveness in the development of the forms inherited from Greece That Vitruvius himself was one of these plodding copyists seems probable from his own statements , one of which ( p. 168 ) , be  --  ing of more than passing interest , may be quoted in full : For my part , Cmsar , I have never been eager to make money by my art , but have gone on the principle that slender means and a good reputation are preferable to wealth and disrepute For this reason , only a little celebrity has followed ; but still , my hope is that , with the publication of these books , I shall become known even to posterity , And it is not to be wondered at that I am so gen  --  erally unknown .
