Leaping and snarling like a small , vivacious cougar , Rev. William A. Sunday preached at the Coliseum , in St. Louis . It was the fifth week of the projected seven-week revival meeting ; Billy Sunday had signed up about 4,000 converts and he wanted some more . He gave a " sermon " on " The Three Crosses " and talked about the opera Faust , in which Marguerite , a pregnant girl , dies of broken-heart . Said Billy Sunday : <P> " How would this dame feel , this dame in the box , with the accordion chin , all dressed up in silk and diamonds , if ... she found her path obstructed by a real Marguerite ? . . . She can shed crocodile tears over the false Marguerite on the stage-Shed some real tears over the real ones , you big fraud ! " <P> In his next rodomontade , Evangelist Sunday became emphatic . " The Bible is a bloody book , " he roared , " It is a bloody Gospel . It is a bloody world . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't argue against sin . ...

" <P> <P> * Despite its context , this word was not , as many of Billy Sunday 's listeners no doubt imagined , a malaprop description of St. Louis vice . Nor was " bloody " used in its colloquial connotation . The new testament promulgates the theory that one person may atone for the sins of another ; even , by great suffering and great holiness , for the sins of many . Monasteries , contrary to common supposition , are founded upon this principle of substitution . Perhaps the most strikingly emotional element of Christianity , it often finds expression in urgent hymns such as " Washed in the Blood of the Lamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
