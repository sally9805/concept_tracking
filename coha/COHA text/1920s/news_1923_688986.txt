txt Bigotry and Equality . To the Editor of The New York Times : Concerning your correspondent 's statement that Salem did not burn witches but hanged some and smothered another , what difference does It make ? Were not the witches dead when the religious zealots of Salem got through with them , and is it much more comfortable being choked to death by hanging or being smothered to death than being burned at the stake ? The charge against Salem is not how she killed witches , but that she killed them . The blot on her history and her religious sanity is that she , put anybody to death for theological reasons . Concerning another correspondent 's proposal that we saY " Liberty , Fraternity and Solidarity " instead of " Liberty , Fraternity end Equality " because " Equality " adds no new idea to " the familiar phrase and " Solidarity " does . It seems to me that neither " Liberty " nor " Fraternity " covers In the popular thought what " Equality " does and therefore it should remain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fraternity " is brotherhood , but not necessarily equality . Equality " is opportunity similar to all other men to work out one 's own salvation in one 's own way as long as one obeys the laws .. " Fraternity " It seems to me Is a much better word than " Solidarity " for it allows us independence along with brotherliness . HENRY R. ROSE . Minister of Church of the Redeemer . Newark , N.
