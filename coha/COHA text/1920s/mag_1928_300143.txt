HUNGER FIGHTERS-Paul de Kruif*-Harcourt Brace ( $3.50 ) . <P> In the monotonous scientific pursuits of Microbe Hunters Paul de Kruif found sensationalism enough to titivate a large public-he demonstrated fascination in the perverse antics of microbes , drama in the stolid heroism of hunters . More of the same , Hunger Fighters is a trustworthy though ebullient account of certain other men of science , unappreciated breeders of sturdy grain , students of cattle diseases , discoverers of fashionable vitamins . If the author coyly attributes an exasperated scientist with a few cusswords , or jazzes his pages with other self-conscious slang , it is but in his honest endeavor to educate a sugar-coated public . He makes the best of the highspots : In stamping out the virulent hoof-and-mouth disease one inconspicuous scientist had millions of cattle killed and buried , to the funeral dirge of their owners ' vituperations . In the hilly North , where burial space was scarce , he drove sick cattle into the valley and blasted the mountainsides to fill in a natural grave . Warned that the curse had spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would scatter the rest , he directed silencers to be used on the guns . Hunters deprived of their prey stormed in wrath , bereaved cattlemen still grumbled , but the disease was stamped out . <P> <P> *Pronounce Krife.
