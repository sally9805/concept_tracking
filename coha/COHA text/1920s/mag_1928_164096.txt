Nebuchadnezzar lay in the sun and ate grass . And good grass it was in days when few footsteps crushed its tender shoots and no motor exhaust laid a blight upon it . Not only its hardships but also its responsibilities have so increased that science must come to its aid . Last fortnight the University of Illinois announced that its scientists would work-with Erlenmeyer flask and petrie dish-on the problem of maintaining a satisfactory turf on football fields . The athletic association will make a 90-square checkerboard out of the gridiron . Running in crosswise strips will be nine different grasses , old , new , domestic , foreign . Ten strips , each treated with a different amount and combination of fertilizer , will run lengthwise , cutting the grass at right angles , forming 90 differently treated little experimental football fields . <P> In the fall the team will practice on the 90 pigmy gridirons , giving them all the same rough treatment . At the end of the season , the grass which best holds up its head will be the chosen turf for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , grass is being scientifically studied . Messrs . Stump and Walter , turf technicians and theorists , having had long experience with golf courses and polo fields , now offer a formula giving the best combination of grass seeds to produce a proper landing field . <P> Last fortnight two plant explorers , Robert Louis Piemeisel and L. W. Kephart of the U. S. Department of Agriculture , who had been nine months questing for grass in Africa , returned with 160 varieties . They had suffered from extreme cold in the highlands of Kenya and Tanganyika , had gathered grass seeds within sight of glaciers 200 feet thick , had faced down an elephant in a bamboo jungle , had brought back with them samples of 75% of all the forage grasses of the region . Their hope is to lengthen the season of green pastures throughout the land , thereby reducing the cost of livestock in the U. S.
