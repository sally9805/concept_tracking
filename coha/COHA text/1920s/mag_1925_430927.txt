PROBABLY it is not safe to try to say what a feminist is , but I am convinced that there are at least two types . Both of them feel keenly tae discriminations society has imposed upon women through ages past and present , but as a result a difference comes in their attitude toward society ? in their sense of proportion . Most women who care greatly about the wrongs and handicaps under which women suffer are willing to admit the importance ? the equal importance ? of some other social injustices . They recognize , indeed , the interrelationship of the woman question with other great questions . I consider this a perfectly good kind of feminism . There are other women , however , who put the woman question first and above all other issues , and who seem to think that the solution of all others should be determined solely by what is done with women 's problems . This type of feminist insists upon woman 's rights no matter what happens to other rights . It is natural , then , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain other ways . The more moderate type will be the more practical woman , who sees and works with facts . The other type is the theorist , who with a single abstract principle in mind persistently ignores facts , clinging devotedly to abstractions . This difference between the practical and the theoretical woman is coming to be a serious matter in its effects upon the interests of the great mass of women wageearners . It is doubly serious because the woman at work for a livelihood is prevented , by the very confinement to her job , from being as articulate about herself and her problems as she might otherwise be , and as her non-wage-earning sisters , or any women more fortunately situated , not only can be but are . So we have over-articulate theorists attempting to solve the working women 's problems on a purely feministic basis , with the working woman 's own voice far less adequately heard . And these overarticulate , highly theoretical feminists are talking about things and conditions entirely outside their own experience or knowledge . More facts about industry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract feminist theorizing . Now I hope I have raised no doubts as to my own feminism . I consider myself a good feminist , but I believe I am a practical one . And I claim a right to discuss the problems of women in industry because I am myself one of those women , and it has been my job in life to understand my fellow workers , their conditions and their problems , group by group , trade by trade , state by state , and in this country as a whole . Eighteen years in a shoe factory are a practical experience which teaches one what the woman worker is up against . Seven years as an organizer of working women add a great deal to one 's understanding , and several more years of responsibility for investigating and depicting the conditions of the woman in industry to the public through a government bureau give one a keen appreciation of the interrelation of women 's problems with other problems . I am convinced that we can not , and we should not , attempt a ruthless  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman problem in industry is equally a labor problem . Equal rights and equal opportunities for women workers can not be separated from the question of industrial justice for all workers . Above all things , " rights " must be interpreted for women workers as something concrete , and we must start with the world where it is today ? not where it might have been had present industrial conditions - existed from the beginning . And now to a specific situation that confronts us : In two of our great industrial states , New York and Illinois , women are working hard to secure laws which will reduce the present 9-hour and ro-hour working days of women in factories and workshops to 8 per day or 48 per week . Working women are leaders in the movement in both states , so this is not a reform instigated by " outsiders . " The question is a vital one because the shorter working day is the most essential thing in the lives of industrial workers . It means opportunities for life and self-development which are shut out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job at which the day is spent . It means also more efficiency on the job and better service to the employer . So it seems like a cause upon which women would be united , and it has , in fact , the support of nearly all organized women . There are , however , some women in the opposition ; and because industrial questions are so widely misunderstood ? because , furthermore , a difference of opinion among women always draws a disproportionate amount of attention ? the opposition of this minority of women to the laws limiting hours of women workers has seriously confused some sections of the public and some legislators as to the actual issue involved . THE campaign for these 8-hour laws for women in New York and Illinois is the present stage of the movement for labor laws for women which received its great impetus some forty years ago when factory inspection first forcibly drew public attention to the widespread industrial evils which bore with peculiar severity upon women . Today all the states but one have some kind of labor law for women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such laws . Indirectly , the better standards of employment thus secured influence the hours of work and the wages or salary of practically all the nearly nine million gainfully occupied women in the United States . Some of the laws are weak ? permitting an 11-hour day in North Carolina , for example , and a 10-hour day in 16 states . But other states have gone far above this standard , and 9 of them have an 8-hour day or 48-hour week . while three more with a 9-hour day have a 48-hour week . Thirteen states have minimum wage laws for women , 16 have night work laws , others have laws requiring seats in stores , or otherwise lightening the conditions of employment for women . All such laws penalize employers , not the employees , for failure to conform to the standards . They are based upon the well understood fact that however fair and just the average employer , there exist always , in the absence of compulsory regulation , a laggard few who will not conform to standard and who therefore must be policed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects . Such labor laws are to employers a code for fair play in industry . For the workers and the community as a whole , they are primarily public health provisions . This entire body of law , however , is now under attack by certain ultra-feminists who argue that because the laws do not apply to  | men as well as women , they constitute a discrimination against women and a handicap to women 's economic advance . It is not the provisions of the laws they are opposed to , they say , but merely the limitation to women , and to demonstrate this they propose to amend pending 8-hour bills to make them apply to " all persons . " So the issue is reduced , as far as this group of opponents is concerned , to the question of what constitutes discrimination , and the further question of whether women shall have or not have something , merely because men have , or do not have it . Advocates of the laws believe that those laws are for the most part accomplishing a very necessary purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if not obtainable for the rest . Therefore , if there is discrimination , it is not women who are discriminated against by the laws . It is in industry itself that the discriminations occur , and the laws are equalizing in their effect , for the reason that they obtain for women certain economic rights and benefits which men already have in large measure attained . In other words , the laws for women remove a handicap ; and so far as progress is concerned , it is in the states that have good laws for women workers that there exist not only the best conditions for women in industry , but the most important examples of women 's advance into new fields of employment . FOR my own part , I believe in the laws because , for one thing , I know the meaning and the feeling of industrial fatigue . I know because throughout those years of my life in the factory I worked ro hours a day , six days a week , stitching shoes ; drawing $12 in my pay envelope after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our factory when the state legislature passed an 8-hour law for women factory workers in our state . This meant that the whole working force , men as well as women , went on an 8-hour schedule , because the women did . And I remember well our disappointment when the law was taken away after being in effect just one day ? taken away because the Supreme Court of the State declared it unconstitutional . Reasonable hours for the industrial worker mean all the difference between health , vigor , the capacity for enjoyment on the one hand , and on the other the horrors of exhaustion , physical ruin , and fear of the human scrap-heap . I have been speaking especially of 8-hour laws because they are the most necessary kind of labor laws for women , the most important kind of regulation to have for any worker . There are other hour regulations , however , of which night work laws are a more controversial example . They prohibit the employment of women on night shifts . It may be admitted , I think ? I for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of misapplication , and the most judicious care should be taken in the drafting of them . Since they have in view fundamentally the health and efficiency of the worker , and night work is usually a hardship , there is no question but that means of avoiding it are desirable for men and women both . Not equally necessary for men and women , however , because men and women do not occupy the same positions in the other half of their lives ? their domestic relations . Hence neither the individual nor social cost of night work for men is so high as for women . A woman at work in a factory , or anywhere outside her home , does not give up her household tasks . If she is married she has literally two full-time jobs when she works in the factory , for she does not earn enough to permit her to employ a servant or a housekeeper . A man does his day 's work in the factory , and his job is over for the day . His wife or his sister comes home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children , gets up  | in the morning , gets breakfast , does the housework , and goes out for another day at the factory . She does this unless she works at night in the factory . Then she does her housework during the day ? and gets her sleep when she can . There are , according to the Census , 2,000,000 married women in the United States gainfully occupied . Great numbers of them , mothers of little children . lead some such abnormal life as described above . The night-work laws do not solve their problem , we know . But they do lead to adjustments in industry whereby women get the day shifts , and they do serve , we believe , the greatest good of the greatest number . They can , in all cases , undoubtedly be drawn with exemptions to obviate especial hardships . Such is the teaching of experience as I see it with reference to night work laws . They should not be abolished , but further studied and perfected . The Women 's Bureau is engaged in such studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws ? minimum wage laws . These are based upon the principle that an industry should pay its own way , without subsidy from the workers in the form of unpaid-for service . A wage less than enough to support the individual requires a contribution from some source to make up the cost of living , and if the employer does not pay a living wage the worker 's family or the community pays the deficit ? unless the worker goes under-nourished and under-caredfor . So the minimum wage law provides that employers in designated industries shall pay at least a living wage to any woman they employ , and usually a commission is created to determine , upon the basis of ascertained facts , what is the minimum necessary to keep the worker in health and reasonable comfort . These commissions consist of representatives of employers , employees , and the public , and they base their findings on the cost of living . All these kinds of regulatory laws have been obtainable for women because women 's special needs were more evident to the public than were the needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the importance of conserving the health of the actual and potential mothers of future generations . A similar demand for laws for men did not exist for several reasons . Chief of these was and is the fact that men in general work under much better conditions than women ; where they work at night they can sleep in the day , and there are in any event no such double demands upon their energies as upon the wage-earning wife and mother ; and , though men 's wages are too often very low , they are never , I think we can safely say , as low as women 's . The ditch-digger , the coal-heaver ? any of the very least skilled of men ? draw a better wage than do thousands of skilled and semi-skilled women ! . Porters and messengers in factories I know of are paid more than women who manufacture the products the men cart around on trucks . It is facts like these that make foolish the feminist claim that minimum wage laws . for instance , work discrimination by causing women to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general are poorer jobs than any man could be induced to take . Men , by the selfaction of tradition if for no other reason , can always command more pay and usually better hours than women . Why feminists ignore this fact I never could understand . Let me say at this point , however , that there is one type of law affecting women which I do not at " all defend . That is the prohibitory law which says that women shall not be employed in specified occupations . Such laws are in fact discriminatory , I agree , and should be repealed . Most of them are not of serious practical importance , however , for not many women 's ambitions or progress are inhibited by forbidding them to climb telegraph- poles , shine shoes ,  | read gas meters , or work in mines ? which are the chief kinds of prohibitions , and which , except mining , occur in only a state or two . These laws seem to be a relic of by-gone prudery rather than anything else . The prohibition against women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important in its effect , for women chauffeurs in Colorado , for example , have established businesses which illustrate the opportunity Ohio women might very well want to utilize . The hour laws and minimum wage laws are regulatory laws , fixing standards of employment . That is quite a different matter from prohibiting employment itself . But , our theoretical feminists say , " we stand on the principle that there should be no laws whatever that do not apply to men as well as to women . " That theory is good as a theory . If we could make a fresh start with the universe , laying out the whole program from the viewpoint of today , we might agree to have a rigid application of that abstract principle . But certain things have been going on in the world for a considerable time , and industry , as well as human minds , has got " set " in certain ways . Facing facts as we find them , a practical difficulty confronts us which is this : Conditions of life and of industry are such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours or 11 hours a day in the absence of the 8-hour law , men are at this same moment , in many industries , enjoying their 8-hour day , In other words it is not the 8-hour law , but the absence of the 8-hour law for women , that constitutes a discrimination against them as we see it . Similarly , women 's wages are very much lower than men 's ? will probably average little more than half as much . Minimum wage laws bring up the lowest wages at least within striking distance of an equality with men . Instead of being discriminatory against women , the minimum wage laws lessen the discrimination that already exists . WHAT the feminist objection to the labor laws for women is really based on is this : The labor laws for women put women on a different legal basis from men so far as their jobs are concerned , and to the ultra-feminist legal equality means almost everything . The worker prefers industrial equality , which is in this case actually defeated by legal equality . Labor laws limit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employer 's as well . A labor law limiting the woman worker 's technical freedom of contract seems to the feminist discriminatory because she does not know or does not realize how meaningless to the wage worker is the thing called " freedom of contract . " A man or woman dependent upon earnings has no real freedom of contract beyond the purchasing power of those earnings . Wage workers must have jobs in order to live , and their freedom to choose a job is determined by the amount of money they possess to buy their meals and pay their rent while they are looking for the better chance . Men think so little of their legal freedom of contract in its technical sense that they voluntarily surrender it by joining trade unions . That is the essential principle of a trade union ? the collective bargain as a substitute for individual freedom of contract . An 8-hour law , though it takes away the worker 's freedom to contract for more than 8 hours of work per day , gives in exchange the economic freedom that the additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation and selfdevelopment . It is a substitute for the voluntary limitation through the trade union thus a sort of collective bargain made throng , - the machinery of the state . It is a historical fact , however , that working , men have always preferred to get their 8-hour day by making their own agreements witltheir employers through their trade unions  | and thereby avoiding the machinery of the state . Generally speaking , the organized labor movement is so opposed to having men 's wages and hours fixed by law , that any attempt to write the word " persons " into labor laws proposed for women would align the trade union men against that law , insuring its defeat . So there is one fact to face . Working women , however , are most inadequately organized in all of the great womenemploying industries but one . That is another fact to face . These women , then , whose problems are acute and vital , can either use their new tool , the ballot , and with the cooperation of other voters , women and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can wait for their 8-hour day until they are themselves sufficiently organized to bargain for it with their employers . Or they can go on working q or io or i r hours a day . An 8-hour law , or any other law , comes in recognition of a public demand . All women , and all men , by their votes may help to secure legislation . But if the working woman is to depend upon collective bargaining alone , she must go upon her own and do without help from other women or other men except her fellow-workers . The collective bargain is made between employer and employees . NOW our theoretical feminists are very strong , theoretically , for organization of women workers into trade unions . They are equally inexperienced in organization problems . " Let women do what men have done , " they say , adding in effect , with delightful inconsistency : " We who are not ourselves industrial workers , demand in the name of equality that you women who work in factories and shops shall use men 's methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the same method men prefer , whether you find that method best or most suitable for you or not . Otherwise we will prevent your getting it at all . Although the laws you want do not apply to us , it is against our principles to let you have them unless you conform to men 's ways or else convert the entire labor movement to the support of the same kinds of laws for all sections of labor . " With which dictum they proceed to the legislature and declare it to be against women 's interest to have any law applying to women that does not also apply to men . I agree that it is above all things desirable for working women to organize , and I have testified to my belief in trade unionism by working for years as an organizer for the National Women 's Trade Union League and the American Federation of Labor . Slowly the working women are realizing the importance of collective action for themselves , and there has been a 20 percent increase of women in trade unions in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still millions of women outside the trade unions , and those millions whose hours are disastrously long and whose wages are less than enough to live on are dragging constantly at the standards of the women better situated , and actually impeding organization as well as better standards . It is not always recognized that the farther down the worker is in the economic scale , the harder it is to organize ? yet this is proved by the lack of organization among the lowest paid men workers all over the world . It is the dreadful vicious circle ? the groups at the bottom can not improve their conditions because they are not organized , and they can not organize because their poverty is so great they dare not risk the loss of the miserable jobs they have . For be it remembered that the right to organize is not conceded by employers of the kind who are willing to exploit working people ? on the contrary , it is too often bitterly fought . There are other obstacles to organization among women , however , besides the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale . About one-fifth of the " women " in industry are under 20 . The young girl , as a rule , does not consider herself a permanent wage worker . She thinks she will marry , and sees no reason why , for the few years she will be working , she should pay clues to a trade union . She has not yet awakened to her responsibilities to her fellow-workers . But perhaps the biggest difficulty in organizing working women is that most of them fall into the groups of the semi-skilled , or socalled unskilled . Whether men or women , such groups are slow to organize , and even when they do form unions , the high turnover and seasons of unemployment among the relatively unskilled workers keep their organizations unstable . Still another factor of difficulty for the organizer is the high percentage of married women in industry , many of these working irregularly or on part time , with the idea of supplementing their husbands ' earnings , rather than making an independent living wage . These women , who constitute a fourth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow to organize , or to use collective methods . Altogether the organization of working women to the point of preventing long hours and lower wages than men 's is a matter of a long time hence . MEANTIDIE , our feminist opponents do not fail , of course , to offer testimony which i they claim proves the discriminatory effect of the labor laws for women . They say , for one thing , that businesses and professions do not observe the 8-hour day , and if there is an S-hour law for women , men will get the salaried positions that would otherwise be open to women . It is impossible for this to be true , for the reason that S-hour laws for women almost never have applied , and they never need be made to apply , to businesses and professions , or to executive positions . Some of the strongest advocates of labor laws for women are business and professional women . But of those who oppose , it seems both reasonable and fair to ask that they leave it to the industrial worker to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for each group to work out its own standards and methods , and to cooperate to their respective ends and purposes , without conflict . The industrial workers ' problems are the collective problems of a great mass of women doing similar or identical work , largely routine . There is not room for more than a few of these women to become forewomen or managers , and the rest of them must remain in the ranks all their working days . Their jobs are usually dull , monotonous toil , not stimulating to mind or body , and lacking almost entirely the creative interest that goes with the job of the business or professional woman . The only compensation for a life of this kind is a workday sufficiently short to permit relaxation and self-development . The business or professional woman has an individualized job , which naturally develops in her an individualistic viewpoint . Neither the collective bargain nor the collective principle represented in the labor laws so readily occurs to her for the solution of her own problems . The consequence is that she sometimes attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon whom it inflicts a serious hardship . Then there are certain other contentions against the laws that are no better founded than this I have mentioned . It has been testified before the New York legislature , for instance , that the 8-hour law of the District of Columbia caused women in laundries and in restaurants to lose their jobs and be replaced by men . The authentic facts are that the 1920 Census showed almost exactly twice  | as many women employed in laundries as shown by the Census before the law was passed , and the proportion of women and men was exactly the same . As to waitresses , the numbers in the District of Columbia increased several times more than the numbers of men . It was also stated that the minimum wage law of the District caused the discharge of women in favor of men . Here again , certified pay-roll records of identical establishments reporting periodically showed increases in the numbers of women during the time the law was in effect , and when it was finally declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the industries affected by the law than there had been before . ANOTHER striking piece of evidence showing that the claims of opponents are not borne out upon investigation is furnished by comparison of numbers of women employed in states which have and states which have not legal regulations for the employment of women . California and Indiana were selected for this survey , which was made by the Women 's Bureau , because they have approximately equal population and a similar number and kind of industries employing women . California has an 8-hour law for women and also a minimum wage law which has fixed the highest minimum wages now in effect in the United States ; which is to say , has from the legal standpoint imposed the greatest restrictions upon the " freedom of contract " of women workers and their employers . Indiana has no law of either kind . The survey showed that more women are employed in California with its regulatory laws , than in Indiana with no regulations at all , and that the numbers in California have increased since the laws were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the claims that street railway companies could not continue to employ women if women 's hours were limited by law and men 's hours were not , or if women were prohibited from working at night . In the city of Chicago it was found that the street railway companies had entered into a voluntary agreement with the trade unions not to employ women at night , and to establish an 8-hour day . This agreement was forced by the women ticket sellers ? who stipulated in addition that men be barred from selling tickets on the Chicago elevated lines between the hours of 7 A. M. and 3 P. M .. and in allotted stations only between 3 P. M. and r r F. w . No women were dismissed as a result of this arrangement . They kept their jobs and the hour schedules for all ' employees were adjusted , women working only the day shifts . These facts are especially interesting in view of the claim loudly voiced in New York City that " thousands of women " lost their jobs as a result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bureau of Women in Industry of the New York Department of Labor investigated this situation , and found that what really happened was that the women employees had been taken on during the war in place of men ; that the company had begun dismissing the women in wholesale groups several months before the law in question was ever proposed in the legislature ; that it continued this policy of dismissal between the time this law was proposed and the time it was passed ; and likewise continued the policy to dismissals after the law was passed ? giving the law as the reason for so doing . That it could have adjusted the shifts if it wanted to retain these women is scarcely open to doubt . Another New York case is that of the woman printers , in whose behalf the night work law was amended . Investigation showed that 8 women regularly employed in newspaper printing plants in New York City , and to others who worked one night a week , would no longer be allowed to work at night , because , it  | developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the category of a factory , and the law was intended to cover factory workers . The law was amended in 1921 to exempt this type of work , and since that date only 3 women , so far as known , have taken advantage of their opportunity to work on night shifts . WHAT usually happens when laws restricting hours of employment are passed , and what almost always can happen , is the adjustment of industry to meet the law . This is what intelligent and fair-minded employers are glad to do , and a law which brings their competitors in line makes it feasible for them to do it . Women have proved their value to industry , and there is not the remotest probability of their being ejected from it . On the contrary , their numbers are increasing constantly , and when a law is made regulating their employment , it serves to bring the whole industry up to the standard required for the women working in it . The whole question , it seems to me , comes down to this : Shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less pay than men , and continue doing two jobs to their husbands ' one ? And is that sort of thing to continue in the name of some principle of equality ? Or shall we agree that the reality of better conditions of employment is more important , both to health and to industrial equality , than is a cherished theory ? Women who are wage-earners with one job in the factory and another in the home have little time and energy left to carry on the fight to better their economic status . They need the help of other women , and they need labor laws . Such laws are a safeguard not only to women but also to the children . They give protection to the family and maintain more satisfactory standards of living . In short , they help to make the country a better place for its citizens .  |
