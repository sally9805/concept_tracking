txt Buying of typewriters is at high rate , and so far as can be judged from the typewriter industry  --  a recognized barometer  --  good general business is to be expected this winter . With typewriters being sold as fast as made , factories , taking the industry as a whole , are operating at between 85% and 90% of peak capacity of 600,000 machines a yea ; which would make most of them at normal full-time putput . Three of the largest companies report sales so far this year larger than for any other year except 1920 , record year for the industry . Not only is there no accumulation of stocks going on , but amount of business on books is encouraging . Summer business for the leading companies was unusually good , with most companies reporting August sales largest for any August in their history . Operations are about 10% above last fall and compare well with spring . Men prominent in the trade agree in viewing the winter months as promising good business , possibly as good as last spring . GOOD FALL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-stock of typewriters and are again buying in normal volume . An encouraging feature is good buying of both portables and large machines for home use . This indicates not only wider apprethation of the advantages of the writing machine , but also good national buying power for the country and is in line with the high rate at which savings accounts have been growing this years Rentals are conspicuously fewer than a year or two ago . Foreign sales of large machines make up about 30% of the total compared with normal pre-war export of 40% and high of around 50% . Foreign sales continue to show slow improvement , varying greatly with the different countries . ' One large company reports export sales as 40% of its total , which , considering increased output today , would make foreign buying little less for this comparty than pre-war peak . Exports of $9,322,192 for the first eight months of this year compared with $7,529,001 for similar period in 1913 and $8,095,039 in 1912 ; prewar peak . Domestic business is fully twice as good as pre-war and shows the encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections . Almost invariably any district that has been buying relatively more than usual has been underbuying for several months past . If anything , the west is buying slightly better than the east , but as a whole the indication is a widespread dition of good general business .. Demand for accounting machines is especially large , another indication of favorable industrial conditions . PORTABLE SALES , LARGE Portable sales are excellent and leading makers report business in that line fully as good , if not better than last spring . Output is dose to a rate of 200,000 machines a year , with the largest maker producing about half the total . This is about a record for portable business and shows the increasing appreciation of the small typewriter . Exports of portable machines make up 20 to 25% of the total business . Here again a slow but steady increase in foreign buying is being shown . Earnings for the , different leading companies are good and indications are that 1923 earnings for the industry will compare well with the banner year of 1920 . All the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash position , so that just as the typewriter industry is expecting good buying of its products ether industries can expect better than normal buying of raw materials by the typewriter companies . Assuming present output of all standard makes of large machines to be at the rate of about 525,000 machines a year , and work of making a portable to be about half that of manufacturing a large machine , the industry , standard and portable , is operating at an equivalent of about 626,000 large machines a year . This would compare with a pre-war output figured on the same basis of about 260,000 machines , indicating that the typewriterp industry is about 140% above pre-war rate .
