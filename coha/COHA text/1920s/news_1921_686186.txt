txt During the war period shareholders of many corporations were deceived into believing that their respective companies were piling up great cash surpluses out of earnings . Later on when great deficits began to make their appearance , they began to realize that these war earnings were book profits only  --  a result of inflated inventories . With the deflation in inventories came an awakening , and many companies in 1920 were forced to charge against earnings because of the great shrinkage in market prices of raw materials on hand , losses that wiped out the greater part of their bookkeeping surplus accumulations . ' The leather trade was hit hard last year as a result of book profits reported during the war period . As an example , Central Leather accumulated a surplus after dividends in the five years ended December 31 , 1919 , of more than $20,000,000 . In the first three quarters of last year , there was a deficit of more than $13,000,000 as a result of inventory loss . It is believed that further large losses were sustained in the fourth quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to charge off heavily as a result of inventory losses . The president cf one of the largest and most ably managed industrial corporations in the country , has written the following article on book profits and inventories , for Dow . Jones &; Co. : " Prior to the war , our company divided its inventories into normal stocks and excess above normal . The normal stocks were valued at the lowest price reached by metals in the year 1914 . The excess above normal were valued at cost . The normal stocks never change  --  either in quantity or the value placed thereon . The excess above normal varies in quantity and price according to the facts . In case of an encroachment upon the normal stock at any branch , creating a deficiency , a reserve is created in the normal stock inventory , sufficient to buy the amount of such deficiency at the replacement value of the metal at that time  --  the first metal purchase being used to make good the deficiency in the normal stock . " In fixing the amount of normal stocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . The amount of metal normally in transit to ou : factories . " 2 . The amount of raw metal necessary in the factories to prevent possible stoppage of manufacturing , dui to transportation or other difficulties . " 3 . The amount of metal in process of manufacture , which in the case of one grade of metal extends over about five months. - " 4 . The amount of manufactured products necessary to carry in stock at factories and warehouses , in order to make Prompt , delivery . " The result is that abouto90% , of our total inventories is in normal stocks , the inventory price of which has not varied in the last seven years . Inasmuch as the purchases of raw material from month to month approximately egeal our sales of metal in the form of manufactured products from month to month , we adopt the fiction : that the metal sold in the form of manufactured products during any given month was made out of the metal bought during that month , and the normal stock is never touched , and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical purposes , the normal stock is like a piece of machinery which the company has to have always on hand in order to operate . When the price of one grade of metal , for instance , went to a certain price per pound , we could not make an actual profit thereon without selling its normal stocks ; but , in that event , it would either have had to buy back such normal stocks at the then market , or go out of business . In the latter case it would lose the value of its goodwill and the cost of marketing , which would be far greater than any possible profit on sales . " This being true , we do not deceive ourselves by marking up inventory values and taking book profits , upon which we could not realize , to be followed later by book losses which we in fact do not suffer . Bookkeeping is likely to affect policy . By taking book'profits on ascending markets of raw material , a company is likely to be led into extravagance and wastefulness . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets are likely to he discouraging . Our stockholders are also likely to be deceived by apparent high earnings followed by severe losses , if such book profits and losses are reported in our published statements . " The advantage to the company of this safe and conservative method of taking inventories has been made manifest during the last few years . For instance  --  the market price of one grade of metal advanced from the low price ruling in the years 1913 and 1914 to 11 cents for higher ) during the war years ; and on December 31 , 1920. it had fallen to 4.75 cents . Inasmuch as we have never taken any book profits . we do not now have to take any book losses . It would have been just as reasonable to mark up the value of our plants and machinery to the replacement value thereof during the war years ( with a consequent showing of book profits ) . and then write them down to present replacement values ( with a consequent showing of book losses ) , as to make similar variations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our excess above normal stocks ? which have always been inventoried at actual cost until written down to the market on December 31. 1920 ? we have ( like all others who have inventoried at market or cost ? whichever is lower ) made some profits and losses . But these are inconsequential and will not materially affect our annual earnings , which we hope will continue to be fairly uniform . "
