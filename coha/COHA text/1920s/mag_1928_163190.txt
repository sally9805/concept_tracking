Driving sharply eastward over the North Atlantic last week but kept apart by the watery curve of the days were two great U. S. steelmakers . The first was James Augustine Farrell , 65 , since 1911 president of the U. S. Steel Corp . The second was Charles Michael Schwab , 66 , the first ( 1901-04 ) president of the U. S. Steel , now chairman of Bethlehem Steel. * Mr. Schwab was going to England to receive the Bessemer Medal ; Mr. Farrell was going to Italy for health &; pleasure . He had worked 18 years without surcease and now he needed recuperation . <P> Unfortunately , he felt , the voyage kept him away from the 15th annual convention of the National Foreign Trade Council at Houston last week . He had founded the organization and never before had failed its meetings . And this one was especially important because it dealt with U. S.-Latin America trade relations . Fourteen hundred delegates were at Houston . Don Carlos G. Davila , Ambassador from Chile to the U. S. flew by airplane from Montgomery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. businessmen there the wisdom of investing in Latin American companies , and leaving the Latin Americans in control . <P> However , Mr. Farrell had written out some quid pro quo arguments of the mutual benefits in U. S.-Latin America trade , which in his absence were read to the convention . The Latins present understood his links of thought ; and approved them . <P> <P> * William Ellis Corey , 62 , the intervening ( 1903-11 ) U. S. Steel president , heads no concern ; directs several of the most potent of their kind-American Banknote , Baldwin Locomotive , Bethlehem Steel , International Nickel , Mack Trucks , Montana Power . . . . When in the U. S. he lives on Fifth Avenue , close to Manhattan 's Metropolitan Art Museum .
