txt For two hours today a Senate storm raged around Senator Heflin of Alabama , who started a rumpus yesterday by violent remarks and assertions that he was one Senator who would never represent the " bond sharks of Wall Street " in the Congress of the United States . Twice during the day he was formally rebuked by vote , once because of the language he used in reference to Senator Wadsworth yesterday and again for his statements in another vitriolic speech today during which he assailed Senator Couzens , In both cases his statements were expunged . The Senator from Michigan retorted to the Alabama man in similar strong language , resulting in the most bitter exchange of the session . Senator Couzens 's talk was likewise expunged from The Record with the statements of Heflin . When the Senate convened it had before it a motion made by Senator Lodge late in yesterday 's session to Lay on the table an appeal that Senator Robinson had taken from the Vice President 's ruling , sustaining Mr , Lodge 's point of order that Senator Heflin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharks and big financiers of Wall Street " was an utterance that imputed " unworthy and unbecoming conduct " to Senators of the United States . The motion to table was not debatable and was carried by a vote of 40 to 23 . All who voted to sustain the chair were Republicans , while six Republicans , LaFollette , Brookhart , Norris , Capper , Johnson and Ladd , all of the Progressive radical group , voted with the Democrats in favor of Mr. Heflin . . Heflin Revised His Remarks . Senator Wadsworth rose as soon as the vote was announced and proceeded to call attention to the fact that the report of yesterday 's wrangle as it appeared in this morning 's Congressional Record was not a reproduction of the official stenographic ) record . In some instances . Senator Heflin had changed words and in a few other instances inserted new sentences . It was probably the most thorough expose of the senatorial practice of revamping speeches that has ever been made . " In the colloquy which occurred near the close of the session yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest against one of the statements which came to my ears as I sat on the floor from the Senator from Alabama relating to the Chief Justice of the United States . In looking over the Record this morning to ascertain if that language could be identified and located , and in looking over the stenographer 's copy I have come to the conclusion that it is rather difficult , upon reading the Congressional Record as printed , to ascertain exactly what was said or what did happen . " I have before me portions of the stenographer 's record . Some of the changes which have been made are comparatively unimportant . Some are amusing . " For example , I find on page 2,858 at the conclusion of a paragraph commencing with the words ' Mr. Heflin ' and ending with the phrase ' you stand on the housetop and crow like a rooster , ' that the word ' laughter ' is inserted . The word ' laughter is inserted upon the stenographer 's record in the handwriting of the Senator from Alabama . " Part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks by Inference , perhaps , sometimes , directly , by the Senator from Alabama upon the people of other States . ' The stenographer 's record shows that Ii , one of the utterances of the Senator from Alabama there appears this sentence : ' New York does so much devilment , I have no time to remember anything that she does . ' Now . I heard that said . The stenographers heard it said . The Senator from Alabama has stricken it from the Record . " He then called attention to the Record 's report of the colloquy between himself and Senator Heflin , wherein , he declared , Heflin had altered a reference to Chief Justice Taft so as to avoid an objectionable inference which was apparent In his original remarks . " This , is in the main not important . " said Senator Wadsworth , " but it shows that you can not always tell what a Senator says by reading the Congressional Record . " Stelitted on " Wall Street'e Toes . " When Senator Wadsworth concluded , Senator Heflin demanded the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted him back in order . S-nator Robinson contended that the incident concerning yesterday 's proceedings ended when the Senate voted to sustain the ruling of the Chair . In the end this was accepted as the solution of the Problem . Senator Heflin then started another tirade . He declared that " free speech " on the floor of the Senate was threatened . He shouted that he represented the masses of the American people and intended to have his say . He bitterly assailed the Senators who had voted to sustain the Vice President , and proclaimed pride in the fact that La Follette , Norris and other progressives had stood by him . Concerning his corrections for the Record , he-said : " I did ' make corrections in my speech in the heat of debate , we do it every day . We tone down our remarks somewhat . " Ho asserted that the Vice President never batted an eye when Senator Lenroot imputed Soviet leanings to Mr. Brookhart . As to making any apology to the Senate , he ' said he " would see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll-c.a3 showed he had " stepped on the toes of Wall Street . " Then he went on : There has never been a time when the money power was stronger than today in the national capital . It is , ntrenched in the Capitol and flourishes ' on every avenue . The man of the big purse is the man of power in the Republican Party . " Several of the Senators who voted to support the ruling had been recommended to him is progressives , declared Mr. Heflin , adding that " he had his doubts all along . " Then he said : " I was told one of them was a progressive , but he is a millionaire many times over . I said , ' Say that to me again , and say it slow ' and they said It again . I shook my head and said , ' It will crop out on him ; mark what I tell you : he will vote some time ; when the big interests are attacked you will see him go over and take his place among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw him do it this morning ? my good friend Couzens from Michigan , parading himself down here as a progressive , and this morning he walked right over and sat right up under the whiskers of the Senator from Massachussetts . Centeno in Angrx Retort . Senator Couzens his face showing anger , rose to a question of personal privilege . " We went through something of this character yesterday " he said . " when the Senator from Alabama made free to make reference to Senators from other States , in which the Senator apparently imputed improper motives to Senators from other States , " It was developed by the Senator from New York that after the speech had been made and the gallery had heard the speech of the Senator from Alabama ( and it is the gallery he seems to be playing to a.11 the time ) he had gone in the nighttime and changed his speech , made before the gallery , to some other language so that the record would not show what he had really said before the Senate . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nighttime in the dark and change the references that he had made to myself . I want him on the floor to change that record now , or to have it expunged from the recordentirely . I voted to sustain the chair because I object to any Senator getting upon the floor and impugning the motives of any other Senator . If Senators are free to get up here - and tell the galleries and the American people that the motives of a Senator from any State are to be questioned , and that they are to be aligned with some special interests , then we might just as well stand up here and call everybody thieves and Hats . " I want the record clear as we go along , and not let any man in the night time go around and change the record and have it read as he ? : nay choose . I now request that the statement with reference to myself be expunged from the record . " Mr. Heflin , to whom Senator Underwood had been talking , said he was willing to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Couzens would permit what he had said to be expunged . Senator Couzens said he would not withdraw one word that he had uttered Senator Underwood then stepped into the breach , saying , in part : 6 , My colleague has indicated that he is prepared to ask the Senate to withdraw the remarks he made against the Senator from Michigan . Of course , I do not justify the remarks the Senator from Michigan has made in reply , although there may be some warrant for them in what my colleague said in regard to . him . but that does not justify his position . I am sure that when the Senator from Michigan has had more experience on the floor of the Senate he will realize that this is a place where difficulties among gentlemen should be settled in an amicable way , and not by trying to drive one into an unenviable position . " We do not want to start a roughhouse in the - United States Senate . I want to see this incident closed , and I hope the Senate will sustain me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the , Senator from Michigan at the same time that the remarks of my colleague are excluded . " Senators Lodge , Lenroot . Watson and other Republican leaders persuaded Mr. Couzens to agree , so the remarks of both Senators were expunged from the record .
