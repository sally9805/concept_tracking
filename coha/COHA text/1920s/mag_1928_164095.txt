Speedy . A tiny , tinny taxicab is speeding up the island of Manhattan , giving pedestrians the jumps , passing street cars on the wrong side on Broadway , dodging busses on Fifth Avenue like a squirrel full of applejack . In the back seat is George Herman ( " Babe " ) Ruth who , judging by the expression on his face , is being taken for a remarkable ride . In the driver 's seat is Harold Lloyd , grinning stupidly at his fat and famed passenger instead of watching the traffic . However , they do get to the ball game on time and Mr. Ruth knocks out a four-bagger . The ride , as well as most of Speedy , was actually filmed in Manhattan 's streets in high afternoon . Mr. Lloyd is a city cowboy , who likes baseball , gets fired from many jobs , takes his girl to Coney Island on Sunday . Her grandfather owns and operates the last horse car in an obscure section of the city . A rapid transit potentate hires a gang of thugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and drives it home like an elephant full of applejack . This film is roaringly funny-though there is no doubt that if Harold Lloyd and Charles Chaplin were put on a platform without any mechanical devices , Mr. Chaplin would get 90% of the laughs . <P> Stand and Deliver . Greta Garbo is pretty . Gloria Swanson is pretty and sometimes funny . Lupe Velez is pretty and always funny . According to one school of thought , that is what every cinemactress should be . Little Lupe did her first major funny-business as the woodland roughneck who tweaked the cheeks of Douglas Fairbanks in The Gaucho . In this new Stand and Deliver she does just about the same thing to Rod La Rocque , though her friskiness is less vigorous and her panting is indeed tremendous when the villain gets after her . Mr. La Rocque plays a misogynist , who goes bandit-hunting in Greece to escape boredom in his London club . He saves the life of little Lupe and , after that , he just ca n't get rid of her . When his commanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer in the jaw and , plotfully , kills him . So Mr. La Rocque runs away to the mountains with little Lupe hanging picturesquely on his neck . They are captured by the laughing bandit king , Ghika ( Warner Oland ) , who has a nest on top of a mountain , reached by a mule-operated basket elevator . Ghika , with his eye on little Lupe , takes Mr. La Rocque into his gang . But , after much diverting muleplay , Mr. La Rocque brings Ghika into the arms of the law , and little Lupe brings Mr. La Rocque into her own arms .
