txt The carpenters ' district council announced last night that Its . executive board has rejected the offer of a 20 per cent cut in wages made by the Associated Builders , with a view of breaking the building deadlock . The union Chiefs are preparing , a counter proposal . The then declare they will not agree to a wage reduction , and that the first chopping of building costs ought to be in materials and In interest charges . Thus the controversy has chased its own tail-around the circle and is back again to the original , starting point of last November . With this difference , however , the ice has been broken on the question of a definite wage cut . The builders propose to take off 25 cents an hour from the pay of skilled workers , effective May 1 . It would trim wages from $1.25 an hour , the highest in the country , to ; 1 an hour . Its effect would be to cut off the raise of " two bits " an hour which was tacked on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago . To Cut Common Labor to 70 Cents . On common labor the , rate would fall from $1 an hour to 70 ' cents . It was put up to the carpenters ten days ago , after the contractors had held back a month or more , expecting some sort of offer might come from the men themselves as a business reviver . At present the industry is dead as a rusty doornail , and 45,000 building craftsmen and laborers are estimated to be out of employment . Some skilled workers have gone to other kinds of jobs . Many are redorted to be working for 70 cents an hour as common laborers , and the argument of the builders is that a cut in wages would reduce building costs to a point where work would revivf and return the idle to employment , besides throwing out a lifeline to contractors . The builders declare that when the extra 25 cents was granted last spring the understanding was that it would be knocked off when living costs came down . The proposed cut , they say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living has receded to the level of the armistice period of 1913 . Calls Reductions Minter:de . Similar reductions are ' soon to be proposed to the masons and bricklaVers. and other crafts . The plasterers have already signed up their contract at the rate of $1.25 an hour , but builders declare it was on the understanding that the rate should be reduced if the basic wage for the masons is lowered . " The wage reductions suggested are moderate , " said William Schlake , general manager of the Associated Builders . " Labor Is merely asked to relinquish its latest increase , given when living costs were at their peak . " The cost of building is practically all labor . Prices ' of brick , lumber , stone , lime , cement , iron , are high because of the labor costs . Similarly , transportation , for freight is largely a I matter of labor . High rents are due to lack of houses and apartments . New building will reduce rents , and if ' there is no building rents will go higher. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What the Unions Say . An unofficial statement last night gave the position of the unions as follows : " The building trades will not take a reduction . The cost of living has not receded to the point indicated by the government 's figures . But even the government 's figures show living costs 90 per cent above normal . And wages in the building crafts have risen only SO per cent . Furthermore , a reduction of wages to $1 an hour would reduce building costs less than 3 per cent . Why try to liquidate labor without first liquidating building supplies and interest charges ? " Ask City Investigation . Meanwhile the Expert Builders ' association met in the county building , - Robert Isham Randolph presiding . It . voted to ask  --  Mayor Thompson to appoint a committee of seven , composed of two representatives of labor , one of materials , one contractor , two aldermen , and the building commissioner . It would hold hearings to fix " fair price " for commodities , labor , and credIts , the theory being that:the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building activities are a . lead . duck .
