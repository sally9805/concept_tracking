Their Majesties sipped tea , last week , in crumpet passing proximity to Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ford . The chat waxed cordial and lasted for two hours . It took place neither at punctilious Buckingham Palace nor in the spacious hotel suite of Henry Ford ( TIME , April 16 ) . Royalty &; Fords met before the cozy country hearth of famed Viscountess Astor at Cliveden , 20 miles from London . She , vivacious , hospitable , bred in Virginia , but now a British peeress and M. P. , seemed the ideal international hostess . Gossip told that the conversation of Her Majesty and Mrs. Ford was at all times stately , that the men eventually shared a chuckle , too . <P> Prior to his high tea at Cliveden , Motor Man Ford sojourned idly in London , delaying his projected tour of the British Isles , but found time to extemporize to the press as follows : <P> " Unemployment in England is caused by not paying enough wages . Good production 's the thing . People are afraid to want things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To those who say this will produce idleness , the reply is it 's just the other way . It will produce work . For making machines means making more machines , and consequently you have more production and better wages . " <P> The Laborite Daily Herald , enthusiastic at these words , headlined across an entire page : " Henry Ford on the Evil of Low Wages-Unemployment in England Due to Low Wages . " <P> Mr. Ford also said : <P> " I know nothing about Russia , but it is a market-they have always paid me for my business . . . . " <P> " My experience is that no one can drink alcohol without injury . If people have to drink , they are done for as far as I am concerned . Smoking and drinking are both the same ; they destroy the brain cells . " <P> " I do n't believe in anything else but free trade all round . I do n't know what a tariff means , except that it means giving one crowd an advantage over another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough if you wo n't have competition . " <P> That Their Majesties were graciously pleased by Lady Astor 's U. S. guests , was made evident a few days later , when the court circular announced that Edward of Wales had received Mr. and Mrs. Ford in his bachelor home , St. James 's Palace .
