The Greenwich Village district of Manhattan has a typhoid epidemic . The 58th victim fell sick last week . All caught the disease indirectly from an old man , one Frederick Moersch , carpenter , who had been helping his widowed daughter run a Village ice cream parlor . He is a typhoid carrier , immune to the disease himself , infectious to others . The New York City health department captured him and segregated him on a pest island in East River . He may be kept there for life because he broke his promise to the health department never to work around food which other people might eat . A woman , " Typhoid " Mary Mallon , is also there for life , for like cause . <P> Each city of the U. S. , each county , each state , the nation , has its health officers . The most outstanding and efficacious is Surgeon General Hugh S. Gumming of the U. S. Public Health Service . Next to him may be ranked Health Commissioner Matthias Nicoll Jr . of New York State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City and Herman Niels Bundesen of Chicago . Both are now out of office-Dr . Harris because he got a better paying job with New York milk suppliers , Dr. Bundesen because he did not truckle sufficiently to Mayor " Big Bill " Thompson of Chicago . Other health officers sympathized so with Dr. Bundesen that they last year elected him president of their American Public Health Association . His successor as Chicago 's commissioner of health is Arnold Henry Kegel , who , technically untrained in public health work , is doing a fair job . In New York City Dr. Harris ' successor is Shirley W. Wynne , who not yet has had opportunity to show his worth in improving general public health . <P> Very few health officers have that ability to improve conditions . They do the established , approved things ; they watch water supplies , garbage disposals , food shop sanitation ; they quarantine infected persons ; they keep vital and epidemological statistics . They are mainly bureaucrats , jobholders . They must be constantly educated in their public health profession ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdictions ; they must be constantly pestered to teach their people selfhelp . And once a year they get those urgings in a massive dose . <P> The occasion this year took place in Chicago last week . The American Public Health Association met there ; and the American Child Health Association , the American Social Hygiene Association . Illinois Health Officers &; Public Health Nurses , The Women 's Foundation for Health , Association of Women in Public Health , State Sanitary Engineers , State Laboratory Directors ' Association , American Association of School Physicians . <P> At all meetings there was a plethora of papers read . The papers were cogent , instructive , inspiring ; but how effective they would be upon bureaucratic health officers was a common rhetorical question in many a Chicago hotel room .
