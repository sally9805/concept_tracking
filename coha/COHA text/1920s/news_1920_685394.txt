txt That prohibition . officers were used in Pennsylvania to elect delegates for Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer to the Democratic National Convention was charged today by Judge Eugene C. Bonniwell of the Philadelphia Municipal Court , before the Senate subcommittee investigating the election expenses of candidates for the Presidential nomination . Judge Bonniwell is head of the faction of Pennsylvania Democrats which opposed Mr. Palmer in the recent primaries , when Bonniwell was defeated for National Committeeman . Attorney General Palmer attended the afternoon session of the committee and made a vigorous denial of the charges , which Judge Bonniwell repeated . Charges and counter-charges relative to the personal character of the two witnesses flew fast over the witness table of the committee room in what is considered by members of the committee to have been the liveliest session since the hearing began . Judge Bonniwell charged the Palmer forces with granting - immunity to liquor men who violated the Volstead act and mentioned names . He said that permits to take liquor from bonded warehouses were issued -- like " passes to a public zoo " and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I told Mr. that he should permit the use of his name as a candidate as a means of protesting against the astounding misuse to which the powers of the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Department were being put in the interest of the Palmer candidacy , " Judge Bonniwell declared . " He said that he did not regard his candidacy as necessary . " Charges Big Outlay-for Palmer . " What was the situation with reference to the expenditure of money in that campaign ? " asked Senator Kenyon ; of Iowa , Chairman of the Subcommittee . " In Philadelphia 's 1,730 election divisions they put in $10 or more per division tor workers , and Charles Stuckart , Democratic County Chairman of Dauphin County , has estimated that the Palmer campaign cost between . $200,000 and $300,000 , " Judge Bonniwell replied . " Who was the head of their campaign ? " asked Senator Reed of Missouri . " Bruce Sterling was the Chairman , but there was a letter sent out by Robert S. Breit soliciting campaign funds from Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter . " Taken all in all , this Pennsylvania campaign resulted in the most ghastly and debasing degradation of the Federal Government in all history . " " Just what do you mean by that ? " Senator Kenyon asked . " Well , take Scranton , for instance , " Judge Bonniwell etplained . " I notice by this morning 's newspapers that the Mayor of the town is quoted as describing the community as the wettest district known outside the Atlantic Ocean . Breweries are running and distilled goods are handled openly . This is all under the jurisdiction of Roger Barnett , District Attorney and Palmer 's partner . Joseph O'Brien , the Democratic boss there , has always been an attorney for the wet interests . " " Are the breweries making beer and fhe distilleries operating ? " asked Senator Reed . " The brewers are making beer that boasts of more alcoholic content than one-half of one per cent . and the doors of the bonded warehouses containing distilled goods are very much open , " said the witness . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Government with a wholesome disrespect . " " Are they selling these goods right over the bar ? " asked the Senator . " Yes ; not only ' in the Wilkes-Barre district , but in Philadelphia , " was the answer . Says Liquor Laxity Beat Him . " And are these brewers and distillers associated politically with Mr. Palmer ? " asked Senator Kenyon . " Mr. A. J. Casey , a delegate at large on Mr. Palmer 's ticket , was one of the richest distillers in this district . Charles A. Fagan , another of the delegates at large , was an attorney for the brewers and distillers . " " What connection is there between the lack of law enforcement and the Palmer candidacy ? " The prohibition enforcement officer In this district I refer to is the Demouatic County Chairman , Grady by name . Another enforcement officer , Leo Crosson , is a brother-in-law of O'Brien , Palmer 's political boss . That is the Line-up of enforcement officers , from whom there is no appeal . Why , they move liquor around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Under what excuse do they move this liquor ? " asked Senator Reed . " They issue certificates of delivery as freely as they might issue passes to a public zoo , " said Judge Bonniwell . " It is transported to other States . " " And just how did this enter into the Presidential preference primary ? " asked Senator Kenyon . If it had n't been for this sudden laxity in the enforcement of prohibition I would have beaten that Palmer machine , and they know it . The best evidence of thatovas the fact that , in the midst of the campaign , the price of whisky went from $1,600 to $1,900 a barrel down to $900 a barrel in Philadelphia . " You keep on talking about Palmer reducing the price of whisky and renewing the brewing of beer and you fellows will elect him President , " Senator Reed remarked , laughing . " But it was reduced in price to the consumers , " said Judge Bonniwell . " They were charged 00 and 75 cents a drink for about seventy-five proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there of a connection between this movement and the Palmer candidacy ? " asked Senator Kenyon . Tells of Sudden Fortunes . " I need only point to the fact that four of Palmer 's chief supporters , Cornelius Dorrian , A. J. Casey and P. F. Cusack , all of Scranton , and Andrew Preslin of Summit Hill , made about $1,000,000 as a result of the situation . " Judge . Bonniwell said . " With the release of this liquor they opened headquarters in Philadelphia and laid down the lash on all saloon keepers who happened to be my political supporters . Their agents threatened to put one of my men , James H. Pierson , out of business if he did n't get into the Palmer bandwagon . " " Anything else along this line ? " was asked . " Only yesterday I learned of Federal agents levying assessments on hotel keepers , " said Judge Bonniwell . " I can refer you to Francis E. Walker , who saw 11.1 ; 50 check in the hands , of Park Davis , a Palmer leader . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will tell you a story of liquor orgies that will open your eyes . Why , these prohibition enforcement officers being convicted daily . " " There is a bitter feeling between you and Mr. Palmer . " suggested Senator Kenyon . I know him for what he is , " replied the Judge . " And are you what might be called a ' dry ' ? " asked Senator Reed . " I am against the Eighteenth Amendment and other encroachments upon personal liberties , but I think all selfrespecting citizens want to see laws enforced as long as they are such , " was the answer . Judge Bonniwell was recalled to the stand at the afternoon session to repeat in the presence of Attorney General Palmer the startling charges regarding the Pennsylvania primaries . He produced newspaper stories carrying the charge that the State was flooded with liquor . It is with an abiding conviction that I state that the support of men like Mr. Casey , the liquor rnan , and others of that type was taken away from me in the campaign by an agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " An agreement with whom ? " demanded Senator Reed . " Necessarily with the prohibition enforcement agents , " was the reply . " I have given you their names and am possessed of no second sight or detective agencies to run these things down . The State has been saturated and there has beer . no official protest or hindrance . ' " And what do you say was the effect ? " Scores of political supporters were ripped away from me when the bars were thus let down . The newspapers printed a story- or a man named Burgin , who claimed he was robbed of $5,000 in one of these liquor transactions . " " ' Were all of these prohibition agents appointed by Mr. Palmer ? " Undoubtedly , and in the palmy days of Quay the State never knew anything like this machine . " " Now I have called Mr. Palmer here in view of the serious charges made and I think he should be permitted to crossexamine the witness who makes the charges , " suggested Senator Reed . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he gets through I should like to make a statement , " said the Attorney General . " The most of your charges made here amount to inference , is n't that true , Judge Bonniwell ? " resumed Senator Spencer of Missouri , Republican . ' Well there has been no prosecution , while Pennsylvania roads are worn into ruts ' by whisky trucks ; is that inference ? " said Judge Bonniwell . " You and the Attorney General have been political rivals , have n't you ? " asked Senator Pomerene . " Does that alter the facts that the wheels of justice have been idle while this condition prevails ? " the witness asked in reply . " Can you give a single instance of your own knowledge ? " " The whole State of Pennsylvania knows it , " he said . " You are the Judge of a Court . What explanation have you to offer for the fact that offenders are not brought to justice ? " " Who would you file your complaints with ? " was the reply . Pennsylvania authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney General 's office . " Attorney General Palmer then took the stand . " Ordinarily I would not dignify statements of a wildness of this character , " said the Attorney General , " but when my personal and official integrity is attacked by men in the habit of indulging in character assassination I must say a word . If the statement were made In Pennsylvania , where it has been made many times and where the voters only recently passed upon it , I would say nothing . His word is no evidence of fact in Pennsylvania . In the recent primary every Bonniwell candidate was defeated , which might show you what the people of the State think . They know that the charges are based on animosity and not facts . " It all dates to 1918 , when this witness aspired to be Governor , I learned that hip nomination had been the result of a plan of the liquor interests in conjunction with a Republican leader . I caused the Democratic organization to repudiate him . Defeat has rankled him and with the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him or any one else to bring in a single bit of proof of any part of the charges . " During the campaign , as a matter of fact , many arrests were made in the very district where he says liquor has flowed . Furthermore , the arrest and detection of violators of the Volstead act is in no way a part of the duties of the Department of Justice . " Jdge Bonniwell denied the story that liquor interests had plotted to bring about his nomination for Governor on the Democratic ticket . " Senator Penrose , Republican leader , denied it and the specified liquor leader made as vehement denial , " Judge Bonniwell declared . " Despite this man 's efforts I was able to get 44,000 more votes in the State against Sproul than he could get as a candidate against Senator Penrose . " At the close of the hearing Senator Edge of New Jersey asked to be relieved from further duties , declaring that the committee had fulfilled its mission and was proving a vehicle for charges and countercharges between political foes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Associated Press ) . ? Investigation of the JohnsonHoover primary contest in California last month was resumed today by the . Senate committee inquiring into campaign expenditures , with J. H. Rosseter , formerly Director of Operations of the Shipping Board , as the first witness . Mr. Rosseter was Chairman of the California committee which raised funds for Senator Johnson . " We raised approximately $115,000 , " Mr. Rosseter said . " I understand the books will be produced here . " A budget had been made up , he continued , in the expectation " that $2,000 would be spent in each of ten primary States , " and altogether that $125,000 would be needed . " We started out to get contributions of $1,000 each , but found that impossible , " Mr. Rosseter continued , " so we tried to see how many of $2,500 each we could get . We got eight . We finally organized a committee of ten , each undertaking to raise $10,000 . " As time went on , and Mr. Hoover came in , we found that many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given $2,500 , and subsequently raised my contribution to $7,600 , which was the largest single amount coming to my knowledge . " Delegates from Southern California got up a little pool of their own ; I do n't know how much . As the Hoover campaid developed , we asked the Southern people to take care of themselves . " On May 18 , Mr. Rosseter said , the total Johnson fund " just failed to reach $125,000 . " " I had nothing to do with the small subscriptions , " he added . " which were still coming in when I left . " He noted J. B. Srhith of the King Coal Company , Utah , and " Mr. Miller of the Owl Drug Company , " each as contributors of $2,500 , in addition to others named by previous witnesses . W. H. Crocker and Herbert Fieishhacker , he said , had ended by raising their $2,500 subecriptIona to ; 4,000 . The committee also examined Edward Keating , former member of Congress from Colorado , and now manager of the Plumb Plan League . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign of any of the candidates for the Republican or Democratic Presidential nomination . " It is taking no part In the campaign , " he testified , " except as it is distributing information through its weekly paper , Labor . " ' " I 've rather gathered the impression that your paper is supporting for the Democratic nomination and Senator Johnson for the Republican , " said Chairman Kenyon . Mr. Keating replied that the paper had probably been more " critical of the other oandidates than these . " He added that the sixteen railroad labor unions supporting the league had a Campaign Committee of which he is a member , co-operating with the Campaign Committee of the American Federation of Labor , and that this committee had taken no part in the Presidential campaign . $12,000 a " Year for Plumb . Asked to explain the Plumb Plan League and its methods , Mr. Keating said that there were 4,000 railroad unions each paying $10 a year , and getting ten copies of ' Labor " and something more than 200,000 individuals each giving ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the cost of getting out the weekly went to propaganda , he said , supporting six field men . Glenn E. Plumb , he said , was on a salary , but he objected to giving the amount , declaring that the question was outside the scope of the investigation . Senator Reed insisted and Mr. Keating said that Plumb received $1,000 a month , " about one-half of his usual income , " as a lawyer in private practice , now abandoned . No Campaign , Says Mrs. Funk . Mrs. Antoinette Funk of Bloomington , Ill. , was ' questioned about a boom for . Chairman Kenyon told her that the committee was " having difficulty in locating the Democratic campaign for W. G. . " " The explanation is very simple , " Mrs. Funk said . " There is n't any . " She said she had worked with the Democratic National Committee and on national Liberty Loan committees of women , of which Mrs. was Chairman . Your work with the Liberty Loan committees faded right out into the work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Chairman Kenyon . I 've always talked for the Democratic Party , " Mrs. Funk replied . " And during this time on the Liberty Loan Committee , while you were speaking for the Democrats , your expenses were charged to ? the Government , were n't they ? " Chairman Kenyon pursued . All expenses of the speakers were paid on the Liberty Loan trips , " Mrs. Funk explained . Chairman Kenyon asked her if she was not talking about Mr. on all these trips . " We are trying to find out if this whole Liberty Loan organization was not turned over to Mr. , " the Chairman added . " We were trying to do our patriotic duty , " said Mrs. Funk . " Who pays your expenses traveling about on this work ? " asked the ChairMOM . " I 've only visited four or-five Democratic state conventions . " she said , " and I 've paid my own expenses . I 've written to all the delegates to the National Convention , myself , urging Mr. 's availability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to state the situation about Mr. clearly , " Mrs. Funk said . " I have been about the country and I find a ground swell of sentiment for him . I have talked with him about it for hours  --  from dinner until 2 o'clock in the morning and he ca n't be budged on the matter . He simply wo n't have an organization . You ca n't move him . He wo n't let us do a thing . He wo n't get into a. fight . He wants the delegates to go uninstructed and nominate the strongest man . " H. F. Sinclair , president of an oil company , testified that he had not contributed money to General Leonard Wood 's campaign , or the campaign of any other candidate . Norman Bridges , one of the officers of the Doheny Oil companies , said that he gave $1,000 to the Wood fund in May . Know of Mr. Edward- L. Doheny contributing ? " Senator Reed asked . " I know he had not up until one week ago , when he left New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no knowledge of other contributions .
