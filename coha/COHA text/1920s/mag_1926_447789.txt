Ir one goes with Mr. Garvin , Sir George Hunter , and others of the like atrabiliar complexion , one must conclude that Britain is sick almost to doomsday and that it befitteth the whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe . And , indeed , much has happened in the last twelvemonth to justify the densest gloom : still further depression of the greater industries and trades ? coal , iron , steel , cotton goods , shipping ; a strike of coal-miners averted only by the grant of a huge Government subvention to maintain wages at the existing level ; the loss of the tremendously important Chinese market through the boycott ; the vicious and cleverly managed Communist offensive , culminating in the Bolshevist resolutions of the Trades Union Congress at Scarborough ; increase of unemployment ; increase of the excess of imports over exports ( it may reach a total value of ? 450,000,000 for the year ) to the point that , some say , the gap is no longer bridged by the invisible ' exports and Britain is now living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doles ; much else in the like dismal sort . And here is a consideration to silence your facile optimist : the disease of the British coal industry appears to be mortal . British supremacy in worldtrade was based on coal . Coal has ceased to be the mainstay of that trade . British coal can not maintain the competition with American and German coal , because of its far greater cost at the pit mouth ; and this cost is due primarily , not to excessive wages , but to the difficulty of extraction , because of the depth and awkward conformation of the seams . Patience , ' counsels Premier Baldwin , ' patience. ; the world is recovering , and with that recovery the lost British markets will be regained . But is not that a fallacious hope ? In the competition for the revived markets will the odds favor Britain ? ' Now , listen ! ' as my Broadway girl would say . Important orders for construction of craft for British use have gone to Dutch and German shipyards ; seeming to indicate , not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare , but even that she can not maintain a successful defensive . Prior to the Great War , 80 per cent of the new marine shipping of the world was being turned out of British yards ; the percentage is now less than 50 , perhaps as low as 30 . And if British iron and steel are now losing ground visibly , month by month , what will be their plight when Lorraine iron and Ruhr coal are close allied , as they certainly will be ? By consequence from the war , the capacity of industrial production of several Continental nations has grown portentously ; not so of Britain . Victorian England was the workshop of Europe ; England is now only one of several workshops , and not the most efficient . Patience , forsooth , with such a face of things , and with an annual addition of over 200,000 mouths to be fed , the birth-rate holding its own , emigration declining ! The Empire will save us , you say ! But is it not , for example , labor lost and fatuous policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Colossus of the West , looming Djinn-like ? And is not India as good as lost ? And the struggle to make South Africa a White Man 's country utterly vain ? Macaulay 's famous passage about London Bridge haunts the memory . Dean Inge , take our ears ? a permanent loan ! But are there not hopeful arguments of virtue to grapple and throw such arguments of despair ? Yes , but only on a long view and on the precarious supposition that economic statesmanship of the first order shall dominate the scene . A clean sweep must be made of certain fallacies . It must be recognized that the Victorian supremacy of Britain in trade and industry is definitely of the past , and that ' there are others , ' with a wanion . On the other hand , it should not be held to follow that Britain must therefore fall into a decline . The Coal Age , so-called , is over . The Age of Oil , White Coal , and Electrification is here . But Britain has no oil in the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , it might seem . No ; for she has coal . So , then , we have boxed the compass , so to speak . What , above all , Britain needs to enable her industries to compete successfully in the world-field is cheap power . She can get it by reorganization and readaptation of her coal industry , and simultaneous general reorganization and reconstruction of industries and transport on the basis of electricity and oil . Low-temperature carbonization of coal gives three products : oil , gas , and a smokeless fuel ( the 70 per cent residue ) of calorific value equal to that of the best raw coal . Carbonize the coal at the pit mouth ; you get enough oil to satisfy all the needs of shipping and ' motor transport . ' Use what may be needed of the // gas and smokeless fuel for generating ( in proper centres at or near the coal fields ) electric energy for distribution at low cost to the manufacturing plants , railroads , and so forth ; and enough smokeless fuel ( solid or powdered ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miscellaneous necessities of power . As an instance of the saving by the process , it would utilize all the inferior coal ( 25 per cent of the whole ) , which now goes mostly to waste . The best expert opinion , I understand , endorses the above programme . With its realization Britain should compete in the world-field with restored confidence . Britain is anxiously awaiting the report of the Royal Commission on the Coal Mining Industry , to be rendered by next May . Presumably its recommendations will embody some such programme . But realization thereof would , you say , imply an industrial revolution . Precisely so ; but the alternative is disaster and decadence . Wherefore I observed that the situation calls for economic statesmanship of the first order , boldly to decide , gallantly to challenge the inevitable dangers , to cross the Rubicon . The July crisis in the coal-mining industry was the most important episode of 1925 in Britain , in the Empire , in the world . It brought home the absolute necessity of epochal , revolutionary decisions if Britain is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His subsidy was to ensure peace till May , to gain time for definite formulation of policy . Next May there will be another crisis , far more important ; out of it a fighting chance for Britain , or sure decline . I said ' a fighting chance ' ; but even that must be qualified . Under present conditions Britain is overpopulated by ten million souls . Realization of the programme above indicated , supplemented by a thorough scientific general programme of anti-waste , might provide well-being for the present population of the kingdom and the natural increase of a decade or two . But the point of saturation would soon be reached again . Obviously the increase should be steadily offset by emigration . The Empire Settlement Act of 1922 was a move in the right direction , but in the first two years of its operation it accomplished but a tenth part of its intention . It should be properly amended and made to work under the direction of some happy tactful genius . The Baldwin Government is quite aware of this , but will it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt with two matters of supreme importance to the British realm and the British Commonwealth of Nations . I may only glance at a third : namely , the tariff policy of the realm . Free Trade moderately tempered by camouflaged Protection is the present policy . Obviously Mr. Baldwin is at a stand . He probably thinks that under present circumstances a moderate policy of general protection ? adequate , at the least , to cover a considerable extension of operation of the principle of Imperial Preference ? would be the ticket . But where to draw the line ? Theoretically the Empire , no doubt , could be made economically self-sufficing ; but so to talk is nonsense . ' T is against the spirit of the age , which really tends to economic internationalism rather than economic nationalism or imperialism . The ideal policy should promote mutual helpfulness throughout the Empire , should strengthen intra-imperial ties , without prejudice to the foreign trade . Ah ! but what is the ideal policy ? Doubtless the pattern thereof , like that of Plato 's ideal Republic , is laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cobden and Joseph Chamberlain ; never to be known or realized on earth . 128 " finis RUNS THE WORLD AWAY ' But that spectre of German competition ; how to lay it ? It is said that German payments under the Dawes Plan in full flourish call for trebling of the German 1913 export surplus . Patience , ' counsels Premier Baldwin , ' patience . ' Can he be thinking of M. Loucheur 's International Economic Conference , for which the League is making preparation ? That conference , if you believe M. Loucheur , is to deal the coup de grace to economic nationalism , ' to establish an ' equilibrium between production and consumption , ' to effloresce into a United States of Europe ! Softly , my Muse ! These be wild and whirling words . I say flatly that the domestic record of the Baldwin Government has been creditable ; believing , as I do , that the policy of caution , of sawing wood , of watchfully waiting on developments , was , for the conditions , correct . Unemployment has increased , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not so as to overtake the normal increase of employables . The key industries have been desperately buffeted , but somehow the British pre-war proportion of world-trade is maintained ; world-trade being 20 per cent below pre-war proportions . The very latest returns are definitely reassuring . Baffled , one murmurs that bon mot so mystically true : ' There are lies , damned lies ? and statistics ! ' As for the Red Terror , ' t is but a bug to fear boys and yokels . In the imperial and foreign fields the record of the Baldwin Government has been brilliant . With the advent of Mr. Chamberlain to the Foreign Office , the high imperial style was resumed . The Russian Treaties , the ink of the signatures scarce dry , died the death ? unhousel 'd , disappointed , unaneled . The Egyptian affair was admirably handled . The murder of Sir Lee Stack hastened an inevitable crisis . Egypt had to be brought up with a round turn . The British reserved rights were propedy asserted and the Egyptians made to see that the provisional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered consummated until certain specified conditions have been fulfilled . Better yet , the British position in the Sudan is clarified . It is fairly apparent that the British protectorate of the Sudan will have the same term of life as the Empire ; a monstrous good thing for the Sudan ? and Egypt . The problem of India is too vast and vague for notice here . I think it may be positively stated that the position of the British Raj has been greatly eased ? one reason ( sinister , if you please ) being that , after a last desperate effort to save it , the preposterous accord between Hindus and Moslems has been fatally disrupted . No doubt important decisions have been taken respecting the experiment in self-government . Is the Dyarchy to be continued in a much revised form , or is the experiment to be carried forward by a different route ? For the experiment will go on . For the most part , the outlying members of the British Commonwealth of Nations have had a prosperous year . In only one of the self-governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South Africa . But she has rightly diagnosed her malady . For some time white emigration has exceeded white immigration . Why ? Because British white men and women , looking whither to migrate , repelled the lure of South Africa , misliking the thought that their descendants might be Negroids . The remedy is segregation of the blacks , which can be accomplished in a perfectly humane manner . After all , the blacks south of the Zambesi are of a migration almost as recent as that of the whites . Mention must be made of two // dangers ahead ; the danger of a blow-up in Ireland when the report of the commission delimiting the frontier between the Free State and Ulster is published , and the danger of a war over Mosul . It can not be doubted that the Baldwin Government will be true to Britain 's pledges to Irak . If Ghazi Mustapha Kemal is really boiling for a fight , apparently he can have one . But I doubt he is such an ass . I feel a certain II delicacy about the inclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the comparison with the rest of mankind , prosperous out of all cess , and brocade should not flaunt itself before rags . Our favorable balance of trade for the fiscal year 1925 was over a billion dollars , and we are putting out a billion yearly on foreign loan . While world-trade averages something like 20 per cent below the 1913 level , our foreign trade tops by 1.5 to 20 per cent our pre-war total . We have half the gold in the world . Our national wealth increased by 35 per cent in the decade ended in 1923 , totaling in that year about $321,000 , - 000,000 . Eighty-six persons in the United States paid taxes for 1923 on taxable incomes exceeding in each case one million dollars . Incomes , if you please ! Our national debt is fast being reduced , and the national budget has been cut nearly a half since 1920 . Though the 1924 reductions made the Federal taxes easily tolerable , we are assured a further easement by the new Congress . Great Britain and most of our smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt France and Italy will soon follow suit ; for they can not long continue to kick against the pricks . I would fain avoid this delicate subject , and will , but must make one observation . Our system of government is perhaps , on the whole , the most admirable in the world ; at least for us . But obviously it does not permit that generosity in the debt settlements which belike ( I am not sure ) the people might favor . At the Paris Conference in January we secured something more than our due share of the Dawes Plan annuities . We have no Red menace , no unemployment worth mentioning , no threats of war . We are in jolly good humor , as proved by our imperturbability respecting the inconvenience caused by the anthracite strike . We can spend eight billions annually without a flutter for automobiles and their maintenance ; and , since Britain puts up the price on rubber , we have $100,000,000 available for planting Liberia in rubber ( soil 0 . K. , climate not so bad , labor cheapest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll convert Central America , Mexico , the Philippines , and so forth , into rubber plantations , and run Britain out of the market . Put that in your pipe , Mr. Churchill , and report the flavor ! We 'll show you that it does n't pay to try to put anything over on the U. S. A. We need deny , and in fact do deny , ourselves nothing . There is a constant stream of galleons conveying to our shores the art treasures of Europe , which soon will see the last of the Old Masters . If bored little Betty cries for a dinosaur egg , she has it . Our annual bill for cosmetics exceeds imperial budgets . We are at the dawn of an immense development of commercial aviation . The chief result of the lamentable disaster to our first giant rigid dirigible ? the Shenandoah ? will be to stimulate experiment toward eliminating the weaknesses of that type . The best of arguments for moving forward boldly in the air is the magnificent success of the Air Mail Service . Mr. Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial aviation will develop lustily without Government subsidies provided that : ( a ) a bureau of civil aviation is established in the Department of Commerce for rendering services to commercial aviation analogous to those rendered by the Government to commercial navigation ; ( b ) a body of aviation law is enacted , corresponding to merchant-marine law ; ( c ) carriage of the mail is contracted out ; ( d ) ample air-ports are established at the important municipalities ( by the municipalities themselves ) . The prospect stirs the imagination . We are indeed prosperous ? whoopingly , almost terrifyingly prosperous . We are ? to put the thing in our direct and simple American way ? It . Yes , but the things cited are but the trappings and the suits of prosperity . There may be that within which is not so satisfactory . Despite our authentic triumphs in architecture , and that within a generation we have added three ( Whistler , Saint Gaudens , Sargent ) to the small choir of ' Old Masters , ' the fact remains that our characteristic art is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Publicity ? a religion whereof the rites are as hideous as those of Baal or Ashtoreth . The chief ceremony of that religion in the past year was the trial of Mr. Scopes . Our banditry record of the year puts China to shame . Obviously banditry in China is in its infancy . Our divorces are overtaking our marriages . Soon there will be more divorced than married adults in the U. S. A. In its final short session the Sixty-eighth Congress made little progress ; no doubt because the balance was held by the ' Progressives . ' Its most striking piece of legislation was that increasing the salaries of Members of Congress and Cabinet Members . No doubt the increases were proper , though the austere life may be commended to our representatives ; but the manner of carrying it was an offense to the national olfactories . That there was so little outcry upon the occasion was lamentable ; perhaps , after all , we were a little proud of our legislators for putting it over ' so deftly . The more important legislative proposals which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the Muscle Shoals Leasing bill ; sundry farm-relief bills ; amendment of the Transportation Act ( looking especially to promotion of railroad consolidation ) ; ratification of the Turkish treaty and the Isle of Pines treaty ; and the proposal of adhesion to the World Court . I expect consummation of the greater part of these proposals by the Sixty-ninth Congress . Already the new Senate , briefly meeting after the inauguration , has ratified the Isle of Pines treaty after a preposterous delay of twenty years , and it can hardly reject Admiral Bristol 's advice to ratify the Turkish treaty . The President neatly summed up as follows his conclusions upon the report of his commission of nine appointed to evolve a programme for the permanent stabilization of agriculture . ' Almost the entire difficulty of agriculture , ' says the President , ' is on the side of distribution . ' Adequate scientific legislation for the prombtion of the cooperative marketing of agricultural produce and live stock is expected of the Sixty-ninth Congress . There is to be a ferocious conflict in the next Senate session over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knife against old Filibuster . There are no dangers observable in the navigation ahead . We may confidently expect that A constant trade-wind will securely blow And gently lay us on the spicy shore . // ( b ) satisfactory arrangements respecting the domestic debt ; ( c ) funding of the debts to the United States and Britain on tolerable terms . To achieve these desiderata and avoid inflation ? hic labor , hoc opus erat . Herriot had gone far toward the achievement of ( a ) when his fall was precipitated by an extraordinary error of tactic which would have ruined the career of a man less transparently honest . He was succeeded , in April 1925 , by a Left Government under Painley &; with ( could such a quick reversal of fortune seem possible even in this our World Turned Upside Down ? ) Caillaux for Finance Minister . And it was scarcely less staggering that Briand should accept to serve , as . Foreign Minister , in a cabinet including Caillaux . Briand 's acceptance of the Foreign Portfolio did great credit to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representing with supreme address the majority sentiment of his nation , he perhaps contributed even more than did Chamberlain or Luther to the success of the negotiations recently consummated by the Locarno instruments . The selection of Caillaux startlingly illustrated the desperateness of the plight of the fisc . The French are the most experienced and on the whole the most civilized of peoples ; but their civility is after all a mere film . In their extremity they resorted to magic and summoned the ' wizard , ' Caillaux . And Caillaux was not found entirely wanting . He is , in the opinion of this writer , an absolutely unmoral egotist . But on this occasion his professional pride was piqued ; he was resolved to justify his reputation as an economic master . He acted as though he had ? and , belike , the strange man has ? a professional conscience . He was not , in my opinion , given a full chance . The Ghost of his Past stalked him , and one might almost say that 132 THUS RUNS THE WORLD AWAY ' Retributive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the 1925 budget was knocked galley-west by the unexpected Rif and Syrian wars . His conversion loan , which was expected to ease the pressure from maturing Government obligations , was a failure ( the Ghost , you see , terrifying the cautious ) . As to his failure at Washington , I know not what to say ; but I have a feeling that Fate dealt shrewdly with him at that supreme crisis . Our Debt Commission did not play the Shylock . The present value of the total payments contemplated under their last offer would be about $2,800 , - 000,000 . The total of the French debt is about $4,020,000,000 . The present value of the total payments contemplated under the last French offer would be about $1,750,000,000 . But it is doubtful that , even with our agreement to terms approximating the last Caillaux offer and like generous treatment from Britain , France could win through her present difficulties without dangerous dislocations , without terrible impairment of her social and economic fabric .. For consider these figures ( furnished by the National Institute of Economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own researches ) : The debt of the French Republic is the equivalent of about $22,000,000,000 ( eight billions deadweight foreign debt ) , as against our Federal debt of about twenty billions , all domestic . At present ? with negligible payments on the foreign debts ? the French people are paying at least 20 per cent of the national income in taxes , as against 18.5 per cent for the British people and 11.5 per cent for the people of the United States ; whereas the national income per capita in France is only $195 , as against $395 in Britain and $605 in the United States . Now , Messieurs Borah et al. , is your attitude quite the one indicated by humane considerations or ( but that is another story ) the enlightened self-interest of our nation ? I quite agree with the Institute of Politics that only by a major operation can France be saved from extreme misery and probably disaster of the first magnitude . The economic boom of late 1923-late 1925 was altogether deceptive , unwholesome and hectic . The reaction has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By his counsels , of a salutary brusqueness , he persuaded the patient of the necessity of the operation . The war with Abdul Krim has been a pure calamity to France . It aggravated the fiscal embarrassments ; it imperiled the superb achievement of Marshal Lyautey ; it even ( thanks , in part , to a considerable sentiment in France against colonial commitments , which took this occasion to assert itself ) endangered the entire position of France in Africa . Regretfully I omit detailed notice of the war , and merely remark that , unless political develop . ments should change the face of things , next spring should see the ' liquidation ' of Abdul Krim 's glorious effort . It remains , however , to see whether Marshal Lyautey 's work will securely survive his departure from the scene . He proved himself the equal of any colonial administrator of history ? Roman proconsul , British viceroy , Chinese Warden of the Marches in the great Han or T'ang days , name you whom you will . That was a stupid act of Herriot , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarrail . Against initial difficulties , the tact and sympathy of General Gouraud and General Weygand had given assurance of success to the French mandate . But , as Herriot must have // known , Sarrail , though a good general in the field , is perhaps the most tactless person in the world , as he showed at Saloniki during the war ; and tact is the quality most required in dealing with that kittle folk , the Syrians . The French ' manner of dealing ' with Damascus was , it would seem , a masterpiece of tactlessness and bad judgment . The French will have hard sledding henceforth with their Syrian mandate . Says the wise Confucius : If remoter people are not submissive , all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so ; and , when they have been so attracted , they must be made contented and tranquil . ' IV The Germans are eating more meat than they ate prior to the war , and the full alcoholic content of German beer has been restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by way of secondary proof , that the greater industries ? such as iron , steel , and coal ? have made tremendous gains ; that the shipping arrivals at Hamburg exceed by 25 per cent those of a year ago ; that the financial position continues sound ; that the budget shows a healthy surplus , revenue receipts very considerably exceeding expectations ; that the railways , as consolidated and reorganized under the Dawes Plan , show a splendid profit ; and that unemployment in mid-September totaled only 250,000 . There are pessimists who declare that the economic boom is artificial , and to be credited entirely to the very favorable first-year arrangements under the Dawes Plan , the payments of the first year being almost covered by the international loan ; that , as the burden of payments increases , black clouds will succeed that first Rose of Dawn . But , though Germany can not hope entirely to escape deflation pangs , her economic recovery is in fact guaranteed by the Allied and Associated Powers . The Dawes Plan provides for flexibility in its application , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to German recovery . Germany is definitely and securely on the economic up-curve . Viewed from another angle , the German comeback is still more remarkable . Germany is rid of the most vexatious servitudes imposed by the Versailles Treaty , and further riddance is assured unless the Nationalists ' gum the cards . ' Germany is far , very far on the road to recovery of her proper ( always assuming good faith and no return of militarism ) political position in the society of nations . She has sat as equal with the great Allies at the council table , and as an equal has initialed the Rhine Pact , one of the most august of human instruments . Of the Locarno instruments it is sufficient to remark that , when or if they are consummated , only by a super-equivocation at which the Father of Lies himself might baulk can a loophole of justification be alleged for aggressive war by Germany on France , Belgium , Poland , or Czechoslovakia ; or vice versa in each case . I think it quite likely that in the negotiations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cunning rather than generous motives , but I believe that in initialing the Locarno instruments Chancellor Luther fully shared in that spirit of Locarno ' felt and magnificently expressed by Briand . To be sure , the Locarno instruments have not been consummated by the required formal signatures and ratifications ; but there is every reason to expect that they will be , and with the happy incidental effect of emphatically reducing 134 ' THUS RUNS THE WORLD AWAY ' the Nationalist influence in German politics . Say , if you please , that the spirit of Locarno ' was but a momentary gleam , an illusion ? at the least the Rhine Pact safeguards France and Belgium ; for the British sense of honor is the least illusory thing in the world . Little comment is required on the year 's developments in German domestic politics . The December 1924 elections were in one sense reassuring , in another unsatisfactory . The Reichstag representation of the parties unequivocally loyal to the Weimar Constitution is considerably greater than it was in the old Reichstag and greater than the representation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little dubitatively , the People 's Party to be of that grouping ) ; on the other hand , that representation was not quite a majority ; so that it had to be either a Biirgerbloc Government , to include the Nationalists , or new elections , and after much manoeuvring the former was the choice . It may be said that on a flat show-down of Republic versus Monarchy the Communists would hold the balance ; but probably the Republic is safe . The election of Hindenburg was not really a Nationalist victory , but rather a remarkable tribute to that splendid warrior ; and , as it has turned out , a deserved one . The popular instinct discovered in him a man to be trusted ; and not only Germany , but the whole world , is much beholden to his great good sense and massive integrity . V The decision taken at last by Spain ( with what a wrench to pride ! ) to cooperate in Morocco with France , has probably ensured a settlement during the coming year of the problem of the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a boon indeed ! And then what , as to peninsu. lar Spain ? Primo de Rivera has organized a political party y-clept the ' Patriotic Union ' to which in due time is to be entrusted the task of carrying forward under ' a restored regime of constitutional normality ' the programme of the Military Directory . Some months ago the Marques took the people into his confidence and with charming ingenuousness admitted that the progress made to date was far from correspondent to his first hopes . But I incline to think that he understated his achievement . Despite the increased expense of the Moroccan War , lie has reduced the budget deficit by 40 per cent , and with the end of the Moroccan business the budget should be balanced ; the synchcalists and their brethren of like appeal have ceased from troubling ; there is little unemployment . The great achievement of the Directory , to my mind , is the Municipal Statute , which restores those Communal Councils anciently so rich in promise . This is to be followed by a Provincial Statute of analogous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme indicated by geography , history , and the manifest genius of the Spanish people . At the best , Catalonia will furnish a difficult problem for many years to come , but it is a problem certainly solvable by enlightened and patient statesmanship . The caciques have been run to cover . But still the programme is far , far from realization . Primo de Rivera is entirely vague as to the date of transfer of his task to the Patriotic Union . ' The road of purification stretches far ahead . ' There 's the rub . Sure provision must be made against return of the caciques . Now what does Primo de Rivera mean by a restored regime of constitutional normality ' ? Does he mean restoration of the old parliamentary system , or anything like it ? That system , a preposterous travesty of English parliamentarism , has been discredited , as a like travesty has been discredited in Italy . With restoration of that absurd system , the Augean stables which the Dictator has been at such pains to clean would soon be in a hideous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a function like that of the Fascist Party in Italy ? He has in the &m; aim ( a revival and nation-wide extension of a provincial organization ) an instrument not so unlike the Fascist militia . We shall watch developments in Spain with eager interest . The reported activity of the Communal Councils may be earnest of a Spanish renaissance , or it may be that the Spanish people are too sunk in torpor to thrill even to a Cid . VI An ancient Chinese poem begins thus in translation : ' At this low ebb , at this low ebb . ' That would have been consonant to the mood of Fascismo a year ago ; and joyous , lilting Giovinezza ' must then have rasped . The Matteotti murder had given an opening to the Opposition which they were quick to seize . They gave loud publicity , with suitable garnishment , to sundry acts of Fascist zeal untempered by decency , and the Fascists were reduced to the humiliating necessity of explanations , of admissions , of promises to purge out or effectively discipline intransigent elements which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumps , and the Duce himself fell desperately ill . But the Opposition went too far . The personal charges against Mussolini could not be made good . People reminded themselves of the Red Terror to which Fascismo had been the answer . The Fascists recovered confidence . Certain acts they wisely forbore to defend , instead repudiating the perpetrators ; others they assigned to the category of sacred violence . ' For it seems that when a Fascist knocks a Communist o ' the pate , the violence may be ' sacred ' ; but not so t ' other way around . On March 22 the sixth anniversary of Fascismo was celebrated with incredible enthusiasm throughout Italy . Addressing a vast concourse in Rome , Mussolini , recovered of his illness , shouted : ' This meeting marks for me and for you resumption of Fascist action against all our enemies . ' ( Pause , that spak sic things . ' ) Will you follow me ? ' Well , rather . And ever since Fascismo has been going it strong . In October , Fascismo definitely arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed certain resolutions which are to be presented to Parliament for enactment , and of course it may not be doubted that Parliament will enact them . They contemplate the political and economic reorganization of Italy very largely on an occupational basis ? an adaptation of Guild Socialism . Not less important , they provide for immense enhancement of the power of the Premier , who is to be vested with effective control of the new system of corporations and syndicates . A happy balance will be maintained between the power of the workers and the power of the employers , all disputes incapable of simple adjustment to be referred to Labor courts . It is of first significance that magistrates to preside over these courts are to be appointed by the Central Government and to be backed by the necessary force . The constitution of the Camera is not to be changed , but the Senate , much enlarged , is to be reorganized , four fifths of its members to be elected on an occupational basis , one fifth to be appointees of the King ; the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THUS RUNS THE WORLD AWAY ' declared contempt for shams , one may expect the Camera to be relegated to Lethe 's wharf in the near future . The proposals as drafted are rather foggy , but no doubt they will be given clarity and precision in the process of enactment . If a really genuine experiment in Guild Socialism adapted to modern conditions should be forthcoming , the world would be immensely indebted to Mussolini therefor ; but the magnitude of the powers proposed for the Premier provokes a certain dubiety . It is proper , however , to suspend judgment . On the whole , Fascismo has been justified of its works , and on the whole Mussolini 's Dictatorship has been beneficent . He has balanced the budget , improved trade , greatly reduced unemployment , immensely enhanced efficiency in all the services , and raised the international prestige of his country ; and now apparently he proposes to scrap the constitution . The Italian parliamentary system , like that of Spain , was a preposterous travesty of British parliamentarism , and it behooved to scrap it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a satisfactory substitute , approve himself a constructive statesman of the first order . Mussolini has told us repeatedly of late that Julius Cmsar is his model . He could choose no better one . May one be bold to suggest that an even closer imitation of that model would not be amiss ? There is for Dictators a great deal of importance in style , and the style of Mussolini increasingly mislikes me . Caesar did never threaten , nor boast , nor exult . He never posed . He had a proper sense of limitations ; he halted at the Rhine and the Thames . His most distinctive quality was a humorous equanimity . If one may presume to advise : Study your model , good Benito , and keep cool . VII Ghazi Mustapha . Kemal continues his salutary task of abolishment of shams and of consolidation of the New Turkey on a Nationalist basis .

The fez , to be sure , is preposterous ; but is it any more so than the sundry models proposed to us by Messieurs Dunlap and Knox ? And look you , Sir , do not the Turkish breeches afford more ample accommodation than do our unmentionables , for the Purse ? If you would assimilate Turkey to the West , remember , remember : The Purse is the Thing . In divorcing his wife , no doubt the Father of New Turkey had in mind to pay us the flattery of imitation and so win our Senate to ratification of the Turkish Treaty ; and to encourage in Turkey a practice which has contributed so much of wholesome and picturesque to our social life . The inevitable reaction in Turkey was nipped i ' the bud with the suppression of the Kurdish insurrection and the pendulous illaqueation ' of its leaders . VIII It is quite out of the question to explain in a paragraph or two the developments of the past year in China . One should not forget that China ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same area and the same population as Europe exclusive of Russia ; that she is now undergoing a transformation , social , economic , and political , the most stupendous and profound yet seen in the world ; that our sources of information are meagre , and the more important processes are obscured . // The growth of Chinese Nationalism is one of the most important phenomena of recent times . It arose out of resentment of the utterly selfish and damnable encroachments by the Powers . It developed a determination to recover all that had been lost by those encroachments . After its first blind and ferocious expression , in the Boxer uprising , it was until recently chargeable with very little antiforeign violence . The major credit for that astonishing increase of Nationalism belongs to Young China ' ? that is , the considerable and ever-growing body of Chinese who have received some tincture of education along Western lines . The majority , including the best , of the leaders of Young China have not countenanced antiforeign violence . They have hoped to recover Chinese rights by the Confucian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the boycott , that Chinese invention . But always there was the danger that the extremist leaders , the intransigents of the Left wing of the Kuo MM-tang or Radical Party , would seize some opportunity to provoke a violent and vicious explosion of antiforeign feeling . Those gentry found an opportunity in the industrial disputes of the midyear in the foreign-owned mills . Observe , however , that gradually , except for Canton , ? which is differentiated from the rest of China much as Barcelona is differentiated from the rest of Spain , ? the more sensible and Confucian-minded leaders regained the ascendant . But the wave of Nationalist feeling is still at height . ' Unhand me , ' says China ; and the Powers , however reluctantly and ungraciously , are proceeding to comply . It were , perhaps , better for China , as well as for the Powers , that the process of restoration of the sovereign rights filched from her should be gradual ; but , if developments have made it necessary to speed up the process , the Powers have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and humiliations inflicted on her , resentment so just and so deep , may not be trifled with . The politico-military situation of China is of the usual fantasticality . There are three grand groups of Tuchuns : the group which backs the Provisional Peking Government , whereof Chang Tso-lin , that hard-shelled old Tory and ex-bandit , is chief ; the group headed by Feng Yu-hsiang , the ' Christian General ' and traitor ; and the group of Yangtse Tuchuns headed by Wu Pei-fu , who has come back ' strong . Feng is playing around with Moscow , while Chang is regarded by Japan with benevolent eye . I think Japan is sincerely desirous to keep out of Chinese complications , but she will not allow her position in Manchuria to be compromised and surely would not permit open intervention by Russia in China . As for Wu Pei-fu , I consider him China 's best hope , quite probably a genuine disinterested patriot . Almost anything of weird or fantastic might develop out of that triangle . I am an optimist concerning China , but only on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
