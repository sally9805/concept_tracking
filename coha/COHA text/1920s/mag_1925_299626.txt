Each year as the earth completes its circuit around the sun a group of Manhattan bankers , mighty gods of finance , assemble for the annual dinner of Group Eight of the New York State Bankers . <P> Number 27 of these dinners was held during the past week . The guest of honor was George Fisher Baker , Chairman of the Board of the First National Bank , doyen of U. S. bankers , hale and hearty , just on the short side of his 85th birthday and the 61st anniversary of his Wall Street career . <P> Present were John P. Morgan , Andrew W. Mellon and many another . Rarely does Banker Morgan speak in public , put on this special occasion he was eager to do honor to Mr. Baker . <P> Excerpts from Mr. Morgan 's eulogium : <P> Father . " For a great part of my father 's life he and Mr. Baker were close friends and associates in many matters . Father 's experience with Mr. Baker was that of all of us , an experience of unfailing friendship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I well remember , after the panic of 1907 , when my father was telling me the story of those anxious and agitated days , during which I had been absent , that he said , by way of summing up what he had been telling me : <P> " ' Of course , you see , it could not have been done without Mr. Baker ; he is always ready to do his part-and more . ' " <P> Helper . " And when , after my father 's death and just before the war , very heavy responsibilities were thrown on me and there were many puzzling questions to be dealt with , not my father himself could have been kinder or more considerately helpful than was Mr. Baker . But here I am touching on too intimate personal feelings , and will pass on . " <P> Profession . " Considering business as a profession , where will you find a better professor to teach that profession than Mr. Baker ? <P> " In the first place , he knows more about it , from experience over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has besides , to a degree unique in my experience , that invaluable quality of vitality , of youthful-mindedness , which enables him , while still keeping to the old fundamental principles with which he started his business life , and which he has carried all through it , to appreciate and make good use of the changes of method which are necessary in business , as in any other profession .
