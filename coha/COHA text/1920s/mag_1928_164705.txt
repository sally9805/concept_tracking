Five thousand Pekingese troops supposedly adherent to the new Nationalist State mutinied at Chefoo , last week , trounced troops which remained loyal , and raised the five-barred flag of the old Peking Regime which has just surrendered to the Nationalists ( TIME , June 4 , 18 ) . Since the loyal armies of Nationalism number not less than 400,000 men , the mutineers at Chefoo appeared to have indulged in a bit of sheer midsummer madness .
