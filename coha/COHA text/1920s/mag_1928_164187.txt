BAMBI-A Life in the Woods-Felix Salten-Simon and Schuster ( $2.50 ) . Painful in the extreme are animals that talk . Among long-standing exceptions are Aesop 's menagerie with their impressive wit , and Br'er Rabbit with his ingenuity . Boasting no such qualifications , Bambi , straightforward story of animal life , is nevertheless another worthy exception . And though the story will also be read to children , the Book-of-the-Month Club has offered it to its subscribers , adults . For aside from interesting data on wild animals ( which , not being the very wild animals of Safari , will not be of general interest ) Bambi has dramatic impulse and charming philosophy . <P> Dramatic in the life of Bambi is his first passionate fight , antler-locked with a rival buck , for Faline , sleek and lovely mate . Dramatic is the first fleeting encounter with his father , aristocrat of animals . And not till he has proved himself worthy of his father 's company does the old stag lead Bambi to a solitary haunt , and teach him the necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground , forces Bambi to realize that man is not all-powerful , as fawns and silly does suppose , but that there must be a higher power over all .
