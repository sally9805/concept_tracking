Seldom does Mr. Walter Duranty , able Moscow correspondent of the New York Times , indulge himself in any but the most decorous nouns and adjectives . Last week a suppressed flair for a style more incarnadine and virile apparently overcame him . He filed a long despatch , which ran in part as follows : <P> " Under the iron rule of the proletarian dictatorship freedom still exists in Russia . Right here in Moscow , despite Red guards and secret police , freedom runs rampant , wild as wolves and as savage-a freedom anarchistic-free to rob , free to fight , free to kill , free ( as needs often must ) to starve . <P> " It is the freedom of Moscow 's homeless children , thousands of them , parentless , homeless . . . . highwaymen , murderers and dope fiends almost before their bones have hardened . They have gnome-like , filthy faces , childish eyes , shaggy hair , long men 's coats , trousers pinned up or cut and ragged . They shuffle together , taking counsel , then swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopman 's counter , grabbing anything , running like the wind . <P> " I followed several of them as they fled along a street . In a courtyard they were dividing their booty . One had bread , one a herring , one a packet of cigarets , one chocolate , one nothing . But all was put in the centre and divided equally . Then they began eating hungrily . <P> " I asked them where they lived . They eyed me like small animals waiting to spring but not daring . . . . A small blue-eyed girl wearing a fragment of an army overcoat over a jute sack cut short above her thin bare legs , said amiably : <P> We know where we live , but if you tell the gendarmes about us we will find you and cut your heart out . ' <P> " So I withdrew , discomfited. "
