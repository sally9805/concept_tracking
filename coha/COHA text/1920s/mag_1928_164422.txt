Militant conspirators chose a dark hour just before dawn last week to attack the regime of picturesque President General Juan Vincente Gomez , famed 70-year-old Dictator of Venezuela . <P> As dawn neared , a battalion of Federal troops quartered near the Presidential palace in Caracas mutinied under the leadership of Chief-Conspirator Captain Rafael Alvarado . Two brother officers who would not join the mutiny were shot dead . Then , having tasted blood , the battalion rushed out at double quick march to seize the large supplies of arms always kept at the San Carlos Barracks . <P> By a quirk of fate , the commander of the barracks , General Eleazar Lopez Contreras , had slept poorly and was up at an unusually early hour . . . . In the nick of time , just before the revolted battalion rushed up , General Contreras succeeded in organizing a defense to the barracks . Bullets spotted for two hours . . . . The Gomez men won . <P> So definitive seemed the victory that President Gomez relaxed the usual rigid Venezuelan press censorship and permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his conduct last month in suppressing for days all news of demonstrations by students who marched through Caracas shouting , " Down with the tyrant Gomez . " <P> Rival Venezuelans , having submitted to Gomez for 20 years , now seem to want a change . Their decision to submit or to revolt is important to U. S. business because Venezuela has become in recent years the second largest oil producing country in the world-the U. S. being first .
