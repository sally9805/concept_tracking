Last week Manhattanites buzzed about a booming market , bustled for baseball tickets , queued up before movie palaces , applauded Smith on the Vitaphone . <P> Few noted a staid though flag-bedecked building on East 41st Street . Of what importance could it be ? Where were crowds , vociferous fanfare ? Yet inside were 140 Englishmen , 200 Americans carefully explaining what they had scientifically done for industry . They made up the Society of Chemical Industry . Their meeting was the first held in the U. S. since the War . <P> Eternal cycle . Among those whose minds were groping for the heart of being rather than its stomach was Robert Andrews Millikan , Nobel Prize winner , student of the cosmic ray ( TIME , Nov. 23 , 1925 ) , + physicist of the California Institute of Technology . For years he has been in the vanguard of those attacking the foundations of the universe . <P> The occasion of Dr. Millikan 's address was the award made to him of the Messel Medal , an award bestowed by the society every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducive to the progress of science . <P> Dr. Millikan explained that there was no reason apparent why the universe should ever end , implied that it had never even begun . Somewhere in the depths of space , he believed , helium , oxygen , silicon and iron were being formed from the ultimate constituent of all matter , the electron . " In the hot stars and the sun , " he said , " matter is being disintegrated into energy or radiation : in the unimaginably cold expanse of space , radiation or energy is being reintegrated into matter . " <P> This reintegration evinced itself in the cosmic rays , which he described as the " birth-cries " of the atoms , radiations pouring in upon the earth from infinite space by night as well as by day , a fact excluding solar explanations , emanation capable of penetrating eighteen feet of lead , a far greater depth than any other known rays . <P> Cows . Dr. Millikan 's abstractions were the exception , not the rule . Other reports dealt with some of these practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , president of the society , reported experiments indicating that the stock-carrying capacity of pastures and consequently their output of meat or milk may be increased to an unexpectedly high level . One-half an acre of grass intensively treated with nitrates for the purpose suffices as a substitute for the usual two or three acres required to graze a cow or its equivalent for a season . <P> Glass . A. E. Marshall , consulting engineer of the Corning Glass Works , pointed out the possibility of glass pavements for city streets , glass roofs for houses , glass furniture , glass plumbing . <P> Lilacs . Lilacs bloom for Christmas when Dr. Frank Earl Denny , research director of the Boyce Thompson Institute at Yonkers wishes it . Likewise two crops of potatoes grow for him where only one obliges the efforts of another . Nature has given plants a dormancy period which is the plague of horticulturists . Dr. Denny found that exposure to the vapors of ethylene chlorhydrin and ethylene dichloride waked plants up immediately . <P> Gas . Dr. Benjamin Talbott Brooks said that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foresee that petroleum would be diverted from its main purpose of driving automobiles.
