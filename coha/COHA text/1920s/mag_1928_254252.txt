SIR ROBERT PEEL-A . A. W. Ramsay- Dodd , Mead ( $5 ) . <P> " ' No man who in life was so hated and reviled was ever so lamented and honored at his death . ' " Hated in life for his stern unfriendliness , reviled for advocating measures that his party did not support , Sir Robert Peel was honored at death for sacrificing popular favor and party goodwill to the welfare of the nation . That welfare he fostered by an impressive array of reforms-most of them in the face of impassioned opposition : Catholic Emancipation in Ireland ; establishment of constabulary forces-the London Bobbie ( or Peeler ) by tradition is nicknamed in his honor ; wise factory legislation ; reorganization of taxation , currency , criminal law ; development of a new liberal Conservative party out of the reactionary Tories ; and finally , drastic Free Trade measures which initiated the vast expansion of British trade . <P> Time and again he had the courage to change his mind and defy his party-notably in the cases of Catholic Emancipation and Free Trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed interests ) he had opposed Free Trade , opposition to which was exemplified in the famous Corn Laws . But with the changing needs of a country fast deserting agrarianism for industrialism , Peel reconsidered . Suddenly in the summer of 1846 the crops failed , famine threatened . Peel declared for a Whig measure-repeal of the corn tariff-thus precipitating one of the bitterest battles of British politics . With devastating sarcasm , scintillating wit , and considerable treachery , Disraeli immortally flayed his chief as " a great parliamentary middleman . . . who bamboozles one party and plunders the other , " and reviled him for having caught the Whigs bathing and stolen their clothes . <P> In Miss Ramsay 's hands a prosaic Corn Law becomes a matter of fiery drama , and the most eventful period of British parliamentary history becomes the most exciting ; Her lucid analysis of the political situation sets the stage , her vivid incidental sketches of " Dis , " Lord Pam , Victoria , people it . Impartial , she creates Peel with all his faults of temper , tactlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all his grandeur as England 's greatest Premier .
