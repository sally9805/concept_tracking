txt Compromise has once more been Invoked in the matter of increasing the permanent membership of the Council of the League of Nations . The French proposal for the admission of at least one permanent member as a " counterpoise " to Germany ' has been put aside for the time being . Germany will take her seat next month . In the Autumn Spain will he installed as permanent member , with Poland as one of the six temporary members . British opinion , which has been greatly exercised over the question , has been right in part and wrong in part . It is obvious that the occasion was seized by consistent critics of French policy to put themselves on record . From far-off South Africa wild and whirling words have been pronounced by General Smers , whose course since the Armistice has been difficult to chart . Supposedly one of the outstanding leaders of " liberal " at the Peace Conference , his name is nevertheless bound up with the huge assessment of Germany 's reparation debt , which was the most mischievous feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hand Alsace-Lorraine back to Germany . That sort of " public opinion ' ' need not be taken too seriously . Greater weight attaches to the argument developed by men like Viscount GREY . Adoption of the French plan would mean repudiation of the terms upon which Germany agreed to enter the League . More than the specific iotation of the understanding with Germany would be the spirit of distrust encouraged by setting up the principle of a " counterpoise " to Germany in the Council . If Germany 's presence in the League is to have real value , for Mc peace of Europe , Germany must be accepted as a League member to work with and not to keep a suspicious eye upon . No doubt her ' presence in the League will bring into that body the element of debate and clash . But the Allies , as well as Germany , have obviously made up their minds that it is better for all concerned to thresh out their problems inside the League than with Germany on the doorstep . To raise a suspicion of a - Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undo much of the good work accomplished since Locarno . Actually , of course , there can be no ? packing of the Council of the League . On vital matters every member of the Council is sufficiently protected by RS own absolute veto . Nor is there an assurance that any " alignment " which may be set up in the Council will be permanent . Today France advocates Spain as a counter-check to Germany . But the friendship between Paris and Madrid is only of recent standing . Spain 's neutrality during the war did not greatly please the French people . There Is no certainty that a few years front now Spain may not be voting with Germany against France . For several years after the war Italy was regarded in France as openly pro-German . But Italy today , on the question of a union between Germany and Austria , is more French than the French Government . On both sides of the debate there has been altogether too much stress laid on the question of alignments In the Council of tht League .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
