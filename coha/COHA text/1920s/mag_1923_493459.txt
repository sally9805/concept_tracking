Revising the Taxes SECRETARY MELLON 'S letter proposing a reduction of $323,000,000 in taxes is so straightforward and full of so much common sense that it upsets completely the devious plans of our politicians . The taxpayer looks at the finance minister 's revised schedule and sees that his income taxes are cut practically in half . This holds whether his income be four thousand dollars , ten thousand , or ten million . A protest against such a program dies as a gurgle in one 's throat without ever coming to vocal utterance . In the year which ended on June ' 30 , 1923 , the federal government had ordinary receipts of $4 , - 007,000,000 . Its ordinary expenditures were $3 , - 295,000,000 . This left a surplus of $712,000 , . - 000 . With this surplus Secretary Mellon paid $614,000,000 of debts , and added $98,000,000 to the balance in the general fund of the Treasury . These are figures which any one can understand , and they speak well for Mr. Mellon 's administration . During the twelye months which ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable . The ordinary receipts of the government amounted to $4,102,000,000 , and the disbursements to $3,250,000,000 . Out of the surplus of $852,000,000 the Treasury cancelled $686,000,000 of debts and added $166,000,000 to the net balance in the Treasury . During the present calendar year the collections of the Treasury will amount to almost exactly $4,100,000,000 . Of this amount $3,400,000,000 will come from customs duties and taxes , as follows : The remaining seven hundred million comes from miscellaneous receipts . Almost two hundred andfifty million of it will come from payments of principal and interest by foreign governments . More than seventy-five million will come from the sale of surplus property ; and about one hundred million from estate taxes , or inheritance taxes , as they are popularly termed . Of the income taxes collected this year , about eight hundred million will be paid by corporations and one billion by individuals . The receipts from every class of taxes enumerated above have been higher so far this fiscal year than they were in the corresponding period a year ago . If the present schedule of taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the calendar year 1924 would be at least $3,600,000,000 , and might well run several hundred million more than this . This , together with the miscellaneous receipts , would bring total receipts to $4,300,000,000 . If the present tendency to reduce expenditures were continued , it would be possible to reduce the national debt by more than a billion dollars next year . But Secretary Mellon knows that a revenue surplus of more than a billion dollars will not be allowed to go for debt cancellation . The desire of members of Congress to throw the ex-soldiers a political sop in the form of a bonus would call for an appropriation bill adequate to wipe out the surplus and more too . Secretary Mellon evidently believes that the Republican party has more to gain by avoiding the disastrous experience of 1892 than by distributing bonus lollypops at this time . For surely any bonus that has as yet been proposed , or any that is at all likely to be provided by Con- , gress , can be considered as nothing more than a sop to the men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insult for those of us who remained at home to pretend that we are discharging our obligations to these men by paying them a few hundred dollars . From the standpoint of broad financial statesmanship , Secretary Mellon 's proposal to reduce the surplus by lowering taxes is a sound one . If Congress could be trusted to leave the surplus to be applied to the cancellation of our public debt , that would probably be the more desirable course . Our revenues are abundant and we are bearing the burden without great hardship . It would have been well , if the political situation had permitted , to apply a billion dollars or more to the cancellation of our debt during this period of prosperity . The specific proposals for the reduction of taxes do not excite the same full measure of enthusiasm and admiration which Secretary Mellon 's courage and political sense command . The taxes on telegrams , telephones and leased wires , on admissions and miscellaneous commodities , should as he says certainly be repealed . They were devised in the summer of 1918 , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these taxes was quite as much to discourage people from buying things which were not absolutely necessary or whose purchase could be postponed , as it was to raise revenue . The tax was intended as a reminder that the money being spent should have been put into Liberty Bonds or war savings stamps . Such taxes have been so productive , however , that they have been retained until this time . The tax on telegraph and telephone messages is particularly anomalous . The telegraph and the long distance telephone are means of communication , just as is the postal service , and compete with that service to some degree . The deficit of the Post Office Department last year amounted to almost thirty million dollars . The tax collected from those who use the telegraph and the long distance telephone is almost exactly equal to that deficit . The government is , therefore , collecting from those who use one means of communication a tax sufficient to cover the deficit which it incurs in rendering a competitive service . This is an utterly ridiculous and indefensible procedure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons that Mr. Mellon 's proposal exhibits undue solicitude for corporate profits and other recipients of large incomes . Beginning with 1922 the corporations were relieved of the excess profits tax , which had amounted to $1,180,000,000 per annum on the average , during the five years 1917 to 1921 inclusive . Corporations will pay no excess profits tax on the large earnings they are enjoying in 1923 . These earnings will amount to not far from eight billion dollars , and would , under the rates prevailing in 1920 , have brought the government one billion dollars in excess profits taxes . The surtaxes were reduced for incomes earned in 1922 from a maximum of sixty-five percent to fifty percent . A further reduction to forty percent would appear to most people as liberal treatment . Secretary Mellon 's argument for the reduction of surtaxes is that the high rates on large incomes defeat the very end for which these rates are levied . The Treasury figures show that the number of persons reporting large incomes to the Treasury for tax purposes has declined steadily since 1916 , as has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the year 1919 , when both the amount of income reported by persons with $300,000 and over and the surtax paid by them were larger than in the previous year ; and indeed larger than they had ever been in any year . In 192o and 1921 the number reporting incomes of this size declined seriously , as did the amount of income reported and the surtax paid . From this the Treasury concludes that the taxpayers have reduced their taxable income by " withdrawing their capital from productive business and investing it instead in tax exempt securities and adopting other lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income . " This is an old argument and the Treasury has used it repeatedly until the press of the country has come to accept it as true . But the facts cited in Secretary Mellon 's letter do not bear out the argument . The table on page six of that letter shows the decline in net income and the decline in dividend and interest received by persons who reported over $300,000 of net income . Anyone who compares these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1919 and 1921 , will discover that dividends and interest received in these respective years declined less than did income from other sources . It is evident , therefore , that the surtax has not driven people out of industrial investment . The whole statistical presentation to support this contention that the high surtaxes have driven people to tax exempt securities is utterly inadequate in this letter , as it has been in every previous attempt of the Treasury to establish that proposition . If Secretary Mellon wants to discover the exact extent to which the qualitative nature of the incomes of rich people has changed he can do so by bringing the analysis of the 1,240 incomes published in the 1919 statistics down to date . The Statistics of Income for 1921 , published only a month ago , shows the kinds of property which went to make up the estates of 12,203 people whose estates were filed during the year 1922 . These decedents owned property amounting to $2,879,000,000 . Of this property only $103,000,000 consisted of wholly tax exempt bonds ; and $117,000,000 of partially tax exempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estates of these persons was invested in tax exempt securities . There were ten persons who had estates of ten million dollars or over , whose total property amounted to $292,000,000 . They held bonds which were wholly tax exempt amounting to $18 , - 000,000 , and bonds partially tax exempt amount- ing $6,300,000 . The total of their exempt bonds was , therefore , less than eight and one half , percent of their gross estate . Capital stock of corporations formed forty-seven percent of their estates . What we need here is the same kind of straightforwardness in the analysis which characterizes the remainder of Secretary Mellon 's letter . The public would like the facts in this matter . So far it has not had any which are adequate for the formulation of an intelligent judgment . The remarks in this letter which imply that the high surtax rates have destroyed individual initiative and enterprise and have led taxpayers to withdraw their capital from productive business must be taken with a grain of salt at the high tide of prosperity which has characterized the year 1923 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the encouragement which the changes will give to productive business " will soon replace the revenues which are lost by the reduction of rates . Our personal income taxes fell in 1921 because it was a year of serious depression . They will be high in 1923 because it is a year of industrial activity and large profits . Quite naturally the letter omits all discussion of the excess profits tax . The Secretary of the Treasury may avoid that discussion , but surely Congress will not , if the question of tax revision is opened at all . The facts made available through the administration of the excess profits tax from 1917 to 1921 have revived the discussion of taxes upon differentials . No one can examine the statistics of corporate profits during those five years without realizing how widely profits in industry vary from establishment to establishment and from industry to industry within the same year . The old argument that the excess profits tax raises prices has been shown to be fallacious on logical grounds ; and the course of prices within the last three years makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to bring the prices of the things the farmer buys more nearly into balance with the things which he sells , let them make a sweeping reduction in the tariff ; and replace the revenues thus lost by a simple excess profits tax of twenty-five percent on profits in excess of eight percent on invested capital . That would be a real stroke of financial statesmanship.
