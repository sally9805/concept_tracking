ROME HAUL-Walter D. Edmonds-Little , Brown ( $2.50 ) . <P> Short hauls to Rome , N. Y. , long hauls to Albany , the oldtime " canawlers " of the Erie Canal made with boatloads of machinery and produce . It was a leisurely existence , drifting along four miles an hour behind stout teams that trudged the towpath . For a few months Dan'l Harrow , farmer , was a part of it . Clever with horses , he hired on as driver to a canal captain and then fell heir to the boat . For " cook , " meaning servant , companion , and **30;6461;TOOLONG , he hired vivacious Molly ; for driver he hired Fortune Friendly , variously parson and pinochle player . Dan first saw Fortune racing from a village with the entire population thundering hotfooted in his wake . Cornered in a barn , Fortune delivered , gasping , a hell-and-damnation sermon which left not a member of his congregation unchastised . Afterward he explained to Dan'l that he had contracted to give six sermons , but finding only five at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sheer terror inspired the extemporaneous barnyard Jeremiad . <P> On his preaching proceeds , Fortune played pinochle with fat and red-haired Mrs. Lucy Gurget . Dressed in a red flannel petticoat , yellow blouse and beribboned bonnet with improbable cherries that rattled to her constant laughter , Mrs. Gurget " cooked " for Mr. Solomon Tinkle , basked on the deck of his boat . <P> Rome Haul is well peopled , but it is rather the story of a canal , and the history of a vivid phase in the development of U.S. civilization . Burdened with no plot or proof , it is engrossing for its otherworld , yet essentially new-world , atmosphere .
