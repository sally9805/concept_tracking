While gendarmes and French soldiery scoured the Riviera for spawn of Communism cast out by Italy ( who must , said Frenchmen , have been the dastards that bombed Legion trains last fortnight ) , Retiring Commander Howard Paul Savage and some 200 American Legionaries specially picked for their ability to commerce in goodwill , entered the cavernous railroad station at Genoa . <P> Commander Savage made a speech : " We are very happy to be here . We bring the salutations of the American Legion to the Italian Army and nation , past and present . We are greatly pleased with our reception , but not surprised , since we are in the native country of the man who discovered America . " <P> Signor Sanselli , national director of the Italian Veterans ' Association , spoke in kind , but did not go so far back in history as to recall the original Legionaries from Rome , who used to march through what is now Genoa on their way to subdue the barbaric Gauls , Angles , Saxons , Celts and Teutons from whom U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of his men and their wives wanted to see Genoa harbor . Admiral Cayni commandeered five tugs and showed his lively guests about . <P> Legionaries who stayed ashore in Genoa commented up the reserve , the dignity , the almost disdain of Fascist Italy . How it contrasted with demonstrative France ! But soon " buddies " were saluting camerati ; soon they were imitating the Fascist salute ( right arm forward , raised at 45 , palm open downward ) and solemnly saluting one another with it . <P> So many bands played so many national anthems that many a " buddy " said his back was tired from standing at attention . <P> All within a few hours , the good-will men were lunched by King Vittorio Emanuele and blessed by Pope Pius XI . Commander Savage later described how " King Emmanuel of Italy welcomed us in his summer palace at Pisa . " " He is , " said the Commander , " the most affable , democratic monarch it would be possible to meet . His speaking such perfect English made things especially easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King finished talking with a knot of Legionaries and turned to leave them , a U. S. voice boomed : " Gangway for the King ! " <P> The Papal reception followed the laying of a wreath of dahlias on the grave of Italy 's Unknown Soldier , and parading to " The Star Spangled Banner , " " Piave " and " Giovinezza . " Ascending the snowy marble steps of the Apostolic Palace , the Legionaries , all dressed in their evening clothes , were met by smiling Swiss Guards whom Vatican etiquette forbade to salute . The Pope came forth in white . The Legionaries knelt . Commander Savage and a few others were presented . The Pope examined the Legion flag , made a speech : <P> " . . . Our heart is particularly gladdened because you have come so far to kneel at the feet of the head of the great Christian Church . " <P> The Pope passed among the Legionaries , letting each kiss his ring . Upon the head of blind Frank Schobel of Philadelphia he laid his hands and said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what you have done and for what you have suffered . We are sure He will give you strength to undergo deprivation , also rewarding you . "
