( See front cover ) <P> Time fled , and still the G. O. P. knew not whom it would choose to oppose the settled choice of the Democracy next November . The uncertainty was greater than ever following Secretary Mellon 's declaration last week that " many men may develop in the convention , for you never know what will happen " ( TIME , May 21 ) . <P> Candidate Hoover , the Administration 's busy but not supremely happy Beaver Man , waded into a trout-stream in Pennsylvania and for three days indulged pensively in the Sport of Presidents . He used the subtle , sporting fly , however , instead of the homely , almost infallible worm . <P> Candidate Lowden , the determined Farmers ' Friend , returned to Chicago after visiting Washington and Manhattan , and indulged in the sport of candidates . He enunciated an Issue . He paced the floor of his office , shook his silvery poll , pounded his desk , even smote listening newsgatherers on thigh and chest to publish his point . <P> In Manhattan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do anything to create bad blood . " But in Chicago he was excited and emotional over what he said was the East 's shocking disregard of Farm Relief . The McNary-Haugen farm bill , containing the " equalization fee , " talisman of the Lowden campaign , lay on President Coolidge 's desk awaiting a probable veto . Mr. Lowden intensified the political significance of the bill by shouting : <P> " I do not want the nomination unless the Republican party meets the farm issue fairly and squarely ! . . . I have no hankering for the kind of fame that rests on an unsuccessful Presidential campaign ! . . . Agriculture realized the moral and economical wrong of Slavery and joining with Business it created the Republican party . I feel that there is again a crisis and unless this partnership Agriculture &; Business is maintained now , the candidate named at Kansas City will have a hard road to travel ! " <P> Some observers thought that this statement actually raised an Issue-the first <P> Issue of the campaign in either party-and that it fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention . Others viewed it as only a temporary resurgence of an undercurrent which can be diffused in the convention and submerged afterwards. * No one suggested that it bettered Candidate Lowden 's chance of being nominated but all were agreed that it threatened Candidate Hoover . <P> There are three factions in the Republican party : Hooverism , anti-Hooverism and the Administration . Of these , Hooverism is the most popular , as demonstrated by the primary elections . The Administration is the most potent , by virtue of its record and occupancy . Anti-Hooverism is miscellaneous but its chief hero is Candidate Lowden , because he has a definite program for a large , definite group of voters . That this program is more important than personal success to Candidate Lowden is not doubted , except by such cynics as could read " sour grapes " between the lines of his conditional renunciation last week .
