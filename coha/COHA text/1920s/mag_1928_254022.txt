Two articulate dogs last week argued for attention . At the Eastern Dog Club 's show in Boston one Princess Jacqueline , French bull from Bangor , Maine , answered questions logically , in a thin , high-pitched voice like a parrot 's , " I will . . . I wo n't . . . Bangor . . . elevator . " Her owner , Mrs. Mabel A. Robinson , explained proudly that Jacqueline had learned to talk " all by herself . " <P> In Manhattan , Mrs. J. Stuart Tompkins read of Jacqueline , was piqued into bragging of Boulderwall , her Great Dane house dog . Never permitted to bark , Boulderwall 's lips have learned to fashion sounds to the pattern of human speech . Intelligent , she answers simple questions in a voice that is clear , and high-pitched . <P> In the case of both these talkative bitches the words are , of course , only modified whines.
