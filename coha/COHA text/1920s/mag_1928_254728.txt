One swallow does not make a summer . One plane does not make an airforce . Nevertheless , the approval of the U. S. State Department , given last week , to the purchase by Mexico of a Ford-Stout all-metal monoplane like the one in which Mrs. Lindbergh , Engineer William B. Stout &; Mrs. Stout &; friends flew from Detroit to Mexico City , was welcomed in Mexico and discussed in Washington as the harbinger of a general lifting by the State Department of the embargo on U. S. planes sold to Mexico . In approving purchase of the single plane , which the Mexican government said it wanted for official inspection tours , the State Department said it would review the whole plane and arms &; ammunition embargoes.
