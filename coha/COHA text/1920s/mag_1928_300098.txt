A machine designed to hurt the ears of several hundred people at a time was grimly experimented with last week , by Prime Minister Otto Braun of Prussia . <P> Though Prime Minister Braun is a humanitarian and a Socialist , he has grown tired and angry at the conduct of Communist and Monarchist deputies who constantly obstruct proceedings of the Prussian Diet by their catcalls and hoots ( TIME , Oct. 25 , 1926 ) . <P> Last week the machine for hurting ears was installed in the Diet building and a dozen hired mendicants were brought in to test the apparatus by being hurt . <P> At the click of a switch super-power " scream amplifiers " came into action , and words conversationally spoken into a microphone on the desk of the President of the Diet resounded through the hall like deafening thunder peals . <P> Several participants in the test rushed from their seats in acute distress , and 24 hours later two of those who fled reported that their ears still rang , pained .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
