txt It was CHARLES DICKENS who ( according to a well-known practitioner of the amenities of book collecting ) made Christmas Day a universal holiday . And he did it by a little book , " the greatest little book in the world " it has been called , " A Christmas Carol , " published just eighty years ago . The original copy rests in Mr. MORGAN 'S book " shrine , " here in the midst of New York City ; but its cheer has penetrated into nearly every land under the sun , as the cheer of the last stanza of the carol drove away the fog and frost that hung about the black gateway of old Scrooge , the misanthrope , the night before Christmas . And there is still enough cheer left in that story to warm every heart in this vast city , whatever its degree of hardness , cynicism or disappointment may be . The church took over the day into its sacred almanac from other calendars in which the day or season was celebrated as the birthday of the unconquered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday of the " SOrt , of GOD . " But without losing its sacred character ( and it is this year celebrated for the first time by all the churches of Christendom , since the Eastern Orthodox Church has adopted the Gregorian calendar. ) , it has spread the tidings of thai ( - good- will which is and will ever be . ask3cated with the birthnight in Bethleilenr ( despite all disputations concerningjhe virgin birth ) into every household ? ' whether Jew or Gentile , Protestant or Catholic , whether with or without one of the faiths that found their cradle in what is , to many of differing creeds , a Christian , Jewish , Moslem holy land . The pervasion of this community and of every community in this country and every community in many countries by the Christmas spirit at this season makes it the nearest to a universal holiday that the world knows , and the fact that a day of this import is more widely observed than any other is perhaps the best ground for hope that the world will be a better world as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booklover quoted above , sags of the " Carol " might be said of the Christmas observance which it immortally describes : " It makes " every one want to make the World a " little better ; * * and when every " one wants to do a thing they usually " do it . " We have but to extend that observance through the year and follow , as old Scrooge , the counsels of the partner of our better nature in us , make mankind our business , make the common welfare our business , make charity , mercy , forbearance , benevolence our business  --  a business in the comprehensive ocean of which the dealings of our trade are but as a drop of water  --  we have but to do this internationally as many try to do it individually or by communities or even by States in order to achieve through good-will toward men generally that which was wrought fin the crabbed isolationist , old Scrooge , ' B'vernight .. ?                @ @ @ @ @
