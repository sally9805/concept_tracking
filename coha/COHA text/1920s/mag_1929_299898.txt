Seldom if ever is their work stopped by any Ministry of Fine Arts . <P> Last week the French Ministry of Fine Arts ordered all construction stopped on the Boulevard St. Michel extension of the Paris Metro .

Unimaginative French laborers who crawled in to look about with smoky acetylene torches , quickly crawled back , actively sick with horror .
