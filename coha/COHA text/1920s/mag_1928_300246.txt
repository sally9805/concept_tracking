Homecoming . If you were told that this picture tells of the return of two soldiers , one married and one unmarried , and how the unmarried one gets home first and goes up the winding stairs to the door which the wife of the other opens for him , you would think of " Enoch Arden " or foresee at least the old pattern of passion , quarrel , and reconciliation . And since all stories are old stories , the pattern you foresaw is here , but since some never become familiar you would hardly foresee the patient , particular realism which makes this German " Enoch Arden " into living , modern truth , or guess the force of the emotion shaping the layers of incident to an ending stripped of grandiloquence . Struggling to get out of Siberia , the two comrades ( there are only three people in the cast ) thirst in a desert composed obviously of flour , shavings , and papier-mch ; their thirst , however , is real , their momentary , flaring hatreds , their gestures toward heroism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are real , surviving buoyantly the inadequacies of mechanics . Director Joe May , Actor Lars Hanson , maintain the fact , recently put to question by shoddy productions , that Hollywood may have bought most of the talent of the UFA company but has not yet bought all the brains . Dita Parlo 13 the girl to whom the soldiers return ; she has both brains and beauty . <P> Gang War. * No gangster taking part in the crime-wave of the cinema has undergone a more amazing reformation than the one who , holding the rose his sweetheart has given him , is mowed down by pistol bullets while rescuing her innocent lover from the rival gang . Yet in spite of its frail conclusion and the inevitable echoes of the shots which , fired in the play Broadway , were heard round the world , this picture begins with a good idea : two reporters go to a dance-hall hostess who has the dope about the innocent boy 's love affair with a little cabaret girl ( Olive Borden ) .

Best shot : New Year 's day in San Francisco 's Chinatown . <P> <P> *No connection with the Willard Mack " legit " - drama of the same name .
