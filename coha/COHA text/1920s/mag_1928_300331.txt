The Laughing Cavalier is a sports roadster . King Henry VIII and The Blue Boy are all-weather phaetons . The Ceiling of the Sis tine Chapel is an inside drive sedan . <P> No gibberish are the above statements . <P> They are easily explained by the fact that Cadillac-La Salle engineers together with Fisher and Fleetwood coachworkers have built 17 automobiles with color schemes derived from paintings by 17 famed artists , from Botticelli to John Singer Sargent . The purpose was to use precisely the colors of the paintings ; to give each color its proper value ; to distribute the colors so that the result would be practical , utilitarian . <P> The Cadillac-La Salle-Fisher-Fleetwood clientele have always been gourmets of the gasoline world . But these latest models require the very pink of passengerhood . Only the jolliest , most debonair of present-day gallants could fittingly adorn the La Salle-Fisher Laughing Cavalier . Students of the Hals painting have provided it with hood and cowl of Wissahickon green ; lower body , fenders and gear of deep maroon ; wire wheels , rear deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear quarters of tan Burbank silk mohair ; mouldings of gold leaf . <P> Regally imperious must be the wife who would venture forth with the Cadillac-Fleetwood King Henry VIII , sumptuously decorated in wine , red and silver after the Holbein portrait . <P> For the personage with truly ecclesiastical majesty is the Cadillac-Fleetwood Ceiling of the Sistine Chapel , Michael Angelical in dull reds , blues , greens , gold . <P> Innumerable duets will find a luminescent cosiness in the La Salle-Fisher special convertible town car , glistening with greens , pale yellows and silver after The Conversation by Watteau . <P> And for the lady of devastating chic and ophidian fascination , who looks forward to penthouses rather than backward at palazzos , is the Cadillac-Fleetwood Art Moderne , a sleek transformable cabriolet in aluminum , black , copper , snakewood . <P> The cars were on exhibition at the New York Salon .
