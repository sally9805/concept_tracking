As it must to all nations , a Government came to Germany . After week upon week of crisis ( TIME , Oct. 13 et seq. ) , a way out of the intricate difficulty was found by Herr Hans Luther , so-called nonpartisan , Minister of Finance in the Marx Cabinet , former Mayor of Essen . He did something which no other leader in Germany has been able to do in the last four months-he formed a cabinet : <P> Chancellor-DR . HANS LUTHER , Non-Partisan . <P> Minister of Foreign Affairs-DR . GUSTAV STRESEMANN , German People 's Party . <P> Minister of Interior MARTIN SCHIELE , Nationalist . <P> Minister of Labor - HEINRICH BRAUNS , Centrist . <P> Minister of Economics-DR . KARL NEUHAUS , Nationalist . <P> Minister of Food-COUNT VON KANITZ , Nationalist . <P> Minister of Justice and Occupied Districts-FRENKEN . <P> Minister of Defense-OTTO GESSLER , Democrat . <P> Minister of Posts and Telegraphs- HERR STINGL , Bavarian People 's Party . <P> Minister of Finance-COUNT VON SCHLIEBEN , Nationalist . <P> Minister of Traffic - FRIEDRICH KROHN , Non-Partisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and constitutes a great victory for the Monarchists and Dr. Gustav Stresemann , leader of the German People 's Party , who has consistently championed their undoubted claims to representation in the Cabinet . <P> The parliamentary position of the Government , however , is exceedingly weak . It can rely upon permanent support of 216 votes against 176 votes of the hostile Opposition . Between the two , however , come the Catholic and Democratic Parties with 101 votes . These last two Parties decided to give the Government only temporary support and to retain their freedom of action in case the policy of the Chancellor warrants it . Their passage to the Opposition would therefore be a fatal blow to the Government . <P> After the Cabinet had been found , somebody asked Chancellor Luther what he was going to do . Replied he , somewhat worn out by his exhausting effort to form a Ministry : " If I had the nerve I 'd buy a ticket for Italy ! "                  @ @ @
