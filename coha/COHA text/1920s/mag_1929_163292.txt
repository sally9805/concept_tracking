Prizefighter Gene Tunney a year ago flew in a Sikorsky Amphibian the 150 miles from Speculator , N. Y. , to New York City . To insure his life for $300,000 and the plane for $30,000 during the single , short trip , his insurance company charged a premium of $1,000 . Another company might have charged more , another less . No one knows what is a fair rate for aviation insurance risks . Whatever standards exist are constantly fluctuating and depend on a multitude of conditions and contingencies . To help the insurance companies fix standards the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics last week instituted a thoroughgoing survey of aviation mortality . <P> Aviation insurance includes , besides personal accident and life risks , risks against planes , cargoes , airports , public liability , passengers , employes , fires , windstorms , thefts . The usual life or accident policy generally forbids flying .

McGee &; Co. , Associated Aviation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last March it groups 13 fire and marine insurance companies and three casualty companies , whose aggregate assets were then $330,000,000 . <P> First person to take out a special air policy was Horatio Barber . In 1912 he went to Lloyd 's in London to insure himself against liability to passengers who might travel in a fleet of five planes which he owned . Lloyd 's knew nothing of the risks , told him to write out his own policy , being just to them and himself . That led to an affiliation with Lloyd 's which , after the War , distracted him from flying . Now , 54 , he is in Manhattan , president of Barber &; Baldwin , Inc. , underwriting affiliates with Aero Underwriters Corp . <P> How unsettled are aviation insurance rates , two offers last week indicated . Both were for damages to houses caused by planes . American Insurance Co. of Newark , N. J. , figured that $1.56 a year was sufficient premium for $2,500 insurance . Continental Insurance Co. of New York figured $3 the yearly premium for $2,500 insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for property between one and five miles from airports , $2 for properties farther away .
