Bibles may be imported into the U. S. without payment of customs duties . Other books are taxed at the rate of 15% . In 1924 Lincoln MacVeagh , president of the Dial Press , brought one copy of the Apocrypha of the Nonesuch Bible to the U. S. from England and was taxed thereon 15% . Saying that the books of the Apocrypha were parts of the Bible , Mr. MacVeagh sued the U. S. to get back his money . <P> Last week the court refused to give this to Mr. MacVeagh . The reasons for the refusal were based upon the nature of the Apocrypha , or lost books , of the Bible . Certain of these , incorporated into the Old Testament by errant Hebrews and written down in the Greek Septuagint which is otherwise merely a translation of the Hebrew Old Testament , were included by St. Jerome in his Latin Vulgate . Theologians in the middle ages questioned the authenticity of the Apocrypha which St. Jerome had accepted . The Council of Trent ( 1545-63 ) established their repute , since which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic Bible , and in all translations of the Vulgate , such as the Douai or the Rheims Versions . <P> Protestants , however , soon cut the Apocrypha out of their Bibles , retaining only one little bit , the " Song of the Three Children , " in the prayer book of sects which have prayer books . Recently , a U. S. court admitted tax-free a cargo of Douai Bibles . These , however , included the Apocryphal book which Mr. MacVeagh had imported separately . The court 's ruling made it clear that for legal purposes the Apocrypha is part of the Bible only when it is bound with the other universally recognized books .
