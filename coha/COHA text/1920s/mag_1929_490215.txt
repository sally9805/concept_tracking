ROVER WHALEN is the name of the square-jawed , black-mustached face that swarms over the scenes of the period like the cupids in the old religious paintings . It used to be thought that the face was a bit of heraldry like the great seal of the Empire State , but it is taken from life . The recently issued Who 's TV ho in ilmerica places the original on an historical basis . It finds that he was horn in 1886 ( in a brick tenement house owned by his father at 275 East Broadway ) ; that his middle name is AIoysiiis ; that he was educated in military science at Clason Point Academy , in commerce at the Westchester School of Commerce , and in law at the New York School of Law ; that he became secretary to Mayor Hylan , etc. , etc . Two of the false impressions about Grover Whalen arc that he has led an easy life , ferrying queens and backstroke swimmers up the bay , and that any braided cutaway and gardenia , regardless of wearer , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just the contrary . The office of doorman of the Western Hemisphere is extremely difficult and exacting . Nobody else has filled it satisfactorily . On the third of last August , for instance , the mayor 's committee tried to hold a welcome without him . Bent on greeting the Brescia soccer team arriving from Rome on the S. S. Duilio , they went down the hay on the municipal welcoming ship Macnirt , colors all fluttering and street cleaners ' band doing itself justice . ' f hey tooted at the Duilio and mega-phoned that they wanted to take off the Italian athletes . The master of the Duilio trained a glass on the Macom . He saw no Grover Whalen , and holding that there was nothing in the law of nations which required him to stop for anybody else , he kept right on and nearly cut the 11.1acom in two . When the mayor 's committee tried to welcome the Graf Zeppelin without Mr. Whalen , marines struck at the committeemen 's heads with short clubs . Chicago , Boston , Philadelphia , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some of the receptions . In the case of Whalen , as in the case of Chaplin and other true artists , to appreciate the original it is necessary to see the imita tions . The Boston man committed the folly of wearing a high hat and frock coat at the Ruth Eider welcome , whereas , not having got beyond the Azores , she rated only a soft hat and double-breasted blue-serge suit . The Chicago welcomer mortified the North American Continent by wearing pigskin gloves for a Swedish prince , while the Philadelphian was guilty of every possible crime against port decorum , doffing his hat to the wrong tune , blowing kisses when the circumstances called only for a slight wave of the hand , smirking when he should have looked solemn , and bowing from the diaphragm when he should have bowed from the hips . The State Department does not have to go about repairing international relations after Grover Whalen . He never disturbed the peace of nations by ignorance of etiquette . W riALEta rose in the world on his etiquette , carrying John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small ash-trucking business , while John ran a lower court and an elocution school in Brooklyn . When John was nominated for mayor , Grover had his Business Men 's League indorse him , and they went through the campaign arm in arm . Hylan was somewhat shy and self-conscious . He had risen from the people and still retained some of their mannerisms , but Grover had deportment enough for six . He , with his Clason Point military bearing , would drive through a crowd , his chin pointing thirty degrees higher than the regulations actually require , as he towed his candidate along in his wake . He crusaded against the badger haircut and the neck shave . Before the campaign was over Hylan was polished till he glistened . Grover made only one failure  --  he was unable to communicate to Hylan any feeling for spats . Grover headed the secret Hylan steering committee . The cam paign headquarters were used for show , while all momentous matters were settled elsewhere by a small group over which Grover presided . The candid ate 's speeches iii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open on the table when those speeches were being assembled . They were Lincoln 's " Letters and Speeches , " " The Orations of Demosthenes , " and the " Editorials of Arthur Brisbane . " Grover may have inherited his instinct for politics , as his father was prominent in Tammany for many years . Irish on one side , French-Canadian on the other , his ancestry may explain many of his remarkable qualities . HYLAN was elected ; Whalen be- came his secretary . Before the year was over , however , the Mayor began to feel that his secretary was relieving him of too much responsibility , and Grover was suddenly booted upstairs into the position of Commissioner of Plant and Structures , but the men remained bosom friends for six years . They went to Palm Beach together . Grover could get practically anything he wanted from Mayor Hy-Ian except the heads of some of his fellow commissioners . He lauded Hylan as the greatest statesman since Lincoln . Yet there was always a vague misunderstanding between the two men . They held decidedly different opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Hylan . Plant and Structures is normally an obscure and uninteresting department , but tinder the able and aggressive 1VhaIen the office achieved vast importance . Seizing a scrapped street-railway line on Staten Island , reorganizing the ferries , and filling all boroughs with bus lines , he made himself the municipal Harriman . Moreover , he would have made his motley traction system pay , if it had not been for the necessity of buying power . He became , too , a newspaper publisher , issuing a tabloid called The Buzz of the Busy Bus . An insatiable craving for work and for responsibility drove him to assume more and more offices . He became chairman of the city 's Board of Pur-chases . He raided other city departments . From the Police Commis-sioner he stole the whiskey-testing laboratory which had been established to obtain evidence under the Mullen-Gage Act ; he made the municipal radio station one of the Hylan enter-prises ; he staged the city 's silver-jubilee celebration , opening it with a radio oration which has not been allowed to perish . Passages of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its striking thoughts is the following : " This city , I say , stands not by itself , aloof , but with its tow- ering canyon of buildings reach-ing to the sky . " One of Com- missioner Whal- en 's great indoor fCtes was a Christ- mas party , in 1923 , in celebra- tion of Mayor Hylan 's recovery from an illness . Grover forged ahead until he had the whole welcoming business in his hands . Editing the guest list at the city 's par-ties to queens and princes , he became an international Ward McAllister . Tacitly recognized as the chief com-missioner , he marched in the municipal parades twenty paces ahead of the others and only about a yard behind and to the right of Mayor Hyman . A tremendous worker himself , Commissioner Whalen got work out of his people . He sus- pended six stenogra-phers once for leaving the office five minutes before closing- time on a dull day . He was usually at one or another of his offices up to 8 P.M. , and frequently until midnight . Always cheerful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legion of friends . ONE vehement attack was made on him . Samuel Untermyer announced at one of his inquiries that he had discovered that Whalen 's old trucking firm , instead of dumping its ashes down the bay , as the law requires , had dumped them in the courthouse site and whatever other public property was handiest . Further than that , the eminent counsellor found to his horror that the ashes had " set " and that it would cost half a million dollars to extricate them . Placed on the witness stand , Grover said that he did not know a thing about this , because he had given away his half-interest in the trucking firm to his partner . Asked for the record of the dissolution of the partnership , the Commissioner said there was n't any . He testified that , happening to meet his partner on the street one day , he said , " Here , George , you take my half-int e rest ; " his partner said , " Thank you , Grover , " and that was all there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he regarded as an unsportsmanlike way of depriving him of a scandal . Commissioner Whalen has no talent for repartee , but he has earned a draw in most of his verbal encounters . He can make himself understood . When a former judge of the Court of Appeals tried to get subtle with him at a transit hearing , Grover called the distinguished jurist a dirty liar and a little rat . At Board of Estimate meetings , Comptroller Craig used to nag him a good deal , and several hundred times in the course of six years Commissioner Whalen came back at him quick as a flash with : " What the Comptroller says is of no consequence . " Comptroller Craig had his revenge by knifing Whalen 's pet project : a fifty-milliondollar bridge across the East River from Brooklyn to the doors of a friendly department store . M elements of bigness in his odd AYOR HYLAN , who had certain makeup , took a personal pride in watching Whalen grow . He regarded Grover as a Hylan by-product . He encouraged the young man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it very specifically , for he said , " I want all my commissioners to make such records that they will all be eligible for mayor . " John did not , however , wish them to be mayor until he was through being mayor , and he stuck for eight years and tried for four years more . Whalen tried to boom him for the governorship , the United States Senate , and the White House , but Hylan did nothing but freeze to his seat in the City Hall . Mischief-makers began to call Whalen " the brains of the administration , " till Hylan grew a little wary of his super-commissioner . One day he intimated to the late Rodman Wanarnaker that Grover Whalen would make an admirable executive for a department store . " But I would n't want to take him away from you , " said Mr. WanamakCr . " Never mind me , " said Mayor Hylan . S 0 " this remarkable man , " as his authorized biography puts it , entered " the roads of commerce . " The salary was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family to consider , could not reject . Mr. Whalen had married Anne Dolores Kelly in 1913 , and they have three children , Mary E. , Grover A. , and Esther Anne . After joining Wanamaker 's , he moved to art apartment house at 43 Fifth Avenue . In the Illaalen home is a remarkable gallery of autographed photographs and thank-you letters from hundreds of the most famous people of the time . Less than a year after leaving the Hylan administration , Whalen began to wear a Walker button , and on Walker 's election , he was again appointed to receive the distinguished guests . After Hylan had made an angry Comment on " traitors , " Whalen evened matters up by not inviting his old chief to the city 's dinner to Lindbergh . Mr. Whalen threw himself into mercandle life with characteristic dash . Overnight he developed a delicate judgment in oriental rugs and the furniture of twenty-three periods . Just at this time he also became business manager of the Byrd transatlantic expedition of which Rodman Wanamaker was the chief backer . His new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying cross-fertilized each other with singular results . The gloomy interior of the Byrd hangar blossomed out with chintz curtains , Chippendale furniture , art lamps , and turkey-red runners . THE thing that has made Grover Whalen a household word in the chancelleries and royal palaces of Europe , however , is his welcomes . The technique and symbolism of these events are his own . One of the ' halen touches , for instance , is that of having the municipal fireboats shoot aloft seven or eight streams , as the guest rides up the bay . Those scrolls , which surprise distinguished foreigners with astonishing facts about themselves , were also unknown in pre-Whalen times . The Whalen welcomes are always perfectly managed and thWilpingly successful . He has produced vast throngs for some of the world 's obscurest potentates . Making the discovery that no man could proceed up Broadway at noon without finding the sidewalks packed , he took advantage of this ready-made mob of unconscious welcomers . The visitor is always brought to shore at twelve sharp . Many an honest foreigner 's eyes fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway , as he observes the vast throngs which have turned out in honor of lunch . This device has been of great service because all of his guests have not been drawing cards like Lindbergh , Gertrude Ederle , and Queen Marie . It must be remembered that his welcomes have also been extended to a list of lesser celebrities which includes General Horatio Vasquez of San Domingo , Louis Borno of Haiti , Hassan Tagi Lader of Persia , the Lord Mayor of York , Prince Chichibu of Japan , Prince Potenziana Spada of Rome , Emir Ikahib of Syria , and George Kojac , the Ukrainian-American onehundred-metre backstroke champion . AST September Mr. Whalen pub-lished a statement of the cost of his welcomes under the Walker ad-ministration . The Lindbergh bill was $71,850.87 . The Byrd damage was $26,000 . Levine was a bargain at $1,079 , and Ruth Elder a positive economy at $333.90 . The most efficient work of the committee was the reception of twenty thousand Elks for $107.50 , or less than a cent an Elk . Comptroller Berry paid the charge for scrolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . The prices of scrolls fluctuated oddly . The Lindbergh one cost nine hundred dollars , or approximately three dollars a word , with no extra charge for the grammatical sentences . The Levine scroll was a sacrifice at four hundred dollars . An explanatory note intimated that the city would get the money spent on welcomes back with interest through increased prestige and business . NOW Grover Whalen has traded his **27;319;TOOLONG salary fora ten-thousand dollar one and accepted the police commissionership which Roosevelt used as a stepping-stone en route to the NAThite House . The police will find that they have a driving executive . He will get the work nut of them , and the smartest of his subordinates will have difficulty in fooling him more than once . Let the other commissioners look to their jurisdictions . Less than twenty-four hours after he was sworn in , he had seized the rights on a hig Fifth Avenue fire , thrusting the Fire Commissioner out of the picture . He will probably succeed as Police Commissioner . But whether he does or not , it is confidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street Cleaning Department , and all other city departments distinguished administrations .
