U. S. Commissioner of Education John James Tigert , 46 , handed last week his resignation to Secretary of the Interior Roy O. West and announced that he had accepted the presidency of the University of Florida . <P> He was one of the few appointees of President Harding who had stood the test of time . Born in Tennessee , he was the first citizen of that state to win a Rhodes scholarship . At 27 , as president of Kentucky Wesleyan College , he selected chairs for greybeards . In Florida , he will manipulate a university , adequately supported by the state , including schools as diversified as journalism and pharmacy . He is young enough to mingle with undergraduates , old enough to be a stubborn organizer .
