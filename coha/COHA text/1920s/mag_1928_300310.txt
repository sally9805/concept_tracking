Most people suppose that the American Red Cross never turns a deaf ear to the appeals of famished , stricken sufferers . When reports were first current ( TIME , Feb. 6 et seq. ) that 12,000,000 Chinese seem likely to die of famine before next Spring , most citizens of the U. S. confidently left the whole ghastly and appalling problem to the Red Cross . If they thought about it at all , they saw in their minds ' eye long lines of Chinafolk , gratefully receiving huge bowls of steaming soup from white clad , starry-eyed young Red Cross nurses . Rude therefore was the shock received by many contributors to the American Red Cross last week , when that organization 's executive head , Judge John Barton Payne , made clear that the American Red Cross had withdrawn from relief work in China . <P> No starry eyes , starch , soup-but millions of empty , pangful Chinese stomachs . <P> In 1920-21 the American Red Cross spent $1,214,000 on relief in China . Since then civil wars have been incessant-until the recent proclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Judge Payne , the various revolutionary commanders have seized for their own military use entirely too much of the food and money sent to China by the Red Cross and other charities . Therefore it has seemed best to let the thousands of culpable Chinese revolutionary soldiers-and incidentally the millions of innocent Chinese citizens-starve . <P> Few will deny that the policy of the Red Cross was justified , up to the end of the Civil War . But now that all China except Manchuria is nominally at peace and consolidated under the Nationalist State ( TIME , Oct. 29 ) it is news that the Red Cross is still holding aloof . Correspondents received from Judge Payne , last week , the strong impression that he is acting upon advice from the State Department . The Chinese Nationalist Government has been formally recognized by the State Department ( TIME , Aug. 6 ) . <P> The China Famine Relief Fund Inc. of Manhattan is now the only major U. S. organization collecting and distributing funds to fill 12,000,000 Chinese tummies which grow daily emptier . Originally the C. F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than $1 for each hungry Chinese . Some months ago General James G. Harbord , President of the Radio Corporation of America , resigned as Chairman of the Fund-which has now collected a scant $300,000 . Last week General Harbord 's successor , the Rev. Dr. S. Parkes Cadman , President of the Federal Council of Churches was laboring with but indifferent success to recognize the China Famine Relief Fund Inc. and collect the still lacking $9,700,000 . Thousands and almost certainly millions of the Chinafolk now starving in Shantung will die before anything can be done .
