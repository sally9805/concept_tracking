" Not for self-exploitation nor for profit but as a gesture of international friendliness , " there sailed from Manhattan last week on the S.S. Leviathan the sixty members of the Dayton ( Ohio ) Westminster Choir , for a two-month European tour beginning with seven concerts in England , going then to France , Germany , Austria , Czechoslovakia , Hungary and back through southern Germany , Switzerland and France . <P> Choir Conductor . Dayton , Ohio , as everyone knows , hears the first clang of more newborn cash registers than any other city in the world . Many persons have still to be informed , however , that Dayton hears also the best choral music sung today in the U.S. , for which credit is due John Finley Williamson , a conductor who knew what he wanted , and Mrs. Harry Elstner Talbott , a wealthy Daytonian who believed in him . <P> What Conductor Williamson wanted was better church music . He wanted to recreate an interest in the art of hymnology . Music , he said , was once the child of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest had their training . It should be brought back and made worshipful , the professional tang taken out . It should be devotion itself and delivered always with the greatest artistry . <P> John Williamson , quiet son of a clergy man , took his first job in Dayton as teacher of public speech and church music in the Central Reformed Theological Seminary . Soon he was engaged in choral work and for two years he directed simultaneously the music of seven churches . Then in 1920 he founded the Dayton West minster Choir , first made up of factory men and women , but later , because workers could not give the time to satisfy the Williamson ideal , of people who , like himself , wished to devote their lives to church and choral music . Today the choir of the Westminster Presbyterian Church is preeminently a choral school where more than 100 men and women from 30 states have gathered for the three-year course that fits them to be choral conductors . <P> The senior students have gone out as members of the touring choir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have learned more than the art of group singing . The Williamson course includes ear-training , conducting , hymnology , English , harmony , musical theory , history of music , Bible and church music literature . Five school days a week begin at 7:30 A. M. In addition there is field work , the organizing and conducting of graded choirs ; then a tour ( thus the personnel of the first choir changes each year ) ; then church positions to be administered in the Williamson way . Already more than 100 churches have requisitioned Dayton Choir graduates , at handsome salaries .
