Secretary of State Henry Lewis Stimson last week showed the perfectly normal reaction of a U. S. statesman who has been called " unfriendly . " He insisted that he was friendly , that he had acted from the friendliest possible motives in reminding Russia and China by identic notes of their obligation as signatories of the Kellogg Pact not to fight . The retort of Moscow 's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maxim Maximovich Litvinov that the U. S. note was an unfriendly act seemed to cause Statesman Stimson only pain . His soft answer was to make no direct reply at all and to observe to correspondents : " Between co-signatories of the Pact , it can never be rightly thought unfriendly that one nation call to the attention of another its obligations or the dangers to peace which may from time to time arise . . . . In the language of the joint statement issued by the President of the U. S. and the Prime Minister of Great Britain on Oct. 10 last , ' both our governments resolve to accept the peace pact not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive obligation to direct national policy in accordance with its pledge . ' " <P> Sympathizers regretted that the Pact had backfired at Mr. Stimson 's first major attempt to operate it , applauded his courage in proceeding on the assumption that a positive character has been given to a perfectly negative document by the verbal resolution of President Hoover and Prime Minister MacDonald . <P> Landing in Manhattan from the Leviathan , last week , Pact Man Frank Billings Kellogg said : " Undoubtedly the Pact is working . It is so considered in Europe , I know . Secretary Stimson 's action was entirely timely and proper . "
