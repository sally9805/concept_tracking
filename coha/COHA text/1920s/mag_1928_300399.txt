What Wall Street delicately terms a " combination of interests , " what on other thoroughfares would more bluntly be called a merger , last week transpired between the International Acceptance Bank and the Bank of the Manhattan Co. , both of Manhattan . The distinction between interest combination and merger lies in the fact that the two banks will not merge physical properties , but that their stockholders will arrange an interchange of securities . Later there will be formed an investment bank , to be known as International Manhattan Co. , so that , like many another bank , the new combination will have an affiliated financing organization whose operations and earnings may be less conservative than those of the parent body . Resources of the two banks total some $500,000,000 . <P> The union of Bank of the Manhattan Co. with International Acceptance brings together one of the oldest of U. S. banking families and one of the oldest of international banking families . The U. S. family is Baker , contemporary Baker being J. Stewart , president of the Bank of the Manhattan Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Warburg , current Warburgs being Brothers Paul &; Felix . The present story , however , concerns only Brother Paul , Board Chairman of International Acceptance , Associate Chairman of Bank of the Manhattan Co. , and his son , James P. , who will become president of International Manhattan . Of the two families the Warburg is the older , the more exclusively banking , the more internationally famed . <P> <P> The Warburg family derives its name from Warburg , a town in Westphalia , where Warburgs lived as long ago as 1400 . At some time during the Sixteenth Century the family moved to Hamburg . Here , in 1798 , was founded M. M. Warburg &; Co . Since the founding of the Warburg firm-130 years ago-a son of the Warburg family has always headed the House of Warburg ; no person not a Warburg has ever reached a dominant position . Comparatively , the Morgans are parvenus . <P> It is with the U. S. branch of the Warburg family , however , that the U. S. financial world is most concerned . For it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1921 . Born in Hamburg in 1868 , Paul M. Warburg entered a Hamburg export house at 18 , entered the House of Warburg at 20 . Followed experience in English , in French banking houses , a world tour , a return to Hamburg , and , in 1896 , membership in the Warburg firm . In 1894 Mr. Warburg had married Nina , daughter of Solomon Loeb of Kuhn , Loeb &; Co . In 1902 he came to live in the U. S. , became partner in Kuhn-Loeb , in which Brother Felix had been a partner since 1896.
