txt Man can not add a cubit to his stature , but he can add'many years to the span of his life . The average New Yorker , for example , lives fifteen years longer now than he did forty : five years ago . The average life expectancy in this city in 1880 was 40 ; today it is 55 . And New York in this instance is a fair example of the rest olthe United States . During the past twenty-five years alone , death has been put off eight years for the average American . These added years have not been given to the American people by a beneficent Providence , but have been won for them by the conscientious and deliberate efforts of the nation 's public health forces  --  city health officers , visiting nurses , re-search workers in the laboratory , with their educational campaigns , their clinics , their inspections , their serums and their vaccines . It is a serious question whether the modern city and the urban civilization built around  --  it would have been possible at all without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sikty years ago ? the American city faced a losing fight for its survival . The more thickly people congregated in those days , the greater were the ravages of disease , until deaths in New York , for example , came at the rate of 38 to every 1,000 of : the population ( and births were only 29 , while irr the Poorer sections of town the death rate ran up to over 45 . It was then that sixteen of the leading young physicians of New York  --  at least six of whom subsequently became nationally famous  --  formed a Council of Hygiene , made the first thorough health survey of an American city , and issued a ringing challenge the value of which history has amply demonstrated : Come what events there may to affect the physical , social , political or commercial interests of the city , let it be borne In mind that sanitary science and its preventive skill are of more value to our fellow-beings and to this city than all the curative arts , medicine and surgery ; that the evils which now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger the sanitary safety of all other - classes and multiply the social perils and public burdens of the city . Their challenge was accepted and today preventive medicine and public health work are firmly established institutions in almost every city of the land . While our city-dwelling grandparents lost one child out of every four before it was one year old , we lose but one in sixteen ; and Dr. HAVEN EMERSON sets . one in twenty-five as a perfectly possible goal . New York 's death rate has already dropped from E8 to 11 per thousand , and might go , under ideal conditions , Dr. EMERSON says , to 9 . As a purely economic matter , public health work pays ? prodigiously . " The price of one glass of milk a year , " says Dr. EMERSON , " is all that it costs the city dweller " to have his officer of health guard " him against milk-borne tuberculosis , " typhoid , scarlet , fever , diphtheria , " epidemic sore throat and multi " tilde of minor disorders . It costs us " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of communicable " diseases , which as a group have been " reduced 75 per cent . in the past fifty " years . " Dr. Louts DUBLIN of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company has calculated that had the $5,000,000 Pittsburgh filter plant been built in 1904 instead of after the 1907 ' typhoid epidemic , " a life-waste of $9,0+90,000 " from that disease alone might have " been saved . " In the face of facts like these our expenditures for public health still seem trifling , indeed , and the outcry in some quarters against serums and vaccines a mockery of progress .
