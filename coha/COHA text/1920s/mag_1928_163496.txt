Last week Candidates ' Row got a recruit and he was : <P> Mr. Walsh . Thomas and James are his first names , reversing the order of the names of his embarrassing colleague in the Senate , James Thomas Heflin . Another distinction between these two-who are the Senate 's most complete opposites except for the label on their politics-is that Senator Walsh , from rocky Montana , is the outstanding Roman Catholic Senator , while , as everyone knows , Senator Heflin from swampy Alabama mortally hates and fears the Roman Pope . <P> Senator Walsh has a brain , too ; a patient , unbending , inexorable instrument in which he takes a chill delight when he brings it to bear on an Oil Scandal or a Power Probe . Unbending , unemotional , he has been called unique : " an Irishman without a sense of humor . " Not until the past few years has he shown ambition nor , until very recently , even sufficient self-consciousness to trim up his Montaneering mustache of iron grey . <P> There are a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waked up , a popular one being that his prosecution of the oil gangsters excited the admiration of potent political patronesses , such as Mrs. J. Borden Harriman , president of the Women 's National Democratic Club , who in turn have taught Senator Walsh to appreciate himself . Another theory is that , after his wife died in 1917 towards the end of his first term in the Senate , he turned to politics with fresh concentration as other bereaved men will turn to business , pleasure or a new wife . He started life as a school teacher . Lately he has become more and more a political disciplinarian : grim , Dry , statuesque . <P> The transformation of Senator Walsh from a granitic moral asset of his party to an actual candidate was a William Gibbs McAdooing . Ever since he magnanimously withdrew his own name , for the alleged sake of party harmony , it has rankled with Mr. McAdoo that Candidate Smith did not do likewise . Mr. McAdoo is so Dry that he has sworn he would do almost anything to make Candidate Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to me but- . " What better agent for this purpose could Mr. McAdoo have found than a Dry and a Catholic whose prestige began to surpass his own as long ago as the 1924 convention ? At that convention , Senator Walsh waved aside sure acclamation for the Vice Presidential nomination . Last week , he accepted with dignity , pride and an accent already presidential , the news that a band of California delegates , headed by Mr. McAdoo , had declared for him and wanted to enter his name in their primary . Said he : " I was importuned some time ago to allow my name to be used and I simply said I would not veto it . " News followed that Walsh movements were afoot also in Wisconsin and South Dakota . Said Mr. Walsh : " I have no campaign plans and no thought of quitting my duties here in Washington to promote my candidacy , if such it may be called . If my services to the party have been such as to entitle me to consideration . . . I dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . "
