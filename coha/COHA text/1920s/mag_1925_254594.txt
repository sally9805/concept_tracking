Myth gathers quickly around fabulous events , and already newspaper myths are gathering around the origin of the first newspaper appearance of the famed Scopes case ( see EDUCATION ) . <P> At first , it was labeled as a press-agent stunt for Dayton , Tenn. , but that theory seems to have been disregarded . Last week Editor and Publisher and The Fourth Estate , two trade journals of the newspaper world , printed diverse accounts of the origin of the Scopes story in the press . <P> Editor and Publisher Version : When Scopes was arrested , a lawyer , Wallace Haggard , said to E. F. Robinson ( proprietor of the drug store where Scopes was arrested , President of the Dayton School Board , and correspondent in Dayton for The Chattanooga Times and Nashville Banner ) : <P> " Let 's telephone the story to the Times . " <P> Robinson refused to waste 30 , so Haggard made the call . Next morning a three-inch item appeared in the Chattanooga paper-and then the news spread , and more and bigger stories were demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberties Union , an organization fighting illegal arrest and other invasions of civil liberty , sends out from time to time a bulletin containing a score or more of mimeographed items , three or four lines long , telling about cases that interest it . These bulletins go to newspaper offices where many of similar kind are received and cast on the floor . One of the bulletins contained the story of Scopes ' arrest . In the Manhattan office of the Universal Service ( a press association ) , an editor who happened to be a Tennesseean picked up this bulletin from the floor . He knew about the Tennessee anti-evolution law , and from the little item in the bulletin wrote the first story to go out on the wires of a national press service . Next morning , it appeared on the first page of The New York American ( Hearst ) . Universal Service sent out stories on the case for four days before other national press services decided the case was worth taking up .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
