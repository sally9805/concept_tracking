THE DELECTABLE MOUNTAINS- Maxwell Struthers Burt-Scribner ( $2 ) . That this novel was still possible in the U. S. is a matter for great thanksgiving . It is a book about the " great open spaces " by an enlightened man . A strong , silent rancher marries a virtuous Manhattan chorus girl , loses her for a while , fights predatory waterpower interests , tries city life , goes back at last to the cows , mountains , little grey home and prospective patter of tiny feet . But with what a difference are these properties handled by a man who writes with a mind instead of a sack of mush ! Instead of lollipops we get literature . For pap is substituted philosophy of a distinctly austere variety . <P> The love story , in the first place , becomes a delicate , powerful study in reticences . Charm conquers incredibility when , on 24 hours ' notice , Mercedes Garcia of polyglot Pennsylvania origin marries Stephen Londreth , rancher-runaway from Philadelphia 's aristocracy . The continental poetry of Wyoming , in the second place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , racy , accurate talk of cowmen about their animals , to the ineffable silence of mountain ranges . The serious thesis , finally , that men are better outdoors than in ; that the Antaeus myth is sober truth ; that cities bury their builders ' souls , is argued with a militance amply justified by the writer 's competence . Few of his countrymen are as civilized as Author Burt . <P> This is a book of many pages , beautifully written ; of many people clearly seen and steadily sustained ; of many places viewed broadly and with insight-Paris , the Riviera , Washington , D. C. , besides Wyoming , Philadelphia and the theatres , studios , dance halls , hotels and philosophers ' retreats of Manhattan . There are quaint minutiae-a sneeze in China as the possible origin of a Manhattanite 's cold . There is no end of masticable thought and sharp aphorism ; that civilization 's aim is " to think like an angel but to function like a man " ; that sexuality is either splendid or ugly , never funny or pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman closely and often if he is to preserve an image of their love ; that an old waiter 's face is finer than that of the average bishop ( " It 's a question of faithful service " ) ; that Washington is the " Tibet of democracy " ; that understanding , humility and fortitude are the only virtues ( " to be kind when you do n't want to " ) . <P> Philadelphians will be vexed if it is true that they have " the acme of wealth and no illumination . " But Author Burt has already revealed similar truths about New York in The Interpreter 's House ( 1924 ) . Having renounced Philadelphia with all other cities , soon after his graduation from Princeton ( 1904 ) , Author Burt often visits cities , knows them thoroughly ; but his Wyoming ranch has been his home . There he has produced , besides beef and horses , short stories and poetry of high literary merit and quiet wisdom . Lately he bought an estate in South Carolina but it was to the Tetons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor , Dr. Henry van Dyke , asked for a book about mountains .
