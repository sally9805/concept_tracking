Imagine a drove of king lions , all supreme in their native wild , all meeting on terms of equality . Imagine , then , a congress of Chiefs of Police . <P> Such a congress did in fact assemble in Manhattan , last week-some 400 Chiefs from cities of the U.S. and an odd 100 from nearly every country on the globe 's crust . <P> And , truth being stranger than fiction , they behaved themselves in most pacific manner , resembled a gathering of learned pedants . <P> The opening oration was delivered by the New York City Chief , Richard E. Enright : <P> " Throughout the ages , nation and nation , races and classes , castes and creeds , have been pitted against one another in open warfare ; but when the strife is over and treaties are signed they sit down together , forget their past differences . <P> " But the open warfare declared upon society by the criminal is never ended . There is no armistice , there is no peace or hope of peace . It is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johann Schober , the Viennese Chief . After relating how he once became Premier of Austria for a year , he reported : <P> " We have in our Police Administration in Vienna 270 academic men-I mean men educated at the university who had taken the examinations for the bar and other professional pursuits . The influence of these men has been great on the education of our policemen on the streets . " <P> Later , the congress listened to the man whom Sir Basil Thomson of Scotland Yard called " the best scientifically equipped man in the police profession . " This was Dr. Salvatore Ottolenghi , who established the first police school in the world . <P> Roman traditions go back to the last century when Lombroso advanced his theory of the " born criminal type " *and practically originated the science of criminology . Ideas have gone far since then , but the concept of the criminal as lit subject for scientific examination and treatment has persisted . Dr. Ottolenghi is an outstanding exponent . " Even today , " said he , " many estimable authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ... A pickpocket who for future identification is merely ' fingerprinted ' may , if properly examined , be found to have highly developed homicidal tendencies . The same may be true of any mere misdemeanant-just as a patient brought to hospital because of a minor disorder may be found to be suffering from a serious contagious disease of which his obvious condition was a premonitory symptom . " <P> But the Manhattan hosts interrupted the academic calm as best they could . They took the delegates-including Shu Tze of China-to examine a complete museum of bandit instruments . They called upon Shinzo Uno of Japan to show cinemas of police work during the Tokyo earthquake . They passed resolutions on coordination of finger prints and demonstrated the telephotograph . By this means , three finger prints were flashed to Chicago and in five minutes two criminals ' names were telephoned back . ( The third was not in the Chicago files . ) <P> Nor were parades forgotten . One there was for the local police led by red-haired John F. Hylan , the city 's mayor .
