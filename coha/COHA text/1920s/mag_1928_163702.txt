CATHERINE-PARIS - Princess Marthe Bibesco-Harcourt , Brace ( $2.50 ) . This faithful chart of the peregrinations of high society in pre-War Europe is shocking evidence of just how pre-War dull those peregrinations were . Rumanian born , but bred in democratic Paris , Princess Catherine marries an Austro-Polish count , who withdraws immediately to his round of mistresses , leaving his consort to make her rounds of pompous European courts . Though Franz Joseph , Wilhelm II , and the Czar are the objects of the princess 's irony , they prove as boring to her as to her readers . Not until she gets back to her beloved Paris , and a Parisian lover , does she come glowingly to life , and then in vain , such is the relentless requirement of her position . <P> Princess Bibesco ( not to be confused with the writer-daughter of Margot Asquith ) presided at 18 over the Rumanian legation in Teheran when her husband was minister to Persia . She prefers living and writing in Paris .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
