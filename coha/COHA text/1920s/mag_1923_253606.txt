According to Lincoln Steffens , American publicist , Mussolini likens the Fascisti to the Bolsheviki . The following words belong to Steffens , but the ideas are alleged to be Mussolini 's : " Every country in the world has a throne , and every throne in the world is vacant ; excepting only the thrones in Russia and Italy . No matter what the form of government is , be it a monarchy or be it a republic , there is sovereignty somewhere and a place for the ruler . But the ruler can not be elected ruler . He can be elected president or premier , for , if he is elected , he can not rule ; not as a dictator . No , the only way to reach the throne is to seize it . How ? <P> " Russia showed the way . The dictatorship of Russia was taken by the Bolsheviki , an armed minority , and the majority were glad . We Italians saw that , and so the dictatorship of Italy was taken by the Fascisti , a minority armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost all the people of Italy , were relieved and satisfied . They did not want to govern themselves . They wanted someone to take power and govern for them , and when I stepped up and said I would do it , the people of Italy sighed a sigh work , leaving me and my council to attend to the common business . If I do n't do it , the Italians will get rid of me , but they will take on another dictator . Italy is a dictatorship for a long time to come , and the reason is that the Italians prefer that kind of government . " <P> On April 21 ( the 2,676th anniversary of the foundation of the Eternal City ) , Premier Mussolini issued a decree establishing the Italian Labor Day on that date instead of May 1 . Thus the date of Rome 's foundation becomes a national holiday .
