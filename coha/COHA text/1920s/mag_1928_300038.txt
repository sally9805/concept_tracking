White Lilacs . With appropriate adaptations of waltz and mazurka , the Shubert Brothers offered this glib and pleasant operetta based upon the life of famed Composer Frederic Franois Chopin . It stresses the episodes in which the composer was seen about with George Sand , meeting her at the home of the Countess d ' Agoult and playing or grieving with her at Majorca . <P> The Operetta is the most romantic species of the art of the stage . Hence in White Lilacs there is not much effort to trace too accurately the mazy path of history . Nor is wit important to the operetta , and White Lilacs puts business before pun . Guy Robertson ( as Chopin ) , De Wolf Hopper , Odette Myrtil supply these ; the legitimate copies of the composer 's original tunes especially help produce in White Lilacs an engaging show . <P> The High Road . Had Author Frederick Lonsdale chosen to write a true and biting comedy instead of an exceptionally witty tragedy he might have made The High Road an even more exciting reiteration of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an actress loved by an heir ; like the tortoise in the fable , the actress is the winner . <P> That such would be the outcome could be surmised as soon as the older members of the heir 's family straggled elegantly into a very British drawing-room , each one mouthing some prejudicial reason why no actress should be allowed to scuttle out of the stage door and under the portcullis . When the actress , name of Elsie Hilary , appeared suddenly and without warning in front of this kangaroo tribunal , she had only one defender beside her betrothed scion . This was the Duke of Warrington who , immediately sensing that the actress had every intention of breaking her engagement without encouragement from Lady Minster , Lady Trench , Lord Trench , Sir Reginald Whelby , Lord Crayle or the family butler , urged that she be invited to visit in the gloomy castle until boredom drove her away from it . <P> Of course , Elsie Hilary , instead of allowing all the lords and ladies to arouse her ennui or resentment , aroused in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke of Warrington to a feeling more ardent than approval ; and since she loved the Duke , she ended the agreement with her first lord . But the Duke of Warrington had an old flame whose husband died at just this inopportune moment . Elsie Hilary therefore compelled him to go to her rival rather than come to her in dishonor . Having so neatly forced an opportunity to show how Elsie Hilary had been trapped by the absurd codes and customs of the class in which she had been unwanted , Author Lonsdale showed instead , and very prettily , that the actress was the finest gentleman of them all . <P> English wit on the Manhattan stage consists largely of crossing the slang out of comic strips and reading them in a British accent . But comic strips can be and are often funny ; the best comedy in The High Road is out of " Bringing Up Father . " Lord Trench ( Frederick Kerr ) is Dinty Moore to his wife ( Hilda Spong ) who refers to him as " you horrible old man ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse . Edna Best who plays Elsie Hilary is superior to Ina Claire in that she can deliver an epigram without tying her lips into a cupid's-bow knot ; in some other respects she is her equal . The High Road is flawlessly cast and flawlessly acted .
