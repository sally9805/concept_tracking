boys is vacation time for the boys who do the exploring of waste places hither and yon about the North Pole . They are home at the moment , warming up , collecting money , making speeches , and buying airships , huskies , gumdrops and the other romantic items of the explorer 's kit bag  --  in preparation for the season that starts next Spring . Welcome indomitable and loquacious ex-plorers ! WE have always been under the impression that the United States Navy had the most efficient publicity department of any organization in the world . Otherwise , we have said to ourselves , how can they so consistently keep in the picture section and on the front page ? But this is unfair . Any organization that suffers so many disasters and has so many things said against it as the Navy needs no publicity agent .

New York City as a whole might never learn to know its Debutantes by sight . TEN years ago daring debutantes were smoking at formal dances at Sherry 's  --  out the window or behind the fountain in the Palm Room , and handing the cigarette to their escort when danger threatened . And they are still doing it at formal dances . But now from Boston comes the cheering news that ladies are to be allowed to smoke in the open . We say cheering , because it will mark the passing of the wallflower menace . If there exists such a thing as a conscientious stag in this modern age , it will be good news to him . For no man will feel he has to dance with the nice but unattractive girl sitting gloomily on the gilt chair if he knows she can go into the smoking room at any time and put her feet up .

NEW YORK UNIVERSITY announces that it will conduct a most worthy course in Greek over the radio this winter . While recognizing that all men are better off with Greek than without it , we can not at the moment think of anything more wholly out of key with the radio audience than a course in the revered subject . One thing it may do , however ; and that is put at rest the American suspicion that Bre-ke-kekex ko-ax ko-ax from the " Chorus of Frogs " must have something to do with either the inhabitants of France or the Yale Campus .

Sporting Words COLLEGE presidents may bewail the emphasis placed on football , and in some instances , I believe , justly ; but there is one matter in this connection they can never control ; and that is the amount of newspaper space devoted to collegiate contests . For the college student is an item , and a definite one , both in circulation and in advertising prestige . How much so may be realized from the experience of the Times , of which I heard lately from a newspaper man . The Times last Spring sent questionnaires to the leading colleges of the East , seeking to establish the collegian 's preference in newspapers , which information , it was believed , would show the supremacy of Forty-third Street , West . Greatly to the inquirer 's surprise , a definite leaning towards the Herald Tribune was established . Further analysis revealed the reason , which was none other than the Herald Tribune 's excellent sporting pages . Those collegians who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rice 's Odysseys , and those with desire to see bubbles pricked might have their fancies tickled by the gay Major McGeehan . And , so , deprived of what would have been excellent advertising copy , the Times did the next best thing . It ordered that all sports writers have their signatures printed , and that all sports accounts go to press without editing ; no , not even a set of quotation marks were to be permitted for so plebian a word as " sucker . " This , I believe , explains the sudden departure from anonymity which puzzled readers of the Times some months ago . Policed THE meretricious incandescence which is Second Avenue below St. Mark 's In-the-Bouwerie , is to push southward , cutting its way through the wall of Houston Street . The plans are tucked away in some municipal cubbyhole , waiting the slow turning of political machinery . And when the Avenue kicks itself free , it will scatter into the tumbrils of wrecking crews no less than the National Winter Garden Burlesque itself . Hearing , I wandered eastward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which for years I had received free passes . For it has long been the practice of the Messrs . 11Iinsky , genii of National Winter Garden , to " circularize New York , " sending out , to first one group and then another , passes , with alluring little notes signed " Irene " or " Alice " or such . Thus is Houston Street brought to the attention of Wall and of Park Avenue . The Minskys have made from their tepid adventures ( they own the famous Apollo on Fourteenth Street as well ) a cool fortune , a fortune which is as a glamorous flower grown from a swamp . I have seen and I advise : do not succumb to feminine propaganda and bring a lady . . . nor rely too much on the power of your " admittance free , " for over the portals THE NEW YORKER hangs a placard reading " After January first a nominal charge will be made on all passes . " Ironically , it is an ascent one makes to the temple of burlesque . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into the huge , barn-like hall with the concrete rafters , one is the personal guest of the police force . " Keep movinl On yer way ! " Perhaps a thousand men are gathered  --  and half a dozen women , placid women . God knows why they are there ! One must take off one 's hat as soon as he is seated . A heavy , intimidating officer is in the wake of the usheress , electric torch in hand . " Take off yer lid ! " The curtain rises , under a hand painted legend " The Show 's The Thing , " signed " Will Shakespeare . " But the steady patrolling of the aisles never ceases . Up and down pass the blue coats . One may smoke , the heavier the cigar the better , one may laugh , snicker even , applaud . . . but let so much as a single word , a wisecrack , critical or appreciative , rise through the fuming blue atmosphere : " Click ! " A sharp rap on the uncovered head from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law in Houston Street 's burlesque .

Up and down , swinging clubs , flashing spotlights . A crashing of cymbals  --  the finale ! Like mice or sheep or cows they file out . Only a Iucky few get their five story elevator ride ; " down this way ; fire escape too good for yuh , eh ? " Police-haunted , they go forth into the world , the world of East Houston Street and Second Avenue  --  except for those others , from here and there , who sort themselves out , climb hastily into taxis and speed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present trend in shifting art centers was the recent announcement that the entire collection of the late Viscount Leverhulme was to be brought to the United States for auction  --  this after the heirs had arranged for a sale of the art effects at the nobleman 's country seat , The Hill , Hampstead Heath . An agent of a local gallery , dispatched abroad for the purpose , indicated to the heirs suavely , of course ? that Britishers were not going in for extensive art purchases at the moment . Americans compose perhaps nine-tenths of the market , with , strangely enough , Germans comprising the remaining portion . So , said the American agent , why not offer these works for sale where it will be most convenient for wealthy Americans to attend the auction ? This argument took effect , particularly when the heirs realized that Hampstead Heath was as conveniently located as regards London , the logical British center , as would be , say , Doylestown , Pennsylvania , for New Yorkers . Accordingly , the Leverhulme Collection is coming here and will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in late Winter . February is most likely . THE value of canvases is always a ticklish matter to discuss . Experts can disagree about this feature most cordially ; and so the layman is forever at a loss . The significant feature of local discussions of the Leverhulme collection is that authorities place so little stress on the canvases themselves . This is surely a puzzling condition when there are , among others , examples of Hals , two Rembrandts , a Goya , two portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds , a Gainsborough ; and portraits , also , by such eminent masters as George Romney  --  in whose work , by the way , there is a great revival of interest because of the sugar-coated version of his affair with Lady Hamilton provided by a recent novel  --  Sir Thomas Lawrence and Sir Henry Raeburn . Among the moderns there are canvases , to mention a few , by Sir John Millais , Sir William Orpen , Jacob Maris , Harpignies , and L'Hermitte . Connoisseurs , however , display most interest in the fine collections of rare laces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late Viscount assembled . His library , too , of which caricatures of the Georgian Period form a most interesting feature , is said to be magnificent . They are in twenty-five folio volumes . And there is , also , what is said to be the first sketch book by George Cruikshank , whose genius was clearly cated even in the rough pencil drawings of his extreme youth . This one item , alone , should pack the Anderson Galleries with Dickens and Cruikshank enthusiasts , what time the Leverhulme Collection is exhibited  --  if the whole town has n't flocked to the Floridian real estate marts by then . Suspense SOONER or later , of course , Ber-k- , nard Shaw and A. H. Woods were bound to be the central characters of a theatrical story . It has arrived , not much beyond schedule . Mr. Woods , then , called upon Mr. Shaw in London . " Write me a play , sweetheart , " said Mr. Woods . " I have one here you may have , " said Mr. Shaw . " It 's called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , " said Mr. Woods . " ' Well , " said Mr. Shaw , " it takes three nights to play . " Mr. Woods picked up his gloves and toothpick . " Not for me , " he said . " I like to know the day after my first night if I 've got a hit or not . " Tercentenary CELEBCELEBRATIONS of the tercen-RATIONS of New York 's founding have begun , and perhaps there is as much historical warrant for the choosing of any time as for the selection of that date next Spring still to be definitely agreed upon . As usual , when historians disagree , they make a layman 's decision difficult , this time for the committee already busy with the details of the official affair , in which both city and state will be invited to participate . It is planned that this forthcoming celebration will be underwritten for six millions of dollars by a combination of private and governmental agencies , although it is expected that the event will prove self-supporting . Grand Central Palace and the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exhibits and memorabilia which will form the major features of the affair . And , no doubt , there will be speeches . There always are , unfortunately . The current exhibition in Wanamaker 's , arranged under the paternal eye of Dr. Grover Whalen , late of Mayor Hylan 's forces , has not escaped criticism by those who know their old New York . Such an item as the raw intrusion of two gas pipes in the panel , depicting General Washington taking the oath of office as President , is one of the defects to which our elders object . The showing of Marion Davies 's picturization of " Little Old New York " ? perhaps due to the one-time association of Dr. Whalen with Mr. Hearst , through his Hylanic affiliations  --  has proved particularly irritating . Ilistorically , it is ridiculous in spots , particularly in the scene wherein a woman is whipped in a public square of this city in the year 1840 . The cruel practice of flogging had been abandoned almost a century before . Yet there is undeniable merit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are based on authentic contemporary prints , and are laudably faithful to the originals . The portraits of gentlemen eminent in the older life of the city likewise are admirably done . And on the whole , although criticism always makes a deeper imprint than praise , this exhibition at Wanamaker 's  --  the herald of the city 's tercentenary  --  is worthy of a visit by anyone who knows , or wishes to know , something of the history of the town . The Ponies ALONGALONG towards the end of the week , the early afternoon tide of overloaded taxis which sets northward towards the environs of Yonkers and the Empire City Race Track will wax strong , and , on the thirtieth , die away . Flags will come down , stalls take board fronts , and the Sport of Kings will be ours only in the afternoon newspapers until another season . Belmont and Jamaica have already closed ; the rattletrap inconvenience to the north is the scene of the last stand . We have been hearing plans , of late , of the consolidation of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it would be pleasant if such a move might bring us some of the color that the sport has practically everywhere except about New York . At Empire City , these last days , one perceives how strange our tracks have become . High up in the stands , groups a small coterie , smartly dressed , chatting intimately . One hears such names as Averell Harriman , Payne Whitney , Larry Waterbury , Cosden , Coe , Sinclair . Below and about , stands gape until one comes to the wider spaces of nominal entrance fees . There the taxi tide has beached a pushing , shoving , good-natured crowd , as anxious in their instructions regarding ten dollar investments as are those in the rarified atmosphere above over as many thousands . To the few , the flashing thoroughbreds mean sport , intimate sport of owners and their friends , speaking in timately of each others ' horses . The mass below is that small part of the city 's race track gamblers who must sit by the table to play , watch the turn of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same newspaper information of the rest , who play the track by telephone , harried until the first racing newspaper extra comes out . And , at best , the two together are but a small fraction of our city . There is a shoddiness to our metropolitan tracks , uninviting , if the love of the sport , the horses themselves , the oambling entailed is not in the spectator . In ten days , Empire City will be a deserted park , disdained by straggling motorists in passing . The small coterie will be seen here and there  --  Louisville , Lexington , Bowie ; the taxi riding mass , the table inaccessible , will be playing still , but over the shoulders of the newspaper dopsters . ? ENTLEMAN dining with Mr. kir Arthur ( Bugs ) Baer at Friars Club is continuously disturbed from seat to answer insistent telephonings . During third visit to booth , waiter asks : " Shall I serve Mr. J 's steak ? " " Yes , " replies patient Mr. Baer , " he 'll ? take it in the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculate upon 1 how greatly Mr. Otto Kahn was influenced in his recent discussions in the press of the Metropolitan Opera problems by the evidence he has at hand in the career elected by his son . Here is the offspring of wealth , bred in the conservatorial atmosphere of the musical and graphic arts , turning , at near maturity , to that strange combination of roistering bluster and soft , almost erotic minors which is now jazz music ? and which is also thoroughly American . Not that Master Roger Wolfe Kahn is one of our foremost exponents of jazz music ; he is more important as a symptom . I watched him last week , on the Palace stage , a little chap , in the midst of a great noise , wagging his arms vigorously . He kept perfect time . He was very didactic . He was most precise . When the time came , he took his bows , curtly , like a lad bowing for a diploma . Only when he began again , this time with a basket of instruments by his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays no less than ten ) did a ripple of genuine enthusiasm sweep the great house . But all of his numbers sounded extraordinarily alike ? they could have been one long sweet song . His only departures were in his jazzified classics . TFIERE is speculation in what another generation may think of young Kahn 's career , for his is just beginning and he may go far in the new school of jazz symphonies . The tale is romantic . He practiced by stealth in the great Kahn house at Ninety-second and Fifth Avenue ; he slipped away , fearing his father 's orthodox disapproval , to substitute for various instruments in the great jazz bands on Broadway . He fell in with Arthur Lang 's band , played on it and later hired Mr. Lang for his own orchestra . It was a bandsman in Paul Whiteman 's orchestra who gave him away  --  let slip a tip to the watchful Variety which brought the cohorts of the press to besiege his father 's house . From the explosion that ensued , he won the right to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would engage him . Mr. John Bowman saw the opportunity , took it , and Roger Wolfe Kahn became the leader of the Biltmore Cascades orchestra . But this was only the beginning . There was still the stage for Roger Kahn to conquer . He had had Mr. Walter Kingsley of the Keith-Albee tribe pass upon his band and he obtained at last permission to try the Hippodrome . There were THE NEW YORKER " Look ! Do my nails shine from there ? " stepped in , for there came to Mr. Roger 's side , one Bert Cooper , vaudeville manager , wise pilot of Broadway . The one thing that might have hurt Kahn 's son was his simplicity ; Mr. Cooper 's nimble brain is a bulwark in the defense . And now Roger NVolfe Kahn has arrived . It was when the Dutch Treat Club , with its imposing array of critics , made him the guest of honor last week , a place hitherto filled , in jazzical circles , by Messrs . Whiteman and Lopez only , that his father capitulated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can underwrite him for all I 've got . " Expositions HAPPENING in upon that old annual stand-by , the Electrical Exposition , which has been going on at the Grand Central Palace during the past week , one found that housewife 's paradise not without its dramatic contrasts . One went , presumably , to view electrical flatirons and coffee percolators . And one stumbled over lighthouses . Although , stumbled over , does not express it precisely when beams like those which shine at Sandy Hook and Cape Hatteras hit you in the eyes , and a fog bell reverberates in your ears , across the not-so-great open spaces of an exposition floor . This demonstration , which was staged by the government lighthouse service , was only one of several which stood out spectacularly against the neat array of domestic contraptions . The Navy and the U. S. Bureau of Mines afforded their measure of relief to the mind grown weary with contemplating refrigerators and washing machines . But the best touch was supplied by the army signal corps which exhibited a fine flock of carrier pigeons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an electrical show . ? AS a preliminary to the late Avia- tion Meet at Mitchel Field , the committee in charge arranged for rain insurance . " How about wind insurance ? " the agent inquired . " It will add only ten per cent to your premium . " Not at all , not /t all , the committee demurred . And so , on the Saturday which was expected to be the most profitable day of the meet , the wind blew a hurricane and the flying races had to be called off . It is expected that for the next aviation meet , wind , gust , gale , and hurricane insurance will be authorized . Progress ANEW brownstone front gleamed on the house , and in the parlor window was a neatly-lettered sign . The Gentlemen of Parts stopped and gazed at it , Then he read the house number . It 's the same place , he mused . There 's a story behind that house , said the Gentleman of Parts , abruptly . I wandered in there one night , long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor ran through the entire first floor , but thick , velvet curtains screened the windows from outside gaze . They had a small orchestra . You danced , if you wished ; bought wine  --  all the rest . Decorous , for such a place .

You understand , of course , what sort of story I am implying was behind that house . Well , look long at that sign , commanded the Gentleman of Parts . The neat letters , fashioned on the sign behind the window pane , took form and heralded the headquarters of that militant crusader , Mr. John S. Sumner  --  The New York Society for the Suppression of Vice . C'est la guerre , murmured the Gentleman of Parts , and walked away .
