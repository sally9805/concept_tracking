For two days last week the Chamber debated the famed Fascist Labor Bill ( TIME , Nov. 30 ) , which provides that in every art , craft , trade or profession , two Fascist syndicates shall be established , one representing capital , the other representing labor . Further it is provided that only these accredited syndicates shall have authority to settle labor disputes , and that all such disputes shall be compulsorily arbitrated by them . <P> Beneath the frown of Dictator-Premier Benito Mussolini one Fascist after another arose to find only words of praise upon his tongue : " A great step forward . . . Fascist unity of Labor , Capital and the State ... a death blow to the Marxian theory of class struggle . " <P> At length a timid Communist piped : " I think this measure would be justified only if Italy were at war . " From the tribune Il Benito looked down , far down : " I consider the Italian nation in a permanent state of war ! ... I consider the next five or ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition is growing ever keener . . . . Even as controversies are not permitted at the front in wartime , so now we must realize the maximum national efficiency ... <P> " When you cast your votes , remember that this law is the product of the Fascist rgime . . . . Our regim can not be beaten . In this certainty lies our faith in the law . " <P> Shortly afterward the measure passed amid the usual Fascist acclaim .
