Iguanas <P> In London , the iguanas ( giant lizards ) in the zoo last week refused all nutriment . Lonely and cold , their hearts aswoon for the drowsy sweetness of the jungles of Brazil , they pined in languor , gazing with lacklustre eyes at troughs filled with such tasty morsels as corn , ants , dead flies , bread and mice . Keepers conferred . One day huge electric lights were strung along the lizard house . The iguanas awoke out of their nostalgia . They wriggled joyfully in the light of the strange and sterile suns above them ; crept to the troughs , ate greedily . <P> Tadpole <P> In Erie , Pa. , high-school children ( watched by a chemistry instructor ) set out to investigate . Filling a bowl with equal parts of whisky and water , they placed therein a red perch . It lived four seconds . A bullfrog lasted 13 seconds , a bass one minute , a sunfish four minutes . Then a tadpole was dropped into the bowl . It lived . <P> Sermon <P> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to preach his Sunday sermon . He rolled his trousers up to his knees , exposing two fine stretches of fatted calf . He unbuttoned his shirt , baring a chest mottled with a biblical growth of curly hair . Then he mounted his pulpit . " I want to show the girls , " he announced to his gasping , giggling , shrinking congregation , " how they look to others when . . . they wear short , sleeveless , low-necked frocks . I strongly . . . condemn such costumes . They bring tears to the eyes of the girls ' elders . " <P> Engaged <P> In Newton , Mass. , last June , Mrs. Eunice J. Esten , 75 , lay dying . By her side sat Alonzo H. Blood , 76 , waiting , watching . In his pocket was a marriage license . If Mrs. Esten was actually dying , he would marry her then and there , for the two old friends had made an engagement long ago to be married before death divided them . With the promise of happiness before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that he would not have to marry her after all . He went away . Last week Mrs. Esten again fell critically ill ; back came Mr. Blood with a minister and license , and sat by her bedside , watching , waiting ... <P> Santa <P> In Newark , N. J. , a little man named Gustave Zobel , 70 , stood in an artificial beard and a preposterous red coat , on a street corner , ringing a small bell . By performing this simple act for a certain number of hours every day he earned enough money for food and bed . Why it should give joy to anyone to see him standing in the cold wind tinkling a dinner clapper was more than Mr. Zobel could determine , but since The Volunteers of America were ready to pay for such mummery , it was not his part to find fault . He attracted a good deal of attention from passing children , which was disagreeable to him . One morning last week he got up too late to eat breakfast . As the hours passed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little drum pounded in the back of his neck . Suddenly his bell slipped out of his hand and jangled , with a thin note , to the pavement . Mr. Zobel pitched forward on his face . Death , said the city doctors , had resulted from heart failure .
