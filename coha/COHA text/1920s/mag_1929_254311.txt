One hundred years ago an Oxford student wrote to a friend at Cambridge suggesting a boat race between the two universities . Came the answer : " Your impudence is unparalleled . The sufficiently candid manner in which you talk of ' lasting us out ' ( ! ! ! ) amuses me so much that I am ready to die of laughing . . . . " So the first Oxford-Cambridge race was arranged . <P> Last week perhaps a million persons lined the Thames from Putney to Mortlake . It was the centenary of the famous struggle between the light blue and the dark . Forty times had impudent Oxford won . Thirty-nine times victory had gone to Cambridge . Once , in 1877 , the judges could name no winner , for the crews finished together to the stroke-a dead heat . <P> The sun broke through a light fog as the rival strokes dipped their blades . There was a hush-then cheers . For a moment the lighter Oxford crew drew ahead , with nervous high strokes . Another hush . Then the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . At Craven Steps , marking the mile , Cambridge led by three-quarters of a boat-length , stroking 30 to the minute against Oxford 's 32 . At Chiswick Church , which marks two miles , Stroke Brocklebank had geared his men to 29 strokes to the minute and they had increased their lead to two lengths . On and on-past Duke 's Meadows , Barnes Bridge , Mortlake Brewery and finally to the finish line the Cantabs sped with steady rhythm . They finished seven boat-lengths in the lead , rowing the four miles in 19 min. 24 sec . <P> Buoyed by victory the winning eight seemed fresh at the finish . Not so the losers . Only H. C. Morphett , No. 5 , sat erect in the shell . His seven were slumped in collapse . They were hurried to the boathouse . Six revived quickly . The seventh , P. D. Barr , bow , remained unconscious for 30 minutes . He had taken his place in the shell though ill with influenza . <P> The victory was the sixth straight for Cambridge , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light blue even with the dark . Next year the two will start another century of boatracing.
