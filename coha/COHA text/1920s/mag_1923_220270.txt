Money rates remain unchanged , even the variable call rate fluctuating closely around 5% . The advance of the New York Federal Reserve rediscount rate last week to 4% was reflected in the rise in the ratio of that bank from 79% to 80.6% . Bonds remained unsettled , and , though stable , seem to have reached a high level for their present movement . Public interest is plainly going over to stocks , and to appreciation in price rather than rate of interest return . <P> Foreign exchange rates , after their recent wild fluctuations , proved steady . In the case of German marks , which remained at the same low level for more than a week , this was extraordinary when it is remembered that the Reichsbank successively issued 440 billion and 420 billion new paper marks during the past two weeks . Indeed , almost 1 trillion marks , or about 50% of the present outstanding issue , were added during February . Under such conditions it is plain that the present efforts of the Government to stabilize German exchange rates are foredoomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
