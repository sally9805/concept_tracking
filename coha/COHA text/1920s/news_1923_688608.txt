txt Latest of achievements Upward in an airplane is that of Flight a British aviator , who this at Speed . week rose to a height of 20,000 feet in 12 minutes and 21 seconds . That is not quite se fast as a rocket goes up for a much shorter distance , but it is at the rate of almost a mile in four minutes , and is sufficiently astonishing , considering the amount of work the engine had to do in raising the heavy machine and its adult passenger . Perhaps the roost remarkable thing about the exploit is that a man could survive a change of air pressure as great as he must endure in gaining an elevation . of nearly four miles in a time So short . The strain upon his heart and lungs must have been enormous , and he might have been expected to suffer at his highest altitude in some degree the same symptoms shown by caisson workers after they have been under high air pressure and come too suddenly out of it . No reference to this is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record , so presumably it was the last of many trials , in the course of which tolerance of such changes had been gained . Yet many airplane accidents are ascribed to the effects of such alterations of air pressure , one of the effects being the temporary loss of consciousness just at the moment ' of landing , when the aviator needs all his skill .

That learned man discourses with great contempt about one BOILS , whom he calls a conscienceless charlatan because he " asserted that all diseases were caused by small animals enclosed In the blood , that each disease is due to different anlinals , that these mischievous animals have each of them In particular other animals for their enemy , which pursue them and destroy them , like hunting dogs destroy hares or hawks destroy pigeons ; that he knew perfectly well various kinds of animals which produce each kind of disease , and those which are most contrary to them and which may be of use to heal the disease ; that he knew remedies which contained these helpful animals in the greatest abundance , and that he , therefore , possessed the art of healing in a radical manner ail diseases by a very safe , very brief and very efficient method .
