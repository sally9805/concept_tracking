The stage King and Queen were to have quarreled with their Prime Minister over whether religious or medical agencies should be invoked to cure the Crown Prince . <P> Spain 's invalid Crown Prince , the Infante Don Alfonso , suffers from exactly the same dread and peculiar disease , haemophilia , * which afflicted the Tsarevitch Alexis , son and heir of Tsar Nicholas the Last . The Tsaritsa and the Tsar are well known to have fallen a prey to the notorious " Black Monk " and hypnotist Gregory Rasputin , whom they devoutly believed to be the only person capable of curing the Tsarevitch . In Spain rumors have long been irresponsibly current that Queen Victoria Eugenie has employed an obscure Catalonian doctor to attend the Infante Don Alfonso . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacinto Benavente 's play and issuing the following communique : " The dramatist has been authorized to issue his work only in a revised book form . It is believed that the public , when it knows the work , will realize it would be dangerous to the people 's spiritual tranquillity and peace of mind to allow it to be performed .
