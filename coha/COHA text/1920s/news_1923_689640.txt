txt The English election this week will probably be indecisive . Fought out on the major issue of protectionism , it seems now a good forecast that after the voting is over It will be most difficult to tell ' whether the country ' has or has not approved the abandonment of its eighty-year-old free trade policy . There are 015 members of the British House of Commons . In the last Parliament the Conservatives had 340 , the Labor Party 144 and the Liberals 117 members , while eight votes were scattered . This gave the Government a ? .. i ? : , .. joHts- ? f seventy-seven . The , .. r ... i. : .. , ing opinion in London today , three days before the voting , is IIthat Premier Baldwin 's party will retain power , but with a reduced majority . No one outside the professional party boosters expects the Conservatives to gain . I and it seems to be generally agreed that t they will lose fifteen , twenty or twenty ! five seats  --  the estimates depending somewhat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats would i cut Baldwin 's majority to thirty-seven . As for the Labor Party vote , observers think that it will scarcely hold Its own and may lose from five to ten seats . The Liberals would , therefore , appear to stand to win some twenty-five seats . This would indicate then that the next 1 House would have about 325 Conservetives , and , with the same number , eight , of scattered members , there would be a close race between the Liberals and the I Laborites for the place of the official Opposition , each with some 140 votes . This is only a guess , naturally , but it is a fair r  --  sum ? of the various guesses now being made in London . But even if Baldwin has a majority in the next House , It does not necessarily mean that his protectionist program will go through with flying colors . In the first place , if the Conservatives find themselves with a reduced majority . it is doubtful whether Baldwin can call the result of the election an approval by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the second place . it ' is by no means certain that every Conservative member would vote for protection . The Conservatives have formed a great party in England for many years . when the country was well satisfied with tree trade , and to assume that all of them will be converted so quickly is going rather strong . It is evident that with a majority of only twenty-five , ten or fifteen bolters might imperil the Pre- i mler 's program , although . on the other I hand , it is possible that protective measures , if presented not as one whole program , might win defections from Labor members whose particular constituencies would profit from a tariff . One reason why it is so hard to forecast what would happen to the protec- tion program in the , event of the preelection forecasts coming true , is that Mr. Baldwin has made no definite announcement of what sort of protection he means . Lloyd George 's Success a Personal One . Mr. Lloyd George has been having a great personal success in his whirlwind campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . election material with which to make a dramatic appeal . He is for the continuance of free trade . and that amounts to his having to assume the position of simply being against the reform proposed by Mr. Baldwin . His performance for the Liberals completely overshadows that of Mr. Asquith . who appears to make no strong popular appeal . It is understoo ? 1 that Mr. Lloyd George has no hope of his party obtaining a majority of the seats in the House , but he hopes to drive his party in ahead of the Labor Party and thus make it the official opposition , which he would lead in the Commons , thus placing himself in a position of great advantage for the next election , which even now , it is predicted . will come within a year . The plea of the Liberals that protectionism.will mean higher cost of living seems to be balanced by the deep-rooted British desire to get rid of the unemployment problem  --  a result which Mr. Baldwin promises if the protectionist policy is adopted . Many Englishmen figure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i paying if it ended in an expenditure of nearly ? 150,000,000 yearly in doles for some 1,300.000 unemployed . Capital Levy Hampers Laborites . ? Whether it wilt work out that way no one yet can tell , but the voters will be obliged to make up their minds by next Thursday . The Labor Party seems hampered rather than helped by the advocacy of the capital levy . J. Ramsay 1 and some other leaders , it is reported , I would like to get away from the issue , but the left wing of the Labor forces holds them in line . Outside of Labor , quarters I can find no one who predicts that Labor will gain in this week 's , 1 balloting . Foreign politics play a very small role 1 in the campaign . All three parties would like to see France get out of the Ruhr . but all three lack any real program for forcing her to do so . There are various party cries , like making the League of Nations stronger , calling reparation conferences whether France comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has introduced any new ideas cn world affairs . All in all , it is far from a clear-cut election . While on the one hand it seems a situation where any result could be explained , yet the best observers agree in predicting that there will be no enormous charge when the results are known next Friday . By reason of the reconciliation and team work of Asquith and Lloyd George rather than for any other cause the Liberals appear most likely to make gains . But they have no chance for a majcrity , it being an issue between them and the Labor Party for the honor of having the greatest number of o .. osition votes . A study of the election speeches shows that Baldwin and his lieutenants are not presenting arguments which I are convincing the electors in ' any remarkable way . There is a widespread sentiment in England that the economic situation of the country is getting bad . and that perhaps it would not be unwise to try Mr. Baldwin 's panacea . But there is no popular enthusiasm for his almost overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not for unemployment his program would not have a chance , it might also be said that it was precisely because of the condition of which unemployment was a symptom that he recommended the change . The London Times will publish tomorrow a forecast , giving the Conservatives 321 seats , Labor 125 , the Liberals 105 , scattered 6. with 54 uncertain ; but of I the 54 The - Times thinks the Liberals will get the larger part . The Times . which is strongly Conservative , foresees a reduction of the Conservative majority ' of 77 and thinks it will be somewhere between 27 and 50 , basing its prediction on reports from its correspondents in all parts of the country . Pleading Baldwin 's cause . The Times asks the voters to give him a real working majority in the next House of Commons . and says that those who vote for Lloyd George will be throwing away their votes as they might throw a penny into the hat of a roadside comedian.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
