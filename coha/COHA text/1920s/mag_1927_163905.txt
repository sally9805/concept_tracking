Sirs : <P> Sending subscription for two years means that I find you interesting , instructive , not indispensable . . . . <P> MISCELLANY is good , RELIGION mediocre , BOOKS tolerable , NATIONAL AFFAIRS great , but I would n't take your TIME to prepare for eternity . <P> FLOYD H. ADAMS <P> Pastor , Lincoln Square Baptist Church Worcester , Mass . <P> <P> Ill-Advised <P> Sirs : Yes , I know what TIME is-and I abhor it . I never subscribed ; it was sent to me by an ill-advised female relative . WALTER LOWRIE <P> The Rectory , St. Paul 's Roma , Italia <P> <P> P. B. K. T. B. <P> Sirs : <P> On page 17 , of TIME , Jan. 3 , there appears an item headed " P. B. K. T. B. , " dealing with the establishment of the Phi Beta Kappa Tutoring Bureau at this university . . . . <P> In the first place , the Bureau is not a " new departure " as it is referred to in your item . It was organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has today . In the second , place , the item makes the following statement : <P> " From Harvard came news . There those who , by dint of native ability or sustained effort , had achieved the personal triumph of a ' key , ' would now transfer some of their attention to furthering the common weal , and to lining their own pocket-books . " There never has been , and so far as I know never will be , any remuneration connected with the tutorial services of the society here ; nor , I believe , at any other place . . . . EDGAR M. HOOVER JR . <P> In charge of Phi Beta Kappa Tutoring Bureau Cambridge , Mass . <P> <P> Ten Bigger <P> Sirs : Newsstand Buyer James Chester Pope 's letter amuses me . ... If I were to say what I think of his Big Ten , TIME could not publish my letter if it would , and I wish Mr. Pope could see if possible a list of ten men who actually possess elements of greatness . ... I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upton Sinclair , Theodore Dreiser , Eugene O'Neill , Rupert Hughes , William Allen White , John Dewey , Alexander Meiklejohn and Loredo Taft . . . . <P> J. E. DAHL <P> Mobridge , S. D. <P> <P> Proper <P> Sirs : TIME is unusual . In your Jan. 10 issue , under heading of " Elk City , Okla. , " p. 4 , col. 3 , you refer to Letter Carriers , which is the proper designation of the men of Uncle Sam who deliver the U.S. mail . Invariably , the Press and the Public refer to them as mailmen or postmen , which is highly improper . . . . Frank Crane . . . recently eulogized the Letter Carrier and referred to them as mailmen rather than Letter Carriers . . . . A mighty small thing , yet I believe every Letter Carrier appreciates being referred to as a Letter Carrier . Thanks to TIME for setting a precedent .

RIDGWAY <P> Ypsilanti , Mich . <P> Sirs : <P> TIME , sophisticated , with no inferiority complex , has been my frequent luncheon companion ; its morbid MISCELLANY ( TiMB , Jan. 3 , p. 20 ) discourages such hospitality . <P> ERNEST C.
