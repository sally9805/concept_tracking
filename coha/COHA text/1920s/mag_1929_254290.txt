A thin-faced man in dusty clothes stood last week in a courtyard near Vera Cruz . He blinked nervously before a group of photographers and then turned to a file of brown-skinned soldiers . <P> " At this solemn moment , " said he , " I wish to be an example for the army . I die tranquilly , with the knowledge that I did what I believed to be my duty , but I counsel all not to follow my course . Now boys , shoot here " - he held his hand over his heart- " do n't hit my face . " <P> Rifles cracked . A moment later the rebel General Jesus M. Aguirre , who captured and later fled from Vera Cruz ( TIME , March 18 ) , lay on the ground , bleeding slightly from the mouth . The photographers , who were there by order of President Portes Gil , took more pictures to prove that the execution had really occurred . <P> A few hours later , in Chester , Pa. , kind-hearted Brigadier General Charles Eliot Hyatt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cadet Leon Aguirre , to his private office . He told the boy that his father had just been executed , as had his uncle , Gen. Manuel Aguirre , the week before . <P> " My boy , " said the General , almost as affected as the white-faced cadet before him , " you must be a good soldier , a husband to your mother , and a father to your sister . " <P> " Yes , sir , " said Cadet Aguirre , saluting . Mess call sounded , and Cadet Aguirre marched with his platoon into the dining room . Other cadets gazed round-eyed over their beef stew and cocoa at a classmate whose father had actually died in the profession for which they were training .
