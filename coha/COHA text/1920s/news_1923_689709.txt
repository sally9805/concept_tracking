txt Henry Ford Is the happiest man in the world and he is happy because he has understanding of the first law of happiness  --  service . He is the richest man in the world with the largest income ; but neither his wealth , nor his income , is the source of his happiness . Daily , almost hourly , he beholds the added fruit of his labors in service to his fellowman exemplifying the promised reward of the Psalmist ? " Thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands ; happy shalt thou be , . and it shall be well with thee . " Henry Ford is likewise , from a financial standpoint , one of the poorest men in the world , for his labors and the financial fruit of his labors are enslaved in advance for the upbuilding of that transportation service for which he so pre-eminently stands . His construction plans today call for 110,000,000 and he has expectations of earning it the coming year , but with no large margin . Rut rich or poor , Henry Ford would be just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go round for the benefit of his fellow workers . True happiness is found in true labor and there is no true labor without true service . ASTONISHING ; SIMPLICITY People who have thought of Ford as a man with grasping ambitions for self-aggrandizment must have been astonished at his recent simple casual announcement ? " I 'm for Coolidge . I would not consent to run on any ticket against him . I think all the people feel that President Coolidge means to do right ; and when a man means to do right it is usually quite easy for him to find the way . " This certainly does not sound like a scheming politician seeking to magnify his own importance or to occupy the center of the stage with captious criticisms . OUT OF THE POLITICAL FIELD Since the accession of Mr. Coolidge to the Presidential chair Wall Street has felt satisfied that no further service could be performed by pressing the claims of Henry Ford as its logical candidate , however , much Wall Street may be a worshipper of material success , autocracy and financial accumulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field in which he never placed himself , it may not be amiss to discuss the enigma of Henry Ford  --  that combination of strength and weakness . The strength of Henry FortSve have indicated above . He understands as do few people the great law of service and that it is the only road to happiness  --  human or divine . WHY FORD IA MISUNDERSTOOD The wizardry of his inventive genius is possible only from the standpoint of his denial of that which he does not understand . He does n't understand partnership or shareholding relations , because the way of genius in invention is not by way of partnership . He sees only the creative mind that snakes for invention and organization and has'never had opportunity to lift his sight to the benefits of capital in organization accomplishing wonders of progress under very ordinary men , both men and capital satisfied with very 1 ordinary terms . To Henry Ford the stockholder is only a parasite fastening itself upon industry and constructive brain work . Instead of that he really represents the savings 1 and accumulations2of labor working for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing brainpowcr . FORD AND TIM METALS Henry Ford works in steel , its alloys and combine1 tions ; sees iron as the king metal that should rank with gold in durability , if only its carbon could be economically I removed therefrom . He does not see the psychology of gold with organized humanity , and , therefore , denies the i right of gold to hold superior place in balancing the world 's leconomics and finance . If he saw gold and silver in their true relations , he would have less faith in iron and steel and would be a poorer worker therein . The very narrowness of his vision enhances his service to the world . FIGHTING FARM ECONOMICS He has rebelled against farm labor from his youth as economically unsound , involving tremendous waste and idleness from unbalanced labor . Therefore , he seeks after synthetic milk and abolition of the dairy cow and the farm horse , which enslave farm labor .

FORD AND WALT , STREET Of course , to Mr. Ford Wall Street is likewise a parasite upon the country . Ile does not see it as the longest street in the world assisting mightily in the credit structure which makes possible the exchanges in human production . If Henry Ford had studied Wall Street he might have been sidetracked from a useful career , as have so many men , by an attempt to invent a system that would create wealth without service . The ignis fatuus of Wall Street , luring so many men to destruction , is the idea of Wall Street as a local place where men with " tips , " guesses ana gambles , may tap off a percentage from money or savings in its passing from one industry to another . It does no harm for Henry Ford to deny the service of gold , the usefulness of credit , the value of money in ? exchanges , or the service to the community of the small stockholder . He must honestly deny them as a genius in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few people there are who understand these matters in detail !
