Time : 1870 . The stage is hung in dark curtains , the center is lighted and the figures which walk into the light are framed by darkness . An old mahogany sofa , upholstered in black hair cloth , is the only furniture in the scene . A girl of twenty sits on it  --  dressed in an evening gown of the period . The skirt voluminous with ruffles and lace . Her arms bosom and shoulders are bare  --  but the fashion of her hair is demure and maidenly with the proverbial curl and rose . She fans nervously with her diminutive fan , waiting and watching . She is soft and pretty and flower-like . Her voice is sweet . Shyness and modesty are her manner . Her movements are graceful and coy and mincing  --  full of a conscious charm . An orchestra from a seductive distance is playing an enticing polka . A tall good-looking fellow of twenty-five  --  in the evening dress of the period  --  comes quickly into the scene . MARY THE FIRST Good gracious ! How did you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . MARY THE FIRST I did n't ! The idea of you thinking such a thing ! WILLIAM ( Heavy , honest and simple minded ) p. 3 I thought you said as soon as you finished that dance with Hiram , you 'd come in here . MARY THE FIRST I may have said I might but I did n't say I would . WILLIAM Well , I hoped you would . MARY THE FIRST Where 's Lucy ? I did n't suppose you 'd be looking for me when you were dancing with her . WILLIAM I finished . MARY THE FIRST Are n't you going to dance this one with her ? It 's your favorite polka and now no one in the world dances the polka so well as Lucy , of course . WILLIAM No one but you . MARY THE FIRST Oh , that 's what you used to say . But you ca n't say that any more . Go on . Do n't keep her waiting . WILLIAM Who 's waiting for you ? MARY THE FIRST I wo n't tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you danced with him ? MARY THE FIRST How do I know ? WILLIAM Every other dance . Is this his , too ? MARY THE FIRST I 'm not dancing with anybody this time . I 'm just sitting here resting . It 's so sweet and quiet . Listen ! Is n't the music sweet ? I shall always think of you , William , when I hear that music . We 've danced to it so many , many times . Oh , I ought n't to have said that . WILLIAM Why not ? MARY THE FIRST I must n't say those things now . And you must go . There must n't be any more of these sweet little stolen moments under the stairs . This is really good-bye , William , is n't it ? WILLIAM No , it 's not . Unless you want it to be . MARY THE FIRST Oh , me ! Do n't say me . What have I to do with it ? WILLIAM Everything . It all depends on you whether it 's good-bye or not . MARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear little Lucy ! I hope you 'll be happy with her , William . Good-bye . ( Giving him her hand daintily , and drawing it away at once. ) p. 4 WILLIAM What are you goin ' on like this for ? Nothing 's going to be any different for you and me . MARY THE FIRST Oh , do you suppose for a minute she 'll ever let you dance with me again ? WILLIAM She ca n't help herself . MARY THE FIRST Oh , you do n't know her  --  as I do . I love Lucy very , very dearly . She does n't mean to be  --  WILLIAM What ? MARY THE FIRST Nothing . I ought not to have said that . WILLIAM Said what ? What are you hiding ? MARY THE FIRST Oh , I 'm not hiding anything about Lucy . Good gracious ! I would n't have you think that for anything . Oh dear . Oh dear ! Rather than have you think that , I 'll tell you right out what was on my mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's very , very strong and stubborn and always gets what she wants . She wo n't let you be my dear old friend any more . She 's been very cold to me lately and there ca n't be any reason for it unless it 's because she does n't like you to like me  --  even a little bit . WILLIAM She ca n't stop that . MARY THE FIRST You must n't say that . It 's all over now . WILLIAM It never would have been over if you had n't preferred Hiram and his money . MARY THE FIRST Oh , do n't blame me . But it is over . So let 's not talk about it . Let 's just be happy for a moment here . . . in this sweet little corner where we 've sat so many , many times . WILLIAM We 'll sit here again sometimes , too . ( Trying to take her hand which she finally allows him to do after a modest struggle. ) p. 5 MARY THE FIRST Oh , never , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought to know that , William . You ought to know that I will be loyal to Lucy always  --  above everything . Nothing shall ever dim my devotion to her . Dear , dear little Lucy ! I must be true to her . WILLIAM What about being true to me ? You ca n't throw me away like an old shoe  --  just because I 'm getting married . I 'm not going to throw you away , let me tell you . MARY THE FIRST Oh , but you 're a great , big , strong man . You can do as you please and still control your feelings . I 'm only a weak little thing . I would n't dare try to go on seeing you after you are married . I might not be able to hide my feelings . WILLIAM Hide what feelings ? What kind of feelings have you got for me , Mary ? MARY THE FIRST ( Turning away and brushing a tear from her cheek ) No kind . Good-bye , William ! You must go . WILLIAM I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean and just how you 're feeling . MARY THE FIRST No  --  No  --  it 's too late . WILLIAM It 's not too late . I 'm not tied up yet . We can change things . MARY THE FIRST Oh , no  --  no  --  Lucy ! WILLIAM I 've got more money than Hiram has now . More than he ever will have . Granddad left me rich , Mary . I 'm a rich man now . If I thought you still cared for me the way you once did  --  nothing could hold me back from getting you . MARY THE FIRST Oh , William  --  William , you must n't say that . ( Taking the rose from her hair , smelling it and holding it to her lips ) p. 6 Take this and keep it and look at it sometimes when it 's faded and think of me . Perhaps I 'll be faded , too . Is n't it pretty ? WILLIAM Not half so pretty as you are . MARY THE FIRST Oh ! WILLIAM Your cheek is much softer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a thing ! It could n't be . See . Look ! ( Holding the rose to her cheek and bending near him . He kisses her cheek ) Oh  --  how could you ! How could you , William ! Oh  --  you 're hurting my arm ! You 're going to make it black and blue . There , look at that red spot . Kiss it and make it well . Oh no  --  I must n't say that . ( William kisses her forearm , her elbow , her shoulder and her throat . ) Oh , William  --  you must n't ! WILLIAM I wo n't let anybody else have you . Are you engaged to Hiram ? MARY THE FIRST Oh , what does it matter ? WILLIAM I never have loved any other girl . I never will . MARY THE FIRST And do you think I 've ever loved any other man ? Oh , I ought not to have said that . But I will say it , just this once before we part forever . I loved you as no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bending over her hands and holding them to his lips. ) p. 7 MARY THE FIRST We must be brave , William , and say goodbye . WILLIAM ( Kneeling before her , his head bowed in her hands . ) I ca n't  --  I ca n't  --  do n't ask it . MARY THE FIRST It 's too late . You 're pledged to another . You must be true to her and live a beautiful life , William . WILLIAM I ai n't going to do it . You 're my fate . I 'll blow my brains out if you do n't marry me . I 'll kill anybody else that gets you . MARY THE FIRST ( sobbing ) But fate is parting us . WILLIAM Look here . I 'll have the horses ready in an hour . You go home and put on your riding habit and meet me at the cross-roads in an hour . MARY THE FIRST No , no , William . I could n't  --  I could n't . WILLIAM ( still on his knees ) You 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've got to take hold of things . Nothing can stop us . This is meant to be . MARY THE FIRST Then it would be wrong to let anything separate us . It 's stronger than we are , William . Eternal and beautiful like the stars . But , oh , I ca n't do it , William . Never  --  never in this world can I do it . I 'm not sure that it would be right . I 'll be behind the oak tree . It 's bigger than the maple . WILLIAM ( getting up ) p. 8 You angel ! MARY THE FIRST Do n't you bring Fleetfoot . I 'm afraid of her . Bring Silver Star . Will you love me forever ? WILLIAM Forever and ever . MARY THE FIRST In this world and the next ? WILLIAM Longer than eternity . MARY THE FIRST There never has been a love as great as this . I feel it . I know it . Oh , William , I love you so ! I love you ! ( They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed together as the light fades ) @x Time : 1897 . The light comes on again and shows the same sofa with a tall , fair , rather sthetic looking boy standing by it . He wears evening clothes of the period and is examining closely a dance program , checking off numbers with a small pencil . An orchestra is playing Sousa 's " Washington Post " twostep with great swing and pomp . A dark boy , more sturdy in appearance , also wearing evening clothes , comes into the scene quickly . HOLLISTER ( as he comes on with smiling self-assurance ) Hello , Richard . Who 's the dude dancing with Mary ? RICHARD ( with injured dignity ) I thought she was dancing with you . HOLLISTER No , I have this next one with her . RICHARD Oh no . I have it . HOLLISTER You 're off your trolley . It 's mine . RICHARD You 're mistaken . She has it with me . HOLLISTER You better go find her , then . I think I 'll wait here ( throwing himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very sure of yourself . HOLLISTER You bet I 'm sure . RICHARD You 're not going to stay here and make a scene , are you  --  over a little thing like this ? HOLLISTER I have n't anything to make a scene about . I 'm just waiting to dance with Mary . If that 's painful to you , why not withdraw so you wo n't suffer so much ? ( The orchestra changes to " Daisy Belle " and Robert sings a verse with a gaiety intended to madden Richard . ) Daisy , Daisy , give me your answer true , I 'm half crazy all for the love of you . It wo n't be a stylish marriage  --  I ca n't afford a carriage , But you 'll look neat  --  upon the seat  --  Of a bicycle built for two . RICHARD Oh , do n't ! It 's bad enough to have to dance to anything so vulgar  --  without hearing the words . HOLLISTER I 'm stuck on the words . RICHARD You probably are . They 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter with my vocabulary ? RICHARD Nothing . I dare say it expresses everything you think  --  very adequately . HOLLISTER Meaning my intellect is not so colossal as yours . RICHARD I could n't be so rude as that . HOLLISTER Suppose you clear out then before I say something so rude you wo n't care to hear it . RICHARD You 're making a fool of yourself . HOLLISTER ( Rising quickly ) p. 11 I 'll show you who 's the fool ! MARY THE SECOND ( Coming into the scene out of breath ) Oh , I 'm nearly dead ! Mamma made me dance with that old man . ( Mary is the perfect Gibson type  --  in dress and hair and figure . ) HOLLISTER He 's got cheek asking you . He must think he 's a young masher . Come on , this one is ours . RICHARD It 's mine , Mary . MARY THE SECOND Oh  --  which one is it ? ROBERT AND RICHARD The tenth  --  a twostep . MARY THE SECOND No , this is an extra . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me see your card . RICHARD Let me see it . MARY THE SECOND ( Hiding her program ) No ! HOLLISTER ( Showing her his ) Look at this . There it is  --  the tenth  --  perfectly plain . RICHARD ( Showing his card ) Nothing could be plainer than this . MARY THE SECOND That 's funny . Well  --  the next one is an extra . One of you can have that . HOLLISTER It 's mine , anyway . MARY THE SECOND I 'll tell you what let 's do . Let 's divide this one . I 'll dance the first half with you , Robert , and the other half with you , Richard . HOLLISTER I do n't see why I should give up half my dance . RICHARD Oh , give it all to him . You 're wasting time talking about it . MARY THE SECOND Now boys , do n't be silly . I 'll stay here and sit it out . The first half is Richard 's . Go on Robert . I want to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this . MARY THE SECOND It 's a sweet thing for you to do . Ta-ta . ( She turns her back to Richard and blows a small kiss to Robert. ) p. 12 HOLLISTER I 'll be back in a jiffy . ( He goes out . ) MARY THE SECOND ( Sitting on the sofa ) Now we can talk . RICHARD How could you ? MARY THE SECOND How could I what ? RICHARD I do n't care anything about the old program . ( Going to her and tearing the program in two ) I want to know what you said you 'd tell me tonight . MARY THE SECOND I 'm not going to tell you anything when you 're in that kind of a humour . RICHARD What kind of a humour did you expect me to be in ? MARY THE SECOND The kind you were last night  --  when you 're different and not like anybody else . RICHARD You were different  --  too  --  you made me believe you would marry me and tonight you 've hardly looked at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RICHARD What are you thinking ? MARY THE SECOND Life is wonderful . I want to live it wonderfully . RICHARD We 'll live it wonderfully  --  together . Our souls are like one soul . MARY THE SECOND Yes , but our dispositions are n't . Sometimes we feel alike . When you read poetry to me we 're awfully high and exalted , but when we 're just going along in an every-day way we are n't a bit alike . RICHARD Well , it 's better to be alike and feel alike on the heights than in commonplace things that do n't matter . MARY THE SECOND But I believe they do matter . I wonder which matters the most . RICHARD Which are the more important in the world  --  the great things or the little things ? MARY THE SECOND Oh , of course , of course  --  but the trouble is when you do ordinary little things that I do n't like , I forget the great ones and I could just  --  RICHARD Just what ? MARY THE SECOND Just kill you . RICHARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARY THE SECOND I wonder . I wonder if it is my fault when I hate you and yours when I love you . I do love you sometimes  --  Richard . RICHARD Oh , Mary , we belong to each other . We were meant for each other  --  in our real selves . MARY THE SECOND But I 'm not sure which is my real self . You see , Richard , it 's this way . Now listen and see if I can make you understand . Sometimes you 're the most wonderful thing in the world . You say things that no one else says  --  and you think and feel and understand  --  and then sometimes  --  RICHARD It 's you who do n't understand . Listen dearest  --  HOLLISTER ( Dashing in ) p. 13 Time 's up . Slide , Kelly , slide ! You must have said everything you ever thought of by this time . RICHARD Oh time does n't matter . ( Rising slowly ) A minute  --  or eternity are all alike . HOLLISTER You do n't say ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank you  --  and you 've had more than your share . Skip . RICHARD ( Looking at Mary as he goes ) Eternity . HOLLISTER ( After Richard has gone ) Dick 's got ' em again . What in the name of Heaven , do you scrape up to talk to him about ? MARY THE SECOND Oh , lots of things . HOLLISTER Does he spout poetry to you all the time ? MARY THE SECOND It would n't hurt you to have a little poetry , too . HOLLISTER ( Laughing and sitting beside Mary ) All right . I 'll get some . Anything you say . What more do you want me to have ? MARY THE SECOND You do n't think much about  --  HOLLISTER About what ? MARY THE SECOND Oh , about things that are n't just things . HOLLISTER What ? MARY THE SECOND You see , you do n't even know what I 'm talking about . HOLLISTER How can I tell what you 're thinking when you do n't say anything . MARY THE SECOND That 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , all right . I 'll find out how it 's done if that 's what you want . MARY THE SECOND Oh ! HOLLISTER What 's the matter , little girl ? I 'll give you anything on earth and the moon and stars thrown in . Honest , Mary , no man ever loved a girl the way I love you . And I 'll never change . That 's the point . MARY THE SECOND What if you did ? It would be horrible . HOLLISTER But I would n't . I could n't . How could I ? You 're meant for me . You 're mine . We suit each other . Do n't you trust me , Mary ? MARY THE SECOND Oh yes , I trust you  --  but getting married is forever and ever and ever . HOLLISTER Of course . MARY THE SECOND And Oh  --  unless two people do love each other  --  Oh , in the most wonderful way  --  that nothing can change  --  HOLLISTER Like us . MARY THE SECOND Now listen , Robert . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms ) p. 14 You do n't need to . I do understand . I know all about it . ( He covers her face with kisses . ) I 'll make you the happiest girl in the world . I love you . And we 'll never change . Never . MARY THE SECOND ( Clinging to him ) Oh , if it could be that way , Robert ! HOLLISTER Of course it will be that way . Nobody ever loved anybody the way I love you . You 're going to marry me , are n't you ? You know you are ! Say it ! MARY THE SECOND Yes . HOLLISTER Do you love me ? MARY THE SECOND Oh I do , Robert  --  and we must make it the most wonderful love that was ever in the world . ( He folds her in his arms as the light fades ) @x Time : 1922 . Summer . Place : The living room in the Robert Hollister house . It is the conventional room of conventional success  --  filled with a certain amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The walls are made by the same draperies used in the first two scenes  --  with the frames of the doors and windows set in . The furniture is a mixture of old and new  --  brought into harmony in dull tones . The sofa that is seen in the first scenes is now upholstered in chintz . Late afternoon in summer . At Curtain , Mary the First at 75 , and Mary the Second now 45 are in the room . Granny  --  Mary the First  --  sits on the sofa , still somewhat the pretty and spoiled darling  --  still a trace of coquetry in her soft blue frock . She is knitting a blue woolen scarf on large needles . Mother , Mary the Second , grown into a handsome full-blown rose  --  wears a gown and hat in good style and unobtrusive prettiness . She comes in by the long window  --  a little warm , a little bored and tired . MOTHER Hello , Mother . GRANNY Back ? p. 16 MOTHER Oh  --  It 's hot ! ( Sitting listlessly in a comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball of wool ) Who was there ? MOTHER Oh , everybody . GRANNY Did you have a good time ? MOTHER Not very . GRANNY You 're a funny woman , Mary . I do n't see why you ever go to a party . You 're so indifferent about it . MOTHER What else is there to do ? GRANNY When I was your age I never missed a party . Euchre was a much better game than bridge too . Much more sociable . You could talk all you wanted to , and I usually took the prize . MOTHER I 'll bet you did , Mother . GRANNY Did you play for money ? MOTHER Yes . GRANNY How much did you win ? MOTHER I lost . GRANNY Serves you right . Ladies and gentlemen did n't act like professional gamblers when I was your age . Mary , let me tell you something . From something I heard Mary drop the other day I would n't be at all surprised if she plays for money too  --  sometimes . p. 17 MOTHER I should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does ? MOTHER How can she help it , Mother ? Everybody else does . GRANNY You could put your foot down hard and forbid it . ( Mother smiles again and reaches for the afternoon paper on the low table near her  --  and opens it indifferently . ) GRANNY I know Robert does n't know . Are n't you going to tell him ? MOTHER I do n't think so . GRANNY You ought to . At least he 'd try to put a stop to it . Robert certainly does try to make his children what they ought to be . He certainly tries harder than you do , Mary . Do n't you think he 'd try if you told him ? ( Mary , reading , does n't hear . ) Mary ! MOTHER Un ? What ? I beg your pardon , Mother . GRANNY I say do n't you think Robert would try ? MOTHER Try what ? GRANNY Try to put a stop to Mary 's playing cards for money , if he knew . MOTHER I expect he would . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does . p. 18 GRANNY You do n't help him much . You 're certainly not bringing your children up the way I brought you up . MOTHER And do you think you did a good job on me ? GRANNY At least I did a better one than you 're doing on her . Look here ! ( Drawing a box of cigarettes out from under one pillow and a box of matches from another ) Look here ! It is n't enough to have them laid out on every table in the house . They 're stuck under everything you touch . I expect to find them in my own bed some night . Why she has n't set the house afire long ago I do n't see for the life of me . MOTHER I do n't either . GRANNY And look at this ! MOTHER What ? GRANNY A hole burned right through this sofa by one of those abominable things . MOTHER Oh , that 's a shame . GRANNY I should think it is . It 's my sofa , too , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat on it in her house the night I told your father I 'd marry him . MOTHER Well  --  that was a great moment for us all , was n't it ? p. 19 GRANNY Yes , it was . You need n't be sarcastic . And here 's Mary abusing it . Sitting on it morning , noon and night with boys  --  boys  --  boys . Do you know how many boys she has sat on it with ? MOTHER No , I do n't . I served my time at sitting on it , myself . GRANNY That 's what I say . All sorts of things have happened on this sofa and here she is treating it like  --  with no respect at all . MOTHER Were you taking care of the sofa when you were sitting on it ? GRANNY Of course I was . And so were you . I did n't allow you to abuse it . You were taught to take care of things . MOTHER I do n't seem to remember that . GRANNY Seems to me you 're forgetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me you 're getting very hard and worldly as you grow older . MOTHER Nonsense , Mother ! There 's nothing hard about me . I wish there were . GRANNY You wish there were ! There you are ! That 's a hard thing to say . You 're getting more like everybody else  --  callous  --  just callous . You let things slip and you 're not holding up strict enough standards to your children . p. 20 MOTHER Yes , I know . Let 's not start that , please . GRANNY There you go ! You do n't care a fig about what I say . There was a time when people thought what I said was of some importance , and listened to it  --  too . MOTHER Oh Mother dear , I do listen . GRANNY You have no more respect for my opinion than that . ( Flicking her fingers ) BOBBY ( Dashing in from the outside ) Mother are you through with the car ? MOTHER Y-e-s  --  but what do you  --  BOBBY I left my racket out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He starts out and turns back . ) Oh Granny , another button 's busted off this coat . Will you sew it on please ? ( Putting it on the table . ) GRANNY Yes , dearie . Do n't put it there . Give it to me . You ca n't put anything down in this house if you ever expect to get it back . BOBBY ( Going to give her the button ) See  --  it came off here and it sort of took a chunk of the coat with it . p. 21 GRANNY You bad thing ! I s'pose I can darn it . Here , you keep it . I mended sixteen pairs of socks for you this morning . BOBBY Thanks . MOTHER Mind you 're back in time for dinner Bobby . Your father will probably want the car tonight . BOBBY I 'll hurry . MOTHER And do n't drive too fast Bobby . GRANNY I 'll never go with you again if you drive the way you did yesterday . BOBBY Oh you think anything over five miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) GRANNY Bobby 's a sweet child but he 's getting to be a ripsnorter too ,  --  just about as bad as Mary . Both of them are as wild as colts . MOTHER Well  --  after all they 're my children and if I do n't mind the things they do I do n't know why you should . GRANNY Your children ! Anybody would think I had n't brought up a family of children of my own . MOTHER I expect you were a much better mother than I am , dear . GRANNY I know I was . You 're shutting your eyes to things that are right under your nose . Robert does try . I will say that for him . Robert 's peculiar in some ways , but I must say he does try to bring up his children right . p. 22 MOTHER ( Seeing a letter on the desk and opening it to read ) Robert is always right . GRANNY I do n't say that . But he certainly is as right as most men are . As men go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very fortunate woman . MARY THE THIRD As women go , I suppose I am . GRANNY I sometimes think you do n't appreciate him , Mary . I sometimes do . MOTHER I 've spent my life appreciating Robert . GRANNY I do n't know why you would n't . . . a man who has succeeded as he has and put you in this beautiful house . MOTHER ( Sitting at the desk to write a note ) He certainly did put me in it . GRANNY Un ? What do you mean by that ? You 're getting so sort of nifty and highty-tighty lately I do n't know what you mean half the time . MOTHER Well , I do n't mean much of anything . I would n't worry about that . GRANNY You 're not living up to the principles I brought you up with . MOTHER Mother  --  if you 'd only acknowledge that what you brought me up with has n't any more to do with the case now than I have with the North Pole  --  and stop stewing about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 GRANNY Why Mary McDougal Hollister ! That I should live to hear you say that ! What 's happened to you ? You 're different lately . What is it ? Is anything wrong ? MOTHER Everything 's just exactly as it always was . GRANNY I should hope so . You 're a happy woman . If you 're not , you ought to be ashamed of yourself . When I was your age , it was the fashion to be happy . Women loved their husbands and appreciated their blessings . Or if they did n't they did n't air it from the house-tops . MOTHER No  --  they just lied along and covered things up . GRANNY Well land knows you have n't anything to cover up . That 's one sure thing . ( A pause . ) Have you ? MOTHER ( Sealing her letter and getting up ) Of course not . GRANNY Then what 's the use acting as if you had ? The thing for you to think about is your children and how to keep them from being contaminated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half strict enough with Mary . I tell you she 's in danger  --  actual downright danger , and you do n't seem to see it at all . MOTHER We 're all in danger . You 're in danger of becoming a fussy old woman . I 'm in danger of being swamped by the hateful ugliness of  --  respectable  --  every day life . If Mary 's got anything more dangerous than that to face , she 'll wriggle through somehow , I s'pose . ( Taking her hat and going to the hall door. ) p. 24 GRANNY And make a muddle of it . She does n't know what 's good for her . It 's your business to make her see who 's the right one for her to marry , and make her marry him . MOTHER Did your mother make you marry Father ? GRANNY She did n't have to . I knew he was the best and I took him . Did n't I help you to take Robert ? MOTHER No , you did n't , and I did n't take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and she wo n't take . She wants something different . GRANNY Wants ? Wants ? What does she want ? MOTHER Something that comes . Something you nor I ever had . GRANNY I think you 're out of your head lately ! I 'm going to take Mary in hand myself . MOTHER No you wo n't , Mother . I must ask you , please  --  to let Mary alone . MARY THE THIRD ( Coming in quickly through one of the long windows ) Mother  --  I 've got a great scheme . ( Mary is twenty  --  slender and straight as a boy . She wears a slip of a frock  --  which leaves her free  --  and she vibrates with vitality and eagerness  --  rather dynamically interested in her own affairs . She pitches her hat into a chair as she comes in. ) p. 25 MOTHER Have you , dear ? What ? MARY THE THIRD Some of us are going camping  --  Lettie and Max and Lynn and Hall and I  --  and do all our own cooking and cleaning up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can do it . We think  --  we know , in fact  --  it 's the best way in the world  --  the only way to really know each other  --  you know  --  to see each other all the time  --  in a sort of messy way  --  doing things we do n't like to do  --  and sort of getting right down at realities you know  --  vital stuff . MOTHER I see . But why do you want to know each other so well ? Why take such risks ? GRANNY I think as much ! It 's hard enough to like anybody when they 're all dressed up and on their good behavior , let alone when they 're all dirty and eating bad food . MARY THE THIRD That 's just it , Granny . That 's the point exactly . It 's a magnificent test . MOTHER But why not let well enough alone ? MARY THE THIRD Because you see  --  some of us  --  all of us , in fact  --  are in love with some of the others  --  and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what kind of love it is , and what we 're going to do with it . See ? p. 26 GRANNY You take my advice and pick out the best one and stay at home with him , and wear your good clothes every day . MARY THE THIRD ( Going to Granny to chuck her under the chin ) I bet you were the worst kind of a vamp , Granny . GRANNY I was a very modest maidenly girl , through and through and through . MOTHER Who 's going with you ? Who are the chaperones , I mean . MARY THE THIRD That 's the point . We 're not going to have any . MOTHER Oh  --  GRANNY What ? MARY THE THIRD It would be the same old thing if we did and put the whole scheme on the blink . MOTHER But you do n't mean  --  MARY THE THIRD Nobody would be natural . It would be the cut and dried conventional stuff and that 's just what we do n't want . We want to see each other as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  boys and girls together  --  without any older people ? MARY THE THIRD Yes . p. 27 GRANNY Are you stark staring crazy ? MARY THE THIRD Not at all . I think it 's a great idea . People do n't know each other before they 're married . That 's why most marriages are merely disappointing experiments instead of lifetime mating . That 's why the experimenting ought to be done before marriage . MOTHER We 'll talk about it after while , dear . MARY THE THIRD Oh Mother  --  why wait to talk ? GRANNY Yes , why ? Tell her now that it 's an unheard of , immoral , disgraceful idea to have even come into a nice girl 's head . Tell her that  --  this minute . MOTHER Wait , Mother . MARY THE THIRD Immoral ? Disgraceful ? Why , pray ? Why ? GRANNY Because it outrages all the decencies . What would you do at night , I 'd like to know ? MARY THE THIRD We 'd go to bed and sleep  --  as decently as we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , dear . MARY THE THIRD If you ca n't think of anything but that Granny , you have got an evil mind . p. 28 MOTHER Mary ! MARY THE THIRD We are n't going away just so we can sleep together . We could stay right at home and do that , let me tell you . MOTHER Mary ! GRANNY ( Rising in shocked excitement ) Are you going to do something ? Do n't you know now you must do something , or are you just going to go on sitting still ? MOTHER Mother , will you please let me  --  MARY THE THIRD If I could just talk to Mother alone once , Granny , without you interfering , I might be able to make her understand something . MOTHER Mary  --  be quiet ! Are n't you ashamed to speak to your Grandmother like that ? GRANNY No , she 's not . There 's no shame in her . She 's brazen and disrespectful and you let her be . MARY THE THIRD She is n't letting me be anything . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And I 'm talking about something very important to me which you do n't understand at all . MOTHER Mary  --  that will do , I say . Tell your grandmother you 're sorry , and do n't let this happen again . p. 29 MARY THE THIRD ( Going to Granny reluctantly ) I 'm sorry , Granny . I really am . I did n't mean to be disrespectful . Will you forgive me ? GRANNY ( Bursting into tears ) No , I wo n't . You 're an impertinent little minx , and I do n't want you to speak to me . MOTHER Oh Mother dear , do n't take it that way . MARY THE THIRD I said I was sorry . GRANNY Do n't touch me ! Nobody loves me . Nobody appreciates me . MARY THE THIRD Please forgive me . GRANNY Let me alone . You 've broken my heart . ( She goes out into the hall sobbing . ) MOTHER Now see what you 've done . MARY THE THIRD ( Closing the door ) Grandmother 's the limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet , and you have no business to say wild things you know will shock her . MARY THE THIRD What 's wild about what I said ? MOTHER You know as well as I do . Decent people do n't do those things . p. 30 MARY THE THIRD ( Throwing herself on the sofa ) Because they do n't is no reason it would n't be a darned good idea if they did . MOTHER Oh  --  dearest ! MARY THE THIRD If nobody ever did anything that had never been done before we 'd be a sweet set of dubs . People are dull enough as it is , goodness knows  --  without setting that up as the law to live by . MOTHER You 're talking from very lofty heights . Unfortunately we have to live in the valleys of common sense . MARY THE THIRD That 's the way you always get out of everything , Mother . I want to try things . What else is life for ? MOTHER You ca n't try things the whole world knows have nothing but danger and disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I could n't go any place with anybody and not stay myself  --  just as I am now  --  unless I wanted to be something else ? And then if I wanted to why of course I would , and that would be my own affair anyway . MOTHER Mary ! Stop it . If I thought for a minute , you meant that stuff , I 'd be terribly frightened . But you don't. p. 31 MARY THE THIRD Certainly I mean it . And I 've just about decided that free love is the only solution to the whole business anyway . MOTHER What on earth are you talking about ? MARY THE THIRD I do n't know that I could live all my life with one man  --  however much I loved him . Of course you and Father are satisfied with each other because you 've never had anything else . But you do n't know what you might have been , Mother , if you 'd lived with a lot of men . Experience  --  constructive experience is the only developing progressive thing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between men and women and there 's nothing true or right but the same old things that have always been true . I 'm afraid you 've been reading too much new stuff  --  trying to be clever and advanced . Do n't , dear  --  do n't . MARY THE THIRD Gosh , Mother  --  you do n't suppose anything I 've read in a book cuts any ice ? I 'm talking about me myself , and how I feel and what I want . Hal and Lynn both have qualities that attract me enormously  --  and I want to find out if I want to marry either one of them . I would n't be satisfied to be happy just in the way you and Father are happy . I want something that is beautiful , and beautiful all the time . p. 32 MOTHER Nothing is beautiful all the time . If you 're going on a quest for that you might as well stay at home . MARY THE THIRD Mother , are you and Father really happy ? MOTHER ( Startled ) Of course ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THIRD Lots and lots of times I  --  Nothing .  --  MOTHER What do you mean ? MARY THE THIRD There is n't anything really wrong , is there ? You do love each other , do n't you ? MOTHER ( Evading Mary 's eyes ) Do n't be silly . Of course we do . Now see here , Mary  --  you ca n't expect me to take your scheme seriously . . . . MARY THE THIRD But I do . What if I must do it , Mother ? What if I must to express myself  --  to find myself ? After all , it 's my life , you know . MOTHER Mary , if you 'll promise me to stop thinking about this nonsense I wo n't tell your Father , but if you do n't  --  I will  --  and he 'll  --  I do n't know what he will do . MARY THE THIRD I do . I know every snort and gesture but that wo n't make any difference if I think my happiness  --  ( Lynn comes through the lower window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollister  --  Hal of Richard , seen in the prologue. ) p. 33 LYNN Hello , Mary ! Hello , Mrs. Hollister ! MARY THE THIRD Hello , Lynn ! MOTHER Hello . HAL Hello . MARY THE THIRD Come in  --  come in . Pray do . HAL What 's the matter ? MARY THE THIRD I 've just told Mother the scheme . LYNN It does n't seem to have made a hit . MOTHER It 's too silly to talk about . You two boys ought to be men of the world enough to make Mary realize how impossible it is  --  instead of putting such ideas into her head . MARY THE THIRD They did n't , Mother . I put them into theirs . MOTHER Then get them out . I trust you , boys , you know , and when I come back into this room I expect you both to give me your word of honor that the whole thing is off . ( She goes out  --  closing the door ) MARY THE THIRD Mother 's difficult because she 's so nice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit on the sofa and taking a cigarette . Both boys strike matches and sit  --  one on either side of her , lighting their own cigarettes. ) p. 34 MARY THE THIRD ( Going on after a long puff and throwing back her head to blow the smoke  --  crossing her legs and folding her arms ) It 's almost impossible to talk to her or get anywhere with her , because she 's a perfectly happy inexperienced woman , the most dangerous kind . LYNN Dangerous ? I would n't exactly call your mother dangerous . MARY THE THIRD She 's dangerous because she 's contented , and therefore not progressive  --  stupid . LYNN Oh . HAL ( Slowly and importantly ) Of course  --  I get that . MARY THE THIRD And she represents such an awful lot of women . They have n't moved an inch for ages . LYNN Your mother 's a peach , though . MARY THE THIRD Of course she is  --  a perfect darling . I 'm crazy about her . That 's why this thing is so hard . LYNN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so mad about it , you know . MARY THE THIRD I knew you 'd be the first one to back out . HAL So did I. p. 35 LYNN I 'm not backing out . HAL Yes , you are . Give it up , old man . It 's not your gait anyway . Just drop it . LYNN And let you stick ? Not much . Do n't worry about my gait . I 'll keep up all right . MARY THE THIRD Is the first thing that Mother says going to knock it all out of you ? LYNN No  --  but people are going to talk like blazes and I ca n't stand to have you talked about , Mary . MARY THE THIRD Oh Lord , Lynn ! Do we have to begin all over to convince you ? HAL You see , old man , you 're not really with us . You 're only going because you do n't want to be left out . You do n't see it as something important to the improvement of the whole question of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lettie are n't up in the clouds the way you two are  --  you 're fooling yourselves there  --  hard . HAL I do n't agree with you . I think Mary and I have succeeded in making them see that  --  that  --  LYNN That what ? HAL That if they have n't the courage to lead their own lives regardless of other people 's moth-eaten convictions  --  they will never get anywhere or be any further along than their fathers and mothers . p. 36 MARY THE THIRD Of course , to me it 's thrilling  --  positively thrilling . I 've never done anything in my life that I like so much . It 's so simple  --  so absolutely simple  --  merely to go off and live naturally and freely for two weeks  --  doing a thing we know in the bottom of our souls is right , and knowing perfectly well the whole town is going to explode with horror . Then we 'll march back again with our heads well up and prove that we 're finer and more intelligent people than we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you know . LYNN Y-e-s  --  but what if it never was understood and accepted . It would be terribly hard on you two girls . HAL Even so  --  it would be worth it . They 'd both be doing something great . Wreckage of the individual does n't count in the world 's work . LYNN Not so long as the other fellow happens to be the wreck . MARY THE THIRD Now listen . We 've all reached the point where we think it 's worth doing . I 've even decided I must do it  --  in spite of mother . But if we 're going to get away with it , we 've got to do it quickly before the others back out and spill the whole business . I think we 'd better go tonight  --  after the party . We 'll all be out late  --  anyway  --  and nobody watching the time and expecting us . I 'll get word to Letitia , and we can pack now and put the stuff in  --  in your garage , Lynn , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No  --  we 've got to be foxy getting out of the garage  --  not get together till we 're out of town  --  then when we 're out on the road , let ' er go . MARY THE THIRD I can hardly wait ! And now  --  you boys have to promise me  --  utterly and absolutely  --  that you wo n't make love to me the whole time we 're gone . It 's going to be a square deal for everybody , and do n't forget this  --  I may not want to marry either one of you  --  and you may not want to marry me after all . You do understand  --  do n't you ? HAL I do . Certainly . You 're magnificent , Mary . If we have n't enough of your spirit in us to rise to this we 're rotters . If you do find that Lynn 's the one to make you happy I shall understand and if I ca n't take you by the hand , old man , and wish you luck  --  I shall be horribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to me , I hope I 'll have the guts to clear out and not stop to wish anything on anybody . MARY THE THIRD ( Getting up and standing between them ) You 're splendid  --  both of you . Shake . ( The boys clasp hands and she puts hers over theirs . ) Skip now before Mother comes back  --  and avoid the issue . Bye-bye  --  see you tonight . ( The boys go . Mary goes to the hall door  --  about to open it . Hal comes back. ) p. 38 HAL ( In a whisper ) Mary ! MARY THE THIRD Oh !  --  I thought you 'd gone . HAL Just a minute . MARY THE THIRD What do you want ? ( They go to the sofa and sit . Mary turns on the light in the lamp which is behind the sofa  --  the rest of the room is in shadow  --  with the same effect as in the scenes in the prologue . ) HAL I just want to say this , dear  --  that whatever happens  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my love  --  and above all on my friendship . MARY THE THIRD I know I can , old dear . I know that and it gives me such a wonderful feeling of security  --  your understanding , I mean . HAL That 's what I wanted to be sure of . That you do feel that . MARY THE THIRD Oh I do  --  I do . HAL Of course I know your soul belongs to me , Mary  --  whatever happens . We may get lost from each other , and confused and entangled  --  but that will remain through eternity  --  that our souls have found each other and understood . p. 39 MARY THE THIRD Yes , I know dear . I know . HAL And I 'm sure of you  --  now in reality . No love as great as mine could fail to find its completion . You will be sure too . I 'm not afraid . I love you , Mary . I love you as no man ever loved before . MARY THE THIRD If I were sure of that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary , as a consecration to our ideal ? MARY THE THIRD Of course . ( She kisses him with a very honest and unfeeling smack on the lips . ) HAL ( Rising with a sigh ) That will live through eternity . ( He goes . Mary goes to the door again . Lynn comes to the other window . ) LYNN Mary ! MARY THE THIRD Oh  --  I thought you 'd gone . LYNN ( Coming in ) I waited . I knew Hal would come back to say something . Just a minute , Mary . Come here . ( They sit on the sofa ) I came back to say this  --  that if I was n't dead sure I 'm going to get you , I would n't go a step on this tom fool expedition . p. 40 MARY THE THIRD Now  --  LYNN Listen ! I 'm going to take care of you and pull this thing off right , and you 're going to come back engaged to me . MARY THE THIRD Now if you 're going with any fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be growth and freedom . LYNN I do n't need to grow . I know what I want . I love you . MARY THE THIRD But that is n't enough . You do n't know that it will last forever . LYNN Of course it will . When people love the way I do , it 's got to last . You do love me , do n't you ? MARY THE THIRD Yes  --  I do  --  in a way  --  very , very much . But not in all ways . It is n't the great love that embraces everything  --  that envelops and sweeps one away  --  so there 's no doubt about anything . LYNN Tell me how much you do love me and I 'll take a chance on the rest . MARY THE THIRD I think  --  I think I 'd rather you were the father of my children than any man I ever saw . LYNN Well then what difference does anything else make ? p. 41 MARY THE THIRD But that is n't everything . LYNN What else is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . Please go . I 'm afraid Mother will come and spoil everything . LYNN ( Catching her hand ) Kiss me . MARY THE THIRD No ! LYNN Why not ? MARY THE THIRD I do n't want to . LYNN Well if I 've got to act like a dead man for two weeks  --  you might kiss me once  --  now . MARY THE THIRD No . LYNN ( Taking her by the arms ) You 've got to ! MARY THE THIRD If you do I 'll hate you . LYNN Did you kiss Hal ? MARY THE THIRD None of your business . LYNN But did you ! MARY THE THIRD ( Pulling away from him ) Do you want Mother to catch you here ? Do n't ! I 'll run around the house and get upstairs . ( She darts out the upper window and Lynn the lower . After a moment Mother opens the hall door and comes in  --  turning on the lights . She hesitates , is about to go back into the hall when Bobby comes in quickly through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got seventeen dollars ? I need it quick . MOTHER No . Why ? BOBBY I ran into a fellow and smashed his fender . He 'll settle for that and keep quiet and I can get ' em at the garage to fix our car tonight  --  if you 'll keep Dad from wanting it . MOTHER Oh Bobby  --  again ! This is awful . BOBBY It 's hell . Have you got the seventeen ? MOTHER I do n't know . I do n't think so . BOBBY Go see  --  please , Ma , and it 'll be all right . The fellow 's waitin ' ' round the corner . MOTHER But I do n't believe  --  FATHER ( Coming in through the window ) Bobby , a fellow out at the gate asked me if you 'd just come in here . What does he want ? ( Robert Hollister is fifty  --  a solid successful man with a very agreeable manner when he is agreeable , and a man who , not so successful and sure , might have been a very delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's got a car out there he wants to show me. p. 43 FATHER Indeed ! That will be profitable to him . BOBBY Well  --  I guess I can look at it  --  ca n't I ? FATHER ( Going to the desk , where he sits turning on the light and opening his paper ) I guess you can . Why do n't you go out and look ? You ca n't see it in here , can you ? BOBBY I 'm going . ( He looks expressively at Mother and she starts to the door as Granny comes in . ) GRANNY ( Her pride and her feathers still somewhat ruffled ) Is that child in here ? Because if she is , I wo n't come in a step . FATHER What 's the matter with you , Granny ? GRANNY ( Sitting on the sofa ) A good deal . I want to talk to you , Robert . MOTHER A  --  do n't talk to him now , Mother . GRANNY Why not ? Ca n't I even talk when I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobby who nods frantically for her to go. ) p. 44 MOTHER Robert 's tired now . Wait till after dinner . FATHER Let 's get it over with now  --  whatever it is . I 'd like to rest after dinner . I want a long ride . Bobby , you get the car out and have it here so I wo n't lose any time . We 'll all go for a long ride in the country . BOBBY Yes , Father . MOTHER Oh  --  that 's too bad , Robert . FATHER What 's too bad ? MOTHER I promised the car to someone else this evening . FATHER You did ? And what in the name of common sense did you do that for when you know it 's the only recreation I have ? The only way I can cool off and get a good night 's sleep . MOTHER But it 's for a poor sick woman who has no way of getting out . FATHER She has n't ? Well , I have n't either . I 'd be a poor sick man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't seem to have thought of that . Is the poor sick woman going to drive my car herself ? MOTHER No  --  Bobby 's going to take her . FATHER Then take her for half an hour , Bobby , and be back here sharp  --  understand ? p. 45 BOBBY Yes , Father . ( Mother starts to the door again . Granny snivels . ) FATHER Now , Granny , what is it ? Out with it . GRANNY She  --  MOTHER Bobby , bring me a handkerchief out of my top bureau drawer  --  in the box in the right hand corner . You know , you can get it . ( Bobby suddenly understanding starts to the hall door . ) FATHER How about that fellow waiting out there ? BOBBY I 'll see him as soon as I get Mother 's handkerchief . FATHER ( To Granny ) Has Mary been doing something to upset you again ? GRANNY She  --  MOTHER Oh , she did n't mean to , Mother . She did n't mean to hurt your feelings . GRANNY Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think Robert ought to know things and I think it 's my duty to tell him . You 're so slack yourself . Mary 's very slack , Robert . FATHER What have you been slack about now , Mary ? p. 46 MOTHER Mother does n't realize that girls ca n't be just the way they were when she was a girl . GRANNY Fiddlesticks ! Right and wrong have n't changed a bit and no amount of angling and twisting and dodging can get away from facts . FATHER Well  --  well  --  what are the facts in this case ? Come to the point . GRANNY Mary 's got  --  MOTHER Please , do n't talk about it now . I 'll tell Father at the right time . GRANNY The right time ! The right time is now this minute , before any harm 's done .

It 's enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , too . What is it ? Now you first , Mary . Wait , Mother . GRANNY Oh yes , I can wait . I 'm used to that . MOTHER It 's only a very foolish idea Mary has in her head , and I know I can get it out if I go at it in the right way  --  without making a row about it . GRANNY That 's what you always say , Mary ,  --  and it do n't very often succeed , so far as I can see . This time it 's too serious to fool with . It 's got to be nipped in the bud . p. 47 FATHER There 's a good deal in what your mother says , you know , Mary . You are pretty soft and undecided . That 's your besetting sin . MOTHER If anybody 's hard with her now it will be serious . It 's got to be handled very carefully . She believes she 's right with all her  --  GRANNY Shucks ! She does n't anything of the kind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must avoid the danger and  --  FATHER Now see here Mary . Tell me what it is and I 'll settle it without any squeamish nonsense .

FATHER ( Looking at Mother ) Well  --  MOTHER It 's already settled . FATHER Un ? MOTHER It 's all right . She wo n't do it . FATHER Wo n't do what ? GRANNY How do you know she wo n't ? MOTHER Because I know . I trust her . p. 48 MARY THE THIRD ( Coming in quickly from the hall ) Mother , will you hook me , please ? ( She wears a charming evening gown  --  very simple . Her lovely young body is free and somewhat exposed . An evening cape is thrown over her arm ) MARY THE THIRD Hello , Father . FATHER Hello , daughter .

You 've got a good mind if you 'd just use it  --  instead of throwing it away . MARY THE THIRD What makes you think I 'm throwing it away ? FATHER I would n't have to think much to see that . MARY THE THIRD I think you have a perfectly corking mind , Father  --  but you do n't always use it the way I think you ought to . FATHER And what 's this I hear about some new idea you have in your head ? MOTHER Robert  --  please ! ( Father shrugs his shoulders and goes back to his paper. ) p. 49 MARY THE THIRD Mother , your hands are shaking . Ca n't you find the hooks ? GRANNY I do n't know why she could n't . There 's nothing to the whole dress but the hooks . MARY THE THIRD Are you still cross at me , Granny ? I 'm awfully sorry . I 'll be good . GRANNY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good in that dress . MARY THE THIRD What 's the matter with this dress ? It 's a love . Is n't it , Mother ? MOTHER It 's very pretty , dear . GRANNY Yes , you uphold her in her nakedness , instead of making her put on clothes enough . MARY THE THIRD Oh Granny ! GRANNY I 'll wager you have n't got a sign of a petticoat on . MARY THE THIRD Of course I have n't . FATHER ( Looking over his paper ) What 's the reason you have n't ? MARY THE THIRD Heavens  --  nobody wears a petticoat , Father . GRANNY I do . Look at her . She might just as well be stark naked for all the good her clothes are doing her . p. 50 MARY THE THIRD You need n't talk , Granny .

FATHER I do n't want it to be so late as it was last night , mind you . Understand ? MARY THE THIRD Yes Father . FATHER And listen to me  --  if you 've got any new kind of daredevil recklessness in your head , you get it out or you 'll reckon with me . Understand ? MARY THE THIRD Yes Father . p. 51 GRANNY Are n't you going to put anything over your head ? MARY THE THIRD Goodness no , Granny . It 's roasting . GRANNY Mary , are you going to let her go out in the night air without putting anything on her head ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Do you hear ? MARY THE THIRD I have n't anything to put . MOTHER ( Snatching up the scarf Granny was knitting ) Here , dear . GRANNY My fascinator ! You 'll ravel it all out . MOTHER I 'll fasten it , Mother . It wo n't hurt it a bit . Good night , dear . GRANNY How do you know she wo n't take it off the minute she 's out of sight ? MOTHER ( Holding Mary ) Because I trust her  --  always  --  anywhere . MARY THE THIRD Good night , Mother dear .

FATHER What about the fellow 's car ? What did you think of it ? BOBBY Oh  --  I did n't think much of it . FATHER ( Still looking over the paper ) I got the repair bills today on my car and by Jove if they are n't cut in two this next month , I 'll sell the damn thing . I never saw anything like it . p. 53 BOBBY Well , I do n't make the bills , Father . FATHER Oh no . The car just walks out and gets itself out of commission . I 'll sell it I tell you . I 'm not made of money , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary . Something 's got to be done . GRANNY Well , I do n't run up the bills . I 'm a very little eater if you mean me , Robert .

GRANNY You 're not as careful a housekeeper as I was , Mary . MOTHER No  --  and eggs are n't ten cents a dozen now , either . FATHER We 've got to cut down . That 's all there is about it . BOBBY That 's what you always say the first day of the month , Dad . FATHER The whole country 's going to collapse if we do n't look out  --  with this reckless extravagance . Everybody 's living beyond their income  --  everybody . Same wild looseness there is in every other direction . There 's a general lowering of standards and ideals that is undermining society and civilization . p. 54 GRANNY That 's just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see it . She do n't see it creeping into her own children . FATHER Creeping in  --  striding in , you mean . GRANNY Yes , that 's it . MOTHER You ca n't expect your own children to be different from other people 's , you know . FATHER I do expect it , by Jove . If I had my way they would be . If I had my way they 'd all be at home this evening . GRANNY That 's what I say . It certainly is a lovely , lovely happy home , and they ought all to be in it . NORA ( A neat maid  --  opening the hall door ) Dinner is served . MOTHER There 's dinner and you two are n't ready . Run along , Bobby and get ready for dinner  --  and hurry . Why will you two always wait till dinner is on the table before you move ? Hurry , Bobby , hurry . ( Bobby rises and shambles out . ) Come Robert . FATHER It might wait a little for me . MOTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . You 've done it all your life and it 's terribly irritating . p. 55 FATHER ( Rising reluctantly ) I have to rush all day . I would like peace and relaxation at home . MOTHER Here 's your hat , Robert . FATHER ( As he goes into the hall ) I do n't want it . GRANNY ( Trotting after him ) We 're going to have chicken tonight , and I declare it is a shame we are n't all here to eat it . I do believe in a family all being ' round the table together when night comes .

I think we 're going right on up , through the sky , into the stars . HAL Yes , we may do that sooner than you think For Heaven 's sake , let up a little , Lynn . You 've lost your head . LYNN Not a bit ! She 's a good little wagon . This is easy for ' er . MARY THE THIRD Do n't spoil it , Hal . This is the way everything always ought to be  --  going with all we 've got and nobody saying " do n't . " Oh , are n't you glad we did it ? Do n't you know now we 're right , Lynn ? LYNN This part of it 's all right . HAL Of course we 're right . But let 's go slow enough to enjoy it . MARY THE THIRD But , Hal , I thought this was what you wanted , moving swiftly , alone , leaving the world behind . The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the unknown . p. 58 HAL This is n't spiritual exaltation . This is just reckless foolhardiness . Not what I came for . LYNN Do you want us to let you out ? HAL Do n't be funny . MARY THE THIRD Buck up , Hal . You 're free ! For the first time in your life . HAL There goes my hat ! MARY THE THIRD Never mind . What 's a hat ? HAL You 're doing everything you can to queer the whole idea . LYNN I 'm taking you to the idea as fast as I can . Do you want to go back and get your hat ? MARY THE THIRD Shut up , boys ! This is glorious ! Does n't everything we 've left seem a thousand times worse and more ordinary and piffling than it ever did before ? Oh , there 's a rabbit ! Do n't hit him , Lynn . Oooo ! ( Screaming and hiding her face against Hal ) LYNN Look out , boy ! Whew ! Never touched him . HAL Stop it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be afraid of . MARY THE THIRD He ca n't help it . Shut your eyes , Hal , and put your head on my shoulder . p. 59 LYNN Here , here , none of that . Where 's your nerve , Hal ? MARY THE THIRD He 's got a great deal more nerve about some things than you have . Gee , if you were both mixed up together into one man you 'd be pretty good . See the stars . We are going up  --  up  --  right into them . This is life ! Go on , Lynn ! Step on her ! ( Lynn bends lower over the wheel with a set face . Hal is holding on , sick with fear . Mary sits between them , her head thrown back , ecstatically happy . ) CURTAIN p. 60 Act 2 , Scene 2 ACT II SCENE II Time : 4 o'clock the next morning . Place : The living room again . At Curtain : The light of early morning comes through the windows . After a moment five figures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower window . Hal opens it cautiously and comes in quickly , carrying Mary 's suit case which he puts on the floor above the chair at left C. Lynn carries Mary in . Letitia and Max follow . Letitia is a pretty girl of the flapper type . She wears Max 's top coat over her evening gown and his cap on her bobbed hair . Max is a rather flamboyant and good-looking youth . The three boys are in evening clothes . HAL Put her over here , Lynn . ( Lynn puts the limp Mary in the arm chair at the left . The others come close , bending over her . ) LETTIE ( Kneeling beside Mary ) How are you now , honey ? HAL Do n't try to talk , Mary . How do you feel ? LETTIE Thank goodness we got her home ! I never was so frightened in my life . I thought you were going to die , Peaches . HAL How is the pain now , dear ? Just as bad ? p. 61 LYNN Mary , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! LYNN Then I 'm going to call your mother . MARY THE THIRD No ! LETTIE Yes , we will . We must , honey . It 's perfectly awful to see you like this . MARY THE THIRD No ! LYNN Then how is the pain ? MARY THE THIRD ( Suddenly sitting up ) There never was a pain . THE OTHERS What ? MARY THE THIRD I did n't have a bit . THE OTHERS What ? LETTIE She 's out of her head . Do n't you know me , lamb ? It 's Tish . MARY THE THIRD I wanted to get you home . I knew I must do something desperate , so I had appendicitis . LETTIE You wanted to get me home ? MARY THE THIRD Yes . LETTIE After raising heaven and earth to get me to go ? Oh , she is out of her head . p. 62 HAL No , she is n't . She 's arrived at something important . Speak to us freely , Mary . We must be honest or it 's all futile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max . What do you mean , Mary ? MARY THE THIRD Sit down just a minute and I 'll tell you . Ssh ! LETTIE Oh do n't push me . ( There is a general commotion . ) MARY THE THIRD Do be quiet . Do n't wake anybody up  --  for heaven 's sake . I suddenly knew I 'd been all wrong  --  that the only thing to do was to get you back . LETTIE Do you mean it was all a joke ? LYNN Ssh ! LETTIE Did you never intend to  --  MARY THE THIRD No , no  --  no ! Listen ! Sit down , all of you  --  please . LETTIE Nobody wants to sit down . HAL ( Sitting on the floor near Mary ) Yes , we do . Yes , we do . Do n't be so emotional , Letitia . You have no mental poise at all . LETTIE No , and I do n't want any . I 'm sick of trying to act like a highbrow . I 'm not one . I 'm a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your human feelings long enough to see what Mary 's mental attitude is now . This reaction is very important . MAX ( Lying on the floor in front of the others ) What the devil 's it all about , anyway ? LYNN Well , listen  --  listen , and you may find out . LETTIE We listened enough while you were working us up to do it , Mary . I do n't want to listen while you unwork us again . MAX Come on , sweetie . Sit down . Do n't be peevish ! LETTIE I think it 's just too awful to come home in this perfectly flat way . ( Sitting with a flop ) HAL Wait , Lettie , till you find out how it is . This may be the beginning of something greater . I 'm sure it is , Mary . MAX Stop chewing the rag Lettie . LYNN Oh for heaven 's sake , be quiet . Go on , Mary . LETTIE Yes , do . We 're all sitting at your feet as usual  --  waiting for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE THIRD I did n't change my mind . It was something much bigger than that . p. 64 MAX Must have been colossal to make you turn turtle like this . ( They are all sitting on the floor in a circle about Mary . Each has lighted a cigarette . ) MARY THE THIRD The whole world and life and what it means suddenly flashed before me , and  --  LETTIE I thought that flashed before you long ago . I thought that was why we  --  LYNN Sh ! HAL Wait , Lettie , wait . MARY THE THIRD I knew that we were wrong . That we were destroying something  --  hurting something . LYNN You bet we were ! I 'm darned thankful we 're back . We 're well out of a nasty mess , let me tell you . MARY THE THIRD Oh , you do n't understand , Lynn . It is n't that at all . I mean that we were absolutely right in what we believed but we 've got to be big enough not to hurt other people with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARY THE THIRD I never wanted to do anything so much in my life , but I just suddenly saw it the way Mother and Father would  --  and knew how it would seem to them . p. 65 MAX You knew that in the first place , did n't you ? MARY THE THIRD No  --  not actually  --  in the real way . None of us thought of it from their side . HAL Oh Mary , their side does n't count . We know we 're thinking way beyond the general level of thought and if we do n't act on it we 're not advancing . ( He hits Letitia 's nose with a gesture . ) LETTIE Oh , Hal , my nose ! ( There is general noise and confusion . Mary hushes them . ) LYNN I do n't see any use advancing so far that everybody thinks you 're a lunatic . MARY THE THIRD But because we do see further than other people  --  we must be a  --  magnanimous . They ca n't help it  --  you know  --  these deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HAL Personally , I think parents are much overrated  --  and given entirely too much importance in the general scheme . Though I believe if my father had lived he would have been a great man . LYNN I suppose you 're very much like him . HAL They say so . ( The others laugh . ) We 're the next generation and the next generation must go on . We know that marriage as is  --  is a failure  --  a gigantic human failure  --  and we also know that it 's getting worse . p. 66 MAX You do n't have to do much profound thinking to know that . Look at our own crowd . Every damned one of ' em divorced or ought to be . What 's the use of being married at all ? LETTIE Yes  --  love  --  yes  --  but we 've said all that long ago and often . The discussion in hand at the moment is  --  was it a mistake for Mary to bring us back or not ? MARY THE THIRD The point is  --  we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Mother does anything she pleases  --  regardless of me . She 's been married twice now and it is n't at all impossible that she will be again . She wo n't hesitate to rip things up  --  in spite of the fact that I 've just got used to calling this one Father , and just got so  --  I sort of can stand him . I do n't see what I owe to them  --  and anyway , I do n't think they 'd suffer a darned bit no matter what became of me . HAL My mother is entirely sympathetic with our idea  --  of course . She knows Father would have left her sometime without a moment 's notice , if he had lived . He would n't have vulgarized it with a quarrel or a divorce . He was way in advance of his time . MAX My father and mother are so old school  --  it would do them good to get a shock . If I want to try out Lettie in a new way  --  it 's none of their business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out . Do n't forget that , my lamb . MAX ( Kissing her hand ) Excuse me darling . HAL If we never did anything except what our parents want us to do the world would n't move much . MARY THE THIRD Yes , but we 've got to begin all over again and make them understand , and tell them what we 're going to do . It was the sneaking away I could n't stand . LETTIE ( Getting up ) You certainly have put me in a sweet hole . I wrote a note and stuck it on Mother 's pin cushion . I 'm going to feel clever when they find me in bed in the morning in the same old way . MARY THE THIRD Oh Lettie , I am so sorry . LETTIE Oh do n't mind me . Come on , Max . I might as well marry you first . Why not ? You 've got more money than anybody I know . ( Going up toward the window dragging her coat after her ) MARY THE THIRD Oh Tish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't through yet  --  we 're just beginning . LETTIE I 'm afraid you 'll have a hard time inflating me again , Mary . I feel as though I had started off on wings and come back in a wheelbarrow . Are you coming or staying , Max ? p. 68 MAX You bet I 'm coming . ( He hurries to the window ) So long ! This is all right you know . Good luck , fellers  --  I 've got my girl . ( He goes after Letitia . ) LYNN Of course it 's all right . It 's turned out the best thing in the world . And you were a brick  --  a brick , Mary , to do it . MARY THE THIRD It is n't all right . I 've made it worse than ever  --  and nobody really understands what I meant at all . LYNN I do . HAL Have I ever misunderstood you , Mary ? But I do think you were weak , dear girl . I do think you let sentiment  --  pure sentiment run away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such good  --  individual thinking . LYNN Oh , cool off and let 's get down to solid rock . HAL Oh yes , solid rock ! That 's what we 're all chained to . I do n't expect you to feel this as I do , Lynn . You could n't . LYNN I hope not . HAL I 'm not going to pretend that I 'm not disappointed in you , Mary . But this is n't the end . You will do it yet  --  and in a still wider , fuller way . Anybody who 's got the idealism you have , ca n't go back to the sordid conventional old rut. p. 69 LYNN Start the car , old man , I 'll be right out . HAL Thanks . I 'll walk home . MARY THE THIRD Hal  --  you 're not angry with me ? HAL No  --  not angry , but hurt and horribly  --  horribly disappointed . You were thinking with distinction  --  and now you 've gone back to the ordinary level of the average girl . Of course I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's turned out the best thing in the world . I love you more than ever , Mary . And you love me  --  do n't you , dear ? MARY THE THIRD Do n't ask me now  --  please . I 'm just beginning to find out something . LYNN You need n't expect me to believe for a minute that you hauled us off on this wild goose chase and then hauled us back again , because you got afraid of public opinion , and hurting people  --  and that stuff . MARY THE THIRD You do n't  --  LYNN You say you had a sudden flash  --  well , it must have flashed on you which one of us you wanted to marry , and God knows it could n't have been Hal  --  I give you credit for that  --  so , in all modesty , it must have been me. p. 70 MARY THE THIRD I ca n't talk about it now . I want to think . The thing that brought me back is more important than that just now . LYNN Just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THIRD I will try to make you understand  --  sometime . LYNN I 'll stop on my way downtown in the morning . MARY THE THIRD Then hurry . I want to lock the window . LYNN Well tell me this . Even if you have n't found out yet , you want me  --  are n't you dead sure you do n't want Hal ? MARY THE THIRD Please go . LYNN But I want you and I want you harder than ever . Talk about going up into the stars ! I went up and I 'm still there and I 'm going to stay . When you sat there close to me  --  making me go faster  --  when your hair blew in my face  --  I did n't care whether we smashed into eternity or not . We were together  --  alone . MARY THE THIRD We were n't . Hal was there . LYNN Same thing . You were n't the only one who got a flash of what it all means . It was only you and me and space  --  that was life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living it  --  up there  --  in the stars . p. 71 MARY THE THIRD But we ca n't . It 's too high . LYNN Not with you . MARY THE THIRD We had to come down . LYNN Well , what of it ! When I think what you went out to find  --  and that you even let me go with you to try to find it  --  I  --  my head swims . I ca n't say it , Mary  --  but I know what you want  --  because I 've found it . I could n't wish anything more wonderful for you than for you to love someone the way I love you . MARY THE THIRD Oh Lynn ! I wanted to go on with you forever . I wanted to push Hal out of the way and go on and on  --  and never stop  --  with you . LYNN Mary ! MARY THE THIRD I wanted to get inside your coat  --  close to you  --  away from everything else in the world . LYNN And that 's right where you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid  --  of myself  --  of you  --  of everything . LYNN Dear ! MARY THE THIRD And then I wanted to come home  --  and now I do n't know what I want . We 've lost that wild sweet something . It 's gone and I 'm afraid it will never come back . p. 72 LYNN You wanted to come home because you knew that you loved me . All that wild stuff 's over . We do n't need it . I love you , and I 'm coming over the first thing in the morning , to tell your father and mother . MARY THE THIRD Oh  --  I s'pose you might as well . There 's nothing else to do . LYNN What 's the matter dear ? Are n't you happy ? MARY THE THIRD I was  --  out there . LYNN And you will be here . We 've got the star dust and we 're going to hold on to it  --  tight . MARY THE THIRD Do you think we can ? LYNN Certainly we can  --  nothing as great as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must n't let it , Lynn  --  we must n't let it . Go now  --  please . ( He holds her a moment  --  kisses her  --  and goes out quickly . Mary fastens the window  --  starts to the hall door and sees Bobby asleep on the couch . ) Bobby , what are you doing there ? ( She goes to the couch and shakes him . ) Bobby ! Wake up . I bet you 're just pretending to be asleep . I 'll bet you heard everything . Bobby  --  get up ! p. 73 BOBBY Un ? MARY THE THIRD What are you doing down here this time of night ? BOBBY ( Half waking ) I came down to unlock the window for you  --  and I want to give you a tip . MARY THE THIRD What about ? BOBBY They 're on the war path . You 've done it once too often . What the devil do you mean staying out so late ? A girl ca n't get away with stuff like that  --  chasing ' round all night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What 's the reason I ca n't come in when I please ? ( Sitting on the couch beside Bobby . ) BOBBY Because you ca n't . Dad 's foaming at the mouth . Gramma told him about your dope for goin ' campin ' . MARY THE THIRD She did n't ! BOBBY She did . MARY THE THIRD If Grandma could only hold her tongue once in a while ! BOBBY I wish she 'd let me hold it for her once in a while . I 'd pull it out . MARY THE THIRD What did Father say ? p. 74 BOBBY He 's going to send you away . MARY THE THIRD What ? Where ? BOBBY Oh  --  just away . ( Waving his arm ) Anywhere out of this pernicious town with its pernicious influences . MARY THE THIRD Lordie , does n't it make you tired ? BOBBY You were a chump if you thought you could get away with that . You never would have had the nerve to do it anyway . MARY THE THIRD We did it . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay . BOBBY When ? MARY THE THIRD Tonight . We went sixty miles an hour some of the time . It was marvelous . BOBBY You 're a queer nut , Mary . What in " h " did you get yourself into that kind of a  --  MARY THE THIRD Because I 'm tired of doing just what everybody else does because they think anything different is wrong . I came back for Mother and Father 's sake  --  but if they 're going to act up about it , I wish I 'd stayed . BOBBY Well , gosh  --  you ca n't blame them much . Your rep wo n't be worth two cents if it gets out . Dad hit the ceiling so hard he has n't come down yet . Honest , Mary , he is going to do something . Do n't let ' em know you did go . He 'll sizzle you . You 'll have to dope up some reason why you stayed out all night . p. 75 MARY THE THIRD I wo n't . Why should I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why ca n't they let me alone ? I do n't say anything to them about the things they do . BOBBY Would n't you like to , though ? MARY THE THIRD Would n't I ? Just to let go and tell ' em a few things . BOBBY I 'd like to shoot a few at Dad  --  square in the eye  --  what I like about him and what I do n't . MARY THE THIRD Exactly . BOBBY If I could just once let him know that I 'm on to him I could listen to his favorite remarks about my character with more equanimity . MARY THE THIRD I know . We 're always wrong . They never are . BOBBY And the worst of it is you ca n't tell ' em . MARY THE THIRD Tell ? You might as well try to tell God He 's wrong . BOBBY If Dad did n't take it as a matter of religion that I ought to give him the paper ! If once in a while , he 'd say " Here , Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about giving it to him . MARY THE THIRD Of course . And if I could only talk to Mother . I did try . I did try to make her see . She does n't know at all what I want and what I think and feel . I know a great deal more about life and what 's going on this minute than she does . They 've never done anything thrilling or had any fun themselves and they do n't expect anybody else to . p. 76 BOBBY ( With a chuckle ) Oh I do n't know . They must have been pretty devilish  --  buggy-ridin ' Sunday afternoons . MARY THE THIRD Yes  --  looking for wild flowers . Mother never had any beau but Father , I s'pose , and she just married him and settled down and there you are . Anything I do is wrong because they have n't done it . ( Giving Bobby a poke to make him move over and sitting closer to him ) Listen , Bobby . I came back for them . I wanted to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but just as I was the happiest and the surest I heard Mother say  --  " I trust you  --  always  --  anywhere "  --  and she stayed right there with me  --  nearer than she 's ever been before and I  --  well  --  I came back . BOBBY Darn good job you did too . I could have told you before you started your idea was bunk . MARY THE THIRD Oh of course it all seems silly to you . You are n't old enough to know what it means . BOBBY Slush ! I 'm eighteen  --  you 're only twenty . MARY THE THIRD Yes , but those two years make all the difference in the world . p. 77 BOBBY Ho  --  o  --  Do n't you fool yourself  --  I know a thing or two . Those fellows are big chumps if they were goin ' off to let you size them up like that and take your choice . MARY THE THIRD Well  --  anyway  --  here I am  --  back  --  as Lettie says  --  in the same old flat way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Father somehow . They 're narrow and old-fashioned , but they 're good . BOBBY Yea  --  they 're all right  --  even if they do scrap sometimes . MARY THE THIRD Sometimes I 'm sort of worried about them . BOBBY I know . Sometimes it 's rotten . MARY THE THIRD But home and the family and you and me are the most important things in the world to them . After all we 're awfully lucky to have such parents . Lots of them are running around on the loose , you know . BOBBY You bet your sweet life they are ! MARY THE THIRD And a really , truly home like ours is wonderful  --  and I just could n't do anything to hurt it . They 're good and they love us , and they do love each other . I guess I will just sneak upstairs and tell one more lie to keep them happy . Do n't you ever really peep that I really did go . Do n't  --  for their sakes , old man . p. 78 BOBBY I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She takes up her suitcase . ) St ! They 're coming !  --  Beat it ! ( Mary starts to the hall door . ) Look out ! You ca n't do that .  --  You 're caught . ( Mary drops the suitcase . Bobby turns out the light and rolls under the sofa . Mother comes in quickly from the hall  --  runs to the lower window and peers out . She wears a negligee  --  her hair disordered . ) FATHER ( From the hall ) Are they there ? MOTHER No . FATHER ( Coming in  --  in bath robe and slippers ) I told you so . He 's gone after her then . They 're in cahoots . He knew all the time where she was . MOTHER I hope so . FATHER You do ? You hope he lied to me steadily for hours ? MOTHER Yes  --  if he knew where she is . FATHER ( He paces about restlessly irritable with apprehension ) There you are . No wonder they lie . MOTHER They do n't lie . p. 79 FATHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , they do n't . FATHER No they do n't . They just go on deceiving you and getting away with it because you shut your eyes to it . MOTHER You would n't telephone any place again , would you ? FATHER What good would that do ? We 've tried every place . Lettie 's gone . Those good-for-nothing boys are gone . Of course that 's what it means . She 's bolted ,  --  right under your nose . MOTHER I wo n't believe it . She could n't . She would n't do it without telling me . FATHER Telling you ? She did tell you . MOTHER She only said she was thinking about it . She was honest enough to tell me that  --  and I could have persuaded  --  FATHER Honest your foot ! She 's fooled you  --  deceived you . She does all the time . MOTHER ( Coming away from the window ) Do you think Bobby has gone after her ? FATHER He must have . He must have gone . . . to warn her that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he 's gone to tell her that and bring her back . p. 80 MOTHER Listen ! I thought the ' phone was going to ring . FATHER I tell you I 'm going to change things . I 'm through . I wo n't be made a fool of by my own children . What 's the matter with ' em ? Where do they get it anyway ? I sometimes think it 's something in you they get their looseness from , Mary . MOTHER I expect it is . FATHER ( His voice rising ) I do n't believe you try . You 're not firm enough . If you 'd kept at it  --  day in and day out , since they were born  --  impressing the principles of  --  MOTHER Do n't yell so ! I 'm not deaf . You 'll raise the neighbors . FATHER I 'll raise the roof . I 'll raise heaven and earth . I wo n't have such children . What do you teach them  --  anyway ? MOTHER ( Going back to the window ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make ? I want to know where she is . FATHER She 's gone . That 's what she is . She 's disgraced us . MOTHER I do n't believe it . FATHER No  --  you never face facts . That 's what 's put us where we are . She 's gone off just the way she told you she was going to . p. 81 MOTHER Try to get Lettie 's house once more . FATHER No use getting that maid out of bed again . She 's told us fifteen times now there 's nobody at home . Of course that blatherskite of a Lettie  --  has chosen a time to go off when her mother and father are away  --  but yours did it right before your eyes . MOTHER ( Going back to her chair again ) Do n't keep on saying that . Do something . FATHER Why did n't you do something at the right time ? Why in the name of heaven have n't you controlled her ? MOTHER Because I do n't know how . FATHER Why do n't you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you run your house and your children as well as I run my office ? Good Lord , she 's only a young girl . You 're more than twice her age . Why ca n't you manage her ? MOTHER You 're more than three times Bobby 's age . Why do n't you manage him ? FATHER I do . MOTHER No , you do n't . FATHER Besides , he 's a boy . He 's got to have experience . It would n't hurt him to go off on a spurt like this . p. 82 MOTHER It would . It would . I could n't bear it . FATHER You undermine everything I say to him anyway  --  with your softness . I do n't know what 's the matter . It 's not my fault . What in the name of heaven is the matter ? Why have we got such rotten children ? ( He sinks into a chair  --  putting his head in his hands ) MOTHER ( After a pause ) We do n't know what kind of children we have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't know how to take care of them . We do n't come any place near it . FATHER Speak for yourself . Do n't blame me because you 've failed . MOTHER Of course you have n't  --  in any way . FATHER No  --  I do n't think I have . MOTHER You 're always right about everything . FATHER Well , what am I wrong about now ? Have n't I told you from the beginning all the things you 've let her do would  --  MOTHER Yes  --  yes  --  yes  --  you have ! p. 83 FATHER It 's because you have n't done what I wanted that  --  MOTHER You 're only thinking about what you want  --  and not about what 's right for them at all . FATHER Well , is this right ? This and everything that 's led up to it ? MOTHER No  --  but you would n't have made it any better by being hard and pig-headed . FATHER ( Getting up ) Have you made it any better by being so weak and sloppy you let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Beginning to cry with quiet heartbroken tears ) FATHER Oh no  --  no harm  --  just disgraced us . That 's all . MOTHER Poor child ! She was trying to find the unfindable thing  --  a perfect love . I went through it myself floundering around in the dark  --  trying to choose . FATHER I think you did pretty well for yourself  --  choosing . MOTHER Oh yes  --  it was wise choosing  --  FATHER You regret it  --  do you ? p. 84 MOTHER Do n't you ? FATHER If I do , I 've got the decency not to say so . MOTHER If you could have seen what we 'd be like in twenty-five years  --  would you have chosen me ? FATHER If you feel that way about it  --  whose fault is it ? MOTHER Or even ten . Did we have ten years that were worth anything ? FATHER Are you blaming me ? MOTHER At the end of five we were a failure  --  jogging along  --  letting out the worst side of ourselves for the other to live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have n't had one of these spells for years . MOTHER No  --  because I 've just about given up trying to tell the truth to you about anything . FATHER That 's so all right . You certainly are not any too keen about telling the truth . MOTHER Because you ca n't stand it . Your nature ca n't stand the truth . FATHER Oh do n't excuse your lies and deceit and weakness by my nature . p. 85 MOTHER Do n't think I would n't be glad to be honest  --  to honestly be myself . You think I 'm weak . Well , you could n't stand my strength . FATHER What ? MOTHER We ca n't speak the truth to each other . We have n't anything to speak it with . FATHER I 'm flabbergasted at you . You seem to have lost what sense you did have . You disappoint me terribly . MOTHER ( With a sudden outburst as her suffering gets beyond her control ) Of course I do . Do n't you think you disappoint me ? FATHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to . I ca n't count on you . You are n't there . Sometimes I think you are n't the woman I married at all . MOTHER And sometimes I think you 're a man I could n't have married . Sometimes I loathe everything you think and say and do . When you grind out that old stuff I could shriek . I ca n't breathe in the same room with you . The very sound of your voice drives me insane . When you tell me how right you are  --  I could strike you . FATHER Mary ! MOTHER Oh ! ( She screams as she suddenly sees the suitcase ) p. 86 FATHER My God  --  what 's the matter ? MOTHER Her suitcase ! That was n't here when I was in this room before . She is here . Mary  --  my darling  --  where are you ? ( She rushes out of the room . Father goes after her . After a pause Mary comes slowly from behind the curtain  --  stricken white and dumbfounded ) MARY THE THIRD Bobby ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THIRD How can they ever speak to each other again ! BOBBY D'know . MARY THE THIRD I did n't know it was like this . And you can tell it 's been going on  --  sort of smothered . BOBBY It sure has busted out now . MARY THE THIRD It makes me  --  all gone  --  inside . BOBBY Nothing to hang on to . MARY THE THIRD Father and Mother ! I wish I had n't come back . BOBBY I 'd like to light out myself . MARY THE THIRD Our father and mother ! I ca n't believe it ! p. 87 BOBBY ( Going close to Mary ) We ca n't let ' em know we know . MARY THE THIRD How can we help it ? BOBBY I guess plenty of parents fight . MARY THE THIRD But ours ! I always thought they were so good ! Oh Bobby ! ( She drops her head on his shoulder and is shaken with sobs ) MOTHER ( Calling from the hall ) Mary  --  Mary  --  where are you ? ( Rushing back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where have you been ? What have you been doing ? FATHER ( Having come in after Mother ) Now young lady ! This is the last time ! Where have you been ? What have you been doing ? MARY THE THIRD Nothing wrong . MOTHER How could you ? Do you know what time it is ? FATHER It 's morning . That 's what time it is  --  and you 've been out all night . This is the last time you 're going to do a thing like this . And I know your new idea  --  what you were planning to do . p. 88 MOTHER Robert  --  wait . FATHER I almost thought you 'd done it tonight . If you 're reckless enough to have wanted to do it at all  --  I almost thought maybe you 'd started off tonight . MARY THE THIRD I did . FATHER What ? MOTHER Oh no  --  Mary  --  you did n't . You did n't do that . FATHER You what ? MARY THE THIRD I  --  went  --  tonight  --  all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOTHER Mary  --  MARY THE THIRD And then we came back . MOTHER You do n't mean you went to stay ? You did n't expect to do that ? MARY THE THIRD Yes I did . FATHER I 'm not surprised . This is the end . You 've gone too far . I 'm going to send you away . MOTHER Oh Robert  --  no you 're not . Wait ! FATHER Why should I wait ? I 've waited too long . I 'm going to send you where you 'll live a decent normal life till you come to your senses . The thing you planned to do is a brazen outrage . p. 89 MOTHER She did n't do it . She came home . FATHER Much home means to her ! You 've abused it all  --  everything your Mother and I have taught you to respect and hold sacred  --  thrown it away . Why you came back at all I do n't see . MARY THE THIRD I came back for a very silly reason . FATHER I 'll bet you did  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No  --  not a bit . MOTHER My dearest  --  do n't say that . You came back because you love us . MARY THE THIRD ( Breaking a little but controlling herself quickly ) Yes  --  I did , Mother . MOTHER Because you were sorry and did n't want to hurt us . FATHER Hurt us ! You 've wounded us so we 'll never get over it . You 've destroyed everything your Mother and I have held up to you as right  --  all our standards  --  the sanctity of the home . MARY THE THIRD Oh rot , Father . MOTHER Mary ! Stop it ! You 're out of your senses . p. 90 MARY THE THIRD I came home for that and found it was a joke . FATHER What do you mean ? MARY THE THIRD We heard you  --  Bobby and I. We were here in this room . FATHER Heard us what ? MARY THE THIRD Heard you say things to each other that makes everything you 're talking about now disgusting . MOTHER Oh , my child ! FATHER You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You heard us say how pained we are . MARY THE THIRD We heard you fight . MOTHER Mary  --  do n't  --  do n't ! You do n't understand , dear child . Your Father and I were only excited . I honor and respect your father above everything on earth . FATHER Your Mother and I have had a lifetime of devotion  --  with the highest ideals of married life . We did n't think we 'd live to see our own children desecrate all that we 've lived for . MARY THE THIRD Oh do n't ! We heard . We know . You told each other the truth . What 's the good of trying to plaster it over for us ? p. 91 FATHER There 's nothing left . This is the result of the wild life you 've been leading . BOBBY Why do you keep going on about her ? It 's you two that have smashed everything up . FATHER Stop ! She 's disgraced us . BOBBY She 's not the one that 's done the disgracin ' . MARY THE THIRD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold up our heads again . MOTHER Do n't child  --  do n't . MARY THE THIRD What 's the use of anything when everything we ever thought and believed about you is n't true ? BOBBY We know we 're rotten  --  plenty of times  --  but we always thought you were  --  MARY THE THIRD We always thought you were good . FATHER How dare you ? Is nothing sacred to you ? MARY THE THIRD A lot of things used to be . We always thought there was something between you and Mother , sort of holy  --  and different  --  that most people did n't have at all . How do you s'pose we feel when we know that it is n't so ? I do n't see that it makes much difference what we do  --  anyway  --  when everything 's all wrong with you . ( She goes swiftly out of the room as her sobs begin to come . Father turns away to the window . Mother sits helpless and dazed . Bobby lowers his head  --  ashamed to look at either one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . The dining room . The same curtains are used for the walls  --  with the same doors and windows placed in a different arrangement . The table is set for breakfast . Father sits at the Right , holding the newspaper so that it completely hides him from Mother who sits opposite , trying to drink her coffee , and making a pretense of reading a few letters . MOTHER ( Forcing herself to speak ) We must make them know it was never  --  quite so bad before . FATHER Oh , I guess they 've come to their senses by this time . MOTHER No matter how you feel towards me , make them think  --  FATHER I do n't know that it makes much difference what they think . MOTHER It 's the only thing that does make much difference . FATHER The point is , what are we going to do with her . And I 've made up my mind . MOTHER To what ? What are you going to do ? ( A pause ) You would n't do anything without telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small platter of scrambled eggs . She puts the platter on the serving table. ) p. 94 FATHER Thank you , Nora . ( Nora looks from one to the other  --  scenting something wrong  --  removes the fruit plates and serves the eggs . Mr. Hollister takes some , Mrs. Hollister refuses , Nora goes out . ) MOTHER You would n't do anything without telling me ? FATHER What good will it do to tell you ? MOTHER But you ca n't  --  FATHER You did n't tell me . And it 's because you did n't that this whole thing has come about . You 've shown you have n't the strength and decision to compete with your children . There 's nothing left but for me to take hold and  --  MOTHER Be careful . ( Granny enters from the hall cheerful and chipper . She wears an agreeable little lavender frock and a pink fluffy shoulder shawl ) GRANNY Good morning . MOTHER Good morning , Mother . GRANNY I said good morning , Robert . FATHER ( From behind the paper ) Oh  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cheerful fussiness ) The paper must be even more entertaining than usual . Did n't I get any letters , Mary ? MOTHER No  --  nothing . GRANNY Who are yours from ? MOTHER Oh nobody in particular . GRANNY They must be from somebody . Pass me the sugar , Robert , please . Is n't there anything you want me to read , Mary ? MOTHER Oh  --  here 's one from Cousin Maria . GRANNY Funny she did n't write it to me . She owes me one . Sugar  --  sugar , Robert . ( Poking Robert 's arm , then opening the letter ) I do n't see why Maria will use this paper . I 've told her twice I do n't like it . ( Robert passes the sugar to Granny ) Thank you , Robert . ( Patting his hand and smiling at him in her most irresistible way ) Feel a little grumpy this morning ? Did n't sleep well , I expect . Mary , are you going to give me any coffee or not ? Is your coffee all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I believe in petting a man a little in the morning till he gets the creaks out , and sort of warmed up . I 'm always sorry for a man when he has to leave his comfortable home and start off for the day . Goodness ! Maria 's writing gets worse and worse . I ca n't read a word she says . Read it to me , Mary . p. 96 MOTHER I will after breakfast , Mother . GRANNY You are n't eating a thing . At least you do come down to the table . I 'm glad you 're not like the lazy women who lie in bed and have their own breakfasts and let their husbands come down to the table . I think breakfast is the nicest meal of the day and the time people ought to be the cheeriest . Where are the children ? You certainly do let them lag behind , Mary . MOTHER They were up late . I 'm letting them sleep . GRANNY It would n't hurt them to come and see their father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round him before he starts off for the day . Does Maria say anything about coming ? MOTHER Um  --  sort of a hint . GRANNY Well , just do n't you take it . I love Maria dearly , but I ca n't stand her in the same house . There 's nothing she has n't got her nose in  --  ( Nora enters ) just boss , boss , boss . Maria 's got money . Let her stay at home and spend it . Do n't you say so , Robert ? Do put down that old paper , Robbie , and eat your breakfast . What 's the news ? FATHER Oh  --  nothing . GRANNY I never saw a man in my life who found any news in the paper after having his head stuck in it for a week . ( Nora serves the eggs to Granny . ) Oh ! Scrambled eggs again ! I wonder if she stirred cream in these ? Did you tell Lizzie what I said , Nora ? p. 97 NORA Yes m'am . GRANNY What did she say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the only way they 're fit to eat . ( Nora goes out ) See how tough these are ? ( She takes a bite of egg complacently and looks from Mother to Father . ) What is the matter ? What 's the matter , Mary ? MOTHER Why nothing , Mother . GRANNY You two had a tiff ? What if you have ? This is another day . You have to begin all over again . FATHER It looks like rain . GRANNY Does it ? ( A pause ) FATHER We need rain . The country needs it badly . GRANNY Yes , I s'pose it does . FATHER ( After another pause ) It 's been the driest spell we 've had for some time . GRANNY ( With a chuckle ) Robert 's doing pretty well , Mary . You might say something . p. 98 MOTHER I have a headache , Mother . I ca n't talk . ( Nora enters , with more eggs and toast ) GRANNY If I 'd stopped talking to your father every time I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hope you two have n't quarreled over Mary . You have to stand together to control her . That 's the only way you 'll ever  --  ( Mary comes in from the hall  --  solemnly followed by Bobby ) MOTHER Good morning , dear . Good morning , Bobby . BOBBY AND MARY Good morning . GRANNY Good morning . Good morning . Good morning . ( They seat themselves ) Are n't you going to kiss me good morning ? MARY THE THIRD Do you want me to ? GRANNY No  --  I do n't especially want you to  --  but I think you ought to . MARY THE THIRD I do n't see why . GRANNY I 'm not so anxious to be kissed , young lady  --  but I believe in keeping up appearances . MARY THE THIRD I do n't . GRANNY Um  --  you 'll get over that  --  the longer you live . p. 99 MOTHER Eat your breakfast , dear . ( As Nora serves the eggs again ) MARY THE THIRD No thank you , Nora . MOTHER Oh  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FATHER No thank you , Nora . ( Bobby falls upon his breakfast eagerly . Mother pours two cups of coffee . Nora serves the coffee to Mary and Bobby , and goes out . ) GRANNY You 're all awfully silly . I do n't know why you ca n't go on eating , just because there was a little  --  discussion last night . You need n't be nifty at me , Missy , because I told your father . I did it for your own good . MARY THE THIRD Oh , that 's a very small thing , Granny . Forget it . GRANNY Then what is the matter ? Why ca n't you start off the day like a happy family ought to ? MARY THE THIRD Because we 're not a happy family . MOTHER Mary  --  GRANNY Then why do n't somebody tell me what 's the matter ? MARY THE THIRD I should think you 'd know . p. 100 FATHER That will do . We wo n't discuss it now . But I 've come to a decision . MARY THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to send you where you will learn the important things of life and learn to conform to the opinions of those who know . MARY THE THIRD Where am I to learn that ? FATHER At a school I know of  --  a very fine one . MARY THE THIRD And are you and Mother going on in the same way ? FATHER What do you mean ? MARY THE THIRD I 'm perfectly willing to go away to school or any old place if it will help . Bobby and I talked it all over . If you and Mother want a divorce , we 'll see you through . GRANNY She 's out of her senses . FATHER Do n't put me and your Mother in the same class with the rotten set you 've been running with . We do n't tear up the ties of a lifetime just because we 've had  --  a  --  hard places  --  sometimes . MARY THE THIRD Do you mean you 've patched it up ? We wo n't let you . p. 101 FATHER Stop I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick together and hate each other ? MOTHER You have a wrong impression . We were only wrought up over  --  ( Bobby starts to leave the table . ) MARY THE THIRD Bobby , for heaven 's sake , speak up . Tell them what you think . FATHER ( Shouting at Bobby ) Are you a part of this rubbish ? BOBBY I know how you feel , Dad . I used to feel that way about it myself . But I changed my mind last night  --  after I saw how things are . We 'll buck up and do anything  --  so long as it 's got to be . Do n't mind us . FATHER This is insufferable . MARY THE THIRD Go on , Bobby . GRANNY I ca n't stand it ! BOBBY There 's nothin ' the matter with a divorce  --  it 's the havin ' to have it that 's rotten  --  and when you do  --  why you just got-a . So let 's get at it and get done with it . FATHER You leave the room . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make you see straight . I ca n't say anything more now . p. 102 MOTHER ( Shaking her head at Nora who starts in from the pantry ) No  --  Nora . Do n't come in at all . ( Nora goes out . ) MARY THE THIRD I wo n't go away a step  --  to school or any place else  --  till you and Mother are settled . FATHER You 'll do as I say . MARY THE THIRD And leave Mother wretched like this ? FATHER Your mother is not wretched . MARY THE THIRD Yes , she is , and so are you , Father . FATHER I 'm not . MARY THE THIRD Mother , do you want to go on living with Father or not ? ( Mother bursts into tears . ) FATHER You 've made her hysterical . She ca n't speak . GRANNY Well , I can ! Hold up your head , Mary , and tell us you 're a happy woman . ( To Mary the Third ) You ought to thank your lucky stars your father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not all skittles and beer , let me tell you  --  and you ought to be put to bed on bread and water till you get over this romantic notion of wanting to be happy every minute . p. 103 MOTHER You do n't understand , you children . Your father and I are sorry we quarreled last night , but you 're making too much of it entirely . Stop it . It 's over and ended . MARY THE THIRD You 're crawling out of it , Mother . Now 's your chance . We all know . You ca n't go back to the same old thing , because we do know . FATHER If reason wo n't control you something else will . You 've made it impossible for us to let you stay at home . You 've outraged everything that goes to make a home . MARY THE THIRD That 's what we think you 've done . BOBBY There is n't any home when you and Mother are like this . FATHER Do you set yourselves up against us ? MARY THE THIRD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say ? We 've told you we do n't want you to go on tryin ' to keep up the bluff for our sakes . And you surely do n't want to for yourselves . So what is there to it but to get together and quit ? We 're only tellin ' you that we want you and Mother to be happy , and go to it . ( He goes out of the room . ) FATHER If it comes to defiance  --  you 'll both go away . p. 104 MARY THE THIRD Very well . We 'll meet you half way . We 'll go if you and Mother get a divorce . FATHER I 'll settle you tonight . ( He goes out ) MARY THE THIRD Oh Mother , do n't cry . GRANNY What do you expect her to do ? It 's the awfullest thing I ever heard of any child doing to any parent  --  ever  --  anywhere . MARY THE THIRD Oh Lord , I do n't see anything to cry about . Let 's get some action . MOTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go away for a while , dear . Till we get over this . MARY THE THIRD Mother  --  do you actually mean you want to go on living with Father ? GRANNY Listen to her ! Who else would she live with ? MARY THE THIRD Granny , will you keep out of this  --  please ? I 'm trying to help Mother . MOTHER Oh , do n't you two quarrel . I ca n't stand any more . GRANNY We 're not quarreling . Come here , honey  --  come here . ( Drawing a chair out from the table and sitting ) Now listen , dearie . I know more in a minute about men than you and your mother put together . It wo n't be necessary for you or anybody else to go away  --  or upset our peace and comfort , if you 'll just use your wits . A little tact and wheedling goes further with a man than all the storming in the world . You can get anything on earth out of your father if you 'll just manage him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you 'll get your own way every time . p. 105 MARY THE THIRD I think that 's perfectly disgusting , Granny . GRANNY Now  --  now  --  do n't be saucy . I 'm trying to help you . MARY THE THIRD I do n't need to be helped . It 's Mother . GRANNY Well , the only way you can help her is to calm your father down . Rub him the right way till all this blows over . MARY THE THIRD Blows over ? If you do n't know how it is you ought to . They do n't love each other . Bobby and I found it out last night , and we ca n't stand this twaddle and mush about home and the family when we know Mother and Father ought not to even be in the same house . Is that the truth , Mother  --  or is n't it ? GRANNY It 's new-fangled nonsense . Modern selfishness . That 's what it is . A man and woman have no right to expect to be happy all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a good fight now and then to clear the air . Your grandfather and I had plenty . You women now-a-days do n't know how to manage men . That 's what 's the matter with you . Of course they get the best of you because you 're trying to make ' em think you know as much as they do , and they wo n't stand it . You 're such simpletons . You ought n't to let ' em ever see how smart you are . Why I had my way about everything on earth . The madder your grandfather got the more I cried and the softer I was . I just twisted him round my finger  --  like that . And he thought I was right under his thumb . p. 106 MARY THE THIRD Oh Granny  --  how can you ! Mother is n't Father 's mistress you know . GRANNY ( Putting her hands over her face ) Oh ! I never used that word in my life ! MARY THE THIRD It 's a perfectly good word . Mother and Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been a success  --  so the only thing for them to do is to start another kind of life entirely . Is n't that so , Mother ? GRANNY No , it 's not ! What would become of the rest of us ? MARY THE THIRD Us ? What have we got to do with it ? It 's their own inner closest life . It 's not right for them to live together . It 's not decent . It 's absolutely immoral . GRANNY I wo n't listen to such talk ! It 's Godless and heathenish ! ( Going to Mother . ) Mary , you come upstairs and I 'll help you . I can help you to bear anything you 've got to bear with Christian fortitude as a good and noble wife should . I never dreamed you were silly enough to let yourself be unhappy . Heaven knows , you 've got enough to be happy with  --  and if you 're as clever as you ought to be you 'll take the bit in your own teeth and he 'll come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth as smart as a woman if she just uses what God gave her  --  and there 's no young chit can teach me any tricks ! ( She goes out with her head well up , closing the door. ) p. 107 MARY THE THIRD Now Mother  --  let 's decide what to do . MOTHER Mary , you must stop this . You 're making a tragedy out of just a little hard place that your father and I have to get over in our own way . MARY THE THIRD Was there someone else you ought to have married  --  or just the ideal man of your dreams ? MOTHER Oh , we always like to think it might have been different with someone else  --  when we fail . I have failed  --  utterly . MARY THE THIRD ( Kneeling quickly by her Mother and throwing her arms about her ) I adore you Mother . I did n't know till last night how much I loved you . I 'm lots older than you are . Really I am . You 're just a little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOTHER I wish I were . MARY THE THIRD But still I am awfully sorry for Father . You do get on his nerves . He 's bored . Father 's bored to death with you , Mother . You 're disappointed and disillusioned in him  --  but I do think it 's more your fault than his . MOTHER Oh  --  Mary  --  Why ? MARY THE THIRD Women will have to change marriage  --  men never will . At least you 've come a long way ahead of Granny . Her marriage was on a very low plane , of course . You have n't stood up to Father and looked into his eyes  --  levelly  --  without conditions and silly compromise because he 's a man and you 're a woman . p. 108 MOTHER Go on . MARY THE THIRD The interesting side of you  --  as a person  --  you have n't given to Father at all . He said last night You do n't come through . You are n't there. He is there  --  in his way . There 's his side too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . MARY THE THIRD But you are going to stand up now and keep a stiff lip and come through with this . MOTHER I do n't see anything but blankness before me . And there 's Mother . She has to have a home . MARY THE THIRD ( Looking deeply at her mother ) You mean you have n't any money without Father ? That you and Granny are dependent on him ? ( Mother nods . ) All that is so horrible . . . so disreputable ! MOTHER Mary ! MARY THE THIRD It is ! It 's buying things with you . Do n't let it go on , Mother . We 'll fix it some way . I 'll help you . MOTHER I 'm not young . I ca n't go out and make my own living . MARY THE THIRD But you ought to be able to . That 's the point to the whole business . I shall have my own money . I 'll make it . I shall live with a man because I love him and only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care of myself and my children if necessary . Anything else gives the man a horrible advantage , of course . It makes the woman a kept woman . p. 109 MOTHER Oh you  --  MARY THE THIRD Why it does , Mother . The biggest , fairest , most chivalrous man on earth ca n't feel the same towards a woman who lives with him only because she has to be taken care of  --  as he does to one who lives with him because she loves him . Unless it 's love and only love  --  FATHER ( Coming back into the room ) I want to speak to your mother . ( After a slight pause Mary goes out . ) FATHER The boy 's hard hit . He 's taken this thing terribly seriously . We 've got to do something about it . MOTHER And the girl ? FATHER Oh  --  She 's excited  --  but he is actually suffering . As you say we 've got to make them see they 're mistaken . . . . MOTHER But are they ? FATHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MOTHER And you meant everything you said to me . FATHER We were all stirred up . MOTHER Yes  --  enough to speak the truth . p. 110 FATHER Well  --  what are you going to do ? Let them go on  --  thinking what they think ? MOTHER They 've made their own solution . FATHER You mean . . . ( She nods . ) You do n't think for a second we . . . ( A pause . ) We have n't done anything people get  --  divorces for , Mary . ( His voice growing a little hoarse . ) MOTHER We 've done the worst of all things . FATHER What ? MOTHER We have n't made it a success  --  and it might have been . FATHER Oh  --  we 've been careless . We need more self-control I s'pose . MOTHER Self-control is a poor substitute for love . FATHER It 's impossible to think of you and me  --  not together . It used to be all right . We 've got to go back and begin all over again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary  --  some of the nonsense that child spouted has got hold of you . Do n't let any of her silly . . . p. 111 MOTHER She is n't silly . She 's brutal because she 's so young  --  but she 's honest and  --  FATHER She 's the product of this damnable modern loose-thinking . MOTHER And she 's thinking nearer the truth than we ever did . She 's got something dangerous and ridiculous in one hand and something big and real in the other . FATHER Oh , you ca n't take her seriously ? MOTHER You say we must go back . Go back to what ? Our accidental love affair  --  when we did n't know each other at all ? We do know each other now . How can we go on after this ? I ca n't . FATHER What about me ? I 've got something to say about this  --  too  --  you know . I wo n't have my home broken up . Good God , Mary ! Nothing means anything to me but you and the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the veranda quickly ) Good morning . Good morning , Mrs. Hollister . I 'm glad you have n't gone yet , Mr. Hollister . I want to say to you both that I 've come back to my senses good and hard . Mary 's up in the clouds about the whole business but I 've come down with a thud and know where my feet are . I know the good old way is the only way  --  like you two did it . You did n't need any experiments to make you know you loved each other for good and all , did you ? You knew you 'd stick to the end , and be crazy about each other forever  --  did n't you ? And you 've proved it . And that 's what got Mary , you know . She sort of seemed to realize for the first time what marriage means , and she came back for your sakes . ( Mother and Father turn away ) Honest , I 'm not stringin ' you . I know you want to kick me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the good old way to say I 'd like to marry your daughter and ask your consent . I know I can make her happy  --  and I know we were meant for each other , and I know we 'll make a go of it the same way you have , and I hope you 'll back me up and help me to get her . ( He forces Mr. Hollister to give him his hand and shakes it vigorously and confidently ) p. 112 FATHER ( To Mother  --  trying to get his hand away while Lynn shakes it ) Bring Mary down here and let 's get at this thing . ( Mother goes out closing the door ) Has she promised to marry you ? LYNN Yes . Do n't you think I 'd make her a good husband , Mr. Hollister ? FATHER How do I know what kind of a husband you 'd make ? LYNN But with your experience , do n't you think if a girl marries a solid practical man who can take care of her  --  FATHER I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LYNN But if we 're  --  HAL ( Coming in from the veranda ) Good morning , Mr. Hollister . Hello , Lynn . LYNN Hello . HAL I was going in to your office this morning , Mr. Hollister , to see you . FATHER Indeed ! HAL I want you to know that I 'm sorry we did n't go through with it last night . FATHER Ah ! p. 113 HAL Because it looks like a failure , does n't change me in the least . FATHER That 's important . HAL I know we were right . LYNN Oh , cool off , Hal . It 's all over now and Mr. Hollister does n't care anything about what we think . HAL Excuse me  --  it is n't all over . And what I think is more important than ever . I want you to know , Mr. Hollister , that I love your daughter too much to marry her in the old blind accidental lottery that your marriage was . FATHER What ? HAL It was a lottery , was n't it ? Just good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have gone the other way for anything you really know about each other , might n't it ? You 've just had the luck of one in a thousand that you 've loved each other devotedly and continuously all these years  --  have n't you ? I 'm sure you 're a big enough man to acknowledge that . LYNN I think Mr. Hollister 's bored stiff with us , if you ask me . HAL I suppose he is . But you 've said your say , I 'll bet , and I want him to know  --  p. 114 FATHER I do n't want to know anything . HAL But it 's only fair to let me say that I 'll stand up for my convictions before the whole town , if necessary . I know that unless we change the entire attitude of men and women towards each other  --  there wo n't be any marriage in the future . Unless we open our eyes to what happiness and decency really are  --  unless we lift ourselves to another plane of thought entirely  --  FATHER Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know any more what you 're talking about than an unborn baby . Until you 've lived  --  until you 've gone through the mill  --  you do n't know yourself , let alone anybody else . You do n't know what kind of a fool you may be , or how you may ball things up . HAL That 's just why we ought not to marry till we know  --  FATHER It 's not the damned ideas that will get you anywhere  --  it 's yourself . If you 're ever lucky enough to have a woman love you , you take care of that one love  --  and do n't be so cocksure of yourselves . If you  --  ( Mary comes in from the hall ) Now see here , Mary , which one of these boys do you intend to marry ? MARY THE THIRD Neither . p. 115 FATHER You did n't start off on that outlandish idea last night without intending to marry one of them ? MARY THE THIRD I hoped it would be one of them , of course . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could n't have found that out by staying at home , I suppose , in a normal natural way ? MARY THE THIRD I admit I found out a great deal more about it after I got home than I could have any other way . HAL How , Mary ? FATHER Never mind that . You ca n't go as far as this with the most important thing in your life and drop it as if it was nothing at all . You ca n't go as far as this without having some indication as to which one of these boys you prefer . Now which one is it ? What are you hesitating about ? MARY THE THIRD I 'm not hesitating at all . I know now if I 'd gone off with each one of you alone for a year  --  we would n't have known each other . Now I know it takes most of one 's life to do that . HAL Then we were right . I ca n't talk to you here , Mary , before other people  --  but you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . p. 116 MARY THE THIRD ( Taking his hand quickly in both of hers ) Thank you , Hal . ( He goes out ) LYNN Mary , what 's changed you since last night ? What are you going to do ? MARY THE THIRD Father , listen ! This is what I 've just told Mother . When I got home I told Lynn I loved him  --  and I do . I love him so much I ca n't live without him . I was going to marry him  --  quick . But now I would n't marry him for anything on earth . FATHER Why not ? LYNN What do you mean ? MARY THE THIRD Marriage is a disgusting sordid business affair that I would n't go into for anything . LYNN Mary ! MARY THE THIRD But if you want me to , Lynn , I 'll live with you till we 're sure what we really mean to each other , and when we know we 'll either be married or quit . LYNN Good heavens , Mary ! You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of muck and filth you 've been thinking about ? LYNN Why you never even dreamed of such a thing . p. 117 MARY THE THIRD I did n't think I 'd actually do it , ' till I found out how horrible a perfectly good and respectable marriage can be . FATHER Have n't you any decency about anything ? MARY THE THIRD I 'm sorry , Dad , but Lynn 's got to know . He 's got to know why I wo n't marry him . It 's because of Father and Mother , Lynn . I do n't believe in marriage . BOBBY ( Coming in quickly ) I 've got Mother to say she 'll do it . ( He stops , seeing Lynn ) FATHER Do what ? LYNN Do you want me to go ? MARY THE THIRD Do n't go ' way . Wait on the porch . ( Lynn goes out onto the terrace ) FATHER ( To Bobby ) Do what ? BOBBY Leave you . FATHER You  --  ( He tries to speak but stops helplessly ) BOBBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going with her and take care of her , Father . You need n't worry about that part of it . But do n't spoil it now  --  will you ? Do n't say anything to make her lose her nerve . p. 118 MARY THE THIRD You wo n't will you , Father ? That 's splendid , Bobby . FATHER ( Broken and unbelievingly ) Your mother did n't tell you  --  she 'd leave me , did she ? BOBBY Yes , she did . ( Father goes slowly to the other end of the table and sits ) MARY THE THIRD You wo n't do anything to stop her  --  will you ? BOBBY I 'm thinking about you , Dad , just as much as I am about Mother . I know you want her to go . You just hate to come straight out and say so . Now 's your chance  --  do it . FATHER Are you children blaming me for the whole thing ? BOBBY AND MARY No ! ! ! MARY THE THIRD Of course not , Father ! BOBBY You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard livin ' with a woman . Imagine one man living all his life with Gra'ma . FATHER ( Getting hold of himself again and rising ) You 're acting like lunatics  --  both of you . If you 've made your mother think I want her to leave me  --  p. 119 BOBBY If I have ? I like that ! You mean if you have . FATHER You do n't know anything  --  you young whippersnapper . Your mother 's the finest woman in the world . I 'd lay down my life for her . Your poor dear mother ! ( Bobby and Mary look at each other  --  surprised and slightly disgusted at Father 's sudden sentiment . ) MARY THE THIRD For goodness sake , do n't get sentimental now Father  --  just as Mother 's getting some spine . BOBBY I think as much . I worked like the devil to get her to come to the point . FATHER ( Quite himself again ) Now see here . If you think for one minute anything you say is going to  --  ( Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary  --  you have n't let anything these children have said influence you ? BOBBY If you do n't do what you said you were going to Mother  --  I 'm going to clear out . I wo n't live here . MARY THE THIRD And you know what I 'm going to do , Mother . I 've told Father too . FATHER Be quiet  --  both of you . Now Mary dear  --  tell them there 's nothing in this nonsense . Tell them they 've kicked up a fuss over nothing and we 're going right on with our customary happy life . Assert yourself  --  and tell them they 're entirely mistaken . ( A pause ) Come  --  come  --  go on  --  dearest . ( Father tries to be sure of himself , and assumes a slightly affectionate gaiety . Mary and Bobby look at each other , half disgusted , half ready to laugh ) p. 120 MOTHER I 'm going away . FATHER You 're not . I wo n't have it . BOBBY Go on , Mother . FATHER Be quiet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think life is anyway ? Your mother and I have n't done anything to get a divorce for . BOBBY Of course you have n't beaten her or broken the eighth commandment  --  or any  --  MARY THE THIRD The seventh , Bobby . BOBBY Un ? Well  --  but what you have done is a thousand times rottener , and if you 're going to keep right on I 'm leavin ' . How about it Mother ? MOTHER They 're rebelling against the ugliness  --  and meaness  --  the cruelty and pettiness . They think it does n't have to be . They 're saying very foolish things  --  but they 're true  --  they 're true . I 'm going . BOBBY And I 'm goin ' with you . MOTHER No . I 'm going alone . It 's the only way we can find the truth about ourselves , Robert , or anything else . Where 's Lynn ? MARY THE THIRD Out there . MOTHER Call him in. p. 121 MARY THE THIRD ( Going to the window ) Lynn ! ( Lynn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you not to do what you say you 're going to  --  for I know I have n't given you anything better  --  but I ask you to wait . It is n't our marriage that was wrong  --  it 's what we 've done with it . LYNN I 'm not afraid , Mary  --  I 'll make you happy . MARY THE THIRD How do you know you will ? BOBBY That 's what . I thought the thing you were up to was all hot air and bunk  --  but I begin to believe there 's a good deal in it . I know one thing , by golly  --  I 'll never take a chance . I 'll never take a chance of being where you and Father are . If you two could n't make a go of it , I 'd like to know who can . I do n't see why men and women do n't stop tryin ' to live together  --  anyway . ( He starts to go ) MOTHER ( Stopping Bobby with her hand and going to the door ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we  --  ourselves and what we 've done  --  that are wrong . ( She goes out . Bobby follows . Father goes to the door ) p. 122 MARY THE THIRD ( Putting her hand on Father 's arm ) Let her go , Dad . Let her go . FATHER But I 'll bring her back . MARY THE THIRD Do you mean you love her ? FATHER You 've got an awful lot to learn , little girl . MARY THE THIRD ( Suddenly throwing her arms about his neck ) Make her love you , Dad . Make it all over . If you could ! If you could ! ( Father  --  too moved to speak holds her close for a moment and goes out  --  closing the door . ) LYNN ( Going down to Mary  --  after a pause ) Gosh , I 'm sorry . It 's the last thing in the world I would have expected to happen . MARY THE THIRD Why did n't they know in the first place ? Can anybody ever know ? ( Sitting in her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Sitting in Mother 's place at the table ) We were meant for each other . No man ever loved a girl the way I love you . MARY THE THIRD I bet that 's what Father said to Mother . I bet that 's what everybody says . It makes me sort of sick . p. 123 LYNN But we 're different . We know what we 've got . MARY THE THIRD How do we know we do ? What if the very things you like in me now  --  you 'd hate sometime . What if the things I think are strong and stunning in you now I 'd think were pig-headed and kickable after awhile ? LYNN How could we ? People could n't be better suited to each other than we are . MARY THE THIRD I suppose they thought that too . Twenty-five years Mother and Father have been looking at each other across the table . And most of that time they 've wished they were looking at somebody else . LYNN Oh Mary , you do n't  --  MARY THE THIRD If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tied to each other , or if Mother could have walked out and taken care of herself at any minute , they would have had to please each other in order to hold each other . LYNN I know . You 're dead right . But what if they had n't been married ? You and Bobby would n't have thanked them much for bringing you into the world without any name or anything to put your feet on . MARY THE THIRD I do n't see that they 've given us so darned much to put our feet on now . They 've smashed everything I ever believed about love and marriage . p. 124 LYNN Oh  --  your mother said it  --  there 's nothing the matter with marriage  --  it 's what people do with it . What 's the use trying to bust up the best thing we 've got ? Why do n't we begin to make marriage better instead of chucking it ? Why do n't we make it honest and decent and fair  --  and if we have made a mistake we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! LYNN You angel ! MARY THE THIRD Oh do n't ! I bet Grandfather called Granny an angel  --  and knelt at her feet while he was saying it . LYNN Well old pal  --  we 're going to be side by side  --  both on the same level  --  both on the square . MARY THE THIRD And just as free as though we were n't married at all . LYNN Absolutely . MARY THE THIRD No hold on each other but love . LYNN None . MARY THE THIRD And the minute that 's gone  --  we 're through . LYNN That 's the stuff . MARY THE THIRD Give me your hand on that old man . ( They clasp hands ) But Lynn , I would n't marry you if I did n't know that ours is the love that will last forever . There ca n't be any doubt about a love as great as ours , can there , dear ? p. 125 LYNN ( Drawing her onto his knees ) You bet there ca n't . MARY THE THIRD I do think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I adore the way your hair grows at the side , dearest . LYNN Your eyes are the most beautiful things in the world . They have in them everything I want . MARY THE THIRD ( Putting her arms about his neck ) I love you . LYNN I love you . MARY THE THIRD And we must make it the most wonderful love that was ever in the world . ( She kisses his lips ) THE CURTAIN FALLS ( END OF PLAY. )
