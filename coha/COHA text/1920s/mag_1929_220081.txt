Who should return to Paris , last fortnight , after a visit to the new Papal State , but beloved Louis Ernest Cardinal Dubois . When correspondents hastened to call upon the amiable and popular Archbishop of Paris , they found him in the best possible humor . He had just carried to Pope Pius XI , he said , a check for a half-million francs ( $19,500 ) . At first the Holy Father would not take it , but Cardinal Dubois gently proffered the sum a second time , and finally Pope Pius turned the check over to the Papal treasury , with instructions that it be used to relieve Catholic priests in Mexico , many of whom are homeless and impoverished due to the suppressive measures of Mexican President Emilio Fortes Gil ( TIME , March 4 et ante ) . <P> The money , said Cardinal Dubois , was a gift from the French clergy . They had derived it from the special contributions known as " Peter 's Pence . " What may be called the underlying theory of " Peter 's Pence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost by the Pope in 1870 , when the Papal lands and corresponding revenues were seized by the Italian State . Today , however , the State has promised , in the newly signed Italo-Papal treaty &; concordat ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) , to indemnify the Holy See for its losses of 1870 by a cash payment of $92,000,000 . Therefore the act of Pope Pius , last week , in despatching a half-million francs worth of " Peter 's Pence " to Mexico , seemed to augur that a new underlying theory of " Peter 's Pence " is being evolved by the prelates of the Papal State . <P> In discussing at Paris his recent audience with the Holy Father , Cardinal Dubois said : " He mentioned his joy in being able henceforth to travel about freely . Sooner or later the Pope , who claims world-wide spiritual dominion , will visit every part of the globe , America not excepted , of course . The imagination is staggered when one comes to think of what will happen when a Pope sets foot in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt it , although , personally , I am sure , he is willing enough . But the day will come . " <P> When strongly pressed to reveal the name of the first nation outside the continent of Europe on which Pope Pius XI will set foot , the Cardinal-Archbishop reflected for a moment , then answered cautiously , " perhaps Ireland .
