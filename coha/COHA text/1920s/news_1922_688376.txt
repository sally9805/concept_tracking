txt I have received a copy of your letter asking me to subscribe to a fund for a new college building . If I had my way I would burn all the women 's colleges in the country . The young women of our country do need to be educated , but the education they need is to leave off Smoking Cigarettes , stop using slang , Swaggering , give up their brazen manner , their paint powder , and their lipsticks high-heeled shoes and to dress indecently . Of all the fool things in the world I think the college for women is the worst . When they graduate from the colleges they can not write a decent hand . They knoW nothing about the English language . They can not spell . They are thoroughly ignorant of the things they should know , and they haVe their brains twisted by studying psychology , logic and philosophy and a lot of other stuff not only utterlyuseless but absolutely harmful  --  a lot of stuff which could have been concocted only in the diseased brains of college professors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men . But that day is largely passing away , and this is due more , perhaps , to the effect that the colleges are having on the college women than to anything else . Nothing could be better for the girls that are now in the colleges than to be token out of the colleges and put to hard manual labor for at least a year so that there : night be put into their heads some little trace of sense . ALONZO 13 . SEE . - The letter was made public last night by . Tames F. Herrick , who is handling publicity for the endowment drive . Mr. Herrick said he had Mr. See 's permission to give it out .
