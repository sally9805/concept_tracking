txt //orest which once extended its mysterious labyrinth from tide-water to the prairies when the earliest colonists entered warily its sea-worn edges a portion of the European race came again under a spell it had forgotten centuries before , the spell of that untamed nature which created primitive man . All the dim memories that lay deep in subconsciousness ; all the vague shadows hovering at the back of the civilized mind ; the sense of encompassing natural power , the need to struggle single-handed against it ; the danger lurking in the darkness of the forest ; the brilliant treachery of the forest sunshine glinted through leafy secrecies ; the Strange voices in its illimitable murmur ; the ghostly shimmer of its glades at night ; the lovely beauty of the great gold moon ; all the thousand wondering dreams that evolved the elder gods , Pan , Cybele , Thor ; all this waked again in the soul of the Anglo-Saxon penetrating the great forest . And it was intensified by the way he came ,  --  singly , or with but wife and child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful . And the surrounding presences were not only of the spiritual world . Human enemies who were soon as well armed as he , quicker of foot and eye , more perfectly noiseless in their tread even than the wild beasts of the shadowy coverts , the ruthless Indians whom he came to expel , these invisible presences were watching him , in a fierce silence he knew not whence . Like as not the first signs of that menace which was everywhere would be the hiss of the Indian arrow , or the crack of the Indian rifle , and sharp and sudden death . Under these conditions he learned much and forgot much . His deadly need made him both more and less individual than he had been , released him from the dictation of his fellows in daily life while it enforced relentlessly a uniform method of self-preservation . Though the unseen world became more and more real , the understanding of it faded . It became chiefly a matter of emotional perception , scarcely at all a matter of philosophy . The morals of the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together by a comradeship in peril . Courage , cautiousness , swiftness , endurance , faithfulness , secrecy ,  --  these were the forest virtues . Dreaming , companionship , humor ,  --  these were the forest luxuries . From the first , all sorts and conditions were ensnared by that silent land , where the trails they followed , their rifles in their hands , had been trodden hard generation after generation by the feet of the Indian warriors . The best and the worst of England went into that illimitable resolvent , lost themselves , found themselves , and issued from its shadows , or their children did , changed both for good and ill , Americans . Meanwhile the great forest , during two hundred years , was slowly vanishing . This parent of a new people gave its life to its offspring and passed away . In the early nineteenth century it had withered backward far from the coast ; had lost its identity all along the north end of the eastern mountains ; had frayed out toward the sunset into lingering tentacles , into broken minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a queer sort of natural selection , its people had congregated into life communities not all of one pattern . There were places as early as the beginning of the century where distinction had appeared . At other places life was as rude and rough as could be imagined . There were innumerable farms that were still mere " clearings , " walled by the forest . But there were other regions where for many a mile the timber had been hewn away , had given place to a ragged continuity of farmland . In such regions especially if the poorer elements of the forest , spiritually speaking , had drifted thither  --  the straggling villages which had appeared were but groups of log cabins huddled along a few neglected lanes . In central Kentucky , a poor new village was Elizabethtown , unkempt , chokingly dusty in the dry weather , with muddy streams instead of streets during the rains , a stench of pig-sties at the back of its cabins , but everywhere looking outward glimpses of a lovely meadow land . At Elizabethtown in 1806 lived Joseph Hanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor people they were , of the sort that had been sucked into the forest in their weakness , or had been pushed into it by a social pressure they could not resist ; not the sort that had grimly adventured its perils or gaily courted its lure . Their source was Virginia . They were of a thriftless , unstable class ; that vagrant peasantry which had drifted westward to avoid competition with slave labor . The niece , Nancy , has been reputed illegitimate . And though tradition derives her from the predatory amour of an aristocrat , there is nothing to sustain the tale except her own appearance . She had a bearing , a cast of feature , a tone , that seemed to hint at higher social origins than those of her Hanks relatives . She had a little schooling ; was of a pious and emotional turn of mind ; enjoyed those amazing " revivals " which now and then gave an outlet to the pent-up religiosity of the village ; and she was almost handsome. ( 1 ) History has preserved no clue why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose to marry an illiterate apprentice of her uncle 's , Thomas Lincoln , whose name in the forest was spelled " Linkhorn . " He was a shiftless fellow , never succeeding at anything , who could neither read nor write . At the time of his birth , twenty-eight years before , his parents  --  drifting , roaming people , struggling with poverty  --  were dwellers in the Virginia mountains . As a mere lad , he had shot an Indian  --  one of the few positive acts attributed to him  --  and his father had been killed by Indians . There was a " vague tradition " that his grandfather had been a Pennsylvania Quaker who had wandered southward through the forest mountains . The tradition angered him . Though he appears to have had little enough  --  at least in later years  --  of the fierce independence of the forest , he resented a Quaker ancestry as an insult . He had no suspicion that in after years the zeal of genealogists would track his descent until they had linked him with a lost member of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New Jersey , whose descendants became wanderers of the forest and sank speedily to the bottom of the social scale , retaining not the slightest memory of their New England origin. ( 2 ) Even in the worst of the forest villages , few couples started married life in less auspicious circumstances than did Nancy and Thomas . Their home in one of the alleys of Elizabethtown was a shanty fourteen feet square. ( 3 ) Very soon after marriage , shiftless Thomas gave up carpentering and took to farming . Land could be had almost anywhere for almost nothing those days , and Thomas got a farm on credit near where now stands Hodgenville . Today , it is a famous place , for there , February 12 , 1809 , Abraham Lincoln , second child , but first son of Nancy and Thomas , was born. ( 4 ) During most of eight years , Abraham lived in Kentucky . His father , always adrift in heart , tried two farms before abandoning Kentucky altogether . A shadowy figure , this Thomas ; the few memories of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to see visions in the forest . Once , it is said , he came home , all excitement , to tell his wife he had seen a giant riding on a lion , tearing up trees by the roots ; and thereupon , he took to his bed and kept it for several days . His son Abraham told this story of the giant on the lion to a playmate of his , and the two boys gravely discussed the existence of ghosts . Abraham thought his father " did n't exactly believe in them , " and seems to have been in about the same state of mind himself . He was quite sure he was " not much " afraid of the dark . This was due chiefly to the simple wisdom of a good woman , a neighbor , who had taught him to think of the night as a great room that God had darkened even as his friend darkened a room in her house by hanging something over the window. ( 5 ) The eight years of his childhood in Kentucky had few incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and young . The men found their one deep joy in the hunt . In lesser degree , they enjoyed the revivals which gave to the women their one escape out of themselves . A strange , almost terrible recovery of the primitive , were those religious furies of the days before the great forest had disappeared . What other figures in our history are quite so remarkable as the itinerant frontier priests , the circuit-riders as they are now called , who lived as Elijah did , whose temper was very much the temper of Elijah , in whose exalted narrowness of devotion , all that was stern , dark , foreboding  --  the very brood of the forest 's innermost heart  --  had found a voice . Their religion was ecstasy in homespun , a glory of violent singing , the release of a frantic emotion , formless but immeasurable , which at all other times , in the severity of the forest routine , gave no sign of its existence . A visitor remembered long afterward a handsome young woman who he thought was Nancy Hanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ecstatic women of the woods of Thrace , making her way among equally passionate worshipers , to the foot of the rude altar , and there casting herself into the arms of the man she was to marry. ( 6 ) So did thousands of forest women in those seasons when their communion with a mystic loneliness was confessed , when they gave tongue as simply as wild creatures to the nameless stirrings and promptings of that secret woodland where Pan was still the lord . And the day following the revival , they were again the silent , expressionless , much enduring , long-suffering forest wives , mothers of many children , toilers of the cabins , who cooked and swept and carried fuel by sunlight , and by firelight sewed and spun . It can easily be understood how these women , as a rule , exerted little influence on their sons . Their imaginative side was too deeply hidden , the nature of their pleasures too secret , too mysterious . Male youth , following its obvious pleasure , went with the men to the hunt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do likewise , was the incredible exception . In him had come to a head the deepest things in the forest life : the darkly feminine things , its silence , its mysticism , its secretiveness , its tragic patience . Abraham was such a boy . It is said that he astounded his father by refusing to own a gun . He earned terrible whippings by releasing animals caught in traps . Though he had in fullest measure the forest passion for listening to stories , the ever-popular tales of Indian warfare disgusted him . But let the tale take on any glint of the mystery of the human soul  --  as of Robinson Crusoe alone on his island , or of the lordliness of action , as in Columbus or Washington  --  and he was quick with interest . The stories of talking animals out of Aesop fascinated him . In this thrilled curiosity about the animals was the side of him least intelligible to men like his father . It lives in many anecdotes : of his friendship with a poor dog he had which he called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent its swallowing a frog ; of loitering on errands at the risk of whippings to watch the squirrels in the tree-tops ; of the crowning offense of his childhood , which earned him a mighty beating , the saving of a fawn 's life by scaring it off just as a hunter 's gun was leveled . And by way of comment on all this , there is the remark preserved in the memory of another boy to whom at the time it appeared most singular , " God might think as much of that little fawn as of some people . " Of him as of another gentle soul it might have been said that all the animals were his brothers and sisters. ( 7 ) One might easily imagine this peculiar boy who chose to remain at home while the men went out to slay , as the mere translation into masculinity of his mother , and of her mothers , of all the converging processions of forest women , who had passed from one to another the secret of their mysticism , coloring it many ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reached at last their concluding child . But this would only in part explain him . Their mysticism , as after-time was to show , he had undoubtedly inherited . So , too , from them , it may be , came another characteristic  --  that instinct to endure , to wait , to abide the issue of circumstance , which in the days of his power made him to the politicians as unintelligible as once he had been to the forest huntsmen . Nevertheless , the most distinctive part of those primitive women , the sealed passionateness of their spirits , he never from childhood to the end revealed . In the grown man appeared a quietude , a sort of tranced calm , that was appalling . From what part of his heredity did this derive ? Was it the male gift of the forest ? Did progenitors worthier than Thomas somehow cast through him to his alien son that peace they had found in the utter heart of danger , that apparent selflessness which is born of being ever unfailingly on guard ? It is plain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whippings , of which there appear to have been plenty , in silence , without anger . It was all in the day 's round . Whippings , like other things , came and went . What did it matter ? And the daily round , though monotonous , had even for the child a complement of labor . Especially there was much patient journeying back and forth with meal bags between his father 's cabin and the local mill . There was a little schooling , very little , partly from Nancy Lincoln , partly from another good woman , the miller 's kind old mother , partly at the crudest of wayside schools maintained very briefly by a wandering teacher who soon wandered on ; but out of this schooling very little result beyond the mastery of the A B C. ( 8 ) And even at this age , a pathetic eagerness to learn , to invade the wonder of the printed book ! Also a marked keenness of observation . He observed things which his elders overlooked . He had a better sense of direction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the wrong short-cut to a burning house . Cool , unexcitable , he was capable of presence of mind . Once at night when the door of the cabin was suddenly thrown open and a monster appeared on the threshold , a spectral thing in the darkness , furry , with the head of an ox , Thomas Lincoln shrank back aghast ; little Abraham , quicker-sighted and quicker-witted , slipped behind the creature , pulled at its furry mantle , and revealed a forest Diana , a bold girl who amused herself playing demon among the shadows of the moon . Seven years passed and his eighth birthday approached . All this while Thomas Lincoln had somehow kept his family in food , but never had he money in his pocket . His successive farms , bought on credit , were never paid for . An incurable vagrant , he came at last to the psychological moment when he could no longer impose himself on his community . He must take to the road in a hazard of new fortune . Indiana appeared to him the land of promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  except his carpenter 's tools , he traded for whisky , four hundred gallons . Somehow he obtained a rattletrap wagon and two horses . The family appear to have been loath to go . Nancy Lincoln had long been ailing and in low spirits , thinking much of what might happen to her children after her death . Abraham loved the country-side , and he had good friends in the miller and his kind old mother . But the vagrant Thomas would have his way . In the brilliancy of the Western autumn , with the ruined woods flaming scarlet and gold , these poor people took their last look at the cabin that had been their wretched shelter , and set forth into the world. ( 9 ) @# @# II THE MYSTERIOUS YOUTH Vagrants , or little better than vagrants , were Thomas Lincoln and his family making their way to Indiana . For a year after they arrived they were squatters , their home an " open-faced camp , " that is , a shanty with one wall missing , and instead of chimney , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretense of a house , Nancy Lincoln and her children spent the winter of 1816-1817 . Then Thomas resorted to his familiar practice of taking land on credit . The Lincolns were now part of a " settlement " of seven or eight families strung along a little stream known as Pigeon Creek . Here Thomas entered a quarter-section of fair land , and in the course of the next eleven years succeeded  --  wonderful to relate  --  in paying down sufficient money to give him title to about half . Meanwhile , poor fading Nancy went to her place . Pigeon Creek was an out-of-the-way nook in the still unsettled West , and Nancy during the two years she lived there could not have enjoyed much of the consolation of her religion . Perhaps now and then she had ghostly council of some stray circuit-rider . But for her the days of the ecstasies had gone by ; no great revival broke the seals of the spirit , stirred its deep waters , along Pigeon Creek . There was no religious service when she was laid to rest in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Months passed , the snow lay deep , before a passing circuit-rider held a burial service over her grave . Tradition has it that the boy Abraham brought this about very likely , at ten years old , he felt that her troubled spirit could not have peace till this was done . Shadowy as she is , ghostlike across the page of history , it is plain that she was a reality to her son . He not only loved her but revered her . He believed that from her he had inherited the better part of his genius . Many years after her death he said , " God bless my mother ; all that I am or ever hope to be I owe to her . " Nancy was not long without a successor . Thomas Lincoln , the next year , journeyed back to Kentucky and returned in triumph to Indiana , bringing as his wife , an old flame of his who had married , had been widowed , and was of a mind for further adventures . This Sarah Bush Lincoln , of less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger-willed . Even before this , Thomas had left the half-faced camp and moved into a cabin . But such a cabin ! It had neither door , nor window , nor floor . Sally Lincoln required her husband to make of it a proper house  --  by the standards of Pigeon Creek . She had brought with her as her dowry a wagonload of furniture . These comforts together with her strong will began a new era of relative comfort in the Lincoln cabin. ( 1 ) Sally Lincoln was a kind stepmother to Abraham who became strongly attached to her . In the rough and nondescript community of Pigeon Creek , a world of weedy farms , of miserable mud roads , of log farm-houses , the family life that was at least tolerable . The sordid misery described during her regime emerged from wretchedness to a state of by all the recorders of Lincoln 's early days seems to have ended about his twelfth year . At least , the vagrant suggestion disappeared . Though the life that succeeded was void of luxury , though it was rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of things , it was scarcely by peasant standards a life of hardship . There was food sufficient , if not very good ; protection from wind and weather ; fire in the winter time ; steady labor ; and social acceptance by the community of the creekside . That the labor was hard and long , went without saying . But as to that  --  as of the whippings in Kentucky  --  what else , from the peasant point of view , would you expect ? Abraham took it all with the same stoicism with which he had once taken the whippings . By the unwritten law of the creekside he was his father 's property , and so was his labor , until he came of age . Thomas used him as a servant or hired him out to other farmers . Stray recollections show us young Abraham working as a farm-hand for twenty-five cents the day , probably with " keep " in addition ; we glimpse him slaughtering hogs skilfully at thirty-one cents a day , for this was " rough work . " He became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , of his career as a farm-hand , Abraham got a few months of schooling , less than a year in all . A story that has been repeated a thousand times shows the raw youth by the cabin fire at night doing sums on the back of a wooden shovel , and shaving off its surface repeatedly to get a fresh page . He devoured every book that came his way , only a few to be sure , but generally great ones  --  the Bible , of course , and Aesop , Crusoe , Pilgrim 's Progress , and a few histories , these last unfortunately of the poorer sort . He early displayed a bent for composition , scribbling verses that were very poor , and writing burlesque tales about his acquaintances in what passed for a Biblical style. ( 2 ) One great experience broke the monotony of the life on Pigeon Creek . He made a trip to New Orleans as a " hand " on a flatboat . Of this trip little is known though much may be surmised . To his deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majesty of the vast river ; the pageant of its immense travel ; the steamers heavily laden ; the fleets of barges ; the many towns ; the nights of stars over wide sweeps of water ; the stately plantation houses along the banks ; the old French city with its crowds , its bells , the shipping , the strange faces and the foreign speech ; all the bewildering evidence that there were other worlds besides Pigeon Creek ! What seed of new thinking was sown in his imagination by this Odyssey we shall never know . The obvious effect in the ten years of his life in Indiana was produced at Pigeon Creek . The " settlement " was within fifteen miles of the Ohio . It lay in that southerly fringe of Indiana which received early in the century many families of much the same estate , character and origin as the Lincolns ,  --  poor whites of the edges of the great forest working outward toward the prairies . Located on good land not far from a great highway , the Ohio , it illustrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many such settlements , the transformation of the wandering forester of the lower class into a peasant farmer . Its life was of the earth , earthy ; though it retained the religious traditions of the forest , their significance was evaporating ; mysticism was fading into emotionalism ; the camp-meeting was degenerating into a picnic . The supreme social event , the wedding , was attended by festivities that filled twenty-four hours : a race of male guests in the forenoon with a bottle of whisky for a prize ; an Homeric dinner at midday ; " an afternoon of rough games and outrageous practical jokes ; a supper and dance at night interrupted by the successive withdrawals of the bride and groom , attended by ceremonies and jests of more than Rabelaisian crudeness ; and a noisy dispersal next day . " ( 3 ) The intensities of the forest survived in hard drinking , in the fury of the fun-making , and in the hunt . The forest passion for storytelling had in no way decreased . In this atmosphere , about eighteen and nineteen , Abraham shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw-honed , ungainly man , six feet four inches tall , of unusual muscular strength . His strength was one of the fixed conditions of his development . It delivered him from all fear of his fellows . He had plenty of peculiarities . He was ugly , awkward ; he lacked the wanton appetites of the average sensual man . And these peculiarities without his great strength as his warrant might have brought him into ridicule . As it was , whatever his peculiarities , in a society like that of Pigeon Creek , the man who could beat all competitors , wrestling or boxing , was free from molestation . But Lincoln instinctively had another aim in life than mere freedom to be himself . Two characteristics that were so significant in his childhood continued with growing vitality in his young manhood : his placidity and his intense sense of comradeship . The latter , however , had undergone a change . It was no longer the comradeship of the wild creatures . That spurt of physical expansion , the swift rank growth to his tremendous stature , swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world of birds and beasts and into the world of men . He took the new world with the same unfailing but also unexcitable curiosity with which he had taken the other , the world of squirrels , flowers , fawns . Here as there , the difference from his mother , deep though their similarities may have been , was sharply evident . Had he been wholly at one with her religiously , the gift of telling speech which he now began to display might have led him into a course that would have rejoiced her heart , might have made him a boy preacher , and later , a great revivalist . His father and elder sister while on Pigeon Creek joined the local Baptist Church . But Abraham did not follow them . Nor is there a single anecdote linking him in any way with the fervors of camp meeting . On the contrary , what little is remembered , is of a cool aloofness. ( 4 ) The inscrutability of the forest was his  --  what it gave to the stealthy , cautious men who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give vent to their feelings . Therefore , in Lincoln there was always a double life , outer and inner , the outer quietly companionable , the inner , solitary , mysterious . It was the outer life that assumed its first definite phase in the years on Pigeon Creek . During those years , Lincoln discovered his gift of story-telling . He also discovered humor . In the employment of both talents , he accepted as a matter of course the tone of the young ruffians among whom he dwelt . Very soon this powerful fellow , who could throw any of them in a wrestle , won the central position among them by a surer title , by the power to delight . And any one who knows how peasant schools of art arise  --  for that matter , all schools of art that are vital  --  knows how he did it . In this connection , his famous biographers , Nicolay and Hay , reveal a certain externality by objecting that a story attributed to him is ancient . All stories are ancient . Not the tale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing . In later years , Lincoln wrote down every good story that he heard , and filed it. ( 5 ) When it reappeared it had become his own . Who can doubt that this deliberate assimilation , the typical artistic process , began on Pigeon Creek ? Lincoln never would have captured as he did his plowboy audience , set them roaring with laughter in the intervals of labor , had he not given them back their own tales done over into new forms brilliantly beyond their powers of conception . That these tales were gross , even ribald , might have been taken for granted , even had we not positive evidence of the fact . Otherwise none of that uproarious laughter which we may be sure sounded often across shimmering harvest fields while stalwart young pagans , ever ready to pause , leaned , bellowing , on the handles of their scythes , Abe Lincoln having just then finished a story . Though the humor of these stories was Falstaffian , to say the least , though Lincoln was cock of the walk among the plowboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him here comes into view . Not an anecdote survives that in any way suggests personal licentiousness . Scrupulous men who in after-time were offended by his coarseness of speech  --  for more or less of the artist of Pigeon Creek stuck to him almost to the end ; he talked in fables , often in gross fables  --  these men , despite their annoyance , felt no impulse to attribute to him personal habits in harmony with his tales . On the other hand , they were puzzled by their own impression , never wavering , that he was " pureminded . " The clue which they did not have lay in the nature of his double life . That part of him which , in our modern jargon , we call his " reactions " obeyed a curious law . They dwelt in his outer life without penetrating to the inner ; but all his impulses of personal action were securely seated deep within . Even at nineteen , for any one attuned to spiritual meaning , he would have struck the note of mystery , faintly , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this reached the minds of his rollicking comrades of the harvest field . It was not for such as they to perceive the problem of his character , to suspect that he was a genius , or to guess that a time would come when sincere men would form impressions of him as dissimilar as black and white . And so far as it went the observation of the plowboys was correct . The man they saw was indeed a reflection of themselves . But it was a reflection only . Their influence entered into the real man no more than the image in a mirror has entered into the glass . @# @# III . A VILLAGE LEADER Though placid , this early Lincoln was not resigned . He differed from the boors of Pigeon Creek in wanting some other sort of life . What it was he wanted , he did not know . His reading had not as yet given him definite ambitions . It may well be that New Orleans was the clue to such stirring in him as there was of that discontent which fanciful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any imaginative youth be content with Pigeon Creek ? In the spring of 1830 , shortly after he came of age , he agreed for once with his father whose chronic vagrancy had reasserted itself . The whole family set out again on their wanderings and made their way in an oxcart to a new halting place on the Sangamon River in Illinois . There Abraham helped his father clear another piece of land for another illusive " start " in life . The following spring he parted with his family and struck out for himself. ( 1 ) His next adventure was a second trip as a boatman to New Orleans . Can one help suspecting there was vague hope in his heart that he might be adventuring to the land of hearts ' desire ? If there was , the yokels who were his fellow boatmen never suspected it . One of them long afterward asserted that Lincoln returned from New Orleans fiercely rebellious against its central institution , slavery , and determined to " hit that thing " whenever he could . The legend centers in his witnessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a style quite unlike any of his authentic utterances . The authority for all this is doubtful. ( 2 ) Furthermore , the Lincoln of 1831 was not yet awakened . That inner life in which such a reaction might take place was still largely dormant . The outer life , the life of the harvest clown , was still a thick insulation . Apparently , the waking of the inner life , the termination of its dormant stage , was reserved for an incident far more personal that fell upon him in desolating force a few years later . Following the New Orleans venture , came a period as storekeeper for a man named Denton Offut , in perhaps the least desirable town in Illinois  --  a dreary little huddle of houses gathered around Rutledge 's Mill on the Sangamon River and called New Salem. ( 3 ) Though a few of its people were of a better sort than any Lincoln had yet known except , perhaps , the miller 's family in the old days in Kentucky  --  and still a smaller few were of fine quality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatality for unpromising neighborhoods overhangs like a doom the early part of this strange life . All accounts of New Salem represent it as predominantly a congregation of the worthless , flung together by unaccountable accident at a spot where there was no genuine reason for a town 's existence . A casual town , created by drifters , and void of settled purpose . Small wonder that ere long it vanished from the map ; that after a few years its drifting congregation dispersed to every corner of the horizon , and was no more . But during its brief existence it staged an episode in the development of Lincoln 's character . However , this did not take place at once . And before it happened , came another turn of his soul 's highway scarcely less important . He discovered , or thought he discovered , what he wanted . His vague ambition took shape . He decided to try to be a politician . At twenty-three , after living in New Salem less than a year , this audacious , not to say impertinent , young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate for the Legislature . At this time that humility which was eventually his characteristic had not appeared . It may be dated as subsequent to New Salem  --  a further evidence that the deep spiritual experience which closed this chapter formed a crisis . Before then , at New Salem as at Pigeon Creek , he was but a variant , singularly decent , of the boisterous , frolicking , impertinent type that instinctively sought the laxer neighborhoods of the frontier . An echo of Pigeon Creek informed the young storekeeper 's first state paper , the announcement of his candidacy , in the year 1832 . His first political speech was in a curious vein , glib , intimate and fantastic : " Fellow citizens , I presume you all know who I am . I am humble Abraham Lincoln . I have been solicited by many friends to become a candidate for the Legislature . My politics are short and sweet like the old woman 's dance . I am in favor of a national bank . I am in favor of the internal improvement system and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles . If elected , I shall be thankful ; if not it will be all the same . " ( 4 ) However , this bold throw of the dice of fortune was not quite so impertinent as it seems . During the months when he was in charge of Offut 's grocery store he had made a conquest of New Salem . The village grocery in those days was the village club . It had its constant gathering of loafers all of whom were endowed with votes . It was the one place through which passed the whole population , in and out , one time or another . To a clever storekeeper it gave a chance to establish a following . Had he , as Lincoln had , the gift of story-telling , the gift of humor , he was a made man . Pigeon Creek over again ! Lincoln 's wealth of funny stories gave Offut 's grocery somewhat the role of a vaudeville theater and made the storekeeper as popular a man as there was in New Salem . In another way he repeated his conquest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as Clary 's Grove whose insolent young toughs led by their chief , Jack Armstrong , were the terror of the neighborhood . The groceries paid them tribute in free drinks . Any luckless storekeeper who incurred their displeasure found his store some fine morning a total wreck . Lincoln challenged Jack Armstrong to a duel with fists . It was formally arranged . A ring was formed ; the whole village was audience ; and Lincoln thrashed him to a finish . But this was only a small part of his triumph . His physical prowess , joined with his humor and his companionableness ; entirely captivated Clary 's Grove . Thereafter , it was storekeeper Lincoln 's pocket borough ; its ruffians were his body-guard . Woe to any one who made trouble for their hero . There were still other causes for his quick rise to the position of village leader . His unfailing kindness was one ; his honesty was another . Tales were related of his scrupulous dealings , such as walking a distance of miles in order to correct a trifling error he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper weight of tea . Then , too , by New Salem standards , he was educated . Long practice on the shovel at Pigeon Creek had given him a good handwriting , and one of the first things he did at New Salem was to volunteer to be clerk of elections . And there was a distinct moral superiority . Little as this would have signified unbacked by his giant strength since it had that authority behind it his morality set him apart from his followers , different , imposing . He seldom , if ever , drank whisky . Sobriety was already the rule of his life , both outward and inward . At the same time he was not censorious . He accepted the devotion of Clary 's Grove without the slightest attempt to make over its bravoes in his own image . He sympathized with its ideas of sport . For all his kindliness to humans of every sort much of his sensitiveness for animals had passed away . He was not averse to cock fighting ; he enjoyed a horse race. ( 5 ) Altogether , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to himself , he was quite as much in the tone of New Salem as ever in that of Pigeon Creek . When the election came he got every vote in New Salem except three. ( 6 ) But the village was a small part of Sangamon County . Though Lincoln received a respectable number of votes elsewhere , his total was well down in the running . He remained an inconspicuous minority candidate . Meanwhile Offut 's grocery had failed . In the midst of the legislative campaign , Offut 's farmer storekeeper volunteered for the Indian War with Black Hawk , but returned to New Salem shortly before the election without having once smelled powder . Since his peers were not of a mind to give him immediate occupation in governing , he turned again to business . He formed a partnership with a man named Berry . They bought on credit the wreck of a grocery that had been sacked by Lincoln 's friends of Clary 's Grove , and started business as " General Merchants , " under the style of Berry &; Lincoln . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was far more inclined to read any chance book that came his way than to attend to business , and that he had " no money sense . " The new firm went the way of Offut 's grocery , leaving nothing behind it but debt . The debts did not trouble Berry ; Lincoln assumed them all . They formed a dreadful load which he bore with his usual patience and little by little discharged . Fifteen years passed before again he was a free man financially . A new and powerful influence came into his life during the half idleness of his unsuccessful storekeeping . It is worth repeating in his own words , or what seems to be the fairly accurate recollection of his words : " One day a man who was migrating to the West , drove up in front of my store with a wagon which contained his family and household plunder . He asked me if I would buy an old barrel for which he had no room in his wagon , and which he said contained nothing of special value . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and paid him , I think , a half a dollar for it . Without further examination I put it away in the store and forgot all about it Sometime after , in overhauling things , I came upon the barrel and emptying it upon the floor to see what it contained , I found at the bottom of the rubbish a complete edition of Blackstone 's Commentaries . I began to read those famous works , and I had plenty of time ; for during the long summer days when the farmers were busy with their crops , my customers were few and far between . The more I read , the more intensely interested I became . Never in my whole life was my mind so thoroughly absorbed . I read until I devoured them . " ( 7 ) The majesty of the law at the bottom of a barrel of trash discovered at a venture and taking instant possession of the discoverer 's mind ! Like the genius issuing grandly in the smoke cloud from the vase drawn up out of the sea by the fisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the only magic casket discovered by the idle store-keeper , the broken seals of which released mighty presences . Both Shakespeare and Burns were revealed to him in this period . Never after did either for a moment cease to be his companion . These literary treasures were found at Springfield twenty miles from New Salem , whither Lincoln went on foot many a time to borrow books . His subsistence , after the failure of Berry &; Lincoln , was derived from the friendliness of the County Surveyor Calhoun , who was a Democrat , while Lincoln called himself a Whig . Calhoun offered him the post of assistant . In accepting , Lincoln again displayed the honesty that was beginning to be known as his characteristic . He stipulated that he should be perfectly free to express his opinions , that the office should not be in any respect , a bribe . This being conceded , he went to work furiously on a treatise upon surveying , and astonishingly soon , with the generous help of the schoolmaster of New Salem , was able to take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Hannah Armstrong ' fixed ' on his pants so the briers would not wear them out . " ( 8 ) Thus time passed until 1834 when he staked his only wealth , his popularity , in the gamble of an election . This time he was successful . During the following winter he sat in the Legislature of Illinois ; a huge , uncouth , mainly silent member , making apparently no impression whatever , very probably striking the educated members as a nonentity in homespun. ( 9 ) In the spring of 1835 , he was back in New Salem , busy again with his surveying . Kind friends had secured him the office of local postmaster . The delivery of letters was now combined with going to and fro as a surveyor . As the mail came but once a week , and as whatever he had to deliver could generally be carried in his hat , and as payment was in proportion to business done , his revenues continued small . Nevertheless , in the view of New Salem , he was getting on . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of those spiritual agonies of which he was destined to endure so many , approached . Hitherto , since childhood , women had played no part in his story . All the recollections of his youth are vague in their references to the feminine . As a boy at Pigeon Creek when old Thomas was hiring him out , the women of the settlement liked to have him around , apparently because he was kindly and ever ready to do odd jobs in addition to his regular work . However , until 1835 , his story is that of a man 's man , possibly because there was so much of the feminine in his own make-up . In 1835 came a change . A girl of New Salem , a pretty village maiden , the best the poor place could produce , revealed him to himself . Sweet Ann Rutledge , the daughter of the tavern-keeper , was his first love . But destiny was against them . A brief engagement was terminated by her sudden death late in the summer of 1835 . Of this shadowy love-affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been woven about it . Its significance for after-time is in Lincoln 's " reaction . " There had been much sickness in New Salem the summer in which Ann died . Lincoln had given himself freely as nurse  --  the depth of his companionableness thus being proved  --  and was in an overwrought condition when his sorrow struck him . A last interview with the dying girl , at which no one was present , left him quite unmanned . A period of violent agitation followed . For a time he seemed completely transformed . The sunny Lincoln , the delight of Clary 's Grove , had vanished . In his place was a desolated soul  --  a brother to dragons , in the terrible imagery of Job  --  a dweller in the dark places of affliction . It was his mother reborn in him . It was all the shadowiness of his mother 's world ; all that frantic reveling in the mysteries of woe to which , hitherto , her son had been an alien . To the simple minds of the villagers with their hard-headed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief , in the outer layer of consciousness , this revelation of an emotional terror was past understanding . Some of them , true to their type , pronounced him insane . He was watched with especial vigilance during storms , fogs , damp gloomy weather , " for fear of an accident . " Surely , it was only a crazy man , in New Salem psychology , who was heard to say , " I can never be reconciled to have the snow , rains and storms beat upon her grave . " ( 10 ) In this crucial moment when the real base of his character had been suddenly revealed  --  all the passionateness of the forest shadow , the unfathomable gloom laid so deep at the bottom of his soul  --  he was carried through his spiritual eclipse by the loving comprehension of two fine friends . New Salem was not all of the sort of Clary 's Grove . Near by on a farm , in a lovely , restful landscape , lived two people who deserve to be remembered , Bowlin Green and his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there in the gleaming days of autumn , when everywhere in the near woods flickered downward , slowly , idly , the falling leaves golden and scarlet , Lincoln recovered his equanimity. ( 11 ) But the hero of Pigeon Creek , of Clary 's Grove , did not quite come hack . In the outward life , to be sure , a day came when the sunny story-teller , the victor of Jack Armstrong , was once more what Jack would have called his real self . In the inner life where alone was his reality , the temper which affliction had revealed to him was established . Ever after , at heart , he was to dwell alone , facing , silent , those inscrutable things which to the primitive mind are things of every day . Always , he was to have for his portion in his real self , the dimness of twilight , or at best , the night with its stars , " never glad , confident morning again . " @# @# IV . REVELATIONS From this time during many years almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have indicated , in one way or another , their vision of a constant quality . The observers of the surface did not see it . That is to say , Lincoln did not at once cast off any of his previous characteristics . It is doubtful if he ever did . His experience was tenaciously cumulative . Everything he once acquired , he retained , both in the outer life and the inner ; and therefore , to those who did not have the clue to him , he appeared increasingly contradictory , one thing on the surface , another within . Clary 's Grove and the evolutions from Clary 's Grove , continued to think of him as their leader . On the other hand , men who had parted with the mere humanism of Clary 's Grove , who were a bit analytical , who thought themselves still more analytical , seeing somewhat beneath the surface , reached conclusions similar to those of a shrewd Congressman who long afterward said that Lincoln was not a leader of men but a manager of men. ( 1 ) This astute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nevertheless , it betrays much both of the observer and of the man he tried to observe . In the Congressman 's day , what he thought he saw was in reality the shadow of a Lincoln that had passed away , passed so slowly , so imperceptibly that few people knew it had passed . During many years following 1835 , the distinction in the main applied . So thought the men who , like Lincoln 's latest law partner , William H. Herndon , were not derivatives of Clary 's Grove . The Lincoln of these days was the only one Herndon knew . How deeply he understood Lincoln is justly a matter of debate ; but this , at least , he understood  --  that Clary 's Grove , in attributing to Lincoln its own idea of leadership , was definitely wrong . He saw in Lincoln , in all the larger matters , a tendency to wait on events , to take the lead indicated by events , to do what shallow people would have called mere drifting . To explain this , he labeled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as most labels are . But Herndon 's effort to find one is significant . In these years , Lincoln took the initiative  --  when he took it at all  --  in a way that most people did not recognize . His spirit was ever aloof . It was only the every-day , the external Lincoln that came into practical contact with his fellows . This is especially true of the growing politician . He served four consecutive terms in the Legislature without doing anything that had the stamp of true leadership . He was not like either of the two types of politicians that generally made up the legislatures of those days  --  the men who dealt in ideas as political counters , and the men who were grafters without in their naive way knowing that they were grafters . As a member of the Legislature , Lincoln did not deal in ideas . He was instinctively incapable of graft A curiously routine politician , one who had none of the earmarks familiar in such a person . Aloof , and yet , more than ever companionable , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired a measure of power  --  was wholly personal . Though called a Whig , it was not as a party man but as a personal friend that he was able to carry through his legislative triumphs . His most signal achievement was wholly a matter of personal politics . There was a general demand for the removal of the capital from its early seat at Vandalia , and rivalry among other towns was keen . Sangamon County was bent on winning the prize for its own Springfield . Lincoln was put in charge of the Springfield strategy . How he played his cards may be judged from the recollections of another member who seems to have anticipated that noble political maxim , " What 's the Constitution between friends ? " " Lincoln , " he says , " made Webb and me vote for the removal , though we belonged to the southern end of the state . We defended our vote before our constituents by saying that necessity would ultimately force the seat of government to a central position ; but in reality , we gave the vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oblige our friend , and because we recognized him as our leader . " ( 3 ) And yet on the great issues of the day he could not lead them . In 1837 , the movement of the militant abolitionists , still but a few years old , was beginning to set the Union by the ears . The illegitimate child of Calvinism and the rights of man , it damned with one anathema every holder of slaves and also every opponent of slavery except its own uncompromising adherents . Its animosity was trained particularly on every suggestion that designed to uproot slavery without creating an economic crisis , that would follow England 's example , and terminate the " peculiar institution " by purchase . The religious side of abolition came out in its fury against such ideas . Slave-holders were Canaanites . The new cult were God 's own people who were appointed to feel anew the joy of Israel hewing Agag asunder . Fanatics , terrible , heroic , unashamed , they made two sorts of enemies  --  not only the partisans of slavery , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated also the blood-lust that would make the hewing of Agag a respectable device of political science . Among the partisans of slavery were the majority of the Illinois Legislature . Early in 1837 , they passed resolutions condemning abolitionism . Whereupon it was revealed  --  not that anybody at the time cared to know the fact , or took it to heart  --  that among the other sort of the enemies of abolition was our good young friend , everybody 's good friend , Abe Lincoln . He drew up a protest against the Legislature 's action ; but for all his personal influence in other affairs , he could persuade only one member to sign with him . Not his to command at will those who " recognized him as their leader " in the orthodox political game  --  so discreet , in that it left principles for some one else to be troubled about ! Lincoln 's protest was quite too far out of the ordinary for personal politics to endure it . The signers were asked to proclaim their belief " that the institution of slavery is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to promote than to abate its evils . " ( 4 ) The singular originality of this position , sweeping aside as vain both participants in the new political duel , was quite lost on the little world in which Lincoln lived . For after-time it has the interest of a bombshell that failed to explode . It is the dawn of Lincoln 's intellect . In his lonely inner life , this crude youth , this lover of books in a village where books were curiosities , had begun to think . The stages of his transition from mere story-telling yokel  --  intellectual only as the artist is intellectual , in his methods of handling  --  to the man of ideas , are wholly lost . And in this fact we have a prophecy of all the years to come . Always we shall seek in vain for the early stages of Lincoln 's ideas . His mind will never reveal itself until the moment at which it engages the world . No wonder , in later times , his close associates pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keenest of his observers said that the more you knew of Lincoln , the less you knew of him. ( 5 ) Except for the handicap of his surroundings , his intellectual start would seem belated ; even allowing for his handicap , it was certainly slow . He was now twenty-eight . Pretty well on to reveal for the first time intellectual power ! Another characteristic here . His mind worked slowly . But it is worth observing that the ideas of the protest were never abandoned . Still a third characteristic , mental tenacity . To the end of his days , he looked askance at the temper of abolitionism , regarded it ever as one of the chief evils of political science . And quite as significant was another idea of the protest which also had developed from within , which also he never abandoned . On the question of the power of the national government with regard to slavery , he took a position not in accord with either of the political creeds of his day . The Democrats had already formulated their doctrine that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " glorified policeman " of a certain school of publicists reduced almost to a minus quantity . The Whigs , though amiably vague on most things except money-making by state aid , were supposed to stand for a " strong central government " . Abolitionism had forced on both parties a troublesome question , " What about slavery in the District of Columbia , where the national government was supreme ? " The Democrats were prompt in their reply : Let the glorified policeman keep the peace and leave private interests , such as slave-holding , alone . The Whigs evaded , tried not to apply their theory of " strong " government ; they were fearful lest they offend one part of their membership if they asserted that the nation had no right to abolish slavery in the District , fearful of offending others if they did not . Lincoln 's protest asserted that " the Congress of the United States has the power , under the Constitution , to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia but the power ought not to be exercised , unless at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln , when suddenly out of the storm and stress that followed Ann 's death his mentality flashes forth , has an attitude toward political power that was not a consequence of his environment , that sets him apart as a type of man rare in the history of statesmanship . What other American politician of his day  --  indeed , very few politicians of any day  --  would have dared to assert at once the existence of a power and the moral obligation not to use it ? The instinctive American mode of limiting power is to deny its existence . Our politicians so deeply distrust our temperament that whatever they may say for rhetorical effect , they will not , whenever there is any danger of their being taken at their word , trust anything to moral law . Their minds are normally mechanical . The specific , statutory limitation is the only one that for them has reality . The truth that temper in politics is as great a factor as law was no more comprehensible to the politicians of 1837 than , say Hamlet or The Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln understood . Somehow he had found it in the depths of his own nature . The explanation , if any , is to be found in his heredity . Out of the shadowy parts of him , beyond the limits of his or any man 's conscious vision , dim , unexplored , but real and insistent as those forest recesses from which his people came , arise the two ideas : the faith in a mighty governing power ; the equal faith that it should use its might with infinite tenderness , that it should be slow to compel results , even the result of righteousness , that it should be tolerant of human errors , that it should transform them slowly , gradually , as do the gradual forces of nature , as do the sun and the rain . And such was to be the real Lincoln whenever he spoke out , to the end . His tonic was struck by his first significant utterance at the age of twenty-eight . How inevitable that it should have no significance to the congregation of good fellows who thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who put up with their friend 's vagary , and speedily forgot it . The moment was a dreary one in Lincoln 's fortunes . By dint of much reading of borrowed books , he had succeeded in obtaining from the easy-going powers that were in those days , a license to practise law . In the spring of 1837 he removed to Springfield . He had scarcely a dollar in his pocket . Riding into Springfield on a borrowed horse , with all the property he owned , including his law books , in two saddlebags , he went to the only cabinet-maker in the town and ordered a single bedstead . He then went to the store of Joshua F. Speed . The meeting , an immensely eventful one for Lincoln , as well as a classic in the history of genius in poverty , is best told in Speed 's words : " He came into my store , set his saddle-bags on the counter and inquired what the furnishings for a single bedstead would cost . I took slate and pencil , made a calculation and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars in all . Said he : ' It is probably cheap enough , but I want to say that , cheap as it is , I have not the money to pay ; but if you will credit me until Christmas , and my experiment here as a lawyer is a success , I will pay you then . If I fail in that I will probably never pay you at all . ' The tone of his voice was so melancholy that I felt for him . I looked up at him and I thought then as I think now that I never saw so gloomy and melancholy a face in my life . I said to him : ' So small a debt seems to affect you so deeply , I think I can suggest a plan by which you will be able to attain your end without incurring any debt . I have a very large room and a very large double bed in it , which you are perfectly welcome to share with me if you choose . ' ' Where is your room ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing to the stairs leading from the store to my room . Without saying a word , he took his saddle-bags on his arm , went upstairs , set them down on the floor , came down again , and with a face beaming with pleasure and smiles exclaimed , ' Well , Speed , I 'm moved . ' " ( 6 ) This was the beginning of a friendship which appears to have been the only one of its kind Lincoln ever had . Late in life , with his gifted private secretaries , with one or two brilliant men whom he did not meet until middle age , he had something like intimate comradeship . But even they did not break the prevailing solitude of his inner life . His aloofness of soul became a fixed condition . The one intruder in that lonely inner world was Speed . In the great collection of Lincoln 's letters none have the intimate note except the letters to Speed . And even these are not truly intimate with the exception of a single group inspired all by the same train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nature was incurable . The exceptional group of letters involve his final love-affair . Four years after his removal to Springfield , Lincoln became engaged to Miss Mary Todd . By that time he had got a start at the law and was no longer in grinding poverty . If not yet prosperous , he had acquired " prospects "  --  the strong likelihood of better things to come so dear to the buoyant heart of the early West . Hospitable Springfield , some of whose best men had known him in the Legislature , opened its doors to him . His humble origin , his poor condition , were forgiven . In true Western fashion , he was frankly put on trial to show what was in him . If he could " make good " no further questions would be asked . And in every-day matters , his companionableness rose to the occasion . Male Springfield was captivated almost as easily as New Salem . But all this was of the outer life . If the ferment within was constant between 1835 and 1840 , the fact is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a restless emotional life . In the rebound after the woe following Ann 's death , he had gone questing after happiness  --  such a real thing to him , now that he had discovered the terror of unhappiness  --  in a foolish half-hearted courtship of a bouncing , sensible girl named Mary Owens , who saw that he was not really in earnest , decided that he was deficient in those " little links that make up a woman 's happiness , " and sent him about his business  --  rather , on the whole , to his relief. ( 7 ) The affair with Miss Todd had a different tone from the other . The lady was of another world socially . The West in those days swarmed with younger sons , or the equivalents of younger sons , seeking their fortunes , whom sisters and cousins were frequently visiting . Mary Todd was sister-in-law to a leading citizen of Springfield . Her origin was of Kentucky and Virginia , with definite claims to distinction . Though a family genealogy mounts as high as the sixth century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were military men of some repute , two great uncles who were governors , and another who was a cabinet minister . Rather imposing contrasted with the family tree of the child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks ! Even more significant was the lady 's education . She had been to a school where young ladies of similar social pretensions were allowed to speak only the French language . She was keenly aware of the role marked out for her by destiny , and quite convinced that she would always in every way live up to it . The course of her affair with Lincoln did not run smooth . There were wide differences of temperament ; quarrels of some sort  --  just what , gossip to this day has busied itself trying to discover  --  and on January 1 , 1841 , the engagement was broken . Before the end of the month he wrote to his law partner apologizing for his inability to be coherent on business matters . " For not giving you a general summary of news , you must pardon me ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the most miserable man living . If what I feel were distributed to the whole human family , there would not be one cheerful face on earth . Whether I shall ever be better , I can not tell . I awfully forebode I shall not . To remain as I am is impossible . I must die or be better , it appears to me . . . a change of scene might help me . " His friend Speed became his salvation . Speed closed out his business and carried Lincoln off to visit his own relations in Kentucky . It was the devotion of Bowlin Green and his wife over again . But the psychology of the event was much more singular . Lincoln , in the inner life , had progressed a long way since the death of Ann , and the progress was mainly in the way of introspection , of self-analysis . He had begun to brood . As always , the change did not reveal itself until an event in the outward life called it forth like a rising ghost from the abyss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his real self , beneath the thick disguise of his external sunniness , he was forever brooding , questioning , analyzing , searching after the hearts of things both within and without .. " In the winter of 1840 and 1841 , " writes Speed , " he was unhappy about the engagement to his wife  --  not being entirely satisfied that his heart was going with his hand . How much he suffered then on that account , none knew so well as myself ; he disclosed his whole heart to me . In the summer of 1841 I became engaged to my wife . He was here on a visit when I courted her ; and strange to say , something of the same feeling which I regarded as so foolish in him took possession of me , and kept me very unhappy from the time of my engagement until I was married . This will explain the deep interest he manifested in his letters on my account .... One thing is plainly discernible ; if I had not been married and happy , far more happy than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . " Whether or not Speed was entirely right in his final conclusion , it is plain that he and Lincoln were remarkably alike in temperament ; that whatever had caused the break in Lincoln 's engagement was repeated in his friend 's experience when the latter reached a certain degree of emotional tension ; that this paralleling of Lincoln 's own experience in the experience of the friend so like himself , broke tip for once the solitude of his inner life and delivered him from some dire inward terror . Both men were deeply introspective . Each had that overpowering sense of the emotional responsibilities of marriage , which is bred in the bone of certain hyper-sensitive types  --  at least in the Anglo-Saxon race . But neither realized this trait in himself until , having blithely pursued his impulse to the point of committal , his spiritual conscience suddenly awakened and he asked of his heart , " Do I truly love her ? Am I perfectly sure the emotion is permanent ? " It is on this speculation that the unique group of the intimate letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's return to Springfield , while Speed was wrestling with the demon of self-analysis . In the period which they cover , Lincoln delivered himself from that same demon and recovered Serenity . Before long he was writing : " I know what the painful point with you is at all times when you are unhappy ; it is an apprehension that you do not love her as you should . What nonsense ! How came you to court her ? Was it because you thought she deserved it and that you had given her reason to expect it ? If it was for that , why did not the same reason make you court Ann Todd , and at least twenty others of whom you can think , to whom it would apply with greater force than to her ? Did you court her for her wealth ? Why , you said she had none . But you say you reasoned yourself into it . What do you mean by that ? Was it not that you found yourself unable to reason yourself out of it ? " And much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture unintentionally of his own state of mind no less than of his friend 's . This strange episode reveals also that amid Lincoln 's silences , while the outward man appeared engrossed in everyday matters , the inward man had been seeking religion . His failure to accept the forms of his mother 's creed did not rest on any lack of the spiritual need . Though undefined , his religion glimmers at intervals through the Speed letters . When Speed 's fiancee fell ill and her tortured lover was in a paroxysm of remorse and grief , Lincoln wrote : " I hope and believe that your present anxiety and distress about her health and her life must and will forever banish those horrid doubts which I know you sometimes felt as to the truth of your affection for her . If they can once and forever be removed ( and I feel a presentment that the Almighty has sent your present affliction expressly for that object ) surely nothing can come in their stead to fill their immeasurable measure of misery . . . Should she , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is indeed a great consolation to know she is so well prepared to meet it . " Again he wrote : " I was always superstitious . I believe God made me one of the instruments of bringing you and your Fanny together , which union I have no doubt lie had foreordained . Whatever He designs He will do for me yet . ' Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord ' is my text now . " The duality in self-torture of these spiritual brethren endured in all about a year and a half , and closed with Speed 's marriage . Lincoln was now entirely delivered from his demon . He wrote Speed a charming letter , serene , affectionate , touched with gentle banter , valiant though with a hint of disillusion as to their common type . " I tell you , Speed , our forebodings ( for which you and I are peculiar ) are all the worst sort of nonsense . . You say you much fear that that elysium of which you have dreamed so much is never to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare swear it will not be the fault of her who is now your wife . I have no doubt that it is the peculiar misfortune of both you and me to dream dreams of elysium far exceeding all that anything earthly can realize . " ( 8 ) @# @# V. PROSPERITY How Lincoln 's engagement was patched up is as delicious an uncertainty , from gossip 's point of view , as how it had been broken off . Possibly , as many people have asserted , it was brought about by an event of which , in the irony of fate , Lincoln ever after felt ashamed. ( 1 ) An impulsive , not overwise politician , James Shields , a man of many peculiarities , was saucily lampooned in a Springfield paper by some jaunty girls , one of whom was Miss Todd . Somehow ,  --  the whole affair is very dim ,  --  Lincoln acted as their literary adviser . Shields demanded the name of his detractor ; Lincoln assumed the responsibility ; a challenge followed . Lincoln was in a ridiculous position . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once thereafter ; he gravely proposed the impossible . He demanded conditions which would have made the duel a burlesque  --  a butcher 's match with cavalry broadswords . But Shields , who was flawlessly literal , insisted . The two met and only on the dueling ground was the quarrel at last talked into oblivion by the seconds . Whether this was the cause of the reconciliation with Miss Todd , or a consequence , or had nothing to do with it , remains for the lovers of the unimportant to decide . The only sure fact in this connection is the marriage which took place November 4 , 1842. ( 2 ) Mrs. Lincoln 's character has been much discussed . Gossip , though with very little to go on , has built up a tradition that the marriage was unhappy . If one were to believe the half of what has been put in print , one would have to conclude that the whole business was a wretched mistake ; that Lincoln found married life intolerable because of the fussily dictatorial self-importance of his wife . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is traceable to the parties themselves . Probably it will never be known till the end of time what is false in them , what true . About all that can be disengaged from this cloud of illusive witnesses is that Springfield wondered why Mary Todd married Lincoln . He was still poor ; so poor that after marriage they lived at the Globe Tavern on four dollars a week . And the lady had been sought by prosperous men ! The lowliness of Lincoln 's origin went ill with her high notions of her family 's importance . She was downright , high-tempered , dogmatic , but social ; he was devious , slow to wrath , tentative , solitary ; his very appearance , then as afterward , was against him . Though not the hideous man he was later made out to be  --  the " gorilla " of enemy caricaturists  --  he was rugged of feature , with a lower lip that tended to protrude . His immense frame was thin and angular ; his arms were inordinately long ; hands , feet and eyebrows were large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unkempt . Only the amazing , dreamful eyes , and a fineness in the texture of the skin , redeemed the face and gave it distinction. ( 3 ) Why did precise , complacent Miss Todd pick out so strange a man for her mate ? The story that she married him for ambition , divining what he was to be  --  like Jane Welsh in the conventional story of Carlyle  --  argues too much of the gift of prophecy . Whatever her motive , it is more than likely that she was what the commercialism of to-day would call an " asset . " She had certain qualities that her husband lacked . For one , she had that intuition for the main chance which shallow people confound with practical judgment . Her soul inhabited the obvious ; but within the horizon of the obvious she was shrewd , courageous and stubborn . Not any danger that Mary Lincoln would go wandering after dreams , visions , presences , such as were drifting ever in a ghostly procession at the back of her husband 's mind . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a danger that the outer life might be swamped by the inner , that the ghosts within might carry him away with them , away from fact  --  seeking-seeking . That this never occurred may be fairly credited , or at least very plausibly credited , to the firm-willed , the utterly matter-of-fact little person he had married . How far he enjoyed the mode of his safe-guarding is a fruitless speculation . Another result that may , perhaps , be due to Mary Lincoln was the improvement in his fortunes . However , this may have had no other source than a distinguished lawyer whose keen eyes had been observing him since his first appearance in politics . Stephen T. Logan " had that old-fashioned , lawyer-like morality which was keenly intolerant of any laxity or slovenliness of mind or character . " He had , " as he deserved , the reputation of being the best nisi prius lawyer in the state . " ( 4 ) After watching the gifted but ill-prepared young attorney during several years , observing the power he had of simplification and convincingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  these were ever Lincoln 's strong cards as a lawyer  --  Logan made him the surprising offer of a junior partnership , which was instantly accepted . That was when his inner horizon was brightening , shortly before his marriage . A period of great mental energy followed , about the years 1842 and 1843 . Lincoln threw himself into the task of becoming a real lawyer under Logan 's direction . However , his zeal flagged after a time , and when the partnership ended four years later he had to some extent fallen back into earlier , less strenuous habits . " He permitted his partner to do all the studying in the preparation of cases , while he himself trusted to his general knowledge of the law and the inspiration of the surroundings to overcome the judge or the jury . " ( 5 ) Though Lincoln was to undergo still another stimulation of the scholarly conscience before finding himself as a lawyer , the four years with Logan were his true student period . If the enthusiasm of the first year did not hold out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study a changed man , one who knew the difference between the learned lawyer and the unlearned . His own methods , to be sure , remained what they always continued to be , unsystematic , not to say slipshod . Even after he became president his lack of system was at times the despair of his secretaries. ( 6 ) Herndon , who succeeded Logan as his partner , and who admired both men , has a broad hint that Logan and Lincoln were not always an harmonious firm . A clash of political ambitions is part explanation ; business methods another . " Logan was scrupulously exact and used extraordinary care in the preparation of papers . His words were well chosen , and his style of composition was stately and formal . " ( 7 ) He was industrious and very thrifty , while Lincoln had " no money sense . " It must have annoyed , if it did not exasperate his learned and formal partner , when Lincoln signed the firm name to such letters as this : " As to real estate , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents , we are lawyers . We recommend that you give the charge of it to Mr. Isaac S. Britton , a trust-worthy man and one whom the Lord made on purpose for such business . " ( 8 ) Superficial observers , then and afterward , drew the conclusion that Lincoln was an idler . Long before , as a farm-hand , he had been called " bone idle . " ( 9 ) And of the outer Lincoln , except under stress of need , or in spurts of enthusiasm , as in the earlier years with Logan , this reckless comment had its base of fact . The mighty energy that was in Lincoln , a tireless , inexhaustible energy , was inward , of the spirit ; it did not always ramify into the sensibilities and inform his outer life . The connecting link of the two , his mere intelligence , though constantly obedient to demands of the outer life , was not susceptible of great strain except on demand of the spiritual vision . Hence his attitude toward the study of the law . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers  --  observation , reflection , intelligence  --  just so long as it appeared in his imagination a vast creative effort of the spiritual powers , of humanity struggling perilously to see justice done upon earth , to let reason and the will of God prevail . It lost its hold upon him the instant it became a thing of technicalities , of mere learning , of statutory dialectics . The restless , inward Lincoln , dwelling deep among spiritual shadows , found other outlets for his energy during these years when he was establishing himself at the bar . He continued to be a voracious reader . And his reading had taken a skeptical turn . Volney and Paine were now his intimates . The wave of ultra-rationalism that went over America in the ' forties did not spare many corners of the land . In Springfield , as in so many small towns , it had two effects : those who were not touched by it hardened into jealous watchfulness , and their religion naturally enough became fiercely combative ; those who responded to the new influence became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , when of serious mind , and all those who were reformers by temperament , tended to exalt the new , to patronize , if not to ridicule the old . At Springfield , as at many another frontier town wracked by its growing pains , a Young Men 's Lyceum confessed the world to be out of joint , and went to work glibly to set it right . Lincoln had contributed to its achievements . An oration of his on " Perpetuation of Our Free Institutions , " ( 10 ) a mere rhetorical " stunt " in his worst vein now deservedly forgotten , so delighted the young men that they asked to have it printed  --  quite as the same sort of young men to-day print essays on cubism , or examples of free verse read to poetry societies . Just what views he expressed on things in general among the young men and others ; how far he aired his acquaintance with the skeptics , is imperfectly known. ( 11 ) However , a rumor got abroad that he was an " unbeliever , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in religion with the person who applied it . The rumor was based in part on a passage in an address on temperance . In 1842 , Lincoln , who had always been abstemious , joined that Washington Society which aimed at a reformation in the use of alcohol . His address was delivered at the request of the society . It contained this passage , very illuminating in its light upon the generosity , the real humility of the speaker , but scarcely tactful , considering the religious susceptibility of the hour : " If they ( the Christians ) believe as they profess , that Omnipotence condescended to take on himself the form of sinful man , and as such die an ignominious death , surely they will not refuse submission to the infinitely lesser condescension for the temporal and perhaps eternal salvation of a large , erring and unfortunate class of their fellow creatures ! Nor is the condescension very great . In my judgment such of us as have never fallen victims have been spared more from the absence of appetite than from any mental or moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we take habitual drunkards as a class , their heads and their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison with those of any other class . " ( 12 ) How like that remark attributed to another great genius , one whom Lincoln in some respects resembled , the founder of Methodism , when he said of a passing drunkard : " There goes John Wesley , except for the Grace of God . " But the frontier zealots of the ' forties were not of the Wesley type . The stories of Lincoln 's skeptical interests , the insinuations which were promptly read into this temperance address , the fact that he was not a church-member , all these were seized upon by a good but very narrow man , a devoted , illiterate evangelist , Peter Cartwright . In 1846 , this religious issue became a political issue . The Whigs nominated Lincoln for Congress . It was another instance of personal politics . The local Whig leaders had made some sort of private agreement , the details of which appear to be lost , but according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was nominated without opposition . The Democrats nominated Cartwright . Two charges were brought against Lincoln : that he was an infidel , and that he was  --  of all things in the world !  --  an aristocrat . On these charges the campaign was fought . The small matter of what he would do at Washington , or would not do , was brushed aside . Personal politics with a vengeance ! The second charge Lincoln humorously and abundantly disproved ; the first , he met with silence . Remembering Lincoln 's unfailing truthfulness , remembering also his restless ambition , only one conclusion can be drawn from this silence . He could not categorically deny Cartwright 's accusation and at the same time satisfy his own unsparing conception of honesty . That there was no real truth in the charge of irreligion , the allusions in the Speed letters abundantly prove . The tone is too sincere to be doubted ; nevertheless , they give no clue to his theology . And for men like Cartwright , religion was tied up hand and foot in theology . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and from its derivatives . Though he held tenaciously to all that was mystical in her bequest to him , he rejected early its formulations . The evidence of later years reaffirms this double fact . The sense of a spiritual world behind , beyond the world of phenomena , grew on him with the years ; the power to explain , to formulate that world was denied him . He had no bent for dogma . Ethically , mystically , he was always a Christian ; dogmatically he knew not what he was . Therefore , to the challenge to prove himself a Christian on purely dogmatic grounds , he had no reply . To attempt to explain what separated him from his accusers , to show how from his point of view they were all Christian  --  although , remembering their point of view , he hesitated to say so  --  to draw the line between mysticism and emotionalism , would have resulted only in a worse confusion . Lincoln , the tentative mystic , the child of the starlit forest , was as inexplicable to Cartwright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hell  --  take your choice and be quick about it !  --  as was Lincoln the spiritual sufferer to New Salem , or Lincoln the political scientist to his friends in the Legislature . But he was not injured by his silence . The faith in him held by too many people was too well established . Then , as always thereafter , whatever he said or left unsaid , most thoughtful persons who came close to him sensed him as a religious man . That was enough for healthy , generous young Springfield . He and Cartwright might fight out their religious issues when they pleased , Abe should have his term in Congress . He was elected by a good majority. ( 14 ) @# @# VI . UNSATISFYING RECOGNITION Lincoln 's career as a Congressman , 1847-1849 , was just what might have been expected  --  his career in the Illinois Legislature on a larger scale . It was a pleasant , companionable , unfruitful episode , with no political significance . The leaders of the party did not take him seriously as a possible initiate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Whig mass . In the party strategy , during the debates over the Mexican War and the Wilmot Proviso , he did his full party duty , voting just as the others did . Only once did he attempt anything original  --  a bill to emancipate the slaves of the District , which was little more than a restatement of his protest of ten years before  --  and on this point Congress was as indifferent as the Legislature had been . The bill was denied a hearing and never came to a vote before the House. ( 1 ) And yet Lincoln did not fail entirely to make an impression at Washington . And again it was the Springfield experience repeated . His companionableness was recognized , his modesty , his good nature ; above all , his story-telling . Men liked him . Plainly it was his humor , his droll ways , that won them ; together with instant recognition of his sterling integrity . " During the Christmas holidays , " says Ben Perley Poore , " Mr. Lincoln found his way into the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a few genial reconteurs used to meet almost every morning after the mail had been distributed into the members ' boxes , to exchange such new stories as any of them might have acquired since they had last met . After modestly standing at the door for several days , Mr. Lincoln was reminded of a story , and by New Year 's he was recognized as the champion story-teller of the Capital . His favorite seat was at the left of the open fireplace , tilted back in his chair with his long legs reaching over to the chimney jamb. " ( 2 ) In the words of another contemporary , " Congressman Lincoln was very fond of howling and would frequently . . . meet other members in a match game at the alley of James Casparus . . . . He was an awkward bowler , but played the game with great zest and spirit solely for exercise and amusement , and greatly to the enjoyment and entertainment of the other players , and by reason of his criticisms and funny illustrations . . . . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would assemble numbers of people to witness the fun which was anticipated by those who knew of his fund of anecdotes and jokes . When in the alley , surrounded by a crowd of eager listeners , he indulged with great freedom in the sport of narrative , some of which were very broad . " ( 3 ) Once , at least , he entertained Congress with an exhibition of his humor , and this , oddly enough , is almost the only display of it that has come down to us , first hand . Lincoln 's humor has become a tradition . Like everything else in his outward life , it changed gradually with his slow devious evolution from the story-teller of Pigeon Creek to the author of the Gettysburg Oration . It is known chiefly through translation . The " Lincoln Stories " are stories someone else has told who may or may not have heard them told by Lincoln . They are like all translations , they express the translator not the original  --  final evidence that Lincoln 's appeal as a humorist was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His laugh was striking . Such awkward gestures belonged to no other man . They attracted universal attention from the old sedate down to the schoolboy . " ( 4 ) He was a famous mimic . Lincoln is himself the authority that he did not invent his stories . He picked them up wherever he found them , and clothed them with the peculiar drollery of his telling . He was a wag rather than a wit . All that lives in the second-hand repetitions of his stories is the mere core , the original appropriated thing from which the inimitable decoration has fallen off . That is why the collections of his stories are such dreary reading ,  --  like Carey 's Dante , or Bryant 's Homer . And strange to say , there is no humor in his letters . This man who was famous as a wag writes to his friends almost always in perfect seriousness , often sadly . The bit of humor that has been preserved in his one comic speech in Congress ,  --  a burlesque of the Democratic candidate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his manner , his tricks of speech and gesture , is hardly worth repeating. ( 5 ) Lincoln was deeply humiliated by his failure to make a serious impression at Washington. ( 6 ) His eyes opened in a startled realization that there were worlds he could not conquer . The Washington of the ' forties was far indeed from a great capital ; it was as friendly to conventional types of politician as was Springfield or Vandalia . The man who could deal in ideas as political counters , the other man who knew the subtleties of the art of graft , both these were national as well as local figures . Personal politics were also as vicious at Washington as anywhere ; nevertheless , there was a difference , and in that difference lay the secret of Lincoln 's failure . He was keen enough to grasp the difference , to perceive the clue to his failure . In a thousand ways , large and small , the difference came home to him . It may all be symbolized by a closing detail of his stay . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the list of managers of the Inaugural Ball of 1849 . Nothing of the sort had hitherto entered into his experience . As Mrs. Lincoln was not with him he joined " a small party of mutual friends " who attended the ball together . As one of them relates , " he was greatly interested in all that was to be seen and we did not take our departure until three or four o'clock in the morning . " ( 7 ) What an ironic picture  --  this worthy provincial , the last word for awkwardness , socially as strange to such a scene as a little child , spending the whole night gazing intently at everything he could see , at the barbaric display of wealth , the sumptuous gowns , the brilliant uniforms , the distinguished foreigners , and the leaders of America , men like Webster and Clay , with their air of assured power , the men he had failed to impress . This was his valedictory at Washington . He went home and told Herndon that he had committed political suicide. ( 8 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong for him . And yet , what was wrong ? He had been popular at Washington , in the same way in which he had been popular at Springfield . Why had the same sort of success inspired him at Springfield and humiliated him at Washington ? The answer was in the difference between the two worlds . Companionableness , story-telling , at Springfield , led to influence ; at Washington it led only to applause . At Springfield it was a means ; at Washington it was an end . The narrow circle gave the good fellow an opportunity to reveal at his leisure everything else that was in him ; the larger circle ruthlessly put him in his place as a good fellow and nothing more . The truth was that in the Washington of the ' forties , neither the inner nor the outer Lincoln could by itself find lodgment . Neither the lonely mystical thinker nor the captivating buffoon could do more than ripple its surface . As superficial as Springfield , it lacked Springfield 's impulsive generosity . To the long record of its obtuseness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a great man and it had no eyes to see . It was destined to repeat the performance . And so Lincoln came home , disappointed , disillusioned . He had not succeeded in establishing the slightest claim , either upon the country or his party . Without such claim he had no ground for attempting reelection . The frivolity of the Whig machine in the Sangamon region was evinced by their rotation agreement . Out of such grossly personal politics Lincoln had gone to Washington ; into this essentially corrupt system he relapsed . He faced , politically , a blank wall . And he had within him as yet , no consciousness of any power that might cleave the wall asunder . What was he to do next ? At this dangerous moment  --  so plainly the end of a chapter  --  he was offered the governorship of the new Territory of Oregon . For the first time he found himself at a definite parting of the ways , where a sheer act of will was to decide things ; where the pressure of circumstance was of secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of him appeared . The inheritance from his mother , from the forest , had always been obvious . But , after all , he was the son not only of Nancy and of the lonely stars , but also of shifty , drifty Thomas the unstable . If it was not his paternal inheritance that revived in him at this moment of confessed failure , it was something of the same sort . Just as Thomas had always by way of extricating himself from a failure taken to the road , now Abraham , at a psychological crisis , felt the same wanderlust , and he threatened to go adrift . Some of his friends urged him to accept . " You will capture the new community , " said they , " and when Oregon becomes a State , you will go to Washington as its first Senator . " What a glorified application of the true Thomasian line of thought . Lincoln hesitated  --  hesitated  --  And then the forcible little lady who had married him put her foot down . Go out to that far-away backwoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world ; when real prosperity at Springfield was surely within their grasp ; when they were at last becoming people of importance , who should be able to keep their own carriage ? Not much ! Her husband declined the appointment and resumed the practice of law in Springfield. ( 9 ) @# @# VII . THE SECOND START Stung by his failure at Washington , Lincoln for a time put his whole soul into the study of the law . He explained his failure to himself as a lack of mental training. ( 1 ) There followed a repetition of his early years with Logan , but with very much more determination , and with more abiding result . In those days in Illinois , as once in England , the judges held court in a succession of towns which formed a circuit . Judge and lawyers moved from town to town , " rode the circuit " in company ,  --  sometimes on horseback , sometimes in their own vehicles , sometimes by stage . Among the reminiscences of Lincoln on the circuit , are his " poky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many and many a mile , round and round the Eighth Judicial Circuit , he traveled in that humble style . What thoughts he brooded on in his lonely drives , he seldom told . During this period the cloud over his inner life is especially dense . The outer life , in a multitude of reminiscences , is well known . One of its salient details was the large proportion of time he devoted to study . " Frequently , I would go out on the circuit with him , " writes Herndon . " We , usually , at the little country inn , occupied the same bed . In most cases , the beds were too short for him and his feet would hang over the footboard , thus exposing a limited expanse of shin bone . Placing his candle at the head of his bed he would read and study for hours . I have known him to stay in this position until two o'clock in the morning . Meanwhile , I and others who chanced to occupy the same room would be safely and soundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he studied Euclid until he could with ease demonstrate all the propositions in the six books . How he could maintain his equilibrium or concentrate his thoughts on an abstract mathematical problem , while Davis , Logan , Swett , Edwards and I , so industriously and volubly filled the air with our interminable snoring , was a problem none of , us  --  could ever solve . " ( 2 ) A well-worn copy of Shakespeare was also his constant companion . He rose rapidly in the profession ; and this in spite of his incorrigible lack of system . The mechanical side of the lawyer 's task , now , as in the days with Logan , annoyed him ; he left the preparation of papers to his junior partner , as formerly he left it to his senior partner . But the situation had changed in a very important way . In Herndon , Lincoln had for a partner a talented young man who looked up to him , almost adored him , who was quite willing to be his man Friday . Fortunately , for all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was not disturbed by his grotesque or absurd sides . " He was proverbially careless as to his habits , " Herndon writes . " In a letter to a fellow lawyer in another town , apologizing for his failure to answer sooner , he explains : ' First , I have been very busy in the United States Court ; second , when I received the letter , I put it in my old hat , and buying a new one the next day , the old one was set aside , so the letter was lost sight of for the time . ' This hat of Lincoln 's  --  a silk plug  --  was an extraordinary receptacle . It was his desk and his memorandum book . In it he carried his bank-book and the bulk of his letters . Whenever in his reading or researches , he wished to preserve an idea , he jotted it down on an envelope or stray piece of paper and placed it inside the lining ; afterwards , when the memorandum was needed , there was only one place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessing that their office was very dirty . So neglected was it that a young man of neat habits who entered the office as a law student under Lincoln could not refrain from cleaning it up , and the next visitor exclaimed in astonishment , " What 's happened here ! " ( 3 ) " The office , " says that same law student , " was on the second floor of a brick building on the public square opposite the courthouse . You went up a flight of stairs and then passed along a hallway to the rear office which was a medium sized room . There was one long table in the center of the room , and a shorter one running in the opposite direction forming a T and both were covered with green baize . There were two windows which looked into the back yard . In one corner was an old-fashioned secretary with pigeonholes and a drawer ; and here Mr. Lincoln and his partner kept their law papers . There was also a bookcase containing about two hundred volumes of law and miscellaneous books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no order in the office at all . " Lincoln left all the money matters to Herndon . " He never entered an item on the account book . If a fee was paid to him and Herndon was not there , he would divide the money , wrap up one part in paper and place it in his partner 's desk with the inscription , ' Case of Roe versus Doe , Herndon 's half . ' He had an odd habit of reading aloud much to his partner 's annoyance . He talked incessantly ; a whole forenoon would sometimes go by while Lincoln occupied the whole time telling stories . " ( 4 ) On the circuit , his story-telling was an institution . Two other men , long since forgotten , vied with him as rival artists in humorous narrative . These three used to hold veritable tournaments . Herndon has seen " the little country tavern where these three were wont to meet after an adjournment of court , crowded almost to suffocation , with an audience of men who had gathered to witness the contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the town , all the lawyers , and not infrequently a preacher , could be found in the crowd that filled the doors and windows . The yarns they spun and the stories they told would not bear repetition here , but many of them had morals which , while exposing the weakness of mankind , stung like a whiplash . Some were , no doubt , a thousand years old , with just enough of verbal varnish and alterations of names and date to make them new and crisp . By virtue of the last named application , Lincoln was enabled to draw from Balzac a ' droll story ' and locating it ' in Egypt ' ( Southern Illinois ) or in Indiana , pass it off for a purely original conception . . . I have seen Judge Treat , who was the very impersonation of gravity itself , sit up till the last and laugh until , as he often expressed it , ' he almost shook his ribs loose . ' The next day he would ascend the bench and listen to Lincoln in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge in wig and gown . " ( 5 ) Lincoln enjoyed the life on the circuit . It was not that he was always in a gale of spirits ; a great deal of the time he brooded . His Homeric nonsense alternated with fits of gloom . In spite of his late hours , whether of study or of story-telling , he was an early riser . " He would sit by the fire having uncovered the coals , and muse and ponder and soliloquize. " ( 6 ) Besides his favorite Shakespeare , he had a fondness for poetry of a very different sort  --  Byron , for example . And he never tired of a set of stanzas in the minor key beginning : " Oh , why should the spirit of mortal be proud ? " ( 7 ) The hilarity of the circuit was not by any means the whole of its charm for him . Part of that charm must have been the contrast with his recent failure at Washington . This world he could master . Here his humor increased his influence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judges , jury and the bar . Then , too , it was a man 's world . Though Lincoln had a profound respect for women , he seems generally to have been ill at ease in their company . In what his friends would have called " general society " he did not shine . He was too awkward , too downright , too lacking in the niceties . At home , though he now owned a house and was making what seemed to him plenty of money , he was undoubtedly a trial to Mrs. Lincoln 's sense of propriety . He could not rise with his wife , socially . He was still what he had become so long before , the favorite of all the men  --  good old Abe Lincoln that you could tie to though it rained cats and dogs . But as to the ladies ! Fashionable people calling on Mrs. Lincoln , had been received by her husband in his shirt-sleeves , and he totally unabashed , as oblivious of discrepancy as if he were a nobleman and not a nobody. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known at table to put his own knife into the butter . How safe to assume that many things were said commiserating poor Mrs. Lincoln who had a bear for a husband . And some people noticed that Lincoln did not come home at week-ends during term-time as often as he might . Perhaps it meant something ; perhaps it did not . But there could be no doubt that the jovial itinerant life of the circuit was the life for him  --  at least in the early ' fifties . That it was , and also that he was becoming known as a lawyer , is evinced by his refusal of a flattering invitation to enter a prosperous firm in Chicago . Out of all this came a deepening of his power to reach and impress men through words . The tournament of the story-tellers was a lawyers ' tournament . The central figure was reading , studying , thinking , as never in his life before . Though his fables remained as broad as ever , the merely boisterous character ceased to predominate . The ethical bent of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what they remembered chiefly of his stories was not the broad part of them , but the moral that was in them. ( 9 ) And they had no squeamishness as critics of the art of fable-making . His ethical sense of things , his companionableness , the utterly non-censorious cast of his mind , his power to evolve yarns into parables  --  all these made him irresistible with a jury . It was a saying of his : " If I can divest this case of technicalities and swing it to the jury , I 'll win it . " ( 10 ) But there was not a trace in him of that unscrupulousness usually attributed to the " jury lawyer . " Few things show more plainly the central unmovableness of his character than his immunity to the lures of jury speaking . To use his power over an audience for his own enjoyment , for an interested purpose , for any purpose except to afford pleasure , or to see justice done , was for him constitutionally impossible . Such a performance was beyond the reach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious as it was , was also the last word for simplicity , a terrible simplicity . The exercise of his singular powers was irrevocably conditioned on his own faith in the moral justification of what he was doing . He had no patience with any conception of the lawyer 's function that did not make him the devoted instrument of justice . For the law as a game , for legal strategy , he felt contempt . Never under any conditions would he attempt to get for a client more than he was convinced the client in justice ought to have . The first step in securing his services was always to persuade him that one 's cause was just He sometimes threw up a case in open court because the course of it had revealed deception on the part of the client . At times he expressed his disdain of the law 's mere commercialism in a stinging irony . " In a closely contested civil suit , " writes his associate , Ward Hill Lamon , " Lincoln proved an account for his client , who was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very slippery fellow . The opposing attorney then proved a receipt clearly covering the entire cause of action . By the time he was through Lincoln was missing . The court sent for him to the hotel . ' Tell the Judge , ' said he , ' that I ca n't come ; my hands are dirty and I came over to clean them . ' " ( 11 ) " Discourage litigation , " he wrote . " Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can . Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser , in fees , expenses , and waste of time . As a peacemaker , the lawyer has a Superior Opportunity of being a good man . There will still be business enough . " ( 12 ) He held his moral and professional views with the same inflexibility with which he held his political views . Once he had settled upon a conviction or an opinion , nothing could move him . He was singularly stubborn , and yet , in all the minor matters of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except his basal ideas , he was pliable to a degree . He could be talked into almost any concession of interest . He once told Herndon he thanked God that he had not been born a woman because he found it so hard to refuse any request made of him . His outer easiness , his lack of self-assertion ,  --  as most people understand self-assertion ,  --  persist in an amusing group of anecdotes of the circuit . Though he was a favorite with the company at every tavern , those little demagogues , the tavern-keepers , quickly found out that he could be safely put upon . In the minute but important favoritism of tavern life , in the choice of rooms , in the assignment of seats at table , in the distribution of delicacies , easy-going Lincoln was ever the first one to be ignored . " He never complained of the food , bed , or lodgings , " says a judge of the circuit , David Davis . " If every other fellow grumbled at the bill of fare which greeted us at many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 13 ) But his complacency was of the surface only . His ideas were his own . He held to them with dogged tenacity . Herndon was merely the first of several who discerned on close familiarity Lincoln 's inward inflexibility . " I was never conscious , " he writes , " of having made much of an impression on Mr. Lincoln , nor do I believe I ever changed his views . I will go further and say that from the profound nature of his conclusions and the labored method by which he arrived at them , no man is entitled to the credit of having either changed or greatly modified them . " ( 14 ) In these years of the early ' fifties , Herndon had much occasion to test his partner 's indifference to other men 's views , his tenacious adherence to his own . Herndon had become an Abolitionist . He labored to convert Lincoln ; but it was a lost labor . The Sphinx in a glimmer of sunshine was as unassailable as the cheery , fable-loving , inflexible Lincoln . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ardor , warn Lincoln against his apparent conservatism when the needs of the hour were so great ; but his only answer would be , " Billy , you are too rampant and spontaneous . " ( 15 ) Nothing could move him from his fixed conviction that the temper of Abolitionism made it pernicious . He persisted in classifying it with slavery ,  --  both of equal danger to free institutions . He took occasion to reassert this belief in the one important utterance of a political nature that commemorates this period . An oration on the death of Henry Clay , contains the sentence : " Cast into life when slavery was already widely spread and deeply sealed , he did not perceive , as I think no wise man has perceived , how it could be at once eradicated without producing a greater evil even to the cause of human liberty itself . " ( 16 ) It will be remembered that the Abolitionists were never strongly national in sentiment . In certain respects they remind one of the extreme " internationals " of to-day . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to governments , but to abstract ideas . For all such attitudes in political science , Lincoln had an instinctive aversion . He was permeated always , by his sense of the community , of the obligation to work in terms of the community . Even the prejudices , the shortsightedness of the community were things to be considered , to be dealt with tenderly . Hence his unwillingness to force reforms upon a community not ripe to receive them . In one of his greatest speeches occurs the dictum : " A universal feeling whether well or ill-founded , can not be safely disregarded . " ( 17 ) Anticipating such ideas , he made in his Clay oration , a startling denunciation of both the extreme factions of " Those ( Abolitionists ) who would shiver into fragments the union of these States , tear to tatters its now ' venerated Constitution , and even burn the last copy of the Bible rather than slavery should continue a single hour ; together with all their more halting sympathizers , have received and are receiving their just execration ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully and , as I trust , effectually and enduringly arrayed against them . But I would also if I could , array his name , opinion and influence against the opposite extreme , against a few , but increasing number of men who , for the sake of perpetuating slavery , are beginning to assail and ridicule the white man 's charter of freedom , the declaration that ' all men are created free and equal . ' " ( 18 ) In another passage he stated what he conceived to be the central inspiration of Clay . Had he been thinking of himself , he could not have foreshadowed more exactly the basal drift of all his future as a statesman : " He loved his country partly because it was his own country , and mostly because it was a free country ; and he burned with a zeal for its advancement , prosperity , and glory , because he saw in such the advancement , prosperity and glory of human liberty , human right and human nature . " ( 19 ) @# @# VIII . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Washington . They centered about a remarkable man with whom Lincoln had hitherto formed a curious parallel , by whom hitherto he had been completely overshadowed . Stephen Arnold Douglas was prosecuting attorney at Springfield when Lincoln began the practice of law . They were in the Legislature together . Both courted Mary Todd . Soon afterward , Douglas had distanced his rival . When Lincoln went to the House of Representatives as a Whig , Douglas went to the Senate as a Democrat . While Lincoln was failing at Washington , Douglas was building a national reputation . In the hubbub that followed the Compromise of 1850 , while Lincoln , abandoning politics , immersed himself in the law , Douglas rendered a service to the country by defeating a movement in Illinois to reject the Compromise . When the Democratic National Convention assembled in 1852 , he was sufficiently prominent to obtain a considerable vote for the presidential nomination . The dramatic contrast of these two began with their physical appearance . Douglas was so small that he had been known to sit on a friend 's knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his indomitable force of character , made up for his tiny proportions . " The Little Giant " was a term of endearment applied to him by his followers . The mental contrast was equally marked . Scarcely a quality in Lincoln that was not reversed in Douglas  --  deliberation , gradualness , introspection , tenacity , were the characteristics of Lincoln 's mind . The mind of Douglas was first of all facile . He was extraordinarily quick . In political Strategy he could sense a new situation , wheel to meet it , throw overboard well-established plans , devise new ones , all in the twinkle of an eye . People who could not understand such rapidity of judgment pronounced him insincere , or at least , an opportunist . That he did not have the deep inflexibility of Lincoln may be assumed ; that his convictions , such as they were , did not have an ethical cast may be safely asserted . Nevertheless , he was a great force , an immense human power , that did not change its course without good reason of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he summed up a change that was coming over the Democratic party . Janus-like , he had two faces , one for his constituents , one for his colleagues . To the voter he was still a Jeffersonian , with whom the old phraseology of the party , liberty , equality , and fraternity , were still the catch-words . To his associates in the Senate he was essentially an aristocrat , laboring to advance interests that were careless of the rights of man . A later age has accused the Senate of the United States of being the citadel of Big Business . Waiving the latter view , the historian may assert that something suggestive of Big Business appeared in our politics in the ' fifties , and was promptly made at home in the Senate . Perhaps its first definite manifestation was a new activity on the part of the great slave-holders . To invoke again the classifications of later points of view , certain of our historians to-day think they can see in the ' fifties a virtual slavery trust , a combine of slave interests controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real , though informal , an existence as has the Steel Trust or the Beef Trust in our own time . This powerful interest allied itself with the capitalists of the Northeast . In modern phraseology , they aimed to " finance " the slave interest from New York . And for a time the alliance succeeded in doing this . The South went entirely upon credit . It bought and borrowed heavily in the East New York furnished the money . Had there been nothing further to consider , the invasion of the Senate by Big Business in the ' fifties might not have taken place . But there was something else . Slavery 's system of agriculture was excessively wasteful . To be highly profitable it required virgin soil , and the financial alliance demanded high profits . Early in the ' fifties , the problem of Big Business was the acquisition of fresh soil for slavery . The problem entered politics with the question how could this be brought about without appearing to contradict democracy ? The West also had its incipient Big Business . It hinged upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steady stream of migration westward , with all America dazzled more or less by gold-mines and Pacific trade , a transcontinental railway was a Western dream . But what course should it take , what favored regions were to become its immediate beneficiaries ? Here was a chance for great jockeying among business interests in Congress , for slave-holders , money-lenders , railway promoters to manipulate deals to their hearts ' content . They had been doing so amid a high complication of squabbling , while Douglas was traveling in Europe during 1853 . When he returned late in the year , the unity of the Democratic machine in Congress was endangered by these disputes . Douglas at once attacked the problem of party harmony . He threw himself into the task with all his characteristic quickness , all his energy and resourcefulness . By this time the problem contained five distinct factors : The upper Northeast wanted a railroad starting at Chicago . The Central West wanted a road from St. Louis . The Southwest wanted a road from New Orleans , or at least , the frustration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for slavery . The Compromise of 1850 stood in the way of the extension of slave territory . If Douglas had had any serious convictions opposed to slavery the last of the five factors would have brought him to a standstill . Fortunately for him as a party strategist , he was indifferent . Then , too , he firmly believed that slavery could never thrive in the West because of climatic conditions . " Man might propose , but physical geography would dispose . " ( 1 ) On both counts it seemed to him immaterial what concessions be made to slavery extension northwestward . Therefore , he dismissed this consideration and applied himself to the harmonization of the four business factors involved . The result was a famous compromise inside a party . His Kansas-Nebraska Bill created two new territories , one lying westward from Chicago ; one lying westward from St. Louis . It also repealed the Missouri Compromise and gave the inhabitants of each territory the right to decide for themselves whether or not slavery should be permitted in their midst . That is to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it extended equal governmental protection , but it promised favors to none , and left each faction to rise or fall in the free competition of private enterprise . Why  --  was not this , remembering Douglas 's assumptions , a master-stroke ? He had expected , of course , denunciation by the Abolitionists . He considered it immaterial . But he was not in the least prepared for what happened . A storm burst . It was fiercest in his own State . " Traitor , " " Arnold , " " Judas , " were the pleasant epithets fired at him in a bewildering fusillade . He could not understand it . Something other than mere Abolitionism had been aroused by his great stroke . But what was it ? Why did men who were not Abolitionists raise a hue and cry ? Especially , why did many Democrats do so ? Amazed , puzzled , but as always furiously valiant , Douglas hurried home to join battle with his assailants . He entered on a campaign of speech-making . On October 3 , 1854 , he spoke at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular speaker they could find , chose Lincoln . The next day he replied to Douglas . The Kansas-Nebraska Bill had not affected any change in Lincoln 's thinking . His steady , consistent development as a political thinker had gone on chiefly in silence ever since his Protest seventeen years before . He was still intolerant of Abolitionism , still resolved to leave slavery to die a natural death in the States where it was established . He defended the measure which most offended the Abolitionists , the Fugitive Slave Law . He had appeared as counsel for a man who claimed a runaway slave as his property. ( 2 ) None the less , the Kansas-Nebraska Bill had brought him to his feet , wheeled him back from law into politics , begun a new chapter . The springs of action in is case were the factor which Douglas had overlooked , which in all his calculations he had failed to take into account , which was destined to destroy him . Lincoln , no less than Douglas , had sensed the fact that money was becoming a power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended to become allies with the inevitable result of a shift of gravity in the American social system . " Humanity " had once been the American shibboleth ; it was giving place to a new shibboleth- " prosperity . " And the people who were to control and administer prosperity were the rich . The rights of man were being superseded by the rights of wealth . Because of its place in this new coalition of non-democratic influences , slavery , to Lincoln 's mind , was assuming a new role , " beginning , " as he had said , in the Clay oration , " to assail and ridicule the white man 's charter of freedom , the declaration that ' all men are created free and equal . ' " That phrase , " the white man 's charter of freedom , " had become Lincoln 's shibboleth . Various utterances and written fragments of the summer of 1854 , reveal the intensity of his preoccupation . " Equality in society beats inequality , whether the latter be of the British aristocratic sort or of the domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove , however conclusively , that he may of right enslave B , why may not B snatch the same argument and prove equally that he may enslave A ? You say A is white and B is black . It is color then ; the lighter having the right to enslave the darker ? Take care . By this rule you are to be slave to the first man you meet with a fairer skin than your own . You do not mean color exactly ? You mean the whites are intellectually the superiors of the blacks , and therefore have the right to enslave them ? Take care again . By this rule you are to be slave to the first man you meet with an intellect superior to your own . But , you say , it is a question of interest , and if you make it your interest , you have the right to enslave another . Very well . And if he can make it his interest , he has the right to enslave you . " ( 4 ) Speaking of slavery to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most glittering , ostentatious , and displaying property in the world ; and now , if a young man goes courting , the only inquiry is how many negroes he or his lady love owns . The love of slave property is swallowing up every other mercenary possession . Its ownership betokened not only the possession of wealth , but indicated the gentleman of leisure who was above and scorned labor . " ( 5 ) It was because of these views , because he saw slavery allying itself with the spread of plutocratic ideals , that Lincoln entered the battle to prevent its extension . He did so in his usual cool , determined way . Though his first reply to Douglas was not recorded , his second , made at Peoria twelve days later , still exists. ( 6 ) It is a landmark in his career . It sums up all his long , slow development in political science , lays the abiding foundation of everything he thought thereafter . In this great speech , the end of his novitiate , he rings the changes on the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension of slavery tends to discredit republican institutions , and to disappoint " the Liberal party throughout the world . " The heart of his argument is : " Whether slavery shall go into Nebraska or other new Territories is not a matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there . The whole nation is interested that the best use shall be made of these Territories . We want them for homes for free white people . This they can not be to any considerable extent , if slavery shall be planted within them . Slave States are places for poor white people to remove from , not remove to . New Free States are the places for poor people to go to and better their condition . For this use the nation needs these Territories . " The speech was a masterpiece of simplicity , of lucidity . It showed the great jury ; lawyer at his best . Its temper was as admirable as its logic ; not a touch of anger nor of vituperation . " I have no prejudice against the Southern people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be in their situation . If slavery did not exist among them , they would not introduce it . If it did now exist among us , we should not instantly give it up . This I believe of the masses North and South . " When Southern people tell us that they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we are , I acknowledge the fact . When it is said that the institution exists and that it is very difficult to get rid of in any satisfactory way , I can understand and appreciate the saying . I surely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself . If all earthly power were given me , I should not know what to do as to the existing institution . " His instinctive aversion to fanaticism found expression in a plea for the golden mean in politics . " Some men , mostly Whigs , who condemn the repeal of the Missouri Compromise , nevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration lest they be thrown in company with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whig , to tell them good-humoredly that I think this is very silly . Stand with anybody that stands right . Stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong . Stand with the Abolitionist in restoring the Missouri Compromise , and stand against him when he attempts to repeal the Fugitive Slave Law . In the latter case you stand with the Southern dis-unionist . What of that ? You are still right . In both cases you are right . In both cases you expose the dangerous extremes . In both you stand on middle ground and hold the ship level and steady . In both you are national , and nothing less than national . This is the good old Whig ground . To desert such ground because of any company is to be less than a Whig-less than a man-less than an American . " These two speeches against Douglas made an immense impression Byron-like , Lincoln waked up and found himself famous . Thereupon , his ambition revived . A Senator was to be chosen that autumn . Why might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress ? Shortly after the Peoria speech , he was sending out notes like this to prominent politicians : " Dear Sir : You used to express a good deal of partiality for me , and if you are still so , now is the time . Some friends here are really for me for the United States Senate , and I should be very grateful if you could make a mark for me among your members ( of the Legislature ) . " ( 7 ) When the Legislature assembled , it was found to comprise four groups : the out-and-out Democrats who would stand by Douglas through thick and thin , and vote only for his nominee ; the bolting Democrats who would not vote for a Douglas man , but whose party rancor was so great that they would throw their votes away rather than give them to a Whig ; such enemies of Douglas as were willing to vote for a Whig ; the remainder . The Democrats supported Governor Matteson ; the candidate of the second group was Lyman Trumbull ; the Whigs supported Lincoln . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trumbull thirty-five , Lincoln fifteen . As the bolting Democrats were beyond compromise , Lincoln determined to sacrifice himself in order to defeat Matteson . Though the fifteen protested against deserting him , he required them to do so . On the tenth ballot , they transferred their votes to Trumbull and he was elected. ( 8 ) Douglas had met his first important defeat . His policy had been repudiated in his own State . And it was Lincoln who had formulated the argument against him , who had held the balance of power , and had turned the scale . @# @# IX . THE LITERARY STATESMAN Lincoln had found at last a mode and an opportunity for concentrating all his powers in a way that could have results . He had discovered himself as a man of letters . The great speeches of 1854 were not different in a way from the previous speeches that were without results . And yet they were wholly different . Just as Lincoln 's version of an old tale made of that tale a new thing , so Lincoln 's version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's versions . The oratory of 1854 was not state-craft in any ordinary sense . It was art Lincoln the artist , who had slowly developed a great literary faculty , had chanced after so many rebuffs on good fortune . His cause stood in urgent need of just what he could give . It was one of those moments when a new political force , having not as yet any opening for action , finds salvation in the phrase-maker , in the literary artist who can embody it in words . During the next five years and more , Lincoln was the recognized offset to Douglas . His fame spread from Illinois in both directions . He was called to Iowa and to Ohio as the advocate of all advocates who could undo the effect of Douglas . His fame traveled eastward . The culmination of the period of literary leadership was his famous speech at Cooper Union in February , 1860 . It was inevitable that he should go along with the antislavery coalition which adopted the name of the Republican party . But his natural deliberation kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its founders to appropriate him after the triumph at Springfield , in October , 1854 , met with a rebuff. ( 1 ) Nearly a year and a half went by before he affiliated himself with the new party . But once having made up his mind , he went forward wholeheartedly . At the State Convention of Illinois Republicans in 1856 he made a speech that has not been recorded but which is a tradition for moving oratory . That same year a considerable number of votes were cast for Lincoln for Vice-President in the Republican National Convention . But all these were mere details . The great event of the years between 1854 and 1860 was his contest with Douglas . It was a battle of wits , a great literary duel . Fortunately for Lincoln , his part was played altogether on his own soil , under conditions in which he was entirely at his ease , where nothing conspired with his enemy to embarrass him . Douglas had a far more difficult task . Unforeseen complications rapidly forced him to change his policy , to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible years when fierce events followed one another in quick succession  --  the rush of both slave-holders and abolitionists into Kansas ; the cruel war along the Wakarusa River ; the sack of Lawrence by the pro-slavery party ; the massacre by John Brown at Pottawatomie ; the diatribes of Sumner in the Senate ; the assault on Sumner by Brooks . In the midst of this carnival of ferocity came the Dred Scott decision , cutting under the Kansas-Nebraska Bill , denying to the people of a Territory the right to legislate on slavery , and giving to all slave-holders the right to settle with their slaves anywhere they pleased outside a Free State . This famous decision repudiated Douglas 's policy of leaving all such questions to local autonomy and to private enterprise . For a time Douglas made no move to save his policy . But when President Buchanan decided to throw the influence of the Administration on the side of the pro-slavery party in Kansas , Douglas was up in arms . When it was proposed to admit Kansas with a constitution favoring slavery , but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants , Douglas voted with the Republicans to defeat admission . Whereupon the Democratic party machine and the Administration turned upon him without mercy . He stood alone in a circle of enemies . At no other time did he show so many of the qualities of a great leader . Battling with Lincoln in the popular forum on the one hand , he was meeting daily on the other assaults by a crowd of brilliant opponents in Congress . At the same time he was playing a consummate game of political strategy , struggling against immense odds to recover his hold on Illinois . The crisis would come in 1858 when he would have to go before the Legislature for reelection . He knew well enough who his opponent would be . At every turn there fell across his path the shadow of a cool sinister figure , his relentless enemy . It was Lincoln . On the struggle with Lincoln his whole battle turned . Abandoned by his former allies , his one hope was the retention of his constituency . To discredit Lincoln , to twist and discredit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and death . He struck frequently with great force , but sometimes with more fury than wisdom . Many a time the unruffled coolness of Lincoln brought to nothing what was meant for a deadly thrust . Douglas took counsel of despair and tried to show that Lincoln was preaching the amalgamation of the white and black races . " I protest , " Lincoln replied , " against the counterfeit logic which says that because I do not want a black woman for a slave , I must necessarily want her for a wife . I need not have her for either . I can just leave her alone . In some respects she certainly is not my equal ; but in her natural right to eat the bread she earns with her own hands without asking leave of any one else , she is my equal and the equal of all others . " ( 2 ) Any false move made by Douglas , any rash assertion , was sure to be seized upon by that watchful enemy in Illinois . In attempting to defend himself on two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic machine , Douglas made his reckless declaration that all he wanted was a fair vote by the people of Kansas ; that for himself he did not care how they settled the matter , whether slavery was voted up or voted down . With relentless skill , Lincoln developed the implications of this admission , drawing forth from its confessed indifference to the existence of slavery , a chain of conclusions that extended link by link to a belief in reopening the African slave trade . This was done in his speech accepting the Republican nomination for the Senate . In the same speech he restated his general position in half a dozen sentences that became at once a classic statement for the whole Republican party : " A house divided against itself can not stand . I believe this government can not endure permanently half slave and half free . I do not expect the Union to be dissolved . I do not expect the house to fall , but I do expect it will cease to be divided . It will become all one thing or all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction ; or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States , old as well as new , North as well as South . " ( 3 ) The great duel was rapidly approaching its climax . What was in reality no more than the last round has appropriated a label that ought to have a wider meaning and is known as the Lincoln-Douglas Debates . The two candidates made a joint tour of the State , debating their policies in public at various places during the summer and autumn of 1858 . Properly considered , these famous speeches closed Lincoln 's life as an orator . The Cooper Union speech was an isolated aftermath in alien conditions , a set performance not quite in his true vein . His brief addresses of the later years were incidental ; they had no combative element . Never again was he to attempt to sway an audience for an immediate stake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief description of Mr. Lincoln 's appearance on the stump and of his manner when speaking , " as Herndon aptly remarks , " may not be without interest . When standing erect , he was six feet four inches high . He was lean in flesh and ungainly in figure . Aside from his sad , pained look , due to habitual melancholy , his face had no characteristic or fixed expression . He was thin through the chest and hence slightly stoop-shouldered . . . . At first he was very awkward and it seemed a real labor to adjust himself to his surroundings . He struggled for a time under a feeling of apparent diffidence and sensitiveness , and these only added to his awkwardness .... When he began speaking his voice was shrill , piping and unpleasant . His manner , his attitude , his dark yellow face , wrinkled and dry , his oddity of pose , his diffident movements ; everything seemed to be against him , but only for a short time . . . . As he proceeded , he became somewhat more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much with his hands as with his head . He used the latter frequently , throwing it with him , this way and that . . . . He never sawed the air nor rent space into tatters and rags , as some orators do . He never acted for stage effect . He was cool , considerate , reflective  --  in time , self-possessed and self-reliant . . . . As he moved along in his speech he became freer and less uneasy in his movements ; to that extent he was graceful . He had a perfect naturalness , a strong individuality , and to that extent he was dignified . . . . He spoke with effectiveness  --  and to move the judgment as well as the emotion of men . There was a world of meaning and emphasis in the long , bony finger of the right hand as he dotted the ideas on the minds of his hearers . . . . He always stood squarely on his feet . . . . He neither touched nor leaned on anything for support . He never ranted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . As he proceeded with his speech , the exercise of his vocal organs altered somewhat the pitch of his voice . It lost in a measure its former acute and shrilling pitch and mellowed into a more harmonious and pleasant sound . His form expanded , and notwithstanding the sunken breast , he rose up a splendid and imposing figure . . . . His little gray eyes flashed in a face aglow with the fire of his profound thoughts ; and his uneasy movements and diffident manner sunk themselves beneath the wave of righteous indignation that came sweeping over him . " ( 4 ) A wonderful dramatic contrast were these two men , each in his way so masterful , as they appeared in the famous debates . By good fortune we have a portrait of Douglas the orator , from the pen of Mrs. Stowe , who had observed him with reluctant admiration from the gallery of the Senate . " This Douglas is the very ideal of vitality . Short , broad , thick-set , every inch of him has its own alertness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , heavy black brows , and a keen face . His figure would be an unfortunate one were it not for the animation that constantly pervades it . As it is it rather gives poignancy to his peculiar appearance ; he has a small handsome hand , moreover , and a graceful as well as forcible mode of using it . . . . He has two requisites of a debater , a melodious voice and clear , sharply defined enunciation . His forte in debating is his power of mystifying the point . With the most offhand assured airs in the world , and a certain appearance of honest superiority , like one who has a regard for you and wishes to set you right on one or two little matters , he proceeds to set up some point which is not that in question , but only a family connection of it , and this point he attacks with the very best of logic and language ; he charges upon it , horse and foot , runs it down , tramples it in the dust , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument . Did I not tell you so ? You see it is all stuff . ' And if you have allowed yourself to be so dazzled by his quickness as to forget that the routed point is not , after all , the one in question , you suppose all is over with it . Moreover , he contrives to mingle up so many stinging allusions , so many piquant personalities , that by the time he has done his mystification , a dozen others are ready and burning to spring on their feet to repel some direct or indirect attack all equally wide of the point . " The mode of travel of the two contestants heightened the contrast . George B. McClellan , a young engineer officer who had recently resigned from the army and was now general superintendent of the Illinois Central Railroad , gave Douglas his private car and a special train . Lincoln traveled any way he could-in ordinary passenger trains , or even in the caboose of a freight train . A curious symbolization of Lincoln 's belief that the real conflict was between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not develop new ideas . It was a literary duel , each leader aiming to restate himself in the most telling , popular way . For once that superficial definition of art applied : " What oft was thought but ne'er so well expressed . " Nevertheless the debates contained an incident that helped to make history . Though Douglas was at war with the Administration , it was not certain that the quarrel might not be made up . There was no other leader who would be so formidable at the head of a reunited Democratic party . Lincoln pondered the question , how could the rift between Douglas and the Democratic machine be made irrevocable ? And now a new phase of Lincoln appeared . It was the political strategist He saw that if he would disregard his own chance of election-as he had done from a simpler motive four years before  --  he could drive Douglas into a dilemma from which there was no real escape . He confided his purpose to his friends ; they urged him not to do it . But he had made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the silence of his own thoughts , and once having made it up , he was inflexible . At Freeport , Lincoln made the move which probably lost him the Senatorship . He asked a question which if Douglas answered it one way would enable him to recover the favor of Illinois but would lose him forever the favor of the slave-holders ; but which , if he answered it another way might enable him to make his peace at Washington but would certainly lose him Illinois . The question was : " Can the people of a United States Territory in any lawful way , against the wish of any citizen of the United States , exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution ? " ( 5 ) In other words , is the Dred Scott decision good law ? Is it true that a slave-holder can take his slaves into Kansas if the people of Kansas want to keep him out ? Douglas saw the trap . With his instantaneous facility he tried to cloud the issue and extricate himself through evasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dodging a denial of the court 's authority , he insisted that his doctrine of local autonomy was still secure because through police regulation the local legislature could foster or strangle slavery , just as they pleased , no matter " what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to the abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into a Territory under the Constitution . " As Lincoln 's friends had foreseen , this matchless performance of carrying water on both shoulders caught the popular fancy ; Douglas was reelected to the Senate . As Lincoln had foreseen , it killed him as a Democratic leader ; it prevented the reunion of the Democratic party . The result appeared in 1860 when the Republicans , though still a minority party , carried the day because of the bitter divisions among the Democrats . That was what Lincoln foresaw when he said to his fearful friends while they argued in vain to prevent his asking the question at Free-port . " I am killing larger game ; the great battle of 1860 is worth a thousand of this senatorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARK HORSE One of the most curious things in Lincoln is the way his confidence in himself came and went . He had none of Douglas 's unwavering self-reliance . Before the end , to be sure , he attained a type of self-reliance , higher and more imperturbable . But this was not the fruit of a steadfast unfolding . Rather , he was like a tree with its alternating periods of growth and pause , now richly in leaf , now dormant . Equally applicable is the other familiar image of the successive waves . The clue seems to have been , in part at least , a matter of vitality . Just as Douglas emanated vitality  --  so much so that his aura filled the whole Senate chamber and forced an unwilling response in the gifted but hostile woman who watched him from the gallery  --  Lincoln , conversely , made no such overpowering impression . His observers , however much they have to say about his humor , his seasons of Shakespearian mirth , never forget their impression that at heart he is sad . His fondness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially the line " Oh , why should the spirit of mortal be proud . " It is impossible to discover any law governing the succession of his lapses in self-reliance . But they may be related very plausibly to his sense of failure or at least to his sense of futility . He was one of those intensely sensitive natures to whom the futilities of this world are its most discouraging feature . Whenever such ideas were brought home to him his energy flagged ; his vitality , never high , sank . He was prone to turn away from the outward life to lose himself in the inner . All this is part of the phenomena which Herndon perceived more clearly than he comprehended it , which led him to call Lincoln a fatalist . A humbler but perhaps more accurate explanation is the reminder that he was son to Thomas the unstable . What happened in Lincoln 's mind when he returned defeated from Washington , that ghost-like rising of the impulses of old Thomas , recurred more than once thereafter . In fact there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a day in 1862 , during which the ghost of old Thomas is a thing to be reckoned with in his son 's life . It came and went , most of the time fortunately far on the horizon . But now and then it drew near . Always it was lurking somewhere , waiting to seize upon him in those moments when his vitality sank , when his energies were in the ebb , when his thoughts were possessed by a sense of futility . The year 1859 was one of his ebb tides . In the previous year the rising tide , which had mounted high during his success on the circuit , reached its crest The memory of his failure at Washington was effaced . At Freeport he was a more powerful genius , a more dominant personality , than he had ever been . Gradually , in the months following , the high wave subsided . During 1859 he gave most of his attention to his practice . Though political speech-making continued , and though he did not impair his reputation , he did nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value is a letter to a Boston committee that had invited him to attend a " festival " in Boston on Jefferson 's birthday . He avowed himself a thoroughgoing disciple of Jefferson and pronounced the principles of Jefferson " the definitions and axioms of free society . " Without conditions he identified his own cause with the cause of Jefferson , " the man who in the concrete pressure of a struggle for national independence by a single people , had the coolness , forecast and capacity to introduce into a merely revolutionary document , an abstract truth , applicable to all men and all times , and so to embalm it there that today and in all coming days , it shall be a rebuke and a stumbling-block to the very harbingers of reappearing tyranny and oppression . " ( 1 ) While the Boston committee were turning their eyes toward this great new phrase-maker of the West , several politicians in Illinois had formed a bold resolve . They would try to make him President . The movement had two sources  --  the personal loyalty of his devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers who saw that his duel with Douglas had made him a national figure . As one of them said to him , " Douglas being so widely known , you are getting a national reputation through him . " Lincoln replied that he did not lack the ambition but lacked altogether the confidence in the possibility of success. ( 2 ) This was his attitude during most of 1859 . The glow , the enthusiasm , of the previous year was gone . " I must in candor say that I do not think myself fit for the Presidency , " he wrote to a newspaper editor in April . He used the same words to another correspondent in July . As late as November first , he wrote , " For my single self , I have enlisted for the permanent success of the Republican cause , and for this object I shall labor faithfully in the ranks , unless , as I think not probable , the judgment of the party shall assign me a different position . " ( 3 ) Meanwhile , both groups of supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his personal following , the companionableness of twenty years had deepened into an almost romantic loyalty . The leaders of this enthusiastic attachment , most of them lawyers , had no superiors for influence in Illinois . The man who had such a following was a power in politics whether he would or no . This the mere politicians saw . They also saw that the next Republican nomination would rest on a delicate calculation of probabilities . There were other Republicans more conspicuous than Lincoln  --  Seward in New York , Sumner in Massachusetts , Chase in Ohio  --  but all these had inveterate enemies . Despite their importance would it be safe to nominate them ? Would not the party be compelled to take some relatively minor figure , some essentially new man ? In a word , what we know as a " dark horse . " Believing that this would happen , they built hopefully on their faith in Lincoln . Toward the end of the year he was at last persuaded to take his candidacy seriously . The local campaign for his nomination had gone so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of being discarded as the local Republican leader . This argument decided him . Before the year 's end he had agreed to become a candidate before the convention . In his own words , " I am not in a position where it would hurt much for me to not be nominated on the national ticket ; but I am where it would hurt some for me to not get the Illinois delegates . " ( 4 ) It was shortly after this momentous decision that he went to New York by invitation and made his most celebrated , though not in any respect his greatest , oration. ( 5 ) A large audience filled Cooper Union , February 27 , 1860 . William Cullen Bryant presided . David Dudley Field escorted Lincoln to the platform . Horace Greeley was in the audience . Again , the performance was purely literary . No formulation of new policies , no appeal for any new departure . It was a masterly restatement of his position ; of the essence of the debates with Douglas . It cleansed the Republican platform of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being scraped of barnacles preparatory to a voyage ; it gave the underlying issues such inflexible definition that they could not be juggled with . Again he showed a power of lucid statement not possessed by any of his rivals . An incident of the speech was his unsparing condemnation of John Brown whose raid and death were on every tongue . " You charge that we stir up insurrections among your slaves , " said he , apostrophizing the slave-holders . " We deny it , and what is your proof ? ' Harper 's Ferry ; John Brown ! ' John Brown was no Republican ; and you have failed to implicate a single Republican in this Harper 's Ferry enterprise . . . " John Brown 's effort was peculiar . It was not a slave insurrection . It was an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves , in which the slaves refused to participate . In fact , it was so absurd that the slaves with all their ignorance saw plainly enough that it could not succeed . That affair in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the assassination of kings and emperors . An enthusiast broods over the oppression of the people until he fancies himself commissioned by heaven to liberate them . He ventures the attempt which ends in little else than his own execution . Orsini 's attempt on Louis Napoleon , and John Brown 's attempt at Harper 's Ferry were , in their philosophy , precisely the same . The eagerness to cast blame on old England in the one case and on New England in the other , does not disprove the sameness of the two things . " The Cooper Union speech received extravagant praise from all the Republican newspapers . Lincoln 's ardent partisans assert that it took New York " by storm . " Rather too violent a way of putting it ! But there can be no doubt that the speech made a deep impression . Thereafter , many of the Eastern managers were willing to consider Lincoln as a candidate , should factional jealousies prove uncompromising . Any port in a storm , you know . Obviously , there could be ports far more dangerous than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventions in the United States have decided upon a compromise candidate , " a dark horse , " through just such reasoning . The most noted instance is the Republican Convention of 1860 . When it assembled at Chicago in June , the most imposing candidate was the brilliant leader of the New York Republicans , Seward . But no man in the country had more bitter enemies . Horace Greeley whose paper The Tribune was by far the most influential Republican organ , went to Chicago obsessed by one purpose : because of irreconcilable personal quarrels he would have revenge upon Seward . Others who did not hate Seward were afraid of what Greeley symbolized . And all of them knew that whatever else happened , the West must be secured . The Lincoln managers played upon the Eastern jealousies and the Eastern fears with great skill . There was little sleep among the delegates the night previous to the balloting . At just the right moment , the Lincoln managers , though their chief had forbidden them to do so , offered promises with regard to Cabinet appointments. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Convention Hall with a perfectly organized claque- " rooters , " the modern American would say . The result on the third ballot was a rush to Lincoln of all the enemies of Seward , and Lincoln 's nomination amid a roaring frenzy of applause . @# @# XI . SECESSION After twenty-three years of successive defeats , Lincoln , almost fortuitously , was at the center of the political maelstrom . The clue to what follows is in the way he had developed during that long discouraging apprenticeship to greatness . Mentally , he had always been in isolation . Socially , he had lived in a near horizon . The real tragedy of his failure at Washington was in the closing against him of the opportunity to know his country as a whole . Had it been Lincoln instead of Douglas to whom destiny had given a residence at Washington during the ' fifties , it is conceivable that things might have been different in the ' sixties . On the other hand , America would have lost its greatest example of the artist in politics . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his party might not have consolidated in 1860 . A very curious party it was . It had sprung to life as a denial , as a device for halting Douglas . Lincoln 's doctrine of the golden mean , became for once a political power . Men of the most diverse views on other issues accepted in their need the axiom : " Stand with anybody so long as he stands right . " And standing right , for that moment in the minds of them all , meant keeping slavery and the money power from devouring the territories . The artist of the movement expressed them all in his declaration that the nation needed the Territories to give home and opportunity to free white people . Even the Abolitionists , who hitherto had refused to make common cause with any other faction , entered the negative coalition of the new party . So did Whigs , and anti-slavery Democrats , as well as other factions then obscure which we should now label Socialists and Labormen . However , this coalition , which in origin was purely negative , revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the man of the near horizon in 1860 neither of these features seemed of first importance . To the man outside that horizon , seeing them in perspective as related to the sum total of American life , they had a significance he did not entirely appreciate . The first of these was the temper of the Abolitionists . Lincoln ignored it . He was content with his ringing assertion of the golden mean . But there spoke the man of letters rather than the statesman . Of temper in politics as an abstract idea , he had been keenly conscious from the first ; but his lack of familiarity with political organizations kept him from assigning full value to the temper of any one factor as affecting the joint temper of the whole group . It was appointed for him to learn this in a supremely hard way and to apply the lesson with wonderful audacity . But in 1860 that stern experience still slept in the future . He had no suspicion as yet that he might find it difficult to carry out his own promise to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to stand against them in enforcing the Fugitive Slave Law . He did not yet see why any one should doubt the validity of this promise ; why any one should be afraid to go along with him , afraid that the temper of one element would infect the whole coalition . But this fear that Lincoln did not allow for , possessed already a great many minds . Thousands of Southerners , of the sort whom Lincoln credited with good intentions about slavery , feared the Abolitionists Not because the Abolitionists wanted to destroy slavery , but because they wanted to do so fiercely , cruelly . Like Lincoln , these Southerners who were liberals in thought and moderates in action , did not know what to do about slavery . Like Lincoln , they had but one fixed idea with regard to it ,  --  slavery must not be terminated violently . Lincoln , despite his near horizon , sensed them correctly as not being at one with the great plutocrats who wished to exploit slavery . But when the Abolitionist poured out the same fury of vituperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul that it should yet have the joy of exulting in the ruin of all such , the moderate Southerners became as flint . When the Abolitionists proclaimed their affiliation with the new party , the first step was taken toward a general Southern coalition to stop the Republican advance . There was another positive element blended into the negative coalition . In 1857 , the Republicans overruling the traditions of those members who had once been Democrats , set their faces toward protection . To most of the Northerners the fatefulness of the step was not obvious . Twenty years had passed since a serious tariff controversy had shaken the North . Financial difficulties in the ' fifties were more prevalent in the North than in the South . Business was in a quandary . Labor was demanding better opportunities . Protection as a solution , or at least as a palliative , seemed to the mass of the Republican coalition , even to the former Democrats for all their free trade traditions , not outrageous . To the Southerners it was an alarm bell . The Southern world was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its market was in England . Ever since 1828 , the Southern mind had been constantly on guard with regard to tariff , unceasingly fearful that protection would be imposed on it by Northern and Western votes . To have to sell its cotton in England at free trade values , but at the same time to have to buy its commodities at protected values fixed by Northern manufacturers  --  what did that mean but the despotism of one section over another ? When the Republicans took up protection as part of their creed , a general Southern coalition was rendered almost inevitable . This , Lincoln Missing text . Again it is to be accounted for in part by his near horizon . Had he lived at Washington , had he met , frequently , Southern men ; had he passed those crucial years of the ' fifties in debates with political leaders rather than in story-telling tournaments on the circuit ; perhaps all this would have been otherwise . But one can not be quite sure . Finance never appealed to him . A wide application may be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . " All the rest of the Republican doctrine finds its best statement in Lincoln . On the one subject of its economic policy he is silent . Apparently it is to be classified with the routine side of the law . To neither was he ever able to give more than a perfunctory attention . As an artist in politics he had the defect of his qualities . What his qualities showed him were two things : the alliance of the plutocratic slave power with the plutocratic money power , and the essential rightness in impulse of the bulk of the Southern people . Hence his conclusion which became his party 's conclusion : that , in the South , a political-financial ring was dominating a leaderless people , This was not the truth . Lincoln 's defects in 1860 limited his vision . Nevertheless , to the solitary distant thinker , shut in by the near horizon of political Springfield , there was every excuse for the error . The palpable evidence all confirmed it . What might have contradicted it was a cloud of witnesses , floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature like Lincoln 's , if only he could have met them , would have perceived and comprehended ; what a nature like Douglas 's , no matter how plainly they were presented to him , could neither perceive nor comprehend . It was the irony of fate that an opportunity to fathom his time was squandered upon the unseeing Douglas , while to the seeing Lincoln it was denied . In a word , the Southern reaction against the Republicans , like the Republican movement itself , had both a positive and a negative side . It was the positive side that could be seen and judged at long range . And this was what Lincoln saw , which appeared to him to have created the dominant issue in 1860 . The negative side of the Southern movement he did not see . He was too far away to make out the details of the picture . Though he may have known from the census of 1850 that only one-third of the Southern whites were members of slave-holding families , he could scarcely have known that only a small minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that those who had fortunes in slaves were a mere handful  --  just as today those who have fortunes in steel or beef are mere handfuls . But still less did he know how entirely this vast majority which had so little , if any , interest in slavery , had grown to fear and distrust the North . They , like him , were suffering from a near horizon . They , too , were applying the principle " Stand with anybody so long as he stands right " But for them , standing right meant preventing a violent revolution in Southern life . Indifferent as they were to slavery , they were willing to go along with the " slave-barons " in the attempt to consolidate the South in a movement of denial  --  a denial of the right of the North , either through Abolitionism or through tariff , to dominate the South . If only Lincoln with his subtle mind could have come into touch with the negative side of the Southern agitation ! It was the other side , the positive side , that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and developed their opportunity . They organized the South . They preached on all occasions , in all connections , the need of all Southerners to stand together , no matter how great their disagreements , in order to prevent the impoverishment of the South by hostile economic legislation . During the late ' fifties their propaganda for an all-Southern policy , made slow but constant headway . But even in 1859 these ideas were still far from controlling the South . And then came John Brown . The dread of slave insurrection was laid deep in Southern recollection . Thirty years before , the Nat Turner Rebellion had filled a portion of Virginia with burned plantation houses amid whose ruins lay the dead bodies of white women . A little earlier , a negro conspiracy at Charleston planned the murder of white men and the parceling out of white women among the conspirators . And John Brown had come into Virginia at the head of a band of strangers calling upon the slaves to rise and arm . Here was a supreme opportunity . The positive Southern force , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South . It was easy enough to enlist the negative force in a shocked and outraged denunciation of everything Northern . And the Northern extremists did all that was in their power to add fuel to the flame . Emerson called Brown " this new saint who had made the gallows glorious as the cross . " The Southerners , hearing that , thought of the conspiracy to parcel out the white women of Charleston . Early in 1860 it seemed as if the whole South had but one idea-to part company with the North . No wonder Lincoln threw all his influence into the scale to discredit the memory of Brown . No wonder the Republicans in their platform carefully repudiated him . They could not undo the impression made on the Southern mind by two facts : the men who lauded Brown as a new saint were voting the Republican ticket ; the Republicans had committed themselves to the anti-Southern policy of protection . And yet , in spite of all the labors of pro-slavery extremists , the movement for a breach with the North lost ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for President revealed a singular and unforeseen situation . Four candidates were in the field . The Democrats , split into two by the issue of slavery expansion , formed two parties . The slave profiteers secured the nomination by one faction of John C. Breckinridge . The moderate Democrats who would neither fight nor favor slavery , nominated Douglas . The most peculiar group was the fourth . They included all those who would not join the Republicans for fear of the temper of the Abolition-members , but who were not promoters of slavery , and who distrusted Douglas . They had no program but to restore the condition of things that existed before the Nebraska Bill . About four million five hundred thousand votes were cast . Lincoln had less than two million , and all but about twenty-four thousand of these were in the Free States . However , the disposition of Lincoln 's vote gave him the electoral college . He was chosen President by the votes of a minority of the nation . But there was another minority vote which as events turned out , proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profiteers , and of all those whom they had persuaded to follow them , had not been able to carry the popular vote of the South . They were definitely in the minority in their own section . The majority of the Southerners had so far reacted from the wild alarms of the beginning of the year that they refused to go along with the candidates of the extremists . They were for giving the Union another trial . The South itself had repudiated the slave profiteers . This was the immensely significant fact of November , 1860 . It made a great impression on the whole country . For the moment it made the fierce talk of the Southern extremists inconsequential . Buoyant Northerners , such as Seward , felt that the crisis was over ; that the South had voted for a reconciliation ; that only tact was needed to make everybody happy . When , a few weeks after the election , Seward said that all would be merry again inside of ninety days , his illusion had for its foundation the Southern rejection of the slave profiteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the thought of the moderate South . He did not understand that while the South had voted to send Breckinridge and his sort about their business , it was still deeply alarmed , deeply fearful that after all it might at any minute be forced to call them back , to make common cause with them against what it regarded as an alien and destructive political power , the Republicans . This was the Southern reservation , the unspoken condition of the vote which Seward  --  and for that matter , Lincoln , also ,  --  failed to comprehend . Because of these cross-purposes , because the Southern alarm was based on another thing than the standing or falling of slavery , the situation called for much more than tact , for profound psychological statesmanship . And now emerges out of the complexities of the Southern situation a powerful personality whose ideas and point of view Lincoln did not understand . Robert Barnwell Rhett had once been a man of might in politics . Twice he had very nearly rent the Union asunder . In 1844 , again in 1851 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Carolina to secede . In each case he sought to organize the general discontent of the South ,  --  its dread of a tariff , and of Northern domination . After his second failure , his haughty nature took offense at fortune . He resigned his seat in the Senate and withdrew to private life . But he was too large and too bold a character to attain obscurity . Nor would his restless genius permit him to rust in ease . During the troubled ' fifties , he watched from a distance , but with ever increasing interest , that negative Southern force which he , in the midst of it , comprehended , while it drifted under the wing of the extremists . As he did so , the old arguments , the old ambitions , the old hopes revived . In 1851 his cry to the South was to assert itself as a Separate nation  --  not for any one reason , but for many reasons  --  and to lead its own life apart from the North . It was an age of brilliant though ill-fated revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at independence had captivated the American imagination . Rhett dreamed of seeing the South do what Hungary had failed to do . He thought of the problem as a medieval knight would have thought , in terms of individual prowess , with the modern factors , economics and all their sort , left on one side . " Smaller nations ( than South Carolina ) , " he said in 1851 , " have striven for freedom against greater odds . " In 1860 he had concluded that his third chance had come . He would try once more to bring about secession . To split the Union , he would play into the hands of the slave-barons . He would aim to combine with their movement the negative Southern movement and use the resulting coalition to crown with success his third attempt . Issuing from his seclusion , he became at once the overshadowing figure in South Carolina . Around him all the elements of revolution crystallized . He was sixty years old ; seasoned and uncompromising in the pursuit of his one ideal , the independence of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1844 , in 1851 : the North would impoverish the South ; it threatens to impose a crushing tribute in the shape of protection ; it seeks to destroy slavery ; it aims to bring about economic collapse ; in the wreck thus produced , everything that is beautiful , charming , distinctive in Southern life will be lost ; let us fight ! With such a leader , the forces of discontent were quickly , effectively , organized . Even before the election of Lincoln , the revolutionary leaders in South Carolina were corresponding with men of like mind in other Southern States , especially Alabama , where was another leader , Yancey , only second in intensity to Rhett . The word from these Alabama revolutionists to South Carolina was to dare all , to risk seceding alone , confident that the other States of the South would follow . Rhett and his new associates took this perilous advice . The election was followed by the call of a convention of delegates of the people of South Carolina . This convention , on the twentieth of December , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other States and proclaimed their own independent . @# @# XII . THE CRISIS Though Seward and other buoyant natures felt that the crisis had passed with the election , less volatile people held the opposite view . Men who had never before taken seriously the Southern threats of disunion had waked suddenly to a terrified consciousness that they were in for it . In their blindness to realities earlier in the year , they were like that brilliant host of camp followers which , as Thackeray puts it , led the army of Wellington dancing and feasting to the very brink of Waterloo . And now the day of reckoning had come . An emotional reaction carried them from one extreme to the other ; from self-sufficient disregard of their adversaries to an almost self-abasing regard . The very type of these people and of their reaction was Horace Greeley . He was destined many times to make plain that he lived mainly in his sensibilities ; that , in his kaleidoscopic vision , the pattern of the world could be red and yellow and green today , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pinnacle of self-complacency into a desolating abyss of panic , was as easy for Greeley as it is  --  in the vulgar but pointed American phrase  --  to roll off a log . A few days after the election , Greeley had rolled off his log . He was wallowing in panic . He began to scream editorially . The Southern extremists were terribly in earnest ; if they wanted to go , go they would , and go they should . But foolish Northerners would be sure to talk war and the retaining of the South in the Union by force : it must not be ; what was the Union compared with bloodshed ? There must be no war  --  no war . Such was Greeley 's terrified  --  appeal to the North . A few weeks after the election he printed his famous editorial denouncing the idea of a Union pinned together by bayonets . He followed up with another startling concession to his fears : the South had as good cause for leaving the Union as the colonies had for leaving the British Empire . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which like many of his ultimates proved to be transitory ,  --  and declared that if any group of Southern States " choose to form an independent nation , they have a clear moral right to do so , " and pledging himself and his followers to do " our best to forward their views . " Greeley wielded through The Tribune more influence , perhaps , than was possessed by any other Republican with the single exception of Lincoln . His newspaper constituency was enormous , and the relation between the leader and the led was unusually close . He was both oracle and barometer . As a symptom of the Republican panic , as a cause increasing that panic , he was of first importance . Meanwhile Congress had met . And at once , the most characteristic peculiarity of the moment was again made emphatic . The popular majorities and the political machines did not coincide . Both in the North and in the South a minority held the situation in the hollow of its hand . The Breckinridge Democrats , despite their repudiation in the presidential vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so well organized , they had scored such a menacing victory with the aid of Rhett in South Carolina , they had played so skilfully on the fears of the South at large , their leaders were such skilled managers , that they were able to continue for the moment the recognized spokesmen of the South at Washington . They lost no time defining their position . If the Union were not to be sundered , the Republicans must pledge themselves to a new and extensive compromise ; it must be far different from those historic compromises that had preceded it . Three features must characterize any new agreement : The South must be dealt with as a unit ; it must be given a " sphere of influence "  --  to use our modern term  --  which would fully satisfy all its impulses of expansion ; and in that sphere , every question of slavery must be left entirely , forever , to local action . In a word , they demanded for the South what today would be described as a " dominion " status . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political machine should formulate its reply to these demands . They gave notice that they would not discuss individual schemes , but only such as the victorious Republicans might officially present . Thus the national crisis became a party crisis . What could the Republicans among themselves agree to propose ? The central figure of the crisis seemed at first to be the brilliant Republican Senator from New York . Seward thought he understood the South , and what was still more important , human nature . Though he echoed Greeley 's cry for peace  --  translating his passionate hysteria into the polished cynicism of a diplomat who had been known to deny that he was ever entirely serious  --  he scoffed at Greeley 's fears . If the South had not voted lack of confidence in the Breckinridge crowd , what had it voted ? If the Breckinridge leaders were n't maneuvering to save their faces , what could they be accused of doing ? If Seward , the Republican man of genius , could n't see through all that , could n't devise a way to help them save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant politician ? Jauntily self-complacent , as confident of himself as if Rome were burning and he the garlanded fiddler , Seward braced himself for the task of recreating the Union . But there was an obstacle in his path . It was Lincoln . Of course , it was folly to propose a scheme which the incoming President would not sustain . Lincoln and Seward must come to an understanding . To bring that about Seward despatched a personal legate to Springfield . Thurlow Weed , editor , man of the world , political wire-puller beyond compare , Seward 's devoted henchman , was the legate . One of the great events of American history was the conversation between Weed and Lincoln in December , 1860 . By a rare propriety of dramatic effect , it occurred probably , on the very day South Carolina brought to an end its campaign of menace and adopted its Ordinance of Secession , December twentieth. ( 1 ) Weed had brought to Springfield a definite proposal . The Crittenden compromise was being hotly discussed in Congress and throughout the country . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was some ground to believe that the Southern machine at Washington would accept it . If Lincoln would agree , Seward would make it the basis of his policy . This Compromise would have restored the old line of the Missouri Compromise and would have placed it under the protection of a constitutional amendment . This , together with a guarantee against congressional interference with slavery in the States where it existed , a guarantee the Republicans had already offered , seemed to Seward , to Weed , to Greeley , to the bulk of the party , a satisfactory means of preserving the Union . What was it but a falling back on the original policy of the party , the undoing of those measures of 1854 which had called the party into being ? Was it conceivable that Lincoln would balk the wishes of the party by obstructing such a natural mode of extrication ? But that was what Lincoln did . His views had advanced since 1854 . Then , he was merely for restoring the old duality of the country , the two " dominions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social order . He had advanced to the belief that this duality could not permanently continue . Just how far Lincoln realized what he was doing in refusing to compromise will never be known . Three months afterward , he took a course which seems to imply that his vision during the interim had expanded , had opened before him a new revelation of the nature of his problem . At the earlier date Lincoln and the Southern people  --  not the Southern machine  --  were looking at the one problem from opposite points of view , and were locating the significance of the problem in different features . To Lincoln , the heart of the matter was slavery . To the Southerners , including the men who had voted lack of confidence in Breckinridge , the heart of the matter was the sphere of influence . What the Southern majority wanted was not the policy of the slave profiteers but a secure future for expansion , a guarantee that Southern life , social , economic , cultural , would not be merged with the life of the opposite section : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Lincoln 's mind , slavery being the main issue , this " dominion " issue was incidental  --  a mere outgrowth of slavery that should begin to pass away with slavery 's restriction . In the Southern mind , a community consciousness , the determination to be a people by themselves , nation within the nation , was the issue , and slavery was the incident . To repeat , it is impossible to say what Lincoln would have done had he comprehended the Southern attitude . His near horizon which had kept him all along from grasping the negative side of the Southern movement prevented his perception of this tragic instance of cross-purposes . Lacking this perception , his thoughts had centered themselves on a recent activity of the slave profiteers . They had clamored for the annexation of new territory to the south of us . Various attempts had been made to create an international crisis looking toward the seizure of Cuba . Then , too , bold adventurers had staked their heads , seeking to found slave-holding communities in Central America . Why might not such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created outside the Union , eventually to be drawn in ? Why not ? said the slave profiteer , and gave money and assistance to the filibusters in Nicaragua . Why not ? said Lincoln , also . What protection against such an extension of boundaries ? Was the limitation of slave area to be on one side only , the Northern side ? And here at last , for Lincoln , was what appeared to be the true issue of the moment . To dualize the Union , assuming its boundaries to be fixed , was one thing . To dualize the Union in the face of a movement for extension of boundaries was another . Hence it was now vital , as Lincoln reasoned , to give slavery a fixed boundary on all sides . Silently , while others fulminated , or rhapsodized , or wailed , he had moved inexorably to a new position which was nothing but a logical development of the old . The old position was  --  no extension of slave territory ; the new position was  --  no more Slave States. ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Slave State in Cuba , a new Slave State in Nicaragua , perhaps a dozen such new States , Lincoln refused to compromise. ( 3 ) It was a terrible decision , carrying within it the possibility of civil war . But Lincoln could not be moved . This was the first acquaintance of the established political leaders with his inflexible side . In the recesses of his own thoughts the decision had been reached . It was useless to argue with him . Weed carried back his ultimatum . Seward abandoned Crittenden 's scheme . The only chance for compromise passed away . The Southern leaders set about their plans for organizing a Southern Confederacy. @# @# XIII . ECLIPSE Lincoln 's ultimatum of December twentieth contained three proposals that might be made to the Southern leaders : That the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law which hitherto had been left to State authorities should be taken over by Congress and supported by the Republicans . That the Republicans to the extent of their power should work for the repeal of all those " Personal Liberty Laws " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation of the Fugitive Slave Law . That the Federal Union must be preserved. ( 1 ) In presenting these proposals along with a refusal to consider the Crittenden Compromise , Seward tampered with their clear-cut form . Fearful of the effect on the extremists of the Republican group , he withheld Lincoln 's unconditional promise to maintain the Fugitive Slave Law and instead of pledging his party to the repeal of Personal Liberty Laws he promised only to have Congress request the States to repeal them . He suppressed altogether the assertion that the Union must be preserved. ( 2 ) About the same time , in a public speech , he said he was not going to be " humbugged " by the bogy of secession , and gave his fatuous promise that all the trouble would be ended inside ninety days . For all his brilliancy of a sort , he was spiritually obtuse . On him , as on Douglas , Fate had lavished opportunities to see life as it is , to understand the motives of men ; but it could not make him use them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself of the idea that all this confusion was hubbub , was but an ordinary political game , that his only cue was to assist his adversaries in saving their faces . In spite of his rich experience ,  --  in spite of being an accomplished man of the world ,  --  at least in his own estimation  --  he was as blind to the real motives of that Southern majority which had rejected Breckinridge as was the inexperienced Lincoln . The coolness with which he modified Lincoln 's proposals was evidence that he considered himself the great Republican and Lincoln an accident . He was to do the same again  --  to his own regret . When Lincoln issued his ultimatum , he was approaching the summit , if not at the very summit , of another of his successive waves of vitality , of self-confidence . That depression which came upon him about the end of 1858 , which kept him undecided , in a mood of excessive caution during most of 1859 , had passed away . The presidential campaign with its thrilling tension , its excitement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eclipse was in store for him  --  the darkest eclipse of all  --  he was very nearly the definitive Lincoln of history . At least , he had the courage which that Lincoln was to show . He was now the target for a besieging army of politicians clamoring for " spoils " in the shape of promises of preferment . It was a miserable and disgraceful assault which profoundly offended him. ( 3 ) To his mind this was not the same thing as the simple-hearted personal politics of his younger days  --  friends standing together and helping one another along  --  but a gross and monstrous rapacity . It was the first chill shadow that followed the election day . There were difficult intrigues over the Cabinet . Promises made by his managers at Chicago were presented for redemption . Rival candidates bidding for his favor , tried to cut each other 's throats . For example , there was the intrigue of the War Department . The Lincoln managers had promised a Cabinet appointment to Pennsylvania ; the followers of Simon Cameron were a power ; it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln ; they insisted that their leader was now entitled to the Pennsylvania seat in the Cabinet ; but there was an anti-Cameron faction almost as potent in Pennsylvania as the Cameron faction . Both sent their agents to Springfield to lay siege to Lincoln . In this duel , the Cameron forces won the first round . Lincoln offered him the Secretaryship . Subsequently , his enemies made so good a case that Lincoln was convinced of the unwisdom of his decision and withdrew the offer . But Cameron had not kept the offer confidential . The withdrawal would discredit him politically and put a trump card into the hands of his enemies . A long dispute followed . Not until Lincoln had reached Washington , immediately before the inauguration , was the dispute ended , the withdrawal withdrawn , and Cameron appointed. ( 4 ) It was a dreary winter for the President-elect . It was also a brand-new experience . For the first time he was a dispenser of favor on a grand scale . Innumerable men showed their meanest side , either to advance themselves or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew in shamelessness , his friends became more and more conscious of his peculiar melancholy . The elation of the campaign subsided into a deep unhappiness over the vanity of this world . Other phases of the shadowy side of his character also asserted themselves . Conspicuous was a certain trend in his thinking that was part of Herndon 's warrant for calling him a fatalist . Lincoln 's mysticism very early had taken a turn toward predestination , coupled with a belief in dreams. ( 5 ) He did not in any way believe in magic ; he never had any faith in divinations , in the occult , in any secret mode of alluring the unseen powers to take one 's side . Nevertheless , he made no bones about being superstitious . And he thought that coming events cast their shadows before , that something , at least , of the future was sometimes revealed through dreams . " Nature , " he would say , " is the workshop of the Almighty , and we form but links in the chain of intellectual and material life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his favorite poems . He pondered those ancient , historical tales which make free use of portents . There was a fascination for him in the story of Caracalla  --  how his murder of Geta was foretold , how he was upbraided by the ghosts of his father and brother . This dream-faith of his was as real as was a similar faith held by the authors of the Old Testament . He had his theory of the interpretation of dreams . Because they were a universal experience  --  as he believed , the universal mode of communication between the unseen and the seen  --  his beloved " plain people , " the " children of Nature , " the most universal types of humanity , were their best interpreters . He also believed in presentiment . As faithfully as the simplest of the brood of the forest  --  those recreated primitives who regulated their farming by the brightness or the darkness of the moon , who planted corn or slaughtered hogs as Artemis directed  --  he trusted a presentiment if once it really took possession of him . A presentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not when , was clothed with authority by a dream , or rather a vision , that came to him in the days of melancholy disillusion during the last winter at Springfield . Looking into a mirror , he saw two Lincolns ,  --  one alive , the other dead . It was this vision which clenched his pre-sentiment that he was born to a great career and to a tragic end . He interpreted the vision that his administration would be successful , but that it would close with his death. ( 7 ) The record of his inner life during the last winter at Springfield is very dim . But there can be no doubt that a desolating change attacked his spirit . As late as the day of his ultimatum he was still in comparative sunshine , or , at least his clouds were not close about him . His will was steel , that day . Nevertheless , a friend who visited him in January , to talk over their days together , found not only that " the old-time zest " was lacking , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 8 ) The ghosts that hovered so frequently at the back of his mind , the brooding tendencies which fed upon his melancholy and made him at times irresolute , were issuing from the shadows , trooping forward , to encompass him roundabout . In the midst of this spiritual reaction , he was further depressed by the stern news from the South and from Washington . His refusal to compromise was beginning to bear fruit . The Gulf States seceded . A Southern Confederacy was formed . There is no evidence that he lost faith in his course , but abundant evidence that he was terribly unhappy . He was preyed upon by his sense of helplessness , while Buchanan through his weakness and vacillation was " giving away the case . " " Secession is being fostered , " said he , " rather than repressed , and if the doctrine meets with general acceptance in the Border States , it will be a great blow to the government . " ( 9 ) He did not deceive himself upon the possible effect of his ultimatum , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to " retake " the forts garrisoned by Federal troops in the Southern States. ( 10 ) All the while his premonition of the approach of doom grew more darkly oppressive . The trail of the artist is discernible across his thoughts . In his troubled imagination he identified his own situation with that of the protagonist in tragedies on the theme of fate . He did not withhold his thoughts from the supreme instance . That same friend who found him possessed of gloom preserved these words of his : " I have read on my knees the story of Gethsemane , when the Son of God prayed in vain that the cup of bitterness might pass from him . I am in the Garden of Gethsemane now and my cup of bitterness is full and overflowing now . " ( 11 ) " Like some strong seer in a trance , Seeing all his own mischance , With a glassy countenance , " he faced toward Washington , toward the glorious terror promised him by his superstitions . The last days before the departure were days of mingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He visited his old stepmother and made a pilgrimage to his father 's grave . His thoughts fondly renewed the details of his past life , lingered upon this and that , as if fearful that it was all slipping away from him forever . And then he roused himself as if in sudden revolt against the Fates . The day before he left Springfield forever Lincoln met his partner for the last time at their law office to wind up the last of their unsettled business . " After those things were all disposed of , " says Herndon , " he crossed to the opposite side of the room and threw himself down on the old office sofa . . . . He lay there for some moments his face to the ceiling without either of us speaking . Presently , he inquired : ' Billy '  --  he always called me by that name  --  ' how long have we been together ? ' ' Over sixteen years , ' I answered . ' We 've never had a cross word during all that time , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of papers and books he wished to take with him and started to go , but before leaving , he made the strange request that the sign board which swung on its rusty hinges at the foot of the stairway would remain . ' Let it hang there undisturbed , ' he said , with a significant lowering of the voice . ' Give our clients to understand that the election of a President makes no change in the firm of Lincoln &; Herndon . If I live , I am coming back some time , and then we 'll go right on practising law as if nothing had happened . ' He lingered for a moment as if to take a last look at the old quarters , and then passed through the door into the narrow hallway . " ( 12 ) On a dreary day with a cold rain falling , he set forth . The railway station was packed with friends . He made his way through the crowd slowly , shaking hands . " Having finally reached the train , he ascended the rear platform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him , drew himself up to his full height , removed his hat and stood for several seconds in profound silence . His eyes roved sadly over that sea of upturned faces . . . There was an unusual quiver on his lips and a still more unusual tear on his shriveled cheek . His solemn manner , his long silence , were as full of melancholy eloquence as any words he could have uttered . " ( 13 ) At length , he spoke : " My friends , no one not in my situation can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting . To this place and the kindness of these people , I owe everything . Here I have lived a quarter of a century , and have passed from a young to an old man . Here my children have been born and one is buried . I now leave , not knowing when or whether ever , I may return , with a task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington . Without the assistance of that Divine Being who ever attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can not fail . Trusting in Him who can go with me and remain with you , and be everywhere for good , let us confidently hope that all will yet be well . To His care commending you , as I hope in your prayers you will commend me , I bid you an affectionate farewell . " ( 14 ) @# @# XIV . THE STRANGE NEW MAN There is a period of sixteen months  --  from February , 1861 , to a day in June , 1862 ,  --  when Lincoln is the most singular , the most problematic of statesmen . Out of this period he issues with apparent abruptness , the final Lincoln , with a place among the few consummate masters of state-craft . During the sixteen months , his genius comes and goes . His confidence , whether in himself or in others , is an uncertain quantity . At times he is bold , even rash ; at others , irresolute . The constant factor in his mood all this while is his amazing humility . He seems to have forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislikes , with personal hopes and fears , he has vanished . He is but an afflicted and perplexed mind , struggling desperately to save his country . A selfless man , he may be truly called through months of torment which made him over from a theoretical to a practical statesman . He entered this period a literary man who had been elevated almost by accident to the position of a leader in politics . After many blunders , after doubt , hesitation and pain , he came forth from this stern ordeal a powerful man of action . The impression which he made on the country at the opening of this period was unfortunate . The very power that had hitherto been the making of him  --  the literary power , revealing to men in wonderfully convincing form the ideas which they felt within them but could not utter  --  this had deserted him . Explain the psychology of it any way you will , there is the fact ! The speeches Lincoln made on the way to Washington during the latter part of February were appallingly unlike himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to say . The gloom , the desolation that had penetrated his soul , somehow , for the moment , made him commonplace . When he talked  --  as convention required him to do at all his stopping places  --  his words were but faint echoes of the great political exponent he once had been . His utterances were fatuous ; mere exhortations to the country not to worry . " There is no crisis but an artificial one , " he said. ( 1 ) And the country stood aghast ! Amazement , bewilderment , indignation , was the course of the reaction in many minds of his own party . Their verdict was expressed in the angry language of Samuel Bowles , " Lincoln is a Simple Susan . " ( 2 ) In private talk , Lincoln admitted that he was " more troubled about the outlook than he thought it discreet to show . " This remark was made to a " Public Man , " whose diary has been published but whose identity is still secret . Though keenly alert for any touch of weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most ill-favored son of Adam I ever saw , " the Public Man found him " crafty and sensible . " In conversation , the old Lincoln , the matchless phrase-maker , could still express himself . At New York he was told of a wild scheme that was on foot to separate the city from the North , form a city state such as Hamburg then was , and set up a commercial alliance with the Confederacy . " As to the free city business , " said Lincoln , " well , I reckon it will be some time before the front door sets up bookkeeping on its own account . " ( 3 ) The formal round of entertainment on his way to Washington wearied Lincoln intensely . Harassed and preoccupied , he was generally ill at ease . And he was totally unused to sumptuous living . Failures in social usage were inevitable . New York was convulsed with amusement because at the opera he wore a pair of huge black kid gloves which attracted the attention of the whole house , " hanging as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an informal reception , between acts in the director 's room , he looked terribly bored and sat on the sofa at the end of the room with his hat pushed back on his head . Caricatures filled the opposition papers . He was spoken of as the " Illinois ape " and the " gorilla . " Every rash remark , every " break " in social form , every gaucherie was seized upon and ridiculed with-out mercy . There is no denying that the oddities of Lincoln 's manner though quickly dismissed from thought by men of genius , seriously troubled even generous men who lacked the intuitions of genius . And he never overcame these oddities . During the period of his novitiate as a ruler , the critical sixteen months , they were carried awkwardly , with embarrassment . Later when he had found himself as a ruler , when his self-confidence had reached its ultimate form and he knew what he really was , he forgot their existence . None the less , they were always a part of him , his indelible envelope . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet in leather slippers. ( 4 ) He discussed great affairs of state with one of those slippered feet flung up on to a corner of his desk . A favorite attitude , even when debating vital matters with the great ones of the nation , is described by his secretaries as " sitting on his shoulders "  --  he would slide far down into his chair and stick up both slippers so high above his head that they could rest with ease upon his mantelpiece. ( 5 ) No wonder that his enemies made unlimited fun . And they professed to believe that there was an issue here . When the elegant McClellan was moving heaven and earth , as he fancied , to get the army out of its shirt-sleeves , the President 's manner was a cause of endless irritation . Still more serious was the effect of his manner on many men who agreed with him otherwise . Such a high-minded leader as Governor Andrew of Massachusetts never got over the feeling that Lincoln was a rowdy . How could a rowdy be the salvation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a rebellion against his leadership was attempted , this merely accidental side of him was an element of danger . The barrier it had created between himself and the more formal types , made it hard for the men who finally saved him to overcome their prejudice and nail his colors to the mast . Andrew 's biographer shows himself a shrewd observer when he insists on the unexpressed but inexorable scale by which Andrew and his following measured Lincoln . They had grown up in the faith that you could tell a statesman by certain external signs , chiefly by a grandiose and commanding aspect such as made overpowering the presence of Webster . And this idea was not confined to any one locality . Everywhere , more or less , the conservative portion in every party held this view . It was the view of Washington in 1848 when Washington had failed to see the real Lincoln through his surface peculiarities . It was again the view of Washington when Lincoln returned to it . Furthermore , his free way of talking , the broad stories he continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the bequests of Puritanism in America is the ideal , at least , of extreme scrupulousness in talk . To many sincere men Lincoln 's choice of fables was often a deadly offense . Charles Francis Adams never got over the shock of their first interview . Lincoln clenched a point with a broad story . Many professional politicians who had no objection to such talk in itself , glared and sneered when the President used it  --  because forsooth , it might estrange a vote . Then , too , Lincoln had none of the social finesse that might have adapted his manner to various classes . He was always incorrigibly the democrat pure and simple . He would have laughed uproariously over that undergraduate humor , the joy of a famous American University , supposedly strong on Democracy : " Where God speaks to Jones , in the very same tones , That he uses to Hadley and Dwight . " Though Lincoln 's queer aplomb , his good-humored familiarity on first acquaintance , delighted most of his visitors , it offended many . It was lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be jovial too soon , as when he addressed Greeley by the name of " Horace " almost on first sight . His devices for putting men on the familiar footing lacked originality . The frequency with which he called upon a tall visitor to measure up against him reveals the poverty of his social invention . He applied this device with equal thoughtlessness to the stately Sumner , who protested , and to a nobody who grinned and was delighted . It was this mere envelope of the genius that was deplorably evident on the journey from Springfield to Washington . There was one detail of the journey that gave his enemies a more definite ground for sneering . By the irony of fate , the first clear instance of Lincoln 's humility , his reluctance to set up his own judgment against his advisers , was also his first serious mistake . There is a distinction here that is vital . Lincoln was entering on a new role , the role of the man of action . Hitherto all the great decisions of his life had been speculative ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The inflexible side of him was intellectual . Now , without any adequate apprenticeship , he was called upon to make practical decisions , to decide on courses of action , at one step to pass from the dream of statecraft to its application . Inevitably , for a considerable time , he was two people ; he passed back and forth from one to the other ; only by degrees did he bring the two together . Meanwhile , he appeared contradictory . Inwardly , as a thinker , his development was unbroken ; he was still cool , inflexible , drawing all his conclusions out of the depths of himself . Outwardly , in action , he was learning the new task , hesitatingly , with vacillation , with excessive regard to the advisers whom he treated as experts in action . It was no slight matter for an extraordinarily sensitive man to take up a new role at fifty-two . This first official mistake of Lincoln 's was in giving way to the fears of his retinue for his safety . The time had become hysterical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he left Springfield there were rumors of plots to assassinate him. ( 6 ) On his arrival at Philadelphia information was submitted to his companions which convinced them that his life was in danger  --  an attempt would be made to kill him as he passed through Baltimore . Seward at Washington had heard the same story and had sent his son to Philadelphia to advise caution . Lincoln 's friends insisted that he leave his special train and proceed to Washington with only one companion , on an ordinary night train . Railway officials were called in . Elaborate precautions were arranged . The telegraph lines were all to be disconnected for a number of hours so that even if the conspirators  --  assuming there were any  --  should discover his change of plan , they would be unable to communicate with Baltimore . The one soldier in the party , Colonel Sumner , vehemently protested that these changes were all " a damned piece of cowardice . " But Lincoln acquiesced in the views of the majority of his advisers . He passed through Baltimore virtually in disguise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was discovered . And all his enemies took up the cry of cowardice and rang the changes upon it. ( 7 ) Meanwhile , despite all this semblance of indecision , of feebleness , there were signs that the real inner Lincoln , however clouded , was still alive . By way of offset to his fatuous utterances , there might have been set , had the Country been in a mood to weigh with care , several strong and clear pronouncements . And these were not merely telling phrases like that characteristic one about the bookkeeping of the front door . His mind was struggling out of its shadow . And the mode of its reappearance was significant . His reasoning upon the true meaning of the struggle he was about to enter , reached a significant stage in the speech he made at Harrisburg. ( 8 ) " I have often inquired of myself , " he said , " what great principle or idea it was that kept this Confederacy ( the United States ) so long together . It was not the mere matter of the separation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Declaration of Independence which gave liberty not alone to the people of the country but hope to all the world for all future time . It was that which gave promise that in due time the weights would be lifted from the shoulders of all men and that all should have an equal chance . This is the sentiment embodied in the Declaration of Independence . Now , my friends , can this country be saved on that basis ? If it can , I will consider myself one of the happiest men in the world , if I can help to save it . If it can not be saved upon that principle , it will be truly awful . But if this country can not be saved without giving up that principle , I was about to say I would rather be assassinated on this spot than surrender it . Now , in my view of the present aspect of affairs , there is no need of bloodshed and war . There is no necessity for it I am not in favor of such a course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no bloodshed unless it is forced upon the government . The government will not use force unless force is used against it . " The two ideas underlying this utterance had grown in his thought steadily , consistently , ever since their first appearance in the Protest twenty-four years previous . The great issue to which all else  --  slavery , " dominion status , " everything  --  was subservient , was the preservation of democratic institutions ; the means to that end was the preservation of the Federal government . Now , as in 1852 , his paramount object was not to " disappoint the Liberal party throughout the world , " to prove that Democracy , when applied on a great scale , had yet sufficient coherence to remain intact , no matter how powerful , nor how plausible , were the forces of disintegration . Dominated by this purpose he came to Washington . There he met Seward . It was the stroke of fate for both men . Seward , indeed , did not know that it was . He was still firmly based in the delusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour . And he had this excuse , that it was also the country 's delusion . There was pretty general belief both among friends and foes that Lincoln would be ruled by his Cabinet . In a council that was certain to include leaders of accepted influence  --  Seward , Chase , Cameron  --  what chance for this untried newcomer , whose prestige had been reared not on managing men , but on uttering words ? In Seward 's thoughts the answer was as inevitable as the table of addition . Equally mathematical was the conclusion that only one unit gave value to the combination . And , of course , the leader of the Republicans in the Senate was the unit . A severe experience had to be lived through before Seward made his peace with destiny . Lincoln was the quicker to perceive when they came together that something had happened . Almost from the minute of their meeting , he began to lean upon Seward ; but only in a certain way . This was not the same thing as that yielding to the practical advisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of so much confusion . His response to Seward was intellectual . It was of the inner man and revealed itself in his style of writing . Hitherto , Lincoln 's progress in literature had been marked by the development of two characteristics and by the lack of a third . The two that he possessed were taste and rhythm . At the start he was free from the prevalent vice of his time , rhetoricality . His " Address to the Voters of Sangamon County " which was his first state paper , was as direct , as free from bombast , as the greatest of his later achievements . Almost any other youth who had as much of the sense of language as was there exhibited , would have been led astray by the standards of the hour , would have mounted the spread-eagle and flapped its wings in rhetorical clamor . But Lincoln was not precocious . In art , as in everything else , he progressed slowly ; the literary part of him worked its way into the matter-of-fact part of him with the gradualness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not constant in its development . For many years it was little more than an irregular deepening of his two original characteristics , taste and rhythm . His taste , fed on Blackstone , Shakespeare , and the Bible , led him more and more exactingly to say just what he meant , to eschew the wiles of decoration , to be utterly non-rhetorical . His sense of rhythm , beginning simply , no more at first than a good ear for the sound of words , deepened into keen perception of the character of the word-march , of that extra significance which is added to an idea by the way it conducts itself , moving grandly or feebly as the case may be , from the unknown into the known , and thence across a perilous horizon , into memory . On the basis of these two characteristics he had acquired a style that was a rich blend of simplicity , directness , candor , joined with a clearness beyond praise , with a delightful cadence , having always a splendidly ordered march of ideas . But there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wanting . Marvelously apt for the purpose of the moment , his writings previous to 1861 are vanishing from the world 's memory . The more notable writings of his later years have become classics . And the difference does not turn on subject-matter . All the ideas of his late writings had been formulated in the earlier . The difference is purely literary . The earlier writings were keen , powerful , full of character , melodious , impressive . The later writings have all these qualities , and in addition , that constant power to awaken the imagination , to carry an idea beyond its own horizon into a boundless world of imperishable literary significance , which power in argumentative prose is beauty . And how did Lincoln attain this ? That he had been maturing from within the power to do this , one is compelled by the analogy of his other mental experiences to believe . At the same time , there can be no doubt who taught him the trick , who touched the secret spring and opened the new door to his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them that Seward was to be Secretary of State. ( 9 ) Lincoln asked him to criticize his inaugural . Seward did so , and Lincoln , in the main , accepted his criticism . But Seward went further . He proposed a new paragraph . He was not a great writer and yet he had something of that third thing which Lincoln hitherto had not exhibited . However , in pursuing beauty of statement , he often came dangerously near to mere rhetoric ; his taste was never sure ; his sense of rhythm was inferior ; the defects of his qualities were evident . None the less , Lincoln saw at a glance that if he could infuse into Seward 's words his own more robust qualities , the result  --  ' would be a richer product than had ever issued from his own qualities as hitherto he had known them . He effected this transmutation and in doing so raised his style to a new range of effectiveness . The great Lincoln of literature appeared in the first inaugural and particularly in that noble passage which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it said only what Lincoln had already said  --  especially in the speech at Harrisburg  --  but with what a difference ! " In your hands , my dissatisfied fellow countrymen , and not in mine , is the momentous issue of civil war . The government will not assail you . You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors . You have no oath registered in Heaven to destroy the government , while I shall have the most solemn one to preserve , protect and defend it . " I am loath to close . We are not enemies but friends . Though passion may have strained , it must not break our bonds of affection . The mystic chords of memory stretching from every battle-field and patriot grave , to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land , will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched as surely they will be , by the better angels of our nature . " * *Lincoln VI , 184 ; N. &; H. , III , 343 . Seward advised the omission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two paragraphs . After " defend it , " Lincoln had written , " You can forbear the assault upon it . I can not shrink from the defense of it . With you and not with me is the solemn question ' Shall it be peace or a sword ? ' " Having struck this out , he accepted Seward 's advice to add " some words of affection  --  some of calm and cheerful confidence . " The original version of the concluding paragraph was prepared by Seward and read as follows : " I close . We are not , we must not he aliens or enemies , but fellow-countrymen and brethren . Although passion has strained our bonds of affection too hardly , they must not , I am sure , they will not , be broken . The mystic chords which , proceeding from so many battlefields and so many patriot graves , pass through all the hearts and all hearths in this broad continent of ours , will yet again harmonize in their ancient music when breathed upon by the guardian angel of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken in the east portico of the Capitol on " one of our disagreeable , clear , windy , Washington spring days . " ( 10 ) Most of the participants were agitated ; many were alarmed . Chief Justice Taney who administered the oath could hardly speak , so near to uncontrollable was his emotion . General Scott anxiously kept his eye upon the crowd which was commanded by cannon . Cavalry were in readiness to clear the streets in case of riot . Lincoln 's carriage on the way to the Capitol had been closely guarded . He made his way to the portico between files of soldiers . So intent  --  overintent  --  were his guardians upon his safety that they had been careless of the smaller matter of his comfort . There was insufficient room for the large company that had been invited to attend . The new President stood beside a rickety little table and saw no place on which to put his hat . Senator Douglas stepped forward and relieved him of the burden . Lincoln was " pale and very nervous , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Observers differ point-blank as to the way the inaugural was received . The " Public Man " says that there was little enthusiasm . The opposite version makes the event an oratorical triumph , with the crowd , at the close , completely under his spell. ( 11 ) On the whole , the inauguration and the festivities that followed appear to have formed a dismal event . While Lincoln spoke , the topmost peak of the Capitol , far above his head , was an idle derrick ; the present dome was in process of construction ; work on it had been arrested , and who could say when , if ever , the work would be resumed ? The day closed with an inaugural ball that was anything but brilliant . " The great tawdry ballroom . . . not half full  --  and such an assemblage of strange costumes , male and female . Very few people of any consideration were there . The President looked exhausted and uncomfortable , and most ungainly in his dress ; and Mrs. Lincoln all in blue , with a feather in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 ) @# @# XV . PRESIDENT AND PREMIER The brilliant Secretary , who so promptly began to influence the President had very sure foundations for that influence . He was inured to the role of great man ; he had a rich experience of public life ; while Lincoln , painfully conscious of his inexperience , was perhaps the humblest-minded ruler that ever took the helm of a ship of state in perilous times . Furthermore , Seward had some priceless qualities which , for Lincoln , were still to seek . First of all , he had audacity  --  personally , artistically , politically . Seward 's instantaneous gift to Lincoln was by way of throwing wide the door of his gathering literary audacity . There is every reason to think that Seward 's personal audacity went to Lincoln 's heart at once . To be sure , he was not yet capable of going along with it . The basal contrast of the first month of his administration lies between the President 's caution and the boldness of the Secretary . Nevertheless , to a sensitive mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the splendid fearlessness of Seward , whether wise or foolish , must have rung like a trumpet peal soaring over the heads of a crowd whose teeth were chattering . While the rest of the Cabinet pressed their ears to the ground , Seward thought out a policy , made a forecast of the future , and offered to stake his head on the correctness of his reasoning . This may have been rashness ; it may have been folly ; but , intellectually at least , it was valor . Among Lincoln 's other advisers , valor at that moment was lacking . Contrast , however , was not the sole , nor the surest basis of Seward 's appeal to Lincoln . Their characters had a common factor . For all their immeasurable difference in externals , both at bottom were void of malice . It was this characteristic above all others that gave them spiritually common ground . In Seward , this quality had been under fire for a long while . The political furies of " that iron time " had failed to rouse echoes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who accepted him as leader because , indeed , they could not do without him  --  because none other in their camp had his genius for management , for the glorification of political intrigue  --  these same men followed him doubtfully , with bad grace , willing to shift to some other leader whenever he might arise . The clue to their distrust was Seward 's amusement at the furious . Could a man who laughed when you preached on the beauty of the hewing of Agag , could such a man be sincere ? And that Seward in some respects was not sincere , history generally admits . He loved to poke fun at his opponents by appearing to sneer at himself , by ridiculing the idea that he was ever serious . His scale of political values was different from that of most of his followers . Nineteen times out of twenty , he would treat what they termed " principles " as mere political counters , as legitimate subjects of bargain . If by any deal he could trade off any or all of these nineteen in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only vital one , he never scrupled to do so . Against a lurid background of political ferocity , this amused , ironic figure came to be rated by the extremists , both in his own and in the enemy camp as Mephistopheles . No quality could have endeared him more certainly to Lincoln than the very one which the bigots misunderstood . From his earliest youth Lincoln had been governed by this same quality . With his non-censorious mind , which accepted so much of life as he found it , which was forever stripping principles of their accretions , what could be more inevitable than his warming to the one great man at Washington who like him held that such a point of view was the only rational one . Seward 's ironic peacefulness in the midst of the storm gained in luster because all about him raged a tempest of ferocity , mitigated , at least so far as the distracted President could see , only by self-interest or pacifism . As Lincoln came into office , he could see and hear many signs of a rising fierceness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal to conquer the Gulf States , expel their white population , and reduce the region to a gigantic state preserve , where negroes should grow cotton under national supervision. ( 1 ) " We of the North , " said Senator Baker of Oregon , " are a majority of the Union , and we will govern our Union in our own way . " ( 2 ) At the other extreme was the hysterical pacifism of the Abolitionists . Part of Lincoln 's abiding quarrel with the Abolitionists was their lack of national feeling . Their peculiar form of introspection had injected into politics the idea of personal sin . Their personal responsibility for slavery  --  they being part of a country that tolerated it  --  was their basal inspiration . Consequently , the most distinctive Abolitionists welcomed this opportunity to cast off their responsibility . If war had been proposed as a crusade to abolish slavery , their attitude might have been different But in March , 1860 , no one but the few ultra-extremists , whom scarcely anybody heeded , dreamed of such a war . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was considered seriously . Such a war , the Abolitionists bitterly condemned . They seized upon pacifism as their defense . Said Whittier of the Seceding States : They break the links of Union : shall we light The fires of hell to weld anew the chain , On that red anvil where each blow is pain ? The fury and the fear offended Lincoln in equal measure . After long years opposing the political temper of the extremists , he was not the man now to change front . To one who believed himself marked out for a tragic end , the cowardice at the heart of the pacifism of his time was revolting . It was fortunate for his own peace of mind that he could here count on the Secretary of State . No argument based on fear of pain would meet in Seward with anything but derision . " They tell us , " he had once said , and the words expressed his constant attitude , " that we are to encounter opposition . Why , bless my soul , did anybody ever expect to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a crown in heaven , without encountering resistance and opposition ? What are we made men for but to encounter and overcome opposition arrayed against us in the line of our duty ? " ( 3 ) But if the ferocity and the cowardice were offensive and disheartening , there was something else that was beneath contempt . Never was self-interest more shockingly displayed . It was revealed in many ways , but impinged upon the new President in only one . A horde of office-seekers besieged him in the White House . The parallel to this amazing picture can hardly be found in history . It was taken for granted that the new party would make a clean sweep of the whole civil list , that every government employee down to the humblest messenger boy too young to have political ideas was to bear the label of the victorious party . Every Congressman who had made promises to his constituents , every politician of every grade who thought he had the party in his debt , every adventurer who on any pretext could make a showing of party service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horde . " Hark , hark , the dogs do bark , The beggars are coming to town . " They converted the White House into a leaguer . They swarmed into the corridors and even the private passages . So dense was the swarm that it was difficult to make one 's way either in or out . Lincoln described himself by the image of a man renting rooms at one end of his house while the other end was on fire. ( 4 ) And all this while the existence of the Republic was at stake ! It did not occur to him that it was safe to defy the horde , to send it about its business . Here again , the figure of Seward stood out in brilliant light against the somber background . One of Seward 's faculties was his power to form devoted lieutenants . He had that sure and nimble judgment which enables some men to inspire their lieutenants rather than categorically to instruct them . All the sordid side of his political games he managed in this way . He did not appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the politicians to find offices for their retainers , Seward was conspicuous by contrast . Even the Cabinet was not free from this vice of catering to the thirsty horde. ( 5 ) Alone , at this juncture , Seward detached himself from the petty affairs of the hour and gave his whole attention to statecraft . He had a definite policy . Another point of contact with Lincoln was the attitude of both toward the Union , supplemented as it was by their views of the place of slavery in the problem they confronted . Both were nationalists ready to make any sacrifices for the national idea . Both regarded slavery as an issue of second importance . Both were prepared for great concessions if convinced that , ultimately , their concessions would strengthen the trend of American life toward a general exaltation of nationality . On the other hand , their differences  --  Seward approached the problem in the same temper , with the same assumptions , that were his in the previous December . He still believed that his main purpose was to enable a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat . Imputing to the Southern leaders an attitude of pure self-interest , he believed that if allowed to play the game as they desired , they would mark time until circumstances revealed to them whether there was more profit for them in the Union or out ; he also believed that if sufficient time could be given , and if no armed clash took place , it would be demonstrated first , that they did not have so strong a hold on the South as they had thought they had ; and second , that on the whole , it was to their interests to patch up the quarrel and come back into the Union . But he also saw that they had a serious problem of leadership , which , if rudely handled , might make it impossible for them to stand still . They had inflamed the sentiment of state-patriotism . In South Carolina , particularly , the popular demand was for independence . With this went the demand that Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor , garrisoned by Federal troops , should be surrendered , or if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few cannon shots at Sumter would mean war . An article in Seward 's creed of statecraft asserted that the populace will always go wild over a war . To prevent a war fever in the North was the first condition of his policy at home . Therefore , in order to prevent it , the first step in saving his enemies ' faces was to safeguard them against the same danger in their own calm . He must help them to prevent a war fever in the South . He saw but one way to do this . The conclusion which became the bed rock of his policy was inevitable . Sumter must be evacuated . Even before the inauguration , he had broached this idea to Lincoln . He had tried to keep Lincoln from inserting in the inaugural the words , " The power confided to me will be used to hold , occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government . " He had proposed instead , " The power confided in me shall be used indeed with efficacy , but also with discretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances actually existing , and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles , and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections . " ( 6 ) With the rejection of Seward 's proffered revision , a difference between them in policy began to develop . Lincoln , says one of his secretaries , accepted Seward 's main purpose but did not share his " optimism . " ( 7 ) It would be truer to say that in this stage of his development , he was lacking in audacity . In his eager search for advice , he had to strike a balance between the daring Seward who at this moment built entirely on his own power of political devination , and the cautious remainder of the Cabinet who had their ears to the ground trying their best to catch the note of authority in the rumblings of vox populi . For his own part , Lincoln began with two resolves : to go very cautiously ,  --  and not give something for nothing . Far from him , as yet , was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a gamble . However , just previous to the inauguration , he took a cautious step in Seward 's direction . Virginia , like all the other States of the upper South , was torn by the question which side to take . There was a " Union " party in Virginia , and a " Secession " party . A committee of leading Unionists conferred with Lincoln . They saw the immediate problem very much as Seward did . They believed that if time were allowed , the crisis could be tided over and the Union restored ; but the first breath of war would wreck their hopes . The condition of bringing about an adjustment was the evacuation of Sumter . Lincoln told them that if Virginia could be kept in the Union by the evacuation of Sumter , he would not hesitate to recall the garrison. ( 8 ) A few days later , despite what he had said in the inaugural , he repeated this offer . A convention was then sitting at Richmond in debate upon the relations of Virginia to the Union . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told another committee  --  he would evacuate Sumter and trust the recovery of the lower South to negotiation. ( 9 ) No results , so far as is known , came of either of those offers . During the first half of March , the Washington government marked time . The office-seekers continued to besiege the President . South Carolina continued to clamor for possession of Sumter . The Confederacy sent commissioners to Washington whom Lincoln refused to recognize . The Virginia Convention swayed this way and that . Seward went serenely about his business , confident that everything was certain to come his way soon or late . He went so far as to advise an intermediary to tell the Confederate Commissioners that all they had to do to get possession of Sumter was to wait . The rest of the Cabinet pressed their ears more tightly than ever to the ground . The rumblings of vox populi were hard to interpret . The North appeared to be in two minds . This was revealed the day following the inauguration , when a Republican Club in New York held a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faction wanted Lincoln to declare for a war-policy ; another wished the Club to content itself with a vote of confidence in the Administration . Each faction put its views into a resolution and as a happy device for maintaining harmony , both resolutions were passed. ( 10 ) The fragmentary , miscellaneous evidence of newspapers , political meetings , the talk of leaders , local elections , formed a confused clamor which each listener interpreted according to his predisposition . The members of the Cabinet in their relative isolation at Washington found it exceedingly difficult to make up their minds what the people were really saying . Of but one thing they were certain , and that was that they represented a minority party . Before committing themselves any way , it was life and death to know what portion of the North would stand by them. ( 11 ) At this point began a perplexity that was to torment the President almost to the verge of distraction . How far could he trust his military advisers ? Old General Scott was at the head of the army . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure . Should his military advice be accepted as final ? Scott informed Lincoln that Sumter was short of food and that any attempt to relieve it would call for a much larger force than the government could muster . Scott urged him to withdraw the garrison . Lincoln submitted the matter to the Cabinet . He asked for their opinions in writing. ( 12 ) Five advised taking Scott at his word and giving up all thought of relieving Sumter . There were two dissenters . The Secretary of the Treasury , Salmon Portland Chase , struck the key-note of his later political career by an elaborate argument on expediency . If relieving Sumter would lead to civil war , Chase was not in favor of relief ; but on the whole he did not think that civil war would result , and therefore , on the whole , he favored a relief expedition . One member of the Cabinet , Montgomery Blair , the Postmaster General , an impetuous , fierce man , was vehement for relief at all costs . Lincoln wanted to agree with Chase and Blair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the necessity under which it was done would not be fully understood ; that by many it would be construed as part of a voluntary policy , that at home it would discourage the friends of the Union , embolden its adversaries , and go far to insure to the matter a recognition abroad . Nevertheless , with the Cabinet five to two against him , with his military adviser against him , Lincoln put aside his own views . The government went on marking time and considering the credentials of applicants for country post-offices . By this time , Lincoln had thrown off the overpowering gloom which possessed him in the latter days at Springfield . It is possible he had reacted to a mood in which there was something of levity . His oscillation of mood from a gloom that nothing penetrated to a sort of desperate mirth , has been noted by various observers . And in 1861 he had not reached his final poise , that firm holding of the middle way ,  --  - which afterward fused his moods and made of him , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the month he had a famous interview with Colonel W. T. Sherman who had been President of the University of Louisiana and had recently resigned . Senator John Sherman called at the White House with regard to " some minor appointments in Ohio . " The Colonel went with him . When Colonel Sherman spoke of the seriousness of the Secession movement , Lincoln replied , " Oh , we 'll manage to keep house . " The Colonel was so offended by what seemed to him the flippancy of the President that he abandoned his intention to resume the military life and withdrew from Washington in disgust. ( 13 ) Not yet had Lincoln attained a true appreciation of the real difficulty before him . He had not got rid of the idea that a dispute over slavery had widened accidentally into a needless sectional quarrel , and that as soon as the South had time to think things over , it would see that it did not really want the quarrel . He had a queer idea that meanwhile he could hold a few points on the margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mouths of harbors , but leave vacant all Federal appointments within the Seceded States and ignore the absence of their representatives from Washington. ( 14 ) This marginal policy did not seem to him a policy of coercion ; and though he was beginning to see that the situation from the Southern point of view turned on the right of a State to resist coercion , he was yet to learn that idealistic elements of emotion and of political dogma were the larger part of his difficulty . Meanwhile , the upper South had been proclaiming its idealism . Its attitude was creating a problem for the lower South as well as for the North . The pro-slavery leaders had been startled out of a dream . The belief in a Southern economic solidarity so complete that the secession of any one Slave State would compel the secession of all the others , that belief had been proved fallacious . It had been made plain that on the economic issue , even as on the issue of sectional distrust , the upper South would not follow the lower South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislature of North Carolina , every courtesy was shown to them ; the Speaker of the House assured them of North Carolina 's sympathy and of her enduring friendliness ; but he was careful not to suggest an intention to secede , unless ( the condition that was destiny ! ) an attempt should be made to violate the sovereignty of the State by marching troops across her soil to attack the Confederates . Then , on the one issue of State sovereignty , North Carolina would leave the Union. ( 15 ) The Unionists in Virginia took similar ground . They wished to stay in the Union , and they were determined not to go out on the issue of slavery . Therefore they laid their heads together to get that issue out of the way . Their problem was to devise a compromise that would do three things : lay the Southern dread of an inundation of sectional Northern influence ; silence the slave profiteers ; meet the objections that had induced Lincoln to wreck the Crittenden Compromise . They felt that the first and second objectives would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri Compromise . But something more was needed , or again , Lincoln would refuse to negotiate . They met their crucial difficulty by boldly appealing to the South to be satisfied with the conservation of its present life and renounce the dream of unlimited Southern expansion . Their Compromise proposed a death blow to the filibuster and all he stood for . It provided that no new territory other than naval stations should be acquired by the United States on either side the Missouri Line without consent of a majority of the Senators from the States on the opposite side of that line. ( 16 ) As a solution of the sectional quarrel , to the extent that it had been definitely put into words , what could have been more astute ? Lincoln himself had said in the inaugural , " One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended ; while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended . That is the only substantial dispute . " In the same inaugural , he had pledged himself not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it now exists ; " and also had urged a vigorous enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law . He never had approved of any sort of emancipation other than purchase or the gradual operation of economic conditions . It was well known that slavery could flourish only on fresh land amid prodigal agricultural methods suited to the most ignorant labor . The Virginia Compromise , by giving to slavery a fixed area and abolishing its hopes of continual extensions into fresh land , was the virtual fulfillment of Lincoln 's demand . The failure of the Virginia Compromise is one more proof that a great deal of vital history never gets into words until after it is over . During the second half of March , Unionists and Secessionists in the Virginia Convention debated with deep emotion this searching new proposal . The Unionists had a fatal weakness in their position . This was the feature of the situation that had not hitherto been put into words . Lincoln had not been accurate when he said that the slavery question was " the only substantial dispute . " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a real thing ,  --  a mere device of the politicians to work up excitement . All the compromises he was ready to offer were addressed to that part of the South which was seeking to make an issue on slavery . They had little meaning for that other and more numerous part in whose thinking slavery was an incident . For this other South , the ideas which Lincoln as late as the middle of March did not bring into play were the whole story . Lincoln , willing to give all sorts of guarantees for the noninterference with slavery , would not give a single guarantee supporting the idea of State sovereignty against the idea of the sovereign power of the national Union . The Virginians , willing to go great lengths in making concessions with regard to slavery , would not go one inch in the way of admitting that their State was not a sovereign power included in the American Union of its own free will , and not the legitimate subject of any sort of coercion . The Virginia Compromise was really a profound new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of nationality from the issue of slavery was a storm signal . For a thoroughgoing nationalist like Lincoln , deep perplexities lay hidden in this full disclosure of the issue that was vital to the moderate South . Lincoln 's shifting of his mental ground , his perception that hitherto he had been oblivious of his most formidable opponent , the one with whom compromise was impossible , occurred in the second half of the month . As always , Lincoln kept his own counsel upon the maturing of a purpose in his own mind . He listened to every adviser  --  opening his office doors without reserve to all sorts and conditions  --  and silently , anxiously , struggled with himself for a decision . He watched Virginia ; he watched the North ; he listened  --  and waited . General Scott continued hopeless , though minor military men gave encouragement . And whom should the President trust-the tired old General who disagreed with him , or the eager young men who held views he would like to hold ? Many a time he was to ask himself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he again consulted the Cabinet. ( 17 ) A great deal of water had run under the mill since they gave their opinions on March sixteenth . The voice of the people was still a bewildering roar , but out of that roar most of the Cabinet seemed to hear definite words . They were convinced that the North was veering toward a warlike mood . The phrase " masterly inactivity , " which had been applied to the government 's course admiringly a few weeks before , was now being applied satirically . Republican extremists were demanding action . A subtle barometer was the Secretary of the Treasury . Now , as on the sixteenth , he craftily said something without saying it . After juggling the word " if , " he assumed his " if " to be a fact and concluded , " If war is to be the result , I perceive no reason why it may not best be begun in consequence of military resistance to the efforts of the Administration to sustain troops of the Union , stationed under authority of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of service . " This elaborate equivocation , which had all the force of an assertion , was Chase all over ! Three other ministers agreed with him except that they did not equivocate . One evaded . Of all those who had stood with Seward on the sixteenth , only one was still in favor of evacuation . Seward stood fast . This reversal of the Cabinet 's position , jumping as it did with Lincoln 's desires , encouraged him to prepare for action . But just as he was about to act his diffidence asserted itself . He authorized the preparation of a relief expedition but withheld sailing orders until further notice. ( 18 ) Oh , for Seward 's audacity ; for the ability to do one thing or another and take the consequences ! Seward had not foreseen this turn of events . He had little respect for the rest of the Cabinet , and had still to discover that the President , for all his semblance of vacillation , was a great man . Seward was undeniably vain . That the President with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet vote by counting noses  --  preposterous ! But that was just what this curiously simple-minded President had done . If he went on in his weak , amiable way listening to the time-servers who were listening to the bigots , what would become of the country ? And of the Secretary of State and his deep policies ? The President must be pulled up short  --  brought to his senses  --  taught a lesson or two . Seward saw that new difficulties had arisen in the course of that fateful March which those colleagues of his in the Cabinet  --  well-meaning , inferior men , to be sure  --  had not the subtlety to comprehend . Of course the matter of evacuation remained what it always had been , the plain open road to an ultimate diplomatic triumph . Who but a president out of the West , or a minor member of the Cabinet , would fail to see that ! But there were two other considerations which , also , his well-meaning colleagues were failing to allow for . While all this talk about the Virginia Unionists had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to negotiate , neither really had any control of its own game . They were card players with all the trumps out of their hands . Montgomery , the Confederate Congress , held the trumps . At any minute it could terminate all this make-believe of diplomatic independence , both at Washington and at Richmond . A few cannon shots aimed at Sumter , the cry for revenge in the North , the inevitable protest against coercion in Virginia , the convention blown into the air , and there you are  --  War ! And after all that , who knows what next ? And yet , Blair and Chase and the rest would not consent to slip Montgomery 's trumps out of her hands  --  the easiest thing in the world to do !  --  by throwing Sumter into her lap and thus destroying the pretext for the cannon shots . More than ever before , Seward would insist firmly on the evacuation of Sumter . But there was the other consideration , the really new turn of events . Suppose Sumter is evacuated ; suppose Montgomery has lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of coercion , what follows ? All along Seward had advocated a national convention to readjust all the matters " in dispute between the sections . " But what would such a convention discuss ? In his inaugural , Lincoln had advised an amendment to the Constitution " to the effect that the Federal government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the State , including that of persons held to service . " Very good ! The convention might be expected to accept this , and after this , of course , there would come up the Virginia Compromise . Was it a practical scheme ? Did it form a basis for drawing back into the Union the lower South ? Seward 's whole thought upon this subject has never been disclosed . It must be inferred from the conclusion which he reached , which he put into a paper entitled , Thoughts for the President 's Consideration , and submitted to Lincoln , April first . The Thoughts outlined a scheme of policy , the most startling feature of which was an instant , predatory , foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One was a political maxim in which Seward had unwavering faith . " A fundamental principle of politics , " he said , " is always to be on the side of your country in a war . It kills any party to oppose a war . When Mr. Buchanan got up his Mormon War , our people , Wade and Fremont , and The Tribune , led off furiously against it . I supported it to the immense disgust of enemies and friends . If you want to sicken your opponents with their own war , go in for it till they give it up . " ( 19 ) He was not alone among the politicians of his time , and some other times , in these cynical views . Lincoln has a story of a politician who was asked to oppose the Mexican War , and who replied , " I opposed one war ; that was enough for me . I am now perpetually in favor of war , pestilence and famine . " The second clue to Seward 's new policy of international brigandage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Southern expansionists who in the lower South at least formed so large a part of the political machine , who must somehow be lured back into the Union ; to whom the Virginia Compromise , as well as every other scheme of readjustment yet suggested , offered no allurement . Like Lincoln defeating the Crittenden Compromise , like the Virginians planning the last compromise , Seward remembered the filibusters and the dreams of the expansionists , annexation of Cuba , annexation of Nicaragua and all the rest , and he looked about for a way to reach them along that line . Chance had played into his hands . Already Napoleon III had begun his ill-fated interference with the affairs of Mexico . A rebellion had just taken place in San Domingo and Spain was supposed to have designs on the island . Here , for any one who believed in predatory war as an infallible last recourse to rouse the patriotism of a country , were pretexts enough . Along with these would go a raging assertion of the Monroe Doctrine and a bellicose attitude toward other European powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the lines of it all , could not any one glimpse a scheme for the expansion of the United States southward ? War with Spain over San Domingo ! And who , pray , held the Island of Cuba ! And what might not a defeated Spain be willing to do with Cuba ? And if France were driven out of Mexico by our conquering arms , did not the shadows of the future veil but dimly a grateful Mexico where American capital should find great opportunities ? And would not Southern capital in the nature of things , have a large share in all that was to come ? Surely , granting Seward 's political creed , remembering the problem he wished to solve , there is nothing to be wondered at in his proposal to Lincoln : " I would demand explanations from Spain and France , categorically , at once . " . . . And if satisfactory explanations were not received from Spain and France , " would convene Congress and declare war against them . " His purpose , he said , was to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or about slavery , for a question upon Union or Disunion . Sumter was to be evacuated " as a safe means for changing the issue , " but at the same time , preparations were to be made for a blockade of the Southern coast. ( 20 ) This extraordinary document administered mild but firm correction to the President . He was told that he had no policy , although under the circumstances , this was " not culpable " ; that there must be a single head to the government ; that the President , if not equal to the task , should devolve it upon some member of the Cabinet . The Thoughts closed with these words , " I neither seek to evade nor assume responsibility . " Like Seward 's previous move , when he sent Weed to Springfield , this other brought Lincoln to a point of crisis . For the second time he must render a decision that would turn the scale , that would have for his country the force of destiny . In one respect he did not hesitate . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This clashed with Lincoln 's character . Serene unscrupulousness met unwavering integrity . Here was one of those subjects on which Lincoln was not asking advice . As to ways and means , he was pliable to a degree in the hands of richer and wider experience ; as to principles , he was a rock . Seward 's whole scheme of aggrandizement , his magnificent piracy , was calmly waved aside as a thing of no concern . The most striking characteristic of Lincoln 's reply was its dignity . He did not , indeed , lay bare his purposes . He was content to point out certain inconsistencies in Seward 's argument ; to protest that whatever action might be taken with regard to the single fortress , Sumter , the question before the public could not be changed by that one event ; and to say that while he expected advice from all his Cabinet , he was none the less President , and in last resort he would himself direct the policy of the government. ( 21 ) Only a strong man could have put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritation . Not a word in Lincoln 's reply gives the least hint that condescension had been displayed . He is wholly unruffled , distant , objective . There is also a quiet tone of finality , almost the tone one might use in gently but firmly correcting a child . The Olympian impertinence of the Thoughts had struck out of Lincoln the first flash of that approaching masterfulness by means of which he was to ride out successfully such furious storms . Seward was too much the man of the world not to see what had happened . He never touched upon the Thoughts again . Nor did Lincoln . The incident was secret until Lincoln 's secretaries twenty-five years afterward published it to the world . But Lincoln 's lofty dignity on the first of April was of a moment only . When the Secretary of the Navy , Gideon Welles , that same day called on him in his offices , he was the easy-going , jovial Lincoln who was always ready half-humorously to take reproof from subordinates  --  as was evinced by his greeting to the Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " What have I done wrong ? " ( 22 ) Gideon Welles was a pugnacious man , and at that moment an angry man . There can be little doubt that his lips were tightly shut , that a stern frown darkened his brows . Grimly conscientious was Gideon Welles , likewise prosaic ; a masterpiece of literalness , the very opposite in almost every respect of the Secretary of State whom he cordially detested . That he had already found occasion to protest against the President 's careless mode of conducting business may be guessed  --  correctly  --  from the way he was received . Doubtless the very cordiality , the whimsical admission of loose methods , irritated the austere Secretary . Welles had in his hand a communication dated that same day and signed by the President , making radical changes in the program of the Navy Department . He had come to protest . " The President , " said Welles , " expressed as much surprise as I felt , that he had sent me such a document . He said that Mr. Seward with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day on a subject which he ( Seward ) had in hand and which he had been some time maturing ; that it was Seward 's specialty , to which he , the President , had yielded , but as it involved considerable details , he had left Mr. Seward to prepare the necessary papers . These papers he had signed , many of them without reading , for he had not time , and if he could not trust the Secretary of State , he knew not whom he could trust . I asked who were associated with Mr. Seward . ' No one , ' said the President , ' but these young men who were here as clerks to write down his plans and orders . ' Most of the work was done , he said , in the other room . " The President reiterated that they ( the changes in the Navy ) were not his instructions , though signed by him ; that the paper was an improper one ; that he wished me to give it no more consideration than I thought proper ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never been written . I could get no satisfactory explanation from the President of the origin of this strange interference which mystified him and which he censured and condemned more severely than myself . . . . Although very much disturbed by the disclosure , he was anxious to avoid difficulty , and to shield Mr. Seward , took to himself the whole blame . " Thus Lincoln began a role that he never afterward abandoned . It was the role of scapegoat Whatever went wrong anywhere could always be loaded upon the President . He appeared to consider it a part of his duty to be the scapegoat for the whole Administration . It was his way of maintaining trust , courage , efficiency , among his subordinates . Of those papers which he had signed without reading on April first , Lincoln was to hear again in still more surprising fashion six days thereafter . He was now at the very edge of his second crucial decision . Though the naval expedition was in preparation , he still hesitated over issuing orders to sail . The reply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conduct . What was it that kept him wavering at this eleventh hour ? Again , that impenetrable taciturnity which always shrouded his progress toward a conclusion , forbids dogmatic assertion . But two things are obvious : his position as a minority president , of which he was perhaps unduly conscious , caused him to delay , and to delay again and again , seeking definite evidence how much support he could command in the North ; the change in his comprehension of the problem before him-his perception that it was not an " artificial crisis " involving slavery alone , but an irreconcilable clash of social-political idealism  --  this disturbed his spirit , distressed , even appalled him . Having a truer insight into human nature than Seward had , he saw that here was an issue immeasurably less susceptible of compromise than was slavery . Whether , the moment he perceived this , he at once lost hope of any peaceable solution , we do not know . Just what he thought about the Virginia Compromise is still to seek . However , the nature of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element in a problem once his eyes were opened to the problem 's reality , forbid us to conclude that he took hope from Virginia . He now saw what , had it not been for his near horizon , he would have seen so long before , that , in vulgar parlance , he had been " barking up the wrong tree . " Now that he had located the right tree , had the knowledge come too late ? It is known that Seward , possibly at Lincoln 's request , made an attempt to bring together the Virginia Unionists and the Administration . He sent a special representative to Richmond urging the despatch of a committee to confer with the President . The strength of the party in the Convention was shown on April fourth when a proposed Ordinance of Secession was voted down , eighty-nine to forty-five . On the same day , the Convention by a still larger majority formally denied the right of the Federal government to coerce a State . Two days later , John B. Baldwin , representing the Virginia Unionists , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , drawn forth out of memory long afterward  --  some of the reporting being at second hand , the recollections of the recollections of the participants  --  are known to exist . The one fact clearly discernible is that Baldwin stated fully the Virginia position : that her Unionists were not nationalists ; that the coercion of any State , by impugning the sovereignty of all , would automatically drive Virginia out of the Union. ( 23 ) Lincoln had now reached his decision . The fear that had dogged him all along  --  the fear that in evacuating Sumter he would be giving something for nothing , that " it would discourage the friends of the Union , embolden its adversaries "  --  was in possession of his will . One may hazard the guess that this fear would have determined Lincoln sooner than it did , except for the fact that the Secretary of State , despite his faults , was so incomparably the strongest personality in the Cabinet . We have Lincoln 's own word for the moment and the detail that formed the very end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relieve and hold Fort Pickens , off the coast of Florida . To this , Seward saw no objection . In fact , he urged the relief of Pickens , hoping , as compensation , to get his way about Sumter . Assuming as he did that the Southern leaders were opportunists , he believed that they would not make an issue over Pickens , merely because it had not in the public eye become a political symbol . Orders had been sent to a squadron in Southern waters to relieve Pickens . Early in April news was received at Washington that the attempt had failed due to misunderstandings among the Federal commanders . Fearful that Pickens was about to fall , reasoning that whatever happened he dared not lose both forts , Lincoln became peremptory on the subject of the Sumter expedition . This was on April sixth . On the night of April sixth , Lincoln 's signatures to the unread despatches of the first of April , came home to roost . And at last , Welles found out what Seward was doing on the day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being got ready , still without sailing orders , a supplemental expedition was also preparing for the relief of Pickens . This was the business that Seward was contriving , that Lincoln would not explain , on April first . The order interfering with the Navy Department was designed to checkmate the titular head of the department . Furthermore , Seward had had the amazing coolness to assume that Lincoln would certainly accept his Thoughts and that the simple President need not hereinafter be consulted about details . He aimed to circumvent Welles and to make sure that the Sumter expedition , whether sailing orders were issued or not , should be rendered innocuous . The warship Powhatan , which was being got ready for sea at the Brooklyn Navy Yard , was intended by Welles for the Sumter expedition . One of those unread despatches signed by Lincoln , assigned it to the Pickens expedition . When the sailing orders from Welles were received , the commander of the Sumter fleet claimed the Powhatan . The Pickens commander refused to give it up . The latter telegraphed Seward that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicting " orders from Welles . The result was a stormy conference between Seward and Welles which was adjourned to the White House and became a conference with Lincoln . And then the whole story came out . Lincoln played the scapegoat , " took the whole blame upon himself , said it was carelessness , heedlessness on his part ; he ought to have been more careful and attentive . " But he insisted on immediate correction of his error , on the restoration of the Powhatan to the Sumter fleet . Seward struggled hard for his plan . Lincoln was inflexible . As Seward had directed the preparation of the Pickens expedition , Lincoln required him to telegraph to Brooklyn the change in orders . Seward , beaten by his enemy Welles , was deeply chagrined . In his agitation he forgot to be formal , forgot that the previous order had gone out in the President 's name , and wired curtly , " Give up the Powhatan . Seward . " This despatch was received just as the Pickens expedition was sailing . The commander of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he held that the one signed by the President took precedence over the others . He went on his way , with his great warship , to Florida . The Sumter expedition sailed without any powerful ship of war . In this strange fashion , chance executed Seward 's design . Lincoln had previously informed the Governor of South Carolina that due notice would be given , should he decide to relieve Sumter . Word was now sent that " an attempt will be made to supply Fort Sumter with provisions only ; and that if such attempt be not resisted , no effort to throw in men , arms or ammunition will be made without further notice , or in case of an attack upon the fort . " ( 25 ) Though the fleet was not intended to offer battle , it was supposed to be strong enough to force its way into the harbor , should the relief of Sumter be opposed . But the power to do so was wholly conditioned on the presence in its midst of the Powhatan . And the Powhatan was far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it was the turn of the Confederate government to confront a crisis . It , no less than Washington , had passed through a period of disillusion . The assumption upon which its chief politicians had built so confidently had collapsed . The South was not really a unit . It was not true that the secession of any one State , on any sort of issue , would compel automatically the secession of all the Southern States . North Carolina had exploded this illusion . Virginia had exploded it . The South could not be united on the issue of slavery ; it could not be united on the issue of sectional dread . It could be united on but one issue-State sovereignty , the denial of the right of the Federal Government to coerce a State . The time had come to decide whether the cannon at Charleston should fire . As Seward had foreseen , Montgomery held the trumps ; but had Montgomery the courage to play them ? There was a momentous debate in the Confederate Cabinet . Robert Toombs , the Secretary of State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lincoln 's growth , threw his influence on the side of further delay . He would not invoke that " final argument of kings , " the shotted cannon . " Mr. President , " he exclaimed , " at this time , it is suicide , murder , and will lose us every friend at the North . You will instantly strike a hornet 's nest which extends from mountain to ocean , and legions now quiet will swarm out and sting us to death . It is unnecessary ; it puts us in the wrong ; it is fatal . " But Toombs stood alone in the Cabinet . Orders were sent to Charleston to reduce Fort Sumter . Before dawn , April twelfth , the first shot was fired . The flag of the United States was hauled down on the afternoon of the thirteenth . Meanwhile the relieving fleet had arrived  --  without the Powhatan . Bereft of its great ship , it could not pass the harbor batteries and assist the fort . Its only service was to take off the garrison which by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteenth , Sumter was evacuated and the inglorious fleet sailed back to the northward . Lincoln at once accepted the gage of battle . On the fifteenth appeared his proclamation calling for an army of seventy-five thousand volunteers . Automatically , the upper South fulfilled its unhappy destiny . Challenged at last , on the irreconcilable issue , Virginia , North Carolina , Tennessee , Arkansas , seceded . The final argument of kings was the only one remaining . @# @# XVI " ON TO RICHMOND ! " It has been truly said that the Americans are an unmilitary but an intensely warlike nation . Seward 's belief that a war fury would sweep the country at the first cannon shot was amply justified . Both North and South appeared to rise as one man , crying fiercely to be led to battle . The immediate effect on Washington had not been foreseen . That historic clash at Baltimore between the city 's mob and the Sixth Massachusetts en route to the capital , was followed by an outburst of secession feeling in Maryland ; by an attempt to isolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; telegraph wires were cut . During several days Lincoln was entirely ignorant of what the North was doing . Was there an efficient general response to his call for troops ? Or was precious time being squandered in preparation ? Was it conceivable that the war fury was only talk ? Looking forth from the White House , he was a prisoner of the horizon ; an impenetrable mystery , it shut the capital in a ring of silence all but intolerable . Washington assumed the air of a beleaguered city . General Scott hastily drew in the small forces which the government had maintained in Maryland and Virginia . Government employees and loyal Washingtonians were armed and began to drill . The White House became a barracks . " Jim Lane , " writes delightful John Hay in his diary , which is always cool , rippling , sunny , no matter how acute the crisis , " Jim Lane marshalled his Kansas warriors today at Williard 's ; tonight ( they are in ) the East Room . " ( 1 ) Hay 's humor brightens the tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln a " yarn " that had been told to him by some charming women who had insisted on an interview ; they had heard from " a dashing Virginian " that inside forty-eight hours something would happen which would ring through the world . The ladies thought this meant the capture or assassination of the President . " Lincoln quietly grinned . " But Hay who plainly enjoyed the episode , charming women and all , had got himself into trouble . He had to do " some very dexterous lying to calm the awakened fears of Mrs. Lincoln in regard to the assassination suspicion . " Militia were quartered in the Capitol , and Pennsylvania Avenue was a drill ground . At the President 's reception , the distinguished politician C. C. Clay , " wore with a sublimely unconscious air three pistols and an ' Arkansas toothpick , ' and looked like an admirable vignette to twenty-five cents ' worth of yellow covered romance . " But Hay 's levity was all of the surface . Beneath it was intense anxiety . General Scott reported that the Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though he thought he was strong enough to hold out until relief should come . As the days passed and nothing appeared upon that inscrutable horizon while the telegraph remained silent , Lincoln became moodily distressed . One afternoon , " the business of the day being over , the executive office deserted , after walking the floor alone in silent thought for nearly a half-hour , he stopped and gazed long and wistfully out of the window down the Potomac in the direction of the expected ships ( bringing soldiers from New York ) ; and unconscious of other presence in the room , at length broke out with irrepressible anguish in the repeated exclamation , ' Why do n't they come ! Why do n't they come ! ' " ( 2 ) His unhappiness flashed into words while he was visiting those Massachusetts soldiers who had been wounded on their way to Washington . " I do n't believe there is any North . . . " he exclaimed . " You are the only Northern realities . " ( 3 ) But even then relief was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched down Broadway amid such an ovation as never before was given any regiment in America , had come by sea to Annapolis . At noon on April twenty-fifth , it reached Washington bringing , along with the welcome sight of its own bayonets , the news that the North had risen , that thousands more were on the march . Hay who met them at the depot went at once to report to Lincoln . Already the President had reacted to a " pleasant , hopeful mood . " He began outlining a tentative plan of action : blockade , maintenance of the safety of Washington , holding Fortress Monroe , and then to " go down to Charleston and pay her the little debt we are owing there . " ( 4 ) But this was an undigested plan . It had little resemblance to any of his later plans . And immediately the chief difficulties that were to embarrass all his plans appeared . He was a minority President ; and he was the Executive of a democracy . Many things were to happen ; many mistakes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be paid , ere Lincoln felt sufficiently sure of his support to enforce a policy of his own , defiant of opposition . Throughout the spring of 1861 his imperative need was to secure the favor of the Northern mass , to shape his policy with that end in view . At least , in his own mind , this seemed to be his paramount obligation . And so it was in the minds of his advisers . Lincoln was still in the pliable mood which was his when he entered office , which continued to be in evidence , except for sudden momentary disappearances when a different Lincoln flashed an instant into view , until another year and more had gone by . Still he felt himself the apprentice hand painfully learning the trade of man of action . Still he was deeply sensitive to advice . And what advice did the country give him ? There was one roaring shout dinning into his ears all round the Northern horizon- " On to Richmond ! " Following Virginia 's secession , Richmond had become the Confederate capital . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Richmond in July . " On to Richmond ! Forward to Richmond ! " screamed The Tribune . " The Rebel Congress must not be allowed to meet there on the 20th of July . By that date the place must be held by the national army . " The Times advised the resignation of the Cabinet ; it warned the President that if he did not give prompt satisfaction he would be superseded . Though Lincoln laughed at the threat of The Times to " depose " him , he took very seriously all the swiftly accumulating evidence that the North was becoming rashly impatient Newspaper correspondents at Washington talked to his secretaries " impertinently. " ( 5 ) Members of Congress , either carried away by the excitement of the hour or with slavish regard to the hysteria of their constituents , thronged to Washington clamoring for action . On purely political grounds , if on no other , they demanded an immediate advance into Virginia . Military men looked with irritation , if not with contempt , on all this intemperate popular fury . That grim Sherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month previous , put their feeling into words . Declining the offer of a position in the War Department , he wrote that he wished " the Administration all success in its almost impossible task of governing this distracted and anarchial people . " ( 6 ) In the President 's councils , General Scott urged delay , and the gathering of the volunteers into camps of instruction , their deliberate transformation into a genuine army . So inadequate were the resources of the government ; so loose and uncertain were the militia organizations which were attempting to combine into an army ; such discrepancies appeared between the nominal and actual strength of commands , between the places where men were supposed to be and the places where they actually were ; that Lincoln in his droll way compared the process of mobilization to shoveling a bushel of fleas across a barn floor. ( 7 ) From the military point of view it was no time to attempt an advance . Against the military argument , three political arguments loomed dark in the minds of the Cabinet ; there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the politicians who were to assemble in Congress , July fourth ; there was the term of service of the volunteers which had been limited by the proclamation to three months . Late in June , the Cabinet decided upon the political course , overruled the military advisers , and gave its voice for an immediate advance into Virginia . Lincoln accepted this rash advice . Scott yielded . General Irwin McDowell was ordered to strike a Confederate force that had assembled at Manassas. ( 8 ) On the fourth of July , the day Congress met , the government made use of a coup de theatre . It held a review of what was then considered a " grand army " of twenty-five thousand men . A few days later , the sensibilities of the Congressmen were further exploited . Impressionable members were " deeply moved , " when the same host in marching order passed again through the city and wheeled southward toward Virginia . Confident of victory , the Congressmen spent these days in high debate upon anything that took their fancy . When , a fortnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of them treated the Occasion as a picnic . They took horses , or hired vehicles , and away they went southward for a jolly outing on the day the Confederacy was to collapse . In the mind of the unfortunate General who commanded the expedition a different mood prevailed . In depression , he said to a friend , " This is not an army . It will take a long time to make an army . But his duty as a soldier forbade him to oppose his superiors ; the poor fellow could not proclaim his distrust of his army in public . " ( 9 ) Thoughtful observers at Washington felt danger in the air , both military and political . Sunday , July twenty-first , dawned clear . It was the day of the expected battle . A noted Englishman , setting out for the front as war correspondent of the London Times , observed " the calmness and silence of the streets of Washington , this early morning . " After crossing the Potomac , he felt that " the promise of a lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized to the fullest " ; and " the placid beauty of the scenery as we drove through the woods below Arlington " delighted him . And then about nine o'clock his thoughts abandoned the scenery . Through those beautiful Virginia woods came the distant roar of cannon . At the White House that day there was little if any alarm . Reports received at various times were construed by military men as favorable . These , with the rooted preconception that the army had to be successful , established confidence in a victory before nightfall . Late in the afternoon , the President relieved his tension by taking a drive . He had not returned when , about six o'clock , Seward appeared and asked hoarsely where he was . The secretaries told him . He begged them to find the President as quickly as possible . " Tell no one , " said he , " but the battle is lost . The army is in full retreat . " The news of the rout at Bull Run did not spread through Washington until close to midnight . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space before the Treasury was " a moving mass of humanity . Every man seemed to be asking every man he met for the latest news , while all sorts of rumors filled the air . A feeling of mingled horror and despair appeared to possess everybody . . . . Our soldiers came straggling into the city covered with dust and many of them wounded , while the panic that led to the disaster spread like a contagion through all classes . " The President did not share the panic . He " received the news quietly and without any visible sign of perturbation or excitement " ' ( 10 ) Now appeared in him the quality which led Herndon to call him a fatalist . All night long he sat unruffled in his office , while refugees from the stricken field  --  especially those overconfident Senators and Representatives who had gone out to watch the overthrow of the Confederates  --  poured into his ears their various and conflicting accounts of the catastrophe . During that long night Lincoln said almost nothing . Meanwhile , fragments of the routed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day Washington was possessed by a swarm of demoralized soldiers while a dreary rain settled over it . The silent man in the White House had forgotten for the moment his dependence upon his advisers . While the runaway Senators were talking themselves out , while the rain was sheeting up the city , he had reached two conclusions . Early in the morning , he formulated both . One conclusion was a general outline for the conduct of a long war in which the first move should be a call for volunteers to serve three years. ( 11 ) The other conclusion was the choice of a conducting general . Scott was too old . McDowell had failed . But there was a young officer , a West Pointer , who had been put in command of the Ohio militia , who had entered the Virginia mountains from the West , had engaged a small force there , and had won several small but rather showy victories . Young as he was , he had served in the Mexican War and was supposed to be highly accomplished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Washington to take command. ( 12 ) @# @# XVII . DEFINING THE ISSUE While these startling events were taking place in the months between Sumter and Bull Run , Lincoln passed through a searching intellectual experience . The reconception of his problem , which took place in March , necessitated a readjustment of his political attitude . He had prepared his arsenal for the use of a strategy now obviously beside the mark . The vital part of the first inaugural was its attempt to cut the ground from under the slave profiteers . Its assertion that nothing else was important , the idea that the crisis was " artificial , " was sincere . Two discoveries had revolutionized Lincoln 's thought . The discovery that what the South was in earnest about was not slavery but State sovereignty ; the discovery that the North was far from a unit upon nationalism . To meet the one , to organize the other , was the double task precipitated by the fall of Sumter . Not only as a line of attack , but also as a means of defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument for the sovereign reality of the national government . The effort to do this formed the silent inner experience behind the surging external events in the stormy months between April and July . It was governed by a firmness not paralleled in his outward course . As always , Lincoln the thinker asked no advice . It was Lincoln the administrator , painfully learning a new trade , who was timid , wavering , pliable in council . Behind the apprentice in statecraft , the lonely thinker stood apart , inflexible as ever , impervious to fear . The thinking which he formulated in the late spring and early summer of 1861 obeyed his invariable law of mental gradualness . It arose out of the deep places of his own past . He built up his new conclusion by drawing together conclusions he had long held , by charging them with his later experience , by giving to them a new turn , a new significance . Lincoln 's was one of those natures in which ideas have to become latent before they can be precipitated by outward circumstance into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become powerful at a crisis was one that he had long held in solution , that had permeated him without his formulating it , that had entwined itself with his heartstrings ; never was it merely a conscious act of the logical faculty . His characteristics as a lawyer  --  preoccupation with basal ideas , with ethical significance , with those emotions which form the ultimates of life  --  these always determined his thought . His idea of nationalism was a typical case . He had always believed in the reality of the national government as a sovereign fact . But he had thought little about it ; rather he had taken it for granted . It was so close to his desire that he could not without an effort acknowledge the sincerity of disbelief in it . That was why he was so slow in forming a true comprehension of the real force opposing him . Disunion had appeared to him a mere device of party strategy . That it was grounded upon a genuine , a passionate conception of government , one irreconcilable with his own , struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep offense . The literary statesman sprang again to life . He threw all the strength of his mind , the peculiar strength that had made him president , into a statement of the case for nationalism . His vehicle for publishing his case was the first message to Congress. ( 1 ) It forms an amazing contrast with the first inaugural . The argument over slavery that underlies the whole of the inaugural has vanished . The message does not mention slavery . From the first word to the last , it is an argument for the right of the central government to exercise sovereign power , and for the duty of the American people  --  to give their lives for the Union . No hint of compromise ; nought of the cautious and conciliatory tone of the inaugural . It is the blast of a trumpet  --  a war trumpet . It is the voice of a stern mind confronting an adversary that arouses in him no sympathy , no tolerance even , much less any thought of concession . Needless to insist that this adversary is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelievably tender . Though little of a theologian , he appreciated intuitively some metaphysical ideas ; he projected into politics the philosopher 's distinction between sin and the sinner . For all his hatred of the ideas which he held to be treason , he never had a vindictive impulse directed toward the men who accepted those ideas . Destruction for the idea , infinite clemency for the person  --  such was his attitude . It was the idea of disunion , involving as he believed , a misconception of the American government , and by implication , a misconception of the true function of all governments everywhere , against which he declared a war without recourse . The basis of his argument reaches back to his oration on Clay , to his assertion that Clay loved his country , partly because it was his country , even more because it was a free country . This idea ran through Lincoln 's thinking to the end . There was in him a suggestion of internationalism . At the full height of his power , in his complete maturity as a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life should be the brotherhood of the workers of all nations . No words of his are more significant than his remarks to passing soldiers in 1863 , such as , " There is more involved in this contest than is realized by every one . There is involved in this struggle the question whether your children and my children shall enjoy the privileges we have enjoyed . " And again , " I happen temporarily to occupy this White House . I am a living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my father 's child has . " ( 2 ) This idea , the idea that the " plain people " are the chief concern of government was the bed rock of all his political thinking . The mature , historic Lincoln is first of all a leader of the plain people  --  of the mass  --  as truly as was Cleon , or Robespierre , or Andrew Jackson . His gentleness does not remove him from that stern category . The latent fanaticism that is in every man , or almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith  --  so whimsically expressed  --  that God must have loved the plain people because he had made so many of them. ( 3 ) The basal appeal of the first message was in the words : " This is essentially a people 's contest . On the side of the Union it is a struggle for maintaining in the world that form and substance of government whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men ; to lift artificial weights from all shoulders ; to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all ; to afford all an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life . " ( 4 ) Not a war over slavery , not a war to preserve a constitutional system , but a war to assert and maintain the sovereignty of  --  " We , the People . " But how was it to be proved that this was , in fact , the true issue of the moment ? Here , between the lines of the first message , Lincoln 's deepest feelings are to be glimpsed . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had developed in himself a deep , slow-burning fervor that probably did much toward fusing him into the great Lincoln of history . But why ? What was there in that idea which should strike so deep ? Why was it not merely one view in a permissible disagreement over the interpretation of the Constitution ? Why did the cause of the people inspire its champion to regard the doctrine of State sovereignty as anti-christ ? Lincoln has not revealed himself on these points in so many words . But he has revealed himself plainly enough by implication . The clue is in that element of internationalism which lay at the back of his mind . There must be no misunderstanding of this element . It was not pointing along the way of the modern " international . " Lincoln would have fought Bolshevism to the death . Side by side with his assertion of the sanctity of the international bond of labor , stands his assertion of a sacred right in property and that capital is a necessity. ( 5 ) His internationalism was ethical , not opportunistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not out of a theorem , not from a constitutional interpretation , but from his overpowering commiseration for the mass of mankind . It was a practical matter . Here were poor people to be assisted , to be enriched in their estate , to be enlarged in spirit . The mode of reaching the result was not the thing . Any mode , all sorts of modes , might be used . What counted was the purpose to work relief , and the willingness to throw overboard whatever it might be that tended to defeat the purpose . His internationalism was but a denial of " my country right or wrong . " There can be little doubt that , in last resort , he would have repudiated his country rather than go along with it in opposition to what he regarded as the true purpose of government . And that was , to advance the welfare of the mass of mankind . He thought upon this subject in the same manner in which he thought as a lawyer , sweeping aside everything but what seemed to him the ethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " right " of a State to do this or that was a constitutional question only so long as it did not cross that other more universal " right , " the paramount " charter of liberty , " by which , in his view , all other rights were conditioned . He would impose on all mankind , as their basic moral obligation , the duty to sacrifice all personal likes , personal ambitions , when these in their permanent tendencies ran contrary to the tendency which he rated as paramount . Such had always been , and was always to continue , his own attitude toward slavery . No one ever loathed it more . But he never permitted it to take the first place in his thoughts . If it could be eradicated without in the process creating dangers for popular government he would rejoice . But all the schemes of the Abolitionists , hitherto , he had condemned as dangerous devices because they would strain too severely the fabric of the popular state , would violate agreements which alone made it possible . Therefore , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renunciation of this personal hope whenever , in whatever way , it threatened to make less effective the great democratic state which appeared to him the central fact of the world . The enlargement of his reasoning led him inevitably to an unsparing condemnation of the Virginian theory . One of his rare flashes of irritation was an exclamation that Virginia loyalty always had an " if . " ( 6 ) At this point , to make him entirely plain , there is needed another basic assumption which he has never quite formulated . However , it is so obviously latent in his thinking that the main lines are to be made out clearly enough . Building ever on that paramount obligation of all mankind to consider first the welfare of God 's plain people , he assumed that whenever by any course of action any congregation of men were thrown together and led to form any political unit , they were never thereafter free to disregard in their attitude toward that unit its value in supporting and advancing the general cause of the welfare of the plain people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine ! Certainly , as to individuals , classes , communities even , a doctrine that might easily become destructive . But it formed the basis of all Lincoln 's thought about the " majority " in America . Upon it would have rested his reply , had he ever made a reply , to the Virginia contention that while his theory might apply to each individual State , it could not apply to the group of States . He would have treated such a reply , whether fairly or unfairly , as a legal technicality . He would have said in substance : here is a congregation to be benefited , this great mass of all the inhabitants of all the States of the Union ; accident , or destiny , or what you will , has brought them together , but here they are ; they are moving forward , haltingly , irregularly , but steadily , toward fuller and fuller democracy ; they are part of the universal democratic movement ; their vast experiment has an international significance ; it is the hope of the " Liberal party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break it into Separate minor experiments ; to reduce the imposing promise of its example by making it seem unsuccessful , would be treason to mankind . Therefore , both on South and North , both on the Seceders he meant to fight and on those Northerners of whom he was not entirely sure , he aimed to impose the supreme immediate duty of proving to the world that democracy on a great scale could have sufficient vitality to maintain itself against any sort of attack . Anticipating faintly the Gettysburg oration , the first message contained these words : " And this issue embraces more than the fate of these United States . It presents to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic , or democracy  --  a government of the people by the same people  --  can or can not maintain its integrity against its own domestic foes . . . . Must a government of necessity be too strong for the liberties of its people or too weak to maintain its own existence ? " ( 7 ) He told Hay that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is upon us to prove that popular government is not an absurdity " ; " that the basal issue was whether or no the people could govern themselves . " ( 8 ) But all this elaborate reasoning , if it went no further , lacked authority . It was political speculation . To clothe itself with authority it had to discover a foundation in historic fact . The real difficulty was not what ought to have been established in America in the past , but what actually had been . Where was the warrant for those bold proposition  --  who " we , the people , " really were ; in what their sovereign power really consisted ; what was history 's voice in the matter ? To state an historic foundation was the final aim of the message . To hit its mark it had to silence those Northerners who denied the obligation to fight for the Union ; it had to oppose their " free love " ideas of political unity with the conception of an established historic government , one which could not be overthrown except through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written upon the exact location of sovereignty in the American federal State that it is difficult to escape the legalistic attitude , and to treat the matter purely as history . So various , so conflicting , and at times so tenuous , are the theories , that a flippant person might be forgiven did he turn from the whole discussion saying impatiently it was blind man 's buff . But on one thing , at least , we must all agree . Once there was a king over this country , and now there is no king . Once the British Crown was the sovereign , and now the Crown has receded into the distance beyond the deep blue sea . When the Crown renounced its sovereignty in America , what became of it ? Did it break into fragments and pass peacemeal to the various revolted colonies ? Was it transferred somehow to the group collectively ? These are the obvious theories ; but there are others . And the others give rise to subtler speculations . Who was it that did the actual revolting against the Crown  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who ? Troublesome questions these , with which Lincoln and the men of his time did not deal in the spirit of historical science . Their wishes fathered their thoughts . Southerners , practically without exception , held the theory of the disintegration of the Crown 's prerogative , its distribution among the States . The great leaders of Northern thought repudiated the idea . Webster and Clay would have none of it . But their own theories were not always consistent ; and they differed among themselves . Lincoln did the natural thing . He fastened upon the tendencies in Northern thought that supported his own faith . Chief among these was the idea that sovereignty passed to the general congregation of the inhabitants of the colonies  --  " we , the people "  --  because we , the people , were the real power that supported the revolt . He had accepted the idea that the American Revolution was an uprising of the people , that its victory was in a transfer of sovereign rights from an English Crown to an American nation ; that a new collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the first act of the struggle , and that it was to the Union that the Crown succumbed , to the Union that its prerogative passed . To put this idea in its boldest and its simplest terms was the crowning effort of the message . " The States have their status in the Union and they have no other legal status . If they break from this , they can only do so against law and by revolution . The Union , and not themselves separately , procured their independence and their liberty . By conquest or purchase , the Union gave each of them whatever of independence and liberty it has . The Union is older than any of the States , and in fact , it created them as States . Originally some dependent colonies made the Union , and in turn , the Union threw off this old dependence for them and made them States , such as they are . " ( 9 ) This first message completes the evolution of Lincoln as a political thinker . It is his third , his last great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus all the implications of his early life , laid the basis of his political significance ; the Cooper Union speech , summing up his conflict with Douglas , applied his thinking to the new issue precipitated by John Brown ; but in both these he was still predominantly a negative thinker , still the voice of an opposition . With the first message , he became creative ; he drew together what was latent in his earlier thought ; he discarded the negative ; he laid the foundation of all his subsequent policy . The breadth and depth of his thinking is revealed by the fulness with which the message develops the implications of his theory . In so doing , he anticipated the main issues that were to follow : his determination to keep nationalism from being narrowed into mere " Northernism " ; his effort to create an all-parties government ; his stubborn insistence that he was suppressing an insurrection , not waging external war ; his doctrine that the Executive , having been chosen by the entire people , was the one expression of the sovereignty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these exceptional " war powers " that are dormant in time of peace . Upon each of those issues he was destined to wage fierce battles with the politicians who controlled Congress , who sought to make Congress his master , who thwarted , tormented and almost defeated him . In the light of subsequent history the first message has another aspect besides its significance as political science . In its clear understanding of the implications of his attitude , it attains political second sight . As Lincoln , immovable , gazes far into the future , his power of vision makes him , yet again though in a widely different sense , the " seer in a trance , Seeing all his own mischance . " His troubles with Congress began at once . The message was received on July fourth , politely , but with scant response to its ideas . During two weeks , while Congress in its fatuousness thought that the battle impending in Virginia would settle things , the majority in Congress would not give assent to Lincoln 's view of what the war was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation changed . Fatuousness was puffed out like a candle in a wind . The rankest extremist saw that Congress must cease from its debates and show its hand ; must say what the war was about ; must inform the nation whether it did or did not agree with the President . On the day following Bull Run , Crittenden introduced this resolution : " That the present , deplorable civil war has been forced upon the country by the Disunionists of the Southern States , now in arms against the constitutional government , and in arms around the capital ; that in this national emergency , Congress , banishing all feelings of mere passion and resentment , will recollect only its duty to the whole country ; that this war is not waged on their part in any spirit of oppression or for any purpose of conquest or subjugation , or purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of these States , but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution , and to preserve the Union , with all the dignity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that as soon as these objects are accomplished , the war ought to cease . " This Crittenden Resolution was passed instantly by both Houses , without debate and almost without opposition . ( 10 ) Paradoxically , Bull Run had saved the day for Lincoln , had enabled him to win his first victory as a statesman . @# @# XVIII . THE JACOBIN CLUB The keen Englishman who had observed the beauty of the Virginian woods on " Bull Run Sunday , " said , after the battle was lost , " I hope Senator Wilson is satisfied . " He was sneering at the whole group of intemperate Senators none of whom had ever smelled powder , but who knew it all when it came to war ; who had done their great share in driving the President and the generals into a premature advance . Senator Wilson was one of those who went out to Manassas to see the Confederacy overthrown , that fateful Sunday . He was one of the most precipitate among those who fled back to Washington . On the way , driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he passed a carriage containing four Congressmen who were taking their time . Perhaps irritated by their coolness , he shouted to them to make haste . " If we were in as big a hurry as you are , " replied Congressman Riddle , scornfully , " we would . " These four Congressmen played a curiously dramatic part before they got back to Washington . So did a party of Senators with whom they joined forces . This other party , at the start , also numbered four . They had planned a jolly picnic  --  this day that was to prove them right in hurrying the government into battle !  --  and being wise men who knew how to take time by the forelock , they had taken their luncheon with them . From what is known of Washington and Senators , then as now , one may risk a good deal that the luncheon was worth while . Part of the tragedy of that day was the accidental break-up of this party with the result amid the confusion of a road crowded by pleasure-seekers , that two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other two , making the best of the disaster , continued southward through those beautiful early hours when Russell was admiring the scenery , their luncheon all to seek . The lucky men with the luncheon were the Senators Benjamin Wade and Zachary Chandler . Senator Trumbull and Senator Grimes , both on horseback , were left to their own devices . However , fortune was with them . Several hours later they had succeeded in getting food by the wayside and were resting in a grove of trees some distance beyond the village of Centerville . Suddenly , they suffered an appalling surprise ; happening to look up , they beheld emerging out of the distance , a stampede of men and horses which came thundering down the country road , not a hundred yards from where they sat . " We immediately mounted our horses , " as Trumbull wrote to his wife the next day , " and galloped to the road , by which time it was crowded , hundreds being in advance on the way to Centerville and two guns of Sherman 's battery having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd , not knowing what else to do . We fed our horses at Centerville and left there at six o'clock .... Came on to Fairfax Court House where we got supper and , leaving there at ten o'clock reached home at half past two this morning . . . . I am dreadfully disappointed and mortified. " ( 1 ) Meanwhile , what of those other gay picnickers , Senator Wade and Senator Chandler ? They drove in a carriage . Viewing the obligations of the hour much as did C. C. Clay at the President 's reception , they were armed . Wade had " his famous rifle " which he had brought with him to Congress , which at times in the fury of debate he had threatened to use , which had become a byword . These Senators seem to have ventured nearer to the front than did Trumbull and Grimes , and were a little later in the retreat At a " choke-up , " still on the far side of Centerville , their carriage passed the carriage of the four Congressmen  --  who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them " four of the largest navy revolvers . " All these men , whatever their faults or absurdities , were intrepid . The Congressmen , at least , were in no good humor , for they had driven through a regiment of three months men whose time expired that day and who despite the cannon in the distance were hurrying home . The race of the fugitives continued . At Centerville , the Congressmen passed Wade . Soon afterward Wade passed them for the second time . About a mile out of Fairfax Court House , " at the foot of a long down grade , the pike on the northerly side was fenced and ran along a farm . On the other side for a considerable distance was a wood , utterly impenetrable for men or animals , larger than cats or squirrels . " Here the Wade carriage stopped . The congressional carriage drove up beside it . The two blocked a narrow way where as in the case of Horatius at the bridge , " a thousand might well be stopped by three . " And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him . The " old Senator , his hat well back on his head , " sprang out of his carriage , his rifle in his hand , and called to the others , " Boys , we 'll stop this damned runaway . " And they did it . Only six of them , but they lined up across that narrow road ; presented their weapons and threatened to shoot ; seized the bridles of horses and flung the horses back on their haunches ; checked a panic-stricken army ; held it at bay , until just when it seemed they were about to be overwhelmed , military reserves hurrying out from Fairfax Court House , took command of the road . Cool , unpretentious Riddle calls the episode " Wade 's exploit , " and adds " it was much talked of . " The newspapers dealt with it extravagantly. ( 2 ) Gallant as the incident was , it was all the military service that " Ben " Wade and " Zach " Chandler  --  for thus they are known in history-over saw . But one may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view and on that of their friend Lyman Trumbull . Certain it is that none of the three thereafter had any doubts about putting the military men in their place . All the error of their own view previous to Bull Run was forgotten . Wade and Chandler , especially , when military questions were in dispute , felt that no one possibly could know more of the subject than did the men who stopped the rout in the narrow road beyond Fairfax . Three of those picnickers who missed their guess on Bull Run Sunday , Wade , Chandler and Trumbull , were destined to important parts in the stern years that were to come . Before the close of the year 1861 the three made a second visit to the army ; and this time they kept together . To that second visit momentous happenings may be traced . How it came about must be fully understood . Two of the three , Wade and Chandler , were temperamentally incapable of understanding Lincoln . Both were men of fierce souls ; each had but a very limited experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chandler , a prosperous manufacturer in Michigan . They were party men by instinct , blind to the faults of their own side , blind to the virtues of their enemies . They were rabid for the control of the government by their own organized machine . Of Chandler , in Michigan , it was said that he " carried the Republican organization in his breeches pocket " ; partly through control of the Federal patronage , which Lincoln frankly conceded to him , partly through a " judicious use of money . " ( 3 ) Chandler 's first clash with Lincoln was upon the place that the Republican machine was to hold in the conduct of the war . From the beginning Lincoln was resolved that the war should not be merely a party struggle . Even before he was inaugurated , he said that he meant to hold the Democrats " close to the Administration on the naked Union issue . " ( 4 ) He had added , " We must make it easy for them " to support the government " because we ca n't live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation of his attempt  --  so obvious between the lines of the first message  --  to create an all-parties government . This , Chandler violently opposed . Violence was always Chandler 's note , so much so that a scornful opponent once called him " Xantippe in pants . " Lincoln had given Chandler a cause of offense in McClellan 's elevation to the head of the army. * McClellan was a Democrat . There can be little doubt that Lincoln took the fact into account in selecting him . Shortly before , Lincoln had aimed to placate the Republicans by showing high honor to their popular hero , Fremont . * Strictly speaking he did not become head of the army until the retirement of Scott in November . Practically , he was supreme almost from the moment of his arrival in Washington . When the catastrophe occurred at Bull Run , Fremont was a major-general commanding the Western Department with headquarters at St. Louis . He was one of the same violent root-and-branch wing of the Republicans  --  the Radicals of a latter day  --  of which Chandler was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been revealed by Senator Baker in his startling pronouncement : " We of the North control the Union , and we are going to govern our own Union in our own way . " Chandler was soon to express it still more exactly , saying , " A rebel has sacrificed all his rights . He has no right to life , liberty or the pursuit of happiness . " ( 5 ) Here was that purpose to narrowing nationalism into Northernism , even to radicalism , and to make the war an outlet for a sectional ferocity , which Lincoln was so firmly determined to prevent . All things considered , the fact that on the day following Bull Run he did not summon the Republican hero to Washington , that he did summon a Democrat , was significant . It opened his long duel with the extremists . The vindictive Spirit of the extremists had been rebuffed by Lincoln in another way . Shortly after Bull Run , Wade and Chandler appealed to Lincoln to call out negro soldiers . Chandler said that he did not care whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lincoln 's refusal made another count in the score of the extremists against him. ( 6 ) During the late summer of 1861 , Chandler , Wade , Trumbull , were all busily organizing their forces for an attack on the Administration . Trumbull , indeed , seemed out of place in that terrible company . In time , he found that he was out of place . At a crucial moment he came over to Lincoln . But not until he had done yeoman service with Lincoln 's bitterest enemies . The clue to his earlier course was an honest conviction that Lincoln , though well-intentioned , was weak. ( 7 ) Was this the nemesis of Lincoln 's pliability in action during the first stage of his Presidency ? It may be . The firm inner Lincoln , the unyielding thinker of the first message , was not appreciated even by well-meaning men like Trumbull . The inner and the outer Lincoln were still disconnected . And the outer , in his caution , in his willingness to be instructed , in his opposition to extreme measures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution upon rashness . Throughout the late summer , Lincoln was the target of many attacks , chiefly from the Abolitionists . Somehow , in the previous spring , they had got it into their heads that at heart he was one of them , that he waited only for a victory to declare the war a crusade of abolition. ( 8 ) When the crisis passed and a Democrat was put at the head of the army , while Fremont was left in the relative obscurity of St. Louis , Abolition bitterness became voluble . The Crittenden Resolution was scoffed at as an " ill-timed revival of the policy of conciliation . " Threats against the Administration revived , taking the old form of demands for a wholly new Cabinet The keener-sighted Abolitionists had been alarmed by the first message , by what seemed to them its ominous silence as to slavery . Late in July , Emerson said in conversation , " If the Union is incapable of securing universal freedom , its disruption were as the breaking up of a frog-pond. " ( 9 ) An outcry was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves who in any way came into their hands . The Abolitionists found no solace in the First Confiscation Act which provided that an owner should lose his claim to a slave , had the slave been used to assist the Confederate government . They were enraged by an order , early in August , informing generals that it was the President 's desire " that all existing rights in all the States be fully respected and maintained ; in cases of fugitives from the loyal Slave States , the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law by the ordinary forms of judicial proceedings must be respected by the military authorities ; in the disloyal States the Confiscation Act of Congress must be your guide . " ( 10 ) Especially , the Abolitionists were angered because of Lincoln 's care for the forms of law in those Slave States that had not seceded . They vented their bitterness in a famous sneer  --  " The President would like to have God on his side , but he must have Kentucky . " A new temper was forming throughout the land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blend of all those elements of violent feeling which war inevitably releases ; it was the concentration of all these elements on the issue of Abolition as upon a terrible weapon ; it was the resurrection of that primitive blood-lust which lies dormant in every peaceful nation like a sleeping beast . This dreadful power rose out of its sleep and confronted , menacing , the statesman who of all our statesmen was most keenly aware of its evil , most determined to put it under or to perish in the attempt With its appearance , the deepest of all the issues involved , according to Lincoln 's way of thinking , was brought to a head . Was the Republic to issue from the war a worthy or an unworthy nation ? That was pretty definitely a question of whether Abraham Lincoln or , say , Zachary Chandler , was to control its policy . A vain , weak man precipitated the inevitable struggle between these two . Fremont had been flattered to the skies . He conceived himself a genius . He was persuaded that the party of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Vindictives , were lords of the ascendent . He mistook their volubility for the voice of the nation . He determined to defy Lincoln . He issued a proclamation freeing the slaves of all who had " taken an active part " with the enemies of the United States in the field . He set up a " bureau of abolition . " Lincoln first heard of Fremont 's proclamation through the newspapers . His instant action was taken in his own extraordinarily gentle way . " I think there is great danger , " he wrote , " that the closing paragraph ( of Fremont 's proclamation ) in relation to the confiscation of property and the liberating of slaves of traitorous owners , will alarm our Southern Union friends and turn them against us ; perhaps ruin our rather fair prospect for Kentucky . Allow me , therefore , to ask that you will , as of your own motion , modify that paragraph so as to conform " to the Confiscation Act . He added , " This letter is written in the Spirit of caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the man to understand instruction of this sort . He would make no compromise with the President . If Lincoln wished to go over his head and rescind his order let him do so-and take the consequences . Lincoln quietly did so . His battle with the Vindictives was on . For a moment it seemed as if he had destroyed his cause . So loud was the outcry of the voluble people , that any one might have been excused momentarily for thinking that all the North had risen against him . Great meetings of protest were held . Eminent men  --  even such fine natures as Bryant  --  condemned his course . In the wake of the incident , when it was impossible to say how significant the outcry really was , Chandler , who was staunch for Fremont , began his active interference with the management of the army . McClellan had insisted on plenty of time in which to drill the new three-year recruits who were pouring into Washington . He did not propose to repeat the experience of General McDowell . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He , Wade and Trumbull combined , attempting to bring things to pass in a way to suit themselves and their faction . To these men and their followers , clever young Hay gave the apt name of " The Jacobin Club . " They began their campaign by their second visit to the army . Wade was their chief spokesman . He urged McClellan to advance at once ; to risk an unsuccessful battle rather than continue to stand still ; the country wanted something done ; a defeat could easily be repaired by the swarming recruits. ( 12 ) This callous attitude got no response from the Commanding General . The three Senators turned upon Lincoln . " This evening , " writes Hay in his diary on October twenty-sixth , " the Jacobin Club represented by Trumbull , Chandler and Wade , came out to worry the Administration into a battle . The agitation of the summer is to be renewed . The President defended McClellan 's deliberateness . The next night we went over to Seward 's and found Chandler and Wade there . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; defeat would be no worse than delay ; " and a great deal more trash . " But Lincoln was not to be moved . He and Hay called upon McClellan . The President deprecated this new manifestation of popular impatience , but said it was a reality and should be taken into account . " At the same time , General , " said he , " you must not fight until you are ready . " ( 13 ) At this moment of extreme tension occurred the famous incident of the seizure of the Confederate envoys , Mason and Slidell , who were passengers on the British merchant ship , the Trent . These men had run the blockade which had now drawn its strangling line along the whole coast of the Confederacy ; they had boarded the Trent at Havana , and under the law of nations were safe from capture . But Captain Wilkes of the United States Navy , more zealous than discreet , overhauled the Trent and took off the two Confederates . Every thoughtless Northerner went wild with joy . At last the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy so far forgot himself as to telegraph to Wilkes " Congratulate you on the great public service you have rendered in the capture of the rebel emissaries. " ( 14 ) Chandler promptly applauded the seizure and when it was suggested that perhaps the envoys should be released he at once arrayed himself in opposition. ( 15 ) With the truculent Jacobins ready to close battle should the government do its duty , with the country still echoing to cheers for Fremont and hisses for the President , with nothing to his credit in the way of military success , Lincoln faced a crisis . He was carried through the crisis by two strong men . Sumner , head and front of Abolitionism but also a great lawyer , came at once to his assistance . And what could a thinking Abolitionist say after that ! Seward skilfully saved the face of the government by his management of the negotiation . The envoys were released and sent to England . It was the only thing to do , but Chandler and all his sort had opposed it . The Abolition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips in a speech at New York denounced the Administration as having no definite purpose in the war , and was interrupted by frantic cheers for Fremont . McClellan , patiently drilling his army , was , in the eyes of the Jacobins , doing nothing . Congress had assembled . There was every sign that troubled waters lay just ahead . @# @# XIX . THE JACOBINS BECOME INQUISITORS The temper animating Hay 's " Jacobins " formed a new and really formidable danger which menaced Lincoln at the close of 1861 . But had he been anything of an opportunist , it would have offered him an unrivaled opportunity . For a leader who sought personal power , this raging savagery , with its triple alliance of an organized political machine , a devoted fanaticism , and the war fury , was a chance in ten thousand . It led to his door the steed of militarism , shod and bridled , champing upon the bit , and invited him to leap into the saddle . Ten words of acquiescence in the program of the Jacobins , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command . The fallacy that politics are primarily intellectual decisions upon stated issues , the going forth of the popular mind to decide between programs presented to it by circumstances , receives a brilliant refutation in the course of the powerful minority that was concentrating around the three great " Jacobins . " The subjective side of politics , also the temperamental side , here found expression . Statecraft is an art ; creative statesmen are like other artists . Just as the painter or the poet , seizing upon old subjects , uses them as outlets for his particular temper , his particular emotion , and as the temper , the emotion are what counts in his work , so with statesmen , with Lincoln on the one hand , with Chandler at the opposite extreme . The Jacobins stood first of all for the sudden reaction of bold fierce natures from a long political repression . They had fought their way to leadership as captains of an opposition . They were artists who had been denied an opportunity of expression . By a sudden turn of fortune , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fighters . Battle for them was an end in itself . The thought of Conquest sang to them like the morning stars . Had they been literary men , their favorite poetry would have been the sacking of Troy town . Furthermore , they were intensely provincial . Undoubted as was their courage , they had also the valor of ignorance . They had the provincial 's disdain for the other side of the horizon , his unbounded confidence in his ability to whip all creation . Chandler , scornfully brushing aside a possible foreign war , typified their mood . And in quiet veto of all their hopes rose against them the apparently easy-going , the smiling , story-telling , unrevengeful , new man at the White House . It is not to be wondered that they spent the summer laboring to build up a party against him , that they turned eagerly to the new session of Congress , hoping to consolidate a faction opposed to Lincoln . His second message ( 1 ) , though without a word of obvious defiance , set him squarely against them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the strangest period of Lincoln 's career . Although the two phases of him , the outer and the inner , were , in point of fact , moving rapidly toward their point of fusion , apparently they were further away than ever before . Outwardly , his most conspicuous vacillations were in this winter and in the following spring . Never before or after did he allow himself to be overshadowed so darkly by his advisers in all the concerns of action . In amazing contrast , in all the concerns of thought , he was never more entirely himself . The second message , prepared when the country rang with what seemed to be a general frenzy against him , did not give ground one inch . This was all the more notable because his Secretary of War had tried to force his hand . Cameron had the reputation of being about the most astute politician in America . Few people attributed to him the embarrassment of principles . And Cameron , in the late autumn , after closely observing the drift of things , determined that Fremont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do was to come out for Abolition as a war policy . In a word , he decided to go over to the Jacobins . He put into his annual report a recommendation of Chandler 's plan for organizing an army of freed slaves and sending it against the Confederacy . Advanced copies of this report had been sent to the press before Lincoln knew of it . He peremptorily ordered their recall , and the exclusion of this suggestion from the text of the report. ( 2 ) On the heels of this refusal to concede to Chandler one of his cherished schemes , the second message was sent to Congress . The watchful and exasperated Jacobins found abundant offense in its omissions . On the whole great subject of possible emancipation it was blankly silent . The nearest it came to this subject was one suggestion which applied only to those captured slaves who had been forfeited by the disloyal owners through being employed to assist the Confederate government Lincoln advised that after receiving their freedom they be sent out of the country and colonized " at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Beyond this there was nothing bearing on the slavery question except the admonition  --  so unsatisfactory to Chandler and all his sort  --  that while " the Union must be preserved , and hence all indispensable means must be employed , " Congress should " not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme measures , which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal , are indispensable . " Lincoln was entirely clear in his own mind that there was but one way to head off the passion of destruction that was rioting in the Jacobin temper . " In considering the policy to be adopted in suppressing the insurrection , I have been anxious and careful that the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle . I have , therefore , in every case , thought it proper to keep the integrity of the Union prominent as the primary object of the contest on our part , leaving all questions which are not of vital military importance to the more deliberate action of the Legislature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " disloyal portion of the American people , " not as an external struggle between the North and the South . Finally , the culmination of the message was a long elaborate argument upon the significance of the war to the working classes . His aim was to show that the whole trend of the Confederate movement was toward a conclusion which would " place capital on an equal footing with , if not above , labor , in the structure of government . " Thus , as so often before , he insisted on his own view of the significance in American politics of all issues involving slavery  --  their bearing on the condition of the free laborer . In a very striking passage , often overlooked , he ranked himself once more , as first of all , a statesman of " the people , " in the limited class sense of the term . " Labor is prior to and independent of capital . Capital is only the fruit of labor and could never have existed if labor had not first existed . Labor is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But so far is he from any revolutionary purpose , that he adds immediately , " Capital has its rights which are as worthy of protection as any other rights . " His crowning vision is not communism . His ideal world is one of universal opportunity , with labor freed of every hindrance , with all its deserving members acquiring more and more of the benefits of property . Such a message had no consolation for Chandler , Wade , or , as he then was , for Trumbull . They looked about for a way to retaliate . And now two things became plain . That " agitation of the summer " to which Hay refers , had borne fruit , but not enough fruit . Many members of Congress who had been swept along by the President 's policy in July had been won over in the reaction against him and were ripe for manipulation ; but it was not yet certain that they held the balance of power in Congress . To lock horns with the Administration , in December , would have been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wade avoided it . Instead , they devised an astute plan of campaign . Trumbull was Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , and in that important position would bide his time to bring pressure to bear on the President through his influence upon legislation . Wade and Chandler would go in for propaganda . But they would do so in disguise . What more natural than that Congress should take an active interest in the army , should wish to do all in its power to " assist " the President in rendering the army-efficient . For that purpose it was proposed to establish a joint committee of the two Houses having no function but to look into military needs and report to Congress . The proposal was at once accepted and its crafty backers secured a committee dominated entirely by themselves . Chandler was a member ; Wade became Chairman. ( 3 ) This Committee on the Conduct of the War became at once an inquisition . Though armed with no weapon but publicity , its close connection with congressional intrigue , its hostility to the President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any charges it chose to bring , clothed it indirectly with immense power . Its inner purpose may be stated in the words of one of its members , " A more vigorous prosecution of the war and less tenderness toward slavery . " ( 4 ) Its mode of procedure was in constant interrogation of generals , in frequent advice to the President , and on occasion in threatening to rouse Congress against him. ( 5 ) A session of the Committee was likely to be followed by a call on the President of either Chandler or Wade . The Committee began immediately summoning generals before it to explain what the army was doing . And every general was made to understand that what the Committee wanted , what Congress wanted , what the country wanted , was an advance  --  " something doing " as soon as possible . And now appeared another characteristic of the mood of these furious men . They had become suspicious , honestly suspicious . This suspiciousness grew with their power and was rendered frantic by being crossed . Whoever disagreed with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradicted their views was at once an evidence of treason . The earliest display of this eagerness to see traitors in every bush concerned a skirmish that took place at Ball 's Bluff in Virginia . It was badly managed and the Federal loss , proportionately , was large . The officer held responsible was General Stone . Unfortunately for him , he was particularly obnoxious to the Abolitionists ; he had returned fugitive slaves ; and when objection was made by such powerful Abolitionists as Governor Andrew of Massachusetts , Stone gave reign to a sharp tongue . In the early days of the session , Roscoe Conkling told the story of Ball 's Bluff for the benefit of Congress in a brilliant , harrowing speech . In a flash the rumor spread that the dead at Ball 's Bluff were killed by design , that Stone was a traitor , that  --  perhaps !  --  who could say ?  --  there were bigger traitors higher up . Stone was summoned before the Inquisition. ( 6 ) While Stone was on the rack , metaphorically , while the Committee was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaint him with the evidence against him , intimating that they were able to convict him of treason , between the fifth and the eleventh of January a crisis arose in the War Office . Cameron had failed to ingratiate himself with the rising powers . Old political enemies in Congress were implacable . Scandals in his Department gave rise to sweeping charges of peculation . There is scarcely another moment when Lincoln 's power was so precarious . In one respect , in their impatience , the Committee reflected faithfully the country at large . And by the irony of fate McClellan at this crucial hour , had fallen ill . After waiting for his recovery during several weeks , Lincoln ventured with much hesitation to call a conference of generals. ( 7 ) They were sitting during the Stone investigation , producing no result except a distraction in councils , devising plans that were thrown over the moment the Commanding General arose from his bed . A vote in Congress a few days previous had amounted to a censure of the Administration . It was taken upon the Crittenden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who had voted for it in July , so many now abandoned the Administration that this resolution , the clear embodiment of Lincoln 's policy , was laid on the table , seventy-one to sixty-five. ( 8 ) Lincoln 's hope for an all-parties government was receiving little encouragement The Democrats were breaking into factions , while the control of their party organization was falling into the hands of a group of inferior politicians who were content to " play politics " in the most unscrupulous fashion . Both the Secretary of War and the Secretary of State had authorized arbitrary arrests . Men in New York and New England had been thrown into prison . The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus had been denied them on the mere belief of the government that they were conspiring with its enemies . Because of these arrests , sharp criticism was being aimed at the Administration both within and without Congress . For all these reasons , the government at Washington appeared to be tottering . Desperate remedies seemed imperative . Lincoln decided to make every concession he could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw over Cameron ; he compelled him to resign though he saved his face by appointing him minister to Russia . But who was to take his place ? At this critical moment , the choice of a new Secretary of War was a political problem of exacting difficulty . Just why Lincoln chose a sullen , dictatorial lawyer whose experience in no way prepared him for the office , has never been disclosed . Two facts appear to explain it . Edwin M. Stanton was temperamentally just the man to become a good brother to Chandler and Wade . Both of them urged him upon Lincoln as successor to Cameron. ( 9 ) Furthermore , Stanton hitherto had been a Democrat . His services in Buchanan 's Cabinet as Attorney-General had made him a national figure . Who else linked the Democrats and the Jacobins ? However , for almost any one but Lincoln , there was an objection that it would have been hard to overcome . No one has ever charged Stanton with politeness . A gloomy excitable man , of uncertain health , temperamentally an over-worker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was capable of insufferable rudeness  --  one reason , perhaps , why Chandler liked him . He and Lincoln had met but once . As associate council in a case at Cincinnati , three years before , Lincoln had been treated so contemptuously by Stanton that he had returned home in pained humiliation . Since his inauguration , Stanton had been one of his most vituperative critics . Was this insolent scold to be invited into the Cabinet ? Had not Lincoln at this juncture been in the full tide of selflessness , surely some compromise would have been made with the Committee , a secretary found less offensive personally to the President . Lincoln disregarded the personal consideration . The candidate of Chandler and Wade became secretary . It was the beginning of an intimate alliance between the Committee and the War Office . Lincoln had laid up for himself much trouble that he did not foresee . The day the new Secretary took office , he received from the Committee a report upon General Stone : ( 10 ) Subsequently , in the Senate , Wade denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 ) Doubtless the statement was technically correct . Nevertheless , there can be no doubt that the inquisitors were wholly in sympathy with the Secretary when , shortly afterward , Stone was seized upon Stanton 's order , conveyed to a fortress and imprisoned without trial . This was the Dreyfus case of the Civil War . Stone was never tried and never vindicated . He was eventually released upon parole and after many tantalizing disappointments permitted to rejoin the army . What gives the event significance is its evidence of the power , at that moment , of the Committee , and of the relative weakness of the President . Lincoln 's eagerness to protect condemned soldiers survives in many anecdotes . Hay confides to his diary that he was sometimes " amused at the eagerness with which the President caught at any fact which would justify " clemency . And yet , when Stanton informed him of the arrest of Stone , he gloomily acquiesced . " I hope you have good reasons for it , " he said . Later he admitted that he knew very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's release . Lincoln had his own form of ruthlessness . The selfless man , by dealing with others in the same extraordinary way in which he deals with himself , may easily under the pressure of extreme conditions become impersonal in his thinking upon duty . The morality of such a state of mind is a question for the philosopher . The historian must content himself with pointing out the only condition that redeems it  --  if anything redeems it The leader who thinks impersonally about others and personally about himself-what need among civilized people to characterize him ? Borgia , Louis XIV , Napoleon . If we are ever to pardon impersonal thinking it is only in the cases of men who begin by effacing themselves . The Lincoln who accepted Stanton as a Cabinet officer , who was always more or less overshadowed by the belief that in saving the government he was himself to perish , is explicable , at least , when individual men became for him , as at times they did , impersonal factors in a terrible dream . There are other considerations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interfere in behalf of Stone . The first four months of 1862 are not only his feeblest period as a ruler , the period when he was barely able to hold his own , but also the period when he was least definite as a personality , when his courage and his vitality seemed ebbing tides . Again , his spirit was in eclipse . Singularly enough , this was the darkness before the dawn . June of 1862 saw the emergence , with a suddenness difficult to explain , of the historic Lincoln . But in January of that year he was facing downward into the mystery of his last eclipse . All the dark places of his heredity must be searched for clues to this strange experience . There are moments , especially under strain of a personal bereavement that fell upon him in February , when his will seemed scarcely a reality ; when , as a directing force he may be said momentarily to have vanished ; when he is hardly more than a ghost among his advisers . The far-off existence of weak old Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , even our Dreyfus case drew from Lincoln another display of that settled conviction of his that part of his function was to be scapegoat . " I serve , " which in a way might be taken as his motto always , was peculiarly his motto , and likewise his redemption , in this period of his weakness . The enemies of the Committee in Congress took the matter up and denounced Stanton . Thereupon , Wade flamed forth , criticizing Lincoln for his leniency , venting his fury on all those who were tender of their enemies , storming that " mercy to traitors is cruelty to loyal men . " ( 12 ) Lincoln replied neither to Wade nor to his antagonists ; but , without explaining the case , without a word upon the relation to it of the Secretary and the Committee , he informed the Senate that the President was alone responsible for the arrest and imprisonment of General Stone. ( 13 ) @# @# XX . IS CONGRESS THE PRESIDENT 'S MASTER ? The period of Lincoln 's last eclipse is a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not cease thinking upon the deep theoretical distinctions that were separating him by a steadily widening chasm from the most powerful faction in Congress . In fact , his mental powers were , if anything , more keen than ever before . Probably , it was the very clearness of the mental vision that enfeebled him when it came to action . He saw his difficulties with such crushing certainty . During this trying period there is in him something of Hamlet . The reaction to his ideas , to what is either expressed or implied , in the first and second messages , was prompt to appear . The Jacobins did not confine their activities within the scope of the terrible Committee . Wade and Chandler worked assiduously undermining his strength in Congress . Trumbull , though always less extreme than they , was still the victim of his delusion that Lincoln was a poor creature , that the only way to save the country was to go along with those grim men of strength who dominated the Committee . In January , a formidable addition appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a speech in the House that marks a chapter . It brought to a head a cloud of floating opposition and dearly defined an issue involving the central proposition in Lincoln 's theory of the government . The Constitution of the United States , in its detailed provisions , is designed chiefly to meet the exigencies of peace . With regard to the abnormal conditions of war , it is relatively silent . Certain " war powers " are recognized but not clearly defined ; nor is it made perfectly plain what branch of the government possesses them . The machinery for their execution is assumed but not described  --  as when the Constitution provides that the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus are to be suspended only in time of war , but does not specify by whom , or in what way , the suspension is to be effected . Are those undefined " war powers , " which are the most sovereign functions of our government , vested in Congress or in the President ? Lincoln , from the moment he defined his policy , held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vested in the President . By implication , at least , this idea is in the first message . Throughout the latter part of 1861 , he put the theory into practice . Whatever seemed to him necessary in a state of war , he did , even to the arresting of suspected persons , refusing them the privilege-of the habeas corpus , and retaining them in prison without trial . During 1861 , he left the exercise of this sovereign authority to the discretion of the two Secretaries of War and of State . Naturally , the Abolitionists , the Jacobins , the Democratic machine , conscientious believers in the congressional theory of the government , every one who for any reason , wanted to hit the Administration , united in a chorus of wrath over arbitrary arrests . The greatest orator of the time , Wendell Phillips , the final voice of Abolition , flayed the government in public speeches for reducing America to an absolute despotism . Trumbull introduced into the Senate a resolution calling upon the President for a statement of the facts as to what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrests was but the prelude to the play . The real issue was the theory of the government . Where in last analysis does the Constitution place the ultimate powers of sovereignty , the war powers ? In Congress or in the President ? Therefore , in concrete terms , is Congress the President 's master , or is it only one branch of the government with a definite but united activity of its own , without that sweeping sovereign authority which in course of time has been acquired by its parent body , the Parliament of Great Britain ? On this point Lincoln never wavered . From first to last , he was determined not to admit that Congress had the powers of Parliament . No sooner had the politicians made out this attitude than their attack on it began . It did not cease until Lincoln 's death . It added a second constitutional question to the issues of the war . Not only the issue whether a State had a right to secede , but also the issue of the President 's possession of the war powers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own party , to say nothing of the violent Democrats , exhausted their rhetoric denouncing Lincoln 's position . They did not deny themselves the delights of the sneer . Senator Grimes spoke of a call on the President as an attempt " to approach the footstool of power enthroned at the other end of the Avenue . " ( 2 ) Wade expanded the idea : " We ought to have a committee to wait on him whenever we send him a bill , to know what his royal pleasure is with regard to it . . . . We are told that some gentlemen . . . have been to see the President . Some gentlemen are very fortunate in that respect . Nobody can see him , it seems , except some privileged gentlemen who are charged with his constitutional conscience . " ( 3 ) As Lincoln kept his doors open to all the world , as no one came and went with greater freedom than the Chairman of the Committee , the sneer was-what one might expect of the Committee . Sumner said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government in the exercise of the rights of war . " Disagreement with him , he treated with unspeakable disdain : " Born in ignorance and pernicious in consequence , it ought to be received with hissings of contempt , and just in proportion as it obtains acceptance , with execration. " ( 4 ) Henry Wilson declared that , come what might , the policy of the Administration would be shaped by the two Houses . " I had rather give a policy to the President of the United States than take a policy from the President of the United States . " ( 5 ) Trumbull thundered against the President 's theory as the last word in despotism. ( 6 ) Such is the mental perspective in which to regard the speech of Stevens of January 22 , 1862 . With masterly clearness , he put his finger on the heart of the matter : the exceptional problems of a time of war , problems that can not be foreseen and prepared for by anticipatory legislation , may be solved in but one way , by the temporary creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America as of ancient Rome ; so far , most people are agreed ; but this extraordinary function must not be vested in the Executive ; on the contrary , it must be , it is , vested in the Legislature . Stevens did not hesitate to push his theory to its limit . He was not afraid of making the Legislature in time of war the irresponsible judge of its own acts . Congress , said he , has all possible powers of government , even the dictator 's power ; it could declare itself a dictator ; under certain circumstances he was willing that it should do so. ( 7 ) The intellectual boldness of Lincoln was matched by an equal boldness . Between them , he and Stevens had perfectly defined their issue . Granted that a dictator was needed , which should it be  --  the President or Congress ? In the hesitancy at the White House during the last eclipse , in the public distress and the personal grief , Lincoln withheld himself from this debate . No great utterances break the gloom of this period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevens is to be found . Buried in the forgotten portions of the Congressional Globe is a speech that surely was inspired-or , if not directly inspired , so close a reflection of the President 's thinking that it comes to the same thing at the end . Its author , or apparent author , was one of the few serene figures in that Thirty-Seventh Congress which was swept so pitilessly by epidemics of passion . When Douglas , after coming out valiantly for the Union and holding up Lincoln 's hands at the hour of crisis , suddenly died , the Illinois Legislature named as his successor in the Senate , Orville Henry Browning . The new Senator was Lincoln 's intimate friend . Their points of view , their temperaments were similar . Browning shared Lincoln 's magnanimity , his hatred of extremes , his eagerness not to allow the war to degenerate into revolution . In the early part of 1862 he was Lincoln 's spokesman in the Senate . Now that the temper of Wade and Chandler , the ruthlessness that dominated the Committee , had drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their thinking had been organized by a fearless mind ; there was urgent need for a masterly reply . Did Lincoln feel unequal , at the moment , to this great task ? Very probably he did . Anyhow , it was Browning who made the reply , ( 8 ) a reply so exactly in his friend 's vein , that  --  there you are ! His aim was to explain the nature of those war powers of the government " which lie dormant during time of peace , " and therefore he frankly put the question , " Is Congress the government ? " Senator Fessenden , echoing Stevens had said , " There is no limit on the powers of Congress ; everything must yield to the force of martial law as resolved by Congress . " " There , sir , " said Browning , " is as broad and deep a foundation for absolute despotism as was ever laid . " He rang the changes on the need to " protect minorities from the oppression and tyranny of excited majorities . " He went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the presidential theory as opposed to the congressional theory , by formulating two propositions which reappear in some of Lincoln 's most famous papers . Congress is not a safe vessel for extraordinary powers , because in our system we have difficulty in bringing it definitely to an account under any sort of plebiscite . On the other hand the President , if he abuses the war powers " when peace returns , is answerable to the civil power for that abuse . " But Browning was not content to reason on generalities . Asserting that Congress could no more command the army than it could adjudicate a case , he further asserted that the Supreme Court had settled the matter and had lodged the war powers in the President . He cited a decision called forth by the legal question , " Can a Circuit Court of the United States inquire whether a President had acted rightly in calling out the militia of a State to suppress an insurrection ? " " The elevated office of the President , " said the Court , " chosen as he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high responsibility he could not fail to feel when acting in a case of such moment , appear to furnish as strong safeguards against the wilful abuse of power as human prudence and foresight could well devise . At all events , it is conferred upon him by the Constitution and the laws of the United States , and therefore , must be respected and enforced in its judicial tribunals. " ( 9 ) Whether or not constitutional lawyers would agree with Browning in the conclusion he drew from this decision , it was plainly the bed rock of his thought . He believed that the President  --  whatever your mere historian might have to say  --  was in point of fact the exponent of the people as a whole , and therefore the proper vessel for the ultimate rights of a sovereign , rights that only the people possess , that only the people can delegate . And this was Lincoln 's theory . Roughly speaking , he-conceived of the presidential office about as if it were the office of Tribune of the People . There was still another reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory of congressional supremacy . It was , in their minds , not only the general question of all Congresses but immediately of this particular Congress . An assembly in which the temper of Wade and Chandler , of Stevens and Sumner , was entering the ascendent , was an assembly to be feared ; its supremacy was to be denied , its power was to be fought . Browning did not close without a startling passage flung square in the teeth of the apostles of fury . He summed up the opposite temper , Lincoln 's temper , in his description of " Our brethren of the South  --  for I am willing to call them brethren ; my heart yet yearns toward them with a fervency of love which even their treason has not all extinguished , which tempts me constantly to say in their behalf , ' Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do . ' " He pleaded with the Senate not to consider them " as public enemies but as insurgent citizens only , " and advocated an Act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their return to allegiance and submission to the authority of the government . " Had this narrowly constitutional issue arisen in quiet times , who can say how slight might have been its significance ? But Fate had decreed that it should arise in the stormiest moment of our history . Millions of men and women who cared nothing for constitutional theories , who were governed by that passion to see immediate results which the thoughtless ever confuse with achievement , these were becoming hysterical over delay . Why did not the government do something ? Everywhere voices were raised accusing the President of cowardice . The mania of suspicion was not confined to the Committee . The thoughts of a multitude were expressed by Congressman Hickman in his foolish words , " These are days of irresponsibility and imbecility , and we are required to perform two offices  --  the office of legislator and the office of President . " The better part of a year had passed since the day of Sumter , and still the government had no military success to its credit . An impetuous people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual measure to have its wishes speedily gratified , must somehow be marshalled behind the government , unless the alternative was the capture of power by the Congressional Cabal that was forming against the President . Entering upon the dark days of the first half of 1862 , Lincoln had no delusions about the task immediately before him . He must win battles ; otherwise , he saw no way of building up that popular support which alone would enable him to keep the direction of policy in the hands of the Executive , to keep it out of the hands of Congress . In a word , the standing or falling of his power appeared to have been committed to the keeping of the army . What the army would do with it , save his policy or wreck his policy , was to no small degree a question of the character and the abilities of the Commanding General . @# @# XXI . THE STRUGGLE TO CONTROL THE ARMY George Brinton McClellan , when at the age of thirty-four he was raised suddenly to a dizzying height of fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though he was not that , he had a real claim to distinction . Had destiny been considerate , permitting him to rise gradually and to mature as he rose , he might have earned a stable reputation high among those who are not quite great . He had done well at West Point , and as a very young officer in the Mexican War ; he had represented his country as a military observer with the allies in the Crimea ; he was a good engineer , and a capable man of business . His winning personality , until he went wrong in the terrible days of 1862 , inspired " a remarkable affection and regard in every one from the President to the humblest orderly that waited at his door . " ( 1 ) He was at home among books ; he could write to his wife that Prince Napoleon " speaks English very much as the Frenchmen do in the old English comedies " ; ( 2 ) he was able to converse in " French , Spanish , Italian , German , in two Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Men like Wade and Chandler probably thought of him as a " highbrow , " and doubtless he irritated them by invariably addressing the President as " Your Excellency . " He had the impulses as well as the traditions of an elder day . But he had three insidious defects . At the back of his mind there was a vein of theatricality , hitherto unrevealed , that might , under sufficient stimulus , transform him into a poseur . Though physically brave , he had in his heart , unsuspected by himself or others , the dread of responsibility . He was void of humor . These damaging qualities , brought out and exaggerated by too swift a rise to apparent greatness , eventually worked his ruin . As an organizer he was unquestionably efficient . His great achievement which secures him a creditable place in American history was the conversion in the autumn of 1861 of a defeated rabble and a multitude of raw militia into a splendid fighting machine . The very excellence of this achievement was part of his undoing . It was so near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a false estimate of himself , hid from him his own limitation . It imposed also on his enemies . Crude , fierce men like the Vindictive leaders of Congress , seeing this miracle take place so astoundingly soon , leaped at once to the conclusion that he could , if he would , follow it by another miracle . Having forged the thunderbolt , why could he not , if he chose , instantly smite and destroy ? All these hasty inexperienced zealots labored that winter under the delusion that one great battle might end the war . When McClellan , instead of rushing to the front , entered his second phase  --  the one which he did not understand himself , which his enemies never understood  --  when he entered upon his long course of procrastination , the Jacobins , startled , dumfounded , casting about for reasons , could find in their unanalytical vision , but one . When Jove did not strike , it must be because Jove did not wish to strike . McClellan was delaying for a purpose . Almost instantaneous was the whisper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treachery ! We are betrayed . He is in league with the enemy . " Their distrust was not allayed by the manner in which he conducted himself . His views of life and of the office of commanding general were not those of frontier America . He believed in pomp , in display , in an ordered routine . The fine weather of the autumn of 1861 was utilized at Washington for frequent reviews . The flutter of flags , the glint of marching bayonets , the perfectly ordered rhythm of marching feet , the blare of trumpets , the silvery notes of the bugles , the stormily rolling drums , all these filled with martial splendor the golden autumn air when the woods were falling brown . And everywhere , it seemed , look where one might , a sumptuously uniformed Commanding General , and a numerous and sumptuous staff , were galloping past , mounted on beautiful horses . Plain , blunt men like the Jacobins , caring nothing for this ritual of command , sneered . They exchanged stories of the elaborate dinners he was said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine , the numerous guests ; and after these dinners , he and his gorgeous staff , " clattering up and down the public streets " merely to show themselves off . All this sneering was wildly exaggerated . The mania of exaggeration , the mania of suspicion , saturated the mental air breathed by every politician at Washington , that desperate winter , except the great and lonely President and the cynical Secretary of State . McClellan made no concessions to the temper of the hour . With Lincoln , his relations at first were cordial . Always he was punctiliously respectful to " His Excellency . " It is plain that at first Lincoln liked him and that his liking was worn away slowly . It is equally plain that Lincoln did not know how to deal with him . The tendency to pose was so far from anything in Lincoln 's make-up that it remained for him , whether in McClellan or another , unintelligible . That humility which was so conspicuous in this first period of his rule , led him to assume with his General a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to ring false by failing to appreciate it . He even complained of it in a letter to his wife . The military ritualist would have liked a more Olympian superior . And there is no denying that his head was getting turned . Perhaps he had excuse . The newspapers printed nonsensical editorials praising " the young Napoleon . " His mail was filled with letters urging him to carry things with a high hand ; disregard , if necessary , the pusillanimous civil government , and boldly " save the country . " He had so little humor that he could take this stuff seriously . Among all the foolish letters which the executors of famous men have permitted to see the light of publicity , few outdo a letter of McClellan 's in which he confided to his wife that he was willing to become dictator , should that be the only way out , and then , after saving his country , to perish. ( 3 ) In this lordly mood of the melodramatic , he gradually  --  probably without knowing it  --  became inattentive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consult him , generally on foot , clad in very ordinary clothes . He was known to sit in McClellan 's library " rather unnoticed " awaiting the General 's pleasure. ( 4 ) At last the growing coolness of McClellan went so far that an event occurred which Hay indignantly set down in his diary : " I wish here to record what I consider a portent of evil to come . The President , Governor Seward and I went over to McClellan 's house tonight . The servant at the door said the General was at the wedding of Colonel Wheaton at General Buell 's and would soon return . We went in and after we had waited about an hour , McClellan came in , and without paying particular attention to the porter who told him the President was waiting to see him , went up-stairs , passing the door of the room where the President and the Secretary of State were seated . They waited about half an hour , and sent once more a servant to tell the General they were there ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I merely record this unparalleled insolence of epaulettes without comment It is the first indication I have yet seen of the threatened supremacy of the military authorities . Coming home , I spoke to the President about the matter , but he seemed not to have noticed it specially , saying it were better at this time not to be making points of etiquette and personal dignity . " ( 5 ) Did ever a subordinate , even a general , administer to a superior a more astounding snub ? To Lincoln in his selfless temper , it was Only a detail in his problem of getting the army into action . What room for personal affronts however gross in a mood like his ? To be sure he ceased going to McClellan 's house , and thereafter summoned McClellan to come to him , but no change appeared in the tone of his intercourse with the General . " I will hold McClellan 's horse , " said he , " if he will win me victories . " ( 6 ) All this while , the two were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , though no one saw it at the time-the deep dread of responsibility that was destined to paralyze him as an active general . He was never ready . Always , there must be more preparation , more men , more this , more that . In January , 1862 , Lincoln , grown desperate because of hope deferred , made the first move of a sort that was to be lamentably frequent the next six months . He went over the head of the Commanding General , and , in order to force a result , evoked a power not recognized in the military scheme of things . By this time the popular adulation of McClellan was giving place to a general imitation of the growling of the Jacobins , now well organized in the terrible Committee and growing each day more and more hostile to the Administration . Lincoln had besought McClellan to take into account the seriousness of this rising tide of opposition. ( 7 ) His arguments made no impression . McClellan would not recognize the political side of war . At last , partly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner , Lincoln published to the country a military program . He publicly instructed the Commanding General to put all his forces in movement on all fronts , on Washington 's birthday. ( 8 ) From this moment the debate between the President and the General with regard to plans of campaign approached the nature of a dispute . McClellan repeated his demand for more time in which to prepare . He objected to the course of advance which the President wished him to pursue . Lincoln , seeing the situation first of all as a political problem , grounded his thought upon two ideas neither of which was shared by McClellan : the idea that the supreme consideration was the safety of Washington ; the resultant idea that McClellan should move directly south , keeping his whole army constantly between Washington and the enemy . McClellan wished to treat Washington as but one important detail in his strategy ; he had a grandiose scheme for a wide flanking movement , for taking the bulk of his army by sea to the coast of Virginia , and thus to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the walls of Richmond . Lincoln , neither then nor afterward more than an amateur in strategy , was deeply alarmed by this bold mode of procedure . His political instinct told him that if there was any slip and Washington was taken , even briefly , by the Confederates , the game was up . He was still further alarmed when he found that some of the eider generals held views resembling his own. ( 9 ) To his modest , still groping mind , this was a trying situation . In the President lay the ultimate responsibility for every move the army should make . And whose advice should he accept as authoritative ? The first time he asked himself that question , such peace of mind as had survived the harassing year 1861 left him , not to return for many a day . At this moment of crises , occurred one of his keenest personal afflictions . His little son Willie sickened and died . Lincoln 's relation to his children was very close , very tender . Many anecdotes show this boy frolicking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anecdotes preserve the stupefying grief of his father after the child 's death . Of these latter , the most extreme which portray Lincoln toward the close of February so unnerved as to be incapable of public duty , may be dismissed as apocryphal . But there can be no doubt that his unhappiness was too great for the vain measurement of descriptive words ; that it intensified the nervous mood which had already possessed him ; that anxiety , deepening at times into terrible alarm , became his constant companion . In his dread and sorrow , his dilemma grew daily more intolerable . McClellan had opposed so stoutly the Washington birthday order that Lincoln had permitted him to ignore it . He was still wavering which advice to take , McClellan 's or the elder generals ' . To remove McClellan , to try at this critical moment some other general , did not occur to him as a rational possibility . But somehow he felt he must justify himself to himself for yielding to McClellan ' s views . In his zeal to secure some judgment more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the dangerous road of going over the Commander 's head , of bringing to bear upon him influences not strictly included in the military system . He required McClellan to submit his plan to a council of his general officers . Lincoln attended this council and told the generals " he was not a military man and therefore would be governed by the opinion of a majority . " ( 10 ) The council decided in McClellan 's favor by a vote of eight to four . This was a disappointment to Lincoln . So firm was his addiction to the overland route that he could not rest content with the council 's decision . Stanton urged him to disregard it , sneering that the eight who voted against him were McClellan 's creatures , his " pets . " But Lincoln would not risk going against the majority of the council . " We are civilians , " said he , " we should justly be held responsible for any disaster if we set up our opinions against those of experienced military men in the practical management of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quandary , in which his reason forced him to do one thing while all his sensibilities protested , he extricated himself in a curious way . Throughout the late winter he had been the object of a concerted attack from Stanton and the Committee . The Committee had tacitly annexed Stanton . He conferred with them confidentially . At each important turn of events , he and they always got together in a secret powwow . As early as February twentieth , when Lincoln seemed to be breaking down with grief and anxiety , one of those secret conferences of the high conspirators ended in a determination to employ all their forces , direct and indirect , to bring about McClellan 's retirement . They were all victims of that mania of suspicion which was the order of the day . " A majority of the Committee , " wrote its best member , long afterward when he had come to see things in a different light , " strongly suspected that General McClellan was a traitor . " Wade vented his spleen in furious words about " King McClellan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conference a few days after his son 's death and threatened an appeal from President to Congress if he did not quickly force McClellan to advance. ( 12 ) All this while the Committee was airing another grievance . They clamored to have the twelve divisions of the army of the Potomac grouped into corps . They gave as their motive , military efficiency . And perhaps they thought they meant it . But there was a cat in the bag which they carefully tried to conceal . The generals of divisions formed two distinct groups , the elder ones who did not owe their elevation to McClellan and the younger ones who did . The elder generals , it happened , sympathized generally with the Committee in politics , or at least did not sympathize with McClellan . The younger generals reflected the politics of their patron . And McClellan was a Democrat , a hater of the Vindictives , unsympathetic with Abolition . Therefore , the mania of suspicion being in full flood , the Committee would believe no good of McClellan when he opposed advancing the elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he " wished to test them in the field , " was poohpoohed . Could not any good Jacobin see through that ! Of course , it was but an excuse to hold back the plums until he could drop them into the itching palms of those wicked Democrats , his " pets . " Why should not the good men and true , elder and therefore better soldiers , whose righteousness was so well attested by their political leanings , why should not they have the places of power to which their rank entitled them ? Hitherto , however , Lincoln had held out against the Committee 's demand and bad refused to compel McClellan to reorganize his army against his will . He now observed that in the council which cast the die against the overland route , the division between the two groups of generals , what we may call the Lincoln generals and the McClellan generals , was sharply evident . The next day he issued a general order which organized the army of the Potomac into corps , and promoted to the rank of corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to his own. ( 13 ) Thereafter , any reference of crucial matters to a council of general officers , would mean submitting it , not to a dozen commanders of divisions with McClellan men in the majority , but to four or five commanders of corps none of whom was definitely of the McClellan faction . Thus McClellan was virtually put under surveillance of an informal war council scrutinizing his course from the President 's point of view . It was this reduced council of the subordinates , as will presently appear , that made the crucial decision of the campaign . On the same day Lincoln issued another general order accepting McClellan 's plan for a flanking movement to the Virginia coast. ( 14 ) The Confederate lines at this time ran through Manassas  --  the point Lincoln wished McClellan to strike . It was to be known later that the Confederate General gave to Lincoln 's views the high endorsement of assuming that they were the inevitable views that the Northern Commander , if he knew his business , would act upon . Therefore , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions farther South . By a curious coincidence , his " strategic retreat " occurred immediately after McClellan had been given authority to do what he liked . On the ninth of March it was known at Washington that Manassas had been evacuated . Whereupon , McClellan 's fatal lack of humor permitted him to make a great blunder . The man who had refused to go to Manassas while the Confederates were there , marched an army to Manassas the moment he heard that they were gone  --  and then marched back again . This performance was instantly fixed upon for ridicule as McClellan 's " promenade to Manassas . " To Lincoln the news of the promenade seemed both a vindication of his own plan and crushing evidence that if he had insisted on his plan , the Confederate army would have been annihilated , the war in one cataclysm brought to an end . He was ridden , as most men were , by the delusion of one terrific battle that was to end all . In a bitterness of disappointment , his slowly tortured spirit burst into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they approved of him . The next act of this man , ordinarily so gentle , seems hardly credible . By a stroke of his pen , he stripped McClellan of the office of Commanding General , reduced him to the rank of mere head of a local army , the army of the Potomac ; furthermore , he permitted him to hear of his degradation through the heartless medium of the daily papers. ( 15 ) The functions of Commanding General were added to the duties of the Secretary of War . Stanton , now utterly merciless toward McClellan , instantly took possession of his office and seized his papers , for all the world as if he were pouncing upon the effects of a malefactor . That McClellan was not yet wholly spoiled was shown by the way he received this blow . It was the McClellan of the old days , the gallant gentleman of the year 1860 , not the poseur of 1861 , who wrote at once to Lincoln making no complaint , saying that his services belonged to his country in whatever capacity they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine the next move . McClellan called together the newly made corps commanders and obtained their approval of a variation of his former plan . He now proposed to use Fortress Monroe as a base , and thence conduct an attack upon Richmond . Again , though with a touch of sullenness very rare in Lincoln , the President acquiesced . But he added a condition to McClellan 's plan by issuing positive orders , March thirteenth , that it should not be carried out unless sufficient force was left at Washington to render the city impregnable . During the next few days the Committee must have been quite satisfied with the President . For him , he was savage . The normal Lincoln , the man of immeasurable mercy , had temporarily vanished . McClellan 's blunder had touched the one spring that roused the tiger in Lincoln . By letting slip a chance to terminate the war  --  as it seemed to that deluded Washington of March , 1862  --  McClellan had converted Lincoln from a brooding gentleness to an incarnation of the last judgment . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command , he had shown him " very great kindness . " ( 16 ) Apparently , he had no consciousness that he had been harsh in the mode of McClellan 's abatement , no thought of the fine manliness of McClellan 's reply . During this period of Lincoln 's brief vengefulness , Stanton thought that his time for clearing scores with McClellan had come . He even picked out the man who was to be rushed over other men 's heads to the command of the army of the Potomac . General Hitchcock , an accomplished soldier of the regular army , a grandson of Ethan Allen , who had grown old in honorable service , was summoned to Washington , and was " amazed " by having plumped at him the question , would he consent to succeed McClellan ? Though General Hitchcock was not without faults  --  and there is an episode in his later relations with McClellan which his biographer discreetly omits  --  he was a modest man . He refused to consider Stanton 's offer . But he consented to become the confidential adviser of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Lincoln who impressed on Hitchcock his sense of a great responsibility and of the fact that he " had no military knowledge " and that he must have advice. ( 17 ) Out of this congested sense of helplessness in Lincoln , joined with the new labors of the Secretary of War as executive head of all the armies , grew quickly another of those ill-omened , extra-constitutional war councils , one more wheel within the wheels , that were all doing their part to make the whole machine unworkable ; distributing instead of concentrating power . This new council which came to be known as the Army Board , was made up of the heads of the Bureaus of the War Department with the addition of Hitchcock as " Advising General . " Of the temper of the Army Board , composed as it was entirely of the satellites of Stanton , a confession in Hitchcock 's diary speaks volumes . On the evening of the first day of their new relation , Stanton poured out to him such a quantity of oral evidence of McClellan 's " incompetency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel positively sick . " ( 18 ) By permitting this added source of confusion among his advisers , Lincoln treated himself much as he had already treated McClellan . By going over McClellan 's head to take advice from his subordinates he had put the General on a leash ; now , by setting Hitchcock and the experts in the seat of judgment , he virtually , for a short while , put himself on a leash . Thus had come into tacit but real power three military councils none of which was recognized as such by law  --  the Council of the Subordinates behind McClellan ; the Council of the Experts behind Lincoln ; the Council of the Jacobins , called The Committee , behind them all . The political pressure on Lincoln now changed its tack . Its unfailing zeal to discredit McClellan assumed the form of insisting that he had a secret purpose in waiting to get his army away from Washington , that he was scheming to leave the city open to the Confederates , to " uncover " it , as the soldiers said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his enemies demanded that he detach from his army and assign to the defense of Washington , a division which was supposed to be peculiarly efficient General Blenker had recruited a sort of " foreign legion , " in which were many daring adventurers who had seen service in European armies . Blenker 's was the division demanded . So determined was the pressure that Lincoln yielded . However , his brief anger had blown itself out . To continue vengeful any length of time was for Lincoln impossible . He was again the normal Lincoln , passionless , tender , fearful of doing an injustice , weighed down by the sense of responsibility . He broke the news about Blenker in a personal note to McClellan that was almost apologetic . " I write this to assure you that I did so with great pain , understanding that you would wish it otherwise . If you could know the full pressure of the case , I am confident you would justify it . " ( 19 ) In conversation , he assured McClellan that no other portion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in Lincoln 's mood exasperated Stanton . He called on his pals in the Committee for another of those secret confabulations in which both he and they delighted . Speaking with scorn of Lincoln 's return to magnanimity , he told them that the President had " gone back to his first love , " the traitor McClellan . Probably all those men who wagged their chins in that conference really believed that McClellan was aiming to betray them . One indeed , Julian , long afterward had the largeness of mind to confess his fault and recant . The rest died in their absurd delusion , maniacs of suspicion to the very end . At the time all of them laid their heads together  --  for what purpose ? Was it to catch McClellan in a trap ? Meanwhile , in obedience to Lincoln 's orders of March thirteenth , McClellan drew up a plan for the defense of Washington . As Hitchcock was now in such high feather , McClellan sent his plan to the new favorite of the War Office , for criticism . Hitchcock refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " his opinion , as an old and experienced officer , " Hitchcock replied that McClellan had had ample opportunity to know what was needed , and persisted in his refusal. ( 21 ) McClellan asked no further advice and made his arrangements to suit himself . On April first he took boat at Alexandria for the front . Part of his army had preceded him . The remainder-except the force he had assigned to the defense of Washington-was speedily to follow . With McClellan 's departure still another devotee of suspicion moves to the front of the stage . This was General Wadsworth . Early in March , Stanton had told McClellan that he wanted Wadsworth as commander of the defenses of Washington . McClellan had protested . Wadsworth was not a military man . He was a politician turned soldier who had tried to be senator from New York and failed ; tried to be governor and failed ; and was destined to try again to be governor , and again to fail . Why should such a person be singled out to become responsible for the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointment of Wadsworth was desirable for political reasons . He added that it would be made whether McClellan liked it or not . And made it was. ( 22 ) Furthermore , Wadsworth , who had previously professed friendship for McClellan , promptly joined the ranks of his enemies . Can any one doubt , Stanton being Stanton , mad with distrust of McClellan , that Wadsworth was fully informed of McClellan 's opposition to his advancement ? On the second of April Wadsworth threw a bomb after the vanishing McClellan , then aboard his steamer somewhere between Washington and Fortress Monroe . Wadsworth informed Stanton that McClellan had not carried out the orders of March thirteenth , that the force he had left at Washington was inadequate to its safety , that the capital was " uncovered . " Here was a chance for Stanton to bring to bear on Lincoln both those unofficial councils that were meddling so deeply in the control of the army . He threw this firebrand of a report among his satellites of the Army Board and into the midst of the Committee.2(3) It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensued-the accusations , the recriminations , the innuendoes ! McClellan stoutly insisted that he had obeyed both the spirit and the letter of March thirteenth ; that Washington was amply protected . His enemies shrieked that his statements were based on juggled figures ; that even if the number of soldiers was adequate , the quality and equipment were wretched ; in a word that he lied . It is a shame-less controversy inconceivable were there not many men in whom politics and prejudice far outweighed patriotism . In all this , Hitchcock was Stanton 's trump card . He who had refused to advise McClellan , did not hesitate to denounce him . In response to a request from Stanton , he made a report sustaining Wadsworth . The Committee summoned Wadsworth before it ; he read them his report to Stanton ; reiterated its charges , and treated them to some innuendoes after their own hearts , plainly hinting that McClellan could have crushed the Confederates at Manassas if he had wished to. ( 24 ) A wave of hysteria swept the Committee and the War Office and beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day by mulcting the army of the Potomac of an entire corps , retaining it at Washington . Lincoln met the Board in a long and troubled conference . His anxious desire to do all he could for McClellan was palpable. ( 25 ) But what , under the circumstances , could he do ? Here was this new device for the steadying of his judgment , this Council of Experts , singing the same old tune , assuring him that McClellan was not to be trusted . Although in the reaction from his momentary vengefulness he had undoubtedly swung far back toward recovering confidence in McClellan , did he dare  --  painfully conscious as he was that he " had no military knowledge "  --  did he dare go against the Board , disregard its warning that McClellan 's arrangements made of Washington a dangling plum for Confederate raiders to snatch whenever they pleased . His bewilderment as to what McClellan was really driving at came back upon him in full force . He reached at last the dreary conclusion that there was nothing for it but to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running the machine . Accepting the view that McClellan had not kept faith on the basis of the orders of March thirteenth , Lincoln " after much consideration " set aside his own promise to McClellan and authorized the Secretary of War to detain a full corps. ( 26 ) McClellan never forgave this mutilation of his army and in time fixed upon it as the prime cause of his eventual failure on the Peninsula . It is doubtful whether relations between him and Lincoln were ever again really cordial . In their rather full correspondence during the tense days of April , May and June , the steady deterioration of McClellan 's judgment bore him down into amazing depths of fatuousness . In his own way he was as much appalled by the growth of his responsibility as ever Lincoln had been . He moved with incredible caution. * *Commenting on one of his moments of hesitation , J.S. Johnston wrote to Lee : " No one but McClellan could have hesitated to attack . " 14 O. R. , 416 . His despatches were a continual wailing for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . His ill-usage had made him bitter . And he could not escape the fact that his actual performance did not come up to expectation ; that he was constantly out-generaled . His prevailing temper during these days is shown in a letter to his wife . " I have raised an awful row about McDowell 's corps . The President very coolly telegraphed me yesterday that he thought I ought to break the enemy 's lines at once . I was much tempted to reply that he had better come and do it himself . " A despatch to Stanton , in a moment of disaster , has become notorious : " If I save this army now , I tell you plainly I owe no thanks to you or to any other persons in Washington . You have done your best to sacrifice this army . " ( 27 ) Throughout this preposterous correspondence , Lincoln maintained the even tenor of his usual patient stoicism , " his sad lucidity of soul . " He explained ; he reasoned ; he promised , over and over , assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when complaint became too absurd to be reasoned with , he passed it over in silence . Again , he was the selfless man , his sensibilities lost in the purpose he sought to establish . Once during this period , he acted suddenly , on the spur of the moment , in a swift upflaring of his unconquerable fear for the safety of Washington . Previously , he had consented to push the detained corps , McDowell 's , southward by land to cooperate with McClellan , who adapted his plans to this arrangement . Scarcely had he done so , than Lincoln threw his plans into confusion by ordering McDowell back to Washington. ( 28 ) Jackson , who had begun his famous campaign of menace , was sweeping like a whirlwind down the Shenandoah Valley , and in the eyes of panic-struck Washington appeared to be a reincarnation of Southey 's Napoleon ,  --  " And the great Few-Faw-Fum , would presently come , With a hop , skip and jump " into Pennsylvania Avenue . As Jackson 's object was to bring McDowell back to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen into a trap . But he had much company . Stanton was well-nigh out of his head . Though Jackson 's army was less than fifteen thousand and the Union forces in front of him upward of sixty thousand , Stanton telegraphed to Northern governors imploring them to hasten forward militia because " the enemy in great force are marching on Washington . " ( 29 ) The moment Jackson had accomplished his purpose , having drawn a great army northwestward away from McClellan , most of which should have been marching southeastward to join McClellan , he slipped away , rushed his own army across the whole width of Virginia , and joined Lee in the terrible fighting of the Seven Days before Richmond . In the midst of this furious confusion , the men surrounding Lincoln may be excused for not observing a change in him . They have recorded his appearance of indecision , his solicitude over McClellan , his worn and haggard look . The changing light in those smoldering fires of his deeply sunken eyes escaped their notice . Gradually , through profound unhappiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his last eclipse . No certain record of his inner life during this transition , the most important of his life , has survived . We can judge of it only by the results . The outstanding fact with regard to it is a certain change of attitude , an access of determination , late in June . What desperate wrestling with the angel had taken place in the months of agony since his son 's death , even his private secretaries have not felt able to say . Neither , apparently , did they perceive , until it flashed upon them full-blown , the change that was coming over his resolution . Nor did the Cabinet have any warning that the President was turning a corner , developing a new phase of himself , something sterner , more powerful than anything they had suspected . This was ever his way . His instinctive reticence stood firm until the moment of the new birth . Not only the Cabinet but the country was amazed and startled , when , late in June , the President suddenly left Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was living in virtual retirement. ( 30 ) What passed between the two , those few hours they spent together , that twenty-fourth of June , 1862 , has never been divulged . Did they have any eyes , that day , for the wonderful prospect from the high terrace of the parade ground ; for the river so far below , flooring the valley with silver ; for the mountains pearl and blue ? Did they talk of Stanton , of his waywardness , his furies ? Of the terrible Committee ? Of the way Lincoln had tied his own hands , brought his will to stalemate , through his recognition of the unofficial councils ? Who knows ? Lincoln was back in Washington the next day . Another day , and by a sweeping order he created a new army for the protection of Washington , and placed in command of it , a western general who was credited with a brilliant stroke on the Mississippi. ( 31 ) No one will now defend the military genius of John Pope . But when Lincoln sent for him , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His follies were yet to appear . And it is more than likely that in the development of Lincoln 's character , his appointment has a deep significance . It appears to mark the moment when Lincoln broke out of the cocoon of advisement he had spun unintentionally around his will . In the sorrows of the grim year , new forces had been generated . New spiritual powers were coming to his assistance . At last , relatively , he had found peace . Worn and torn as he was , after his long inward struggle , few bore so calmly as he did the distracting news from the front in the closing days of June and the opening days of July , when Lee was driving his whole strength like a superhuman battering-ram , straight at the heart of the wavering McClellan . A visitor at the White House , in the midst of the terrible strain of the Seven Days , found Lincoln " thin and haggard , but cheerful . . . quite as placid as usual . . . his manner was so kindly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the vanity and self-importance of official position that nothing but good will was inspired by his presence . " ( 32 ) His serenity was all the more remarkable as his relations with Congress and the Committee were fast approaching a crisis . If McClellan failed-and by the showing of his own despatches , there was every reason to expect him to fail , so besotted was he upon the idea that no one could prevail with the force allowed him  --  the Committee who were leaders of the congressional party against the presidential party might be expected promptly to measure strength with the Administration . And McClellan failed . At that moment Chandler , with the consent of the Committee , was making use of its records preparing a Philippic against the government . Lincoln , acting on his own initiative , without asking the Secretary of War to accompany him , went immediately to the front . He passed two days questioning McClellan and his generals. ( 33 ) But there was no council of war . It was a different Lincoln from that other who , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and promised them to abide by their decisions . He returned to Washington without telling them what he meant to do . The next day closed a chapter and opened a chapter in the history of the Federal army . Stanton 's brief and inglorious career as head of the national forces came to an end . He fell back into his rightful position , the President 's executive officer in military affairs . Lincoln telegraphed another Western general , Halleck , ordering him to Washington as General-in-Chief. ( 34 ) He then , for a season , turned his whole attention from the army to politics . Five days after the telegram to Halleck , Chandler in the Senate , loosed his insatiable temper in what ostensibly was a denunciation of McClellan , what in point of fact was a sweeping arraignment of the military efficiency of the government. ( 35 ) @# @# XXII . LINCOLN EMERGES While Lincoln was slowly struggling out of his last eclipse , giving most of his attention to the army , the Congressional Cabal was laboring assiduously to force the issue upon slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision where , for the moment , lay their opportunity . They could not beat the President on any one issue then before the country . No one faction was strong enough to be their stand-by . Only by a combination of issues and a coalition of factions could they build up an anti-Lincoln party , check-mate the Administration , and get control of the government . They were greatly assisted by the fatuousness of the Democrats . That party was in a peculiar situation . Its most positive characters , naturally , had taken sides for or against the government . The powerful Southerners who had been its chief leaders were mainly in the Confederacy . Such Northerners as Douglas and Stanton , and many more , had gone over to the Republicans . Suddenly the control of the party organization had fallen into the hands of second-rate men . As by the stroke of an enchanter 's wand , men of small caliber who , had the old conditions remained , would have lived and died of little consequence saw opening before them the role of leadership . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjective element in politics ! The Democratic party for the duration of the war became the organization of Little Men . Had they possessed any great leaders , could they have refused to play politics and responded to Lincoln 's all-parties policy , history might have been different . But they were not that sort . Neither did they have the courage to go to the other extreme and become a resolute opposition party , wholeheartedly and intelligently against the war . They equivocated , they obstructed , they professed loyalty and they practised-it would be hard to say what ! So short-sighted was their political game that its effect continually was to play into the hands of their most relentless enemies , the grim Jacobins . Though , for a brief time while the enthusiasm after Sumter was still at its height they appeared to go along with the all-parties program , they soon revealed their true course . In the autumn of 1861 , Lincoln still had sufficient hold upon all factions to make it seem likely that his all-parties program would be given a chance . The Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combine in a coalition party with no platform but the support of the war and the restoration of the Union . Here was the test of the organization of the Little Men . The insignificant new managers , intoxicated by the suddenness of their opportunity , rang false . They rejected the all-parties program and insisted on maintaining their separate party formation. ( 1 ) This was a turning point in Lincoln 's career . Though nearly two years were to pass before he admitted his defeat , the all-parties program was doomed from that hour . Throughout the winter , the Democrats in Congress , though steadily ambiguous in their statements of principle , were as steadily hostile to Lincoln . If they had any settled policy , it was no more than an attempt to hold the balance of power among the warring factions of the Republicans . By springtime the game they were playing was obvious ; also its results . They had prevented the President from building up a strong Administration group wherewith he might have counterbalanced the Jacobins . Thus they had released the Jacobins from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing their own devices . The spring of 1862 saw a general realignment of factions . It was then that the Congressional Cabal won its first significant triumph . Hitherto , all the Republican platforms had been programs of denial . A brilliant new member of the Senate , john Sherman , bluntly told his colleagues that the Republican party had always stood on the defensive . That was its weakness . " I do not know any measure on which it has taken an aggressive position . " ( 2 ) The clue to the psychology of the moment was in the raging demand of the masses for a program of assertion , for aggressive measures . The President was trying to meet this demand with his all-parties program , with his policy of nationalism , exclusive of everything else . And recently he had added that other assertion , his insistence that the executive in certain respects was independent of the legislative . Of his three assertions , one , the all-parties program , was already on the way to defeat Another , nationalism , as the President interpreted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his argument for himself as tribune , was just what your crafty politician might twist , pervert , load with false meanings to his heart 's content . Men less astute than Chandler and Wade could not have failed to see where fortune pointed . Their opportunity lay in a combination of the two issues . Abolition and the resistance to executive " usurpation . " Their problem was to create an anti-Lincoln party that should also be a war party . Their coalition of aggressive forces must accept the Abolitionists as its backbone , but it must also include all violent elements of whatever persuasion , and especially all those that could be wrought into fury on the theme of the President as a despot . Above all , their coalition must absorb and then express the furious temper so dear to their own hearts which they fondly believed-mistakenly , they were destined to discover-was the temper of the country . It can not be said that this was the Republican program . The President 's program , fully as positive as that of the Cabal , had as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to show , a better right . But the power of the Cabal was very great , and the following it was able to command in the country reached almost the proportions of the terrible . A factional name is needed . For the Jacobins , their allies in Congress , their followers in the country , from the time they acquired a positive program , an accurate label is the Vindictives . During the remainder of the session , Congress may be thought of as having  --  what Congress seldom has  --  three definite groups , Right , Left and Center . The Right was the Vindictives ; the Left , the irreconcilable Democrats ; the Center was composed chiefly of liberal Republicans but included a few Democrats , those who rebelled against the political chicanery of the Little Men . The policy of the Vindictives was to force upon the Administration the double issue of emancipation and the supremacy of Congress . Therefore , their aim was to pass a bill freeing the slaves on the sole authority of a congressional act . Many resolutions , many bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some were buried in committees ; some were remade in committees and subjected to long debate by the Houses ; now and then one was passed upon . But the spring wore through and the summer came , and still the Vindictives were not certainly in control of Congress . No bill to free slaves by congressional action secured a majority vote . At the same time it was plain that the strength of the Vindictives was slowly , steadily , growing . Outside Congress , the Abolitionists took new hope . They had organized a systematic propaganda . At Washington , weekly meetings were held in the Smithsonian Institute , where all their most conspicuous leaders , Phillips , Emerson , Brownson , Garret Smith , made addresses . Every Sunday a service was held in the chamber of the House of Representatives and the sermon was almost always a " terrific arrangement of slavery . " Their watch-word was " A Free Union or Disintegration . " The treatment of fugitive slaves by commanders in the field produced a clamor . Lincoln insisted on strict obedience to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confiscation Act . Abolitionists sneered at " all this gabble about the sacredness of the Constitution . " ( 3 ) But Lincoln was not to be moved . When General Hunter , taking a leaf from the book of Fremont , tried to force his hand , he did not hesitate . Hunter had issued a proclamation by which the slaves in the region where he commanded were " declared forever free . " This was in May when Lincoln 's difficulties with McClellan were at their height ; when the Committee was zealously watching to catch him in any sort of mistake ; when the House was within four votes of a majority for emancipation by act of Congress ; ( 4 ) when there was no certainty whether the country was with him or with the Vindictives . Perhaps that new courage which definitely revealed itself the next month , may be first glimpsed in the proclamation overruling Hunter : " I further make known that whether it be competent for me , as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy , to declare the slaves of any State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any case , it shall have become a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the government to exercise such supposed power , are questions which , under my responsibility , I reserve to myself , and which I can not feel justified in leaving to the decision of commanders in the field . " ( 5 ) The revocation of Hunter 's order infuriated the Abolitionists . It deeply disappointed the growing number who , careless about slavery , wanted emancipation as a war measure , as a blow at the South . Few of either of these groups noticed the implied hint that emancipation might come by executive action . Here was the matter of the war powers in a surprising form . However , it was not unknown to Congress . Attempts had been made to induce Congress to concede the war powers to the President and to ask , not command , him to use them for the liberation of slaves in the Seceded States . Long before , in a strangely different connection , such vehement Abolitionists as Giddings and J. Q. Adams had pictured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What induced Lincoln to throw out this hint of a possible surrender on the subject of emancipation ? Again , as so often , the silence as to his motives is unbroken . However , there can be no doubt that his thinking on the subject passed through several successive stages . But all his thinking was ruled by one idea . Any policy he might accept , or any refusal of policy , would be judged in his own mind by the degree to which it helped , or hindered , the national cause . Nothing was more absurd than the sneer of the Abolitionists that he was " tender " of slavery . Browning spoke for him faithfully , " If slavery can survive the shock of war and secession , be it so . If in the conflict for liberty , the Constitution and the Union , it must necessarily perish , then let it perish . " Browning refused to predict which alternative would develop . His point was that slaves must be treated like other property . But , if need be , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the Union . He had no intention to " protect " slavery. ( 6 ) In the first stage of Lincoln 's thinking on this thorny subject , his chief anxiety was to avoid scaring off from the national cause those Southern Unionists who were not prepared to abandon slavery . This was the motive behind his prompt suppression of Fremont . It was this that inspired the Abolitionist sneer about his relative attitude toward God and Kentucky . As a compromise , to cut the ground from under the Vindictives , he had urged the loyal Slave States to endorse a program of compensated emancipation . But these States were as unable to see the handwriting on the wall as were the Little Men . In the same proclamation that overruled Hunter , while hinting at what the Administration might feel driven to do , Lincoln appealed again to the loyal Slave States to accept compensated emancipation . " I do not argue , " said he , " I beseech you to make the argument for yourselves . You can not , if you would , be blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This proposal makes common cause for a common object , casting no reproaches upon any . It acts not the Pharisee . The change it contemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven , not rending or wrecking anything . " ( 7 ) Though Lincoln , at this moment , was anxiously watching the movement in Congress to force his hand , he was not apparently cast down . He was emerging from his eclipse . June was approaching and with it the final dawn . Furthermore , when he issued this proclamation on May nineteenth , he had not lost faith in McClellan . He was still hoping for news of a crushing victory ; of McClellan 's triumphal entry into Richmond . The next two months embraced both those transformations which together revolutionized his position . He emerged from his last eclipse ; and McClellan failed him . When Lincoln returned to Washington after his two days at the front , he knew that the fortunes of his Administration were at a low ebb . Never had he been derided in Congress with more brazen injustice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would now unmask their guns-as Chandler did , seven days later . The line of Vindictive criticism could easily be foreshadowed : the government had failed ; it was responsible for a colossal military catastrophe ; but what could you expect of an Administration that would not strike its enemies through emancipation ; what a shattering demonstration that the Executive was not a safe repository of the war powers . Was there any way to forestall or disarm the Vindictives ? His silence gives us no clue when or how the answer occurred to him  --  by separating the two issues ; by carrying out the hint in the May proclamation ; by yielding on emancipation while , in the very act , pushing the war powers of the President to their limit , declaring slaves free by an executive order . The importance of preserving the war power of the President had become a fixed condition of Lincoln 's thought . Already , he was looking forward not only to victory but to the great task that should come after victory . He was determined , if it were humanly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President , and out of the hands of Congress . A first step had already been taken . In portions of occupied territory , military governors had been appointed . Simple as this seemed to the careless observer , it focussed the whole issue . The powerful , legal mind of Sumner at once perceived its significance . He denied in the Senate the right of the President to make such appointments ; he besought the Senate to demand the cancellation of such appointment . He reasserted the absolute sovereignty of Congress. ( 8 ) It would be a far-reaching stroke if Lincoln , in any way , could extort from Congress acquiescence in his use of the war powers on a vast scale . Freeing the slaves by executive order would be such a use . Another train of thought also pointed to the same result . Lincoln 's desire to further the cause of " the Liberal party throughout the world , " that desire which dated back to his early life as a politician , had suffered a disappointment . European Liberals , whose political vision was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . The Confederate authorities had been quick to publish in Europe his official pronouncements that the war had been undertaken not to abolish slavery but to preserve the Union . As far back as September , 1861 , Carl Schurz wrote from Spain to Seward that the Liberals abroad were disappointed , that " the impression gained ground that the war as waged by the Federal government , far from being a war of principle , was merely a war of policy , " and " that from this point of view much might be said for the South . " ( 9 ) In fact , these hasty Europeans had found a definite ground for complaining that the American war was a reactionary influence . The concentration of American cruisers in the Southern blockade gave the African slave trade its last lease of life . With no American war-ship among the West Indies , the American flag became the safeguard of the slaver . Englishmen complained that " the swift ships crammed with their human cargoes " had only to " hoist the Stars and Stripes and pass under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though Seward scored a point by his treaty giving British cruisers the right to search any ships carrying the American flag , the distrust of the foreign Liberals was not removed . They inclined to stand aside and to allow the commercial classes of France and England to dictate policy toward the United States . The blockade , by shutting off the European supply of raw cotton , on both sides the channel , was the cause of measureless unemployment , of intolerable misery . There was talk in both countries of intervention . Napoleon , especially , loomed large on the horizon as a possible ally of the Confederacy . And yet , all this while , Lincoln had it in his power at any minute to lay the specter of foreign intervention . A pledge to the " Liberal party throughout the world " that the war would bring about the destruction of slavery , and great political powers both in England and in France would at once cross the paths of their governments should they move toward intervention . Weighty as were all these reasons for a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war powers , committing the Abolitionists to the Administration , winning over the European Liberals  --  there was a fourth reason which , very probably , weighed upon Lincoln most powerfully of them all . Profound gloom had settled upon the country . There was no enthusiasm for military service . And Stanton , who lacked entirely the psychologic vision of the statesman , had recently committed an astounding blunder . After a few months in power he had concluded that the government had enough soldiers and had closed the recruiting offices. ( 11 ) Why Lincoln permitted this singular proceeding has never been satisfactorily explained. * Now he was reaping the fruits . A defeated army , a hopeless country , and no prospect of swift reinforcement ! If a shift of ground on the question of emancipation would arouse new enthusiasm , bring in a new stream of recruits , Lincoln was prepared to shift . *Stanton 's motive was probably economy . Congress was terrified by the expense of the war . The Committee was deeply alarmed over the political effect of war taxation . They and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crush the Confederacy . But even in this dire extremity , he would not give way without a last attempt to save his earlier policy . On July twelfth , he called together the Senators and Representatives of the Border States . He read to them a written argument in favor of compensated emancipation , the Federal government to assist the States in providing funds for the purpose . " Let the States that are in rebellion , " said he , " see definitely and certainly that in no event will the States you represent ever join their proposed Confederacy , and they can not much longer maintain the contest . But you can not divest them of their hope to ultimately have you with them so long as you show a determination to perpetuate the institution within your own States . . . . If the war continues long , as it must if the object be not sooner attained , the institution in your States will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasion  --  by the mere incidents of war . . . . Our common country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldest action to bring it speedy relief . Once relieved its form of government is saved to the world , its beloved history and cherished memories are vindicated , and its happy future fully assured and rendered inconceivably grand . " ( 12 ) He made no impression . They would commit themselves to nothing . Lincoln abandoned his earlier policy . Of what happened next , he said later , " It had got to be . . . . Things had gone on from bad to worse until I felt that we had reached the end of our rope on the plan of operations we had been pursuing ; that we had about played our last card and must change our tactics or lose the game . I now determined upon the adoption of the emancipation policy . . . " ( 13 ) The next day he confided his decision and his reasons to Seward and Welles . Though " this was a new departure for the President , " both these Ministers agreed with him that the change of policy had become inevitable. ( 14 ) Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bold in thought . He would not disclose his change of policy while Congress was in session . Should he do so , there was no telling what attempt the Cabal would make to pervert his intention , to twist his course into the semblance of an acceptance of the congressional theory . He laid the matter aside until Congress should be temporarily out of the way , until the long recess between July and December should have begun . In this closing moment of the second session of the Thirty-Seventh Congress , which is also the opening moment of the great period of Lincoln , the feeling against him in Congress was extravagantly bitter . It caught at anything with which to make a point . A disregard of technicalities of procedure was magnified into a serious breach of constitutional privilege . Reviving the question of compensated emancipation , Lincoln had sent a special message to both Houses , submitting the text of a compensation bill which he urged them to consider . His enemies raised an uproar . The President had no right to introduce a bill into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put Congress under his thumb. ( 15 ) In the last week of the session , Lincoln 's new boldness brought the old relation between himself and Congress to a dramatic close . The Second Confiscation Bill had long been under discussion . Lincoln believed that some of its provisions were inconsistent with the spirit at least of our fundamental law . Though its passage was certain , he prepared a veto message . He then permitted the congressional leaders to know what he intended to do when the bill should reach him . Gall and wormwood are weak terms for the bitterness that may be tasted in the speeches of the Vindictives . When , in order to save the bill , a resolution was appended purging it of the interpretation which Lincoln condemned , Trumbull passionately declared that Congress was being " coerced " by the President . " No one at a distance , " is the deliberate conclusion of Julian who was present , " could have formed any adequate conception of the hostility of the Republican members toward Lincoln at the final adjournment , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress had been held in Washington . Mr. Wade said the country was going to hell , and that the scenes witnessed in the French Revolution were nothing in comparison with what we should see here . " ( 16 ) Lincoln endured the rage of Congress in unwavering serenity . On the last day of the session , Congress surrendered and sent to him both the Confiscation Act and the explanatory resolution . Thereupon , he indulged in what must have seemed to those fierce hysterical enemies of his a wanton stroke of irony . He sent them along with his approval of the bill the text of the veto message he would have sent had they refused to do what he wanted. ( 17 ) There could be no concealing the fact that the President had matched his will against the will of Congress , and that the President had had his way . Out of this strange period of intolerable confusion , a gigantic figure had at last emerged . The outer and the inner Lincoln had fused . He was now a coherent personality , masterful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion of self-reliance , having a policy of his own devising , his colors nailed upon the masthead. @# @# XXIII . THE MYSTICAL STATESMAN Lincoln 's final emergence was a deeper thing than merely the consolidation of a character , the transformation of a dreamer into a man of action . The fusion of the outer and the inner person was the result of a profound interior change . Those elements of mysticism which were in him from the first , which had gleamed darkly through such deep overshadowing , were at last established in their permanent form . The political tension had been matched by a spiritual tension with personal sorrow as the connecting link . In a word , he had found his religion . Lincoln 's instinctive reticence was especially guarded , as any one might expect , in the matter of his belief . Consequently , the precise nature of it has been much discussed . As we have seen , the earliest current report charged him with deism . The devoted Herndon , himself an agnostic , eagerly claims his hero as a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devised in rebuttal . The fault on both sides is in the attempt to base an impression on detached remarks and in the further error of treating all these fragments as of one time , or more truly , as of no time , as if his soul were a philosopher of the absolute , speaking oracularly out of a void . It is like the vicious reasoning that tortures systems of theology out of disconnected texts . Lincoln 's religious life reveals the same general divisions that are to be found in his active life : from the beginning to about the time of his election ; from the close of 1860 to the middle of 1862 ; the remainder . Of his religious experience in the first period , very little is definitely known . What glimpses we have of it both fulfill and contradict the forest religion that was about him in his youth . The superstition , the faith in dreams , the dim sense of another world surrounding this , the belief in communion between the two , these are the parts of him that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , the spiritual passions , the ecstacies , the vague sensing of the terribleness of the creative powers ,  --  to them always he made no response . And the crude philosophizing of the forest theologians , their fiercely simple dualism  --  God and Satan , thunder and lightning , the eternal war in the heavens , the eternal lake of fire  --  it meant nothing to him . Like all the furious things of life , evil appeared to him as mere negation , a mysterious foolishness he could not explain . His aim was to forget it . Goodness and pity were the active elements that roused him to think of the other world ; especially pity . The burden of men 's tears , falling ever in the shadows at the backs of things  --  this was the spiritual horizon from which he could not escape . Out of the circle of that horizon he had to rise by spiritual apprehension in order to be consoled . And there is no reason to doubt that at times , if not invariably , in his early days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all without form . It was a sentiment , a mood ,  --  philosophically bodiless . This indefinite mysticism was the real heart of the forest world , closer than hands or feet , but elusive , incapable of formulation , a presence , not an idea . Before the task of expressing it , the forest mystic stood helpless . Just what it was that he felt impinging upon him from every side he did not know . He was like a sensitive man , neither scientist nor poet , in the midst of a night of stars . The reality of his experience gave him no power either to explain or to state it . There is little reason to suppose that Lincoln 's religious experience previous to 1860 was more than a recurrent visitor in his daily life . He has said as much himself . He told his friend Noah Brooks " he did not remember any precise time when he passed through any special change of purpose , or of heart , but he would say that his own election to office and the crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a process of crystallization ' then going on in his mind . " ( 1 ) It was the terrible sense of need  --  the humility , the fear that he might not be equal to the occasion  --  that searched his soul , that bred in him the craving for a spiritual up-holding which should be constant . And at this crucial moment came the death of his favorite son . " In the lonely grave of the little one lay buried Mr. Lincoln 's fondest hopes , and strong as he was in the matter of self-control , he gave way to an overmastering grief which became at length a serious menace to his hea//
