Two Married Men . In one brilliant burst of writing , Vincent Lawrence has sliced wide for inspection a bitter , all too prevalent tragedy . For no reason at all except that they are five years married and that she loves suddenly another man , a wife tires of her husband . This she must tell him , hating herself therefor , yet powerless before the fact . Tomorrow she will run away . <P> She does not run away . In conclusion , the play lumps badly . For two opening acts of wrangling domestic comedy , in which another family splits over the same man , it amuses only mildly . Yet for this third-act thrust , it stamps itself upon the season as significant . <P> Cast and production are competent . Two relatively unknown players , Minor Watson and Ann Andrews , give promise of important futures in that final act which they play from first to last uninterrupted on the stage . <P> Processional . The Theatre Guild , having this season produced two gross financial ( and artistic ) successes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a wild experiment . The play is an effort in American expressionism by John Howard Lawson , called a " jazz symphony of life " and seems at last a somewhat hazy reference to Joyce 's Ulysses . <P> Justly bewildered observers resented the incoherence of the narrative . Dug from the worried contents as best it can be , it is this : A miner in a West Virginia coal town breaks jail . He bayonets a soldier of the invading companies sent to subdue strike disturbances by martial law . Pursued , he finds momentary safety in a mine shaft and there assaults a little Jewish maiden . He is captured , blinded , hanged . His mother , the girl and her father are clutched by the Ku Klux , rescued by agitators . The murderer returns sightless and amalgamates himself with the girl , about to be a mother , in a jazz wedding ceremony . <P> Throughout the whole rasps the strains of a jazz orchestra . Much of the dialog is written in the jumpy idiom of jazz . The several scenes are mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from the orchestra pit . Even the stage-door alley beside the auditorium is employed for off-stage movements of the noisy mob . <P> The language , the reference to normally unmentioned matters and certain of the incidents are unsparingly explicit . Some of the acting is good , none of it bad . June Walker , amusing actress of many a jingling farce ( Six Cylinder Love , The Nervous Wreck , ) poured out tears for the first time before an audience . She doubled her reputation by the searching sadness of her little animal , the heroine . <P> Clearly , to understand this frenzied fable is impossible . Beyond that , two reactions are discernible in the audience . Most of it is irritated and resentful . The minority is excited , savagely amused and deeply grateful that from this formless experiment the Guild has translated some of the stubborn emotional symbols with which the hidden history of American life tells of truth . <P> Stark Young- ' " Astonishing suggestions of living stuff ; full of strong , wounded , indomitable life . " <P> Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected for producing and the playgoer pardoned for avoiding . "
