Excitedly played by citizens of many lands , last week , was the game of Ring Around Nobile-a question game . Was that Swede really eaten by those two Italians ? Would Dictator Mussolini snub and degrade General Nobile ? What about Titina , the General 's little , yapping fox terrier bitch ? Why was n't she eaten ? Is bitch eating worse than cannibalism ? Russia . Moscow and Leningrad saw redder than usual , last week , as the great Communist newspapers Pravda ( " Truth " ) and Izvestia ( " News ' " ) flayed " these Fascist swine ! " An editorial in Pravda-whose editor is Nikolai Bukharin , closest associate of Dictator Josef Stalin ( see RUSSIA ) - keynoted significantly thus : " Here in Russia we know the true meaning of the word comrade . Among the Fascisti it means every man for himself . " Copied from Pravda and reprinted by hundreds of provincial papers was a ribald , satanic poem by Comrade Vladimir Myakofski , entitled Cross and Champagne . Based on the undisputed facts that General Nobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Pope and carried a supply of champagne in which to toast this event , the poem soars into the very zenith of satiric sacrilege and " Champagne Popery . " * Coldly , factually the Soviet press service Tass presented details on the basis of which cannibalism might be imputed to Captains Filipo Zappi and Alberto Mariano ( respectively Pilot and Navigator of the Nobile dirigible Italia ) , who set off to tramp across the ice to land with the Swedish meteorologist Dr. Finn Malmgren , but were alone when rescued ( TIME , July 23 ) . Tass reported that , on the day before the rescue of Zappi and Mariano , a Soviet plane photographed them from the air , and that a third man or his remains was then visible , prostrate on the ice . Tass told that when Captain Zappi was rescued he said that Dr. Malmgren had been left behind some days previously ( at his own request ) to die . Tass stated that Captain Zappi was wearing , when rescued , Dr. Malmgren 's fur boots and coat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zappi 's comrade , Captain Mariano , seemed sick , weak , and wore no fur boots .
