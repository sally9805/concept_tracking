txt " Conservatism in religion can become a hindrance to spiritual progress , " said the Rev. Dr. Karl Reiland , rector of St. George 's Episcopal Church , in East Sixteenth Street , in his sermon yesterday Warning . " Religion can not , and perhaps should not , change easily , " he said . " The emotions with which religious concepts are registered cut deeper than other impressions and therefore are erased or altered with greater difficulty . Just as the highest buildings have the deeper footings and the greater basic spread , so the higher convictions about life are deeper and wider than other convictions . " One does feel , however , that conservatism in religion can become a hindrance to spiritual progress and that it is just this when It refuses to examine , even if it does not receive , the new modes of thought which attract the minds of men .

Birney , American Resident Methodist Bishop in Shanghai , China , in his sermon yesterday morning in the Madison Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church at Sixtieth Street , " The divinest things you will ever know , " he said , " will come not as a sheer gift from Heaven , but from your daily experience . The human experience of sin gathers us all into one family . A famous painter once depicted the prevailing conception of his day , showing God taking joy in the punishment of the - evil . There is no such God as that ; if there were I would turn my back upon Him . God lovea us when we are bad as well ap when we are good . " There is a lot of cheap theology abroad today to the effect that sin is a sort of rash , that it is n't as serious as we used to think it .
