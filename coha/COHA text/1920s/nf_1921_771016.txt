// and hints of the tragedy of prairie women ; and , at the height of a barbecue , the appalling intrusion of death . I have felt in all its potency the spell which the " short-grass country " cast over Theodore Roosevelt ; and I can not hear the word Dakota without feeling a stirring in my blood . It was Mr. Roosevelt himself who gave me the impulse to write this book , and it was the letters of introduction which he wrote early in 1918 which made it possible for me to secure the friendly interest of the men who knew most about his life on the ranch and the range . " If you want to know what I was like when I had bark on , " he said , " you ought to talk to Bill Sewall and Merrifield and Sylvane Ferris and his brother Joe . " I was writing a book about him for boys at the time , and again and again he said , " I want you to go out to Dakota ! " On one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " a kind of idyl . " " That 's it ! " he exclaimed . " That 's it ! That 's exactly what it was ! " The wish he had expressed , living , became in a sense a command after he was dead . The letters he had given me unsealed the lips of the men who , for thirty-five years , had steadily refused to reveal to " newspaper fellers " the intimate story of the romantic life they had shared with the man who became President of the United States . From Dickinson , North Dakota , came Sylvane Ferris ; from Terry , Montana , came " Joe " Ferris ; from Somers , Montana , came " Bill " Merrifield , and , on their old stamping-ground along the Little Missouri , unfolded , bit by bit , the story of the four years of Roosevelt 's active ranching life . In the deserted bar-room of the old " Metropolitan Hotel " at Medora ( rechristened the " Rough Riders " ) ; on the ruins of the Maltese Cross cabin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyous yarns . Apart from what they had to tell , it was worth traveling two thirds across the Continent to come to know these figures of an heroic age ; and to sit at Sylvane Ferris 's side as he drove his Overland along the trails of the Bad Lands and through the quicksands of the Little Missouri , was in itself not an insignificant adventure . Mrs. Margaret Roberts , at Dickinson , had her own stories to tell ; and in the wilderness forty miles west of Lake McDonald , on the Idaho border , John Reuter , known to Roosevelt as " Dutch Wannigan , " told , as no one else could , of the time he was nearly killed by the Marquis de Mores . A year later it was Schuyler Lebo who guided me in a further search for material , fifty miles south from Medora by buckboard through the wild , fantastic beauty of the Bad Lands . I doubt if there is any one I missed who had anything to tell of Roosevelt . So far as any facts relating to Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cold , " it is a narrative of cold facts which I have attempted to tell in this book . The truth , in this case , is romantic enough and needs no embellishment . I have made every effort to verify my narrative , but , to some extent , I have had to depend , inevitably , on the character of the men and women who gave me my data , as every historical writer must who deals not with documents ( which may , of course , themselves be mendacious ) , but with what is , in a sense , " raw material . " One highly dramatic story , dealing with Roosevelt 's defiance of a certain desperate character , which has at different times during the past twenty-five years been printed in leading newspapers and periodicals , told always by the same writer , I have had to reject because I could find no verification of it , though I think it may well be true . In weaving my material into a connected narrative I have consciously departed from fact in only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all  --  are fictitious . In certain cases , in which the story I had to tell might give needless offense to the actors in it still surviving , or to their children , and in which I was consequently confronted by the alternative of rejecting the story in question or changing the names , I chose the latter course without hesitation . It is quite unessential , for instance , what the real name was of the lady known in this book as " Mrs. Cummins " ; but her story is an important element in the narrative . To those who may recognize themselves under the light veil I have thrown over their portraits , and may feel grieved , I can only say that , inasmuch as they were inhabitants of the Bad Lands when Theodore Roosevelt and the Marquis de Mores shaped their destinies there for good or ill , they became historical figures and must take their chances at the judgment seat of posterity with Nebuchadnezzar and Caesar and St. Augustine and Calamity Jane . The Northwestern newspapers of the middle eighties contain much valuable material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which greatly interested the public , but about Roosevelt himself . The files of the Press of Dickinson , North Dakota , and the Pioneer of Mandan , have proved especially useful , though scarcely more useful than those of the Bismarck Tribune , the Minneapolis Journal , and the Dispatch and Pioneer Press of St. Paul . The cut of Roosevelt 's cattle-brands , printed on the jacket , is reproduced from the Stockgrowers ' Journal of Miles City . I have sought high and low for copies of the Bad Lands Cowboy , published in Medora , but only one copy  --  Joe Ferris 's  --  has come to light . " ' Bad-man ' Finnegan , " it relates among other things , " is serving time in the Bismarck penitentiary for stealing Theodore Roosevelt 's boat . " But that is a part of the story ; and this is only a Preface . Colonel Roosevelt 's own books , notably " Hunting Trips of a Ranchman , " " Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail , " " The Wilderness Hunter , " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my material , giving me minute details of his hunting experiences which I could have secured nowhere else ; and I am indebted to the publishers , Messrs . G. P. Putnam 's Sons , Messrs . Charles Scribner 's Sons , and the Century Company , for permission to use them . I am indebted to the following publishers , likewise , for permission to reprint certain verses as chapter headings : Messrs . Houghton Mifflin Company ( " Riders of the Stars , " by Henry Herbert Knibbs , and " Songs of Men , " edited by Robert Frothingham ) ; the Macmillan Company ( " Cowboy Songs , " edited by Professor John A. Lomax ) ; and Mr. Richard G. Badger ( " Sun and Saddle Leather , " by Badger Clark ) . I am especially indebted to Mr. Roosevelt 's sisters , Mrs. W. S. Cowles and Mrs. Douglas Robinson , and to the Honorable Henry Cabot Lodge for the opportunity to examine the unpublished letters of Colonel Roosevelt in their possession and to reprint excerpts from them . Through the courtesy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of an extraordinary letter written by President Roosevelt to Secretary Hay in 1903 ; through the courtesy of Messrs . Harper and Brothers I have been permitted to make use of material in " Bill Sewall 's story of T. R. , " by William W. Sewall , and in " The Boys ' Life of Theodore Roosevelt . " Partly from books and letters , partly from documents and old newspapers , I have gathered bit by bit the story of Roosevelt 's life as a ranchman ; but my main sources of material have been the men and women ( scattered now literally from Maine to the State of Washington ) who were Roosevelt 's companions and friends . It is difficult to express adequately my gratitude to them for their unfailing helpfulness ; their willingness to let themselves be quizzed , hour after hour , and to answer , in some cases , a very drumfire of importunate letters ; above all for their resistance , to what must at times have been an almost overpowering temptation , to " string the tenderfoot . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had without reserve and without elaboration . There are five men to whom I am peculiarly indebted : to Mr. Sylvanus M. Ferris and Mr. A. W. Merrifield , who were Roosevelt 's ranch-partners at the Maltese Cross Ranch , and to Mr. William W. Sewall , of Island Falls , Maine , who was his foreman at Elkhorn ; to Mr. Lincoln A. Lang , of Philadelphia , who , having the seeing eye , has helped me more than any one else to visualize the men and women who played the prominent parts in the life of Medora ; and to Mr. A. T. Packard , of Chicago , founder and editor of the Bad Lands Cowboy , who told me much of the efforts to bring law and order into Billings County . To Mr. Joseph A. Ferris and Mrs. Ferris ; to Mr. William T. Dantz , of Vineland , New Jersey ; to Mrs. Margaret Roberts and Dr. Victor H. Stickney , both of Dickinson , North Dakota ; to Mr. George Myers , of Townsend , Montana ; to Mr. John Reuter , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to Mr. John Willis , of Glasgow , Montana , Roosevelt 's companion of many hunts , I am indebted to a scarcely less degree . Others who gave me important assistance were Mr. Howard Eaton , of Wolf , Wyoming , and Mr. " Pete " Pellessier of Sheridan , Wyoming ; Mr. James Harmon , Mr. Oren Kendley , Mr. Schuyler Lebo , and Mr. William McCarty , of Medora , North Dakota ; Mr. William G. Lang , of Baker , Montana ; Mr. W. H. Fortier , of Spokane , Washington ; Mr. Edward A. Allen and Mr. George F. Will , of Bismarck , North Dakota ; Mr. J. B. Brubaker , of Terry ; Mr. Laton A. Huffman and Mr. C. W. Butler , of Miles City , Montana ; Dr. Alexander Lambert , of New York City ; Dr. Herman Haupt , of Setauket , New York ; the Reverend Edgar Haupt , of St. Paul , Minnesota ; Mr. Alfred White , of Dickinson ; Mr. Dwight Smith , of Chicago ; Mrs. Granville Stuart , of Grantsdale , Montana ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. C. R. Greer , of Hamilton , Ohio ; Mrs. George Sarchet , of New England , South Dakota ; and especially , my secretary , Miss Gisela Westhoff . I have enjoyed the writing-man 's rarest privilege  --  the assistance of wise and friendly critics , notably Professor Albert Bushnell Hart , of Harvard ; President John Grier Hibben , of Princeton ; and Professor William A. Dunning , of Columbia , who generously consented to serve as a committee of the Roosevelt Memorial Association to examine my manuscript ; and Dr. John A. Lester , of the Hill School , who has read the proof and given me valuable suggestions . To all these friendly helpers my gratitude is deep . My warmest thanks , however , are due Mr. William Boyce Thompson , President of the Roosevelt Memorial Association , whose quick imagination and effective interest made possible the collection of the material under the auspices of the Association .
