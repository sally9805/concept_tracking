The customer inserts the required number of nickels in the proper machine ; out drops his package of " Three Castles " ; out pops a voice from the machine saying , " Thank you-corked tips protect the lips . " It blares from a phonographic attachment . Or if he prefers " Barking Dogs " he hears , " Thank you-good &; mild . " " It 's toasted " follows the delivery of " Lucky Strikes .
