If one is in the air and needs to land , where can one be assured of finding an open field with service facilities ? <P> Last week the U. S. Department of Commerce answered this question by publishing a list of landing fields in the U. S. California leads the list of states with 100 fields . Texas follows with 84 ; then Illinois with 64 . New York State is a bit behind the times with only 30 . <P> Chicago leads the cities with 15 havens , seven of which are municipal . There is no landing field on the island of Manhattan . In fact , there are no municipal ones in New York City-only the privately owned and Army &; Navy fields on Long Island . <P> Two hundred and seven cities have municipal fields completed or under construction . Cassopolis , Mich. ; Rome , Ga. ; Atlantic City and Baltimore are among the cities planning to build municipal fields .
