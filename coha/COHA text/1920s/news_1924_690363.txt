txt THE CIVILIZED JAPANESE . To the editor of The New York Times : Lately our people seem to have been trying to keep awayethe Japanese from our country . But the Japanese were a civilized people before there was any English language or nation . In Japan now every child must go to School , and remain in it under competent teachers , until the age of sixteen . No nation equals that . I lived in Japan as a missionary for twenty years . But in all that time I can not remember a single felony of any kind , while in our own country there is continual robbery and murder . The Japanese know this . but they wish to see the good in America . not the evil . As for religion , the older religions are pass , ing away , and Christianity is filling their places . The greatest living preacher that I know , since Phillips Brooks died , is a Japanese . Re and another splendid man hay : : recently become Bishops . THEODOS/LS S.
