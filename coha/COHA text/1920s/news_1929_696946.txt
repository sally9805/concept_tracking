txt It is not easy to see how solution of the railway consolidation problem has been brought definitely into Might by the Interstate Commerce Commission 's report . Some recommendation of a comprehensive sort the commission was forced to make . Its previous program of grouping , published in 1921 , had gone admittedly into the discard . Independent efforts of the railways , to arrange or effect amalgamation on the scale proposed , had ended in deadlock at the really strategic points . Even in the case of New York-Chicago " trunk line " systems , four or five separate plans had been submitted for the commission 's approval , and they were mutually inconsistent and destructive . Yet the Transportation Act of 1920 expressly directed the commission to prepare a plan " for the consolidation of the railway properties , " to hold hearings on the proposals , and then " to adopt a plan for such consolidation . " After making these definite instructions , however , the law itself had provided that " at any " time thereafter , upon its own motion or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject for such changes or modifications . ? as in its judgment will , promote * ' the public interest . " It is this part of the mandate which the commission has observed in substituting a new amalgamation plan for that of Sept. 28 , 1921 . It may be said in behalf of the newly proposed groupings that they ; Submit a general scheme which , if concurred in by , the railways , would be assured of approval by a majority of the present commission . The railways will certainly not assent at once to the present plan in all its details . For the much-mooted privilege of constructing a proposed " fifth trunk line , " two opposing applications have been filed by the Wabash and by the Delaware &; Hudson . The commission favors the Wabash . A majority vote could therefore be obtained for last July 's petition by the Wabash , with the enlargements which the commission has made in the proposal then submitted . But the report does not say that , if the Wabash trunk-line plan were to turn out impracticable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , frankly admits wide division of opinion within the commission itself . One commissioner who assents to the general scheme expresses his personal belief that there ought to be no less than eleven trunk lines ; another , to whom had been assigned the original drafting of the present plan , believes that four are suffi.cient , and opposes any " fifth trunk line . " Similar divergence of judgment appears in dissenting reports on other groupings . In a supplementary opinion , still another commissioner , who concurs in the general plan , frankly expresses his doubt of the wisdom and legality of its general purport . ? All this was probably inevitable . Xt had certainly been foreshadowed , rot only by the conflicting petitions of the railways , , and by the fact that roads which some railways asked to amalgamate with themselves were already owned by other railways opposed to such proposals , hut by the known alignment of the commissioners in passing on previous applications . The present recommendations are admitted not to be compulsory , and the more or less prevalent idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded with great doubt . It is well known that the late Senator CummiNs , principal author of the act of 1920 , regarded absence of such powers as a weak point in the scheme , but was equally convinced that the courts would not uphold an attempt to make one railway buy control of another railway which it did not want . The groupings proposed on Saturday provide a basis for discussion . They show what combinations could obtain approval . As yet , they accomplish little more . The public hearings which must under the law ensue will at least show which of nineteen separate amalgamations ( exclusive of the two Canadian groups to which minor , American connecting lines are assigned ) have a prospect of general approval and which must be revised in the light of existing circumstances . There are two definitely reassuring facts in the present situation ? first , that progress has been made already in determining what are and what are not practicable groupings ; second , that the idea of forcing the commission 's hand , through getting possession of a coveted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been put at rest .
