The Season 's Leviathan* <P> A Study of the Passion for Things Present and Things to Come <P> The Story . Still waters run deep -a quiet pool contains , unseen by the casual observer , a whole society of strange and opposite creatures , thrown together by chance or nature , fiercely loving and hating . So Eamor , an English country house , where life in general seemed to move as calmly and placidly as a still day in August , proved the focus and battleground for a certain group of di- verse , opposed personalities , related by accidental ties of blood or fate . The secret , incessant clash of these personalities , now and then flaring out into active conflict as abrupt as the glitter of lightning , serves as the theme of this lengthy and intricate first novel . <P> An air like the sultry air before a thunderstorm broods over the book- an air of suppressed , excruciated passion . Not passion in the Titivating Stories sense , there is the passion of the human mind for perfection as well-passion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and incessantly the passion of human revolt against the material bonds that hold humanity to the clay . The ending is inconclusive , as in most such struggles-the material characters get their material desires-the less commonplace agonists are liberated after a fashion , in odd ways that do not seem to bring them much of what we commonly call happiness . <P> The main narrative threads are these : <P> Sir Charles Orisser married three times , begetting ( by the first marriage ) Cosmo , a creature continually at war with the world ; by the second marriage Nicholas , a pleasant but somewhat inhibited , overcivilized , over-self-conscious being . When he died he left his affairs in complete confusion , and his ancestral country house , Eamor , at the mercy of John Mayne , a self-made millionaire . His third wife , Lillian , married John Mayne to save Eamor for herself and Nicholas . Mayne and Lillian , never in much accord , soon separated , the latter remaining at Eamor with Nicholas . The situation was complicated by the sudden reappearance of Cosmo , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the interference of other conflicting characters . <P> To detail the ensuing plot with accuracy would take diagrams , a genealogical chart and reams of paper . But here the plot is not exactly of primary importance - the characters overwhelm it with their energy , their eccentricity and , at times , their excessvie gift for lengthy self-analysis . They are the book . <P> Peculiarly written , in a style somewhat reminiscent at moments of the late eighteenth century and at its occasional worst absurdly recollective of the incomparable Daisy Ashford , The Orissers , for all its minor faults , fairly vibrates throughout with cumbrous but genuine power . <P> The Significance . The Orissers deals with the duality of man 's nature - with the subsconscious conflict , continually active , between what people imagine themselves to be and what they really are . The author is a psychologist and attempts throughout to display the genuine impulses and personalities of his characters with as little rancor or partiality as possible . <P> The Critics . The Spectator : " The book is greatly conceived and does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creates an atmosphere , it almost creates a world . "
