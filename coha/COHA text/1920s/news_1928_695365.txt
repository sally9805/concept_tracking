' ' In his letter to Mr. Young General Harbord said that he had been-asked to .. accept the appointment of Metropolitan Finance Chairman by Daniel E. Pomeroy , Vice Chairman of the Republican National ' Committee , and Charles D. Hines , National Committeeman from New ' York . In amplifying his position , as expressed in the letter to Mr. Young , General Harbord said : " I have long felt that the business 1 man should devote the same degree of active interest to national and governmental affairs as does the citizen of most other countries . Government , after all , is everybody 's business ; the more important the business man , the more important becomes his interest in his Government . The time is fortunately past when business and industry can afford to leave the formulating of national issues to politicians whose main interest is one of appointments for self , friends and supporters . " Accordingly , when this invitation to serve my party was extended to me by the Republican National Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is answerable first off , all to his country and its welfare . I asked my Board of Directors 1 for leave of absence on the basis of public duty and good citizenship , and I am grateful indeed that this request has been unanimously granted . " In his letter to General Harbord notifying him that leave of absence had been granted Mr. Young wrote : " The Radio Corporation must not be in politics . It would be if it permitted any employe to undertake any substantial political work while in its service . ouch work not only diverts time and energy of the employe from the business of the corporation , but is likely to create , especially when the employe is the chief executive of the company , undesirable influences and reactions both within and without the organization . Therefore , I think it highly proper for you to ask for a leave of absence if you are to engage actively in politics . Grants Right to Enter Politics . " Such leave should be freely given by the corporation under such circumstances . In no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the suspicion at least of political taint in the corporation be avoided . To deny the right of an employee to engage temporarily in political activity would not only be an impairment of his individual liberty , but if such a rule were universally adopted by all corporations it would disable a constantly increasing percentage of our people from performing their political duties and so become a menace to the welfare of our country . " General Harbord said that he intended to give personal attention to the campaign to raise funds in Manhattan , but would appoint Chairmen to conduct similar drives in Brooklyn , the Bronx , Queens , Richmond , Westchester County and Long . Island outside New York City . Herbert N. Straus , Treasurer of the Republican State Committee , will cooperate with General Hayden and General Harbord in this drive for funds , and part of the amount collected will be turned back to the State Committee , to meet its budget . In this way contributors will be approached but once .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
