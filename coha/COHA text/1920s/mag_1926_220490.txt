" TIME brings all things " <P> <P> In Deauville a slender woman appeared on the beach in a bathing-suit of green-stitched ostrich plumes , tossed from her shoulders a corresponding peignoir , plunged into the surge . In a moment she emerged , her costume as bold as ever . The feathers , put together with a new waterproofing process , shed water like a duck 's back . <P> " Always remember mamma telling you that the most expensive corsets are the cheapest in the end ... . " <P> Thus women of dead decades admonished their maturing daughters . In due course the daughters , in spite of the inconvenient and often painful constriction of their middle parts by rigid cases , grew up and produced their kind . After marriage and until death they continued to lace . They laced up the front and down the back and along the side ; they armored themselves with elastic and steel and whalebone , long , short , and medium , constructed in a thousand exacerbating shapes . Some of these women still survive . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , only 15% of the U. S. corset buyers , the Bureau of the Census made clear last week , reporting a banner year ( 1925 ) for the corset and brassiere trade . The daughters of the lacing women have trifled with their mothers ' advice ; they purchase only the vaguest and least expensive corsets , girdles , slip-ons . There are 166 corset and brassiere manufacturers in the U.

One walked with a companion ; one saw a bearded man ; one shouted " Beaver , " scoring a point for every beard . Game score , as in Fives , was 21 . The vogue of Beaver passed two years ago , but recently , on Long Island , a similar pastime started-the game of Babbitt . One drives the highroad , keeping a sharp eye out for Babbitts. * When a Babbitt is sighted , one points a finger at him , shouting " Babbitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be scored from a single car . Score is kept as in tennis- fifteen , thirty , forty , game . <P> Elks <P> " Boom " went the drums , the horns brayed , the feet shuffled , the crowd clapped , " Boom , Boom , BOOM . . . . " To the music of many bands , with 100 floats , drill teams , drum corps , 100,000 Elks paraded through the streets of Chicago . Every one of them was smiling . Every one of them had on his badge . They were partaking in the big parade that marked the third day of their 62nd National Convention , held last week . <P> Already they had dedicated their splendid Memorial Temple on Lake View Avenue to the patriotism of the 70,000 Elks who served the U. S. in the War . Tears had gushed from thousands of eyes as the orator of the day , Rush L. Holland , recited his great address : " On this spot now made sacred . . . this imposing dome . . . the poppy fields of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot clay pigeons , watched horses run , started a balloon race for an Elk trophy , elected Charles Grakelow of Philadelphia the new Grand Exalted Ruler .
