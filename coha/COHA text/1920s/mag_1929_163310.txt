Having promised themselves " the largest magazine circulation in the world " by 1934 ( TIME , July 1 ) , publisher-cousins Robert Rutherford McCormick and Joseph Medill Patterson of nickel-weekly Liberty last week moved to make that circulation profitable . They simplified the duties of the general manager who had gotten Liberty 's present circulation , by calling in a man better fitted to supervise the getting of Liberty 's advertising . <P> The general manager thus relieved is Max Annenberg , Number Three Man of the Patterson organization . Jewish-born , raised among the Irish of Chicago 's First Ward , a newsboy early trained by the Chicago Tribune and for several years by Hearst papers , Max Annenberg learned all there was to know about circulation . When he returned to the Tribune in 1907 he said : " You make the newspaper . Ill sell it . " His confidence in himself was shared by the newsdealers , whom he made his friends by every means at his command . Once , when they were crying for newspapers to sell during a Chicago strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed trucks , saw that every newsstand was supplied . In newsdealers ' tiny offices , storerooms , back-alley loafing places , the name Max Annenberg became a great name . They call him " Max , " he calls them by their first names . Once when a newsdealer died and left his business to a son who knew little about circulation , Max Annenberg stepped in , said he would be responsible for the efficiency of the son 's organization . Other magazine publishers who , fearing incompetence had removed their publications from the son , promptly put them back on Max Annenberg 's say-so . The son prospered . <P> After duplicating his Tribune circulation success with the Patterson-McCormick New York Daily News ( largest in the U. S. ) , Circulator Annenberg was put in charge of circulating Liberty when it was founded in 1924 . Later he was given the general managership . That meant supervising the sale of white-space as well as newsstand sales . Manager Annenberg drove into the job . Than Liberty 's advertising sales-methods nothing more high-powered has ever been seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They must be coaxed , can not be driven . Somehow , Liberty 's advertising did not keep pace with its readership . " Trick " layouts , a special testimonial issue , salesman 's " thermometers " in the office and other features of the hard-driving Annenberg technique , did not bring in the business as fast as required . Rapid changes of advertising managers did the magazine no great good among agency men . Dark-haired , resourceful Nelson Revitt Perry , formerly with Curtis publications , has now held down the job for three years . <P> Rather than demote General Manager Annenberg , a new title of Business Manager was created for the man now called in to build up Liberty 's advertising . And the man is an oldtime Liberty counsellor , the best in the business , grey-haired James O'Shaughnessy , longtime Executive Secretary of the American Association of Advertising Agencies ( Four A 's ) , famed as a goodwill-maker as well as for his knowledge of advertising , one of the most universally popular practitioners in a highly temperamental profession . <P> Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
