txt A special correspondent of The Wall Street Journal , returned from Europe , calls attention to an extraordinary fact , dimly-impressed ' upon him at first , but standing out with startling clearness , as he summed up the results of his inquiry into European financial and social conditions . This is that the principal , and even the vital problems of Europe , with our own problems where we are directly affected , . have been caused not so much by the war as by the almost inconceivable bungling after the war . The work of the world 's statesmen , indeed , and still more important the work Of the world 's financiers , is being directed to finding a way out of the muddle which started with . the Treaty of Versailles . If a straightforward peacedreaty had been concluded immediately after the armistice , with:the eliMination as far as possible of controversial matter , practically every European difficulty , with perhaps the exception of that created in Russia , would be almost automatically settling itself . A firm attitude towards Germany then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented the appalling demonstration in fraudulent bankruptcy which Germany has furnished in the past four years . Lloyd George himself threatened the occupation of the Ruhr in 1921 . Had the entire German industrial district immediately east of the Rhine been taken in hand in 1919 as part of a receivership in Germany 's own interest , Mr. Stinnes and his friends would not have made and ' concealed billions out of the world 's sufferings and the total destruction of the German investing class , and honesty would have ' been for Germany the best policy . But the hands of the world were tied by Mr. Wilsod with his foblish League of , Nations sellable , raising a dozen new problems where it settled one , and it is not too much to say that so far it has settled nothing . The military occupation of Germany would , by lige time , have been a thing of the past . The Greek:lurkish war would never have happened and Bolshevist propaganda would have fallen flat . The depreciation of the franc would have been'arrested soon after the pound sterling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international integrity so honorably offered by Great Britain would have been a matter for emulation by Other nations , on the commonest grounds of business advantage and credit . There is no need - to enter into the disastrous way in which the opening ' afforded by the.League , of Nations and the 4,447 as.enseted introduced domestic , pdfities into foralai/91 ' 61ra : lit4044 , tile4Lireateit , fiiisi*Ljaetitationi ? in the United States were suddenly to collapse , would we choose for its reconstruction opportunists like Lloyd George , Wilson and Clemenceau , every one of them Utterly ignorant of finance ? What are the governments of the world but ' financial organizations themselves , and what is the world's'problem today but a financial one , using the word in its broad and basic sense ? Great Britain has come back and the German resistance in the Ruhr is weakening . ' But It is exasperating to think that the problem today is to correct entirely avoidable mistakes . If Germany wants American tourists she can have them , like other things , on terms of common honesty .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
