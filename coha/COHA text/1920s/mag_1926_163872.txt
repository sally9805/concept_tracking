Salutes boomed across the harbor of Arica last week as the U. S. cruiser , Cleveland , slipped in between the Morro fort and the Chilean cruiser , Chacabuco , and landed Major General William Lassiter at the port-city of Tacna-Arica , where he is to succeed General Pershing as Chairman of the Tacna-Arica Plebiscitary Commission ( TIME , Jan. 11 ) . <P> General Pershing and Captain Weyman of the U. S. cruiser , Denver , upon which General Pershing is scheduled to return to the U. S. , boarded the Cleveland and conducted General Lassiter to a luncheon . <P> Later the new Chairman called upon the Chilean and Peruvian delegates between whom he is to preside . The Peruvians toasted him aboard the Peruvian gunboat , Rimac . The Chileans feted him on shore . For the time being felicitations took the place of strife and even halted the work of the Plebiscite Law Committee .
