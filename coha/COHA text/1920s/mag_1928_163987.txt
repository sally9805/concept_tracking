Sturdy old Sir Walter Runciman , 80 , yielded a mite further , last week , to the biblical sin of pride . <P> The times are gone when his boyish posteriors used to be chastened by the laying on of a knotted rope end . That occurred when , as a stripling of 12 , he ran away from home and signed on as cabin boy to a certain savage skipper . Today he controls the great Newcastle shipping firm of Runciman &; Co. , Ltd. , and is proud to sit in the House of Commons . Prouder still is he of the fact that his son , also Walter , also sits in the House . <P> Last week rich , tangy Sir Walter Runciman was like to burst with pride when his daughter-in-law , Mrs. Walter Runciman , was returned to the House of Commons from a bye-election in the Constituency of St. Ives . <P> All three Runcimans are liberal M.P .

Wife Runciman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will always support David Lloyd George so long as he remains a Liberal . " Her reference was , of course , to the possibility that Mr. Lloyd George might lead his Liberals into the Labor fold . <P> Last week Mrs. Runciman , M.P. , was congratulated by her eight fellow female M.P . ' s including famed Lady Astor , upon the fact that she is the only one of them with a husband in the House . Husband Runciman , as everyone knows , was recently President of the Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom ( 1926-27 ) , and is gradually taking over the superintendence of his father 's shipping interests . Father &; father-in-law Sir Walter Runciman , no longer a seaman but an ardent yachtsman , has recently completed an autobiograpical work of much gusto and sap , entitled appropriately Before the Mast-and After . <P> Sir Walter 's grandson , Walter Leslie Runciman , 27 , is no seaman but has married a daughter ( Rosamond ) of famed Cambridge rowing coach R. C. Lehmann . Everyone knows that swart Rosamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
