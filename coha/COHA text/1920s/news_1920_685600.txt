txt WHERE THE LEAGUE FAILS . This Hope of the Whole World Has a Democratic Sponsor . in her letter to THE TIMES Miss Victoria D. Ozier hits the nail smack on the head . Your conduct in attempting to " cram the League of Nations down the throats of the American public " has been most reprehensible . It matters not that the American public , in common with the whole world , hungers for some means of international co-operation by which war may be averted ; nor that philosophers have dreamed and poets have sung of a " Parliament of Man , a Federation of the World . " It makes no difference that leading statesmen of both political parties have agreed that the League , substantially as it has been written and adopted by the majority of the nations , great and small , marks a tremendous advance toward world peace , and is the only means in sight for preventing the insane tragedy of war . The point to be considered is that this League was sponsored and to no small degree molded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . Know you not that the Republican Party is the Lord 's anointed , from whom alone proceed acts of merit and probity and measures for the public weal ? And you have dared to criticise that party , have treated it with levity , and even with ridicule ! And you have done this in good English , which makes it still more sacrilegious on your part ! If your diction were not so unim- , peachable , if it had , for example , more of the " normalcy " of Senator Harding 's utterance , it might not have such dangerous potency in winning the reading public from the true faith . In vulgar parlance , " Have a heart ! " The Republican Party , after eight lean and hungry years , is striving pathetically and desperately to get back into power : It has just held a convention , amid great discomfort , and adopted a platform which is as hard to stand upon as the trick stairway at Coney Island . But they are doing their best . They are trying to get their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrcconcilables on the back and coaxing their statesmen of opposite beliefs to gather at the festal board of harmony . And one by one they are lining up and swallowing their knockout drops . It is a tense and delicate situation . Stand back , I implore you , and give them air ! And for their dauntless standard bearer , Harding , how dare you insinuate that he is not the great original force that shall move mountains , and , if elected , bring about all the much needed legislation which the Republicans have deferred , with the twofold purpose of discrediting the present Administration and of supplying themselves with material for shining achievements in the coming Republican renaissance ? Does not the nation know that where the Old Guard leads Harding is fearless to follow ? Where others have paved the fay 4kncl laid down the issues , Harding stands like adamant , steadfast for expediency . In this solemn hour , when the G. 0 . P. Is writhing and palpitating in its struggle to amalgamate ; when its true statesmen are striving to look pleasant while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank and file . of " first voters " scramble for the elephant 's ' back , with only one conviction  --  that at all hazards and at any I sacrifice they must beat the Democrats and send Woodrow Wilson to oblivion ? in this auspicious and fateful hour for you to stand unimpressed , marring the sarictity of the occasion with sarcasm and levity ; for you to flout the will of the Old Guard and impugn the motives and the patriotism of our noble Senators ; above all , for you to belittle the qualifications and cast reflections on the statesmanship of the most amiable candidate since  --  this is sinful and pernicious beyond utterance ! Words fail me , or I should say much more scathing things . But if , after this verbal slap on the wrist , you still persist . in perfect English , in lauding your " pet " project , the League of Nations , you are not merely " shocking , " you are perfectly horrid ! HORRIFIED HANK , New York , July 30 , 1920.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
