Of especial verve and sparkle are biographies* by " Ephesian " of the two most irrepressible and potent members of the British Cabinet . Though the identity of " Ephesian " is supposed to be a mystery to his U. S. publishers-a mystery not cleared up by U. S. reviewers of the book up to last week-it is becoming well known among London literatti that " Ephesian " is Mr. Bechofer Roberts , a distinguished part-time secretary to the Earl of Birkenhead ; one of the great men whom he has biographed . Since Lord Birkenhead was famed as Mr. " F. E. " Smith before his elevation , and since " Ephesian , " when pronounced , sounds like " ' F. E. ' sian , " it was supposed for a time that the noble Earl had himself penned these two books , which seem the product of a brain almost , if not quite as keen , as his : " the keenest legal brain in England . " <P> Bubbling with a champagne sparkle of mellower , sweeter , vintage is the tale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who went to visit the great , romantic chieftain of Arabians , Ibn Saud , Sultan of Nejd and King of the Hejaz . Before a backdrop colorful with the picturesqueness of desert life strides a stalwart , six-foot Sultan , who scorns and rejects Occidental customs , yet is shrewd enough to entertain visiting British statesmen with their favorite brands of whiskey , mineral water , and even " kippers . " When the Britons are gone , all residual whiskey &; soda &; kippers are abandoned on the desert by Ibn Saud , who , with an oath to Allah , bounds saddleward , up and away . <P> Like bootleg champagne is the synthetic " diary " of a Soviet schoolboy , *** actually written by a Soviet schoolmaster . Though the perverse temptations of adolescence are decadently dwelt upon , the general picture of riotous , exuberant democracy in a Soviet schoolroom glows with the ruddy crudity of triumphant youth . <P> * LORDBIRKENHEAD-Doran ( $4 ) . <P> WINSTON CHURCHILL-McBride ( $5 ) . <P> ++ MAKERS OF MODERN ARABIA-Ameen Rihani- Houghton Mifflin ( $6 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Payson &; Clarke ( $2.50 ) .
