W HEN watching the hind in Richmond Park I thought with admiration of the exquisite perfection of the three most important senses in a wild animal 's life ? vision , hearing , and smell . The dog , with a horizon limited to about a third of a stag 's , is a comparatively dim-eyed creature ; he lives , as we see , mainly in the sense of smell . This is astonishingly acute , but that of the deer is just as perfect with regard to its use or purpose , which is chiefly to inform it of distant or hidden dangers to be escaped only by flight . The dog 's smell is concerned with numberless little matters that are of less account ; these constitute his entertainment and give a perpetual zest to his life . He quarters and examines the ground with his nose , to find it abundantly sprinkled over , so to speak , with the visiting-cards of other creatures : other dogs , some known personally to him , others strangers ; also rabbits , rats , voles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these minute matters . If a rabbit or mouse has crossed his track , he is not excited about it , and bits of carrion hidden in the grass and small local stenches , in which the dog revels , are nothing to him . No doubt there is a vast difference in power in the sense of smell in both these animals and in man ; nevertheless , I do not think so meanly of man 's olfactories as some physiologists appear to do . It is a common idea , and is in the books , that man 's sense of smell is decayed ; some writers have gone so far as to describe it as obsolescent . " Who , we may ask , is man in this connection ? It would be nearer the truth to say that the more civilized man becomes , or the more he secures himself against the forces of nature by improving his conditions , the less important to his welfare does this sense become . The dangers he is warned against by smell in a state of nature have been removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the olfactories has been superseded the inevitable result is their decay . This is in accordance with nature 's economical principle ; she will not continue doing for us what we have undertaken to do for ourselves , and will cheerfully scrap the exquisite apparatus she has been building up for our safety in thousands and millions of years . When I see a lover of flowers and their perfumes pressing a bunch of violets to her face as if to drag ' something out of them with her nose , to stimulate by violence , as it were , by repeated sniffing inhalations , a torpid sense , the sense which she knows is in her , although it may have given no evidence of its existence for some time past , ? when I see this , knowing at the same time that the violets ' " nimble emanations " are filling the whole room , I recognize the fact that the sense of smell is so enfeebled in her as to be of no account at all .  |p497  All that does n't come to much , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its people a mere roomful compared with the population of the globe . What one asks to know is , does the Armenian , the Turk , the Siberian , the Zulu , the Arab , the inhabitant of the roof of the world , press a flower to his nose in order to get the sensation of its fragrance ? When the traveler and naturalist Lumholtz lived with the cannibal and ophiophagous tribes of Queensland he found that they hunted by its scent the serpent , a large species of boa , on which they fed . This serpent travels long distances in quest of prey , and , once on its scent , the natives would follow it , like a pack of beagles , through woods and thicket and marshes , over rocky tracts and all kinds of country , until they came up with it . The scent , they assured him , was strong and easy to follow , but though he went down on all fours and sniffed with all his might , he could detect no scent at all . There is , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this sense in different countries and conditions . The man of the physiologist is the one he knows , who is of his own state in life , who lives in comfortable circumstances in an equable temperature . Again , Humboldt relates that the Peruvian Indians distinguished between the footprints of their own people and those of whites and negroes . There are , besides , the aborigines of America from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego , the Africans , the Polynesians , the Malays , the inhabitants of a thousand oceanic islands , the Asiatics . I suppose that at least a hundred thousand Europeans have written books about China , Hindustan , and all the other countries of that vast continent , but I doubt if there is a chapter in the hundred thousand books dealing with the sense of smell in any Asiatic people compared with ours . ? 2 Having , then , few or no facts to go upon , we are much in the dark about this sense ; we can only suppose , if it is accepted as a principle that its decay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision and the improvements in our artificial condition of life , that the decline has been greater in the town-dwelling and comfortably off classes in England during the last two centuries than in the previous two thousand years . To dogmatize on such a subject would be ridiculous ; we are even more in the dark than I have made it appear . By watching a man and subtly drawing him out we can penetrate through his mask and discover his secret and real mind , but we ca n't get at the real state of his sense of smell . Every one of us knows his own , and many of us know it only " in a way . " So long as a smell is not a warning or disgustful one , even if acrid or sour or pungent , it is agreeable to me . The heavy , greasy smell of sheep , for instance , and of sheepfolds , of cattle and cow-houses and stables , of warehouses filled with goods , and drapers ' , grocers ' , cheesemongers ' , and apothecaries ' shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carpenters ' workshops . Wood smells are indeed almost as grateful as aromatic and fragrant scents . And many other smells ? tanneries , breweries , and all kinds of works , including gas-works . But it is always a pleasing v change from the great manufacturing centers to the country and the dusty smell of rain  |p498  after dry , hot weather ; the smell of rain-wet pine-woods , of burning weeds and peat , and , above all , the smell of the fresh-turned earth ? the smell which , as the agricultural laborer believes , gives him his long , healthy , peaceful life . One of my first sharp unforgetable experiences in England was a novel smell , which I will not say assailed , but rushed hospitably on me to receive me , so to speak , in its soft , flesh-like , welcoming arms an earth-born , thick , warm smell , something like cookery and Russian leather , a happy , pleasant smell the like of which I had never encountered before . I had just landed at Southampton on a bright morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , just as it seemed peopled with the chirruping sounds of innumerable sparrows . What was it ? I consulted my fellow-passengers on the question as we strolled about the town , glad at being on firm land of ter thirty-one days at sea ; but though there were Englishmen in our party , no one could give me any information . They assured me that they did not perceive it , and did n't believe there was any such smell . I set them down as poor noseless creatures , with wisdom at one entrance quite shut out . These voyaging companions soon drifted away , leaving only one of their company , an American , who said he had nothing to do except to see England , and so would stay with me until I had exhausted Southampton . We took long walks about the suburbs and over the neighboring beautiful common , he always sticking to me , and still the strange agreeable smell attended me . Then we hired a trap and a youth to drive and went farther afield ; we were constantly shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were sights and sounds and smells in plenty , all new to me . I was intoxicated with delight at listening to the skylark mounting up in the blue and pouring down his ecstatic music . My companion , whose mind was practical , cared for none of these things , but was curious about agriculture . " What do you call that ? " he shouted , pointing to a field of red clover in flower as we flew past it . " Grass , " said our Briton . " Yes , yes , but what kind of grass ? " " Grass ? what the horses eat . " " I only wish the horses had eaten your head off , " said my companion , and the poor driver looked puzzled and hurt . Even at a distance from the town I received whiffs of my mysterious scent , but it diminished the farther I went . Returning to the town , it would again seem general and powerful , yet I could not find a native of the place to tell me what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and I came to the conclusion that as they lived in it they had ceased to smell it ; that it was the smell of the place , of the country , and I called it the smell of England . Afterward in London , then in Gloucestershire , and later in Scotland , I almost lost sight or scent of the smell of England . Occasional whiffs came to my nostrils , but I imagined I had , like the natives , lived long enough in it to become unaware of it . Then after many months came the day when the mystery was revealed . I was in London , walking thoughtfully up Oxford Street , when on approaching Tottenham Court Road a powerful gust of the now old , familiar smell came on me and brought back a vivid memory of  |p499  my first day in Southampton , when the smell of England was new to me . As I advanced , the gusts became frequent and increased in power until I was at the side of a big building from which issued clouds of steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rumbling noises of machinery . The whole air had become a bath of the thick , sweetish , warm , half-flowery , and half-savory smell . And the building was a brewery , and the smell was the smell of brewing ! Of natural odors the most agreeable are the aromatic and fragrant that emanate from plants . The odors of spices and fruits , all more or less associated in the mind with tastes , are of a distinctly lower or less intellectual or esthetic order . It is related of Wordsworth that he was without the sense of smell , and that on one occasion when he was sitting on a spring day in his flowery garden , the unknown sense suddenly came to him to astonish and delight with the lovely novel sensation . He described it as being like a vision of paradise . A similar vision has been mine at frequent intervals all my life ; I doubt if its loveliness has been less in my case than in that of the poet , to whom it came once as by a miracle . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I walk by a blossoming bean-field or a field of lucerne , it is always like a new and wonderful experience , a delightful surprise . The reason of this effect , I take it , is that odors do not register impressions in our brains that may be reproduced at will , as it is with sights and sounds . Thus odors never wholly lose the effect of novelty . We remember that certain flowers delighted us with their fragrance , but can not recall or recover the sensation ; there is no record , no image . Nevertheless , the bare remembrance of it ? of what it was to us at the moment ? is a joy forever . I think of certain flowering trees ? catalpa , orange , lime , mimosa , acacia , locust , with many others , and cherish a love of them which is almost like the love that some woman has inspired in us with her charm , the quality which has lifted her above other women and endowed her with a beauty above all beauty . Trees differ from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of orange and lime than of the Pride of China , or Tree of Paradise , as it is variously called . I often stand in memory in the shade of its light , loose , feathery foliage , drinking in the divine fragrance of its dim purple.flowers , until I grow sick with longing , and , being so far removed from it , feel that I am indeed an exile and stranger in a strange land . It has always been a subject of wonder to me that so many persons find the loveliest perfumes excessive or oppressive , as when they stand by a flowering syringa-bush or are in a room with fragrant flowers ? lilies , stock , mignonette , and various others . I can never get too much of it , or quite enough to satisfy my smelling hunger . Thus I love to spend entire days roaming about on boggy or marshy heaths , perhaps less for what I see and hear of wild life than for the sake of the odor of golden withy , or sweet-gale , where there are acres of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrubs and rub my hands and face with the crushed leaves and fill my pockets with them , so as to wrap myself up in the delicious aroma . Almost all aromatic plants are agreeable to me ? fennel , horehound , tansy , pennyroyal , and all mints ,  |p500  even the water-mint , which most persons find too powerful . Also bracken when it first unrolls its broad fronds , and I crush it to get the unique smell , which suggests castor-oil and the fishand-cucumber odor of smelts , a strange and fascinating combination . The fragrance of gorse is not of the highest order , yet it holds and enchants me above most flowers , and being itself a sun 's child , like the sunflower , or sun-gazer , as we call it in Spanish , its habit is the exact opposite of that of the " melancholy flowers " which shed their soulful fragrance like tears in the darkness and silence of night . The gorse is most fragrant at noon , when the sun shines brightest and hottest . At such an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing from it , I am always tempted to cast myself down on the grass to lie for an hour drinking in the odor . The effect is to make me languid ; to wish to lie till I sleep and live again in dreams in another world , in a vast open-air cathedral where a great festival of ceremony is perpetually in progress , and acolytes , in scores and hundreds , with beautiful bright faces , in flameyellow and orange surplices , are ever and ever coming toward me , swinging their censers until I am ready to swoon in that heavenly incense . Yet , as I have said , this fragrance is not of the higher order , since in its richness there lurks a suggestion of flavors . Its powerful effect is probably partly due to association with the sight impressions the blossoming plant has imparted to the mind of its splendor . Many of our other wild flowers come nearer to the spiritual quality in fragrance , like those of the Pride of China ; also the evening primrose in some of the most fragrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its native land . We have it in the hedge-rose , violet , bog asphodel , primrose , scented orchis , for example . And I should even include , or I should like to include , the cowslip ; but it is too delicious . If by chance I have a reader who shares my feeling concerning the scent of flowers and would like to experience the full deliciousness of the cowslip , I should advise him to repair at its season to that curious strip of flat country extending from the lower reaches of the Somerset Axe to the River Parratt below Bridgewater . It is all meadow or grassland , drained by innumerable dikes , which divide it into vast fields of an emerald green ; it is on a level with the seal or a little below the level at high tide , protected from it by the old bank made by the Romans in their day . Here you may come upon a field of close-cropped grass abundantly sprinkled over with cowslips and no flower of any other kind . The stems , crowned with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart and four or five inches high , so that lying flat on your back you have them pretty well on a level with your nose . Imagine the sensation on a day of brilliant sunshine , with a light wind blowing wave on wave of the delicious fragrance over you ! ? 3 Before finishing with this part of my subject , I must say a word about a curious phenomenon respecting the flowers which Linnus called " melancholy " ? those which pour out their sweetness most copiously by night , One of the commonest is the honeysuckle , and sometimes when I am out at night walking in a deep lane with untrimmed hedges on each side , I all at  |p501  once come into an air so laden with the rich perfume as to cause it to seem thick or dense ; then after two or three steps farther have passed again into a perfectly scentless air . If I then turn back , to get once more into the fragrant area , I can not find it . Frequently I have walked up and down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lost scent , and have also hunted for the plant in the hedge from which it emanated , and have failed to find either scent or plant . This was a puzzle to me on many a summer night in the south and west of England , where honeysuckle and other fragrant plants are most luxuriant , and I can only suppose that in the still , warm night air the massed flowers pour out their fragrant particles into the deep lane below , and that the fragrance does not disperse , but remains suspended in the air , as if enclosed in a film until the wind created by some heavy-moving body , ? a stray donkey , or belated laborer plodding home , or a night-prowling field naturalist , ? sends the whole mass floating away like a cloud or bubble . The most delightful experience of this kind is when the cloud of fragrance encountered is from no flower , but from the leaf of the sweetbrier . In some districts in southern England it flourishes so greatly in the hedges that one can count on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , warm summer night . It is a fragrance pleasing to every one , yet one would have to go far back in our literature to find its characteristic expression , ? even to a time when possibly the sense of smell was more acute in our race , and flower-fragrance more delightful than they are to us . Shakspere has it : The leaf of eglantine , whom not to slander , Outsweeten 'd not thy breath . How beautifully expressed ! Not to slander the scented leaf ! Yet we know that it is a sweeter , richer fragrance than the love odor of a woman 's breath . This is like the heifer 's breath , which smells of milk and newmown hay , combined with a fragrance most like the delicate scent of red ? lover ; but it is made sweeter than all . ssential oils from leaf and flower by love and passion . However , I prefer my favorite Chaucer : And I that all this pleasant sightie see Thought sodainlie , I felt so sweet an aire Df the eglatine , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . Te with its thoughties froward and contraire 3o overlaid , but it should have bote f it but once did smell that savour sote . Dr , to put it in plain prose : " Is there a man on earth in such despair , so overLoaded with cares and maddened with anxious thoughts , who would not find instant relief and forgetfulness of all his miseries on inhaling this delicious fragrance of the sweetbrier ? " And I would ask , Is it conceivable that any poet of this time ( and I believe that the number of those now living in this country exceeds a hundred ) could have such a thought , or , having it , would dare to put it into words ? If he did , what a ridiculous , extravagant person he would seem , to be sure ! But , as I have already hinted , it is possible that Chaucer , albeit so great intellectually , was nearer to primitive man physically than we are in the acuteness of his senses and childlike  |p502  delight in sights and sounds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this subject , as in taxing my memory for some adequate expression concerning the sweet-brier , I can only recall these lines from Shakspere and Chaucer ? these two who are never coupled . They are not the two greatest in our poetic literature , but to me they are the greatest , and one I worship and the other I love . Alike in their all-embracing view of humanity and power of characterization , they are yet as wide apart as East from West in spirit . One would say offhand that the contrary of this is the truth , that they are alike in spirit , since only in virtue of great sympathy and love for their fellows , with the insight that comes of genius , could they have produced all that crowd of wonderfully true portraits that adorn their galleries . Nevertheless , to me they differ essentially in feeling . It was sympathy and love with insight in one , and pure intellect with simulated sympathy in the other . There ' s Hamlet sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old friend Justice Shallow ; and there ' s Malvolio andRichard II , and passionate Romeo , and the melancholy Jaques , and old crazed King Lear , and many , many more . They are an immense crowd , for they have now come down out of their frames or books ; they are of flesh and blood , and I am walking among them as among old friends and acquaintances . But where is Shakspere all the time ? I find him not despite all the loud , triumphant shouts of those who have discovered him in this or that character and exposed his true inwardness to the world . He hides from , he deludes , he mocks us , until we come to regard him as a mythical being or a demigod . Chaucer revealed himself in every one of his creations , in every line he wrote . If he had a fault as an artist , it is that he is too human ; the sense of kinship , of brotherhood , is , however , more to me than artistry , even of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our literature find one like him in this , a blood-relation to all men , good or bad , from the lowest human refuse to the highest , the kingly and saintly ; he is one of them always , and eats and drinks and laughs and weeps and prays with them . All the others whose works are a joy forever are now dead dead and gone , alas ! We know it when we read them . Even great Shakspere and his fellow-Elizabethans , with all those who came after , the heroic , the fantastic , the metaphysical , with their tantalizing , fascinating conceits ; and succeeding them , the smooth , the elegant , the classical , who reigned a hundred years ; then the revolting romantics in a more than century-long procession down even to the spasmodics , whose Balders , Festuses , and Aurora Leighs our one immortal critic would have described as a relapse into a romantic savagery more offensive to common sense than the fantastic conventions of the seventeenth century ; and finally the Victorian giants who long survived these offensive ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt-front ; Tennyson , now under a cloud , sad and prophetic , like the druids of old , with the beard that rests on his bosom ; and last to follow to the grave , Swinburne , in orange waistcoat and loincloth tattooed all over with beautiful female faces in  |p503  rainbow colors , still valorously piping on his shrill , everlasting pipe . Dead ? dead are they all ! But if you think of Chaucer as dead you are greatly mistaken , and when you read him , you need not reflect mournfully , as you would in the case of another , that he no longer treads this green earth ; that he who was most alive and loved life more than all men , is now lying in the colde grave , alone , withouten any companie . I know it , because I am so often with him , walking in many a crowded thoroughfare , watching the faces of the passers-by with an enduring interest in their individual lives and character . But I appreciate his company and love him best amid all rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight our souls with the sight of the glad , light green of the open oak-leaves and the cold , fresh , wholesome smells of earth and grass and herbage . He alone at such times is capable of expressing what I feel . Reading Wordsworth and Ruskin , nature appears to me as a picture : it has no sound , no smell , no feel . In Chaucer you have it all in its highest expression ; he alone is capable of saying , in some open woodland space , with the fresh smell of earth in his nostrils , that this is more to him than meat or drink or any other thing , and that since the beginning there was never anything so pleasant known to earthly man . ? 4 All this about Chaucer in this inquiry will seem somewhat irrelevant to some readers . I do not think so ; and even now , after all said , I am still reluctant to let go his hand . From the oakwood I go with him to the open fields in search of early daisies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kiss the beloved flower ? the beautiful dead child Margaret , come to life and light again in a changed form . Or seated on a green bank , my hand on his shoulder , converse with him ; and if he falls to talking bawdy or love of it , until he makes me sick , I am a little ashamed of this modern squeamishness , and am able to rejoice in his ranker zest in life , his robust humor . And all this time I am seeking after something hidden . Does he , Chaucer , speak only for himself when he writes thus of daisies and the smale foules with their melodie and the scents of earth and leaves and flowers , or is he expressing feelings which were more common in his day than in ours ? Here , then , for the present , at all events , I will drop the question . It is rather unpleasant , after reveling in paradisaical odors with my ancient friend , who is more alive despite his half a thousand years than any man I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a somewhat disturbing matter . When I first came to England I soon discovered that all scents on the male person , natural or artificial , were distasteful and even abhorrent to men . I had been kindly taken in hand by new-found friends who desired to make an Englishman of me ? a respectable person . They told me to wear a silk hat and frock-coat , tan gloves , and to carry a neatly folded umbrella in my hand . They also instructed me to take in " The Times . " One of my friends , a nice old retired barrister , assured me that a man who had not read his " Times " in the morning was unfit to walk the streets of London . I obeyed them in everything ; but when  |p504  they objected to a little cologne or lavender on my pocket-handkerchief , I revolted . They said I had come from a semibarbarous country and did not know all that this meant ? that an English gentleman with scent about him aroused a strong feeling of hostility in others , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an effeminate and nasty mind . But as I had lived among semibarbarous people and hobnobbed with savages and dangerous whites , I knew I was not effeminate and that the nastiness was not in my mind . Their feeling about scents was an associate one . As boys they all herded in great schools and universities , and when the time came for the restraints to be relaxed , they went out to " see life , " and seeing life with them did not mean mounting a horse and riding forth in quest of adventures ; it simply meant going up to London or any other big town in their neighborhood , where they placed themselves under the guidance of those who knew the ropes and who took them to the haunts of people they had never encountered before ? people who were not respectable , chiefly women who received them with ravishing smiles and open arms . These women have the habit of scenting themselves somewhat excessively , and the scents and the women and their haunts , and the people and life altogether , became associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Respectability and the serious business of life call them back , and they shake themselves free ; but , alas ! not free of the vile associations that all perfumes have for them for the remainder of their lives . It may be that this feeling , a sense of disgust , in the gentlemen of this island country is of modern growth . At all events , we read in books that in the eighteenth century , down even to the early nineteenth , when the gentlemen visitors made their exit from a drawing-room , backing gracefully out and bowing low in the elegant manner of those times , they invariably left the scent of pomander behind them . Two centuries earlier takes us to a time when an Englishman could saturate himself with perfumes as readily as any Venetian lady of that period ; when a gentleman could call on his apothecary to get him an ounce of civet , a large order in those days , just to sweeten his imagination . ? 5 From associations which degrade something which is lovely in itself we will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which exalt , and the use of perfumes in religious symbolism . Let me first , however , refer to the word " spiritual " as used a few pages back in describing the perfume of certain flowers . That it has been used by others in this connection I do not know : it would surprise me to learn that it had not . Nevertheless , I must say something in elucidation of my private meaning . Spiritual , as here used , refers to a scent , or to a quality of a scent , which differs in character from all these flower odors described as sweet , delicious , luscious , rich , lovely , luxuriant , etc. ? the scents , in fact , which in some degree are suggestive of flavors ; differing too , from all fragrant gums and woods , spices and the aromatic smells of leaves ; also from all artificial perfumes and scents distilled from flowers . You may capture and bottle a rare or spiritual perfume , but its  |p505  chief virtue , its highest quality , will vanish in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower . Spiritual , then , in the flower scent means an effect on the mind , one we are already familiar with . We find it in certain human faces , in their expression ; in human voices , too , in some moods , in speech or song ; in certain flowers in their appearance , never , perhaps , in any brilliantly colored flower ; in certain bird sounds , ? it may be in a certain note or phrase of its music , ? also in other non-human things , even in the inorganic world , as in certain aspects of earth and sea and sky in certain rare atmospheric conditions . Finally , it is a more ethereal scent than those of other flowers ; therefore more evanescent , yet more penetrating , touching the mind , as we imagine , to something more than a mere esthetic satisfaction . We know how great a part association has in the pleasure we receive from lovely things ? sights , sounds , and scents ; it may indeed be the chief cause of the effect produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I do n't think so . Anyhow , it is doubtful . Thus I may at any time find that peculiar effect in a wild flower never previously met with , growing in some desert place . With frankincense it is a different story . It is one of the thick or heavy perfumes of the fragrant gums which do not suggest flavors , but are also far removed in character from the etherealized quintessential flower scents described as spiritual . The effect , therefore , in religious ritual is mainly due to association , and it is a very powerful effect , and no doubt it was much more potent in the ages of faith than now , and that it was this use of frankincense which gave rise to that common belief in lovely and heavenly perfumes emanating from the longburied bones and corpses of dead saints on their exhumation . Intellectually , we know , smell does not rank as highly as the other two senses , but it is , on the other hand , more emotional and stirs the mind more deeply than seeing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher and lower nature , and only in the lower does it come near to taste , and taste even in the Protestant , full of dry light as he is , he yet admits into his religious symbolism . But he can not attend a Roman Catholic church or cathedral service in the reverent spirit of one who looks on all churches as God 's house without feeling its effect , and recognizing its peculiar fitness despite the want of association for him in that cloud of incense ; and he may even think that he has been wrongfully deprived of something desirable and of value in his own church service when he remembers his Bible , which is perhaps his fetish , and the words of the Being he worships , when he proclaimed through the mouth of his prophets that from the rising of the sun to its going down incense would ascend to him , morning and evening , in all places . Why , then , is incense not used in the Anglican Church , which took its ritual from the church before it ? Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall into disuse in the reign of Edward VI . There I will leave the subject , which , I confess , is rather an out-of-the-way one to bring into a series of papers concerning the senses of man and animals by a field naturalist .  |p506
