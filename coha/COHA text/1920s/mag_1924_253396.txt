The President telegraphed to Friend W. Richardson , Governor of California : " Have noticed with deep concern the report of the growing destruction of forest fires in your State . I trust you will advise me if effective aid can properly be extended by the Federal Government . " <P> A series of fires , following drought , had sprung up in California , Washington and Idaho . A good rain in the latter two States helped the firefighters materially . Severe fires still continued in several parts of California . <P> Mr. Coolidge accompanied his father , Col. John Coolidge , to the Walter Reed Hospital in order that the latter might undergo a thorough medical examination after having spent years on his farm without close medical attention . While waiting the President decided that he would have himself examined likewise . The doctors were unable to discover important flaws in the health of either .
