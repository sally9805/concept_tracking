But he 's beginning to do it the last few years . He never even used to swear until you girls grew up  --  and then , he sort of learned it from you , I guess . WILLY SANDS I bet he had to . You keep a couple of girls in the house swearing blue rings around you from morning to night and it corrupts any man 's morals . I 'm getting so I swear myself . FLORRIE SANDS Well , I must say Bobby never did it much . She was the sweet little thing  --  MRS . HALEVY She 's been making up for it since you left .

FLORRIE SANDS Sitting above table centerAre you quite sure Bobby was coming home , mother ? MRS . HALEVY Oh , she 'd have telephoned .

You are n't so very funny . WILLY SANDS Yes 'm . FLORRIE SANDS Did she turn Fred down , really ? I mean , was it final ? MRS . HALEVY Oh yes ; but you could n't blame her for that  --  he was  --  well , he was over thirty  --  and bald  --  FLORRIE SANDS I know . He was n't a very romantic figure . Neither is old Helmcke , but he has got a lot of money . Is he ever here any more ? MRS . HALEVY Yes , he 's here , but he 's deaf , and after all he 's a widower .

HALEVY There 's the O'Neil boy ;  --  but he 's going to South America  --  FLORRIE SANDS South America  --  ! What for ? MRS . HALEVY I do n't know . Just some trip he got a chance to take . You know I did think it was getting serious , but he has n't been here for a week or more and he 's going day after to-morrow . p. 11 FLORRIE SANDS Does Bobby mind ? MRS . HALEVY I think she does , but her father does n't  --  and she wo n't say a word . FLORRIE SANDS What a nuisance ! To have him go away ! MRS . HALEVY He is a nice boy . FLORRIE SANDS Does he make any money to speak of ? MRS . HALEVY She told me he gets just as much as she does . FLORRIE SANDS Oh well , they could n't live on his $40 a week . I wonder if Bobby sees him at the office . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so busy about this trip  --  FLORRIE SANDS Well , I suppose that ends that  --  WILLY SANDS From the paperYep , looks like the boy 's got away . The telephone rings . FLORRIE SANDS Never mind , mother . I 'll get it . At the phone . Yes ? Yes ? Rims ? Oh , this is her sister . She has n't come home yet . Oh , Mr. O'Neil ? Oh , yes . Just a moment . It 's Rims O'Neil asking for Bobby . MRS . HALEVY Tell him she 'll surely be home . p. 12 FLORRIE SANDS MusingI think I 'd better make it interesting for him . Was Bobby going out tonight ? MRS . HALEVY Oh , no ! FLORRIE SANDS Hello . Why , Mr. O'Neil , she is going out tonight , but she 'll have to be in shortly to dress , you know , and if you 're nearby  --  yes  --  yes It must be a party or a dance because she could n't get to the theatre now . Oh , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wo n't have much time . Well , that is a shame . Oh , you are ? Oh , I see . I 'm sure she did n't know yes , I would tell her , of course yes goodbye . She hangs up . A radio starts in the next room . WILLY SANDS Thin ice , my darling . FLORRIE SANDS Yes ? WILLY SANDS What if they 'd really had an engagement ? FLORRIE SANDS As if I did n't find that out first ! What an opinion he has of his secretary 's brain ! Here she thinks three answers ahead of him for years and years and that 's all the good it does . WILLY SANDS Well , Jiminetti ! You could tell the kid the truth , could n't you ? FLORRIE SANDS Why , Willy , you would n't want me to tell the truth to a perfect stranger ? Think how it would sound . p. 13 MRS . HALEVY It would have been better , Florrie  --  It would have been better . FLORRIE SANDS Now , Mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last throw  --  Winner take all . WILLY SANDS What a dame !

FLORRIE SANDS Moving towards right center , jazzilyDo n't it just ? It 's vain of its face , It 's vain of its figger , It 's just fat enoughBut it must n't get  --  larger . WILLY SANDS Rhyme it you dancing fool , rhyme it ! FLORRIE SANDS Um  --  It never uses bad words . The radio wails . Poor Dad  --  he 's got Chinatown on that two-syllable set of his . Run in and help him , Willy . WILLY SANDS I like it here , thanks . FLORRIE SANDS But supposing I wanted to talk to mother and you were in the way ? p. 14 WILLY SANDS Impossible .

FLORRIE SANDS I do n't know . Yes , sometimes I think I do . But not often .  --  Mother , what do you really think about this Rims boy and Bobby ? Is it kind of serious ? MRS . HALEVY I do n't know how it is with him  --  but Bobby 's been crying her eyes out . FLORRIE SANDS You do n't mean you 've actually seen Bobby crying ? MRS . HALEVY No , not seen her  --  But when she 's been crying all night , I can tell in the morning . FLORRIE SANDS Well , if it 's as bad as all that  --  MRS . HALEVY Oh , it is  --  p. 15 FLORRIE SANDS Why , he 'll probably keep her waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all  --  MRS . HALEVY I suppose so . FLORRIE SANDS Or else she 'll just drift along waiting for somebody like him and the first thing we know she 'll be an old maid and a public charge . MRS . HALEVY She 's only twenty-three . FLORRIE SANDS Well , was n't I married at twenty-three ? It 's easy to get married before you 're twenty-five but afterwards try and do it . If only she was n't such an egg ! MRS . HALEVY HorrifiedSuch a what ? FLORRIE SANDS Such an egg ! MRS . HALEVY Florrie ! FLORRIE SANDS I know , but she 's so unhatched , somehow  --  she does n't know her way around the block  --  she never did . MRS . HALEVY People do wait sometimes  --  sometimes they wait for years  --  and then it comes out all right . We waited  --  FLORRIE SANDS Oh , I know , but that was different . MRS . HALEVY Yes , I suppose so . It was all different then . p. 16 FLORRIE SANDS A door closes outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall door . FLORRIE SANDS Bobby , dear , I have n't seen you for an age ! BOBBY EnteringWell , why should you , darling ? Do n't be sloppy . Ugh , I 've just come from the subway ! Let me at the bath-tub before you kiss me . FLORRIE SANDS We 've been waiting to see you . BOBBY How 's the baby ? FLORRIE SANDS Wonderful . MRS . HALEVY Have you had dinner , dear ? BOBBY Taking off an orchidI do n't know . Yes , I guess so . MRS . HALEVY You do n't know ? BOBBY Yes  --  I was  --  I was in a place where they were eating . It must have been dinner . FLORRIE SANDS Fascinating company ? BOBBY Just the boss . Mengle . FLORRIE SANDS Since when does Mr. Mengle take you to dinner ? BOBBY Ever since six o'clock and it 's been a long time . p. 17 FLORRIE SANDS And his conversation was so charming you could n't think of food ? BOBBY Vague and a little boredI hope he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear a word he said . FLORRIE SANDS Well , dearest , when you go to dinner with a man you ought to at least listen to him . BOBBY I 'll get him to say it over again sometime . He wo n't mind . If he does he can always fire me . FLORRIE SANDS Well , you need n't have worried and spoiled poor Mengel 's evening , for Rims did telephone , if that 's what you want to know . BOBBY Rims ? Rims telephoned ? FLORRIE SANDS I think that 's the name . Rims  --  Rims Murphy  --  MRS . HALEVY O'Neil , dear . FLORRIE SANDS Oh , yes , O'Neil . BOBBY What did he say ? FLORRIE SANDS He wanted to know if you 'd be in this evening . BOBBY Oh . FLORRIE SANDS I said you were going to a dance or something , but if he came right over  --  p. 18 BOBBY Oh , I 'm not going anywhere . FLORRIE SANDS Well , why tell him that ? You do n't want him to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should he think I 'm weeping ? Did you know I was n't going out ? MRS . HALEVY I told her you were n't , Bobby  --  BOBBY Then I do n't see what occasion there was for  --  FLORRIE SANDS Child , you 'll never know ; you 'll never , never know . You 're just that innocent . BOBBY Oh  --  well , he 'll know I was n't going anywhere  --  because I 'll be here . FLORRIE SANDS Could n't you change your mind ? At any rate you ca n't tell him you were n't going out because I told him you were . BOBBY Could n't you be mistaken , dear ? I think you could . I even think you were . FLORRIE SANDS You would ! BOBBY I think it 's perfectly silly . FLORRIE SANDS You 're quite hopeless , darling  --  I doubt if I can do anything for you , but I can tell you this . BOBBY Yes ? p. 19 FLORRIE SANDS If you want a man to be interested in you , let him see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want a man to come running , just let him imagine you at a dance with someone else . BOBBY You 're pretty tiresome tonight , Florrie . If I cared enough about anybody to want to keep him  --  I 'd care too much to want to keep him that way . FLORRIE SANDS My God , can anybody be as young as that and live ! MRS . HALEVY Well , Bobby is right , Florrie  --  Bobby is right ! FLORRIE SANDS Mother , you never grew up a day after you were married . MRS . HALEVY Well  --  I 'm glad I 've stayed young then . FLORRIE SANDS Do you know what I want you to do ? BOBBY It does n't matter . I would n't do it . FLORRIE SANDS I want you to put on your prettiest party dress . You were going to a dance , you see , and then Rims 'll come in and you 'll decide not to go . It just gives you a chance to look your best . Do n't you see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FLORRIE SANDS Are n't you , dear ? p. 20 BOBBY Not the least in the world . FLORRIE SANDS Oh , well , do n't do it then . Because if you did he might ask you to marry him or something and then you 'd have to turn him down and it 'd be such a bother . BOBBY Yes , I know . There 's nothing like a proposal to spoil an evening . I 've been so unfortunate that way . MRS . HALEVY Well , you have had two in a week , Bobby . BOBBY Three , mother . FLORRIE SANDS Was it Mengle ? BOBBY Yes , I think that 's what he was talking about a good deal of the time  --  whenever he was n't talking about the music business . The music business , by the way , is very good . MRS . HALEVY But Mr. Mengle 's married , dear . BOBBY Oh , this was n't a proposal of marriage . It was just a  --  proposal . MRS . HALEVY But Bobby  --  you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would n't say that , mother . BOBBY  --  No  --  you see , I think probably I got the job because he had hopes of me . Hope springs eternal in the employer 's breast . p. 21 MRS . HALEVY What did you say to him ? BOBBY I did n't disillusion him completely . It 's better for Mr. Mengle 's hopes to go on springing eternal . MRS . HALEVY He must be a beast  --  BOBBY He 's a rather friendly old beast , and very considerate , really . FLORRIE SANDS He did n't mean anything , mother . MRS . HALEVY But it 's really terrible  --  for a young girl  --  FLORRIE SANDS Will you put on the party dress ? BOBBY I might if I had one . FLORRIE SANDS The pink one ! BOBBY She pauses , looking at Florrie , decides it is not worth arguing about . She reaches in her bag and pulls out a coinHeads or tails . FLORRIE SANDS Heads ! BOBBY Flipping it You win . FLORRIE SANDS The pink dress . BOBBY Anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never would have done it if I 'd asked her . p. 22 FLORRIE SANDS Use just the right touch and you can get her to do anything . You see , mother , she 's just a child . There 's a psychologist writing for the American that says people do n't really begin to think until they 're nearly thirty . They walk around and talk and they seem human , but they 're really practically unconscious . MRS . HALEVY I do wish you would n't read the American , dear . FLORRIE SANDS Well , sometimes I think it 's really true . That 's one reason why it 's easy for a girl to get married young , and not so easy afterward . The idea is to catch your man while he 's still unconscious . If he begins to think about it there really is n't any reason why he should get married at all . And so the psychologist says the only hope for a girl is to start thinking young and that 's why girls have to be cleverer than men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of such things . FLORRIE SANDS He 's paid to . I could think of nearly anything if I was paid to . There is a terrible crash of wood and metal in the next room . MRS . HALEVY Good Heavens ! Merlin what did you do to it ? MRS . HALEVY Entering from leftNothing. p. 23 FLORRIE SANDS But it sounded as if  --  MR . HALEVY It will sound no more , my darling . The infernal machine that wrecked our peace is forever silenced . MRS . HALEVY What have you done ? MR . HALEVY Filling his pipeI have murdered the entire Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra , from Stokowski to the timpani player . I tried everything else on that Goddam machine and it did n't do any good , so I tried smashing it . From now on if we want any music we 'll go where it is . MRS . HALEVY I do n't know what 's come over you , Merlin . You 're so sudden lately . MR . HALEVY Yeah ! Toward the end of his life the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by gentleness and compromise , begins to assert himself . You did n't want me to build a radio and I built it anyway . After I got it built I did n't like it so I smashed it . If you tell me to get another one I wo n't . If you tell me not to get another one I will . WILLY enters from left with a newspaper in his hand . FLORRIE SANDS It 's best not to tell him anything , mother . MRS . HALEVY Goodness knows I never tried to tell him anything . p. 24 FLORRIE SANDS As for Willy it would n't dream of trying to tell him anything , would it ? WILLY SANDS Darling , how would I know anything if you did n't tell me ? FLORRIE SANDS You would n't . WILLY SANDS Not a thing . The telephone rings . FLORRIE SANDS Answering itHello ! No .

HALEVY What 's the row about , girlies ? FLORRIE SANDS Nothing whatever . WILLY SANDS I gather Florrie thinks Bobby 's going out tonight and Bobby thinks she is n't . MR . HALEVY Well , Bobby ought to know . p. 26 MRS . HALEVY Now , what 's Rims going to think ? BOBBY I 'll tell him exactly what happened . FLORRIE SANDS Well , he wo n't believe you . BOBBY Of course he 'll believe me . FLORRIE SANDS You mean to say you 're coming out in that pink dress and tell him you were n't going anywhere ?

That 's the point , and the kids ought to have a chance to say goodbye . MR .

FLORRIE SANDS Bobby , you are in love with him . p. 31 BOBBY I 'm not in love with anybody that is n't in love with me . FLORRIE SANDS But he is . BOBBY No he is n't , if he was he 'd have  --  well , it does n't matter only I wish you 'd go . FLORRIE SANDS It 's all right , dear . I 'll go the minute he comes . And listen  --  he is in love with you . I know by his voice over the phone . And if you want him , dear , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to Buenos Ayres to start a branch house . It may take two years . FLORRIE SANDS Do n't let him . BOBBY If he wants to go , why should n't he ? FLORRIE SANDS Because you 're in love with each other , and you 'd be much happier if he stayed here , would n't you ? BOBBY It does n't matter . FLORRIE SANDS You know what will happen ? He 'll fall in love with someone else . BOBBY Well , so will I , probably . FLORRIE SANDS You thought he was going to ask you to marry him , did n't you ? BOBBY Yes . p. 32 FLORRIE SANDS And if he 'd stayed a little longer he would have , would n't he ? BOBBY Yes . FLORRIE SANDS Then he 'll ask you tonight . BOBBY No he wo n't . He 's made up his mind not to . FLORRIE SANDS Darling , he did n't tell you that ? BOBBY No , but I know . FLORRIE SANDS Oh , if I could only be in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't I get it out of him ! BOBBY What would you do ? FLORRIE SANDS I 'd tease him  --  till he was wild . BOBBY Well , I wo n't . FLORRIE SANDS I guess you 're just too good to live . BOBBY No , it is n't that . I like him too much to cheat him into anything . FLORRIE SANDS Darling , if you knew just half a dozen sentences to say that would make him propose to you , would you say them ? BOBBY No , I would n't . FLORRIE SANDS It 's so easy  --  When he asks if you were n't really going out with somebody , tell him you were going out with Fred  --  has he ever seen Fred ? p. 33 BOBBY No , but you 're just wasting your time , Florrie . FLORRIE turns to table , rises , gets pad and pencil . FLORRIE SANDS Look , dear , I 'm writing it down  --  can you read my shorthand ? BOBBY I could if I wanted to  --  FLORRIE SANDS You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see ?  --  and then Rims will come in and ask you to stay with him this evening  --  and you 'll say yes , you 'll call it off when Fred telephones  --  and then I 'll telephone  --  is n't it easy ? BOBBY It does n't interest me . FLORRIE SANDS Then he 'll ask you to go somewhere with him and you 'll suddenly take out your hanky and begin to cry a little and say you do n't want to go anywhere . BOBBY Me  --  cry  --  me ? FLORRIE SANDS Yes , darling , you . You 'll weep a little and he 'll ask you what 's the matter and try to comfort you , and  --  BOBBY I ca n't cry on order  --  FLORRIE SANDS Oh , yes , you can , dear . BOBBY Anyway , I never cry . p. 34 FLORRIE SANDS Well , he 'll ask you what 's the matter , and then you 'll say , " Oh , I 'm so tired of  --  of everything , Rims  --  and I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll say , " Oh , yes , you are , " and he 'll put his arm around you  --  or would he ? BOBBY How could he help it ? FLORRIE SANDS Well , after that it gets easier all the time  --  you just say , " Rims dear , sometimes you 're the only person in the world I can talk to  --  sometimes I ca n't bear to be with anybody else "  --  BOBBY I simply could n't FLORRIE SANDS But that 's exactly what you 've got to say  --  and then you go right on and say , " Rims , do n't you ever get tired of poor me ,  --  ever ? " BOBBY And then he 'd say " Never , " of course . FLORRIE SANDS Of course  --  and you say , " You 're such a darling  --  and it 's going to be awfully hard "  --  BOBBY What is ? FLORRIE SANDS That 's exactly what he 'll say  --  " What is ? " and you 'll say , " Marrying somebody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You getting married ? " and you 'll say , " Oh , Rims , a girl has to get married sometime , you know , while she 's got chances , " and he 'll say , " How many chances do you get in a week ? " or something like that , and you 'll say , " I 've had two every other week for two weeks , " or something , and he 'll say " Now kid , you do n't mean you 've set to marry somebody ? " and then you 'll say  --  p. 35 BOBBY Oh , no , I wo n't FLORRIE SANDS Yes , you will , dear , you 'll say , " Fred wants me to marry him , and he 's awfully in love with me and I do n't want to go on working forever , " and he 'll say , " Well , if you 're getting married this season , why not marry me ? "  --  and there you are  --  BOBBY No , because he would n't say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't such a sap for one thing , and for another I do n't think it 's fair and I would n't do it . FLORRIE SANDS My darling , how do you think people get married ? BOBBY I do n't know . FLORRIE SANDS I 'll say you do n't  --  BOBBY Honestly , do you think a person of any sense would fall for a deliberate trap like that ? FLORRIE SANDS Why , honeybunch , hundreds of thousands of them fall for it every year . The doorbell rings . There 's one coming now . I 'm running along , dear . And , look , I 'm leaving those notes  --  see ?  --  BOBBY You 'd better take them  --  FLORRIE SANDS Shut the note-book if you feel scrupulous  --  you 'll probably remember the system anyway  --  it comes natural  --  Bye-bye ! I 'll just pass him in the door . She goes out . Oh , pardon me ! p. 36 RIMS O'NEIL Off-stageThat 's all right ! FLORRIE SANDS OffI was just going out . RIMS O'NEIL OffIs Miss Halevy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Bobby ! BOBBY Yes . FLORRIE SANDS OffSomeone for you  --  RIMS O'NEIL OffO'Neil 's the name  --  FLORRIE SANDS OffMr .

RIMS O'NEIL Flaming youth ! Bobby , you 're a dream in that ! Stand still and let me gaze at you ! BOBBY You like it ? p. 37 RIMS O'NEIL Do I ? Why have n't I seen you in that before ? BOBBY I just made it . RIMS O'NEIL You made it ? Say , I wish you 'd make my clothes for me for a while . I 'd have them falling for me from the third story windows ! BOBBY Oh , any old clothes will do in Buenos Ayres . They say they fall easy down there . RIMS O'NEIL Yeah ? BOBBY They say it 's the climate . RIMS O'NEIL I 'll bet the climate ca n't raise ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sweeter  --  Say , you were stepping out somewhere , were n't you ? BOBBY No , I was n't . RIMS O'NEIL Sure , your sister said you had a heavy date on . BOBBY Well , I did n't . RIMS O'NEIL You 're a poor liar , kid , if that 's anything against you  --  BOBBY But I say I did n't have a date  --  RIMS O'NEIL What 's the dress for  --  just trying it on ? BOBBY No , it was to settle a bet  --  RIMS O'NEIL I 'll bet it was  --  Anyway I 'm sorry for the other guy and it 's sweet of you to turn down a dance for me  --  p. 38 BOBBY Wait a minute . I have n't turned it down yet  --  RIMS O'NEIL Is he coming for you ? BOBBY He 's going to telephone . RIMS O'NEIL Aw , give him the air , sweetheart . I want to talk to you . I have n't seen you for a week . BOBBY All right . Only it is n't my fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'NEIL As he turns chair around and sits right center facing BobbyGee , nobody 's seen me . I have n't been able to see myself in the mirror the rate I was travelling . I 've learned more about the Argentine in the last week than I ever knew about New York  --  principal cities , population , theatres , cabarets , rates of exchange , sheet music sales , what the girls like to dance to , how late they stay up  --  you ought to hear old Juan giving me a quiz  --  BOBBY So you 're really going ? RIMS O'NEIL It certainly looks that way  --  of course , the boss has n't actually O.K. 'd it yet but he seems to be sold on it  --  BOBBY Oh , so far as he 's concerned it 's going through . RIMS O'NEIL How do you know ? p. 39 BOBBY Well , I found out . RIMS O'NEIL Great stuff ! Has he settled on me to go , do you know ? BOBBY Oh , absolutely ! RIMS O'NEIL You know I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been coaching me but I 'm pretty dumb , I guess . And there 's a lot of fellows at the office that rank me for experience  --  But say , that 's great , kid . BOBBY Of course , it 's in confidence .  --  RIMS O'NEIL Sure thing . How 'd you find out ? Dictation ? BOBBY He told me . RIMS O'NEIL He did n't talk it over with you ? BOBBY I had dinner with him . RIMS O'NEIL Say , that 's not so good , girlie . That bird 's a pirate . BOBBY Well , I have to have dinner with somebody , do n't I ? And you have n't been giving anybody much competition  --  RIMS O'NEIL It was n't because I did n't want to , though . You know every night I 've thought maybe I could get away and then some damn complication fixed it so I could n't . BOBBY Oh , I know . p. 40 RIMS O'NEIL You know I have n't seen you since  --  Well  --  BOBBY Think hard . RIMS O'NEIL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week ago tonight . RIMS O'NEIL You 're right . And Mengle sprung this thing on me the next day . You mean I have n't seen you since that night on the bus ? BOBBY Really , do n't you remember ? RIMS O'NEIL Gee , I 'm a wash-out , girlie ; this thing 's wrecked me . Say , I wish you were coming along . BOBBY Maybe Mengle 'll let you have a stenographer  --  RIMS O'NEIL No chance , I guess . He 's doing this on a shoe-string  --  the way he does everything . Anyway , I 'm not the boss  --  Old Juan 's in charge ; I 'm just a kind of super-cargo . They 've got to have somebody that can write English well it was certainly a nice Spring while it lasted . BOBBY The best I ever had , Rims . RIMS O'NEIL Me too . You know Bobby , I 'll never see a Fifth Avenue bus without thinking of you , never . BOBBY You wo n't see one for a while , though . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Grant 's Tomb or the Soldier 's and Sailor 's monument would do just as well  --  BOBBY I 'll send you one with an X to mark the spot on it . RIMS O'NEIL Which spot , though ? The route 's sprinkled with ' em . BOBBY Well , where you said your poem to me , for instance . RIMS O'NEIL Yeah ? Well , it was n't much of a poem if you ask me . BOBBY Rims , it was a lovely poem ! RIMS O'NEIL I thought it was pretty good at the time  --  but I guess it was pretty rank  --  I do n't think I 'm going to try poetry again for a while  --  BOBBY Not till you fall in love again , I suppose . RIMS O'NEIL No , that 's the kind of thing only happens once . BOBBY Anyway , it 's the only poem anybody ever wrote for me  --  She says it musingly . When Bobby comes to the officeThe boss takes off his frown ; She wears a coat of powder blueAnd a powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You always make me think it 's good , the way you can say it  --  The telephone ringsIf that 's your playmate tell him your 're busy , will you ? p. 42 BOBBY Do you want to stick around , really ? RIMS O'NEIL Sure I do . BOBBY At the telephoneHello . Oh , yes . Why , Fred . She turns her back on RimsI 'm awfully sorry , but I ca n't go . No , really I ca n't . No , do n't come over , please . It is n't that . I 'll tell you when I see you . I 'm awfully sorry . Yes . Goodbye . She hangs up and turns to face him , radiant . There ! RIMS O'NEIL You 're a brick , Bobby . Are you sure you did n't want to go ? BOBBY If I 'd wanted to  --  I would have . There is a pause . RIMS O'NEIL I 've been wanting to talk to you . BOBBY What about , Rims ? RIMS O'NEIL Do you think it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's an awfully good opening . RIMS O'NEIL Well , what I mean is , do n't you think it 's a good thing for a young fellow to see the world a little when he gets a chance  --  just so he can kind of make up his mind what he wants to do ? BOBBY Surely . p. 43 RIMS O'NEIL That 's why I 'm going , really . Oh , I 'm not sure it 's any great shakes of an opening , but I never have been much of anywhere and it 's a chance  --  well , it 's a kind of adventure , do n't you see ? BOBBY Surely . RIMS O'NEIL At a lossThat 's why I 'm going . BOBBY Yes . A pause . RIMS O'NEIL And , kid  --  BOBBY Yes ? RIMS O'NEIL Placing a hand on her armYou certainly have been wonderful to me . BOBBY We did have a good Spring together , did n't we ? RIMS O'NEIL You were certainly marvellous . BOBBY looks at him , and then turns away . BOBBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that 's no reason you should n't give me a kiss , is it ? BOBBY I guess not . They kiss . Maybe you 'd better run along , Rims . RIMS O'NEIL Why so , sweetie ? The night 's young . p. 44 BOBBY Well  --  She looks down and her eye falls on Florrie 's notebook . She looks at it fascinated . There is a pause . RIMS O'NEIL LightlyWhat you studying , Bobby ? BOBBY Nothing . Only  --  oh , I 'm so tired of everything , Rims , and I 'm afraid I 'm not very good company . RIMS O'NEIL Oh , yes , you are . BOBBY Rims , dear  --  RIMS O'NEIL Yes . BOBBY She looks back at bookRims , sometimes you 're the only person in the world I can talk to . Sometimes I ca n't bear to be with anybody else . RIMS O'NEIL Gee , kid . BOBBY Rims , do n't you ever get tired of poor me , ever ? RIMS O'NEIL Never , I should say not . BOBBY You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't say that . BOBBY But you are , She turns and glances at the notebookand it 's going to be awfully hard . A pause. p. 45 RIMS O'NEIL What is , sweetheart ? BOBBY Marrying somebody else . RIMS O'NEIL You getting married ? His hand drops from her shoulder BOBBY Oh , Rims , a girl 's got to get married sometime you know , while she 's got chances . RIMS O'NEIL I suppose you get chances all right . BOBBY Yes . RIMS O'NEIL Do they come fast ? BOBBY I 've had two  --  every other week , for two weeks . RIMS O'NEIL Say , look here , you do n't mean you 're making up your mind to marry somebody in particular ? BOBBY Well , Fred wants me to marry him , and he 's awfully in love with me , and I do n't want to go on working forever . RIMS O'NEIL I see . Yeah , I see . I did n't know you felt that way . BOBBY Breaking awayWell , I do n't , really . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better go , dear . I would n't marry anybody . I would n't marry  --  anybody . Not even you . RIMS O'NEIL You would n't ? p. 46 BOBBY No , I would n't ! RIMS O'NEIL Oh , yes , you will . I mean  --  BOBBY Do you want me too ? RIMS O'NEIL Sweetheart  --  I do n't want anything else . They kiss . BOBBY Breaking away and crying on his shoulder . But you 're  --  you 're going to South America  --  RIMS O'NEIL Still holding her@@ The O'NEILS ' kitchen-dining room .

I moved them because I had to . What do you think I did with them ? p. 48 RIMS O'NEIL OffI give up . BOBBY Going in to help himSilly . I 'll find them . RIMS O'NEIL Oh , hell , I 'm all out of tobacco . Where 's my cigarettes ? BOBBY Re-enteringOh , here they are . Mine were all gone . RIMS O'NEIL Gosh , there 's only one left . BOBBY She picks up her cigaretteThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'NEIL Yeah , but I had half a package here . BOBBY I know . I asked you to bring me some last night , but I guess you forgot it .  --  RIMS O'NEIL Lighting cigaretteWell , I did n't really forget it , only I was running so low on cash  --  BOBBY But you got paid to-day . RIMS O'NEIL Yeah , only I did forget ' em this afternoon . BOBBY You see . I thought sure you 'd bring some , dear . RIMS O'NEIL Throwing match in ash tray , and smoking contentedlyIt 's all right . p. 49 BOBBY I do n't see how you could be low in cash . You do n't eat it all , do you ? RIMS O'NEIL What do you expect on five dollars a week ? BOBBY You never seem to have any money . RIMS O'NEIL Well , now , the truth is , I took a couple of passes at peanuckle last week , and they ruined me . BOBBY But , Rims , if you do that  --  RIMS O'NEIL Hell , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to stick to the budget , dear , or we 'll never come out even . I 've been over everything this afternoon and it 's awfully close figuring . RIMS O'NEIL We 're going to be lucky if we get by . BOBBY FlashingI wish you would n't talk that way , Rims . There 's no luck about it . It 's just figures . She gets out her account book . Listen  --  this is the way it adds up . RIMS O'NEIL Say , kiddie , spare me the horrible details . BOBBY No , it 's the treasurer 's report  --  you 've got to hear it or we ca n't co-operate . RIMS O'NEIL You know I 've tried that and it does n't do any good . p. 50 BOBBY But you did n't stick to it , then ! RIMS O'NEIL Hell , I could n't . Every time I thought I had it all worked out some damn thing would come along and sink me for a month . I know . BOBBY Well , listen , anyway . RIMS O'NEIL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month and when there 's five weeks in a month we get $300 . RIMS O'NEIL Sounds like too much money  --  how much is it in a year ? BOBBY Do n't interrupt . Two hundred and forty a month and out of that we pay sixty for rent , about thirty-five for groceries , forty on the furniture , twenty for your allowance , ten insurance , about six for gas and light , and about three for ice . And it comes to a hundred and seventy-four . RIMS O'NEIL You must have left something out . BOBBY Still intentPlease ! A hundred and seventy- four from two hundred and forty leaves sixty-six dollars  --  RIMS O'NEIL Then how do I happen to be broke all the time ? BOBBY Of course , if it does n't interest you  --  RIMS O'NEIL Sure it interests me , Bobby . You know , I 've got a great idea , girlie . How about a little game of black jack for that sixty-six dollars ? p. 51 BOBBY Rims , you idiot ! If you do n't take me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of your own dirty old money ! I can earn some for myself ! RIMS O'NEIL Ah , take it easy , Bobby . I was only fooling . BOBBY Will you really listen ? RIMS O'NEIL Sure I will ! Geez , I 've been listening . BOBBY Oh , it is n't any use . You do n't think it matters but I know it does . RIMS O'NEIL Mock-seriousDo n't I know it matters ? Why , kid , if you can figure out how we can save sixty-six a month  --  well  --  you 're good . BOBBY I did n't say we could save that much . We have to use that for clothes and dentist and doctor 's bills and extras  --  RIMS O'NEIL No , say , there 's certainly something wrong here  --  BOBBY But just a minute . I know we 'll just throw it away and never know where it goes if we do n't use some system , so I want you to write down everything you spend and I 'll do the same and every evening we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of pleasant evenings ahead  --  p. 52 BOBBY But I mean it , dear .

I knew a guy that did that . BOBBY I think it 's very sensible . RIMS O'NEIL Flaring upAnd make me accountable to you for every cent I spend ? BOBBY Oh , is that the way you look at it ? RIMS O'NEIL That 's what it amounts to , is n't it ? BOBBY RisingWell , then , I guess we wo n't discuss the matter any further . I 'll finish the dishes . Pause . RIMS O'NEIL Taking notebook and studying itNo , wait a minute . There 's something away out here . BOBBY Busy with the dishesIt does n't matter . RIMS O'NEIL Well , look here ! Where do you get that two forty a month stuff ? We do n't get any two forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over everything . RIMS O'NEIL I know , but you 're wrong . I get forty dollars a week . Four times forty 's just 160 A pause . BOBBY Oh ! .. oh oh , what a fool ! I know what I did  --  but I could never tell you  --  I must have put down sixty a week to start  --  but you 'd never see how I could  --  RIMS O'NEIL It makes a hell of a big difference , I 'll say  --  BOBBY Oh , I 'm such a fool . It was just because Mengle had spoken of a raise  --  and I started to figure it on the basis of a new salary  --  and then I forgot and thought I 'd started with forty dollars  --  no , I ca n't see how I did it ! Suddenly face to face with it . Well , then , there 's just no use , you see . We get 160 and our expenses are 174 and  --  RIMS O'NEIL Well , that 's round numbers , you know . BOBBY We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we ca n't live on 160 a month . RIMS O'NEIL Well , some months it 's more . Extra pay-days . BOBBY I suppose that 's what 's saved us so far . p. 54 RIMS O'NEIL And then I 'm going to get more , too , you know . BOBBY I hope so . RIMS O'NEIL And , I do  --  I do appreciate it  --  you 're taking the trouble to figure it all out  --  only it 's a kind of a blow too . He rises . I did n't know it was so close . Gosh , I never used to have any money troubles to speak of  --  I just ran along  --  BOBBY Well , so did I. I wish I had n't quit my job . RIMS O'NEIL Well , we both could n't work in the same office after we got married . It does n't go somehow . BOBBY It would have been embarrassing , but  --  it would n't really matter . RIMS O'NEIL Well , I 'd mind if you did n't . It would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to support my wife . BOBBY How I hate that word . RIMS O'NEIL What word ? BOBBY Wife ! I wo n't be a wife ! It sounds so fat and stupid ! I wish we had n't got married ! I wish you 'd gone to South America . RIMS O'NEIL  --  Well , you have n't got anything on me. p. 55 BOBBY GentlyNo , I did n't mean that , dear . It 's not true . RIMS O'NEIL As a matter of fact , I meant to go to South America . BOBBY I know . RIMS O'NEIL And then I went to see you  --  and I guess I just had to have you  --  that 's all . BOBBY Burying her head on his shoulderNo , it was me . I had to  --  have you . It was my fault . RIMS O'NEIL Holding her closeNo , I knew what I was doing all right . And hell , I  --  I still feel that way . You look like a million dollars to me every time I see you . BOBBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you ? RIMS O'NEIL Honest , kid , nobody ever loved anybody the way I love you . I 'm just silly about you . I think about you all day long . And then I come home at night and  --  He turns awaywe get into some goddam mess  --  and it just shoots the works  --  BOBBY I know . It 's just the same way with me . I think all day how marvellous it 's going to be when you come home  --  and then you get here  --  and I do n't know  --  it is n't marvellous at all  --  It 's just a house and we 're just married people  --  and  --  sometimes I hate it  --  everything 's getting spoiled  --  p. 56 RIMS O'NEIL I guess it 's mostly relatives and  --  money . BOBBY And pipe cleaners and clothes  --  and meals and  --  dishes  --  oh , I have n't touched those dishes yet  --  RIMS O'NEIL Anyway , you 're marvellous , kid . You really are . BOBBY Even when I 'm doing dishes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to prove it I 'm going to help you with them . BOBBY I do n't want you to have to do dishes . RIMS O'NEIL Gee , I wish you did n't have to . BOBBY I even wish you never had to see me doing dishes . I almost wish I was somebody else 's wife  --  so you could be my lover  --  and come to see me when he was n't home  --  RIMS O'NEIL Well , I do n't know about that  --  BOBBY No , not really , I mean : but do n't you see it would be better  --  because you 'd always like me then  --  and you 'd always want to see me and we 'd have to scheme and meet places and you 'd hate the old brute that owned me . RIMS O'NEIL The only trouble is I 'm the old brute that owns you  --  p. 57 BOBBY Only you 're not an old brute  --  but if you were  --  oh , I 'd have the handsomest , dearest lover  --  just like you ! RIMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all right  --  BOBBY Oh , I do . He 'd be wealthy , you see  --  RIMS O'NEIL Who would ? BOBBY The brute would , and I 'd have all the men in the world to choose from  --  and I 'd take Rims . RIMS O'NEIL If you feel that way , what do we care if we 're poor . BOBBY Ai n't it the truth ? RIMS O'NEIL His arms round herAnd you can lose my pipe-cleaners and add up wrong and have relatives to dinner and smoke my cigarettes forever and I wo n't get mad . BOBBY I guess it was me got mad . I always do . RIMS O'NEIL Compared to me you never get mad . BOBBY Smiling and going back to the dishesOnly I do n't think my relatives are so very terrible , do you ? RIMS O'NEIL I guess not . No more'n most relatives . p. 58 BOBBY And they do n't come here so very often , do they ? RIMS O'NEIL Well , they were here last night . BOBBY Yes . RIMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before that . BOBBY Yes , it is true . It 's partly because Florrie helped plant the garden . RIMS O'NEIL You know the old man 's all right , but that sister of yours does kind of give me the pip , and what that Willy boy ever married her for is more than I can figure out . They actually think they own this place just because they saw it first . BOBBY Going to himDarling , as soon as the lease runs out we 'll move . RIMS O'NEIL When do we pay the rent ? BOBBY It 's due day after tomorrow . RIMS O'NEIL Could it wait ? BOBBY It wo n't have to . With to-day 's money we can just do it . RIMS O'NEIL Well , I was going to ask you  --  they 're having a stag blow-out for old Juan  --  he 's just back from South America and he 's retiring and the boys are getting him something , chipping in , you know . Do you think I could take five out of the rent money ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about three . p. 59 BOBBY Now , why should you give Juan anything ? RIMS O'NEIL Well , he was pretty good to me , Bobby  --  and after the way I dropped out of the South America thing I do n't want to look like a crab . BOBBY When is it ? RIMS O'NEIL Wednesday . BOBBY Wednesday ? Really ? RIMS O'NEIL Yeah . BOBBY That 's funny . RIMS O'NEIL Why ? BOBBY Guess who called me up to-day ? RIMS O'NEIL Fred ? BOBBY No . Mengle . RIMS O'NEIL The boss  --  ? What did he want ? BOBBY Well , first he wanted to know if I 'd come back and work for him  --  RIMS O'NEIL BelligerentlyOh , he did , did he ? I 'd like to see you  --  BOBBY Well , I said no , and he said , " Come down and see me sometime , " and I said , " All right , " and he said " Why do n't you come and have dinner sometime , " and I said , " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday night ? " p. 60 RIMS O'NEIL What did you tell him ? BOBBY I told him I 'd call up and let him know . RIMS O'NEIL Why did n't you tell him to go to the devil ? BOBBY Well , I 'd been going over these figures and I thought if our income was doubled  --  how easy it would be  --  and if I just took my job back  --  RIMS O'NEIL Get this from me right now , kid . I wo n't have you sitting in Mengle 's private office taking dictation . It was bad enough before we were married . BOBBY Well , I guess I 'll do as I please about that , my dear . RIMS O'NEIL You will not ! You 'll do as I tell you . BOBBY IcilyI might if you asked me nicely , but  --  RIMS O'NEIL I 'm not asking you ! I 'm telling you , and that 's once for all ! And you wo n't go to dinner with him , either ! BOBBY I did n't intend to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let me , I certainly will . RIMS O'NEIL Oh , no , you wo n't . BOBBY Yes ? RIMS O'NEIL Yeah , that 'd put me in a nice position , would n't it ? Me at the banquet and you dining alone with Mengle. p. 61 BOBBY Well , I 've had dinner with him before and it did n't seem to hurt your position much . RIMS O'NEIL That was before we were married ! BOBBY Well , Good God , what 's the difference ? RIMS O'NEIL You know damn well what 's the difference . BOBBY Oh dear , we 're quarreling again  --  over nothing . RIMS O'NEIL You call that nothing ! Anyway , what the hell do I care if we are ? I come home here every evening just because you 're here  --  and what thanks do I get for it ? They had a game going over at Perry 's and I certainly wish I 'd gone . BOBBY I certainly wish you had . I suppose you come home every evening just to keep me company  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'NEIL Sometimes I do . BOBBY Well , go to your game . I wo n't be lonely . Any time you do n't come home I can amuse myself plenty . RIMS O'NEIL All right ! BOBBY I had a bid out myself to-night if you want to know . RIMS O'NEIL Who was it ? BOBBY Do n't you wish you knew ? p. 62 RIMS O'NEIL Was it Mengle ? BOBBY No it was Fred . He said he was all alone at the club party to-night and he wished I was going to be there . RIMS O'NEIL Are you going ? BOBBY Why , darling , I was staying home to keep you company . But I would n't mind seeing another man once in a while  --  now that 's the truth . The door-bell ringsI wonder who that is ? RIMS O'NEIL You know all right . It 's that sister of yours and her Willy boy . That 's who it always is . BOBBY Rims ! She goes out to open the door . RIMS puts on his coat and drops a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorOh , there you are . We were just going round to the back . BOBBY In the front roomHello , Florrie . Hello , Willy . WILLY SANDS OffI did n't want to come , Bobby , but she made me . FLORRIE SANDS OffWilly , you 're making me furious ! p. 63 WILLY SANDS OffI know damn well they do n't want a lot of old married folks running in on ' em at all hours . BOBBY OffCome on out to the kitchen  --  we 're just finishing the dishes . BOBBY re-enters , bringing FLORRIE and WILLY . FLORRIE SANDS Hello , Rims , darling . RIMS O'NEIL Over his shoulderHello . WILLY SANDS Hello , Rims . RIMS O'NEIL Hello . FLORRIE SANDS Such a heavenly night you never saw ! And a lovely , lovely moon . WILLY SANDS That was n't any moon . That was a street lamp . FLORRIE SANDS Oh , all right , grumpie , there was n't any moon . There , does n't that prove I love him ? Because there really is a moon . WILLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . I 'm always wrong . And all the North and South streets do run east and west , and the sun does rise over New Jersey , just as you said . What did you ever marry me for if you do n't like me ? p. 64 WILLY SANDS Yeah , this is a fine time to ask me that . FLORRIE SANDS I wish I had a perfect husband like Rims , that never got sulky . Rims , when I get my divorce , will you marry me ? Shall we fly together ? RIMS O'NEIL I 'm going out and get some cigarets . WILLY SANDS Mind if I come along ? RIMS O'NEIL Nope . FLORRIE SANDS Well say , come back after me , do you hear ? WILLY SANDS Following RIMS outYeah ! FLORRIE SANDS Well , darling . Did I hear sounds of family revelry ,  --  and is the husband in a vile mood ?  --  not really ? BOBBY What did you hear ? FLORRIE SANDS Only the breaking of furniture and the fall of crockery . Who wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . The evening row . BOBBY I guess neither of us won . I guess we both lost . FLORRIE SANDS Then it 's a draw , stupid . Only why take it seriously . It 's the one that takes it seriously that loses . p. 65 BOBBY It 's not funny , Florrie . FLORRIE SANDS You child  --  it is funny . You 're going through a period of adjustment and it 's always funny . There 's a man writing for the American  --  BOBBY Yes , I know  --  FLORRIE SANDS Well , he says , there 's always a period of adjustment before it 's settled who 's to boss the other one , and the period of adjustment is just one long series of rows . BOBBY I see . FLORRIE SANDS SighingWilly and I are nearing the end of our period of adjustment . Willy still struggles . BOBBY Then  --  I guess I do n't want to be married . If it 's like that . FLORRIE SANDS Of course you want to be married , my dear . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of us . Women can talk all they please about living their own lives  --  I do n't believe it . It 's all sour grapes . BOBBY It is n't sour grapes with me . It  --  it just kills me to quarrel with him  --  and it 's always happening ! Florrie , I do n't know what to do . FLORRIE SANDS There 's nothing to do . It 's quite usual . p. 66 BOBBY You mean people always quarrel when they 're married , even when they 're in love , madly in love ? FLORRIE SANDS Well , I never knew a case where they did n't . BOBBY It ca n't be true . FLORRIE SANDS Naturally you do n't go on being madly in love forever . Not if you 're married to the person . BOBBY But why ? FLORRIE SANDS Silly , you get to know him so well and he knows you so well . You can be sort of in love with your husband but not madly in love with him . BOBBY Then I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love . FLORRIE SANDS No doubt you wish Rims had gone to Buenos Ayres . BOBBY No . FLORRIE SANDS Well , he 's yours , my dear , and he was the one you wanted , so why worry about it ? BOBBY I know it ca n't go on the way it is . He 'll leave me or I 'll leave him  --  or something will happen . We want to be together and then as soon as we are together ,  --  it 's no use . She risesWe always say the wrong things  --  FLORRIE SANDS Then , do you know what I think ? p. 67 BOBBY No . FLORRIE SANDS I think it 's time for you to begin having a baby . BOBBY But if we do n't get along together now  --  FLORRIE SANDS It makes everything different . It makes you so much more important , do n't you see ? BOBBY I do n't want to be important . FLORRIE SANDS You want to be important to Rims , do n't you ? BOBBY Yes . FLORRIE SANDS Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important thing in the world to him . Men are funny that way . They take so much credit and they feel so responsible , it 's pathetic . So long as you do n't have a baby Rims is really free , you see  --  and he might get tired of you  --  but just you tie him down with two or three good fat ones  --  and he 'll stay . Willy used to get rebellious , but not any more . Not since the baby . BOBBY But that 's terrible . FLORRIE SANDS What is BOBBY To keep a man that way . FLORRIE SANDS It 's been going on a long time , my dear . I was n't the first to think of it . p. 68 BOBBY You mean that 's why women have children ? FLORRIE SANDS Why , surely . BOBBY But they want to have them . FLORRIE SANDS Oh , yes . I suppose , partly they want to keep their husbands because they want to have children , and partly they want to have children because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BOBBY It would n't  --  with us . FLORRIE SANDS You 're just like the rest of us . It 's a scientific fact . It works . Some morning you 'll tell Rims it 's going to happen , and all of a sudden everything will change . He 'll bring you things and mother you , and smother you with kisses , and he 'll be humble and happy and  --  well , you see , there 's no arguing about a thing like that  --  BOBBY Oh , but I could n't let it happen without telling him first . FLORRIE SANDS Why not ? BOBBY He might not like it . FLORRIE SANDS He 'll like it after it happens . BOBBY But I could n't . It would n't be honest . FLORRIE SANDS Of course , he must n't ever know it was n't an accident . p. 69 BOBBY We 'd have to talk about it . FLORRIE SANDS Really . BOBBY Yes . FLORRIE SANDS Well , he 'd say no , and that would be the end of that . BOBBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you did it  --  in a special way . BOBBY Is it another scheme ? FLORRIE SANDS Scheme ? BOBBY Like the  --  the questions on the pad ? FLORRIE SANDS Well , did n't that one work out ? BOBBY Yes , only I wish I 'd never done it . I wish it had happened some other way . FLORRIE SANDS It could n't have and you know it . Wait till some time when he 's just crazy about you  --  you know  --  and then say  --  BOBBY Do n't say it , please ! FLORRIE SANDS If you think he 'd see through it , dear , you 're wrong . It 's appalling what they never see through . BOBBY Oh , I wish we had n't talked about it ! FLORRIE SANDS Well , it may not be necessary yet . But any time you 're really afraid of losing him , I 'd say  --  The door bell rings . BOBBY goes into the living room to answer it. p. 70 FLORRIE SANDS Well , I 've got to go anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BOBBY Still outsideOh , hello , Dad ! I could n't think who it would be  --  Where 's mother ? FLORRIE rises , finds on the floor the paper RIMS dropped from his pocket , and reads it . MR . HALEVY OutsideShe was tired . She went to bed early . BOBBY OutsideCome on out . Florrie 's here . MR . HALEVY EnteringHello , Florrie . BOBBY enters behind him . FLORRIE SANDS Hello , grandfather . MR . HALEVY Shut up that grandfather stuff ! FLORRIE SANDS In her sweetest baby talkWhy , you precious old dear , are you ashamed of being a grandfather ? MR . HALEVY Wait till you 're a grandmother , and you 'll know how I feel . If there 's anything more humiliating than having squalling children it 's having squalling grand-children. p. 71 FLORRIE SANDS But he does n't squall ! MR . HALEVY Of course not . He coos . FLORRIE SANDS He 's really a love , daddy . Imagine your never coming to see him ! Not that I mind really . Bobby , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him when he comes back . Something I found on the floor . She hands BOBBY the paper . BOBBY Laying it downThanks ,  --  I 'm sorry you have to go . FLORRIE SANDS You 'd better look at that . It 's an I. O. U. Somebody owes Rims some money . BOBBY Looking at the thingOwes Rims money ? FLORRIE SANDS Well , it 's an I. O. U. BOBBY Oh . FLORRIE SANDS Do n't let the boy gamble , dear . Well , goodbye . Why do n't you come over sometime ? We always come to see you and you never come to see us . BOBBY We will , Florrie , goodbye . FLORRIE goes . MR . HALEVY Lighting a cigarWell , kiddie , how 's things ? p. 72 BOBBY Dad , what 's an I. O. U. for ? MR . HALEVY You mean you do n't know ? BOBBY I knew people gave them  --  but how would Rims happen to have one . MR . HALEVY I 'd say he 's lucky  --  if it 's any good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he did n't have it to lend . MR . HALEVY Then he won it . BOBBY But he did n't tell me . MR . HALEVY Why should he tell you everything , child ? Do you think you own the boy just because he 's married to you ? BOBBY But it 's for twenty-seven dollars , and to think of his not saying a word about it and we 've been talking budget all evening  --  MR . HALEVY Well , ask him , ask him . BOBBY Dad  --  MR . HALEVY Yes ? BOBBY Do you think  --  ? I do n't know  --  MR . HALEVY All right  --  what 's on your mind ? BOBBY Do you think  --  I ought to have a baby ? A pause p. 73 MR . HALEVY A whisperWhat ! BOBBY Do you think I ought to have a baby ? MR . HALEVY looks at her  --  then looks away and smiles . MR . HALEVY Jesus look down ! How old are you , girlie ? BOBBY Please do n't be foolish . MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the wrong thing to say . But looking back at my beautiful wasted youth  --  why anybody should want to have a baby  --  why anybody should even want to get married  --  is more than  --  I can ever understand .  --  From me , my dear , I fear you will get nothing but ribald advice and evil counselling . I 'd better go home . BOBBY No , do n't go . This is serious ! MR . HALEVY Bobby . I married young and brought up two lovely children . I ca n't say I regret it , but there are moments , and those moments occur more frequently now that I 'm a grandfather , when it appears to me that Don Juan and Casanova chose the better part . BOBBY Yes , I suppose that 's true if you 're a man , but I 'm not . MR . HALEVY I used to wish you were . BOBBY Why ? p. 74 MR . HALEVY Now , do n't ask me to talk seriously on this topic , my dear . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty . If I said , " No , do n't have any babies , " you 'd ask me if I was sorry we had you and Florrie , and I could n't think of an adequate reply . Anyway , fathers should n't confide in their daughters . It is n't hundred percent  --  . No doubt it would be considered a kind of intellectual incest . But I can tell you lies by the yard  --  BOBBY Then you think having a baby  --  would be a mistake ? MR . HALEVY I did n't even want you to get married . BOBBY You did n't say anything  --  MR . HALEVY I came near it  --  the night you and Rims fixed it up . I was afraid it was going to happen . BOBBY Oh . MR . HALEVY Do you know how fathers feel about their daughters when they 're growing up ? BOBBY No . MR . HALEVY Well , they think  --  when they think about it  --  here I have two good-looking virtuous girls , and I 'm putting in my whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school  --  and for what ? All for the service and delight of two unknown and probably disagreeable young men . So I used to wish I had sons , because they could have a good time at any rate . And then it occurred to me there was no reason why girls should n't have a good time . p. 75 BOBBY How do you mean ? MR . HALEVY Fall in love  --  have your affair  --  and when it 's over  --  get out ! BOBBY Oh ! MR . HALEVY I told you I 'd better go home . BOBBY But why not have a love affair  --  and get married ? MR . HALEVY Marriage is no love affair , my dear . It 's little old last year 's love affair . It 's a house and bills and dishpans and family quarrels . That 's the way the system beats you . They bait the wedding with a romance and they hang a three-hundred-pound landlord around your neck and drown you in grocery bills . If I 'd talked to you that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , why have your affair , sow a few oats . Why the devil should the boys have a monopoly on wild oats ? BOBBY Yes , I see . MR . HALEVY No , I should n't say that . Marriage is fine , kiddie , it 's grand . It 's the corner stone of progress . It 's the backbone of civilization . Do n't you believe anything against it . BOBBY Please , dad . MR . HALEVY But if I had talked to you that night , I 'd have said , you 're too young to get married . You have n't had any fun yet . He has n't money enough to support you . Why should he support you ? You 're his economic equal . p. 76 BOBBY Maybe I should have gone on working . MR . HALEVY Yes , and if you had gone on working and he did n't support you , why take his name and label yourself ? I do n't see it . No , I should n't talk that way . I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MR . HALEVY Not so surely as you 'll lose him now . It used to be a love affair , did n't it ? BOBBY Yes . MR . HALEVY What is it , as is ? BOBBY Grocery bills  --  mostly . MR . HALEVY I 'm  --  I 'm sorry . BOBBY Then  --  then why did n't mother lose you ? MR . HALEVY Well , maybe she did . And maybe I lost her . Of course we stayed around . We had children . BOBBY And  --  did n't you like having children ? MR . HALEVY Now , to be honest  --  children do get you  --  they do get you . I have to admit that ,  --  and I suppose a man wants to have children  --  just to prove he 's all right . Before you have children you 're afraid something 's the matter with you  --  yes , and after you have them , you 're sure of it . But  --  you do n't go away . You see , you start one baby , just as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life sentence . PauseFor both of you . p. 77 BOBBY But  --  if you have a husband  --  and you want to keep him all your life long  --  then maybe a baby is the best thing  --  is n't it ? MR . HALEVY You scheming little devil ! BOBBY It 's true , is n't it ? MR . HALEVY Oh , yes , it 'll hold him , and you too . BOBBY You do n't understand me , dad . I 'm young and foolish  --  and Rims is everything in the world to me and I 'm afraid I 'll lose him . I ca n't help being young and foolish . The door bell rings . MR . HALEVY No , I suppose not . BOBBY So I guess I 'll make it  --  a life sentence . MR . HALEVY All right .  --  Only think it over . The bell rings again . BOBBY goes out to the door . FLORRIE SANDS OutsideHello , Bobby . It 's only us again . BOBBY Why Florrie , come in . FLORRIE SANDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a message for you . She enters , followed by BOBBY and WILLY . That is , Rims asked him to tell you he 'd be home late . p. 78 BOBBY Oh . Oh , yes . WILLY SANDS Why , you see , he got a chance to get into a little game , so he told me to tell you to look for him when you saw him coming  --  BOBBY Oh . FLORRIE SANDS Never mind , dear . They all get that way sometimes . Give him rope . WILLY SANDS Sure , give him plenty of rope . That 's always the best plan . And , by the way , Florrie , I may be out late tomorrow night . Do n't look for me  --  FLORRIE SANDS No , you do n't , darling . WILLY SANDS I thought not . FLORRIE SANDS Why , Willy , you know you always go out when you really want to  --  WILLY SANDS Well , as I often say , I would n't have known it if you had n't told me . BOBBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all right , dear . BOBBY I  --  I do n't think he likes me any more . MR . HALEVY Sure , he likes you . He 'd better like you , or I 'd horsewhip him . Upstart cub ! BOBBY Oh , no , dad , he 's  --  p. 79 MR . HALEVY I 'd like to know what he 's ever done to deserve a girl like my Bobby . BOBBY No ,  --  I 'm not good enough for him , dad  --  you do n't know him .  --  RIMS enters by the back door . MR . HALEVY I do n't have to know him . FLORRIE SANDS Why , Rims  --  Hello ! RIMS O'NEIL Crossing to the living roomHello . FLORRIE SANDS Well , can we do anything for you , Rims ? Kill a fatted calf , or something ? There is no answer . A chair falls over , and a pile of books slide to the floor . RIMS O'NEIL In living roomGod damn it ! BOBBY Going to the doorCa n't I help you ? RIMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in that closet but your overcoat  --  RIMS O'NEIL I 'm just looking for something . BOBBY All right . She re-enters and picks up the I. O. U. RIMS comes in , evidently hunting for something . Were you looking for this , Rims ? p. 80 RIMS O'NEIL Where was it ? BOBBY Why  --  RIMS O'NEIL Yeah , I know damn well where it was and so do you ! It was in my coat pocket ! BOBBY Maybe it was . I do n't know . RIMS O'NEIL I 'll bet you do n't . FLORRIE SANDS Why , Rims , darling , what a thing to say to little wifie ! RIMS O'NEIL Turning on herBaby talk ! FLORRIE SANDS And I suppose you never talk baby talk . RIMS O'NEIL No ! MR . HALEVY Turning to leaveIt was on the floor , Rims . You ought to take better care of your valuable papers . Well , Bobby , I 'll be running along . He goes . RIMS O'NEIL Oh , stay ! Spend the night ! I 'm going . FLORRIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLY SANDS Going outKeep out of it , ca n't you ? It 's none of your affair . FLORRIE SANDS Bobby , I 'll run along ! And Rims , you 're just a love , just a perfect love . She goes out. p. 81 RIMS O'NEIL Yeah , I always liked you too ! You 've got a grand family , take it all round ca n't understand why your mother was n't here well . So long . He crosses to the door , then pauses . You probably want to know where I got that I. O. U. BOBBY Looking awayNo . RIMS O'NEIL Well , I 'll tell you anyway . I got it playing blackjack . I guess I 've got a right to a game even if I am married you do n't need to look so tragic . I always played cards and I 'll do it some more . BOBBY I do n't mind anything except you said you needed money  --  and you had some . RIMS O'NEIL Sure . I know . You think you 've got a mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to write it down on a book . So you wo n't miss anything . BOBBY Why do you have to be nasty about it ? RIMS O'NEIL I 'm not being nasty . I 'm telling you a few things . You do as you please , you go to dinner with Mengle , you take back your job with him and as good as tell me if I do n't like it I can go chase myself . Well then , by God , I 'll do as I please . Anyway , I did n't get that twenty-seven free and clear . I got an I. O. U. for 27 and I gave one for 29 . I was two dollars in the hole I did n't tell you because I did n't want to I 'm not used to telling anybody everything . p. 82 BOBBY Well , do n't worry about it , dear . Run along , and have a good time  --  RIMS O'NEIL You know , I have n't got anything against you  --  only I 'm just not used to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . I 'm the earning end and you 're the paying end and we 've got to work together . Only it comes kind of hard . BOBBY It surely comes hard to me , Rims . RIMS O'NEIL Aw , I 'm not going . He throws his hat on a chair . BOBBY Why not ? Run along . Have a good time . RIMS O'NEIL How can I have a good time  --  if you do n't say goodbye to me ? BOBBY Goodbye . RIMS O'NEIL Ah , kid kiss me goodbye . She is silent . He turns again . BOBBY Rims ! He drops his hat again and she throws herself into his arms . RIMS O'NEIL You know , I think it 's that sister of yours . Every time she comes in the house , I see red . I do n't like your family . That 's the truth . BOBBY I wish I did n't have any family . I wish there was just you and me  --  p. 83 RIMS O'NEIL Everybody ought to be born orphans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you just being kind to me ? RIMS O'NEIL You know darn well I 'm crazy about you . But , hell , the way everybody goes blooey  --  BOBBY Well then I do n't care how things go . RIMS O'NEIL Holding herSweetheart ! Well , I guess I ought to be getting along , kid . The fellows are waiting for me . BOBBY Do n't  --  do n't go quite yet  --  RIMS O'NEIL All right . BOBBY Do n't you think , there must be something wrong , dear ? Or else we 'd be happier ? RIMS O'NEIL I do n't know . We 're pretty happy . BOBBY No ,  --  no , we 're not . RIMS O'NEIL Well , maybe you 're right . BOBBY Maybe  --  maybe we ought to have a baby . RIMS O'NEIL Good God , girl ! I guess we 've got trouble enough  --  you think I want to join the chain gang ? A baby ! Say , did you ever see a kid you did n't want to run from ? p. 84 BOBBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better  --  RIMS O'NEIL For the love of Mike ! Say , kid , are you  --  ? Are you ? BOBBY No ; oh , no ! RIMS O'NEIL Well , I 'm glad of that . That would  --  make it different . BOBBY Would it , dear ? RIMS O'NEIL Would it ? BOBBY Rims  --  if you knew what I wanted , more than anything else , would you let me have it ? RIMS O'NEIL I guess it  --  it would depend . BOBBY Rims , dear , when a woman 's truly in love with a man  --  and believes in him , why then what she wants most of anything  --  is to have a baby with him  --  a baby that would be just ours  --  RIMS O'NEIL Why , darling  --  gosh , kid  --  why  --  you see , we could n't afford  --  say , I did n't know you felt that way  --  but if you  --  if you do  --  BOBBY No , I ca n't do it ! I ca n't go through with it ! RIMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I mean ? I was roping you in . That 's what I mean  --  and I ca n't do it ! I was afraid I might lose you , that 's all , and I thought I could keep you if we  --  if there was a  --  p. 85 RIMS O'NEIL Oh , you were roping me in ? BOBBY Yes , but I wo n't do it . I wo n't keep you that way . If I ca n't keep you on the level , why , I 'll just have to lose you  --  RIMS O'NEIL I see . BOBBY Because  --  I love you too much  --  RIMS O'NEIL Did somebody put you up to that or did you invent it for yourself ? BOBBY No . RIMS O'NEIL No what ? BOBBY I just  --  thought of it . RIMS O'NEIL No you did n't . It 's not like you . Somebody put you up to it . BOBBY Well , forget it .  --  I 've been keeping you  --  RIMS O'NEIL FiercelyIf it was that sister of yours  --  BOBBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest with you now anyway . I 'm going to be so honest it hurts . It is n't the first time I tried to trick you . I tricked you into marrying me . RIMS O'NEIL When ? BOBBY When you asked me to marry you . Did n't you see it ? p. 86 RIMS O'NEIL No . BOBBY Well , it was obvious enough . RIMS O'NEIL Did she put you up to that too ? BOBBY It does n't matter . I did it . RIMS O'NEIL All right , I 've got her number . And yours too . It 's the last time you put anything over on me  --  BOBBY I do n't want to put anything over on you . If I 'd wanted to . I could have , could n't I ?  --  and I did n't ! RIMS O'NEIL Listen , kid  --  I think we 're going to have a show-down right here and now ! A fellow gives up a lot when he gets married . As long as he 's single , he owns the earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , his time 's not his own , he 's got to keep on working whether he wants to or not , and there 's hell to pay if he spends an extra dime . Whenever I tired of my job I used to quit  --  if I did n't like one town I tried another  --  and now I ca n't  --  BOBBY Why not ? RIMS O'NEIL Because I 've got a wife  --  because I 've got a family ? BOBBY Good God  --  am I a family ? I wo n't be a wife  --  I wo n't be a family ! I 'm just me ! p. 87 RIMS O'NEIL All right , be yourself ! BOBBY All right , I 'll be myself  --  and if you think a man gives up a lot when he gets married , a girl gives up something when she gets married , and do n't you forget it ! I spend the whole day here taking care of this damned house for you and cooking your meals and washing your dishes and never going anywhere because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dime for myself I have to ask for it ! It 's degrading ! RIMS O'NEIL It 's your own home . BOBBY It 's not mine . It 's all yours . You earn the money so it 's all yours ! I tell you it 's despicable ! Asking ! RIMS O'NEIL Throw it up to me I do n't earn enough ! That 's right ! BOBBY Well , you do n't ! RIMS O'NEIL You knew how much I was earning when you married me . If you do n't like it , why see what you can do about it ! BOBBY Oh ! Oh ! Well I know what I can do about it ! RIMS O'NEIL Well , you wo n't work for Mengle ! If it 's my house I 'm going to have my way in it , and I wo n't have my wife working for Mengle ! I give up a good deal to keep this damn place going and it 's going to be the way I want it from now on  --  p. 88 BOBBY Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the front door ! I guess I know when I 've got enough ! She goes into front room . RIMS O'NEIL Where are you going ? BOBBY stops in the arch , turns , and faces him . BOBBY ScreamingYou can wash your own dishes ! The hot water 's in the right hand tap ! I 'm running along ! And I 'm not coming back ! She storms out . RIMS O'NEIL CallingYou mean you 're leaving me ? BOBBY In the living roomIf you do n't believe it , you watch me ! RIMS O'NEIL Picking up his hat and coatAll right . Suits me . Two can play at that game . I 'm not stopping you . Got any money ? BOBBY Re-entering with her coat and hat onI 've got the rent money . RIMS O'NEIL If you go to work for Mengle I quit him ! BOBBY Picking up her pocket bookI do n't care where you work . It 's a free country . Goodbye . She goes out through the living room ; the door slams. p. 89 RIMS O'NEIL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . After a moment he comes in , shaken and humbled . Bobby ! There is no answer . He turns off the kitchen light and goes out . The light in the living room still burns . BOBBY comes back through the living room . BOBBY Rims ! Rims , dear ! No answer . She turns slowly , crosses to the living room and goes out again , switching off the light . The front door closes. @x Three weeks later . A bedroom in MRS . GORLIK 'S boarding house in East 33rd St. There is an entrance door at the left , a closet at the right . Near the closet an open window reveals a moonlit night and a fire-escape . There are a couple of ancient chairs , a dresser and an iron bed . The paper on the wall has been there  --  well , as long as the carpet on the floor . The stage is altogether dark save for the light outside the window . A breeze blows the curtains gently . There is a knock at the door . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters , switches on the lights and goes across to close the window , muttering . Never knew a girl was n't a born fool . Leaves her window up with all these robberies  --  gets all my curtains dirty  --  She inspects a pair of stockings drying on a towel rack . T'ai n't decent ! A door bell rings below . She looks at the second pair . Another pair . A VOICE From the basementMrs . Gorlik ! MRS . GORLIK What do you want ? VOICE From basementMan on his way up to see Miss Halevy. p. 91 MRS .

HALEVY EnteringThat 's all right , I 'll just wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MRS . GORLIK You mean you 'll wait here ? MR . HALEVY Well not necessarily here  --  if you 'd rather I waited somewhere else . MRS . GORLIK I do n't know when she 's coming back , and I do n't know as you 'd better wait . MR . HALEVY What 's that ? MRS . GORLIK I said , I do n't know as you 'd better wait . MR . HALEVY Well you see I always decide these matters for myself , my dear Miss  --  p. 92 MRS . GORLIK PositiveMrs . Gorlik . MR . HALEVY Yes . Well you see , Mrs. Gorlik , I 'm Miss Halevy 's father . Now , if you 'd rather I waited in the parlor  --  MRS . GORLIK There ai n't any parlor .

HALEVY Bobby coming in soon ? RIMS O'NEIL I do n't know . MR . HALEVY Because if she is I 'll run along . I did n't know you two 'd got together . RIMS O'NEIL Me ? I have n't seen her . MR . HALEVY Oh , I see . RIMS O'NEIL Yeah . I came in on the chance she might be here . MR . HALEVY So did I. RIMS O'NEIL You know when I first came in , I thought you were Mengle . MR . HALEVY Well , how is Mengle for looks ? RIMS O'NEIL I 'm no judge . I hate the face off him . MR . HALEVY What made you think he might be here ? RIMS O'NEIL That 's all right . MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ? MR . HALEVY Or , maybe I under-estimate you . What made you think Mengle might be here ?  --  RIMS does n't answer . All right ! RIMS O'NEIL RisingListen , do you think I 've been having an easy time these last three weeks ? p. 95 MR . HALEVY I do n't know . RIMS O'NEIL Maybe you think I 've been having the time of my life . My wife 's left me . Now 's my chance to step out , I suppose  --  why not ? She does . MR . HALEVY That 's funny ! RIMS O'NEIL Yeah ! MR . HALEVY Because if there was any one thing in the world she wanted it was you . RIMS O'NEIL How do you know ? MR . HALEVY I know . RIMS O'NEIL Listen , Mr. Halevy . I called her up . She said I ca n't see her . Then I tried having some fun , but it was n't any good . I do n't want to play cards . I do n't want anything else in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't need me . She 's having a good time . MR . HALEVY You 'll have to prove that to me . RIMS O'NEIL Prove it ! I hung around the office last night . I had to see her . And what happened ? She comes out with Mengle  --  and they went to dinner together  --  Jeez  --  MR . HALEVY Well  --  ? RIMS O'NEIL Well  --  She did n't see me . So I followed them . And after dinner she let him bring her home . He brought her here in a private car  --  with a chauffeur . I guess that 's what she wants . I do n't earn enough . She 's got to have a private car  --  with a chauffeur. p. 96 MR . HALEVY Oh , no  --  no  --  no . RIMS O'NEIL Well , anyway , I waited outside . And pretty soon he went away . God , I do n't know what 's the matter with me . I used to have a little sense . About girls , anyway . Now I act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like ! MR . HALEVY Do n't I ? RIMS O'NEIL Does everybody go crazy this way ? MR . HALEVY Lighting his pipeEvery last one of us . RIMS O'NEIL You know , when I came in and thought Mengle was here , I was going to beat him up . MR . HALEVY No , no  --  that would n't do any good , you know . RIMS O'NEIL No . But it 'd be a lot of fun . MR . HALEVY You 're lucky , Rims . You young fellows do n't know how lucky you are . When a man 's young he makes love  --  when he 's middle-aged he makes money  --  or tries to  --  and when he 's old he makes his soul . I never could make any money to speak of , so I suppose it 's about time I began to make my soul . But I 'd rather be young  --  and make love to a girl that was in love with me . There 's nothing like it . RIMS O'NEIL She 's not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell of it . If she were , she would n't have gone away . p. 97 MR . HALEVY Well , you went away , too , did n't you ? And you were in love with her ? RIMS O'NEIL Yeah . But  --  MR . HALEVY Maybe she left you because she was in love with you . RIMS , more or less taken aback at this idea , pauses for a moment , then reaches for his hat . Where are you going , Rims ? RIMS O'NEIL I 'm going to take a walk around the block . He starts to the door and meets a chauffeur who is carrying a package . THE CHAUFFEUR I 've got a package for Miss Halevy . RIMS O'NEIL You mean Mrs. O'Neil . She 's not here . THE CHAUFFEUR They said the second floor . RIMS O'NEIL Yes , this is her room , but she 's not here . Anything I can do for you ? THE CHAUFFEUR No . This thing 's got to be delivered personally . RIMS O'NEIL Then I guess you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'NEIL Yeah ! THE CHAUFFEUR He disappearsAll right ! p. 98 RIMS O'NEIL Now what the hell is going on ? MR . HALEVY What do you think ? RIMS O'NEIL Well , that 's Mengle 's chauffeur , is n't it ? Must deliver to her personally . What the hell does that make me ? He starts to go . MR . HALEVY Wait a minute ! Shall I tell her you were here ? RIMS O'NEIL No ! He goes , bumping into MRS . GORLIK . She holds the door open . MRS . GORLIK You 'll have to leave the door open , young man . She follows him down the hall and calls . Matty ! THE VOICE Yes Ma'am ! MR . HALEVY puffs vigorously on pipe MRS . GORLIK OutsideSee that that door is closed after that young man leaves . All the draughts in these halls is  --  MRS . GORLIK enters leftYou 'll have to leave the door open with gentlemen call  --  Seeing that BOBBY is not thereOh , she ai n't come in yet ? MR . HALEVY Hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man did n't wait ? MR . HALEVY No ! MRS . GORLIK You 'll have to excuse me opening the door . It 's not one of the things I like to do  --  going around opening girls ' doors with gentlemen calling , Mr. Halevy . It is Mr. Halevy , ai n't it ? MR . HALEVY It is . MRS . GORLIK But I have to do it , much as I do n't like to . Noticing he has sat down she does the same on edge of bed . If I was ever going into this business again , I would n't take girls , only gentlemen . True , gentlemen do get drunk and smash things . But I will say this for them . They do know how to take care of themselves , and you do n't have to watch them . MR . HALEVY Why do you have to watch the girls ? MRS . GORLIK Turning to him , breathlessWhy , my dear Mr.  --  Well  --  if you knew the kind of goings on , and what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  well , you would n't want it said about your daughter . MR . HALEVY You mean they get drunk and break things ? The door-bell rings. p. 100 MRS . GORLIK I guess you know what I mean , all right . THE VOICE Mrs. Gorlik  --  MRS . GORLIK RisingWell what is it ? THE VOICE There 's a special delivery letter . MRS . GORLIK Well , sign for it . Oh , never mind , I 'm coming right down . MR . HALEVY resumes his pipe . BOBBY OutsideHello , Mrs. Gorlik . MRS . GORLIK OutsideHow do you do ? There 's a gentleman to see you that says he 's your father . BOBBY enters . MR . HALEVY rises . BOBBY Kissing himDad ! Hello ! MR . HALEVY Well , darling , I stayed away as long as I could . BOBBY Closing the door I 'm glad you came . Do you like my place ? MR . HALEVY It certainly looks familiar . BOBBY You do n't mean it looks like home ? MR . HALEVY No . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was married . They have n't changed the carpet on the stairs of any one of them . p. 101 BOBBY It must be different , though . MR . HALEVY My dear , there 's nothing new about these places except the girls and boys that live in them  --  But , I 'm certainly not crazy about this . BOBBY Well , I 'm not either . But they wo n't take girls many places and I liked their scale of prices . She hangs up her coat . MR . HALEVY You know , I walked past that little house of yours this afternoon , and it looked pretty lonely . And I felt pretty lonely , and I thought three weeks of this was about enough . So I decided to come over and ask you what about it . BOBBY Well , I wanted to be alone , and I have been . MR . HALEVY You know , you could have your old room  --  at home  --  any time ? BOBBY Dad , I 'll never go home . It would be like going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I started . MR . HALEVY I 'm afraid it was partly my fault . BOBBY No . I did it all with my little hatchet . I can not tell a lie . I 've gone back to work , dad  --  and I 'm living here . MR . HALEVY What about poor Rims ? p. 102 BOBBY What about poor me ? I had to be alone , dad ! I did n't dare see Rims . If I had I might have gone back to him  --  and then  --  well , we 'd be right back where we were . A knock at the door , BOBBY opens it . RIMS O'NEIL EnteringHello ! BOBBY Hello , Rims ! MR . HALEVY Good evening . RIMS O'NEIL Good evening , sir . MR . HALEVY Do n't you sir me , young man . I 'm only twice your age and I do n't look that . And boy , do you want to meet a nice girl ? My daughter , Mr. O'Neil . A working girl , but she has class . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes out . RIMS O'NEIL I guess you did n't want me to find you . BOBBY Oh , I do n't mind . RIMS O'NEIL Well , I 'll tell you about that first , so you 'll know how it happened . I did n't ask anybody where your room was . I followed you home last night . BOBBY Followed me ? I had dinner with Mengle . RIMS O'NEIL I know you did . Christ , kid , I 've been out of my head . I hung around the office last night to see you , and who did you come out with ? p. 103 BOBBY You waited  --  at the office ? RIMS O'NEIL Yes  --  BOBBY I did n't see you ! RIMS O'NEIL And then he came home with you . He even stayed around a while . BOBBY I was just lonely . RIMS O'NEIL You did n't look very lonely to me . I ca n't stand that . After all , you are my wife . BOBBY Oh , was that why you came ? RIMS O'NEIL No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You managed to make it lovely for me ! BOBBY Did you come to see me or did you come to lecture me about Mengle ? RIMS O'NEIL Well  --  you had dinner with him , did n't you ? BOBBY It was just Mengle , was n't it ? That was all you wanted to see me about ? RIMS O'NEIL No , it was n't . BOBBY Then  --  what was it ? RIMS O'NEIL Oh , I guess it does not matter . BOBBY That 's what does matter . RIMS O'NEIL Yeah ? p. 104 BOBBY Do n't you think so ? RIMS O'NEIL I do n't know . BOBBY Sitting down You might  --  have a chair . RIMS O'NEIL He sitsThanks . BOBBY You have a new job I hear .

BOBBY Yes  --  RIMS O'NEIL You 'd be surprised . Same salary . p. 105 BOBBY Truly ? RIMS O'NEIL Yes . BOBBY Why that 's marvellous , Rims  --  to change jobs and get the same salary the first thing . It is  --  marvellous . RIMS O'NEIL Not a very nice place , is it ? BOBBY It 's inexpensive . RIMS O'NEIL It ought to be . BOBBY You do n't like it ? RIMS O'NEIL Well , you 're here , of course . BOBBY Thanks , Rims . RIMS O'NEIL RisingSay , Bobby  --  BOBBY Rising , and putting the chair between themYes  --  ? RIMS O'NEIL Are you really as hard-hearted as  --  as all this kind of implies ? BOBBY When was I ever hard-hearted ? RIMS O'NEIL You know , I came over here all primed to say something , and I 'm damned if I know how to say it . BOBBY What was it ? RIMS O'NEIL I came to ask you  --  if you had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home now  --  p. 106 BOBBY Back to the house ? RIMS O'NEIL Where else ? BOBBY No .

RIMS O'NEIL And what am I going to do ? BOBBY I do n't know . There is a knockCome in . She opens the door and finds the chauffeur with his package . THE CHAUFFEUR I 've a package for you , Miss Halevy . BOBBY Oh ! thank you . She takes it . THE CHAUFFEUR You 're welcome ! He goes . BOBBY closes the door . RIMS O'NEIL So , it 's flowers Mengle 's sending you , huh ? Well , you better open it . BOBBY I do n't want to . RIMS O'NEIL Sure , open it . Why ruin the flowers  --  just on my account . p. 107 BOBBY It is n't flowers ! RIMS O'NEIL Then what is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RIMS O'NEIL It 's a bolt !  --  BOBBY LaughingYes  --  for the door ! RIMS O'NEIL Taking out a screw driver and a hammerAnd a hammer , and a screw driver to put it on with . BOBBY Well  --  he said he was going to send me a bolt  --  but I thought he was joking . You see , when Mengle was here last night , the landlady seemed to think he was a shady character and kept opening the door all the time  --  RIMS O'NEIL Hey ! Wait a minute ! Let me get this straight ! BOBBY I suppose he thought it would be funny . And I really did want a bolt . RIMS O'NEIL Yeah , go right ahead and explain . You 're making it better all the time . BOBBY Rims  --  RIMS O'NEIL Yeah , explain some more ! Did you ask him for it ? BOBBY I did n't tell him he could n't send it . p. 108 RIMS O'NEIL Oh , you did n't ? Well , all right  --  BOBBY You mean you think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bolt for my door ? RIMS O'NEIL I mean it looks damned funny to me , and it is damned funny ! BOBBY Certainly it 's funny ! That 's why he did it ? Do n't you see ? RIMS O'NEIL Do I see ? I 'll say I see ! He starts for the door . BOBBY Stepping in front of himRims , if you go now , it 's the last you see of me as long as you live . There is a pause . RIMS O'NEIL Well , what I ca n't understand is why you 'd let Mengle come to your room . BOBBY Well , why not , if I feel like it ? It 's my room . I can take care of myself . RIMS O'NEIL I doubt it . BOBBY Listen , Rims . I did want you to come . I 've been waiting for you to come . But if you 're going to begin to tell me what I can do and what I ca n't do  --  RIMS O'NEIL If you do n't know enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large . p. 109 BOBBY That 's just the point . I do know enough to keep clear of Mengle . Only I 'm on my own now , and I 'm going to use my own judgment . RIMS O'NEIL Such as it is . BOBBY Exactly . Such as it is . You use yours such as it is , and you have n't any guardian . RIMS O'NEIL What 's the idea , anyway . BOBBY The idea is , I 'm a free agent . Just as free as you are . RIMS O'NEIL You do n't care about me any more ? BOBBY Yes , I do . RIMS O'NEIL Well , it 's all right about Mengle . I can see how it was . BOBBY It did look queer , I know . RIMS O'NEIL Only any time you want a bolt on your door , I wish you 'd ask me . BOBBY I will  --  if you 're around . RIMS O'NEIL You know damn well I 'd be around if I thought you wanted me . BOBBY SmilingWell , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOBBYListen , dear  --  about that house ! That is n't a bad little house  --  as houses go . p. 110 BOBBY Any house is bad enough . RIMS O'NEIL PleadingYou wo n't try it again ? BOBBY No . You see  --  Oh , I wonder if I can tell you  --  What we wanted was a love affair , was n't it ? Just to be together and let the rest go hang  --  and what we got was a house and bills and general hell . Do you know what I think a love affair is , Rims ? It 's when the whole world is trying to keep two people apart  --  and they insist on being together . And when they get married the whole world pushes them together so they just naturally fly apart . I want my love affair back . I wanted hurried kisses and clandestine meetings , and a secret lover . I do n't want a house . I do n't want a husband . I want a lover . RIMS O'NEIL So that let 's me out . BOBBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens and MRS . GORLIK appears MRS . GORLIK You 'll have to leave the door open with gentlemen callers . BOBBY Oh , yes , Rims . I forgot to tell you . The door should be open . MRS . GORLIK Of course , I understand the gentleman last night was your boss , and the old one was your father and I daresay this one 's your husband . p. 111 BOBBY No . Oh , no . MRS . GORLIK IcilyThen the door stays open . BOBBY Very well . MRS . GORLIK It 's ten o'clock and I suppose you know there 's no gentlemen callers allowed after ten . BOBBY Mr. O'Neil was just going . MRS . GORLIK Yes , the gentlemen are always just going !  --  It 's ten o'clock ! She goes . BOBBY I guess you 'll have to go , Rims . RIMS O'NEIL Taking his hatAll right . BOBBY Goodnight , dear . RIMS O'NEIL So we 're not married any more ? BOBBY No . RIMS O'NEIL That 's nice . BOBBY It is , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOBBY Whenever you like . RIMS O'NEIL And how do I see you ? By appointment ? BOBBY I 'm not very busy  --  if we never had been married and I was just a girl you wanted to see sometime  --  how would you manage it ? p. 112 RIMS O'NEIL I could call you up tomorrow and take you for a bus-ride , I suppose . And dinner at Child 's . Would n't that be grand ? BOBBY I 'd like it . Why do n't you ? RIMS O'NEIL Well , I do n't want to go bus-riding  --  Aw Bobby , what 's it all leading up to anyway . Are we going to get a divorce ? BOBBY If you like . RIMS O'NEIL Will you marry me again if we do ? BOBBY Oh , Rims , you are a darling ! You are ! Would you really do it all over again ? RIMS O'NEIL Sure I would . BOBBY But you never really wanted to get married , did you ? Now tell the truth  --  RIMS O'NEIL I wanted you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a house . I wanted you but I did n't want a house . And I do n't now . RIMS O'NEIL How do I know you wo n't fall for somebody else sometime ? If I leave you here ? BOBBY You do n't . RIMS O'NEIL Oh . BOBBY How do I know you wo n't fall for somebody else ? I do n't . I do n't want to . You are n't to see me unless you just ca n't keep away . You used to know me so well you did n't like me . You used to know where I was and what I was doing all the time . It was positively indecent , and we wo n't have any more of it . It 's like not wearing any clothes . p. 113 RIMS O'NEIL Well . All right . BOBBY So  --  now we 're really free . RIMS O'NEIL I said all right . I do n't give a whoop about that . BOBBY What do you give a whoop about ? RIMS O'NEIL Close to herAbout you , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you see I ca n't get along without you ? I ca n't stand being away from you all the time . I keep waking up in the night wanting you . BOBBY So do I. RIMS O'NEIL I want to see you to-night . Page no 164 and 165 missing RIMS O'NEIL Pointing to the screw driver on chairBring me the screw driver , will you , dear ? BOBBY Bringing it to himHush ! RIMS starts to fit the bolt to the door.
