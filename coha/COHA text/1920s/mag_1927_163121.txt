Old San Francisco ( Dolores Costello ) . With her proud father she dwells on the sunny , ivy-grown rancho of the Vasquez family , who founded San Francisco . There she might have breathed rose-laden zephyrs and married Terrence O'Shaughnessy ( Charles Mack ) but for Buckwell ( Warner Oland ) , villainous politician . He wants to take away her rancho . Because she senses that , despite appearances , this wretch is a Mongolian , he carries her off to the most devilish abyss in old Chinatown , " the inner circle of the mile of hell . " There , on the point of worse than death , it occurs to her to repeat the Lord 's Prayer . In answer , God sends the earthquake of 1906 to demolish the villain . <P> The eccentricities of the bad man are noteworthy . He worships weird , heathen deities while masquerading as a Caucasian Christian . He knows secret trap doors , cells , torture chambers , depraved henchmen . He keeps a dwarf brother locked up in a stifling cage . In short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more astonishing than the cinema version of virtue , it is its conception of vice . <P> Alias the Deacon ( Jean Hersholt ) . As in the play of the same name , the hero 's occupation is fleecing the wicked rich to invest the righteous poor . An angel-faced cardsharp , he blandly deals his opponents four nines , a flush , a straight , a full house , only to stagger the crowd by slapping down a royal straight flush for his own account , thus taking the largest poker pot ever staked in that town . With the proceeds he raises a mortgage , facilitates a wedding , stores up treasure in Heaven . Then he ambles into a box car and shuffles off to other good crookedness . Jean Hersholt makes him an engaging bum . <P> Madame Wants No Children is a German treatment of a French foible . That it bubbles without fuming is gratifying to audiences who are waiting to see Herr Alexander Korda ( director ) and Frau Marie Corda ( actress ) * in a forthcoming screen version of The Private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wants No Children is a newlywed French wife whom the bleak sphinx , Venetian gondolas and an uxorious spouse can not dislodge from night clubs .

Eventually , however , she joggles down to productive domesticity , mindful that when Baby does arrive , she will have her own night club . <P> Ritzy ( Betty Bronson ) . Elinor Glyn , with whom the public mind associates The Philosophy of Love and the theory of IT , + here takes hold of an unusually refreshing bit of froth , only to flatten it with her usual pomposity . The heroine , a little Miss Main Street , is infatuated with the-idea of marrying a duke . Only after she has been taught the error of her snobbish ways and given an opportunity to register truly philosophic passion under half-closed eyelids , does she discover that her fianc , Mr. Smith , is in reality the Duke of Westborough . Thereupon , morality and the sugar plum go down together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While making love in a rowboat that bobs on the edge of a fall , fighting duels for the Marquis de Daddo , and engaging in picturesque stunts that have little plot cohesion , Raymond Griffith manages to appear nonchalantly amusing .
