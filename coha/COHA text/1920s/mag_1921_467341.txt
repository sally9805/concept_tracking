Much of the material making up this article was written by Mr. Burroughs in the summer of 1920 , at Woodchuck Lodge , his midsummer home near Roxbury in the Catskills . Last January , while at La Jolla , California , he worked on it from time to time , interrupted by short illnesses ? the last work being done in a little cabin in Pasadena Glen , a few days before the development of his final illness . At that time he selected the title and attempted to arrange the vcrious headings , but felt unequal to the task . It is significant that his last published utterance shows his abiding interest in ? Nature ? no phase is unimportant to him ; tirelessly he observes , explores , speculates . He chides her for her inconsistencies and her haphazard methods , laments her waste and indifference and cruelty , yet sees that amid all her waywardness , even her seeming malevolence , " her definite ends are inclosed in universal ends . " In truth , he accepts the universe as it is The philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sublime line from his poem , " Wailing , " ? " I stand amid the eternal ways , " ? he held consistently , even to the hour of facing the Mystery. ? CLARA . BARRus . As I saunter through the fields and woods I discover new acts in Nature 's drama . They are , however , the old acts , played again and again , which have hitherto escaped my notice , so absorbed have I been in the rise and fall of the curtain , and in the entrances and exits of the more familiar players . I count myself fortunate if , during each season , I detect a few new acts on the vast stage ; and as long as I live I expect to cogitate and speculate on the old acts , and keep up my interest in the whole performance . SUNRISE The most impressive moment of the day here in the Catskills is the rising of the sun . From my cot on the porch I see the first flash of his coming . Before that I see his rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mane to the mountain crest . The dawn comes very gently . I am usually watching for it . As I gaze I gradually become conscious of a faint luminousness in the eastern sky . This slowly increases and changes to a deep saffron , and then in eight or ten minutes that fades into a light , bluish tinge ? the gold turns tosilver . After some minutes the sky , just at the point where the sun is to appear , begins to glow again , as if the silver were getting warm ; a minute or two more and the brow of the great god is above the horizon line . His mere brow , as I try to fix my eye upon it , fairly smites me blind . The brow is magnified by the eye into the whole face . One realizes in these few seconds how rapidly the old earth turns on its axis . You witness the miracle of the transition of the dawn into day . The day is born in a twinkling . Is it Browning who uses the word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boils at last . " Gilder , I think , speaks of it as a scimitar flashing on the brim of the world . At any rate , I watch for it each morning as if I were seeing it for the first time . It is the critical moment of the day . You actually see the earth turning . Later in the day one does not note in the same way the sun climbing the heavens . The setting sun does not impress one , because he is usually enveloped in vapors . His day 's work is done and he goes to his rest veiled and subdued . He is new in the morning and old at his going down . His gilding of the clouds at sunset is a token of a fair day on the morrow ; his touching them with fire in the morning is a token of wind or storm . So much we make of these things , yet the sun knows them not . They are local and only earth phenomena , yet the benefaction of the sun is as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this were the case , and yet the fraction of his light and heat that actually falls upon this mote of a world adrift in sidereal space is so infinitely small that it could hardly be computed by numbers . In our religion we appropriate God to ourselves in the same way , but He knows us not in this private and particular way , though we are all sharers in the Universal Beneficence . SPENDTHRIFT NATURE Emerson says , " Nature is a spendthrift , but takes the shortest way to her ends . " She is like ourselves , she is ourselves written large ? written in animal , in tree , in fruit , in flower . She is lavish of that of which she has the most . She is lavish of her leaves , but less so of her flowers , still less of her fruit , and less yet of her germinal parts . The production of seed is a costly process to the plant . Many trees yield fruit only every other year . I say that Nature is a spendthrift only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pollen from the blooming pines and from the grasses in the meadow . She is more parsimonious with her winged seeds , such as the maple and the elm , than with her heavy nuts ? butternuts , hickory nuts , acorns , beechnuts , and so on . All these depend upon the agency of the birds and squirrels to scatter them . She offers them the wage of the sweet kernel , and knows that they will scatter more than they eat . To all creatures that will sow the seeds of her berries she offers the delectable pulp . " Do this chore for me , and you will find the service its own reward . " All the wild fruits of the fields and woods hold seeds that must be distributed by animal agency . Even the fiery Arum , or Indian turnip , tempts some birds to feast upon its red berries , and this scatters the undigested seeds . The mice and the squirrels doubtless give them a wide berth , but in the crop of the bird the seeds have the sting taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with strychnine . We ourselves are covetous of those things of which we have but few , extravagant with those of which we have an abundance . When the Western farmer burns corn in place of coal , be assured he sees his own account in it . We husband our white pine , and are free with our hemlock ; we are stingy with our hickory , and openhanded with our beech and chestnut . COSMIC RHYTHMS The swells that heat upon the shores of the ocean are not merely the result of a local agitation of the waters . The pulse of the earth is in them . The pulse of the sun and the moon is in them . They are more cosmic than terrestrial . The earth wears her seas like a loose garment which the sun and moon con-stantly pluck at and shift from side to side . Only the ocean feels the tidal impulse , the heavenly influences . The great inland bodies of water are unre-sponsive to them ? they are too small for the meshes of the solar and lunar net . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the great funda-mental questions of life ? What a puzzle the tides must have been to early man ! What proof they afford of the cosmic forces that play upon us at all times and hold us in their net ! Without the proof they afford , we should not know how we are tied to the solar system . The lazy , reluctant waters ? how they follow the sun and moon , " with fluid step , " as Whitman says , " round the world " ! The land feels the pull also and would follow if it could . But the mobile clouds go their way , and the aerial ocean makes no sign . The pull of the sun and the moon is upon you and me also , but we are all unconscious of it . We are bodies too slight to affect the beam of the huge scale . , THE BEGINNINGS OF LIFE It is remarkable , I think , that Professor Osborne , in his Origin and Evolution of Life , would make no account of the micro-organisms or unicellular lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambrian rocks , and that have survived unchanged even to our times . I saw in the Grand Carton of the Colorado where they were laid down horizontally on the old Azoic or original rocks , as if by the hand of a mason building the foundation of a superstructure . All the vast series of limestone rocks are made up from the skeletons of minute living bodies . Other strata of rocks are made up of the skeletons of diatoms . Some of our polishing powders are made from these rocks . Formed of pure silex , these rocks are made up of the skeletons of organisms of many exquisite forms , Forominiferce . The Pyramids are said to be built of rocks formed by these organisms . " No single group of the animal kingdom , " says Mr. W. B. Carpenter , " has contributed , or is at present contributing , so largely as has the Foramiaiferce to the formation of the earth 's : rust . " In the face of these facts , how insatisfactory seem Professor Osborne 's statements that life probably originated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soils , in the fresh vaters of continental pools , or in the ; lightly saline waters of the " bordering m-imordial seas . " This last suggestion ? omes nearer the mark . There is no - ariation during geologic time of these n-imordial living organisms . All con ? ivable change of environment have ? assed over them , but they change not . 3acteria struggle together , one form de ? ouring another form . Unicellular life Ong precedes multicellular . Biologists tsually begin with the latter ; the former fixed ; with the latter begins developpment or evolution , and the peopling of he world with myriads of animal forms . NATURE 'S METHODS Nature baffles us by methods so unke our own . Man improves upon his Von . CXLIII. ? No. 855. - 45inventions ; lie makes them better and better and discards the old . The first airplane flew a few miles with its pilot ; now the airplane flies hundreds of miles and carries tons of weight . Nature has progressed steadily from lower to higher forms , but she keeps all her lower forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the perfected models . There is no vacancy at the bottom of her series , as there is in the case of man . I am aware that we falsify her methods in contrasting them with those of man in any respect . She has no method , in our sense of the term . She is action , and not thought ; growth and not construction ; is internal and not external . To try to explain her in terms of our own methods is like trying to describe the sphere in terms of angles and right lines . The origin of species is as dark a problem as is the origin of the secondary rocks . What factors or forces entered into the production of the vast variety of stratified rocks , differing as widely from the original Adam-rock , the granite , as the races of men differ from one another ? There is just as much room for natural selection to work in one case as in the other . We find where two kinds of rock touch , one overlying the other , an absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . How account for their juxtaposition ? Rock begat rock , undoubtedly , and the aerial forces played the chief part , but the origin of each kind is hidden in the abyss of geologic time , as is that of the animal species . The position of the camel with reference to the giraffein Africa is analogous to that , say , of the Catskill conglomerate to the laminated sandstone that lies beneath it . They are kindred ; one graduates into the other . Whence the long neck and high withers of the giraffe ? The need of high feeding , say the selectionists ; but other browsing animals must have felt the same need . Our moose is strictly a browsing animal , and , while his neck and shoulders are high , and his lips long , they do not approach those of the giraffe . The ostrich has a long neck also , but it is a low feeder , mainly from the ground . I had a letter the other day from a man who wanted to know why the meadow or field mice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep coverlid of snow upon the ground . Is it , he asks , because they find it difficult to get tip through the deep frozen snow to the surface to secure seeds to eat ? He does not seem to know that meadow mice are not seed eaters , but that they live on grass and roots and keep well hidden beneath the ground during the day . But when there is a deep fall of snow they come lip out of their retreats and lead a free holiday life beneath the snow , free from the danger of cats , foxes , owls , and hawks . Life becomes a sort of picnic with them . They build new nests on the surface of the ground , and form new runways , and disport themselves apparently in a festive mood . The snow is their protection ; they bark the trees and take their time . When the snow is gone , their winter picnic is at an end , and they retreat to their dens in the ground and beneath flat stones and lead once more the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other higher forms of life surviving in. the highway of the physical forces on the ground that the wheels and tramping hoofs missed them much oftener than they hit them . They learned instinctively to avoid these destructive forces . Animal life was developed amid these dangers . The physical forces go their way as indifferent to life as is your automobile to the worms - lid beetles in the road . Pain and suffering are nothing to the Eternal ; the only thing that concerns It is the survival of the fit , no matter how many fall or are crushed by the way ; to It men are as cheap as fleas ; and they have slaughtered one another in Europe of late without help or hindrance from the Eternal , as do the tribes of hostile ants . The wars of the microbes and the wars of men are all of a piece in the total scheme of things . The survivors owe their power of survival to the forces that sought their destruction ; they are strong by what they have overcome : they graduated in that school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for us as much as it is against us . Pain and suffering are guardian angels ; they teach us what to shun . How puzzling and contradictory Nature often is ! How impossible , for instance , to reduce her use of horns to a single rule . In the deer and elk tribe the antlers seem purely secondary sexual characteristics ; they are dropped as the season wanes . But the antelopes do not drop their horns , and in Africa they are singularly ornamental . But with our common sheep the horns are sexual manifestations ; yet the old ram does not shed his horns . Nature will not be consistent . The moose does not shed his horns , and are not they sexual signs also ? the badge of the male ? Back in geologic time we had a ruminant with four horns ? two on the nose and two on the crown , and they were real , permanent , bony growths . What a powerful right forelimb nature has given to the shovel-footed mole , while the chipmunk , who also burrows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in building his mound of earth ; he is compelled to use his soft , tender lath nose as a pusher . When the soil vs-hicl. his feet have loosened has accumulate ( at the entrance to his hole , he shoves ii back with his nose . Here are two species of our wild rnici ? the white-footed mouse , and the long tailed , jumping or kangaroo mouse The former is active the year through the latter hibernates in winter , and the saves a lot of worry and exposure search of food . The woodchuck eats an basks all summer and sleeps all wintei while its brother rodent , the porcupine is actively feeding on the bark of son tree all winter . Even to some of her thistles Nature partial . The Canada thistle sows i seeds upon the wind like the commc native thistle ; then in addition it sends big root underground parallel with its surface , and just beyond the reach of the plow , which sends up shoots every six or seven inches , so that , like some other noxious weeds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both below ground an d above . A bachelor of laws in Michigan writes me in a rather peremptory manner demanding an answer by return mail as to why robins are evenly distributed over the country instead of collected in large numbers in one locality ; and if they breed in the South ; and he insists that my answer he explicit , and not the mere statement " that it is natural law . " I wonder that he did not put a specialdelivery stamp on his letter . He is probably wondering why I am so dilatory in answering . There seems to be an inherent tendency in nearly all living things to scatter , to seek new fields . They are obeying the first command ? to increase and multiply . Then it is also a question of food , which is limited in every locality . Robins do not breed in flocks , but in pairs . Every gas is a vacuum to every other gas , and every locality is a vacuum to the different species of birds that breed there . The seed eaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the omnivorous ' eeders , like the robin ? in other words , he sparrows , the flycatchers , the war ) 1ers , may and do all live together in harnony in the same narrow area . The struggle , of which we have heard o much since Darwin 's time , is mainly a tatural sifting and distributing process , uch as that going on all about us by the rinds and the waters . The seeds carried .37 the winds do not thrive unless they hance to fall on suitable ground . All lay be " fit " to survive and yet fail un ! ss they are also lucky . What so frail s a spider 's web , and yet how the ) iders thrive ! Nature gives the weak ? any advantages . There is a slow , bloodless struggle of se species with another the fleet with le slow , the cunning with the stupid , to sharp-eyed and sharp-eared with thedull of eye and ear , the keen of scent : with the blunt of scent ? which we call natural competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dull-eared , and dull-scented find their place and thrive for all that . They are dull and slow because they do not need to be otherwise ; the conditions of their lives do not require speed and sharpness . The porcupine has its barbed quills , the skunk its pungent secretion . All parts of nature dovetail together . The deer and the antelope kind have speed and sharp senses because their enemies have speed and sharp senses . The small birds are keeneyed and watchful because the hawks are so , too . The red squirrel dominates the gray squirrel , which is above him in size and strength , and the chipmunk below him , but he does not exterminate either . The chipmunk burrows in the ground where the red can not follow him , and he lays up a store of nuts and seeds which the red does not . The weasel easily dominates the rat , but the rat prospers in spite of cats and traps and weasels . The sifting of species is done largely by environment , the wet , the cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their environment , survive . For some obscure reason they have a fuller measure of life than those who fall by the way . HEADS AND TAMS I have heard a story of a young artist who , after painting a picture of a horse facing a storm , was not satisfied with it , and , feeling that something was wrong , asked Landseer to look at it . Instantly the great artist said to him , " Turn the horse around . " The cow turns her head to the storm , the horse turns his tail . Why this difference ? Because each adopts the plan best suited to its needs and its anatomy . How much better suited is the broad , square head of the cow , with its heavy coating of hair and its ridge of bone that supports its horns , to face the storm than is the smooth , more nervous and sensitive head of the horse ! What a contrast between their noses and their mode of grazing ! The cow has no upper front teeth ; she reaps the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bites it of and loves to bite the turf with it . The lip of the horse is mobile and sensitive . Then the bovine animals fight with their heads , and the equine with their heels . The horse is a hard and high kicker , the cow a feeble one in comparison . The horse will kick with both hind feet , the cow with only one . In fact , there is not much " kick " in her kind . The tail of the cow is of less protection to her than is that of the horse to him . Her great need of it is to fight flies , and , if attacked in the rear , it furnishes a good hold for her enemies . Then her bony stern with its ridges and depressions and thin flanks , is less fit in any encounter with storm or with beast than is her head . On the other hand , the round , smooth , solid buttocks of the horse , with their huge masses of muscles , his smooth flanks , and his tail ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair ? are well designed to resist storm and cold . What animal is it in Job whose neck is clothed with thunder ? With the horse , it is the hips that are so clothed . His tremendous drive is in his hips . AN UNSAVORY SUBJECT If a rose by any other name would smell as sweet , I suppose the breath of the obscene fungus by any other name would smell as bad . The defensive weapon of our black-and-white wood pussy would probably not be less offensive if we called him by that name alone , instead of the common one by which he is universally known . While in Southern California last winter I heard of one that took up his abode in the basement of a house that stood on the side of a hill in the edge of the country . It was in a sort of lumber room where all sorts of odds and ends had accumulated . On some shelves was a box of miscellaneous articles , such as lids to tin cans , bed castors , old toothbrushes , bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the dried foot and leg of a hen . One morning , on opening the door of the basement , the mistress of the house was surprised to see the whole collection of trash laid out in a line across the floor . The articles were placed with a considerable degree of regularity covering a space about fifteen inches wide and ten feet in length . There were sixty-one articles in the row . Having such an unsavory creature in the basement of your house is rather ticklish business ; not so perilous as a stick of dynamite , yet fraught with unpleasant possibilities . They cleared away the exhibit and left the door open , hoping their uninvited guest would take his departure . But he did not . A few nights later he began another collection , finding a lot of new material ? among other things a box with old atomize ' bulbs , four of which he arranged here and there , in the row ? a motley array What is his object ? I confess I do nol know . No one has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is little doubi that it is his work . ' The Western skunk or civet cat , is a small creature , not mud bigger than a gray squirrel . He can hid ' behind a dustpan . I wish some one would tell me wh : this night prowler so often seems t spray the midnight air with his essence which leaves no trace by day . He neve taints his own fur with it . In the wild our Eastern species is as free from ode as a squirrel or a woodchuck . Kill c disturb one by day or night in haunts , and he leaves an odor on th ground that lasts for months . While at friend 's house in the Catskills last At gust a wood pussy came up behind ti kitchen and dug in the garbage heal We saw him from the window in tl early evening , and we smelled him . Ft some reason he betrayed his present Late that night I was awakened by wave of his pungent odor ; it fairly mac my nose smart , yet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of a wood rat ingead of a civet cat . C. B. odor could be detected anywhere about the place . Of course the smell is much more pronounced in the damp night air than by day , yet this does not seem an adequate explanation . Does he signal at night to his fellows by his odor ? He has no voice , so far as I know . I have never heard him make a vocal sound . When caught in a trap , or besieged by dogs in a stone wall , he manifests his displeasure by stamping his feet . He is the one American who does not hurry through life . I have no proof that he ever moves faster than a walk , or that , by any sign , he ever experiences the feeling of fear , so common to nearly all our smaller animals . His track upon the snow is that of a creature at peace with all the world . IALL-SEEING NATURE Sitting by a flat rock one summer morning , on my home acres in the Catsskills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the rock , the surface of which is on a level with the turf , the same as over the ground . Of course they could not take root , but they went through all the motions of taking root ; the little clusters of leaves developed at intervals , the rootlets showed their points or stood at " attention , " and the runners pushed out two or three feet over the barren surface and then seemed to hesitate like a traveler in the desert whose strength begins to fail . The first knot , or , one might say , the first encampment , was about one ' oot from the last one upon the turf , the iext one about eight inches farther in ; ; hen the distance dropped to six inches , hen to four . I think the runner finally ; ave it up and stopped reaching out . ! : ach group of leaves apparently draws is main sustenance from the one next . ehind it , and when this one fails to each the soil it loses heart and can give ttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result is that the stools benne smaller and smaller , and the dissnces between them less and less , down ie whole line . Nature 's methods are seen in the little as well as in the big , and these little purple runners of the vine pushing out in all directions show the all-round-thecircle efforts of Nature as clearly as do the revolving orbs in sidereal space . Her living impulses go out in all directions . She scatters her seeds upon the barren as well as upon fertile spots . She sends rains and dews upon the sea as well as upon the land . She knows not our parsimony nor our prudence . We say she is blind , but without eyes she is all-seeing ; only her creatures who live to particular ends , and are limited to particular spheres , have need of eyes . Nature has all time and all space and all ends . Delays and failure she knows not . If the runners of her strawberries do not reach their goal , the trouble corrects itself ; they finally stop searching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant goes out stronger and fuller on other sides . If the rains were especially designed to replenish our springs and supply our growing crops , the clouds might reasonably be expected to limit their benefactions , as do our sprinkling carts ; but the rains are older than are we and our crops , and it is we who must adjust ourselves to them , not they to us . The All-seeing , then , has no need of our specialized vision . Does the blood need eyes to find its way to the heart and lungs ? Does the wind need eyes to find the fertile spots upon which to drop its winged seeds ? It drops them upon all spots , and each kind in due time finds its proper habitat ? the highly specialized , such as those of the marsh plants , hitting their mark as surely as do others . Our two eyes serve us well because our footsteps are numbered and must go in a particular direction , but the goal of all-seeing Nature is everywhere , and she arrives before she starts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not governed . These conceptions express too little , not too much . Nature 's movements are circular ; her definite ends are inclosed in universal ends . The rains fall because the vapors rise . The rain is no more an end than is the rising vapor . Each is a part of the great circuit of beneficent and malevolent forces upon which our life ( and all life ) depends ; upon which the making of the soil of the earth and the shaping of the landscape depend ? all vegetable and animal life , all the bloom and perfume of the world , all the glory of cloud and sky , all the hazards of flood and storm , all the terror of torrents and inundations , are in this circuit of the waters from the sea to the sky , and back again through the rivers to the sea . In our geologic time there is , in this circuit of the waters , more that favors life than hinders it , else , as I so often say , we should not be here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has taken place and will continue to take place , in this beneficent circuit , is only an incident in the history of the globe ; the physical forces are neither for nor against it ; they are neutral ; life to be here at all has to run these risks ; has to run the gauntlet of these forces , and to get many a lash and gash in the running . Against the suffering and death incident thereto there is no insurance save in the wit of man himself . All this wit has been developed and sharpened by much waste and suffering . We learn to deal with difficulties through the discipline of the difficulties themselves . If man were finally to learn to control the rains and the floods it would be through the experience which they themselves bring him . The demons that destroy him are on his side when he strikes with the strength which they give him . Gravity , which so often crushes and overthrows him , is yet the source of all his might . The fire that consumes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and drives his engines across the continent . There is no god that pities us or weeps over our sufferings , save the god in our own breasts . We have life on heroic terms . Nature does not baby us nor withhold from us the bitter cup . We take our chances with all the other forms of life . Our special good fortune is that we are capable of a higher development , capable of profiting to a greater extent by experience , than are the lower forms of life . And here is the mystery that has no solution : we came out , of the burning nebulae the same as our horse and dog , but why we are men and they are still horse and dog we owe to some Power , or , shall I say , to the chance working of a multitude of powers , that are beyond our ken . That some Being willed it , designed it , no ; yel it was in some way provided for in the constitution of the world .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
