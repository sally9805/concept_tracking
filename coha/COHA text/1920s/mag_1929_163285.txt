ARMY &; NAVY <P> A hostile army , 300,000 strong , landed on the New Jersey coast near Barnegat and took the field against the U. S. Army . The invaders pushed forward to Rancocas Creek where they encountered a defensive force of 200,000 . A fierce engagement on a 40-mile front ensued . The U. S. centre was badly broken . Mt . Holly and Camp Dix fell . Trenton was bombed to bits . Philadelphia and New York lay open to attack . Then with supreme courage and vigor the U. S. forces rallied and in a fine display of open warfare threw themselves savagely upon the enemy , driving him back and back . All losses were recovered . A " lemon squeezer " movement was being applied to the invaders when an armistice ended the " war , " leaving 43,750 dead and wounded on the battlefield . <P> Such was the great battle of Rancocas Creek , staged last week as a theoretical military problem . The Red " invaders " were non-existent except for a handful of officers to outline their positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh-and-blood officers and men drawn from the regular Army , the National Guards of New York and New Jersey , the organized Reserve , all under the command of Major General Hanson Edward Ely , commander of the Second Corps Area . Except for the activities of the staff officers of 32 commands , of telegraph , telephone and typewriter operators , of motorcycle messengers , chauffeurs and carrier pigeons , all the fighting was done on large maps with little red and blue flags moved craftily about . <P> The cost of the four-day battle to the U. S. was $18,000 , most of which went to farmers for the use of their fields , barns , outhouses . Some of the husbandmen unintentionally contributed to war-time realism when they tripped over military telegraph wires strung through their hayfields , fetched axes and hacked apart the communication lines of the defending force . <P> General Charles Pelot Summerall , Chief of Staff , paid the " war " a fleeting visit , inspected the field of action . Said he : " This war game constitutes the biggest and best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Army . " Just what it all meant strategically he left to the War College to study and say . <P> Reserve officers and National Guardsmen were aquiver with excitement . On the night before the big Red drive , few if any of them got any sleep . Brig. - General Cornelius Vanderbilt , commanding the 154th Brigade of the New York Guard , waited bravely for the attack at the Wrightstown-Lakewood crossroads . When along toward dawn it did not occur , he rolled up in his blanket and took a 60-minute catnap on the roadside . <P> A Red propaganda sheet called the Daily Ananias was rained down upon the Blue Forces . To break enemy morale , it stated : " Blues Poison More Wells , " " Prisoners Surrender to Reds Voluntarily , " " Blues Fear Red Bayonets , " " Mutinous Blue Soldiers Hang Colonel . " <P> After four days of savage combat , General Ely led his general officers into a cinema house at Bordentown , explained what had been done , told them their performance " smacked of military genius . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained emergency army of 200,000 in the Second Corps Area for instant military service , bemoaned the fact that the U. S. has no such force now .
