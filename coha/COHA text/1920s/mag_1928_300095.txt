Every Englishman likes kippered herring for breakfast , and especially " Yarmouth Bloaters , " which are quite superior " kippers . " Therefore true Britons have a sentimental liking for the old East Anglican city of " Yarmouth on the Yare . " Last week 2,600 Conservative Party Delegates bustled out to Yarmouth , assembled in the famed " Seaside Hippodrome , " and became momentously the Conservative Party Conference . Solemn was the occasion , for a platform would soon be drafted on which the Party will appeal to the country in the forthcoming Parliamentary Election . <P> Across the Hippodrome stretched a 100-foot banner-slogan : Stanley for Stability ! Excited delegates knew that Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin was about to speak and officially open the national campaign . When it seemed that beloved Stanley Baldwin was going to be just a bit late , as usual , the Conference vented high spirits by singing to an old , rollicking tune a new and most significant campaign song : <P> Mr. Baldwin thought it time , <P> Parley-vous , <P> To bring the ladies into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal " vote , <P> If only to stop the Socialists ' dope , <P> Inky pinky Parley-vous . <P> <P> " Flappers " &; " Reds . " The song sums up in a few catchy and atrocious rhymes the nub of what Stanley Baldwin had to say when he finally arose and spoke . The line about " ladies " having " along with men an equal vote " refers to the chief accomplishment of the Baldwin Cabinet , namely enfranchisement of 5,000,000 young British women by the passage of the famed Equal Franchise ( " Votes for Flappers " ) Bill ( TIME , Aug. 13 et ante ) . <P> The doggerel line about stopping the " Inky pinky . . . Socialists ' dope " proved to be almost the theme of Prime Minister Baldwin 's platform speech . Said he : " The great campaign issue is once more , as it was in 1924 , the challenge of Socialism against constitutionalism and against British individualism . On that issue the way that the People of Great Britain will vote can not be doubted ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and vitally significant . They meant that the British Conservative Party expects to win again by telling John Bull and his women that the Labor Party ( Socialist ) is a pack of " Reds . " In 1924 the " Red " stigma was fastened upon Labor Prime Minister James Ramsay MacDonald , when the Conservatives released the notorious " Zinoviev Letter " on election eve . The " Letter " purported to show that Labor Leaders were receiving pay and orders from " Moscow . " Today , after four years of pointing at the Red Bogey Man , the Conservatives and " Stability " Baldwin apparently believe that they can strike the old attitude again and win . <P> In referring to the third British party ( Liberal ) , Mr. Baldwin said : " The most they even hope for is to achieve the position of holding a ' balance of power . ' * <P> " The country has a right to ask them before the election whether , if they hold it , they will put the Socialists in office . The Labor Socialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the strength of the extremists communists within their ranks makes them dangerous . " <P>
