Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Satan that Christ also came among them . And SATAN ( Said unto Christ ) Whence comest thou ? CHRIST ( Answered Satan and said ) From going to and fro in the earth , and from walking up and down in it . ( And ) SATAN ( Said unto Christ ) Hast thou considered my servant Judas ? For there is none like him in the earth , an evil and a faithless man , one that feareth me and turneth away from God . ( Then ) CHRIST ( Answered Satan and said ) Doth Judas fear theefor naught ? Hast thou not made a hedge about him , and about his house , and about all that he hath on every side ? But draw back thy hand now and he will renounce thee to thy face . ( And ) SATAN ( Said unto Christ ) Behold , all that he hath is in thy power . ( So Christ went forth from the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years are but a moment before Satan and before God , and at the end of this moment Christ ascends again to his own place . He passes on this journey before the presence of the adversary. ) p. 3 SATAN You are alone ! Where is my son Judas whom I gave into your hands ? CHRIST He follows me . SATAN I know what you have done . And the earth rejected you ? The earth rejected you ! All hell murmurs in astonishment . But where is Judas , my son and my joy ? CHRIST Even now he is coming . SATAN Even Heaven , when I reigned there , was not so tedious as this waiting . Know , Prince , that I am too proud to show all my astonishment at your defeat . But now that you are swallowing your last humiliation , now that your failure has shut the mouths of the angels , I may confess that for a while I feared you . There is a fretfulness in the hearts of men . Many are inconstant , even to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew even from the beginning that you would be able , for a season , to win their hearts with your mild eloquence . I feared that you would turn to your own uses this fret-fulness that visits them . But my fears were useless . Even Judas , even when my power was withdrawn from him , even Judas betrayed you . Am I not right in this ? CHRIST You are . SATAN You admitted him into your chosen company . Is it permitted to me to ask for how much he betrayed you ? CHRIST For thirty pieces of silver . p. 4 SATAN ( After a pause ) Am I permitted to ask to what role he was assigned in your company ? CHRIST He held its money bags . SATAN ( Dazed ) Does Heaven understand human nature as little as that ? Surely the greater part of your closest companions stayed beside you to the end ? CHRIST One stayed beside me . SATAN I have overestimated my enemy . Learn again , Prince , that if I were permitted to return to the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for thirty hours , I would seal all men to me and all the temptations in Heaven 's gift could not persuade one to betray me . For I build not on intermittent dreams and timid aspirations , but on the unshakable passions of greed and lust and self-love . At last this is made clear : Judas , Judas , all the triumphs of Hell await you . Already above the eternal pavements of black marble the banquet is laid . Listen , how my nations are stirring in new hope and in new joy . Such music has not been lifted above my lakes and my mountains since the day I placed the apple of knowledge between the teeth of Adam . ( Suddenly the thirty pieces of silver are cast upward from the revolted hand of Judas . They hurtle through the skies , flinging their enormous shadows across the stars and continue falling forever through the vast funnel of space . Presently Judas rises , the black stains about his throat and the rope of suicide . ) What have they done to you , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon you ? Come to me . Here there is comfort . Here all this violence can be repaired . The futile spite of Heaven can not reach you here . But why do you not speak to me ? My son , my treasure ! ( Judas remains with lowered eyes. ) p. 5 CHRIST Speak to him then , my beloved son . JUDAS ( Still with lowered eyes , softly , to Satan ) Accursed be thou , from eternity to eternity . ( These two mount upward to their due place and Satan remains to this day , uncomprehending , upon the pavement of hell. )
