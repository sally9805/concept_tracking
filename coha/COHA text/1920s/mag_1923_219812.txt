Blood was shed in the Prussian Diet when a free fight took place between the Socialists and the Communists . <P> The ultimatum was delivered by the Communists , after a vote of lack of confidence by the reactionary German Nationals in the Minister of the Interior had been defeated by 248 to 79 votes . Herr Katz , Communist , then tried to get an explanatory note written into the records , but the Socialist President , Herr Leinert , would not permit this . Katz thereupon called the Socialists " greasy scoundrels , " an appellation which incensed the Socialists , who called out : " Drag the dirty dog down from the platform . " <P> Hostilities commenced immediately afterwards . Injuries to scalps , eyes and noses were inflicted by the irate parties . The scene was the most sanguine and disgraceful in the annals of the Prussian Parliament . <P> An armistice having been granted by the victorious Socialists , the President of the Diet suspended Herr Katz for 15 days . Peace was then declared .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
