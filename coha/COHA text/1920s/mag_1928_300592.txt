There are approximately 800,000 college or university students in the U. S. What if an editor could find a common denominator to their interests and publish a magazine that each of these 800,000 would read ? To probers of student psychology the publication would be a telltale document . And to tailor , tobacconist , maker of sweets or shoes-what a medium for national advertising ! <P> Such a magazine , according to editors of College Humor , is College Humor , a monthly which prints collegiate stories by professional humorists , reprints jokes and drawings from college periodicals . But recently it seemed that College Humor neither represented nor pleased the tastes of U. S. colleges . <P> In the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis met six of the representatives of 14 college humorous publications which together form the Midwest College Comics Association . Thoroughly they repudiated College Humor , unanimously they resolved not to renew contracts to give that magazine exclusive reprint rights . <P> Reasons given by Michigan Gargoyle Business Manager Carl U. Fauster , President of the Association , were : " College Humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false impressions about college life . . . . College Humor is claimed to be receiving advertisements on the assumption that as a magazine it covers the college field whereas the general belief expressed is that it does not cover the field but is read mostly by factory girls , drug store cowboys and high school students . . . . " <P> Potent source of indignation was an advertising survey published by College Humor estimating the cost of a full page advertisement in 86 college comics at $3,409.84 , which by tacit inference was about $2,000 more than the same advertisement would cost in College Humor , presumably read by the same public . <P> Further indignation was caused by an article describing students at the University of Virginia* as genial and not infrequent drinkers. + Editors of University of Virginia magazines , outraged , pledged their efforts to have the Eastern College Comics Association also repudiate College Humor . The sole other college comic association , the Western , voted to cancel all contracts with it eight months before the recent action of the Midwestern . <P> Unperturbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which covered seven fraternities in colleges from Yale to Wisconsin , from Syracuse to the University of Virginia , where at Kappa Sigma more than 95% of the fraternities were readers of College Humor . The result of this survey showed that out of 276 collegians , 242 read College Humor regularly , frequently or occasionally . <P> <P> * Not a member of the Midwestern association . There are three college comic associations : the Western , including colleges west of a line drawn south through Denver ; the Eastern , including colleges east of a line drawn south through Pittsburgh ; the Midwestern lying between the two . <P> +At Colorado College last week , all formal social activities except the Junior Promenade were suspended because of student drinking .
