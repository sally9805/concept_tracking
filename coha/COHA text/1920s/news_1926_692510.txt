So great has been the evolution in manufacturing and sales methods and policies that even those who follow its trail day by day fail to realize that a metamorphosis has taken place . The " drivers " of the era which came to an end with the experiences of 1920-1921 are practically out of the business . The biggest change is in the personnel of the management of the larger companies . The executives who looked on dealers as absorptive sponges , having limitless capacity to take cars , are practically gone ; in their places are a second generation of presidents and sales managers who measure the absorptive capacity of a dealer 's field by delicate instruments . They expect n dealer to produce what is normal in sales for the territory , but if be fails they try to help the dealer find his troubles before throw . ing him overboard .

Clarence Dillon is seching closer dealer relationship by putting two Dodge dealers on the board of directors . Hudson does n't indulge in any big dinners or dealer entertainments  --  that company 's methods stand out in contrast to some of the others  --  but the end is the same .
