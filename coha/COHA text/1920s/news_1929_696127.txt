" Jack and the Beanstalk " is authentic biography . Betcha bottom dollar on that . It 's a real story of a real 134 . Our readers may be sure that everything described in this thrilling narrative actually happened . Or Should have done so . But lt. ' s nobody 's darn business If it did or did n't . The book is exciting from beginning to end . It is.a human document , the story of a noble boy 's heroic fight to save money to go to college and buy a coonskin'coat . The author 's first adventure was after he had traded the family cow to a butcher for three beans . Jack ( for that is his name ) thought he had ' made a fine bargain and went home laughing merrily ; but his mother gave him a kick . in the pants and threw the beans out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took root and grew Into a great tree that reached up to the clouds . There has been some question raised on this point . ' It has been declared that beans do not grow over night to such a height . All right , anybody who thinks so can get out of ' our book club . And stay out . We pick our bOOks , : and when we pick ' eta they stay picked . Well , ' anyhow , Jack climbed the beanstalk and made his way to the castle of a terrible giant who ate people alive without salt or pepper . Which is not altogether a pleasure . We can think of ( lots of pet:pie who would make very tough eating . Jack hid in a closet , but as the giant entered the room he heard him repeating a poem he had composed all by himself , the poor simp . Think of a big , husky giant-sitting down and writing poetry when he ought to havp been roosting around In circus side shows or licking dry snoopers . Pee , fie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Englishman . " Ah , " said Jack to himself , " It 's Eddie Guest . " But when he peeked out of the door ho saw it was n't Eddie at all . No sir , it was a great , big cruel:giant ... The-giant brought out a hen which laid golden eggs . Yes , ' golden eggs ! Our judges carefully investigated this story and have found out that is possible . Not.usual , no , but entirely Possible. , That -. night Jack stole the hen and slid down the beariine back to his home . For a long time Jack . and ; his mother lived very comfortably off the ' gold eggs , as Well they might , buying a radio , a. used car , and going , to the movies every day . What more could they want ? But after a while Jack.again " climIrd the beanstalk and walked right up to the castle Just as : nervy as a ' bond salesman .. The giant 's wife came to the door and opened it as she had done before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just peeked out at Jack . She was a pale , meek looking woman . Being married ' , to a giant is no cinch , Think of cooking three meals a day for a man who thinks nothing of eating a couple of cows , three lambs , six bushels of potatoes and two hundred and twentylive loaves of bread and fifty or sixty pies at a sitting ! . " You get the hell outten ' here , " said the giant 's lady to Jack . " The last boy . I took in ' Stole the ' old man 's pet hen that laid golden ' - eggs . And listen , my lad , when you get beat.up by a giant you do n't forget it very soon . " " 0 , please let mo in , " said Jack , " I 'm a ' nice young . fellew trying to get on in the world . , Comecn , now , have a heart .

Jack ' heard a clinking sound as the giant carried the bags to the table . " Ah , pre-war ' Scotch , " chuckled Jack . " I can get eighteen dollars a quart for that stuff when I get it borne . " But the giant opened the bags and took out great handfuls of gold dollars . " 0 , boloney , " said Jack , ' " it 's just gold . " . After a while the giant tossed off several kegs of ale and six cases of gin and began to get sleepy . I Finally his head fell forward on the table and he snored so loud that Jack thought at first It was - thunder . He . crept out of his ' hiding place , and seizing the money bags , ran safely to his bean vine and climbed down to his home . " Where did you get all that coin , you dirty faced little bum ? " asked his mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe that children should bo spoiled by a lack of proper home influences . " Why , " said Jack , " I took the quarter you gave me and bought some stock in Wall street and the market went to hellengone and I cleaned up ' big . " " That 's fine , " said the mother , " now I can buy a fur coat . " Jack did n't have to Climb the beanstalk again for quite a while . But one night his mother said that the monthly installments on her fur coat had n't been paid for quite a spell and the man was threatening to grab It back and maybe Jack had better go to work . Jack would rather do anything than work , so the next morning up the jolly old beanstalk he climbed once more . But this time our hero got into a bad jam . He tried to swipe a harp that the giant owned and which would play every time he turned the knobs on it and tuned in to W-G-Nand there was n't too much static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment there was a radio police call to all ilivver squads and cops generally that somebody was carrying off the harp in the giant 's castle . So the . glarit looked around and saw Jack and chased him down the beanstalk . Jack reached the ground first , and , seizing a used safety razor blade , chopped down the bean vine and the giant went into a tailspin and came down with a crash . " Three cheers ! " shouted Jack 's happy mOther . " he 's busted his darn head . " As will be seen by glancing at the mere outline of the story , it is indeed what our judges claim  --  authentic biography . Every incident told in the book is absolutely true , although we have now learned that there is a considerably larger amount of . romanticized ? facts interwoven and kicking around.loose with the underlying sequence than we had at first noticed . But if you 're smart enough to take notice of a little pleasant elaboration here and there , then go on and pick your own books out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
