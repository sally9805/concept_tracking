AN INDIAN JOURNEY-Waldemar Bonsels-A . &; C. Boni ( $4 ) . <P> The better to study enigmatic reptile nature , the Sahib kept a cobra under glass , until he found he was losing caste with the natives for imprisoning a god . And throughout his Indian sojourn he learned to understand that reverence for the almighty cobra . One night he was wakened by an unearthly din ; his terrified dog crept under the mosquito netting with him . In a pool of moonlight a family of cats fought with a host of rats : danse macabre to the rhythm of warlike squeaks and terrific meows : Then sudden silence . A glistening cobra had glided out of the gloom . Glassy-eyed , cats and rats , man and dog , stared fascinated while the snake feasted upon a rat , upon a kitten . <P> The horror of the jungle haunts the fevered dreams Bonsel records , but he tells of waking hours filled with the serene beauty of India and the calm philosophy of its lowliest inhabitant .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
