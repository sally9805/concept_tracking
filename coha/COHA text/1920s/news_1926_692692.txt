txt The transportation problem in England 's general strike would present no great difficulty if roadless vehicles of the caterpillar or semi-caterpillar type had been in general use when the strike was ordered . They would be able to go anywhere across country , as the tank did in France in the great war . There would be a tremendous saving in distance and therefore in. time . On the first day of the strike railway transportation was crippled , motor and automobile service in city streets and on interior roads was meagre , and the subways were functioning lamely . On the third day the improvement . was marked , but transportation was still far from adequate . A little book , " Pegasus on Problems of Transportation , " by Colonel T. P. C. FULLER , a British war veteran , which is a brief for making the roadless motor vehicle generally available , is just off the presses . It should command attention in the crisis .

" Overpopulation and unemployment inspired him to project and explain his idea , " although many will consider my prophecy ridiculous . " He says : There are three solutions to this problem . Either we in England must stop breeding , or we must create new home industries and so absorb our surplus population , or we must transport it to less thickly ' opulated areas overseas . Colonel FULLER has a nimble pen and an imagination that Illumines his subject . He rules birth control out of the discussion , though he thinks it might be made " compulsory among politicians . " He has no great liking for them : they talk so much and do so little . He is sure that the problem ? of overpopulation will never be solved by the dole : Cutting and doling can be done by any fool with his coat on , they are too easy ; for the problem which faces us demands that we take our coats off and get to work , in place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is his belief that the quicker and ampler transportation is , the sooner the empty spaces of the world will be settled and developed by moving into them surplus populations . The steamship and the railway must be used first and then the motor vehicle will be called in . Of all motor vehicles he considers the roadless ty the most useful , because it can go anywhere and take the man to his work and his products to market in much less time than the motor truck rolling along a metal or a hard dirt road . " Without " considering our immense colonial " possessions , " says Colonel PULLER , " the potential wealth of the Do " minions alone should eventually be " sufficient to support certainly one " if not two hundred millions of Eng " lishmen .

Colonel FiThLv " , is Sure that the cost per to - mile would be lower than that of existing vehicles . He cites the penetration of the Sahara from Touggourt to Timbuctoo by the Citroen motor cars , fitted with M. Kscassses 's half-tracks . They traveled at an average speed of 112 miles a day . He is enthusiastic about the possibilities of the rordless vehicles In minini , and oil countries and in deserts that could be irrigated and made fruitful .
