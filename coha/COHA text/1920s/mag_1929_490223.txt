IT was a hot , glaring morning with life in its shirtsleeves , when we chanced on a rehearsal of the Goldman Band in the Mall . There was a fairish crowd  --  men , old women , malts , n ursemaids , hallnuns , ve locipe des . The conductor had hung his hat on the podium . He rehearsed perfervid gestures . The great brass hell of the tuba shook the cave of music . The hand sweated crescendo , gave forth Schubert . At a climax in the music the conductor glanced hopefully sidewise to observe the effect on the audience . There was none . Faces held the limp gaze ; hands hung at the het side . Probably the same crowd returned at night , when dusk had let fall a cool blue backdrop of illusion , to applaud the same music . Under the white light of a midsummer morning , the music had lost its power ; it was heard with a dull dread ; it was without modulation , like the smell of cabbage in a dark hallway . AGENTLEMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking by counting other men that he passes as tall or taller than himself ( it keeps him from thinking ) reports that in New York six-foot men average but about three or four in one hundred . While he has never counted women , he has observed generally that they are taller than they used to be . The other day he was able to correlate his aimless findings when he learned from one of the new quasi-scientific books that women are crying for taller and still taller husbands . Our investigator has concluded that this is because of the greater height of the women themselves , resulting from freer clothes , golf , independent thinking , etc. , and not because the tall men are particularly desirable in themselves . Indeed , he finds them mostly either gaunt , worried , and given to jumping at unusual noises in the street , or else bulky and stooped with a dismal look of resignation . To his mind their state is due to the taller woman 's search for still taller men and he thinks the whole thing will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's digestion , until a super-race is developed . IT surprises us that mechanical inven-tions , like the motor car and the airplane , take so long to work themselves into literature . We ca n't remember ever having read anything that quite gave us the feeling of driving a car , that quite expressed the new reflexes of motordorn : the things the left leg knows , the canny right toe , the mind that resolves situations , the compensations and adjustments of hand and foot . Nor have the stories of airplane flights been anything but disappointing . No poet or novelist has ever got us very far off the ground in a plane , somehow or other . They have n't caught the unique detachment of high flying , the soul 's expansion during a first air voyage , the oppressive monotony of faith in a single motor , the claustrophobia of being suspended in an element for which one is personally unequipped . When one thinks of the magnificent way men are flinging themselves around in space , it seems strange the writing has been so feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , we took her down to the Ellin Prince Speyer Hospital to get some professional advice on cod-liver oil . The visit was a disarming experience ; it gave us a renewed sense of the benevolence of humanity as well as the dignity of animals . The reception room , white and sterile ; the reception lady , starched and kindly ; the other patients , soft-eyed and wet-nosed ; the phone calls , " He has no temperature today ! , " were all part of a strong impression that this was the nicest place in New York . And when our turn came , and we ushered Daisy into the examination room and were greeted by a doctor who wore gray spats , it was too much happiness . Even Daisy was impressed , and took a turn for the better . MHE most interesting book reviews 1 we have read lately were written not by a critic but by a publisher .

A perfect fiend for code messages , we instantly dispatched a telegram to the American Book .

Some business executives have issued instructions to their employees never to say good morning to them , this because they always arrive at the office of a morning with an idea and it is liable to he lost between the elevator and their office if they take their attention from it . Roosevelt always had a very hearty good morning fin everybody , Wilstin spoke , and even Coolidge nodded and sometimes made a small sound . Mob Scene r-rHE current idol , Rudy Vallee , goes around singing on hot afternoons . At Gimbel 's last week the store began to crowd up 15a1f an hour ahead of time with women who are left desolate by such things as Valentino 's death and Lindbergh 's marriage and with a flavoring of young men with oiled hair , one of whom kept running a comb through his .

A Gimbel man stood on a platform , asked for silence , and announced that Rudy had been delayed by traffic . The feminine crowd sound went up , half giggle , half snarl . Restiveness increased . The more sturdy women climbed on the top of new , unsold pianos , their bundles still nursed in their arms . Timid attendants spoke sharply to little boys who did likewise , hoping the women would take the hint and get down , but the women stared ciddly past them . " C mberla in ! Chamberlain ! " shouted the Gimbel man . Chamberlain was the slim young man in charge of a radio , against which he was jammed . " Louder ! " demanded the Gimbel official . " Wo n't play any louder , " said Chamberlain . When Rudy and his men finally appeared the crowd wailed sharply . The orchestra and its leader fought their way to the platform . The men wore tan Palm Beach suits , Rudy himself a blue suit and scarlet tie . Out the second chorus of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gold on the interior , and began to sing . The song was an Alpine breeze to the sweltering ladies . They forgot even their suffering feet . At the end of the song , however , they jostled .

She was middle-aged , like most of the crowd , to whom , one must conclude , the curly-haired boy was not the ideal lover , but the ideal son . They wish their Frcds and Joes were like that .

The scaffolding which bristles around St. Nicholas Church at Forty-eighth Street and its spire is somewhat spectacular . This is the first renovation the church has had since 1886 . Not only are loose fragments of sandstone being scraped off , but in some cases whole stones are being removed and replaced with new ones . As everyone knows , brownstone  --  while charming  --  yields to weather and is apt to come off in slivers . It has been doing this on the facade of the Salmagundi Club at No. 47 , away down the Avenue , where another stone-renovating company is at work ; or it may just quietly disintegrate , as may he observed in the decaying pillars on the little window balconies of the Finley Shepard house at Forty-seventh Street . This is closed and hoarded now and nothing is being done about it . The eyes of older bus-riders widened last week at the sight of scaffolding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wendel place at Thirty-ninth Street . No one can remember ever having seen signs of workaday life there before . At Ninth Street , incidentally , there is talk of disturbing the so-called Mark Twain house . Twenty-five years ago Twain used to lie abed all morning here , smoking his black cigars . The first two floors were recently leased to the Washington Square National Bank and this caused the grimly hauling Washing-ton Square Association , jealous of its vanishing treasures , to take court action We arc told that the lawyers and the judiciary will be at least two years settling this case of ? Sentiment vs . Progress . Thus there is time to look at the house , if you have never examined it . Most everyone is familiar with the plaque on the Ninth Street side , which hears the images of Washington Irving and Twain . A special room was once set aside for Irving , who used to visit there frequently in his day . Twain rented the house from 19 ( 14 to 19 ( 18 . You ca n't get inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirts/reeved janitor comes and says the place is private now and that he does n't know which is the Irving room . It is owned by Mr. Edward Renwick Whittingham , direct descendant of the Renwick family , which has held the land for two hundred and fifty years . Some years ago Mr. ' Whittingham made the building over into small apartments , but even when fully tenanted it has turned a profit of only fortyfi dollars . One of the Renwicks married a daughter of Henry Brevoort , whose home used to be where the Fifth Avenue Hotel now is . ? Across the now feverishly seething way from Twain 's old residence , the Berkeley Hotel is worth more than a glance . The lobby is rich and dark , the stairs are wide and are carpeted with the red shade of the nineties , the elevator is an old-timer . The doors here are still locked at midnight and guests must carry keys .

" asked the lady , whose hearth and home were in the vicinity and whose dander was up . " It ai n't ladylike , " said the officer . Anthropologically the incident is important . The west side of the Village is still a Hibernian stronghold , whose folkways of a hundred years ago remain unchanged . You ca n't fool a Whalen cop when it comes to anthropology . Guest Maestro ARERT COATES , who conducts the Stadium concerts these warm evenings , was burn in Petrograd , but of English parents . In his late twenties he met the Czar , and it left its effect . Recently he directed Tschaikowsky 's " Marche Slave , " of which " God Save Our Noble Czar , " the erstwhile Russian national anthem , is a part . After the concert Mr. Coates told friends that tears came into his eyes at this point and that he had scarcely been able to finish the composition . This because he admired the late Nicholas II and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of twenty-eight that Mr. Coates , then senior orchestra leader of the Imperial Opera of Petrograd , was granted his first audience with the Little Father of All the Russias . Very much impressed by this honor , the young maestro bowed low and addressed the monarch as " Your Majesty . " " Oh , do n't call me that , " said the Czar , or its equivalent in Russian . " Just call me Mr. Ro-manoff . " Mr. Coates studied under the famous Nikisch . The latter criticized a tendency in his pupil to brandish his baton vehemently . " A baton seems insufficient for your feelings , " he de-dared . " You had better use a whip . " Now the conductor employs his empty hands . He remarked the other day that within two years no self-respecting contemporary will use a baton before an orchestra . The visitor is superstitious . He carries in his right breast pocket a fourth-century Russian ikon of hammered brass , and to this he attributes any good fortune he has . Astrologers and Fortune tellers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this leaves him only ten years more , he intends to he very busy from now on . Among other things he plans is the composition of an opera based on O'Neill 's " The Hairy Ape . " He would use the German translation for his parposes , as he considers it more impressive than the English of the original . He has several residences in various places , one on Lake Maggiore , holy , at which G. B. Show is an occasional visitor . The two go bathing clad only in loincloths . In New York Mr. Coates leads a simple life because of the rigorousness of his work . He likes American ice cream , frequently eating a quart of it after a concert . Banana is his favorite flavor . This is a good place to tell what Van Hoogstraten , who surrendered his place to Coates for part of the sum-nice , did during one of the last concerts he directed before going away . He had just launched his orchestra into the " Liebestod " when an airplane flew over the stadium , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Hoogstraten stopped the orchestra , waited until the plane disappeared , and then started the composition all over again . ?

In the past , gentlemen of a certain influence had only to hint that they found ordinary Pullmans stuffy and they could get a car to themselves on reasonable terms . The practice has been a sort of fine old tradition . But the Interstate Commerce Commission , which takes care of everything , recently came upon an old ledger which specifies that anyone who desires a coach to himself must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coach of his own ( or the railroad may substitute a private car , if it pleases ) but it takes the twenty-five fares . Since the old request for courtesy rates had more or less got out of hand anyhow , the railroads are said to have accepted the rebuke from the federal commission in good spirits . The Mayor , they say , can probably get around it at that . Bill Egan , Pennsylvania stationmaster , might accompany him and this , in addition to adding to the fun , would probably make the journey a business trip , technically ; or he can probably borrow Mr. Kenney 's private car . Waggery MR . GERALD 5 . DEAN , wil0 is a waggish lawyer of downtown , shipped two alligators to a friend a year ago . Last week he opened a box , revealing a porcupine , hurt , angry , and quills .

Chandeliers , colonial desks , and wainscoting of white pine panels complete the effect of the main room . Downstairs in the vaults the lights arc so arranged that the attendant has to stoop down to turn them off and thus he will inevitably sec and recover any coupons which have been cut off and then dropped accidentally to the floor .

City of Opportunity SIX jolly officers from one of the English boats went exploring the other night and after dining well found themselves , shortly after nine o'clock , at the corner of Broadway and Forty-fourth Street , trying in a vague way to make up their minds what to do next . They became aware that a small , mysterious man was talking very earnestly to them .

In a short time , the head usher was whispering in the ear of the mast responsible-looking member of the party . " You gentlemen do n't really want to see this play at all , do you ? " he suggested tactfully . They said no , they really did n't ; whereupon the usher led them to the box office and money , to the amount of twenty-six dollars and forty cents , was given them for their seats . In a very short time all six were lined up at a bar in Forty-eighth Street , spending their twenty-one dollars and forty cents cool profit .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
