Back in Washington from their inspection of Pennsylvania 's bituminous social carbuncle , Senator Gooding and colleagues of the Interstate Commerce subcommittee drew up chairs and summoned witnesses to put their investigation on paper , in formal style . The first witness was President John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers . <P> Police brutality , onerous anti-picketing injunctions , and the breakdown of the Jacksonville agreement were the burden of Mr. Lewis ' tale which rambled somewhat under stress of emotion . President Coolidge 's letter to Mr. Lewis in December 1925 , was read into the record deploring " the breaking of any contract , " explaining why the U. S. could not intervene , referring the miners to the courts , pronouncing collective bargaining to be " a principle now accepted in American life . " Mr. Lewis repeated the miners ' charge that railroads , notably the Pennsylvania , had thumbscrewed the mine operators into thumbscrewing the miners . The names " Rockefeller " and " Mellon " occurred forcibly but somewhat extraneously , in Mr. Lewis ' speech . <P> Carl E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took the stand to answer questions fired by a mine union attorney . This colloquy dwelt chiefly on strikebreaking conditions at the mines , lurid with references to Pinkerton detectives , lewd Negroes ' criminal assaults on mine women . Mr. Lesher passed on to his chief , President John D. A. Morrow of the Pittsburgh Coal Co. , responsibility for the company 's newspaper advertisements of last fortnight , which asserted that the investigating Senators were " prejudiced . " Mr. Lesher said : " Perhaps we are unfortunate in that our material is prosaic and that of the other side is sensational . " <P> " There is nothing prosaic about abrogating a contract , " snapped Senator Wheeler . The Pittsburgh Coal Company 's reasoning was that , though it agreed to pay union miners $7.50 per day , it did not agree to employ union miners any longer than it saw fit . It was employing non-union men before and after the signing of the agreement , with the unions ' knowledge . When it reduced the non-union men 's pay to $6 per day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , it claimed , " acting legally . " According to Miner Lewis , this action was taken by Operator Warden in an effort to make a good record after the company had passed a bad year under the direction of Richard B. Mellon . <P> Presidents F. E. Herriman , of the Clearfield Bituminous Coal Corpn. , Rembrandt Peale , of the Peale , Peacock &; Kerr , and J. W. Searles , of the Pennsylvania Coal &; Coke Co. , all testified that they had considered the Jacksonville agreement , bitter bone of the whole contention , to be morally as well as legally binding . President Horace F. Baker , of the Pittsburgh Terminal Co. , has already testified the same ( despite contradiction by his competitor , President Morrow ) , having established that his company kept the agreement , was not again called to the stand .
