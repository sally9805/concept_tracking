Elocution is no longer a major sport in , U. S. schools , but it is still taught and practiced . Teachers still divide up the subject into various branches : viz. , recital of poems , original oration , debate , the extemporaneous speech . The latter is always regarded as the most sporting . A boy is handed a slip of paper on which a subject is written such as " Capital Punishment . " * For five minutes he is permitted to twitch nervously in his seat while his undernourished brain works feverishly to synthesize all that he has read , been told , suspected about the matter . A bell rings . He marches to the platform , plunges into a sentence the end of which is invisible , stops , begins again , stutters , finally gets hold of a word , likes it , takes hold of it , and with a ridiculous but earnest gesture , gallops it into a climax , becomes suddenly convinced of the justice of his cause , imprecates the Deity , dismounts . <P> But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Nominee , he accepts the Nomination . Nominee Hoover was never one of the smartalecks who actually had fun at Elocution Classes . All his years , he has dreaded the necessity to extemporize . Nor has he even triumphed with the " original oration , " but an original oration he had to make last week ( see col. 3 ) . <P> For a month , some say for three months , he had been at work on it . Two weeks before delivery he sent it to a printer , in greatest confidence . Back it came in long strips of type . He showed it first to William Joseph ( " Wild Bill " ) Donovan of New York . He showed it to a few others . And again and again he read it all through to himself , in his Palo Alto study . Safe to say , that , years hence , he will associate that speech far more closely with that room than with the stadium in which it was for the last time voiced . <P> The important thing about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance the Golden Gate ; near to the eye , Stanford University grounds ; and , chiefly , a great redwood tree , solitary , centuries old , unique because no-other redwood ever grew so high at such an elevation . That tree is Stanford 's emblem . Emblem and motto , joined on shield , hang on the wall by the desk on which the Hoover speech was cast and recast . The motto : " Die Luft der Freiheit weht . " It is the only U. S. college motto in German just as Hoover , according to the tradition he favors , will be , if elected , the only U. S. President of German descent in the direct line . <P> Translated , the motto means : " Strongly blow the winds of freedom . " It is itself an authentic breath from the pre-Bismarckian Germany , which loved beer and learning and the hearth and which was not at all imperialist . <P> That high mob-scorning redwood , that flowingly romantic verse , that Nominee-even famed Mark Sullivan , popular political commentator , tried and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> * For English boys , the usual test is the legality of the execution of bewhiskered Charles I.
