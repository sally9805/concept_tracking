Since February , newspapermen have been increasingly sure that William Randolph Hearst is , for the first time in his career , retrenching . The following deals are pertinent evidence : <P> He sold two tabloids , New York Daily Mirror and Boston Advertiser , to Alexander Pollock Moore , U. S. Ambassador to Peru , for a price which was said to be dirt cheap . ( It was even hinted that this was a " dummy " sale and that Hearst privately remains the financial angel of the two tabloids . ) <P> He killed his third tabloid , Baltimore American , by merging it with his full-sized Baltimore News . This was part of a complicated compromise with his Baltimore rivals , the Sun-papers , by which he allowed the Evening Sun to get Associated Press rights without paying him one cent . Hearst had not been known before as a man of compromises . <P> He discontinued his Oakland , Calif. , Times . <P> He sold two magazines , Smart Set and McClure 's , to James R. Quirk . <P> These deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ordered his general manager , Col. William Franklin Knox , to cut down expenses by $10,000,000 this year . <P> Hearst now has 24 newspapers , ten magazines , eight feature , news and film services , also the Cosmopolitan Book Corp . Indeed , there is no danger of the wolf growling at Hearst 's door . Good Housekeeping alone is capable of buttering Hearst 's bread and of satisfying his large passion for antiques . He may be old ( 65 ) , but he is not yet ready to get out of journalism . Rather , he is trimming his properties , consolidating them , fertilizing the hardy ones , weeding out the weak ones ; so that a banker can look at them and say : " They are a sound unit . " But Hearst no longer cracks the whip that terrorized his rivals and upset the standards of journalism at the turn of the century . He is now willing to compromise , or to stand pat . <P> Coincidently , the first important biography of Hearst has appeared. * It depicts Hearst as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer , " as a devoted husband , " a keen student of the Bible , " and , through his newspapers , " a world force , " a man who " has shortened by a generation certain sorely needed social and political reforms . . . has awakened the public consciousness of the average citizen . . . . " <P> Some day , probably after Hearst has passed to the never-never land , his complete biography will be written . And it will contain many an amazing fact which Writer Winkler has , either deliberately or unknowingly , omitted . <P> There is , however , much of interest in Writer Winkler 's book : <P> . " Should anything untoward happen to William Randolph Hearst , the staffs of the various Hearst papers would be running about like ants , for their morgues contain no biography of their owner . The proprietor has given orders that no biography of himself be prepared . <P> . " Hearst is a man of orderly disorder . He transacts most of his business by telephone and telegraph . He maintains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he happens to be . He scribbles on the backs of envelopes , scraps of paper . He is an extremely indolent correspondent . In New York he has half a dozen luxuriantly appointed ' hideouts ' to which he may repair when he desires privacy . . . . "
