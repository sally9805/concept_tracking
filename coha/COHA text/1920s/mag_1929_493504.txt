As a matter of fact , during the five years of the plan , the requisite amounts were collected in Germany , and they were transferred to Germany 's creditors . Therefore it is. commonly said that the Dawes plan succeeded . But this judgment is completely upset by a somewhat unexpected development . People might want to send money into Germany , not merely to pay for an export surplus of goods and services , but also because Germans offered to borrow it at high rates of interest . That is precisely what happened . If the Germans had not borrowed so much money in the past five years , they could not even have paid for the imports they required , to say nothing of transferring reparations annuities . The successful transfer was not accompanied by the growth of an export surplus ; quite the reverse . The following table , compiled by Dr. H. G. Moulton , makes this clear : Germany 's Foreign Trade , 1925-28 By the end of 1928 foreign loans in Germany through public offerings totalled 6,878,000,000 gold marks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equalled this amount . German governments , businesses and citizens have borrowed abroad two marks for every mark that has been paid in reparations under the Dawes plan , and have used the surplus for buying the extra goods they needed , but could not pay for with exports . This immense influx of money enabled the reparation transfers to be made without any decline in the exchange value of the mark . It also greatly facilitated the collection of the necessary taxes within Germany , wherewith reparations were to be paid . For it stimulated construction of public works , of industrial buildings , and other current production . It lightened the burden of taxation for public improvements and thus allowed more to be collected for reparations . It poured into the national income a constant and enormous stream of foreign purchasing power . The Dawes plan was revised , ostensibly , because it was desirable to fix the total amount for which Germany was indebted , and to remove the foreign control over her finances . The Agent General for Reparations , Mr. S. Parker Gilbert , had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the other problems depending upon it will be finally solved until Germany has been given a definite task to perform on her own responsibility , without foreign supervision and without transfer protection . But the " definite task " ? in other words , the total amount to be paid ? could not be fixed on the basis of any demonstration furnished under the Dawes plan concerning Germany 's capacity to pay . We have no evidence yet that Germany can develop an export surplus . All the evidence we have concerns Germany 's capacity to borrow . But whether she can continue indefinitely to borrow at anything like the rate she has been borrowing remains an open question . The Dawes plan was a useful bridge by which to escape from the confusion which preceded it . But it settled none of the basic problems . The Young plan , which we shall begin to describe in the next article , is therefore just another experiment . GEORGE SOULE .
