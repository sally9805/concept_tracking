For the Brown Derby the testimonial-of-the-week was the following : <P> " Think of the humiliation and degradation which touches all of us when such a fine-spirited , straightforward , clean-minded and loyal man as Governor Smith is called a drunkard and a political crook ! . . . <P> " Mr. Hoover knows what ought to be done as well as Governor Smith , but he has not had opportunity to demonstrate his political capacity to get it done . Governor Smith has made his demonstration . ... I shall vote for Governor Smith as the man with the greatest demonstrated capacity for political leadership of any I have ever known . . . . He is one of the few great leaders of masses in all history who does not stoop to the tactics of the demagog ... No political leader in the world today , so far as I know-and I know most of them-has as much capacity for mass leadership as he . " - Owen D. Young , Board Chairman of the General Electric Co. , co-author of the so-called Dawes Plan .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
