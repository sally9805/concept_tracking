txt The State-wide dry enforcement bills are dead . They were killed after a brisk but not overlong battle just before the Senate went to dinner this evening . The result was not unexpected , but the victory of the " wets " was attended by at least one surprise . For months there has been much talk at the Capitol of four Republican votes , figuratively " off the wagon , " and . ' the ? consequent impossibility of passing the Wales-Jenks bills . For months Lieut . Gov . Lowman. the Senate leader , Senator Knight , and even Chairman George K. It:Terris of . the Republican State Committee are supposed to have been engaged in intensive missionary work frith a. view to saving the day by prevailing on at least one of the " wet " quartet to return to the dry fold . Tonight it turned out  --  but not . until the last vote In the Senate was being tallied : hat all the time the Wily ' wets ' had had an ace In the hole , " and that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more successful , the " dry " bills would have been defeated . Last Vote Reveals New " Wet . " It was the last name on the roll-call that revealed the presence of an unsuspected Republican recruit in the wet ranks . The surprise vote was cast by Senator John F. Williams of Troy who , in explaining it . declared that he had yet to know the taste of strong liquor , but nevertheless would be untrue to his own self should he permit himself to be counted with the " drys . " The final score stood 24-26 , the " drys " were short two votes instead of one of the 26 necessary to victory . The five Republicans who broke away from the , majority and joined the Democrats in voting no were Senators Earle of Queens , Lipowicz of Erie , Nicoll of New York , Whitley of Monroe and Williams of Rensselaer . The debate brougnt no new arguments either for or against the bills . The opposition denounced not only the principle of prohibition but its enforcement as demoralizing . The Eighteenth ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not resulted In prohibition or even temperance but had increased drinking and led to widespread corruption among public officials , blackmail and bribery ... The minority leader , Senator Walker , denounced the bills as measures put In for the sake of political expediency , measures in which many of those who for party reasons would be compelled to vote for them had no belief . Senator Nicoll , Renumican , and Senator Sheridan , Democrat . made caust.c comment on the prevalence of drinking ' , among lawmakers , Judges charged with the enforcement of law and others who preached and voted one way but drank in another , even tn public , at banquets and other festive occasions , The fight on tile bills was started by Senator Nicoll . ' I wonder if the sentiment In some of these so-called ' dry ' constituencies is as strong for prohibition as it has been represented to be ? " he ' asked . " My respect for the ' drys ' would be very much enhanced if they sent to Congress and to the Legislatures men who sincerely believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hundreds of people in this State are convinced today that these proposed bills have some magic sanctity . Investigation , however , has shown that these bills are plagiarisms ? of the Volstead law . They are Andrew Volstead dressed up . in a new suit and smoking a fresh cigar appeal-11m in our midst under the sponsorship of the respectable Chairman of the Assembly Committee on Judiciary . " In seven years , from one of the most law-abiding , civilized nations we have become the most lawless . Respect for law has disappeared , authority is laughed at , the Constitution of the United States has become a local issue , statutes are openly derided and privately flouted . We find the Congress enacting laws that its own members have no desire or intention of obeying and the officers of the Government sworn to uphold these laws openly violating them . ' Boys and girls of classes that never knew liquor in the old days become publicly intoxicated . Alcohol has permated the home , the colleges , the schools  --  almost in the nursery . The juniper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this disgraceful condition is largely due to the fact that we have tried to prohibit by this same law a thing that can not be stopped by law  --  desire of man ? as old as civilization  --  for stfmulents. and because we have tried to prohibit an act that he vast majority of the people of this country know is not wrong . " No one but a fanatic claims that - the use of intoxicating liquor is in itself wrong  --  to do so would indict the founder of Christianity as a Winner . It is only the abuse of alcohol that is wrong , and as expressed by the fathers of the church it is not the use but rather the abuse of the thing that is to be condemned . But the Federal Government has , in violation of every principle of reason , tried not to stop the abuse but to halt the very use of a legitimate thing , with the result that you all know and that I have endeavored to describe . " Switching Bills , Says Walker . Senator Wales of Broome. who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untie the hands of 25.000 local peace officers in the State and no longer make it necessary for 280 Federal agents to do the work that this army of 25,000 should do . He was followed by Senator Walker . " No man who drank before prohibition has stopped drinking since then , " the Senator said . " The army of drinkers , on the contrary , has been vastly augmented . These bills might ' well be called snitching bills , or squealing bills . Under them it is quite possible for your next door neighbor to be your guest in the evening and remain as long as your cellar holds out and then go out in the morning and swear out a warrant against you before a magistrate . . ' There is not a man in this Senate who is sincerely for these bills . All you who enter here to vote for these bills leave your consciences behind in the lobby . There may be fifty-one men in this chamber , but there can not be more than twenty-five consciences. / " Blackmail is the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of charity beginning at home that you are planning to let some of our native sons in on the good things incidental to prohibition enforcement in these days . " ? Senator Sheridan of Now York then got the floor . He said moral disintegration had followed ' in the wake of prohibition . Says Judges Drink in Public . " Go to a banquet in New York City and you can ace Judges charged with enforcement of the law , legislators and Congressmen ' drinking in public , " he excl aimed . " We must be the laughing stock of all of Europe , where we must be regarded as a land of hypocrites and colossal fakirs . It is time that we stopped playing politics and realized that the cure lies in regulation , not in Prohibition . We know that those who Aeek positions as Federal prohibition agents are not all actuated by a desire to enforce the law , and this is a. very charitable way of stating what is in the back of my mind . Prohibition has given rise to widespread corruption and bribery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let the Federal authorities continue to enforce the law . If they find it can not be enforced we may hope for some salutory changes in the law to make it workable . " Senator Love of Kings said that his sponsorship for the Clean Books bill had led to a belief in certain quarters that he might be prevailed on to cast the twenty-sixth vote for the " dry " bills . " I became a sponsor for the Clean Books bill because I regarded it important to protect the young from the effects of bad books , " he said . " I think , as a physician , that it is just as important to protect them from bad booze and there has never been so much bad booze as their is now since Mr. Volstead has stepped into the picture . " We must approach this subject not from the viewpoint of the heifers of Elmira , but from the viewpoint of the sidewalks of New York , that great melting pot of the Nordic races . ' Senator Knight , as a spokesman for his party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to determine here seems to me a plain one , " he said . " The Eighteenth Amendment is entitled to the same observance as any other part of the-Federal Constitution . So it comes back to a question whether we are in favor of observing and enforcing the fundamental law of the land . ' I can see no other phase to this question . " All that has been said here ) with regard to the failure in enforcement is an argument in favor of the . enactment of these bills . A lack of desire for State enforcement cannot. as I see it , be reconciled with-conscientious observance of the oath we have taken as Senators . " I-
