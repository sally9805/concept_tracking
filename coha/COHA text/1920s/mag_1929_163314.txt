In the Vatican last week were holy stirrings . Pope Pius XI was to address the Cardinals and add to their number , which Death had depleted from 70 ( full strength ) to 58 . A secret consistory was held . Silver trumpets sounded . The great Sistine choir chanted . There were parades and regalias . <P> But Pius XI created only one new Cardinal , postponed other elevations until December , made only brief remarks . " Certain events have taken place with which we shall deal later on in the year , " he said , evidently referring to friction between the Papal State and Fascist Italy since the signing of their Concordat ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) . <P> Mgr . Ildefonso Schuster was the one new Cardinal . He had been informed of his approaching nomination weeks in advance but according to ritual he was formally nominated in secret consistory . Having spoken the name of his nominee , the Pope asked the assembled Cardinals , " Quid vobis videtur ? " ( " How does this seem to you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast red hat , symbol of Cardinals , was bestowed on Mgr . Schuster three days later in public consistory .

He was in turn embraced by the 25 assembled Cardinals , who touched his cheeks with theirs . <P> Cardinal Schuster will later be consecrated Archbishop of Milan , an office once held by Pius XI himself and by the late Cardinal Eugenius Tosi . His full title will then be Cardinal Archbishop . His elevation brought the number of Italian Cardinals to 27 , as against 32 men of other nations . <P> Ildefonso Schuster , son of a stalwart Swiss-German officer in the Vatican 's famed Swiss Guard , is accounted an Italian Cardinal because he was born in Rome .
