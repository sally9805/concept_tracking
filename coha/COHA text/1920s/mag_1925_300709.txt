Last week the plenipotent delegates of the twelve Powers represented at the Chinese Customs Conference ( TIME , Nov. 9 , 16 ) had need of all their prestige to keep up the appearance of negotiating with a Chinese Government which actually governs China . <P> The Conference , of course , is dealing with the Tuan Chi-jui Government at Peking . But last week it became clear to even the dullest observer that President Tuan , so-called " Chief Executive of China , " is a mere figurehead whose administration owes its very existence to the fact that internal squabbles are keeping the great Super-Tuchuns Feng , Chang and Wu , busy with their own private quarrels and intrigues . <P> Despatches reported early in the week that Feng and Chang were both moving large forces toward Peking , and that Feng who has thus far " supported " Tuan rather vaguely , had decided to overthrow him completely , and set up some other puppet in his place . Later cables showed these reports to have been fiction , and indicated that Feng and Chang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate warlike engagements in the vicinity of Peking . <P> But the impression remained that the Peking Government had suffered a bad setback in prestige . And at Tokyo , alarm over the situation was so great that the Japanese Cabinet was convened in extraordinary session to decide what steps should be taken in the event that Feng and Chang should commence to battle for Peking . <P> An official despatch from the U. S. Minister to China , John Van Antwerp McMurray , who with the famed Chicago lawyer , Silas H. Strawn , represents the U. S. at the Customs Conference , sketched the situation among the Tuchuns substantially as follows : <P> 1 ) The intentions of Super-Tuchun Feng are exceedingly obscure. -i . e. , Feng may continue in the role of " the Chinese Christian General who protects Peking " ; or he may unite with his old ally Chang ; or he may go over to his still older ally Wu , whom he " betrayed " last year . <P> 2 ) The forces of Chang are apparently executing an encircling movement to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feng , and in an attempt to block him from bringing down additional troops into the Peking region from his base at Kalgan . If this action be considered as taking place on Chang 's " front , " his " rear " is being attacked by Wu . <P> 3 ) The Wu forces have pushed the Chang rear guard up from the vicinity of Shanghai and across the Shantung-Kiangsu border . At the same time what might be called Chang 's " left flank " has been engaging the Wu forces in the interior . <P> The terms " front , " " rear " and " flank " are , of course , purely general . The forces engaged are spread over an immense area in large and small detachments . Wu is supposed to have 300,000 men , and Chang and Feng 150,000 each . It was persistently rumored that Feng 's chief lieutenant , Yueh Weichun , had gone over to Wu , that he would soon be followed by Feng himself . <P> Additional reports contained interesting accounts of the steps being taken by Super-Tuchun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on something like an occidental footing .
