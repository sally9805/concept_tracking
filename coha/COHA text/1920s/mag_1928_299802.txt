What is a " whispering campaign " ? Is it a pack of slanders deliberately and covertly set afoot by one 's political opponents in an organized way ? Is it a mixture of fact , exaggeration and gossip on unprintable subjects which one 's political opponents know is being passed around and over which they secretly gloat ? Is it a parcel of prejudice circulated by the ignorant and the fanatical , which one 's opponents would be powerless to arrest however fairminded they might be ? <P> Whatever it is , an anti-Smith " whispering campaign " has been suspected , proclaimed , viewed-with-alarm , pointed-with-shame , loudly flayed by the Democrats . Last week the Democratic outcry reached a new pitch and counteraction was planned against the three outstanding Whispers . <P> Roman Catholicism . Meeting at Columbus , Ohio , the National Lutheran Editors ' Association , a body representing , two million readers of Lutheran literature , brought out of the whispering gallery and into the amplifiers the oldtime subject of Nominee Smith 's Roman Catholicism . While not presuming to campaign openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers that the Roman Catholic Church requires of its members allegiance to a " foreign sovereign . . . who has worldwide political interests of his own which may severely clash with the best interests of our country . " <P> Such a view was not surprising among followers of the Saintly German peasant whose ecclesiastical reveries , nailed on a church door at Wittenberg four centuries ago , divided all Germany ( and many another country later ) into Protestant and Catholic political parties . <P> The day after the Lutherans published their resolution , Nominee Smith , in a New Year 's message to U. S. Jewry , published these balanced phrases : " The separation of Church and State is a fundamental American principle . The pursuit of virtue sanctioned by religion is at the basis of any civilized State . . . . " <P> In answer to specific inquiries as to religious affiliations among Governor Smith 's political appointees , New York 's Jewish-descended Secretary . of State , Robert Moses , published the following tabulations : <P> Among 14 Smith cabinet appointments -3 Catholics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other departmental and divisional appointments made by Smith-11 Catholics , 14 Protestants . <P> Among 156 appointments approved by Smith-33 Catholics , 105 Protestants , 11 Jewish descent , 7 undesignated . <P> Among 33 Smith appointments to the judiciary-15 Catholics , 15 Protestants , 3 Jewish descent . <P> Democrats yet more practical called attention to anti-Catholic propaganda of the lowest type and insinuated that the G. O. P. was responsible , if not for starting it , then for not stopping it . New York City 's glib and artful Mayor Walker last week suggested that the Republican-run Post Office Department was deliberately lax about letting " scurrilous slanderous " matter from " fanatical bigots " pass through the mails. * The arch-Democratic New York World reprinted bits from a widely-distributed pamphlet which said : <P> Born <P> On the 28th day of June , 1928 , at Houston , Tex. , <P> The Papal Party of the United States <P> Its Candidate Sir Knight Alfred E. Smith , K. C. , F. F. M.               @ @ @ @ @ @
