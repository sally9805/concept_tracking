Critics speak of Rene Lacoste of France as a tennis machine . If true , he is the strangest machine known to man . William Tatem Tilden II of the U. S. had him two sets to one , and a 3-1 game lead in what looked like the final set , at Wimbledon last week . The machine was making inexplicable errors . But , somehow , by rushing recklessly to the net , the machine brought the set to 4-4 . In the next game was a critical point for which there was a long and terrific volleying . Tilden drove the ball over a far corner of the net ; the machine dived for it , flicked it neatly across the net out of Tilden 's reach . But the machine did not know instantly that it had won that particular point , for it was sprawled in a most unscientific position upon the lawn . <P> Indeed , it was a strange machine that conquered Tilden in the Wimbledon semifinals , 2-6 , 6-3 , 2-6 , 6-4 , 6-3 . The simple explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only machine that Lacoste ever invented was an almost perfect practice machine to return balls to himself . <P> In the finals , Lacoste trounced his countryman , Henri Cochet , who had previously eliminated another U. S. hope , John Hennessey . Britishers who crowded the stadium saw some magnificent tennis , but they also remembered that no Britisher had won the Wimbledon singles since A. W. Gore in 1909 . <P> King-Emperor and Queen-Empress arrived at the stadium in the middle of the women 's finals . Play stopped while Helen Wills stood at attention and Elia de Alvarez bowed . Play resumed and Miss Wills won , 6-2 , 6-3 . <P> British hopes were high only when Gerald Patterson &; John B. Hawkes , of Australia , defeated Tilden and Francis T. Hunter in men 's doubles . But , again France-Henri Cochet &; Jacques Brugnon - conquered the Australians in the finals , 13-11 , 6-5 , 6-4.
