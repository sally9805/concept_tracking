LINKS <P> Joyce Wethered 's , last week , was the voice of three silent years . Because a crowd had pushed and howled at Troon in 1926 when she was playing Glenna Collett she decided to play no more for championship golf cups . It made no difference to her that Mlle. Simone Thion de la Chaume and then Mlle. Manette le Blan thereafter won the British Ladies ' Title . Joyce Wethered , whose impersonality sometimes is tantamount to genteel insolence , plays golf for amusement and crowds do not amuse her . But last week on St. Andrew 's course in Scotland she played again for a championship . Again she met Glenna Collett , again she defeated her . Thus the British Woman 's championship cup preserved its distinction of never having been won by an American . <P> On the morning of the finals , Glenna Collett took fours on every hole of the first nine , except on the eighth where she only had to hit her ball twice . Thus she broke a woman 's record for St. Andrew 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Wethered , after a lunch of salad and cold chicken , had not lost her confident one-sided smile . Her drives were long , her irons had sting . Miss Collett suddenly became nervous , uncertain . Calmly Joyce Wethered advanced to lead . It was on the 15th that she definitely stopped the last Collett attempt to win back the morning 's lead . Glenna Collett had taken a brilliant four . Miss Wethered had to sink an 18-foot putt to halve . She putted . For the first twelve feet the ball rolled so fast that it made a white line on the green . Then it slowed , took minutes and minutes . Finally it dropped into the hole in the turf . Miss Collett managed to halve the next hole but on the 17th she lost . Score : 3 up . 1 to go . When Miss Wethered won her last hole , 100 young girls from St. Andrew 's University , dressed in bright red cloaks , cheered with happy , piping voices . <P> 1,000 Guineas . Back to Moortown . England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME , May 6 ) went U. S. and British professionals last week to play in the Yorkshire Evening News 1,000 guineas ( $5,000 ) tournament . Again , Walter Hagen lost to George Duncan . Leo Diegel won a nickname , " Eagle-Diegel . " Joe Turnesa won the 1,000 guineas from sad-faced Herbert Jolly of England by holing a chip shot for an eagle 3 at the 37th hole . Other spectacular moments : <P> George Duncan won the 36th hole and his match from Walter Hagen by putting 40 feet around a stymie . <P> Leo Diegel scored 30 for his first nine holes while beating Ed Dudley , 5 and 4 . <P> Joe Turnesa beat Britain 's Ernest Whitcombe on the 19th hole ( 19 up , 17 to go ) . <P> W. H. Davies took a 1-up lead on his 7th hole with George Duncan , halved the next eleven holes ( 2 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 2 , 4 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 4 ) , won . <P> Wales . Edward of Wales has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurrying his iron shots , topping drives , putting carelessly . Last week Walter Hagen played with him and said his handicap should be lowered . Explained Hagen : " He plays like a real student of the game , standing right up to the ball and hitting it squarely . He is a deliberate putter . He plays much better than I thought he did .
