I desire to confirm all facts as set ' forth by your correspondent relative to the distressing Hungarian situation . I am obliged . however . to ask you to be kind enough to c:ear up the folios : lug misunderstanding caused by an unintentional err Or in minting my views : I was erroneously reported as having held the view that the ? ? Li tile Entente will have to take steps to end the reactionary rule in Hungary . " As a loyal Hungarian I must emphasize that I do not consider it to be the function of the Little Entente to take any steps In any political matter relating to Hungary , because the Little Entente has no business to interfere with the internal affairs of Hungary . The Hungarian people deserve better leaders . other than the present corrupt gang of counterfeiters which is holding the reins at Budapest . It is my sincere belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep the terrorists from office , and that the longoverdue collapse of the notorious Horthy regime will be accemplIshed In the near future . 1 I beg of you to publish these lines in the Interest of preventing any misunderstanding in Hungarian circles .
