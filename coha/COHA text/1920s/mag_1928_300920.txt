If we 've nothing in particular to do . . . <P> . . . We help a fellow creature on his path . <P> With the Garter* or the Thistle+ or the Bath . . . . ** <P> Then we possibly create a peer or two ! <P> The King of Barataria <P> Gilbert &; Sullivan <P> <P> No peers were created by the King-Emperor , last week , but George V , perhaps with " nothing in particular to do , " did bestow the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of The Thistle upon the father of the most popular young woman in England . The young woman is Elizabeth Duchess of York , only daughter-in-law of His Majesty , and mother of the nationally adored " Baby Betty . " <P> The new Knight of the Thistle is the Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne , Claud George Bowes-Lyon , a descendant of Scottish kings far more ancient in lineage than is Britain 's Royal House . The Earl , pious and as Scotch as the Thistle itself , is at pains to uphold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord , have I put my trust . <P> Orchards are his hobby . A few years ago he would climb nimbly up many a tree , personally inspecting branches that might need pruning . Even now , at 73 , he ministers to favorite trees from the ground , with a long pruning-saw , much resembling a medieval spear . As he prowls , thus accoutred , around his excessively historic Glamis Castle , romantic persons enjoy fancying that the Earl resembles an early owner of his domain , King Macbeth of Scotland ( reigned 1040-57 ) , who , as Shakespeare has told , murdered King Duncan in Glamis Castle . <P> Sir Walter Scott , when he slept there for a night , fancied that ghosts came eerily to mock at him ; but Elizabeth Duchess of York has explicitly scoffed at all such " stuff and nonsense . " <P> Some three centuries after Macbeth 's death , King Robert II of Scotland begot a daughter from Elizabeth Mure ( first mistress , later queen ) , married the girl to doughty John Lyon , gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbroken line . Succeeding ancestors were created Baron Glamis ( Scotch Creation , 1445 ) , Lord Glamis ( English Creation , 1606 ) , Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne , 1677 , and Baron Bowes ( United Kingdom Creation , 1887 ) . All these titles of course reside in the present Premier Peer of Scotland , 14th Earl of Strathmore , Claud George Bowes-Lyon . <P> As is usual every Autumn , members of the Bowes-Lyon family were fishing for sporty salmon , last week , in the famed River Spey . Among titled Spey fisher-women the Duchess of York ranks well ; but she is admittedly surpassed by Super-Fishermaiden Miss Rachel Spender-Clay , a niece of Viscount &; Viscountess Astor . During the week Miss Spender-Clay distinguished herself still further by announcing her engagement to the Duchess ' youngest brother , the Hon. David Bowes-Lyon , probably the worst salmon fisherman in his distinguished family . <P> Since childhood David Bowes-Lyon has enjoyed the occult reputation of possessing second sight . This was most strikingly demonstrated when he absolutely refused to believe official War Office statements that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seer David : " Michael is not dead .
