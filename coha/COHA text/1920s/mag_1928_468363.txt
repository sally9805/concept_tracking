ANYONE even slightly familiar with American sport will inform you , lawn tennis in this , the twenty-eighth year of the Davis Cup , is in a febrile condition . One of the most important amateur sports , as well as one of the most interesting of games both to watch and to play , it has been for years in a state of increasing unhealthiness while hundreds of thousands of its followers look on with amazed astonishment . They wonder vaguely who is responsible for this condition . Although more people than ever are playing tennis in private clubs and public parks , the heart has gone out of the competitive end of the game . That feeling of sport for the sake of the sport which was such a characteristic of tennis and its champions of twenty years ago has been succeeded by a spirit of commercialism , wrangling , and suspicion . Rumors of this and of that float through the air , charges and counter-charges by famous players and prominent officials are exchanged until the bewildered public has n't the faintest idea who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what is more , the public does n't care . It is getting disgusted with the game as it is to-day . Why has this happened ? In a word , what is the matter with tennis in 1928 ? " Does Tilden get paid for going into these tournaments ? " That is a question I am frequently asked by onlookers uncertain of his exact status . It is an easily answered question . No Mr. Tilden does not receive money for playing in tournaments . What , then , about the lords paramountof the game : the President , the Vice-President , the Chairmen of Committees of the United States Lawn Tennis Association ? the rulers of lawn tennis ? Do they get salaries for their services ? So far as I am aware , not a penny . Then they give their time and their efforts for nothing ? They arc generous and public-spirited citizens interested only in the furthering of amateur sport throughout the nation ? Well ? not exactly . For the plain fact is that ninety per cent of the regular tournament players , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis industry , are no more concerned with the furthering of amateur sport than is Mr. Tex Rickard or Mr. C. C. Pyle . They are in tennis ? this sport which was formerly a sport for amateurs and the most amateur of sports ? for what they can get out of it . Needless to say , they do n't admit this . On the contrary , they utter lofty protestations of the time they have given up , the sacrifices they have made , the efforts they have spent to assist lawn tennis . But there is something a little hollow about these protestations . I have yet to find many men closely connected with the game who have lost financially through their association with it . Just as a symptom of the state of lawn tennis , let us consider the case of Mr. Julian S. Myrick of New York . Mr. Myrick first became identified with tennis Iong before the War , when the West Side Tennis Club , of which he is such an illustrious member , was located at 238th Street , Manhattan . Polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Myrick is an affable dinner companion , an able and shrewd executive who has spent years of hard work in organizing , directing , and promoting the game of tennis . That he has been of immense value to the sport both in this country and abroad even his enemies ? of whom he has plenty ? would , I think , willingly admit . To appreciate his services to the full you have but to go back to the time when the national singles championships were played at Newport , Rhode Island . This was prior to the early years of the War , and the biggest tennis event of the country was in the hands of a group of men as roundly attacked for unfairness as are the present-day executives of the Association . Nor were those attacks , any more than the attacks of to-day , entirely unwarranted . Newport was the playground of society ; few people could attend the national championships ; many players were unwilling or unable to attend them for obvious reasons . It was , I believe , largely through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Newport in 1915 and brought down to Forest Hills , where it was given to the West Side Tennis Club and where it has been held ever since , except for the years when it was played at Philadelphia . Before Mr. Myrick 's time a man seen on the street with a tennis racquet was sure to be bombarded with a chorus of " forty love " in high falsetto tones from every urchin in the immediate vicinity . To-day you can carry a tennis racquet in the street as safely as a Chicago gunman carries a pistol . And the galleries flock out to Forest Hills , crowd the stands , take off their coats , and give vent to their feelings in the most approved baseball fashion . I shall never forget the look upon Ren ? Lacoste 's face after his victory over Bill Johnston in the semi-final round of the National Singles Championships last fall at Forest Hills , when after the last point he was greeted by an avalanche of cushions from above . Lawn tennis has been democratized ; but the gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , can not be charged to Mr. Myrick . His efforts in bringing tennis to a place where it was within reach of the crowd , his long years of service as referee and official at the biggest meeting of the season , his energy and endeavors for the good of the game ? all this is sometimes forgotten by those who dismiss him contemptuously as " the Tzar . " " I remember Mr. Myrick as the only man at West Side with the authority and the organizing ability to run a big championship tournament as it should be run , " said an old member of the club to me the other day . Nor is this the limit of his achievements . Soon after the fight which brought the tennis championships to Forest Hills he was made President of the West Side Club , the largest and probably one of the most important tennis clubs in the country . From this it was but a step in 1918 to the Vice-Presidency of the National Tennis Association . When Mr. George T. Adee , the President , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Myrick ran the tennis of the country . After being Vice-President in 1918 and 1919 he was rewarded with the Presidency in 1920 . As President of the United States Lawn Tennis Association Mr. Myrick gave dignity and authority to the role ; he seized the part as a fine actor seizes the lead in a play and holds it firmly to the last curtain . His term as President ran until 19M there are those who assert that he has not yet Iost control even though he no longer holds office . Since the War tennis has broadened and developed in many ways , and much of the credit must , go to Mr. Myrick . The placing of the game upon a firm financial footing , the spread of tournament tennis throughout the nation , the cordial relationships maintained with other countries , the increase in interest in the matches for the Davis Cup , that deft and subtle touch of having the draw made annually at the White House ? these and other things too numerous to mention were products of Mr. Myrick 's fertile and resourceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means read the entire roll call of his services to the cause of lawn tennis ? Mr. Myrick has done a vast amount for the sport . And now let us see what the game of tennis has done for Mr. Myrick . Properly to appreciate this you must know something about the constitution and make-up of the United States Lawn Tennis Association , of which Mr. Myrick is to-day the directing genius . To the Association belong the various tennis and country clubs throughout the country , which ? theoretically at any rate ? elect officers and an Executive Committee at the annual meeting each winter . Actually , there is a good deal of controlled proxy voting and not a little politics going on every year behind the scenes . It is true to say that tennis in this country is ruled by the Executive Committee , and it is almost true to say that Mr. Myrick is the Committee . For he is one of the oldest. , probably one of the most influential , and certainly one of the most active members . Now this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with eighteen annually elected delegates and the ex-Presidents of the Association . It is this provision which enables Mr. Myrick to keep his firm band upon the tennis affairs of the nation . In addition , a joker is thrown in by which seven members , including officers , form a quorum of this cumbersome committee . You will perceive that Mr. Goss , the Delegate from Portland , Oregon , and Mr. Lawton , the Delegate from Tucson , Arizona , and Mr. Adoue , the Delegate from Dallas , Texas , have not much chance of being present at a meeting in New York , while Mr. Adec , Mr. Slocum , and Mr. Mersereau , all ex-Presidents , are within a stone 's throw of Mr. Myrick 's office . The importance of this committee will ie understood when it is learned that it sas supervision over all the tournaments n this country , charge of all funds of the Association , control of all expenditures . Once again , tennis is ruled by the Executive Committee , and no unimportant part of the Committee is Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Myrick and the other members get no money directly from the game . They are not paid for their services as officers of the Association or members of the Executive Committee . Their positions arc honorary as well as onerous . No , they do not graft . The " gravy " to be derived from this amateur sport comes in another and far more subtle way . The benefit that Mr. Myrick and the other gentlemen connected with the administration of lawn tennis obtain comes from one thing and one thing alone ? publicity . In fact , the story of how this game has degenerated from one of the most amateur of sports until it has become a grab bag for players and officials alike is in some respects the story of what Americans will do to secure publicity . To be conspicuously successful to-day you must roar and roar louder than the next man . Is it necessary to suggest that those who have been clever enough to do their roaring through the medium of amateur sport are not usually to be found in the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how this works out you have but to follow the progress of Mr. Myrick : twenty-five years ago an insurance agent with a small office in lower New York , to-day the General Agent for one of the largest insurance companies in the United States , with a battalion of clerks , a large suite of rooms , and a corner sanctum within sight of Wall and Broad Streets , Manhattan , That he has achieved this entirely through his connection with tennis is , of course , absurd . Mr. Myrick is an able and astute business man who would probably have made money had the game never existed . But that his alliance with sport year after year has not been made at any great finaneial sacrifice is also , it seems to me , indisputable . As President of the West Side Tennis Club , as President of the U. S. L. T. A. , as chairman of this committee and member of that committee , he was naturally enough thrown into contact with a class of men who could hardly fail to be of help to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more direct than that . For under his guidance the U. S. L. T. A. established an office with a paid secretariat and clerical force , the money to support all this coming from the annual dues paid by tennis clubs and moneys received each year from big tournaments . From this office emanates the publicity , the press releases sent out with great frequency to the newspapers of the country to keep them informed regarding events in the world of tennis ? and interesting they are , these releases . Mr. Myrick does not get the worst of the breaks . Thus during the past year some seventy releases were issued ; twenty-five , or one in three , mentioned Mr. Myrick in one way or another . For his connections with official tennis are many and varied . In 1927 he was a member of the Executive Committee , a member of the Advisory and Finance Committee , the Chairman of the Davis Cup Committee , a member of the Men 's National Singles Championship Committee , a member of the Amateur Rule Committee and of the Honorary- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be for propaganda to issue from the offices of the Association without Mr. Myrick 's name being mentioned in one capacity or another . And there is also the question of aid to the eye as well as to the mind . Scan closely the rotogravure sections of the newspapers in the past few years and you will probably observe , between bathing girls in Florida and scenes at St. Moritz , Mr. Myrick greeting the lady champion on her arrival from her successful trip to Europe , Mr. Myrick presenting a new challenge cup to the college boys , Mr. Myrick ( third from left ) at the annual draw for the Davis Cup at the White House , Mr. Myrick shaking hands with Bishop Manning during the tennis matches for the Sports Bay of the Cathedral , Mr. Myrick presiding as referee of the Davis Cup contest , and so forth and so forth . In other words , what Mr. Myrick has received through tennis is just what our great national advertisers like General Motors and Ivory Soap have spent millions to secure . And he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one cynical observer has remarked : " Mike gets the publicity , and tennis pays the bills ! " Certainly the first part of this statement can not be questioned . Does publicity pay ? Let a gentleman in Mr. Myrick 's own business , the head of a great insurance concern , express his opinion . " At a conservative estimate I figure the publicity Mr. Myrick has received as worth fifty thousand dollars a year . " Whether or not this is correct , what Mr. Myrick would have to pay if he went to one of the highly organized publicity agencies who specialize in these things is a matter of figures . A friend of mine who works in one of the biggest of such firms in lower Broadway tells me that a fee of twenty-five thousand dollars a year for securing the equivalent of the notice which Mr. Myrick receives through tennis would be a moderate figure . Publicity does n't help ? Tell that to one of the aforementioned national advertisers . And let me suggest how much more valuable the indirect publicity of a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus an occasional picture in the rotogravure section , can be than advertising space bought and paid for by cash . Yes , publicity helps . And in so far as Mr. Myrick is concerned it is fairly apparent , as the cynical gentleman remarked , that tennis pays the bills . " Absurd , all that , " the friends of Mr. Myrick will reply . " Why , he has lost thousands of dollars annually through his devotion to sport . " I , too , have heard such comments , have even had il stated for me in dollars and cents . One THE LAWN TENNIS INDUSTRY ess man close to Mr. Myrick has estimated his deficit at twenty thousand a year , and that is doubtless an accurate figure . But even deducting the twenty thousand lost from the fifty thousand dollars ' worth of publicity received , you have the tidy sum of thirty thousand dollars a year , representing the financial value to him of his connection with this amateur sport ; let us say approximately three hundred thousand in the ten years since 1918 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten short years ago . Mr. Myrick was then the rebel , the insurgent , the bad boy of lawn tennis , destroying tradition , despoiling the game from Newport , its first and its natural home . He was then an outsider . To-day he is the devoted friend of the men he once fought so bitterly ; to-day he is in the seats of the mighty . May I , therefore , be forgiven for presuming that , despite his devotion to the cause of amateur sport , of which unquestionably he has been one of the foremost upholders , his bread cast upon the water of tennis has come rolling generously back ? " Attacking me has become a college sport lately ; I 'm used to it , " said Mr. Myrick grimly to me one afternoon last fall . The gentleman who has done most of the attacking is none other than our former national champion , Mr. William T. Tilden , end . Like Mr. Myrick , Mr. Tilden has done a vast amount for the game of tennis . He has given earnestly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sport . He has sometimes paid his way to appear at exhibition matches ; he has assisted younger players in parts of the country where good tennis is seldom seen . But to realize the extent of his influence one must be in touch with sporting circles abroad . I do not think it an exaggeration to say that his name and his personality are familiar in parts of Europe where Mr. Coolidge and Mr. Ford are rarely heard of or mentioned . He is looked upon as the greatest player of all time , the hero of the sport in every far , forgotten corner of the world where tennis is played ? and where is it not played to-day ? To say that he has had a greater influence upon the game than anyone in the past or present is certainly not an overstatement . Since both men are born rulers and both intend to rule , it is natural that Mr. Tilden and Mr. Myrick should not get on together . That the two would clash was almost inevitable . Mr. Tilden is an individualist , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has never eared to have anyone else do it for him . Soon after his rise to fame he became disgusted with the politics and chicanery which he found in tennis . And he said so . He has been , it is true , tactless at times , but he has usually said exactly what he thought . He has , moreover , contended that he has received unfair treatment at the hands of the rulers of the game , treatment which amounted to persecution . Occasionally this persecution has had its amusing side . There was the question of Mr. Tilden upon the stage . Was he or was he not a professional ? Once his friend and admirer , Mr. Samuel Merwin the novelist , asked him to take part in an amateur production of " Clarence " put on by the worthies of Concord , Massachusetts , Mr. Merwin 's native heath . The U. S. L. T. A. on hearing of it , went so far as to send a committee to witness the performance to see just how far , if at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the performance the most prejudiced observer had to admit that he was still an amateur ! Yet even if discrimination has been practiced against him , it seems to me that , in the English sense of the word , Mr. Tilden 's professionalism is unquestionable . Needless to say , I am not claiming that Mr. Tilden has ever taken money for playing tennis . That is beside the question . What I do assert is that Mr. Tilden professes tennis as a doctor professes medicine or a lawyer professes law . I mean that life to Mr. Tilden is tennis , that he eats , breathes , sleeps , and thinks tennis . That tennis is his be-all and end-all . In fact , how anyone could be more of a professional in this sense than he is I am at a loss to understand . Follow the former champion through a typical year , and you may perceive what I wish to convey . The year 1927 , for instance , found him , in January , giving exhibitions in places as scattered as Hartford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in San Francisco . Another dash across the continent and he played in the Southern Florida Championships at Miami , Florida , on the 28th of that month . The week of March 7th he played in Palm Beach , the week of the 14th in Jacksonville , the week of the 21st in Ormond Beach , the week of the 28th in Augusta , Georgia . On April the 4th he played in Asheville , North Carolina , the week of the 11th at Pinehurst ; and three days after this tournament was over , on the 21st , he was sailing from New York as a member of the team sent abroad by the U. S. L. T. A. to play in Europe . On the 6th , 7th , and 8th of May he played in Berlin in a team match against Germany ; on the 10th , 11th , and 12th against Holland at Amsterdam . The 13th , 14th , and 15th of May he was pitted against the Belgians at Brussels ; he played against the French in Paris on the 19th , 20th , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Championships began , lasting until the 4th of June . Thence to Ireland where a team match was played at Belfast against Ulster on the 9th , to Dublin for a match against the Free State on the 10th , 11th , and 12th , and to Manchester where a team match was played against England on the 16th , 17th , and 18th . The British Championships took place at Wimbledon between the 20th of June and the 2nd of July . Mr. Tilden landed in New York on the 14th . On the 15th he was playing in Providence , Rhode Island , during the week of the 18th at Detroit , Michigan , the week of the 25th at Chicago , Illinois , the week of August 1st at Seabright , New Jersey . The week of the 8th he was at Southampton and , after a few days at Forest Hills for the Davis Cup trials , he spent the week of the 22nd at Newport and the next week playing in the doubles championships at Longwood , Massachusetts . The 8th , 9th , and 10th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the next week he sojourned at Forest Hills at the National Singles Championship . After this event you might imagine that Mr. Tilden had had enough sport for one year . Not at all . On the 20th he was back in harness at Chicago , and on the 5th of October he had flitted as far as Los Angeles , California . If a player who pursues the game in this manner from week to week , year in year out , does not profess tennis , what in heaven 's name does he do ? Surely no high-powered executive of big business , no politician , no corporation lawyer could work more fervently at his profession than Mr. Tilden does . Now what chance have ordinary players who are obliged to earn a living , like Mr. Watson Washburn or Mr. It . N. Williams , players who can spend but a few weeks a year in active competition , against a man who plays all the time as Mr. Tilden does ? And is it necessary to say that during these weeks Mr. Tilden 's expenses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied by the various clubs where he plays or by the U. S. L. T. A. ? I am reminded of a chance remark dropped by a famous woman player who was asked whether she contemplated turning professional . " Why should I ? " she replied . " I go from one tournament to another every week with all my expenses paid . It would cost me fifteen thousand dollars a year to live as I do , and I do n't happen to have an income of fifteen thousand . " There is a name for such people . It was first coined , I think , in Great Britain . They are called ? these gentry who are neither professionals nor amateurs ? by the delightful name of " shamateurs . " There is no reason for Mr. Tilden to turn professional , because he has far too good a time as a " shamateur . " And if he has no well-organized publicity service at his behest , he has something far better , a mighty racquet . Let him but lift this racquet ? until lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the most marvellous tennis player the world had ever seen . In a recent biographical sketch Mr. Tilden described himself as a " litterateur and actor . " Does a reputation of this sort diminish his demand as a writer of fiction ? Hardly . Does it prevent him from finding a manager to stage his plays or keep the curious public eager to see a tennis-champion-actor from attending them ? Not exactly . If Mr. Tilden is n't a " debtor to his profession , " as a wise man put it three hundred years ago , what , precisely , is he then ? No , like Mr. Myrick he can hardly come forward and claim that his manifold services and sacrifices for the game of tennis have been made without any reward . HI In discussing tennis and the Iow estate to which it has recently fallen I have treated so far only the two most prominent figures in the game , the leading official and the leading player . But it would be most unjust to them and - unfair to their colleagues and confreres to convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly not the fact . What they have done in a large way a host of imitators have done in a small way . These enterprising gentlemen run all the way down the scale to the youthful hope from college who pads his expense account as much or as little as he thinks he can get away with . There was the nationally known tennis star who shortly after he ascended to prominence made the remark , " I 'm going to get mine out of this ! " He attached himself to a life-insurance company and , at the annual meeting of the U. S. L. T. A. a few months later , he nstalled himself at the doorway of the lining room , openly soliciting everyone who entered . There are the men who do the umpiring at the large national tournaments ; glance over the list and you will find that ninety per cent peddle real estate , bonds , or insurance ; something , in a word , that renders the publicity they receive from tennis extremely useful in a business way . They all have something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few admit it , freely and frankly . One of the best of all umpires and one of the first to take up umpiring in a semiprofessional manner , granted as much when the question was put to him directly . " Did tennis help me in my business ? I 'll say so ! " It reminds me of an expression of a well-known player who remarked some years ago in a private conversation , " From now on I 'm going to play practical tennis . " Practical tennis ! A priceless expression . Was ever a phrase so full of meaning ? Others besides myself will testify that this " well-known net star " has played practical tennis and played it well . Among those who will bear me out is the chairman of the tournament committee of an Eastern club . This gentleman , during a big meeting , came across our practical tennis-player in the act of drawing up an expense account . It so happened that the chairman was not devoid of a sense of humor , and looking over , said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction ! " Have I conveyed the impression that only man is vile ? That is not so . Mademoiselle Suzanne Lenglen was a professional long before she became one in the newspapers , as she herself told us at the time of her conversion . Nor was the French Association entirely ignorant of her status . A man high in French tennis circles said to me several years ago when she was playing internationally for her country , " We know perfectly well she is a professional . Have we not a file ? soso ? big ? But what can we do ? After all she is our champion . " Delightfully French . Yes , but they were more severe upon Miss Wills when she visited the Riviera several winters ago . Her voyage , as she gave out , was a trip to study Art . Like Mr. Tilden , however , she benefited from proffered hospitality . By playing in tennis tournaments each week during January , February , and March she and her mother were enabled to enjoy the luxuries and the best suites of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cannes . In fact , so steadfast was her devotion to tennis and so open was her desertion of Art that one malicious French journal wrote a supposititious interview upon her departure , quoting her as having said , " Yes , I 've been perfectly delighted with my stay upon the Riviera , I 've made one little sketch and have played tennis only to amuse myself and quite by chance . For before everything I 'm an art student . " And why did the Grand Palace Hotels offer Miss Wills and her mother a salon , a bedroom , and bath , " en plein Midi " ? First of all , because it is an excellent thing for the hotel business to have tennis champions " chez nous . " And also because most of the big hotels run tennis clubs as an adjunct , and each club holds a tournament each season . With Miss Wills appearing , a gate of thirty to fifty thousand francs was assured . Without her presence a deficit of anything up to ten thousand francs was equally certain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennis Club of Monte Carlo , told me that several years ago when Mademoiselle Lenglen , vexed with the club authorities , refused to perform at their tournament , her absence cost the club nearly fifty thousand francs . I remember a delightful incident which took place in the club office that year in my hearing . An elderly English lady came in and asked Mr. Henley for seats for the tournament which began the following week . The tickets were handed to her and the Secretary said , " That will be a hundred francs , please . " The lady gave him the hundred-franc note and remarked casually , " What day is Mademoiselle Lenglen playing ? " " Mademoiselle Lenglen is n't playing this year . " " Ah ? then I wo n't take the seats after all . " And she held out her hand for the hundred-franc note . The Secretary was used to this , and smiled ruefully at me as she went out . In five minutes , however , she was back again . " Will Mademoiselle Lenglen be over to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , we are saving seats for her on Friday afternoon . " " Friday ? Then will you please give me two seats for that afternoon . " You will appreciate this question of the gate receipts and how they operate when you come to analyze the financial problems that the tennis clubs must meet . For instance , the West Side Tennis Club of Forest Hills , N. Y. , was in 1922 one of the largest , most important , and influential tennis clubs in the country . It was in a prosperous condition , owning valuable property free and clear save for a small mortgage and possessed of a sinking fund of almost fifty thousand dollars . The club was persuaded to enter into an agreement to build a stadium for the big matches , this operation to he financed by the selling of ten-year seats to privileged subscribers at a hundred dollars apiece . The contribution of the club was to be limited to the surrender of its land for the Stadium and courts and the use of the clubhouse during the week of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been expected , whereas fewer ten-year seats were sold than was hoped . As a result a cash balance of ten thousand dollars , the entire sinking fund , and a mortgage of a hundred and fifty thousand were swallowed up without meeting the total cost of the Stadium . Someone had to foot the bill . Eventually the club was able to borrow a tidy sum from the U. S. L. T. A. to help matters along . ( This , by the way , explains the expression in tennis circles to the effect that " West Side is in hock to the National Association . " ) But with this enormous sum at stake some revenue is imperative . The proceeds from the big tournament , instead of being a nice little nest egg to add each year to the sinking fund , are absolutely necessary to pay off interest on the mortgage . And what is true of West Side is true to a lesser degree of almost every tennis club in the country . For certainly all the large ones depend upon the revenue from tournaments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our club . Why ? Because if they do not I play there will be no interesting matches , and if there are no interesting matches there will be no crowds to watch , and if there are no crowds to watch there will be no gate , and if there is no gate there will be a deficit in the club treasury and the mortgage will be foreclosed . Et voila ! The good players are catered to , their services are sought , with the natural result that they are in a position to dictate , and the chairmen of tournament committees may know the players are " writing fiction , " and yet be powerless to act . It makes more than ever tart the half-humorous , half-annoyed ejaculation of Doe Kelton , the genial promotr of the first professional tournament field in the United States last fall in New York . Some of the professional players ' ntering in the tournament came to him m the opening day and asked where he as going to put them up . " Where am I going to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Say , that do you fellows think you are , a lot . f amateurs ? " And yet when all is said and done you cannot condemn the amateur tennis layers entirely . For they observe with merest Lite overlords of the game ? bond ealers , real estate men , and insurance rchdukes ? making profits out of tennis cite beyond the reach of the average layer . Can they be censured when they and by and watch stadiums built , businesses expand and grow , associations flourish , while thousands of dollars change hands before their faces mostly as the result of their efforts upon the courts ? Iv No one , I think , who knows sport from within , will deny that there has been of late years a steady tendency toward professionalism in tennis . And no one will deny that this is bad , not only for tennis but for American sport in general . It is bad simply because it means mixing two things that should never be mixed ? sport and business . So far as I am aware no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major J. C. S. Rendall of Gleneagles , Scotland , merely because they happen to be professional instructors of tennis . Nor does anyone think the less of Richards and Kinsey because they have become what the French so expressively call " **31;768;TOOLONG . " No more can Mr. Tilden be looked at askance if he wishes to make money out of tennis . Indeed , if he is able to command a thousand dollars for an afternoon 's match , surely his tennis , the greatest the world has ever seen , is worth that much . Let him make his thousand dollars , freely , frankly , openly . There is no more disgrace in making money out of tennis than in making money out of the stock exchange or the automobile industry . The disgrace of the present condition of tennis in the United States ? and this seems to have been overlooked lately by players and associations alike ? lies in this mixing of supposedly amateur sport and business . In using sport as a means to personal ends . In pretending to be one thing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amateur and actually being a shamateur . In bootlegging amateur sport . Last year at the time of the professional foray Ted by Mr. Pyle , leaders of tennis officialdom in the United States affected to think that this exhibition nonsense could hurt amateur tennis . But the only thing that can hurt amateur tennis is this false amateurism which simply covers a professionalism of the most virulent sort . Thirty years ago lawn tennis was the most amateur of games . It was played by men who cared for the sport and would n't have understood you had you suggested that there was something in it for them individually . If they went to a tournament they paid their own fare by train ; they put up at the house of a friend or went to a hotel on their own . Gates , as we know them , did not exist . Publicity , press releases , associations were all unknown . The men who ran tennis were amateurs of the amateur . Doctor Dwight , Palmer Presbrey , Richard Stevens , R. D. Sears : their interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest of those closely connected with tennis is to-day I have attempted to show in this article . Could anything be more of a con-trast ? " Of course the English ca n't expect to win , " said a casual observer of sport recently in commenting on American sporting victories during the past year ; " they 're amateurs . " This is significant as showing bow the average onlooker regards all the noise and furor made over our international sporting supremacy .
