" Politics ! Dirty politics ! " cried the Democratic politicians of Manhattan when 18 liquorous Manhattan night clubs were Federally raided at the very moment Governor Smith of New York was being nominated for the Presidency ( TIME , July 9 ) . The raids continued , prosecutions began and the fact came out that the Manhattan mop-up had been personally planned by Mrs. Mabel Walker Willebrandt , U. S. Assistant Attorney General . Much of able Mrs. Willebrandt 's energy has been exerted this year towards getting Mr. Hoover nominated and elected . " Politics ! Dirty politics ! " was a convincing cry . <P> Last week , to stop the cry , Assistant Prohibition Commissioner Alf Oftedal , acting in the absence of Commissioner James M. Doran , announced that Federal enforcement officers everywhere had been cautioned to refrain from spectacular raids which might in any way be thought politically motivated . This announcement came only a day or two after Nominee Hoover 's return to Washington . <P> " Oho , " said Democrats , " Mr. Hoover has sat upon Mrs. Willebrandt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too far or in the wrong direction . New York is the biggest of the States , and hard enough to Hooverize , without annoying it . Mr. Hoover has thanked Mrs. Willebrandt and he has also ' spanked ' her . . . etc. , etc . " <P> Indignant , Mrs. Willebrandt spoke up for herself . " It is preposterous , " she said , " that Mr. Hoover or any other candidate for a high and dignified office such as the Presidency of the United States would presume to control a public officer in the discharge of official duties . Mr. Hoover has not done so and would not do so . The conduct of my official duties was not discussed with Mr. Hoover . "
