TIE new psychology appears to be making a discovery , the first promise of which is not yet perceived , even by the psychologists . This discovery is difficult to state , both because it is not yet fully made , and because it concerns he human mind , about which we know so little that we have not even words to express that little precisely . I will , therefore , ask the reader to forgive me if my statement fails to satisfy him . It is being made in the effort to cure certain mental disorders , such as those which are called phobias . The phobia , it appears , has its origin in the mental history of the patient , in some shock or other mischance which he has forgotten . The fact that he has forgotten the origin is itself part of the cause of the phobia ; and , if the origin can by some means be discovered and made known to the patient , then he will be able to cure himself of the phobia . The whole process , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like putting a machine in order , except that the machine knows that it is out of order and rights itself by becoming aware of the origin of its disorder . The healing knowledge comes from outside , from the psychoanalyst , yet it also comes as knowledge to the patient . It is absorbed mentally , just as medicine is absorbed physically ; and then , like medicine , it works , the patient can not tell how , but still mentally . Now , as I have said , the full promise of this discovery is not commonly per- I ceived , even by psychologists ; for , in the first place , they have not yet in. sisted that it can be extended to the errors and moral perversities of normal people ; and , in the second , they are often prevented by certain unconscious assumptions of their own from seeing what a new light it throws upon the whole problem of evil . These two points are closely connected with each other , so that the first will lead me naturally to the second . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ex. tension of the discovery to the errors and perversities of normal people . We are all aware , or should he , that our common method of dealing with each other 's errors , namely , by con. troversy , is not successful ; its failure is well expressed in the lines : ? That is to say , a man convinced against his will is not convinced . Indeed , you can not convince him of any error , thoroughly established in his mind , by a rational process ; for the error itself was not established by a rational process . The psychoanalysts , when they deal with a phobia , are aware of this . They do not argue with a patient , do not tell him that it is absurd to he afraid of edged tools or of open smees , or what not . They know that argil. ment in such cases is like rubbing a sore : it only makes the patient more aware of his disorder , and so more ton- vineed of its reality . The psychoanalyst 's method is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to place it in the category of disease , not in that of reason ; and to tell the patient how it has come about . Then , for the patient also , it passes out of the category of reason into that of disease ; and , when he knows the cause of it , it becomes to him something finite , mechanical , external , and so loses its intimidating power over him . Instead of classing it with madness , he classes it with toothache ; and this very classification , by separating it , as it were , from the whole system of his mind , is itself a cure . Thus it is that we should deal with error , both in others and , finally , in ourselves . We should , to begin with , understand that the processes by which truth and error establish themselves in the mind are different ; and , wherever se find error firmly established , we should seek for the cause of it and explain that cause to the person who is in error . Argument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it treats error as if it were of the same nature as truth , takes it seriously , and assumes its origin to be rational . Further , when we attack a man 's errors by argument , ao enlist all his self-love in defense of them . They are to him part of himself ; but , if he is to renounce them , he must he persuaded that they are not part of himself , but an accident that has happened to him , like a phobia . Opinions or beliefs , once very firmly held , often vanish from our minds , without our knowing why or how they have vanished . We may think that some argument has destroyed them , and there wonder why we have seen the force of this argument at last , when we have been familiar with it so long without heeding it . In such cases the argument is usually a mere summons to surrender : the battle has really been fought , and the victory won , in the unconscious ; for the cause of our belief has , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained only until challenged . The cause of a false belief is really an obstacle to perception of the truth , and , that obstacle removed , the truth is seen . At present , this removal of obstacles is often a matter of chance ; but the discovery of the new psychology should help us to effect it deliberately , in ourselves and in others . The mere knowledge that there may be causes of our dearest beliefs , unknown to ourselves , should set us examining those beliefs with a new and more critical curiosity ; for there is not one of us that really wishes to believe nonsense . We believe it because some particular credulity in our minds makes it appear to be sense ; and credulity is always particular , not general ; it is a tendency to believe , not any nonsense , but some favorite kind of nonsense . For it has always a particular cause ; and , when once that is discovered , the beliefs in which the credulity expresses itself do not need to be argued with : they have lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the melody of which has turned to stale sentimentality . Yet , even when we have discovered the cause of a credulity , we seldom connect that discovery with the resulting change of belief . The change works in the unconscious , just as a patient is cured of a phobia without seeing how he is cured . Suppose , for instance , that you believe more ill about someone than is true . That is because you have a readiness to believe ill about him ? a credulity on that point for which there is a cause , not a reason . The credulity means a resentment against him , which , like a phobia , has power over you just because you are not aware of its cause . But then , suppose you suddenly become aware , by some means , SOO EVIL AND THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY of the cause of this resentment ? as that he has wounded your vanity , or has caused you some loss of income , or that for some reason you are afraid of him . This cause you have hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could do so only by rationalizing it ; that is to say by believing that the man 's actions and character justified it . But , the moment you are aware of the cause , the resentment itself loses its charm for you and is reduced to its proper proportions . Though , perhaps , the man has really behaved ill to you , your pleasure will no longer be in your anger , but rather in trying to be just in spite of it . You will judge yourself for your resentment , as well as him for provoking it . Your whole state of mind toward him will have lost its prestige and you will see it as having , not a reason , but a cause which it is your business to remove . Resentments are just like phobias in this , that they are greatest and most dangerous to right thinking and feeling when the cause of them is unknown ; then the mind is poisoned by them , as the body by a festering , covered wound . So , if you find yourself thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may be sure that it has an unknown cause . Find the cause , and you will isolate the resentment from the rest of your mind . You will see it in its danger and ugliness , and have the will to rid yourself of it . We all have within us a will to be sane , and it acts as soon as we become aware of the caused insanity of any of our beliefs , of the feelings which make us credulous ; for the beliefs are but a rationalizing of the feelings . And this is true , not only of particular errors , such as we can detect in each other when we do not share them , but also of collective beliefs held by great masses of people , such as nations , or even by whole generations of every nation . The way to destroy these also is , not to argue with them , but to discover their cause and state it clearly . Only so can their prestige be destroyed , If , for instance , it can be shown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priesthood in its own professional interests , then it will lose its prestige for the laity , and even for the priesthood . Or if it can be shown that the whole doctrine of laissez-faire had its cause in the desire of people with capital to get every possible advantage from their capital without doing violence to their consciences , then that doctrine also will lose its prestige , even for them . But in all such cases the cause must be discovered and stated with precision , so that it will be clear , even to unwilling minds . Then it will gradually and unconsciously work its effect upon them , and they will find themselves no longer able to believe what they have believed , for their own comfort . It is impossible for us to believe anything for our comfort , as soon as we know that that is why we have been believing it . The process of comforting belief must be unconscious . To make us conscious of it is to end it . Behind most , if not all , of our common and persistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of the nature of phobias , though the fear , being an entirely negative and , therefore , unpleasant feeling , disguises itself in some more positive form . And even beliefs not altogether erroneous are constantly tainted and perverted by an element of fear . For instance , the belief in God and the belief in itnmortality have , all through the ages , been perverted by fear ; in fact our minds are infested with inherited and habitual phobias , against which , hitherto , ne have had no defense , since we were not even aware of the distinction between them and rational beliefs , or that in // that distinction lay the promise of a cure . But now the promise has dawned upon us ; and it remains to apply a up , scientific cure to all error , to discover and state its causes with precision . For , without precision of statement , there can be no conviction ; but , with it , the conviction will come silently and irresistibly , since it will enlist the will to he sane , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , II the fulfillment of that promise is also hindered , as I have said , by certain unconscious assumptions of the psychologists , which make the promise itself seem a threat to the freedom of the mind . A great psychologist once said to me that he wished to free psychology altogether from philosophy . I answered that I did not know whether he could do it , or was right in aging to do it , but that he would certainly be right if he tried to free psychology from unconscious metaphysical assumptions . I was thinking of certain assumptions which seem to be often made by the Freudians , and which blind them to the proinise of their great discovery . For they , finding the causes of evil in the mind , and by that means often removing the evil , make no distinction , in this matter , between right and wrong processes of the mind , but assume that the right processes are caused in the same way as the wrong . That is their theory , but not , of course , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind by discovering its cause , but they do not try to remove a true belief by discovering its cause ; and , if they did , they would find it impossible , not merely because the discovery of the cause would fail to remove the belief , but also because the cause of true beliefs , and , indeed , of all right processes in the mind , can not be discovered . The Freudian might admit this in the case of true beliefs ; but he will not admit it in the case of other right processes . For instance , having discovered that many mental disorders are caused by the sexual instinct working in the unconscious , he is apt to assume that all the normal processes of the mind are controlled by the sexual instinct . He will tell you that all art is a disguised expression of the sexual instinct , because many failures and perversities of art can so be explained . And there are psychologists who will tell you that all morals are a product of the gregarious instinct , because we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both cases is that , behind the self and more real than the self , are a number of impersonal , and indeed mechanical , forces called instincts , into which the self can be analyzed away . As another psychologist once said to me : ' Freud bombs the self into fragments and then hands the fragments back to you with a complacent smile . ' We have a right to be suspicious of all theories that are incompatible with practice ; and no theory is more incompatible with the universal practice of mankind , ? and indeed of the Freudians , ? than this . Fox in practice , as I have said , they seek among these instincts only for the causes of what is wrong with the mind ; and they know when they have found these causes , because , by finding them , they are able to set the mind right . This test they can not apply , even if they would , the other way . No one has ever yet destroyed a true belief by discovering its causes ; for6true beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has yet discredited a right morality by connecting it with the gregarious instinct ; nor has anyone made good art seem bad , or deterred the artist from producing it , by asserting that it is an expression of the sexual instinct . We may find in the N2 EVIL AND THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY egotism of mankind a cause for the once universal belief that the earth was the centre of the universe ; we can find no cause for the belief that the sun is the centre of our solar system , except the fact that it is true . We may see the working of the gregarious instinct in much conventional morality ; we may even suddenly he-come aware of that instinct in our own morality ; but to see it , is to discredit the morality . We are not aware of it in the morals of Socrates or of Christ , which are to us morals and arouse our sense of moral value because they revolt against the tyranny of the gregarious instinct . They are not caused as gregarious morality is caused ; at least there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , when detected , discredits them . As we accept a true belief because it is true , so we accept their morals because they are good . Again , it is the bad or the half-insane artist who finds a vent in his art for his unsatisfied appetites ; and a psychologist can explain the causes of his failure so that we are convinced by the explanation . But , if he tries to explain success in art in the same way , we are not convinced , nor is the artist . I may see unconscious , . unsatisfied , sexual instinct in some religious picture that revolts me with its sensuality disguised as sentimentality ; or the discovery of that instinct may put me out of conceit with a picture that I myself have liked because it made a disguised appeal to my own sexual instinct . But I can not see sex at all in Rembrandt 's Supper at Emmaus , or in Mozart 's G minor Quintet ; nor would it put the out of conceit with these , to be told that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , even if I believed it : it would leave no practical effect on my feelings such as is produced by the discovery and precise statement of the causes of bad art . And the reason here , as in the other cases , is that good art has not causes , like bad art . I accept it because it is beautiful , as I accept a true belief because it is true , or good morals because they are good . Certainly , there is good art in which sex is the theme ; but it is consciously chosen by the artist as his theme . It was not the sexual instinct that caused Correggio to paint his Antiope ; nor is it the sexual instinct that causes us to admire it . The picture can not be discredited by imputing a sexual cause to it ; for whatever there is of sex in it is conscious , both in the artist and in the spectator , being theme and not cause . In fact , the whole theory of the un . conscious , advanced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results , implies just that difference between the right and wrong processes of the mind which the Freudians tend to deny . The sexual instinct , they say , is dangerous to us when it is disguised ; and that must be true also of other in. stints , such as the gregarious . And the reason is that these instincts can control the processes of the mind only when it is unaware of their control . It is then that they act as hidden causes , even of thought , mastering and perverting the three spiritual activities ? the moral , the intellectual , and the aesthetic . But this tyranny can be ended , as phobias can be ended , by becoming aware of it ; and the Freudian method is to make us aware of it , and so to appeal to some other power in the mind which is stung into action as soon as it sees its enemies . Yet , according to the Freudian metaphysic , there is no other power . It is the instincts that become aware of themselves , not a self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think that , when instincts become aware of themselves , they control themselves . This is absurd , and inconsistent with // the Freudian theory of the Censor , a mysterious power in the mind which prevents it from being aware of the working of its instincts . Clearly , instincts , by themselves , are not capable of consciousness ; something else must be conscious , or unconscious , of them . You may , as some psychologists do , deny consciousness altogether ; but you can not itnpute it to instinct nor can you hold that it is caused by instincts working in concert or conflict with each other . Consciousness is consciousness of their concert or conflict ; it is something which can control their concert or conflict ; and we have never heard yet of an effect that can control its cause . The practical appeal of the Freudians is always to consciousness ; they imply that it has the power to control instinct and so that it is something over and above instinct . Even while they tell us that we are all sex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us control of sex in the interests of the self ; they do not mean that we should immediately proceed to net as sexual machines . There is a class III of theories about the nature of mind which may be called suicidal ? they are like the pig , which is said to cut its own throat by swimming ; for they attack the validity of all mental processes , including those which produce them . Thus , if everything in the mind is caused by instinct ; if all morals come of the gregarious instinct and all art of the sexual ; if our value for what we call righteousness and beauty h really only these two instincts giving themselves fine names to satisfy some further and self-deceiving instinct , the nature and purpose of which no one an explain , then intellectual processes also are subject to the same explanation , and that which we call our value for truth is but an instinct giving itself a fine name . Truth is a figment of the self-deceiving instinct , like righteousness and beauty ; and there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or msthetic . But , if that is so , then , since it is the intellectual process which produces the theory , the theory itself is discredited with all that it discredits . A Freudian could not continue to be a theorist at all if he held that conviction of truth is caused , as he holds moral conviction to be , by some instinct which transforms itself in consciousness into that conviction . He must reserve the intellectual activity from his destructive analysis , or the analysis also is destroyed by itself . In practice , of course , he does reserve it , does hold that there is such a thing as truth to be discovered by the human mind , since he tries to discover it . While he may contend that all morals are to be explained in terms of the gregarious instinct , or all art in terms of the sexual , he does not explain his own theories in terms of any instinct . They are to him the truth ; and truth means to all of us a belief that is in accordance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the moment we become aware of an unconscious cause for any belief of our own or of others , it is discredited for us , just as morals are discredited when we see them to be a product of the gregarious instinct . As I began by saying ? the way to destroy a belief is to discover its cause . But if the integrity of the intellectual activity must be maintained , why not the integrity of the moral and aesthetic activities ? If there is such a thing as truth , which can be directly perceived by the mind , why are not righteousness and beauty also to be directly perceived ? Why not attempt , with regard to these also , a reconciliation between theory and practice ? Such a reconciliation is now most urgently needed ; 304 EVIL AND THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY for we are all troubled , consciously or unconsciously , by a misgiving that our judgments of value lack the validity of our judgments of fact ; that they are the effects of mechanical causes ; and that , if we could understand how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us , and we should lose the convictions that give life all its meaning . So long as we have this misgiving , the passion for truth seems the enemy of the passion for righteousness and beauty ; and if that is so , then are we of all creatures the most miserable . But there is , I believe , the promise of a reconciliation in that very discovery , which to the Freudians seems to establish the automatic nature of mind ; for what it does establish is the fact that all three spiritual activities of the mind are alike subject to disorders mechanically caused ; in fact , that evil is so caused in all its forms . It does not establish the fact that good is so caused ; indeed , instead of reducing good and evil both to the same mechanical process , it points to a new distinction between them , and one that gives us a new hope of mastering evil . The words cause and effect are dangerous to thought , because we think that we understand their meaning when we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil is caused and good is not ; but rather that evil , in the mind , is something of which a definite and immediate cause can be discovered , and which can often be removed by the discovery of that cause ; whereas good is something of which no definite or immediate cause can be discovered . This difference is hard to understand , and the difficulty has expressed itself in the dilemma of free will and predestination . Men have always seen , more or less dimly , the causes of the wrong processes of the mind , and so have inclined , when they thought of these , to determinism ; but they have also failed to see any causes of the right processes of the mind ; and , when they have thought of these , have inclined to a belief in the freedom of the will . In fact , the mind is like a machine when it acts wrongly , but not when it acts rightly . But in the past there have been very strong practical causes for the assump. tion that the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeding on that assumption , men have found a cure or a palliative for many of the evils to which the mind is subject . So long as all kinds of wrong conduct , or even wrong belief , were held to be the expression of an evil will subject to no causes outside itself , there was no way of dealing with them except by punish . ment , which was usually itself a me. chanical reaction and blind in its effects . But , as soon as wrong conduct and wrong belief were seen to hose causes that can be discovered , their causes were sought , and sometimes found , with the best results . The flea psychology is based on the assumption , constantly confirmed by experience , that there are causes for all error and evil in the mind ; and its great discovery is that the mind , when aware of these causes , will , with the whole of itself , resist and often overcome them . But that is no reason why it should slip into the further assumption that what is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is evil ; or should , in older terms , utterly deny the freedom of the will . Rather , we . should look to the new psychology to illustrate both freedom and the lack of it ; for , ' hard as it is to understand , or even to state the fact , both freedom and lack of it seem to exist . It is only in theory that we ever think of discovering the causes of good . The practice of mankind is to take good for granted , as something that of its nature needs no explanation . But the same practice // seeks an explanation of evil ; for evil is that which ought not to be , that which instantly arouses in us the desire to remove it . There is , in fact , a problem of evil but , in the nature of things , no problem of good . The word provoked by evil is , why ? but that word is never provoked by good . Good is identical with the self unified in a right relation , or answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self losing its unity , its identity , under a tyranny of external circumstances which turns it into a machine . Always when we are aware of evil in ourselves or in others , we are aware of the mechanical or automatic ; the pain of evil consists in this , that it makes the self seem to itself a machine out of order . But it never seems to itself a machine in order , when it acts rightly . The sense of the mechanical , the caused , in the human mind is itself a sense of evil ; and to it im- port t also into good is to deny the difference between them . According to the Freudians themselves , consciousness is good and unconsciousness evil , which means that automatism in the mind is evil , and something else ? which we may call , vaguely enough , life or freedom ? is good . But when we say that consciousness is good and unconsciousness evil , , tve need to know more precisely what we mean by those words . There is a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a necessary part of every mind ; though in this sense also the cord is still vaguely used . But when the Freudian speaks of the unconscious as the enemy , he means the unconscious as a deceiver ; means certain instincts disguising themselves in the conscious , so that it takes them for something other than they are . In that case , of course , consciousness is imperfect . If it were perfect , it would see through the disguise ; and the effort of the psychoanalyst is to make it more perfect , VOL 131 ? 10. so that it can see through the disguise . Evil of all kinds ? error , fear , hatred , all that makes for madness ? thrives like a bacillus in the darkness of the mind ; when the light of consciousness is turned upon it , it ceases to thrive . IV Here , it might seem , we are back at the old barren and unconvincing simplification of evil into ignorance , and good into knowledge . But the discovery of the new psychology is of value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while doing justice to knowledge . The word conscious is misleading , because it seems to mean a purely intellectual process ; but , in fact , when a man becomes aware of the cause of error , or of any other evil in his mind , the process by which he overcomes that evil is more than intellectual . The awareness of evil , in proportion to its completeness and precision , causes the whole mind to mobilize against the evil , to unify itself against that danger which threatens its unity . Where the unity of the mind is impaired by any evil within it , whether sin or error , it is filled with a sense of impotence , and of automatism ; it begins at once to believe about itself that which will become true if the evil persists and increases . And the more completely it is unconscious of the evil and of its cause , the more automatic and impotent it seems to itself . But consciousness of the evil and of its cause at once gives the mind confidence in its own unity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of repentance , because repentance means an access , however imperfect , of consciousness , and so of the sense of power . And what is repentance or conviction of sin but the beginning , at least , of that consciousness which , according to the new BOO EVIL AND THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY psychology , is the healer of the mind ? Men do get strength from confession because it forces them to state their sin in plain terms ; it is the beginning of the process which the psychoanalyst tries to complete . And when Plato said that the lie of the soul was the worst of all lies , he meant the lie with which the unconscious deceives the conscious , the lie which makes men behave automatically while they think they are behaving like rational creatures . Perhaps the greatest and most dangerous of all human errors is the belief that we are , always and in all respects , alive ; that we have been born alive and must remain so until we die . For , in fact , the living part of us , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a mechanical process , like those processes to which inorganic matter is subject . Just as our minds still have in them a brutishness inherited from the past , so our very life seems to inherit habits from the inorganic matter out of whirls it has arisen ; and because of this inheritance , it is always , more or less , imperfectly life . The body , for instance , is subject to strange automatisms of disease , in which a purposeless growth destroys its life ; and madness is an automatism of the mind , in which instincts behave as if they really were forces , and the unconscious masters the conscious . This invasion and conquest of life by not-life is what we mean by evil , whether it takes the form of disease , of error , of sin , or of aesthetic perversity . In fact , the difference between evil and good is not less , but far greater than we ever dreamed it was ; for it is the difference , in a living creature , between life and not-life . And our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a matter of consciousness only , is life 's hatred and fear of a threatening and invasive not-life . We feel that hatred and fear with the whole living part of ourselves ; but the more evil masters us , the more are that hatred and fear weakened with the life which is being overcome by not-life . Hence the close conneo. tion between error and sin and esthetic perversity ; they are all symptoms of not-life , of automatism mastering life It is because we suppose that we are always and in all respects alive , that we have failed to see the identity between life and good , and between evil and not-life . We can not think of life as identical with good so long as we believe that we are always fully alive ; for we know that we are not always completely good . And while we know that good is a matter of quality , we sup . pose life to be a matter of quantity , to be merely something that is or is not . But , in fact , the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ; and the struggle for life is not merely a struggle of life to maintain itself against external dangers : it is also , and still more , an internal struggle . Life is always fighting for its life against a tend . ency within itself to behave as if it were not-life ; and it is this struggle , carried on in purely physical terms in the lower forms of life , that becomes , in the higher , moral , intellectual , esthetic , without ceasing to be still a struggle of life against not-life . That which we call the spirit of Mall , that which distinguishes him from the beasts , is a higher quality , a greater intensity , of life ; but this greater intensity never escapes from the struggle with automatisms . The musician composing a melody must resist them ; only , the more completely he is an artist , the more fully is he aware of their danger . And that is true also of the saint , and the philosopher . Bad art , bad thinking , wrong conduct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life we are in death more profoundly than we ever have supposed . The Manichmans , when they said EVIL AND THE that matter was evil , had a glimmering of the truth , for they saw that evil was not something inherent in spirit of life . But they were wrong in making the final distinction between matter and spirit . The final distinction is between life and not-life . In fact , the issue between good and evil , so far from being confused by the discoveries of the new psychology , is made sharper and more momentous than it ever was before . All forms of evil are allied , as being automatisms ; and all forms of good , as being manifestations and efforts of life . Psychology itself , when it is real psychology , is not merely a curiosity which may discover ugly truths about the mind , and which may , therefore , be the enemy of our moral and aesthetic values . It is also part of the effort of life to be more intensely life , to extend that consciousness which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the struggle for life as being purely instinctive or automatic , there will seem to us to be a ; edict , which never can be reconciled , between that struggle and the higher activities of man ; but this sense of a conflict that can not be reconciled is only a modern form of Manichmism . As soon as the struggle for life becomes to us a struggle against automatism , a struggle for quality rather than quantity of life , we escape from the Manielnean sense of an irreconcilable conflict . The instinct of self-preservation , when it acts against the higher activities of the spirit , becomes for us , not the struggle for life , but a mere automatism , which life itself must resist . And so it is with all the other instincts : they are not evil , as the Manichmnns held , nor are they irresistible forces behind the consciousness which , to flatter itself , it calls by pretty names . But they are liable to become automatic , when the consciousness fails to antral them ; and it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the awareness at which the psychoanalyst aims is part of the effort of life to preserve itself from automatism , to make the whole mind alive and so good . Some may fear that this identification of good with life , and of evil with not-life , will destroy for us the reality of the distinction between good and evil . Any theory which does that is malign , and sure , sooner or later , to be condemned by the judgment of mankind . For , in fact , no distinction is so real to us as that between good and evil ; and , if we lost it , we should lose all sense of our own identity . Yes , but our sense of our own identity , so bound up with our sense of the difference between good and evil , is our sense of life . For life does not mean in fact , as it often means in talk , some vague common stock , which we all share . It means the individual self , and it exists only in individual selves . Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity of life , the more differentiation there is ; and that is true also of all kinds of good . There is a common stock of bad poetry , but the good poem says one thing as only it can be said . Our sense of its goodness is a sense of differentiation from all other poems ; and , when we have said that it is good , we are apt to add also that it is alive . Automatism to us , in poetry and all art , means commonplace , deadness , badness . And so it is with conduct . We are aware of a sameness in all kinds of wickedness . Milton 's Satan is not evil as it is , but evil glorified by the expression of a great poet . In evil , as we really meet it , there is something dull and generic , rather than specific and brilliant ; it is mechanical , automatic action , without regard to the particular facts . A man subject to lust or rage or egotism becomes a machine , and behaves like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in him the passions , not himself ; and what horrifies us in wickedness , besides its effects , is this dying of life out of the human being , this horrible marionettism pretending to be life . Whenever we hate a man , he has ceased to be himself to us , and become generic , typical of some automatism , while we ourselves , in that hatred , are also invaded by automatism . And it is the same with thought : error has always something generic in it , while truth is specific ; for error is automatism pretending to be thought and repeating itself in formulas ; while truth is that particular truth and no other . Until we identify life with good , life is not completely life to us ; nor is good completely good . The identification throws light on both of them , like the identification of God with love . So long as we think of life as not being necessarily and altogether good , we suppose that those automatisms which attack it belong to it ; and so long as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not altogether in love with it , but suppose that it may be dull and monotonous . So there are people who imagine that saints are unpleasant , or that classical music has no melody , or that all truths are unwelcome . To them good is something not quite alive ; and they may even be drawn to evil because they suppose it to be more alive than good . So their sense of the difference between good and evil is actually weakened by their failure to identify good with life and evil with not-life . And , finally , there is this failure in the perversities of the new psychology . If the Freudian saw that good was life and evil not-life , he would see that the analysis which he can apply to evil in the mind can not also be applied to good . For that analysis is itself part of the effort which life makes to rid itself of not-life . Good , that is life , the unified self , can not analyze itself ; it can only analyze the automatisms which threaten its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatisms , it is becoming automatic ; and nothing could be more automatic than some of the assumptions of the Freudians . So long as they deal with evil , they are men of science , and there is the life of thought in them ; but , as soon as they try to subject the whole content of the mind to their analysis , the life dies out of their thinking , and they repeat formulm , unconfirmed by experience . At one moment Freud is a man of genius , is himself , and no one else , in an eager , living pursuit of truth ; at the next , he is mastered by an unconscious assumption and becomes a Freudian . The practical task of psychology is always , in a sense , negative ; it is to remove from the mind obstacles to its own vital process . In that it is like all medicine , the task of which is , not to make health , but to remove obstacles to it . Just as medicine can discover the causes of disease , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and its environment , but not of right , so psychology can analyze , and remove by its analysis , all that makes for automatism in the mind , but not the life of the mind . And that is the practice of the Freudian , whatever his theory may be . He puts his faith in the life of the mind , when he has exposed its automatisms by analysis ; and it is the underlying principle of all psychoanalysis that the final appeal must be to the life of the mind by making it aware of its automatisms . That life , that unity , that consciousness , or conscience , is there , to be strengthened by external help , but not to be explained by the same process that explains and destroys the unconscious automatism , evil . For , even if it could be so explained , there would finally be nothing for the psychoanalyst to appeal to , no difference between good and evil , between life and not-life.                @ @ @ @ @
