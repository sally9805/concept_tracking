txt A wise financial man lays : " The Bok peace prize is a foolishness from the beginning . Peace does hot come by any plan . National and international peace is a matter of the human heart .. I have no doubt Mr. Rockefeller would give millions for a practical or business plan to promote the Christian religion over the whole world . But no plan for world reformation is possible by essays , or words , or prizes , or societies , or combinations of societies , or propaganda , or popular votes . ' Wilson 's plan for international peace was a League of Nations and it has bedeviled the whole world . Mr. Bok should have offered a prize to the man who can tell how to make the League of Nations function and it would have cost him nothing . " The world is covered with peace plans from Ford 's Peace Ship to the League of Nations . But it is not plans that are wanted . What is wanted is execution . Mr. Ford had an idea for peace , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas for peace and regulation of labor and tariffs through the world by a commission sitting in Switzerland . The whole world is filled with words for peace . But neither plans , nor - words reform . The reform must begin in the human heart . Christ came into the world to bring peace and people are still struggling to promote His plan , and is there any other plan than His  --  the substitution of Love for Hate ? The Christian Religion  --  the Sermon on the Mount  --  is the promotn of Peace and not the League of Nations or any league of notions . "
