More deaf people , and dumb , tried airplane rides last week to cure their deficiencies . But they got no more good than did Julius Shaefer , 10 , terrified the previous week ( TIME , Aug. 27 ) . Fright or sudden air drops may temporarily help cure some cases of deafness or vocal paralysis , but not when essential nerves are dead or brain centres undeveloped . <P> This Dr. Edwin H. Coward , superintendent of the Atlantic County Hospital , knew last week when he fondly took Bob White , seven months old , to the Atlantic City airport . He put Bob White in a plane . It rose , swooped up and down . Bob White cowered . The plane came to earth . Bob White clambered out of the cockpit . Men chirruped at him ; they whistled ; they called . And for the first time in his life Bob White heard sounds . Delighted he yelped answers . No congenital deafness was his . More delighted was Dr. Coward . He cherishes Bob White , finely bred grandson of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Thomas Edison who is very hard of hearing , once declared that in 100 years all people would be deaf . Of course he was exaggerating . Yet it is certain that hearing defects have been increasing . In England one-third of the population , it is estimated , can not hear perfectly . Doctors are investigating . One important cause that they blame is city noises . The cacophony injures the auditory nerves , the brain , the whole nervous system .
