People resent the sight of a corpse because it reminds them of their own mortality . Cherishing the memory of the dead one , they treat his clay with reverence although secretly detesting the stiff and putrefying souvenir left behind . If a corpse must lie in the same room with the quick , its face is covered with a cloth or dissembled with cosmetics . Newspapers have recognized this unwillingness to look up on cadavers , and it has been a journalistic tradition never to print pictures of those killed by violence except for purposes of identification , and then only after the photograph has been retouched . Instead of showing the actual body when reproducing the scene of a murder , a stock phrase was used , " X marks the spot . . . . " How this phrase is vanishing from journalism was deplorably demonstrated last week by two Manhattan gum-chewers ' sheets . <P> The Daily News was first . In its pages appeared the photograph of a man who had just been struck by a truck . He was shown lying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the caption SPEEDY WORK BY CAMERA MAN . As a matter of fact , the " speedy work " was not so notable as it might have seemed , for the accident had occurred within a stone 's throw of the editorial rooms of the News ; a camera man had merely to dash down stairs and run a block to take the offensive photograph . In this example of horrifying journalism there was the smell of an excuse , for the victim had not been killed-merely knocked down , internally injured , and fractured in the skull . There was life in the corpselike shape-all that was earthly of one John Flake . <P> No such circumstance could be brought forward to extenuate the revolting offense perpetrated two days later by the Hearst Evening Journal . A life-beaten , despairing , undernourished Jew , one David Belinsky , deserted by his wife , had taken the lives of his tiny twin boys and committed suicide . The Journal reporter hurried to the Broad Street Hospital , where the two babies-five months old-were lying side by side after they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lay there- the dry mouths contorted in the gape of their last , desperate expiration , their heads twisted sidewise on the pillow . ISADORE AND MORRIS BELINSKY DEAD IN BED headlined the Evening Journal <P> The News , the Journal , are quite capable of gauging the taste of their readers , which is also the taste of those individuals who , appearing automatically like sharks or vultures when a killing has occurred , jostle one another for a glimpse of the body while the blue-coated officer pushes them back . Such people pored with great enjoyment over the photograph of the maimed Flake , of the dead Belinskys , enchanted that from their favorite newspapers that annoying phrase , " X marks the spot , " has disappeared .
