In Algiers on a steep mount overhanging the city was placed , centuries ago , an image of Isis done in the blackest of black basalt . Early in the Christian Era , the image was accepted by the African Christians as an image of the Blessed Virgin . <P> The story of this myth was retold last Sunday at Dr. William Guthrie 's church , Manhattan , by a dramatic reading from the Gospel of Isis and Osiris . Said Rector Guthrie : " God wanted the Gospel of Jesus preached in Africa . The discovered ' Black Madonna ' meant that He does not reject the negro race from His family and would be willing to have His Mother belong to that race . Here then is living contact to be made with the religious myths and dogmas of the Nile Valley in ancient days in the midst of a swarming Mahammadan and Christian city of our time .
