Mrs. Maxim Maximovich Litvinov , wife of the Soviet commissar for foreign affairs , is English , forthright , tart-tongued . She has never met President Herbert Hoover nor Secretary of State Henry Lewis Stimson . But at Geneva last spring she beheld the dapper gentleman they sent to tell the League of Nations and the world for the first time about the President 's disarmament plans-Hugh Simons Gibson , U. S. Ambassador to Belgium . <P> " I shoul d call Gibson a contemptible little bounder , " drawled English Mrs. Litvinov not long afterward , and she had a great many things in mind . They bear importantly on the strained relations between Washington and Moscow , relations which creaked last week when Statesman Stimson politely reminded Russia and China in identic notes of their obligation under the Kellogg Pact not to fight , only to be told by Comrade Litvinov with blazing scorn to mind his business . <P> Ambassador Gibson arrived in Geneva last spring , heard Comrade Litvinov expound to the great powers his cherished scheme of disarmament on which he had labored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan-which Mr. Gibson had in his pocket-paralleled almost exactly in its two most important aspects the Litvinov scheme , * though no one present knew that then except Mr. Gibson . Plan in pocket , he let Litvinov talk , declined to comment in open meeting , told correspondents privately that the Soviet scheme was not worthy of comment or consideration , suggested that Comrade Litvinov had presented it in bad faith . <P> Later , when Ambassador Gibson offered to the world in the name of President Hoover and Secretary Stimson what seemed to Mrs. Litvinov basically her husband 's plan , she made up her mind that " contemptible " was the right adjective , " bounder " the right noun . <P> " Good faith indeed ! " she has said with honest English ire . " My husband is deeply , passionately sincere . He believes in his disarmament plan , and he offered it with all his heart . " <P> Battle Plane Prejudice . To the desk of Comrade Litvinov in the Kremlin came intelligence , last week , that a ship had just cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second consignment of a $1,000,000 order for battle planes of the Vought Corsair type used by the U. S. Navy , built at Long Island City . Soon these planes might be bombing Soviet villages near the Sino-Russian frontier . Naturally the U. S. State Department was not responsible for the shipment , but it may have prejudiced Comrade Litvinov as he ruffled his copy of Statesman Stimson 's note , pondered its powerful conclusion : <P> " The American Government feels that the respect with which China and Russia will hereafter be held in the good opinion of the world will necessarily in great measure depend upon the way in which they carry out their most sacred promises as signatories of the Kellogg Pact .
