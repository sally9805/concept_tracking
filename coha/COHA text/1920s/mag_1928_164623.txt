The symbol of France is a spunky , militant , land-lubbing Cock ; but for one day last week Frenchmen raised the three-spiked Trident of sea power . For once the name of " Admiral of the Fleet " *Henri Salaun loomed on a momentary par with that of Marshal Ferdinand Foch . The occasion was twofold : first a review of the Grand Fleet , off Havre , and second the inauguration , at Havre , of the new docks and deep water basin-a prodigious puddle capable of accommodating simultaneously the two largest ships in the world , the Majestic and Leviathan . <P> <P> President of France Gaston Doumergue stood like a florid Neptune on the bridge of the destroyer Jaguar , so-called fastest war boat in the world . Steamed past the Jaguar in a double line six miles long 80 war boats , of which 42 have been completed since the close of the War To End War . <P> Overhead droned and Doomed in salute 100 naval aircraft . Slipped and slithered beneath the waves a goodly representation of the 98 submarines built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friends , since the navies of her enemies have been virtually destroyed . Most potent of the new French surface ships are the cruisers Duquesne and Tourville , each of 10,000 tons , and capable of hurtling toward an enemy at 40 miles an hour . <P> French editors professed to be shocked , last week , that the U. S. had lavished on naval appropriations , since the armistice , five times as much as France . Citizens of the U. S. are vexed when they reflect that France has lavished enough to pay off one-fifth of her debt to the U.S. <P> Jovial Neptune Doumergue promised , last week , in a mellifluent oration that France will never loose her sea dogs in a war of conquest , will employ them solely as sea watch dogs . <P> <P> The new deep sea basin was formally inaugurated by President Doumergue on the quay , and ebulliently toasted at a champagne banquet aboard the French liner Paris . There Neptune , confronted by a noble fare , beamingly exchanged his metaphysical Trident for a fork , and proved once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to France . <P> <P> *Approximate English rendering of his peculiar French status as the Vice-Admiral actually in command of French warboats.
