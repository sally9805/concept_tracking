txt In nine corps areas , north , south . east and west , 28,000 young ? men are in the Citizens ' Military Training Camps of the country this year . All are volunteers , and the drill and training they undergo , with recreational intervals . constitute their vacation . In the Spring there were nearly 50,000 applications for military instruction , but not enough money was available to send more than 28,000 to the camps . This number was , however , an increase of 17,000 over 1921 . When President HARDING said , after reviewing at the White House on Monday the Camp Meade citizen soldiers , that if he could have his wish there would be more than 100,000 young men " annually studying and preparing for armed service " at the training camps , he spoke , for General PERSHING and the General Staff as well as for the President , who is Commander in Chief of the army . The Importance of training as many young men as will present themselves in the school of the soldier for the national defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced by Congress until its strength is not much greater than that of the land forces before the World War , and the inclination of our lawmaiteris is to reduce it still further . The ' National Guard is below its authorized complement , and in some of . the States enlistm ents are slow . ' Unless the Citizens ' Training Camps furnish a steadily growing reserve of good material for the national defense , a call to arms would find the country not much better prepared than it was in the emergency of 1917 . In the course of a few years ; if interest in the camps continues and if Congress is wise enough to understand that . the training prescribed costs much less proportionately than maintaining regulae troops , a reserve of a million volunteer soldiers will ? hive been created . The training camp has already become the vacation ' ground for increasing numbers of young men . Lieut . Col. ARTHUR F. COSBY , National Executive Secretary of the Citizens ' Camp Association , took a referendum of parents after the New York camp closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In almost every instance the response was that their sons had returned home in excellent health , with a greater sense of discipline and responsibility , and morally better for the instruction given by officers in the open air ' assemblies . Speaking of the life at the : , amps , Colonel*Cossr says : It is n't all drilling as in war times . There 1S ample recreation . nces are Mouses , regularly given at hostess and all possible care is taken to see that everybody is happy . The day is d17 vided into military training in the mornings ; physical culture and athletics , including group games , field and track sports , tor ' the afternoon , . and recreation in the evening . I would like to tell fathers and mothers that every parent should encourage a healthy , enthusiastic boyto go to a vacation camp .

They liked the work , they liked the play , and they treasured the associations they had formed . The success of the camps ' of 1921 was . proved by the application list of 1922 : It is not an illusory hope that in'the nine corps areas training will soon be given to ** volunteers annually . There ' ' would then be no uneasiness about the defense of the country or " the preservation of the Government by law under which we live . "
