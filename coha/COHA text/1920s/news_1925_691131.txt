txt The authorities of New York University are considering a proposal , it was learned yesterday , to transplant the Stanford White tower and the SaintGaudens statue of Diana from Madison Square Garden to a new building to be erected on University Heights . An outside friend of the university made the suggestion , which has been sympathetically received by the university authorities . They regard University Heights as an appropriate location for the tower and statue , not only because its artistic effect would be preserved by the isolation it would have in the spacious university grounds but also because Stanford White , the architect of the tower , was also the architect of many of the university buildings . The proposal provides for the storage of the tower and the statue between May 1 next , when the work of tearing down Madison Square Garden will begin , and the time when the new location is ready . When ' tie building , which has already been planned for , is erected , the souvenir of the old Garden will be worked into it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been estimated that the cost ? of removing the tower and the statue , transporting them to New York University , and storing- them until work starts on the new building , would be about $15,000 or $20,000 . The university authorities do not expect to make any drive to raise this money , but they are considering the possibility that some graduate or friend of the university may come forward to guarantee the cost . The university authorities believe that the tower and the statue would help to beautify the university heights .. kand that the university grounds would be the most fitting location for them . Whatever may be done about the matter , it is proposed to save all the terra cotta and other material possible from the tower , as well as the statue of Diana itself , so that the whole thing can be put up again in as nearly its original Position as possible .

It was decided some time ago that the historic tower and statue of Diana would be out of place in those surroundings and that they would have to go with the rest of the ? building . Diana and Tower Offered to City . The life insurance company offered the tower and the statue to the city , with the suggestion that they be erected in Madison Square Park . This suggesion was rejected by the Municipal Art Commission , of which Hobert W. de Forest is Chairman , who suggested a more appropriate site . In a discussion of possible locations for the tower and statue , Mr. de Forest said : " While the tower owes much of its effect to the large buildings covering an entire city block to which it is architecturally related . its preservatibn , even separated from that building , is highly desirable , particularly if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty , " There are undoubtedly several situations in and around the city where this tower could be placed and have sufficient isolation , present and prospective , to retain its remarkable beauty . But we are in doubt whether it can have an appropriate place in Madison Square . The surrounding buildings , many of which are tall and none of which are similar in style to the tower , would undoubtedly mar its artistic effect ; and it would be somewhat overwhelmed by the tower of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company , which differs from ft in style and dominates the southeast corner of the square . " Diana has stood aloft on the tower of Madison Square Garden for more than thirty years . The Garden , with its 840-foot tower , was builtin 1890 . The tower was somewhat like the famous Giralda Tower of Seville . Saint-Gaudenes first Diana atop the tower was 18 feet in height and.was taken down and sent to Chicago because it was too large in proportion to the rest of the building .
