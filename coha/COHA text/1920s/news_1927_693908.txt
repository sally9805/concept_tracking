txt At dawn tomorrow I take leave of England and fly back to France , where twelve memorable days ago I landed from my Atlantic flight . On Saturday I expect to start back to America on the cruiser Memphis , to be received by President Coolidge at Washington . The four days I spent in England I can never forget . From the time I landed in that tumultuous crowd at Croydon at the end of my flight from Brussels till now I have had an entrancing time . Tonight I am the guest of officers of the Royal Air Force at Kenley Airdrome , although I had expected to take off at 3 this afternoon for Paris . Foggy conditions between here and Paris have held me up , and now I expect to start at dawn tomorrow in a British fighting plane placed at ny disposal by the Royal Air Force . In addition to my wonderful reception at Croydon on my arrival , my visit to Buckingham Palace and the Derby yesterday stand out in my recollection of these hectic days . Got New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion . It has not even rained , and I did n't get a chance to see a London fog . That will be kept for my next trip . My experience in London has brought to me a new conception of the English people . I had never met them before , but had always heard how cold they were . There must have been some mistake . They have n't been cold to me . Naturally , I did not expect the British to be so demonstrative as that most demonstrative people , the French . I had expected friendliness and , frankly , some reserve . But there has been a great deal of enthusiasm shown on every possible occasion . Whatever aloofness there may be in English character was certainly reserved for some one else . I have had nothing but expressions of good-will for my country and for myself . The sporting instinct of the British must be largely responsible for the respect they have shown for the feat which I had the good fortune to accomplish . And , after all , two Britishers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will surely be one of my stopping-off places on my next trip to Europe , which is not going to be too far away . While my stay in London has not been so wildly hectic as the days passed in Paris , what has surprised me is the manner in which interest in my flight continues so long . It seems no longer regarded as a stunt , but as a real accomplishment , and I take a great deal of pleasure in that , for , my chief interest being in the development of aviation , naturally I am proud to have done something so widely regarded as having contributed to progress in that direction . So that now I dream of days when airships will land daily at Le Bourget and Croydon , coming from the United States . Thanks Americans in London . Before leaving London wish to thank the Americans here for the warm reception they gave me and the kindly way they treated me . Also the English press has been most kind . 1 . was , in a way , expecting a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it has been very mild , and journalists have been most sympathetic , even when I failed in the crucial test of exhibiting proper interest in the Derby . As a matter of fact , I know very little about horse racing and did n't feel like taking a chance on making out that I did . I got a tip on the race sent me by an anonymous friend on a postcard , but I did not put any money on it ; and it 's just as well , for the horse was nowhere around at the finish of this classic . But I was tremendously interested in the crowd . I understand there were a quarter of a million people there . It looked something like Le Bourget . I am flying back to Paris tomorrow to keep a promise made in Paris that , having landed in France from America , I would leave France to go back to America . Tomorrow I plan to rest up and on Saturday fly to Cherbourg to sail on the Memphis . Despite the appreciation I feel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six days at sea . On the way over I intend to complete this series of articles on my trip and to look over possible material for a book if I. am capable of the task . THE NEW YORK TIMES man ? who will accompany me ' has kindly promised to aid , and perhaps I can think of some features of my trip which have not yet been completely told . I feel proper credit has not been given those who helped me make the flight successful , and I wish to repair that . Hopes for Good Aviation " Job . " As for all the many offers which have been made to me to make money , I shall decide nothing until I reach the United State . Whatever will aid aviation will interest me . Whatever does not mean help to aviation will not interest me at all . After my friends have completed all those receptions I have been hearing about I am planning to take a rest . I have an idea that after that I may find a good aviation job , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounds of progress before I die . Now that it is about all over for me in the way of receptions , I am being asked what impressed me most among them all . There can be but one answer , and that is , the reception at Le Bourget . Perhaps it was because it was so unexpected or perhaps because it spoiled me for others , but that one sticks in my mind . And necessarily so . For my part it meant the successful completion of my flight . For more than thirty hours through clouds and sleet my mind had been strained toward Le Bourget , and for days and days before starting my thoughts had been on arriving there . It meant the end of a chapter in my life and it meant the realization of a dream . It meant a great deal to me to land at Le Bourget . Le Bourget the Great Thrill . And on the part of the crowd , those people had been waiting there in the cold for hours as darkness spread about . They had waited past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid I was lost . They were thinking of me in the same terms they thought of their heroes , Nungesser and Coll . And then all at once there I was , dropped down out of the dark . For me and for that crowd there was no beating the dramatic interest of the moment . So , much as I value the receptions the Belgians and English gave me , it certainly is a fact that landing in Le Bourget was the one great thrill of my life . I am now looking forward to getting back home and making a report on my trip . I would like to have flown back to make good a round trip , but my friends advised against it . My good ship has got to go back as freight  --  surely an undeserved lot for it . It has been boxed up , and tonight it will be on its humble way back to the States . It is going to stay in that box the shortest time possible , and when I get to New York I hope to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis is going back to St. Louis by the air route . It never deserved to go anywhere by any other route , and I feel a sense of shame and dereliction that it lies tonight in a box like a coffin . I shall do my best to see that we share receptions in America . It 's as good a ship as exists anywhere , and almost anybody , as well as I , could have flown it from New York to Paris . I feel that the scars the Le Bourget crowd left upon it are honorable scars . This is the seventh of a series of articles written by Captain Lindbergh especially for The New York Times . In future articles of the series , the next of which will be printed probably in tomorrow 's issue , Captain Lindbergh will give more of his European impressions , his views on aviation there and here , and will discuss other matters .
