txt NEW RETIRING AGE STIRS UNCLE DAN'L TO SARCASM I seen a piece in your paper the other day about some bank clerk , SO years old and still goin ' strong , being awarded a silver lovin ' cup , , and the very next day appeared an , other piece as to how they contemplated retiring New York City laborers at the age of 53 . Now , Mr. Editor , I read both items to the assembled multitude at the crossroads grocery store last night , and when I finished the one on the retirement scheme , says Uncle Dan'l to me : " Son , the substitution of them delicatessen shops for corner grocery stores in New York do n't give no chance for them city fellers to holler , but if you again lived down there I 'll bet them big broadeastin ' stations would be temporarily thrown out a kilter by your noise , by heck .
