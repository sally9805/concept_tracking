Mozart is seated at a table in a mean room orchestrating The Magic Flute . Leaves of ruled paper are strewn about the floor . His wife enters in great excitement . CONSTANZE There 's someone come to see you , someone important . Pray God , it 's a commission from court . MOZART ( Unmoved ) Not while Salieri 's alive . CONSTANZE Put on your slippers , dear . It 's someone dressed all in gray , with a gray mask over his eyes , and he 's come in a great coach with its coat of arms all covered up with gray cloth . Pray God , it 's a commission from court for a Te Deum or something . ( She tidies up the room in six gestures . ) MOZART Not while Salieri 's alive . CONSTANZE But , now , do be nice , ' Gangl , please . We must have some money , my treasure . Just listen to him and say " yes " and " thank you , " and then you and I 'll talk it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat ) Come , put this on . Step into your slippers . MOZART ( Sighing ) I 'm not well . I 'm at home . I 'm at work . There 's not a single visitor in the whole world that could interest me . Bring him in. p. 3 CONSTANZE ( Adjusting his stock ) Now do n't be proud . Just accept . ( She hurries out and presently reenters preceding the visitor . The visitor is dressed from head to foot in gray silk . His bright eyes look out through the holes in a narrow gray silk mask . He holds to his nose a gray perfumed handkerchief . One would say : an elegant undertaker . ) THE GRAY STEWARD Kappelmeister Mozart , servus . Gracious lady , servus . MOZART Servus . THE GRAY STEWARD Revered and noble master , wherever music reigns , wherever genius is valued , the name of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is MOZART Sir , I have always been confused by compliments and beg you to spare me that mortification by proceeding at once to the cause of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEWARD Revered master , before I lay my business before you , may I receive your promise that  --  whether you accept my commission or not  --  you both will MOZART I promise you our secrecy , unless our silence would prove dishonorable to me or injurious to someone else . Pray continue . THE GRAY STEWARD Know then , gracious and revered genius , that I come from a prince who combines all the qualities of birth , station , generosity and wisdom . p. 4 MOZART Ha ! A European secret . THE GRAY STEWARD His Excellency moreover has just sustained a bitter misfortune . He has lately lost his wife and consort , a lady who was the admiration of her court and the sole light of her bereaved husband 's life . Therefore , His Excellency , my master , commissions you to compose a Requiem Mass in honor of this lady . He asks you to pour into it the height of your invention and that wealth of melody and harmony that have made you the glory of our era . And for this music he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowns  --  two hundred now , and the second two hundred crowns when you deliver the first four numbers . MOZART Well , Constanze , I must not be proud . THE GRAY STEWARD There is but one proviso . MOZART Yes , I heard it . The work must represent the height of my invention . THE GRAY STEWARD That was an easy assumption , master . The proviso is this : You shall let His Excellency have this music as an anonymous work , and you shall never by any sign , by so much as the nod of your head , acknowledge that the work is yours . MOZART And His Excellency is not aware that the pages I may compose at the height of my invention may be their own sufficient signature ? p. 5 THE GRAY STEWARD That may be . Naturally my master will see to it that no other composer will ever be able to claim the work as his . MOZART Quick , give me your paper and I will sign it . Leave your two hundred crowns with my wife at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will have the first four numbers . Servus . Servus . THE GRAY STEWARD ( Backing out ) Servus , master . Servus , madame . ( Constanze returns in a moment and looks anxiously toward her husband . ) CONSTANZE A visit from Heaven , Gangl . Now you can go into the country . Now you can drink all the Bohemian water in the world . MOZART ( Bitterly ) Good . And just at a time when I was contemplating a Requiem Mass . But for myself . However , I must not be proud . CONSTANZE ( Trying to divert him ) Who can these people be ? Try and think . MOZART Oh , there 's no mystery about that . It 's the Count Von Walsegg . He composes himself . But for the most part he buys string quartets from us ; he erases the signatures and has them played in his castle . The courtiers flatter him and pretend that they have guessed him to be the composer . He does not deny it . He tries to appear confused . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will reduce my pride . p. 6 CONSTANZE You know he will only be laughed at . The music will speak for itself . Heaven wanted to give us four hundred crowns  --  MOZART  --  And Heaven went about it humorously . CONSTANZE What was his wife like ? MOZART Her impudences smelt to Heaven . She dressed like a page and called herself Cherubin . Her red cheeks and her black teeth and her sixty years are in my mind now . CONSTANZE ( After a pause ) We 'll give back the money . You can write the music , without writing it for them . MOZART No , I like this game . I like it for its very falseness . What does it matter who signs such music or to whom it is addressed ? ( He flings himself upon the sofa and turns his face to the wall . ) For whom do we write music ?  --  for musicians ? Salieri ! for patrons ? Von Walsegg ! for the public ? The Countess Von Walsegg !  --  I shall write this Requiem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying . CONSTANZE My beloved , do n't talk so ! Go to sleep . ( She spreads a shawl over his body ) How can you say such things ? Imagine even thinking such a thing ! You will live many years and write countless beautiful pages . We will return the money and refuse the commission . Then the matter will be closed . Now go to sleep , my treasure . ( She goes out , quietly closing the door behind her . Mozart , at the mercy of his youth , his illness and his genius , is shaken by a violent fit of weeping . The sobs gradually subside and he falls asleep . In his dream the Gray Steward returns. ) p. 7 THE GRAY STEWARD Mozart ! Turn and look at me . You know who I am . MOZART ( Not turning ) You are the steward of the Count Von Walsegg . Go tell him to write his own music . I will not stain my pen to celebrate his lady , so let the foul bury the foul . THE GRAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is Death itself that commissions MOZART Death is not so fastidious . Death carries no perfumed handkerchief . THE GRAY STEWARD Lie then against the wall . Know first that all the combinations of circumstance can suffer two interpretations , the apparent and the real . MOZART Then speak , sycophant , I know the apparent one . What other reading can this humiliation bear ? THE GRAY STEWARD It is Death itself that commands you this Requiem . You are to give a voice to all those millions sleeping , who have no one but you to speak for them . There lie the captains and the thieves , the queens and the drudges , while the evening of their earthly remembrance shuts in , and from that great field rises an eternal miserere nobis . Only through the intercession of great love , and of great art , which is love , can that despairing cry be eased . Was that not sufficient cause for this commission to be anonymous ? p. 8 MOZART ( Drops trembling on one knee beside the couch ) Forgive me . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mover was chosen from among the weakest and vainest of humans . Death has her now , and all her folly has passed into the dignity and grandeur of her state . Where is your pride now ? Here are her slippers and her trinkets . Press them against your lips . Again ! Again ! Know henceforth that only he who has kissed the leper can enter the kingdom of art . MOZART I have sinned , yet grant me one thing . Grant that I may live to finish the Requiem . THE GRAY STEWARD No ! No ! ( And it remains unfinished. )
