Oscar Tschirky lost his job last week . <P> He was given notice that presently his services would no longer be required . He bowed as unctuously as if he were once again seating the Crown Prince of Siam at the dinner table , and said he was sorry . <P> Oscar is heavy , thickset , grave-eyed . <P> His bow , which has been the chief instrument of his profession , mingles in just the right quantities , elements of deference and cordiality . Many people the world around know of Oscar ; many pretend they know him ; a great many actually have come to know him during the 35 years he has been with the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . <P> Said he : " I feel sad about it , naturally . <P> I feel sorry for Fifth Avenue that this hotel is going out of business . " He drummed the table thoughtfully with his fingers , and nodded solemnly again . " I opened the hotel and I will be closing it . " <P> For Oscar was on the staff when New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The regrets that troubled the soul of Oscar , however , never , entered into the discussions of a group of men who gathered in a downtown bank in New York and spent the day deliberating . They were realtors , and they talked of leases and rents , and how many stories an office building must rise in order to yield income proportionate to the value of a property in terms of Fifth Avenue frontage . In the end , they nodded in agreement on a real estate dicker which will wipe out the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel , a famed Manhattan landmark , a tradition of princesses and kings , Peacock Alley , memories of the Bradley-Martin ball of 1897 . <P> The hotel was sold , at a price said to be around $20,000,000 , and will be razed next summer . <P> Actually the Waldorf-Astoria , as it now stands , is two buildings . The first was erected by William Waldorf Astor , famed in real-estate deals of the last century , on the site of his residence at 33rd Street &; Fifth Avenue . He planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wanted to leave a great hotel as memorial . The Hotel Waldorf was the result . <P> Oscar Tschirky , it is said , passed by while excavations were in progress . " What 's going to be built here ? " he asked ; and learning that it was to be a new hotel , he asked for a job , got one . <P> The late George C. Boldt , previously manager of a hotel in Philadelphia , was brought to New York to operate the Waldorf and became the genius of its expansion . He induced John Jacob Astor , whose home was adjacent , at 34th Street &; Fifth Avenue to build the twin half of the hotel ; and this was opened in 1897 . <P> Then , as the Nineteenth Century drew to its close , was the golden time of the Waldorf-Astoria . Prancing , sleek horses drew gleaming broughams and victorias to the doors , porters ushered bejewelled ladies and distinguished gentlemen into the labyrinthine lobby . Hansom cabs picked up titled fares at the portals . <P> More recently , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been built to compete with the aging dignity of the Waldorf-Astoria , the hotel was taken over by Waldorf-Astoria , Inc. , of which General T. Coleman du Pont was a director . It is this corporation which last week sold the property to the Bethlehem Engineering Corp . The new owners stated that they would erect , on the Waldorf-Astoria site , a 50-story office building .
