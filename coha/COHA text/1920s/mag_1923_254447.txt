Police Commissioner Enright of New York contends that his administration has been notably efficient . <P> " There is less crime in the city today than in many years , " said he in a speech at Manhattan 's Town Hall . <P> Commissioner Enright , it will be remembered , was hiding his light under a lieutenancy when Mayor John F Hylan brought it forth to blaze into the dark byways of criminality . One year ago the metropolitan press wanted to " oust " him from office because of the " crime wave . " This year there has been less complaint against Mr. Enright . Hence his speech .
