The Lost Patrol ( British ) . There was material for a masterpiece in the situation of these eleven soldiers on the Sahara desert . They had been riding under sealed orders to an unknown destination . A sniper kills their lieutenant and the Arabs steal their horses . Nothing can save them from dying or being shot down on the colorless sand , under the sun like a furnace door , and die they do , one by one-an artist , a vaudeville trouper , a farmer , a clerk , a wagon driver , a prizefighter , an evangelist . Their reactions to the death sentence and the way in which the sentence is executed on each of them is the subject of The Lost Patrol . <P> Exploitation matter for the picture states that it was made at places in the desert where the temperature was " never less than 120 . " It is too bad that this heat , or something , made Director Walter Summers , known for his competent war newsreels , mess up this opportunity . The characters are never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and incomplete . Best shot : the evangelist going crazy and running out into the desert to die . <P> The Marriage Playground ( Paramount ) . What happens to children in families that have a penchant for divorces was the subject of a novel ( The Children ) by Edith Wharton which this picture reproduces faithfully . Mrs. Wharton 's professional , knowingly maternal sympathy , her bookish characters , even the glossy feeling of her style , are in The Marriage Playground . It is handsomely staged , conscientiously acted , unreal , inane . Numerous precocious stage children do their specialties as Mary Brian , the oldest and best-looking of the family , gives them their cues . Silliest shot : the cocktail council on the beach . <P> Die Meistersinger ( German ) . It is hard to tell whether the story of the cobbler and the city clerk of Nuremberg who loved a girl who loved neither of them would have been better or worse if Wagner 's immortal but cinematically difficult music had been recorded around it . The poetry , of course , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lost , but the silent Meistersinger moves with a light-footedness impossible in grand opera . Clearly these capable German actors like their . material and understand it . They play the old roles slyly , fast and broadly - the whimsical Hans Sachs , the vicious Beckmesser , the hesitating Pogner . Good shots : the fracas outside Hans Sachs ' shop ; Beckmesser appearing before the Grand Council without his toupee . <P> This Thing Called Love ( Path ) . <P> Shrewd rather than witty , this comedy of marriage succeeds in being entertaining because Edwin Burke , from whose play it was adapted , sensibly avoided the deeper implications of his subject . The idea of it is that married people get along better if they are not in love with each other . A girl who has seen her sister become possessive , jealous , dissatisfied because she was in love with her husband , makes a business deal with a gentleman , stipulating that she is to run his home and live with him at a salary of $25,000 and all expenses paid . The reversal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this contract becomes sentimental , shows how eventually she shares the troubles of less reasonable women . Best shot : pretty Constance Bennett making terms .
