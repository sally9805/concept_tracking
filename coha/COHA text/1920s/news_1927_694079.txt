txt Clarence D. Chamberlin , transatlantic pilot , was welcomed home this afternoon to the tiny borough where as Police Recorder Chamberlin he lived for several years . There are nineteen residents in Teterboro , eleven of whom vote . " The vote fluctuates between nine and eleven , " a flag-bedecked and perspiring citizen explained today . " but what 's that got to do with this reception ? " He waved his arm toward a crowd of shouting men , women and children that numbered about seven thousand . When policemen had fought a way clear to push and haul the fair-haired Chamberlin to the platform , the flier took one look around and ' said : " Well , where did all the folks come from ? " Thousands Roar Welcome . A roar went up that must have been heard down in Hudson County and miles across the marshes . Barefooted boys shinned up the posts of the little stand , were pulled down by the legs , and climbed up again . Some one shouted , " Hurray for Clarence ! " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Chamberlin has lived in New Jersey he ? has become well known . Always affable , always ready to explain the mysteries of aviation to the curious and to aid the community in any way he could , Chamberlin realized today how many friends he has made in Bergen County . Citizens . while they were waiting for him , recalled how a year ago he flew , in weather which ordinary fliers would avoid , low over the marshes , day after day , in search of berry pickers who were lost . They told of his search in a like manner for a boy who had been lost in the marshes and of his daring landings and , his stunts which more than once brought protests from the town and village authorities . Policer- Hasbrouck Heights . Hackensack and Jersey City had been commandeered to handle the welcome home of the Chamberlins , for tbn reception was as much for Mrs. Chamberlin as it was for her famous husband . ? All Teterboro on Committee . A committee headed by Mayer E. E. Field of Hasbrouck Heights had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' n towns , Bergen County and the State of New Jersey participated The nineteen citizens of Teterboro were members of the committee , and if one takes into account the difference in size of the two municipalities , Teterboro 's reception to Chamberlin bettered New York 's to Lindbergh . The combined police representatives of ' the State , county , borough and surrounding towns failed to keep the crowd behind roves when the cry , went up . " He 's coming ! " Chief Peter Siccardi of the Bergen County Traffic Police went to New York early this morning and down the bay to meet the Leviathan with orders to " fetch Chamberlin back . " He did . Plans were made to have Chamberlin leave the New York reception early , go to Mitchel Field and fly a plane provided for the occasion by the Wright Aeronautical Company , builders of the Wright Whirlwind engine with which Chamberlin has broken two world 's records and flown across an ocean in the last three months . He and Mrs. Chamberlin , according to the plan , were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fly Home . When Chief Siccardi broached the plan to him aboard the Macom , the flier who bucked storms all one night over Germany and Holland in the Bellanca plane , took one look at the overcast sky and shook his head . " Me fly ? " he remarked , " I guess not ! " So Chief Siccardi took the Chamberlins across the Hackensack meadows by automobile . He drove onto the field at 4:30 . The crowd had waited for more than two hours . At once the machine was surrounded . Police rushed from all directions to help the flier and his wife through the cheering , struggling mob , but the mob rushed faster . They broke down the ropes and swept in a torrent around the car . It was ten minutes before the machine could advance to the steps at the stand and another ten minutes before the Chamberlins were hoisted up where all could see them . Mayor Fields raised his hand to lead a cheer and they cheered . Then he raised it again to beseech silence and they cheered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again the flier . He looked up , squinted and listened intently to the purring motors , but was brought back to earth again when the hundred-piece National Biscuit Company band started " The Star-Spangled Banner . " The hundred bandsmen blew their best but only those standing close by could hear and distinguish the music above the roar of the welcome . As the band played Chamberlin looked over the heads of the crowds across the field behind the gayly bedecked Atlantic Aircraft Company 's factory to the little square concrete building which is Teterboro 's town hall and in which the Chamberlins lived . The Stars and Stripes waved from its stubby flag pole . The town hall is a one-story building about twenty feet on a side . Here Recorder Chamberlin once sat in judgment on those who had offended against the ordinances of the borough . How Chamberlin Tried Case . Today the story was going the rounds that the young aviator-Recorder used to dispense justice in other ways . In front of the town hail is a wooden building in which Chamberlin 's planes and engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clad in overalls , smudged with grease , doctoring up some old plane to make it airworthy . Sometimes his civic duties and his beloved profession clashed . Some minor offenders brought before him by the police were astonished to find themselves being judged by a young man lying on his back beneath a fuselage , who talked between blows of the hammer . The court scene would go something like this : Judge Chamberlin to the prisoner : " Well , did you hit him ? " In the pause the hammer would go tap , tap . ' Yes , " answered the prisoner . Another tap or two of the hammer . " Well , " the story teller quoted Recorder Chamberlin , " I guess you 'll have to pay a fine and if you have n't got any money you 'll have to go to jail . " An effort to find any luckless one who languished in prison after a sentence by Recorder Chamberlin was fruitless . Still , the folks at the field ' vouch for this story and declare that Chamberlin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany . As the band finished " The Star Spangled Banner " Mme. Florence Otis , soprano soloist , stepped forward and sang the second verse . Governor 's Greeting Read . Mayor Field then welcomed Chamberlin in a short speech , during which every period and comma was wildly cheered . tee introduced Brig . Gen. Frederick Gilkyson of the New Jersey National Guard , who rep:a:anted Governor Moore . Genera Gilkyson read part of a letter to Chamberlin from the Governor . " Through Adjt . Gen. Gilkyson , the message read , wish to prc. ; ent my compliments and to extend to yo-.i the heartfelt felicitations of the people of our State upon your fine achievement . In welcoming you 1 ) me we are grateful to Almighty God for returning you safely to your native land . " For some time past you ha ye chosen our State as your State , as your home , and we are proud to have as a fellow-citizen so brave and so distinguished a man and one who has added such a glorious page to national and world-wide history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our National Guard , and trust that when everything is ready you will consider the acceptance of a commission in that branch of the service . " Mayor Field then introduced State Senator W. B. , who was followed by United States District Attorney Walter G. Winne , representing the Borough of Teterboro . J. W. Binder , executive secretary of the Interstate Hudson River Bridge Association and Bergen County Association , wound up the speeches that were planned . The crowd had other plans , however , and Chamberlin , who had spoken twice today in New York , stepped forward reluctantly . Home Greeting " Beats Them All . " For a full minute this flier , who has been welcomed in the last month in thirty European cities and five Old World capitals , was silent I as he looked into the faces of the home folks . A zealous radio man pushed a microphone a little closer to his face and he started , picking up some of the words of Mr. Binder . ' " I hope that I can help Mr. Binder I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to make Teterboro Field one of the best in the country . As for receptions , we have had some good ones , but ' this here beats them all . " As he stopped , the Chamberlin smile spread over his face . Mayor , Field called for three cheers and the crowd gave nine at least . Then friends and neighbors gathered around . Chief Siccardi headed a flying wedge of policemen for the Chamberlins to the stand and made a passageway to his ear . Mrs. Chamberlin , clinging to the arm of her chum , Miss Anne Crowley of Westbury , L. I. , who had met her down the bay in the morning , climbed in first . Another ten minutes passed before Chamberlin could break away . Miss Crowley lives close to Roosevelt Field and it was at her home that Chamberlin had some ham and eggs and a glass of milk on the morning of his takeoff . The car tried to start forward but could n't . The driver looked around and saw behind him the military formation of the band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea and backed . The band spread ranks and the car backed through two lines of sounding brass , but again it was surrounded and did not get under way until a squad of motorcycle policemen forced a path to the road . Find Home Well Cared For . They drove past the little town hall home and stopped for a minute . Some one had mowed the lawn and weeded the flower beds and kept them watered . Neither Chamberlin nor his wife said anything . They took a look and drove on back to New York . The crowd was slow in getting away . It had hoped that Bernt Belches would come out with Chamberlin and wanted to welcome him . Balchen spent many months at Teterboro testing Fokker ships and has many friends in the county and surrounding towns . Another factor delayed many motorists . Parking space had been provided for hundreds of cars , but there was not room enough on solid ground and scores of machines were bogged in the soft ground adjoining the field . A tractor was brought from a near-by farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His sturdy engine and broad wheels enabled many families to get out of the mud and go home ..
