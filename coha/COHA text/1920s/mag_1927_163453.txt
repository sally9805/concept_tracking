It was natural that Michael Faherty , head of Chicago 's subway commission , which is touring Europe on a visit of inspection , should go to London to inspect the " underground . " For even though Mayor William Hale Thompson of Chicago objects to King George V meddling in Chicago politics , he thinks that much may be learned from a study of London 's huge subway &; tube systems . <P> It was therefore natural that Mr. Faherty should meet Lord Ashfield , head of the London subway system . It was just as natural for the warmhearted U. S. Irishman to thank the London official for his kindnesses by tendering him &; his friends &; relatives a luncheon . <P> But when it came to toasting King George V , Mr. Faherty thought of " Big Bill " Thompson away back home and of the pro-British history books that have " corrupted " Chicago schoolchildren . No , he could not go through with it ! <P> " You do it , " he mumbled to Lord Ashfield . <P> Concealing a smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a blow that his surprise was visible . <P> " Gentlemen , " said Lord Ashfield , " PRESIDENT COOLIDGE ! " <P> Astounded that an English lord should propose the health of the U. S. President , Mr. Faherty collapsed limply in his chair , and , dazed , drank to King George V when his health was proposed .
