The mirage dissolved , in the way of dreams that are fair ; dissolved gradually , like one 's faith in a Golden Age ; was forgotten . What to-day are those islands poised in a visionary sea , a sea vast and mute , a sea that is the radiant lower hemisphere of the sky ? They are only sensational stuff for the safe and easy use of hearty novelists and storytellers who require , to make their books move , pirates , trepang , beachcombers , copra , head hunters , pearls , and similar matter which easily takes coal-tar dyes in the rapid output of bright and lusty fudge . They do not exist , otherwise . And the voyage down the Red Sea and across the Indian Ocean was hot and long enough for me to forget where I was going and why I was there . I let the idea of The Islands blow to leeward . I had no use for it . I saw I might as well expect to reach the Hesperides . As a legend , The Islands were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than when my steamer , against the cruel hostility of an English spring , backed into the Mersey and stood out to sea . The legend each day All rights reserved . retired still farther , like good fortune when pursued . That delicate line of the horizon was inviolable . It could not be passed . For Magellan and Drake it was all very well to pursue such ideas . Their ships were different . Mine was a high confusion , looking aft , of white boats , black ventilators with blue throats , indeterminate shapes , ladders coming out of nothing and leading nowhere , a cerulean factory stack , and yellow derrick standards holding out stiff arms above a black central structure which appeared to have no beginning and no end . My ship was too big and complicated for me to be reassured by the scientific design which held it together . And there was the master of our ship . He had grown gray in the East . He knew China and Japan , Java , Sumatra , and Macassar . But he shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were talking to him of a Perfect System or of lost Atlantis . He admitted he had heard of such places . But naturally ! We all have heard , as Raleigh once heard , of the City of Gold . Yet where is it ? Should we waste the time of a practical seaman on his own navigating bridge with idle talk of it ? Raleigh , as we know , found his city . And what was it ? Monkeys and trees . My questions to the captain about The Islands , I can see now , were like an eager display of little green apples to a seaman of long experience . My last question he did not even answer . He could not answer it . A cloud , which had quickly made midnight of the morning ahead of us , burst over the ship . She vanished in hissing smoke . My voice was drowned in the roar of water spouts and the blaring of the siren . Presently she began to take shape again , and through the thinning downpour we could see the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most curiously silent as the black squall passed astern with a white foot to its curtain . The Captain began to answer me when my last question was twenty minutes old . He took off his oilskins . " You talk , " he said , " as if you were on the Underground Railway . Those Islands " ? he waved his arm eastward where there was still only a cobalt haze ? " you could n't see them in a lifetime . Not in two lives . Some are great countries , and some are three coconuts , and the ocean is full of them . They are like the stars in the sky . There 's thousands of them . Now just look at that ! " The now translucent murk of the storm over our starboard bow remained opaque in one place . Part of the weather there had a pyramidal form and was darker . The weather lifted , but this obscurity remained on the sea . Then the sun colored and shaped it as we drew near and what had appeared to be a denser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight out of a cloud to the surf . The summit of the forest was in the heavens , and the combers of the Indian Ocean swung into caverns overshadowed by the trees at its base . " That is the first of them , " said the Captain . " There 's Pulau Way . " I at once abandoned all my stock of notions about the Malay Archipelago . It was useless . I had only that morning found on the chart , for the first time , the island of Way . It was an idle speck lost beside the magnitude of Sumatra . One might have expected to pass Way without seeing it , or perhaps suppose it was a barrel adrift . Yet for twenty minutes we were steaming beside this oceanic dot whose top was hidden in a cloud . Deep ravines and valleys unfolded in it . The palisades of jungle moved past along its water line , or just at the back of an occasional strip of golden beach . I could see but one house , and that was near the eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the illusion of a house . But there was no other sign of humanity . Perhaps Way , too , was a mirage . It had suddenly appeared on the empty ocean , born out of a storm . Now it was passing astern , silent and spectral , apparently no more approachable , this first of the Malay Islands , than any other of those bright dreams which we cherish when young , but which pass , and are lost . To starboard all day among the changing continents of cloud one towering shape Of dark vapor persisted . Our skipper said that that was a mountain top in Sumatra ; but you know what sailors are . Once a nipa palm drifted close to us . It looked much more real than Pulau Way , or than any distant . Sumatran summit . At dinner that night the open rounds of our saloon ports were disks of fathomless violet . When I looked up from the yellow glow of the table lamp to those dim circles I thought we were being steadily scrutinized by the enigmatic eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the talk . The Captain and the Chief Engineer were in solemn dispute . It is in such adventitious trifles , casual and valueless , that one gets the best things in travel . Now and then the violet changed to a vivid and quivering green light . But there was no thunder . The mystery did not speak . We came to the coffee . Our Captain , taking up his white cap from his bench , a sign that he had had enough of us , leaned back , and severely reprimanded the Chief . The Chief , who is a young man , happens to be an insoluble agnostic . He is quietly and obstinately confident in his denial of everything but experience . Our Captain is elderly . He has voyaged long enough to learn that though what men call hard facts must be treated with respect and caution , yet that . one can never be quite sure . " Look at my charts , my Admiralty charts , covered all over with experience . Do I trust them ? No , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You should know that we were discussing whether , when a man dies , he then chiefly lives , or whether , as the Engineer put it , " he goes to the bottom , through the ash-shoot . " Our Captain said he surely did n't know . But he was just as sure that no thumb-polluted , condemned , dog-eared , fuliginous pocket book of formulas used by engineers or anybody else had got it down in plain figures ; or some words of a similar import . " I do n't know . You do n't . Nobody knows . " The Engineer looked at the misty electric fan and made bread pills . His face suggested that he had heard all this from his youth up ; that he knew baffled controversialists invariably escaped from the last corner in such cloudy and sentimental muslin , like an angry woman who is in the wrong , but is pretty . Our Chief would no more accept a Christian statement than he would believe the proffered pearl of a Levantine pedlar was of great price . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than smile faintly at the ease you put , as he would at the pearl . He refers you instead to Darwin , or Huxley. , or Andrew Lang , or the Golden Bough , or Edward Clodd . He has read widely within his favorite province . He goes over every statement separately , with a fine gage , to see whether it will fit accurately into his system . If it does not then away it goes . The Captain had risen slowly over us , lean , tall , and sardonic , and with no sign that he was suppressing himself except that I discovered I was now more interested . in his hard gray eyes than in the ' violet eyes of the tropic night . The Chief at this moment referred the Captain to one of those Victorian iconoclasts whose books load cupboards and chests in his own cabin . The Captain instantly recommended him to a more Rabelaisian diet . In this contest of characters it was curious to note the difference between the well-read logician and the literary temperament . The Captain has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never will . But his candid simplicity , nevertheless , had foreknowledge of much that the Engineer had to tell him , and was unsatisfied . He still insisted on the need and even the common sense of as he called it ? " a margin to play with . " " After all , what do you clever fellows know ? God himself is hidden in what you do n't know . There 's plenty of room . Nobody can tell how much there is beyond the half-dozen pebbles you 've picked up on the beach . " " Nobody , " said the Chief , " has ever come back to us , anyhow . They go , and they do n't come back to us . " " Well , why the hell should they ? " demanded the tall figure at the door , turning its head over its shoulder . " Why should they ? Who would understand ' cm if they did ? Would you ? What they Would tell you would be outside your experience and all wrong , of course . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into vacancy , as if talking to such a man , especially when the man was the ship 's captain , was useless , and he would waste no more time . Lightning glimmered at the ports . The steward upset a plate of fruit . While his eye watched a rolling orange the Captain continued : " There 's more sense in some comic songs than in a lot of your deductions from experience . What have you experienced ? About enough to warn a nipper against playing with fire . " Then he disappeared in the alleyway . The Chief said nothing . With well-disciplined weariness he adjusted his napkin ring to a design in the table cloth . He then looked at me fixedly ? but I gave no sign of partisanship ? and finished his coffee . A long voyage is chiefly weather and gossip . It gives a traveler the impression of being irrelevant and aimless . The men keep busy about the ship because there is nothing else to do . A sullen word , the least significant of unfriendly gestures , are noted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current ; it is so gratuitously alien in its opposition . Travel is delightful in the morning , with a young sari giving the sparkling sense that all is new and for the first time , and that shadows are , after all , but a sport of happy light . By the afternoon that freshness has gone , and one suspects the ship is uselessly rocking without progress , fixed in the clutch of some sleeping but eternal power which has forgotten , or does not know , that men do not live for ever . One would then destroy Time , the tyrant , and with his own scythe , if suddenly he turned into an alleyway hearing his damnable glass . And when , after dinner , there is no longer any excuse for continuing in the saloon ; TO THE ISLES OF KINGS 5G5 when it is three bells , and the boys have got tired of giving the gramaphone on the hatch fox-trots to eat , and you can see the spark by the rail amidships where the Chief 's pipe accompanies him while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , one has to face the ghosts from other times and of vanished scenes winch gather in one 's cabin at that hour , confident that it is their place also , and that the man they know is sure to come soon . And he comes . Hail , the ghosts of the middle watch ! You never signed the articles . You were not seen coming aboard . You never appear on deck . The voyage has nothing to do with you . Nobody but myself knows you haunt us . But are you the reality , or is the ship ? Before the day broke in the Strait of Malacca it looked as though the east were barred from us by the enormous battalions of tempest . They were camped about the horizon , a sleeping but ghastly host , waiting for day to announce the assault and for the wind to lead them . The sea was stilled , as though appalled by the look of the sky . But no wind came with the sun . The dark impending threat did not move upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall on ... which the sooty . streamers were changed to orange and pearl . Here we were , approaching Singapore . We might have reached the peaceful end of the sea ; or perhaps its tranquil beginning , for that delicate surface might never have been broken by any violence . It was enclosed by a circle of islands , some of them high and solid , with deep reflections in the glass , and others but black tracings of minute trees afloat , growing miraculously upright out of the tenuous horizon . A launch turned a point and projected itself at us . Two black lines diverged from its stem widely over a pallid tide . At its head stood the statue of a Malay in a sarong , holding a boat-hook , and the statue became alive as the launch disappeared under our side where a Jacob 's ladder was hanging . And next , a pair of hairy , freckled hands appeared at our bulwarks , and pulled up a man in a suit and helmet incredibly white . He had a sandy beard . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands together to rid them of our ship 's grit , an act which had the air of a polite visitor 's absentminded disapproval . He went by a group of us , this pilot , as though he had been meeting us like this every morning for years , and was rather tired of it , these hot days , but hoped we were all right . To leave the sea and to land at Singapore is as serious a matter as taking a man out of a long seclusion and releasing him from a closed vehicle inRiceadilly Circus . Molten light poured over the swift kaleidoscopic movements of a street where the first thing I saw was a large cart drawn by a small white bull with an excusable hump ; his eyes were full of flies . But no sooner did I note the flies than the hull vanished , or became a Chinaman running silently in front of an austere European lady win : , was perched high on a pair of noiseless wheels . Then a Chinaman began to run silently in front of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of noiseless wheels watching the dark patch of sweat expand on the back of his shirt ; anyhow , I must suppose it was I who sat there . We nearly knocked over a yellow lady in black-satin trousers and a blue jacket who was smoking a cigarette . Next , so far as I remember , there were a great manymasters of ships and perhaps as many cocktails . We came to a spacious blackand-white palace with a myriad propellers revolving on its ceiling ? no wonder I was dizzy ? and a string quartette regulated our hunger with dance music while a regiment of immaculate Celestial acolytes accurately guessed our wants . I remember , that night , a confusion of narrow alleys , where hanging lanterns disclosed endless and aimless torrents of brown bodies . There were the rank smells of abundant life in heat and ferment , and cries and voices without meaning . Above grotesque cornices were the shapes of monstrous leaves blacking out areas of stars . All this , when I found a bedroom , I tried to resolve into an orderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upburst and overflow of life at its source . I gave it up , and watched instead some lizards running after one another upside down on the white ceiling , while they made a noise like intermittent loud kissing . Next morning the same sun was there again . I escaped from the heat and the bewildering life of Singapore into a shaded office . Its windows opened south and east to a glowing panorama of ships , clouds , and islands . The long traffic of that office with the Orient had settled into a tradition of intent ease which seemed the same as cool leisure . A mounted telescope projected from an open window toward the anchorage . A man stood there with straddled legs , watching a ship coming in . He left it and came to me , talked familiarly , dabbing his forehead with a handkerchief , of America , England , China , and Japan ; he spoke even of Java . But when I mentioned such places as Lombok , Flores , and Gillolo , he picked up a massive shell which was keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined it as though he hoped to divine from it what I wanted to know . The shell did not help him . Only one thing became certain : the Moluccas were as far from Singapore as that city is from New York . It was even easier to get to New York . I discovered , at Singapore , that to talk there of Timor and Halmahera was as profitless as asking a policeman at Charing Cross the way to the Faroes . It would he tactless and inconsiderate to embarrass the friendly fellow with such a question . I was shown , through the office telescope , a Dutch steamer at anchor in the roads . She was bound , so I gathered , for Java and the outer blue . She would be away for months , and she might go , according to fate and local coconuts , to some of the islands I had named Why not board her , and see what happened ? There is much to he said , when traveling , for keeping a mind as open and doubtful as to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiating a peace treaty ; and more still for not caring . .1 boarded that Dutchman , the Same , went into an empty cabin , and waited . Her windlass began at once to labor with the anchor , as though she had been waiting for me . The picture of distant Singapore began to revolve across my cabin port . That settled it . Now it was certain I should have to take whatever came . On the very next morning , for the first time since that fateful year when Europe developed an acute mania for frantic speed , aerial torpedoes , delirious bankruptcy , and stentorian lmoadcasting , I could feel a distinct lessening of humanity 's vibrations . My own pulse showed signs of becoming normal . We were threading the Rhio and Linga islands , and the Dutch captain put , his head in the cabin to inform me that we were crossing the line . I knew it , by instinct . But which line did he mean ? Anyone could guess that we were in another world . Certainly we had already crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the sea and the sky . They were greatly changed . It was surprising they tolerated our steamer at all ; but perhaps we had blundered unobserved across this line . The light of that morning might have been shining undimmed since things began . There was something terrifying in its exalted and innocent splendor . Even the islands were but tinted vapors , and whether they were in the sea or in the air it was not easy to say . The isle of Banka , great asit was with its mountains , was certainly not in the sea . It had light beneath it . It was translated above that plain of turquoise ; and I imagined that under the mauve masses of its hills , and under the thin peninsula of miniature black trees which was prolonged from the foot of a mountain over the sea , unsupported , fragile , and miraculous , I could peer far into profound nothing . But Banka must have been land , a great island , for over it was a dense and involved region of genuine cloud , bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight of ages . Now I know quite well , for I have seen ships before , and understand their purpose , that , amidst all that unearthly light and color , my Dutch captain was going to look for copra , gums , rattans. nutmegs , mace , delves , and cinnamon . He looked like the man to find them , too . He was small , but hard , heavy , and quick . His eyes were pale blue , but I guessed his temper was quite another dye , and not in the least pale . He was not the sort of man to whom one might romantically suggest that those islands had nothing in them but beauty , and nothing under them but immaterial hues ? not , anyhow , while there was so much evidence of wicked reefs almost . alongside the empty ship which he hoped to load with copra and such , at the current rates , before he turned about . Yet at times I half suspected that even he did not know where he was . I myself lost count . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charts . One day we would be sweltering in a harbor of Java , taking in only Heaven knows what except mosquitoes which could bite through india rubber . My cabin having been filled with flies like devils and moths like jewels , we would put to sea again , suddenly , and for no apparent reason ; though that did not matter , because , as time passed ? there being no more days and weeks ? I could watch the immense peaks of the twin islands of Lombok and Bali , two volcanoes rising sheer from the sea and parted by a narrow strait , supernal and terrible , and alone the full value of the longestvoyage . We put out from Lombok ; and that night the Chief Officer , after what sounded to me like a distressing altercation with his Captain , but probably was nothing but the most loving Dutch , turned to me and began reciting , in English which made the original poem the more remarkable , Kipling 's " Ballad of the Mary Gloucester . " I stopped the soup , and listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " An ' now Mister Tomlinsohn , you will wonder why T do this . " The Dutchman gazed at me earnestly ; though not with greater earnestness than I gazed at him , for he had remembered every word of it , and more . " It is yoost because we are by the Paternosters , where he drop his wife . " Could hospitality go farther ? Is there an English or an American literary critic , not . to mention a mere sailor , who could do that with a Dutch poem ? In the wide world , not one . There was no time to resolve these surprises before we were in Macassar ; and Macassar , like Singapore , deserves more than a postscript . In Macassar , because a . Chinese merchant became slightly hysterical when I mentioned Limehouse , I did not board the ship again till I forget when , and woke late , after what I remembered vaguely as a dream of old Pekin . The Chinese , too , are most hospitable , but they should break themselves of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked out from the cabin window Macassar had vanished . We were , of course , at sea again . ( Sometimes we would anchor four times in the day . Three huts and a clump of coconuts in an otherwise uninhabited island were sufficient to induce our captain to stand-in and get out a boat . ) This time , so far as I could make out , we were steering for nothing but a cloud kingdom , the vision of a celestial war . Our Ship stood toward the presentiment of the sack and ruin of a high city , with its battlements tumbled and in flames , its streets of jasper smoking , and the banners of its defeated hosts sinking to final confusion and darkness . A native prau was coining from there , its sails spread like a pair of gigantic wings too big for its body , and perhaps it was bearing survivors in urgent flight . Nothing else was in sight . We never reached that city . The Same was next at anchor in a little hay . She was encircled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creation . I asked no questions but went ashore , and entered that forest , where-ever it was , and whatever its name . Nothing was there . The trees , I suppose , were real , though they gave no more sign of life than prehistoric monoliths . A slight noiseless rain and myself had the forest to ourselves . No doubt rain there was always adding to the gloom ; the rain might have been only the gentle precipitation of the silence . While peering into the shadows which deepened in a hollow , some lower , branches crashed , and an orang-utan swung out to look at me . ( Ah , yes ; though I hardly believed it myself , even at the time , so you need not trouble to believe it at all . ) We stared at each other for about five seconds , and then he lurched off in an explosion of breaking boughs . That settled it . I was in Borneo . From there we crossed over to Celebes , another great island , but of quite an original character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the narrow gulfs which penetrated so far among mountains abrupt and impossible with jungle , anchoring wherever the chrysolite of some coconuts was a landmark in the somber olive-green of the forest , that I grew uncertain whether Celebes was one island or an archipelago in itself , or whether we had left Celebes and had found another group . But we reached at last its far northeastern corner , the land with its delightful name of Minahassa , where the pleasant people and the extravagant foliage almost persuaded rue that it might have been worth Adam 's while to have kept to the Garden of Eden . Yet once more our Dutch captain wanted only copra or anything else that might be worth having on the beach ? and when he got it he did not stay for beauty , but brayed his peremptory siren for loiterers and put to sea again . We continued east , passed through the Sangi Islands one sunset ? eyries for the Sulu pirates a few years ago ? and entered the Molucca Passage . I remained on deck , kept there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philippines the survivors of that most remarkable of voyages came south to the Moluccas , The Islands of the Kings , " and sheltered at Ternate . Ternate is a word like Samarkand and Cathay . To the Elizabethans it meant the splendor at the world 's end , and the most a sailor could do . I had the deck to myself at midnight , and the boatswain birds , which are said to be the restless souls of dead mariners , were making plaintive and melancholy cries about us in the dark . Sometimes one of them would pass like a ghost through the ray of the light in our fore-top . The unseen surge was chanting quietly of what men had done , and of what men had forgotten . Our ship , I felt , was at the end of time , was at the verge of all the seas , and herself was but the shadow of a memory drifting under strange stars in a quest for what man will never find again . But we did discover at sunrise that Gillolo , or Halmahera ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a premonition ahead . It was a shadow of lilac behind which were monstrous billows of vapor that could have rolled from a fire which had been immense , but was extinct . The volumes of smoke , and that sea of tarnished silver , had been stilled . Nothing had moved here since the last of the old navigators sailed westward . Nearer than Halmahera and straight out of the plain of silver soared the two austere volcanic peaks , high and dark , of Ternate and Tidore . Whether Ternate 's fires were alight , or whether the coming day had merely kindled a cloud at itssummit , it was hard to say . Some native praus were about , poised on outspread wings ; but I thought they were abandoned , or were under a spell , for they did not move , but remained in one place between sky and sea ; held fast by their reflections , perhaps . I could believe Ternate was substantial only when we began to creep beneath the forests of its slopes , and a Malay sailor recalled me to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . We moored alongside the village , and could see the coral under our ship in the clear fathoms . Yet the more light the rising sun poured into that bay formed by mountainous islands , the greater became my incredulity . It might still have been a scene in an old story . The weight of the tropic sun did not break the spell . And when later the Same blared for loiterers , I refused to answer her . I remained on the beach ? at Ternate , and watched her steam away .
