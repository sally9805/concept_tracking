From the bleak little Siberian town of Habarovsk flashed news last week of an informal meeting between one Tsai Yun-shen , representing China-and one Simbn-ovsky , Soviet . Deploring the Sino-Russian dispute , they signed a peace protocol . The terms : Immediate restoration of joint management of the Chinese Eastern Railway ( cause of all the strife ) ; withdrawal of the Soviet army from Manchuria ; mutual release of civilian and military prisoners ; mutual reopening of consulates ; a formal conference at Moscow , Jan. 25 , to settle all questions still under dispute . World chancelleries took note , awaited word of the Moscow agenda . <P> " Whew ! " Wasp-waisted little President Chiang Kai-shek of China made a proclamation last week which resembled nothing so much as a long shrill " Whew ! " The President was voicing his relief at his success as a field-marshal in beating off and vanquishing , at least for a time , the armies of war lords opposed to his regime ( TIME , Oct. 14 , et seq ) . Whewed he : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our fate hung by a single hair . What was this hair ? The loyalty and bravery of our officers and men , whose courage never faltered ! Again they met the flood and carried us to firm ground . " ( Floods are the most frequent catastrophe in China , others scarcely less frequent being droughts and plagues . ) <P> Good Little God . In Mukden , capital of the great northern Province of Manchuria , Governor-General Chang Hsueh-Liang had sufficient respite from war last week to entertain in sumptuous fashion that good little god , the Panchen Lama or " Living Buddha , " devoutly venerated by millions of Chinese Buddhists . <P> For convenience sake the Panchen Lama might be called the " Buddhist Pope , " and the Dalai Lama the temporal pontiff of Tibet . Just at present these two most holy persons are at outs , the Sovereign Dalai Lama holding his court at Lhasa , Tibetan capital , and the Panchen Lama roving about war-torn China with the immunity and pomp of a walking deity . In honor of this little man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an invigorating banquet was tendered by Governor-General Chang at which hot tiger 's blood was drunk . <P> Godsend . The consuls of Britain , France , Japan , Germany and the U. S. who set out in a special train last fortnight to investigate conditions in the recent Russo-Chinese battle area in Manchuria ( TIME , Dec. 23 ) chuffed back to Harbin last week , having been refused permission to visit the area they sought . " I am personally convinced , " wired a Japanese correspondent who accompanied the party , " that neither the Russians nor the Chinese wanted us to see what is happening . "
