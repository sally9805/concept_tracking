Noisy , dirty , impolite , Nobody loves a Buchmanite . <P> - Princeton Song . <P> The patient votaries of that curious collegiate cult called " Buchmanism , " received last week one of the rebuffs upon which they thrive . The Oxford Isis published a scornful editorial which spoke of " restraint flung aside . . . souls laid bare . . . hysterical confessions . . . fervor which no longer pretends to be religious . . . perverted religious mania . . . " and concluded with these stern and sober words : <P> " The authorities appear to be alarmed but remain apathetic . It is time something is done about it . Accordingly , we take this opportunity of asking the university authorities to remove from Oxford those who are responsible for the phenomenon , which would be faintly comic were it not apt to produce such extremely unpleasant results . " <P> Buchmanism , in its essentials , is easily seen as an adaptation of Christianity which contains many features of traditional excellence . Conversion , contemplation , confession-upon these it lays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous and has caused its founder , Frank N. D. Buchman , Muhlenburg graduate and Lutheran minister , to be called ugly names . At Buchman " houseparties " ( gatherings devoted to mutual confession and " washing out " ) , sex is the pice de rsistance . Mr. Buchman and his assistants are accused of reducing their diagnoses of spiritual sufferings to bad sex habits . The weak-chinned element in schools and colleges , full of relief at finding so plain a focal point for their self-betterment ambitions or so simple a seeming cause for all their adolescent agonies , succumb readily to the " spiritual surgery " which follows this easy diagnosis . <P> The ranks of Buchmanism are by no means filled with the sons of the humble ; the founder of the sect has an attraction if not a predilection for the rich and for crowned heads . His influence upon the members of the Royal House of Rumania has been marked and apparent . Queen Marie , at whose palace Frank Buchman has made long visits , talks with the fetching lack of reserve which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak-chinned Prince Nicholas , one of the regents of Rumania and uncle to small <P> King Mihai , is an ardent disciple of his mother 's friend . <P> Last week 's outcry at Oxford bears a close resemblance to the events which preceded Dr. Buchman 's expulsion from the campus of Princeton , four years ago . At Oxford , however , there are perhaps not more than 75 Buchmanites of whom several are dons . After the outcry , the authorities made no move , undergraduates exhibited a lackadaisical approval , and Buchmanites continued to hold their " morning watches , " and to move in their mysterious ways .
