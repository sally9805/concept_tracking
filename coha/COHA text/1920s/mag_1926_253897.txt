Knew Not <P> Sirs : <P> I thoroughly enjoy TIME , but I do not read every paragraph in the magazine from cover to cover . That may account for my singular ignorance which other readers of TIME may not possess . <P> But while I may be ignorant I kind of hate to have It rubbed in . <P> I refer to your issue of Aug. 30 , wherein you preface various remarks by stating " As everyone knows . " These words slapped me in the face four different times while reading your magazine last night . <P> I did not know that the White House icebox was a primitive one of shaggy lumber . <P> I did not know that the Diskonto Gesellschaft is one of the four great " D Banks " of Germany . <P> I did not know that Prince Chichibu of Japan has wintered and disported himself in Switzerland , and that he has survived an ankle strained while skating and ensuing measles . <P> I did not know that Gregory Zinoviev was expelled during the summer from the potent Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few other readers who did not know these great universal facts , and who dislike being singled out as the only one who was ignorant of them . <P> You need not cancel my subscription , however . <P> <P> HENRY W. DUNN <P> Long Beach , Calif . <P> <P> Twisters <P> Sirs : <P> I am much interested in the inclosed piece of information relative to cyclones from TIME , Aug. 30 . It does not however go far enough . What happens when a waterspout crosses the equator ? Does it stop suddenly and start spinning in the opposite direction ? Or does it die of convulsions ? Or What ? I shall be obliged if you will inform me . . . . <P> <P> W. H. HARKNESS <P> Glen Cove , L. I. <P> <P> TIME stated that cyclones spin counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere , clockwise in the southern , due to twist imparted to enveloping air currents by Earth 's axial motion ( Ferrel 's law ) . No record is discoverable of the hypothetical case posed by Subscriber Harkness . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cyclone usually travels away from the Equator . Should one chance to be translated across the Line it would theoretically be retarded , dissipated , replaced by a fresh one of reverse spin. - ED . <P> <P> Sirs : <P> The writer , a recent subscriber to TIME , looks forward each week to the receipt of your periodical , primarily for the wide scope of news it disseminates , its brevity and accuracy . Imagine my surprise when reading your Aug. 30 issue I found a mistake in nomenclature quite prevalent among our country 's press , that is , terming tornadoes , cyclones . " . . . <P> Under " Meteorology " in Volume XVIII Encyclopaedia Brittanica , page 284 , at the end of the second column in referring to cyclones , I find : " The term cyclone among meteorologists . . . is equivalent to the older usage of whirlwind , and it is unfortunate that misunderstandings often arise because local usages in America apply the word cyclone to what has for centuries been called a tornado . " <P> The above is sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receiving your future issues and recommend it to my friends . <P> <P> BRADNER W. LEE JR . <P> <P> Los Angeles , Calif . <P>
