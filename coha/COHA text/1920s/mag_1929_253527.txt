Tennis elders did not waste much time shaking their heads over the defeat of William Tatem Tilden II in straight sets in the finals of the Brooklyn Heights indoor invitation tennis tournament last week , his first competition since his reinstatement as an amateur . Instead , all eyes were on his conqueror , John Van Ryn , now definitely a Davis Cup hope . Van Ryn , who ranks sixth in the land , not only defeated No. 1 Tilden but also No. 2 Francis T. Hunter in the course of the week . <P> " Bill has n't been playing very much lately , " was Van Ryn 's explanation . But still the elders did not care . They decided that Van Ryn looked like a potential national champion as well as Davis Cup timber-and a modest champion , at that . <P> Aged 22 , 5 ft. 10 in. , 155 lbs. , slim faced , freckled , agile , Van Ryn is Princeton 's pride . He was graduated last year . He will probably grow no taller and , because he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smashes and forehand drives are orthodox and highly accurate . Last week in Brooklyn he revealed a new ( for him ) half-volley which frequently caught the aging Tilden flatfooted . In addition he has an aggressiveness nerve-wracking to the man across the net . <P> An important thing about Van Ryn is that he is well-to-do . He will scarcely be tempted to flirt with trouble by writing for the newspapers . His family likes having a first-rate sportsman in the family and he is afforded ample time and allowance to play and practice . He arrived at the Brooklyn tournament fresh from four months of serious tennis training in California . " The only thing , " said an oldtime linesman watching the Van Ryn-Tilden match , " that can stop that lad is some blame girl . I hope he 's a constitutional bachelor ! "
