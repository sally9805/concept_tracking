Prior to 1919 practically all wine grapes in this country were purchased by a few wineries . With the advent of prohibition laws , winegrowers feared that their occupation was ruined . But in this they reckoned without the demand supplied by many thousands of amateur makers of " home brew " wines . <P> Apparently as much wine is consumed in this country as ever . Prohibition laws have simply changed the outward forms by which wines are made . The tonnages of wines carried by leading railroads , for example , have shrunk rapidly toward zero . The Southern Pacific , which in 1917 carried 450,287 tons of wine , and in 1919 about 230,000 tons , in 1923 transported only 49,946 tons . So too the Santa Fe carried 167,535 tons in 1917 , 94,181 in 1919 and 21,623 tons in 1923 . <P> At first this shift led to a great increase , if not overproduction of raisins , accompanied by a fall in prices . In 1919 the raisin crop of 182,500 tons was worth $210 a ton , or $38,325,000 . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton , or $18,960,000 altogether . <P> The tonnage of California wine grapes during recent years is also . interesting in this connection . In 1919 , the tonnage of the crop was 400,000-valued at $20,000,000 , or $5 a ton . Production then fell to 375,000 tons in 1920 , and to 310,000 tons in 1921 , while prices rose to $75 and $82 respectively . But at this point the " home brew " wine maker apparently got busy . In 1922 the crop jumped to 450,000 tons , and last year was 428,000 tons , despite a severe rail-dew . Meanwhile prices fell to $65 in 1922 and to $40 last year .
