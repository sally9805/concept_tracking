txt A German paper mark measures three inches and three-quarters by two inches and three-eighths , or threeeighths of an inch wider than this column of The Wall Street Journal , and fifteen printed leaded lines of it deep . As there are 1,296 square inches in a yard and the present exchange value of a paper mark is about one and one-third of a cent , or , to be exact , .0134 of a dollar , this gives a wall-paper price , per square - yard , of $1.95 . This would not be an unreasonable price for artistic wall paper , not including the wages of the paperhanger , if the paper mark were artistic , - which it is n't . The paper itself is tough and serviceable . It stands to reason that when a country 's currency has depreciated to this nominal figure , when what ' was once equivalent to a quarter is now worth little more than a cent , the people of Germany or Austria , to say nothing of Russia , are driven back to primitiVe barter : A reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and competent Austrian woman cook , - says she wants to go back to Austria in spite of all he has told her , from his personal knowledge , of conditions there . She says , however , that her own people are truck gardeners , near Vienna , and have been in that occupation for generations . They say they are not feeling the pinch of poverty . Having something of real wealth to exchange they can live well by barter . They exchange ' their fruit and vegetables with the butcher , the grocer , the seller of such clothes as they need , with the man ' who has a surplus of fuel and needs vegetables . The condition is tolerable because they pay their taxes with paper money , and they can get that almost for the asking . It can be employed , moreover , to pay for any public utility the government or municipality provides , like transportation , water or even lighting . But obviously this is a condition becoming impossible in the central European countries , where the population has become at least two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases in geometrical ratio because , with other reasons , the taxes collected in such a form arc useless in meeting the expenses of government . What happens is that the country is reduced to barter , the currency is wiped out , and after a cataclysm involving national and wide individual bankruptcy a new structure is erected based upon real wealth . It is reassuring to remember that the loss in depreciation is something which the citizens owe to each other . It is a partnership obligation and not a mortgage held by outsiders .. It .. might . almost be said that , after the process of liquidation , a country need not be long in getting on : le feet provided its external debts are not too large for Or . " people to carry in any conditions of future ' prosperity and solvency . The bearing of this on indemnities and reparations should be sufficiently obvious . German destruction of France 's coal mines has resulted in discovery of more deposits , which is more than burning the sty to get roast pork .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
