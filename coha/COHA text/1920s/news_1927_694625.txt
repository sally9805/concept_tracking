txt Official announcement that the Italian paper currency will be immediately stabilized , with a gold valuation for the lira fractionally below the exchange market 's present quotation , surprises partly because of the suddenness of the step , but chiefly because of a lately prevalent belief that a higher valuation would be fixed . The Italian Government 's purpose to stabilize the lira was publicly declared months ago . The sole uncertainty concerned the rate at which revaluation would be effected . In 1926 the lira , swept down with the French and Belgian franc in the currency crisis of that year , had fallen from about 4 cents to less than 3% ? Strong measures I taken by the Government , after the break was checked in August of last year , brought the price up until nearly 45s cents was reached last December , and from this it rose to as high a price as 5% last June .

This lowering of the rate is contrary to recent expectation ; foreign markets had held the view , not discouraged by the Italian Treasury , that after officially checking the further rise of the lira last June a period would be allowed for the community to adjust itself to the new scale of commodity prices , after which further appreciation of the currency might be permitted . The Government 's sudden action is undoubtedly due to the state of Italian industry . The lira 's rapid advance from the low price of August , 1926 , caused equivalent continuous de , dine in prices of commodities .

In Italy as in France , trade was disorganized by this continuing deflation . From 79,678 in July , 1926 , the number of unemployed in Italy had risen in December to 181,463 . The increase has subsequently been slight , and for a time it came to be believed that the " revaluation crisis " was surmounted . But the continuous fall of commodity prices ' has evidently convinced the Mussolini Government that business must be entirely reassured against another marking up of the lira and another consequent deflation process . Whether Italy 's decision will hasten action on the franc by the Poincare Government may be doubted .

It can hardly be assumed , however , that the fixing by the Italian Government of a higher valuation will affect the action of France . The policy of the Bank of France in purchasing at the fixed rate of slightly less than 4 cents all foreign exchange bills offered during the past eleven months has resulted in the accumulation of an enormous credit fund on foreign markets . To raise the official stabilized value of the franc above the price at which those purchases were made would necessarily place the bank in the position of having acquired these new assets at a higher price than they could represent after official revaluation . It would require an equivalent scaling down of assets amounting to nearly $1,000,000,000.                    @
