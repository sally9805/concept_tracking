After a night and day with President Coolidge , Nominee Hoover took leave of Wisconsin and set off again for California , for home . He took with him : <P> Assurance that the President would not accept his resignation as Secretary of Commerce until next month . <P> Assurance that the President would help towards his election through the medium of speeches this autumn about the excellence of the Coolidge Administration , including the Coolidge Cabinet . <P> Advice from a President to a would-be President to mind one 's health . <P> The decision that Prosperity and Integrity are to be the campaign Issues . <P> After Wisconsin , the next State entered by the Nominee was Minnesota . He took leave of the President at Superior , Wis. , and motored around the lakeshore to nearby Duluth. * Governor Theodore Christiansen , " Minnesota 's Mellon , " + was not on hand to welcome him , but many another Minnesotan was . After 142 actual shakes and 47 separate waves of the Nominee 's hand , Duluth yielded its visitor and the Hoover special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait , the Nominee revealed himself as more and more of a politician . The train entered Iowa- " Hoover 's Iowa " - soon after sunup next morning . Waiting at the town of Missouri Valley was tall , bronzed Governor John Hammill of Iowa . He climbed aboard and after the Nominee had roused , dressed and breakfasted , conferred for two hours on matters agricultural . <P> Iowa 's Republicans were holding their state convention that day in Des Moines . Two days before , the Corn Belt Committee , a body of Farmers ' Friends originally organized by Governor Hammill , had met in Des Moines and excoriated the Republican national platform and candidates , applauded and endorsed the Democratic . Professional agitation obviously underlay this Cornbelting . Governor Hammill 's plan , which he carried out dramatically , was to get off the Hoover train at Omaha , give out a resoundingly enthusiastic pro-Hoover interview , hurry into a waiting airplane , fly across Iowa to Des Moines , drive to the Republican convention hall , enter , mount the platform and announce that Nominee Hoover was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the next President , that he would meet his " imperative obligation " ( farm relief ) in a constructive way , beginning with the Federal Farm Board promised in the G. 0 . P. platform . The convention , already primed by a keynote speaker , responded joyfully with a resolution of " supreme confidence " in Nominee Hoover . Iowa 's vote was sure for Nominee Hoover by a 200,000 majority , said Governor Hammill . <P> Leaving Omaha , the Hoover special set out across Nebraska and , after 40 minutes , picked up that State 's Governor , plump , polite Adam McMullen , at the station in
