for in the maintenance of world peace today . Five years ago peace in Europe was a question . Today it is a fact . What has made the difference more than any one element has been the substitution of cooperation in developing the vast natural wealth of the USSR for the policy of isolating the USSR from the economic life of Europe . You in America want peace . So do we . You want freedom of commercial intercourse on realistic bases . So do we . You want a modus vivendi in the Far East that will conduce to permanent peace and the stability and hap  --  piness of the Chinese people . So do we . We have so much in common that it would seem eminently desirable that our two countries work together to these ends . The French Government , in a similar situation , delegated M. de Monzie to make a study of the bases for possible negotiations be  --  fore any official negotiations were entered into . If the President of the United States should delegate some man or group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In the Driftway WHEN the Drifter went to school , football was played by young men in blazers and shorts who kicked a theoretically round though imperfectly inflated ball from one to another along the ground , accompanied by a lot of shouting and a lot of fun . The game was played for the joy of it , and the few spectators who stood along the side  --  lines  --  in bustles or in standing collars which crossed ' over in front  --  did not matter very much . Winning , as ever in human history , was sweet , but even losing was a jolly good game . There were no hired coaches , there were no tower  --  ing stadia , there were no Nijinski cheer leaders , there was no press box , there were no butter-and-egg men , over-ginned and over-raccoon coated , waving the flags of colleges they had never attended , there were no gate receipts , no scouts among the high schools , no odds upon the stock ex  --  changes , no endowment funds embossed on pigskin , no electrically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no massed capital in the background . It was an open game . * * * C * NOW the Drifter does not doubt that applying to foot  --  ball the soundly tested rules upon which the Steel Corporation was formed makes for bigger and better business . The railroads add to their passenger earnings , the manufacturers of bunting and rattan can not but rejoice , the hot-dog industry is greatly stimulated , the curve of gasoline consumption rises sharply , innkeepers prepare to add their quota to investments in Florida real estate , and bootleggers make merry in Rolls Ttoyces . Nor does the Drifter doubt that the Roman holiday gives pleasure to vastly more people than ever lined the playing fields of his youth . But of the game , and particularly the players of the game , he must confess to some perplexity . When Master George Owen of Harvard College says that all the fun has vanished , the Drifter feels a load upon his heart . While Master Harold Grange , late of the University of Illinois , with a half million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What can a young man do when he faces intrenched commercialism , the mob , and the newspapers who live by inflaming the mob ? Where shall the joy of the game , aye , the very freedom of the soul itself , find surcease here ? Down he must go , under the heels of the mob , under the muddy boots of the money changers , under the namelessobscenities of newspaper publicity . And down into the dust goes all that is clean and fine in sportsmanship . With the passage to official professionalism , the story becomes even sadder . Was Master Grange ever booed from the field while he played with his college mates ? He was not . But in Boston and Pittsburgh , playing as a professional , he has been booed and jeered . Why ? Because the trade goods he had to offer did not warrant the price paid , in the opin  --  ion of the consumer . As an incorporated business service furnishing raw material for moving-picture producers , cigarette manufacturers , garment makers , and radio dis  --  tributors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the next friend of all the headline writers in the land , he must face the quite terrible responsibility of meeting the demands of the market . * * * FOR sport that is spontaneous and unfettered , the Drifter has only the most profound respect . For the massed phalanxes of big business he must , if he is to remain a citizen of the greatest republic ever heard of , maintain an attitude of respectful attention , if not of un  --  qualified applause . But when the new wine of business en  --  terprise is poured into the old bottles of sportsmanship the result , from the standpoint of one who knows his vin  --  tages , can only be disaster and the destruction of values . THE DRIFTER Correspondence Publishers Will Be Publishers To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sill : Since The Nation is our only source of news at our dog and goat ranch up country , we know nothing that The Nation does n't know , and get all excited over the things , con  --  ditions , hopes , and fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cities I looked into the picture-paper menace as described in The Nation 's article The Picture Papers Win . And for once I was disappointed in The Nation . The writer of the article had pointed out the picture papers as something new , something departing from the ideals of journalism , some  --  thing vaguely horrendous and threatening . They were offer  --  ing huge sums of money for new circulation ; they were cutting the heart out of the news of the day and substituting pictures , he cried . But this picture-paper idea is all old stuff , as anyone but a provincial , spat-wearing New Yorker ought to know . The rest of the country has had it for twenty-five years to my own knowledge , and nothing very disastrous has resulted from it . I refer now to the country weeklies and the small-town dailies , which are made up largely of boiler-plate pictures of every  --  thing under the sun and which , periodically , to garner a few hundreds of circulation , offer prizes  --  premiums , as they are called . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls for no more insanity , sporting blood , or wealth in your town than the careless bestowal of a set of dishes by the cir  --  culation manager of the newspaper in a certain village that I could name . Yes , the picture papers disappoint me . They are just about like the regular issue of our town 's Bee and Visitor except that in New York the girls seem to wear their dresses a little shorter . Our little pnper has all the puzzles , jokes , funny pictures ; and the photographs of society people , mur  --  derers , and politicians  --  and not much of anything else . The little paper I speak of has given away in varying quantities in the last few years , its circulation manager tells me , the following articles : dishes , jack-knives , berry spoons , pickle forks , lamps , clocks , books , kitchenware , fountain pens , horsewhips , Ford tires , gold-hilted toothpicks , hatchets , axes , bowie-knives , and vanity cases . And these gifts were n't striven for , as prizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May I mention , without offense , that The Nation lately seems to carry more illustrative matter than ever ; to print more emphatic headlines on its front cover ; to offer more tempting subscription bargains ? Publishers will be publishers . Brookline , Massachusetts , November 12 ? MARK TRIVET Speed- Murder To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sin : One of the causes of the French Revolution , one of the things which exasperated the Parisians to the point of frenzy , was the fact that " the fierce aristocrats " recklessly drove over " the people " in the streets of Paris with their car  --  riages . Charles Dickens describes such an outrage in . " A Tale of Two Cities , " from which I quote , here , in an abbre  --  viated form ; With a wild rattle and clatter , and an inhuman aban  --  donment of consideration not easy to be understood these days , the carriage dashed through the streets and swept round corners . At last , swooping at a street corner by a fountain , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a loud cry from a number of voices and the horses reared and plunged . But for the latter inconvenience , the carriage probably would not have stopped ; carriages were often known to drive on and leave their wounded behind . " What has gone wrong ? " said Monsieur , calmly look  --  ing out . A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses , and laid it on the base  --  ment of the fountain , and was down in the mud and wet , howling over it , like a wild animal . " Pardon , Monsieur the Marquis ! " said a ragged and submissive man , " it is a child . " " Why does he make that abominable noise ? Is it his child ? " " Excuse me , Monsieur the Marquis  --  it is a pity  --  yes . " " It is extraordinary to me , " said Monsieur , " that you people can not take care of yourselves and your children . One or the other of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here appeals to our sympathy and indig  --  nation against the reckless killing of one child . In the City of New York , today , people are being killed by automobiles in exactly the same manner , with just such mad speed and reck  --  less swooping round corners , at the rate of very nearly a thou  --  sand a year , including three hundred children ; and some of our autoists , like Dickens 's marquis , want to know why they do n't get out of the way ? Chicago , October 31 BERTRAND SLIADWELL The Coal Strike from Inside To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : I am renewing my subscription to your paper , which I have subscribed for for these many years . I read it regularly and with the greatest respect for your editorial opinions . Sometimes I think you are not familiar with sufficient facts on which to base your opinions , the present anthracite situation being a fair sample of what I have in mind . The consumers of anthracite coal demand certain sizes of coal known to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stove , " etc . During the process of preparation of these sizes a large part of the coal is reduced to a fine condition known as " buckwheat " and " bug dust . " This coal is the same chemically as the larger sizes , but the consumer refuses to buy it . Eventually largequantities of this fine coal accumulate and glut the storage capacity of the industry . There is a large money investment as well . As long as the industry keeps in motion the stock of fine coal accumulates until all storage capacity is full . A sus  --  pension of operations becomes desirable and even necessary . The management of this industry consists of men like ourselves . They are placed by boards of directors , who in turn represent stockholders , who want dividends . If too much money is tied up in fine coal and additional storage capacity it is hard on dividends . Our business system requires divi  --  dends and , , moreover , it now demands the elimination of waste as far as possible . This fine coal should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The industry eventually comes to a place when a suspension is necessary . As long as the con  --  sumer can get the larger sizes of coal lie will not use the fine coal . Shall it be a shut-down , with the miners locked out , or a strike ? A shut-down with a lockout would make the sale of the fine coal a difficult matter . A strike makes the sale easy and more profitable . Which would you or your readers prefer in the business you are engaged in ? Your own business . Not the other fellow 's . The anthracite strike will be adjusted when the fine coal is disposed of . New York and New England are the large users of anthracite . It seems to be up to them . Pittsburgh , December 1 J. R.

" Provably " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would not ask for the correction of this word except for the fact that much of the force of my argument rests upon it . Today , as in the fourth century , the difference of a small letter of the alphabet may make a vast difference in the expression of human intention . Newark , N. J. , December 5 ROWLAND F. NYE Lives of Great Men To THE EDITOR OF TIM NATION : Sin : Observe and rejoice ! At last even this Age of Big Business has found a practical use for the intelligentsia . It seems , according to a striking advertisement put out through the papers by a Florida real-estate company , that the appoint  --  ment of Mr. Hamilton Holt to the presidency of Rollins College , Winter Park , is a cogent reason for immediately investing heavily in the Florida land said company has to sell , the presence of a noted man of brains being likely to boost values at once .

New Canaan , Conn. , October 23 GRACE ISABEL COLBRON " More Power to His Jaw " TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : For Colonel Mitchell let all good citizens wish more power to his jaw . He is doing excellent work in undermining discipline in the army and navy . As long as we must have these useless and pernicious institutions anything that weakens their morale should be welcomed . In that way their power to do harm will be lessened . Without desiring to accomplish such a result or dreaming of its possibility Colonel Mitchell is doing it just the same . May he never grow weary of well-doing . It is not to be desired that Mitchell 's agitation result in putting in control of the army and navy anyone more efficient than the present heads of these departments or the present Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy . Inefficiently con  --  ducted military institutions are less of a danger than efficiently conducted ones . Though the only good military force is a dis  --  banded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no respect for its superior officers . Between the present secre  --  taries of the army and navy and Colonel Mitchell , that is the kind of army and navy we are on the way to getting . For once the right men are in the right places . ? May all be kept there until their ' places can be abolished . Baltimore , November 18 SAMUEL DANZIGER Arkansawyers , Attention 1 To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Several years ago an older brother introduced me to The Nation . My reading was always done in deep seclusion , and followed , invariably , by reverential prayer . I had as soon a prohibition officer had caught me red-handed with a jar of home brew as for a missionary Baptist to have found me read  --  ing The Nation . Later the Infernal Thing began to wring $5 from my pocket annually . And now I infer from an advertise  --  ment on the back of The Nation for September 30 that forty-four others in Arkansas have succumbed to the same malady . I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infirmary should be endowed , with Dr. Mencken as its dean , or else the infidels should assemble under cover of night in some secluded mountain pass and organize a Nation Club for their own fiendish delight and for the dissemination of infi  --  delity among the elect .
