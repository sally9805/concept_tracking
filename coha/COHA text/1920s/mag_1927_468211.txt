occur to her that such home training was scarcely in line with a college course in chemistry , where success depends on self-reliant experiment . To what do these cases point ? Is it not probable that modern society has unduly prolonged the age of family protection ? Let us see what has happened . During the last century the early marriage , the independent young couple , the large family have almost disappeared . In college groups , at least , schooling is prolonged , marriage is postponed and is carried on inherited capital , loaned or given , and small families are the rule . The result must be a prolongation of the period of dependence , primarily economic but also intellectual . Meanwhile the school has gone ahead in the opposite direction . In place of the memorized recitation , pupils are trained in self-reliant thought . Improved efficiency in teaching has raised both quantity and quality of education . Increased access to knowledge has meant a wider grasp on situations . Thus , a group of more self-reliant persons are confronted , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation is aggravated when an attempt is made to fit in the codes of American social life with education . A week-end at home , as President Neilson has truly said , often means physical wreck for a student . She leaves a comparatively well-ordered and regular time-schedule , to exchange it for one of utter disorder and irregularity . She is plunged into a round of restless activity not all self-sought , by any means . I hope to escape a charge of malice when I say that any college that tried to live on the time-schedule of many American homes would be deserted in a week . For the failure to respect an appointment , for thoughtless violation of hours reserved responsible , in part at least . It is unfortunately true that college for women , as for men , is a social passport . Yet even their misuse of its purpose does not satisfy many socially ambitious families . In defiance of all good sense , families persist in " bringing out " their daughters in the old-fashioned way , in the midst of college studies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parents often actively connive at breaking academic rules to gain a merely social end , with inevitable results in the children 's attitude to social standards . Last year a mother removed her daughter from Vassar because , having failed in certain academic subjects , she had lost the privilege of several days of absence at a famous university prom . I am not contending that a diploma is more valuable than a dance ; but I deplore the waste of time and money spent in arriving at the evaluation , a waste the more painful to me since , in making r place for this student , two other worth3 applicants had been rejected . A young woman who had begun - tt make a name for herself as an excellen research worker returned to her home b devote herself to her mother , in the ab sense of other children from the home She was a quiet and essentially home loving person , and had willingly post poned professional advancement in grai itude for what the parents had given he She found , however , that her retur. meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intrigued into a con plex schedule in which the home had n place . At twenty-three she was to th family a debutante , a spoke in the whee She was asked to give up a useful , bus life for one of crowded leisure ? save tl mark ! It was too much to ask , and tl separation this time was permanent . Again and again when a tragedy coin PARENTS AND upon a family , it is the daughter whose college days are given up , to keep the family together , while the son keeps his own course . This is almost inevitable in the light of the crisis in the family relations . But it is strange for what trivial purposes the same sacrifice is often asked : for companionship on a cruise , for help in starting a new house , or to substitute for absentee parents as guardians of younger children . In all these cases is it not evident that the individual is subordinated to the group without sufficient cause ? III This disregard of the younger generation leads to serious consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of a student who had just completed plans to join the army of those who disappear ? an army of appalling size , happily seldom recruited from co This student , I found , had been ) romised that if she would give one year . o college she should have " a year in Europe , " then her crowning ambition .

" Oh , I do n't know : riday or Saturday , I guess ; some time the end of the week . We 'll just run ) wn to City Hall . " " Do the family know ? " " They 're off abroad somewhere . " This case is cited not for censure , but as illustrative of cause and effect . The unconventional ways of the young people of to-day result from a home life lacking in continuity . To maintain the home as a center of life-interests , consolidating and strengthening personal relations of all its members , may be too great a sacrifice to ask of present-day parents . I do not know . In many a home of the nineties , that period so generously decried , Sunday evening was set apart . The supper was the family 's own meal , prepared by children for parents . Lights were not struck after it , and for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared thought and hope together , banishing by common consent all reference to things and duties outside . It was a piecing together time of family ways in need of repair like the clothes in mother 's darning basket . What have our enlightened ones got to substitute for it , now that it is as obsolete as the Cotter 's Saturday night ? Parents will say that it is not their fault . But man 's lordship of the Sabbath was not proclaimed , surely , in order that it should be surrendered to the conference , the country club , or the motor trip . But the family broken up only by exigencies of time and occasion is fortunate in this age . The home divided by divorce is in this respect a little better than the home divided by hatred of parents for each other . There is a frankness in making public the breach of vows . But from the teacher 's point of view both are deplorable , and deplorably common . In my twenty years of teaching , cases involving breach of social and academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the divided home as to lead me to make this a primary inquiry in dealing with a student . Some time ago a student was on trial for acts involving expulsion until the father and mother appeared at the college . Then a student officer came to me and said , " She ought to be expelled , but I do n't see how we can sentence her to that home situation . " The notion that pretences can be maintained before children 's eyes , that the difference between wife and husband is purely private and personal can not be sustained in the light of the teacher 's experience . If facts are to be judged in the light of their consequences , the individualistic solution of marriage will not stand . A student was to be withdrawn from college . The mother stayed at one hotel , the father at another . One conferred with me at ten o'clock , the other at eleven . Their proposals were diametrically opposite . Yet they both imagined their situation to be unknown not only to the world , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for the college failure . These cases may all be referred , it seems to me , to a general misunderstanding as to the nature of the relations of a child to the home . Essentially , they bear witness to a theory that the child is somehow the property of the family , absorbed in it , and constantly subordinated either to its aims , or those of one or other parent . The child may be thought of as forever a child . " This is my baby , " the proud mother will introduce her glowering and embarrassed offspring of eighteen . There is no effort in these cases on the part of the parents to adjust themselves to a growing personality . The family relation is static ; and , as the law of life is the law of growth , the parental relation atrophies . Let us state the principle involved in positive form . Children from birth are individuals , growing , separate personalities , involved in every relation of the family , but yet independently at work upon their own sensations and reactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned , for their own sake and for their own ends . Children are not ends in themselves only ; we see in them ideals fulfilling and to be fulfilled , the race strengthened and cherished . Most of all , we see in the child the promise of theman or woman to come ; we shall recognize at maturity the companion , not the subordinate . We parents must put more of reason , if no less of affection , into our relations with children . The minister 's daughter who is n't quite honest ; the professor 's daughter who does not know how to study ; the physician 's daughter suffering from malnutrition ; the surgeon whose child was tongue-tied ? these are commonplaces on the campus . Just because one 's profession is outside the home , one fails to bring it to bear upon its members . And here I must cry " Peccavi , " for I am in receipt of a letter from my own eldest daughter , now at school , in which she says , " You see , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write than to talk . " Confession is good for the soul and the teacher has his touch of nature . IV The neglect which is due to ignoranc ? is no more common , however , than the over-estimation which results Cron egoistic exaggeration . Tamburlaine ' prophecy is the wish of every ambitiou man for his children : " My flesh , divided in your precious shapes , Shall still retain my spirit , though I die . " It is often impossible for father or motile to believe that the same spirit is not s retained . They forget how much r that will-power has been generated b the opposition of circumstances over come , a privilege they have theroselvE denied their children . Sometimes this parental projection ( personal ambition overtaxes a physic : frame . The persistent efforts of parent to send children to college who are phys tally unfit for the work have resulted a requirement of a physician 's certificaof fitness for admission , and in the fo mation of a committee on health , wit power to dismiss any student who fai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taken student had been kept at college by h ambitious father , in the face of her own opposition , and of her own obviously failing vitality . Life at the college may not have hastened her breakdown , but certainly happiness could not be found in realizing how great the handicap of physical weakness was . More frequently parents overestimate their children 's mental powers , even when they are unusual . The tests of intelligence , shown in alertness of response , now used as aids to admission by many colleges , are still resented by parents who refuse to accept classification of their offspring . A brilliant graduate refuses to believe that his daughter has not inherited his love of hooks and ability to master them . The child will be pushed on through a semester or two of failure , and when the dismissal comes there is an explosion of wrath against college standards . The results are lasting both in parental resentment and in emotional reactions in the young . A feeling of inferiority may have been permanently driven home by the experience . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance of a brilliant younger sister purely on account of such a view . Sometimes the over-prizing of one 's own is by the social standard . The dull child is a misfortune , the ugly duckling is a tragedy in the swan 's home . College fraternities are filled with unpopular sons of popular fathers , foisted on unwilling groups by alumnal influence . The tragedy is more individual in women 's colleges , where sororities are not so strong in social control . The same harm is done , however , whenever the ambitious mother tries to force her daughter into a mold for which temperament unfits her . This has occasionally a ludicrous side . A few months ago a college physician was asked to treat a student who had fainted after very light exercise . Inquiry showed that the girl had been reducing her weight unduly . Remonstrance brought out the tearful confession , " Mother says if I do n't reduceeighteen pounds by Easter I ca n't come back to college . " When the mother came to college , in response to the warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she replied that she as a girl had been famous for her slender form , that she had retained her youthful figure by every sacrifice , and that she could not bear a lump of a daughter plodding beside her through life . She preferred her child to risk anremia rather than the certainty of " too , too solid flesh . " The problem of the only child , to which reference has already been made , is pertinent here . Ambition is concentrated on the one ewe lamb , and if there is failure or disappointment , often of the slightest type , the love may turn to loathing . Parents nearly always fail to blame themselves for what has occurred . The lengths to which their disappointment will drive them are difficult of credence . A minister of my acquaintance , whose daughter was expelled from college , compelled her on her return home to rise in the congregation and confess her fault to the whole community . I know of instances of disinheritance merely for the holding of private opinions different from family tradition . Prejudice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send daughters to college . In my judgment no father should send his daughter to college who is not willing to face a prospect of her entrance into legal or medical practice . Teaching , nursing , and other professions more or less pre-empted by women are seldom objected to , but law and politics are stumbling blocks that have caused more than a few estrangements . Akin to the " only child " obsession is the sacrifice of the first-born . It often seems as though parents had exhausted their disciplinary powers upon the eldest child , letting the others bring themselves up . The result is an eldest child , self-depreciating , timid , and silent , quite certain that an independent judgment is sure to be wrong . Such students are much more difficult to develop than is the " spoiled youngest " to divert into useful activity . The effects of such maladjustments in the family are the closing of free access to inner thought and feeling and Lite development of an emotional strain often beyond the power of young people to control . I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most perfect code of courtesy one felt the clash of steel . In one case a young woman jumped up arid rushed from the room , unwilling to concede the loss in self-control which contact with her mother nearly always produced . V Such cases verge upon the psycho-neurotic , and it is not the intention of the writer to trespass on this field , about which too much has already been written by amateurs . The psychiatrist alone can be trusted here . He is already well aware that parental repression is a most frequent violation of mental hygiene . The nursery school with its resultant training classes for parents is a direct outcome of psychiatry . But the need for such training of parents does not cease with the infancy of children . It may be true , as we are so often told , that a child 's character is formed , for good or ill , by five years of age ; but there is something to be done at eighteen and twenty-one , if this deponent may be credited . The writer looks forward , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most popular course in men 's and women 's colleges alike ; and when the elements of social ethics shall be grounded , as they should be , on the strong basis of physiology and psychology . Shakespeare with all his myth and tradition has taught us sounder social history in " King Lear " than any Cambridge encyclopaedia of fact . Wars result from wrong relations between individuals . One curious result of late marriage is that parents put more than an average generation between themselves and their children . In these days of shifting codes , speech , and behavior this leads to the attitude , " What are we coming to ? " An embarrassment results from this disparity of ages . Often , in surrender to this gap between the groups , parents give up any attempt to control social life . Yet it ought not to be difficult to keep thehomeabreast even of these times . The home has every advantage but novelty over any rival ; and that it can supply . " Family " stands to young people today for name , position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anonymity , group standing , adaptation . The American nickname is a reversion to barbarism , so far as family is concerned . Parents may follow the fashion and clap family names on their girls ; the crowd will give Beauchamp the accolade of " Bugs . " The shyness of young people is what leads them to prefer anonymity to family name and standing . If " family " could somehow connote more individual quality and less obligation to a name , its problems would be solved . Most unwilling of all readjustments that parents must learn to make is the recognition of the atypical . I have seen again and again the attribution of moral delinquency to a mere physical variation . The tomboy and the softy meet scant favor from womanly mother and manly father . Such instances create bitterness sharper than the serpent 's tooth of ingratitude . The effect is , usually , to intensify the abnormal element . No appeal is made so often to teachers as this , to correct what is frequently physiological at base and , therefore , not readily subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group was more numerous , especially in women 's colleges ; and early caricatures affected the mannish mode . That has gone now . The college woman is as near the norm of the American womanhood of similar economic , social , and racial condition as can he imagined , given some selection on the basis of mentality . The college man , thanks to competitive athletics , has overstressed the masculine attributes , and concealed the fact that within his group are many less virile types . These , as Wyndham Lewis and Andr ? Gide point out , are more numerous than is suspected , probably more so in Europe than in America . Even in stereotyped America , however , the atypical in sensitiveness is not rare . It would be better for parents to ignore such problems altogether than to approach them merely from the moral side , as is so often the case . Science is only beginning to reveal personality , but already we are sure that emotions impel from sources deeper down than any current code . To learn with one 's children the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacities , tendencies which one has , seems to me the primary law of parenthood . A father came once to protest against his daughter 's dismissal for failure in study . " You do n't know her as I do , " he said , in the language of salesmanship . " Let me sell her to you . " And he tried , and tried well . But his daughter knew herself better than he did . " The teachers tell me I 've taken it like a sport , " she told him . " Now be a sport , and help me . " The father obeyed the daughter 's plea ; the two tackled together the task of restudying her powers ; and to-day this young student is triumphantly carrying by sheer grit one of the most difficult professional : nurses in the country . An unpromising mental equipment had been fully capitalized by a re-appraisal of all the ' acts . On the other hand , parents frequently now helpful facts quite hidden from -. : ollege authority . No lesson of school is nore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be omnis ! ient . They are criticized for not acting in facts which sometimes are known ally to parents . If fathers and mothers vere more frank with their ounce of pre-ention , the pounds of cure would someimes be less costly . Yet , for a ' that an ' a ' that , the family an institution of extraordinary vitality . It has survived migrations , frontier conditions , industrial conditions , city life , poverty and prosperity , tyranny and freedom , communism and slavery . It will survive its present problems if only its heads recognize the need of adaptation to the new conditions . This can be accomplished only when father and mother have heartily lived over again with their children the life of the new generation . And this is a hard thing to do when life , one 's own life , is so very interesting and absorbing . We live at a high nervous tension , we America n j our hearts and nerves are not what they should be . We need the family as a haven of rest and emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation . Old and young need to maintain common thought and action , to talk the same language , to love with equal intensity the experience of beauty and of knowledge , to know one another . Older folks need to stay young , to play more and better , to enjoy more simply and intensely , to retain , in a word , the ways of youth . Young folks need to reflect , to analyze , to form strong purposes , and to prosecute them steadily . Any form of education that perpetuates or increases the present lines of cleavage in society must be modified to permit of retaining these ideals . The family must be taken into the school system . I would pay tribute here to the hundreds of parents I have known who have recognized these principles and have illustrated them in their living . They neither minimize nor magnify their children 's qualities . They think successful children more important than a successful business , and they do not expect such success to be mere imitation of themselves . They learn life with and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal sons and daughters I have learned the vital part that father and mother must play in building the self-reliant , self-controlled , creative personality in son and daughter which is the aim of all education .
