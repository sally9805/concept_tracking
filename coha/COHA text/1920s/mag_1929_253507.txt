The Lash of the Czar ( Amkino ) . Propaganda , regardless of whether it is issued in a just cause or a stupid one , is always disagreeable . It is especially disagreeable when dished out to the public with an indigestible sugar-coating of Art . But although propaganda has spoiled for the U. S. public many pictures which , wildly praised by some critics for their scenic effects , were merely soap-box communism , propaganda does not spoil this story of a governor with a conscience . <P> He had ordered his soldiers to fire into a crowd of workers - that was what the Governor ( I. V. Kochalov ) did not like to remember . The growth of his fear , of the indignation of the people , and the hatred toward him developing for personal reasons in the minds of a governess and a scab , were originally thought out by Leonid Andreyev , Russia 's great , mad dramatist and story writer . Director A. Protozanov seems to feel with Andreyev that psychology is , in the long run , more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aide-de-camp taking a dose of salts ; a statue that loses its nose . <P> Actor I. V. Kochalov 's real name is Shverubovitch . He has been with the Moscow Art Theatre since 1900 , and toured the U. S. a few years ago in The Lower Depths , Three Sisters , The Brothers Karamazov and An Enemy of the People . Russians think his greatest part is the name role in Hamlet . The Soviet Government bestowed on him the cherished title " People 's Artist of the Republic . " Actor Kochalov adds to his large income by giving recitals in Moscow . His wife , Madame Litovtseva , is an actress and producer of the Moscow Art Company . Their son , Vadim , has been in the U. S. this season with Balieff 's Chauve Souris . Actor Kochalov speaks no English , eats piles of pirojek* and drinks vodka freely without any sacrifice of his robust , Slavic dignity . <P> True Heaven ( Fox ) . Generals signing armistices should work fast , should scribble their names as fast as they can , because-what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of leveled rifles ? The news has to get there in time . Suppose you are an English officer , and you fall in love with a beautiful girl , but when you are made a spy and sent to Germany you find she is a spy too , but on the other side , and she has to choose between you and her flag , and chooses her flag , as you want her to deep down in your heart , and then you 're sentenced and she relents , but she ca n't change the sentence , and you are standing in front of those rifles-well , you want the news to get there in time . Silliest shot is Lois Moran cauterizing a cut in George O'Brien 's chest . <P> The Flying Fleet ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) . A lieutenant-commander ( retired ) in the U. S. Navy , one Frank Wead , wrote this script showing how naval aviators are made-Annapolis , then round-the-world cruise , then training school at Pensacola . Anita Page falls from an aquaplane into the plot . This air-photography is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which one pilot dives at another on the field and afterwards rescues him when his plane falls into the Pacific , is about as true to life as a recruiting poster . The sallow aviator is Ramon Novarro.
