txt What people most want to know now about the East Coast Railway is why it is n't up-to-date and able to meet all the demands upon it . The public knows little of the difficulties behind the scene in meeting transportation demands . Railroad people have little time for public explanation . ? REORG A N un ANIL:MOWN RAILROAD SYSTEM The main freight transportation business of the United States has been reorganized the past two years , and the public knows practically nothing of it , although this reorganization has vitally affected every part of the country , every man and every investment , as well as prices for goods and the rate for money . And all this can be expounded right from Florida . I studied this railroad situation in Southern California last year ; saw the effect it would have upon the railroads , the equipment stocks , and the business and prosperity of the country in 1925 , uut illness and a European trip intervening was unable to set it forth as I thought it ought o be set forth . TILE UN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by men not in the public eye . " The soldiers fight and the kings are heroes . " It is knov. - nLin a general way , that there is an American Railway Association formed by the executives of our transportation system , but very little else is known about it . It has a car service division under which the country is divided into twelve districts . In these districts advisory boards have been organized with representatives from the chambers of commerce , boardsof trade , all the shipping and trade organizations , and the public .  - -  JUSTICE IY TRANSPORTATION Trade demand for future frEight equipment can be always known and tabulated , and the legitimate need of every freight user is recorded under such a broad organization . In case of shortage of equipment , the advisory board , associated with and representing all interests , is able promptly and equitably to allot cars to every individual shipper . Without such supervision the tendency is for every shipper to double his dcknand upon the railroad and to hold his cars as long as he can . Indeed , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the beneficiary , as just preceding 1907. is the car equipment manufacturer . INJUSTICE IN BUSINESS But the business interests of the whole country are damaged . Freight is congested , embargoes are placed , goods are tied up in freight cars , warehouses and factories , and merchants over-order , hoping to get a fraction of what they demand . And , as in 1920 , order in the business world is restored only by the automatic rise in the money rate , checking business and production , closing factori9s and throwing labor out of employment . Tracks , warehouses and factories are then cleared , and labor empties its pocketbook . The bank receives back its money , and again invites the resumption of business by low money rates . AVTIAT MIGHT RAVE flans : Two years ago there would have been a riot for cars in the Northwest to enable the shippers to take advantage of $2 wheat , but for the Advisory Board of the Car Service division .

Any speculative demand for equipment is quickly spotted and quickly checked . Complaints of farmers and shippers of injustice or lack of equipment have absolutely ceased . TUTTING FLORIDA . IN onnnn . Florida has just recently been organized as a division of the Southeast Advisory Board , which is one of the now twelve Advisory Boards governing the distribution of railroad equipment . New England was organized last year . completing the twelve . Donald D. Conn of Washington was the organizer and is the efficient head of theseCnr Service Division of the . t.terican Railway Associr tion . When the railroad embargo was laid on Florida , he sent 19 car service agents tr the East Coast Railway and came himself in the month of January . In the second week of February he was able to assure me that the Coast Line would soon be cleared up for an easier freight movement . SOME RAILROAD COMPARISONS Let one consider some of the difficulties encountered . The Florida East Coast has been struggling for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the same time double-track its line to Miami . This looks easy to one who reads the railroad history of the United States and sees Thomas Nickerson ploughing the great Atchison , Topeka es Santa Fe through the Southwest and building in Colorado , California and Mexico , as well as several other states and territories . all at the same time ; or witnesses Shields building for James J. Hill in the Northwest a mile a day as a regular schedule . But they had the prairie before them and their labor well in hand . The Florida East Coast burns oil and can not use the coal-locomotives of other sections of the country . They have recently borrowed oil-burning locomotives from the Southwest and California , and are now being straightened out in power equipment . What was done to beat the embargo and really aczentuated it may be illustrated by the case of a " smart aleck " who shipped in a carload of lumber to Kee : West to get around the embargo and had it come over the Florida East Coast to Miami . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 ' " e of the ' 700-car terminal yard room . This was really " boot-leg " lumber that was to be held on the track and sold therefrom . But when discovered the Car Service Division men took hold of the matter and this fellow 's lumber was taken to Hialeah and dumped . Under the tariff lumber can be shipped in. but it can be thrown of the track after 72 hours ' notice under Section 4 of the bill of lading , as approved by the Commerce Commission . It may thus be seen that the Car Service Division under Donald D. Conn is today probably the most effective business organitation of universal service in the'linited States . Through the Advisory Board it allots the equipment , and when necessary can order any railroad to empty cars used for storage . NVI/V MONEY IS FAST AND SI ERCII A N TS PROSPER It is this well organized Car Service Division of the American Railway Association , operating through twelve regional advisory boards , that has arrested not only car congestion but all business congestion in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouses . It has enabled the factories to ship with regularity and the merchants to receive with such regularity that no large stocks of goods are now carried as formerly by Merchants and distributors . They can order at will and be sure of prompt receipt of goods . This has regulated and reduced the price of merchandise , unlocked stores of money , created our 70 and 80% bank reserves and enables ' the United States to be of financial assistance to the whole world . MAKING SURPLUS CARS The only sufferers have been the makers of car equipment , for where the country had formerly , in prosperous times , a deficiency in equipment , there has never been since organization of this Car Service Division less than 100,000 surplus freight cars in the United States , and of late there has been a surplus of 250,000 cars ready to meet the sudden demand or the growing needs of the country . If such advisory regulation could be applied to all business , there would be an enormous saving to the whole country .

In two days : Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . Shen continued to howl against the railroad because ' they could not get their shipments promptly through . , But the world was not built in a day . Progress in business organization and the mutuality of service is the work not of days but of years and generations . HUMAN PROGRESS Henry Ford would like to see every farmer in the United States with-a Ford tractor , a Ford truck , and one or two Ford motor cars for t ? e family . He would like to harness all the water power in the country and he would like to raise everybody 's wages . Like so many others , ' he does not stop to think that something must be left . for the yet unborn and that human progress is more important than prosperity . The trouble with Florida today , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred-million-dollar land developrAent propositions , is the failure to recognize the forces of conservation and of real progress .
