A main trade portal between the U. S. and Mexico is Laredo , " Tex . Last week the portal was slammed shut by the removal of the Mexican consulate . Reason : Laredo 's District Attorney John A. Vails had attempted to arrest General Plutarco Elias Calles , onetime President of Mexico , on a 1922 murder conspiracy charge . Laredo shopkeepers , hard hit by the loss of Mexican trade , appealed to Governor Dan Moody who , in turn , appealed to Secretary of State Henry Lewis Stimson . <P> Statesman Stimson was patently annoyed that Governor Moody had allowed Texas to drift into such an international tangle . Already bothered by a bad head cold , he sent the Texas executive a message , promising " to see what , if anything , may be wisely done " and observing further : " The Mexican reason for the consulate closing is . . . because they feel that Laredo is not a safe port for their public citizens to pass through . . . . Mexicans find it difficult to understand that you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct of legal officers of that country . . . . If any effort can be taken along that line , I wish you would advise me . " <P> In diplomatic language Statesman Stimson was suggesting that Governor Moody remove District Attorney Vails from Office as the price for Mexico 's reopening the Laredo portal .
