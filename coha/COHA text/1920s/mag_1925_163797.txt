The items on the Congressional program are numerous , and as in former sessions , it is likely that some of them will be passed without action . The major item ; <P> Tax Reduction will be enacted in some form . The House has before it the $325,000,000 tax reduction bill drafted by the Ways and Means Committee . Doubtless there will be many amendments to it before final passage . With good fortune a tax reduction bill should be a law by March . <P> World Court . In this last session the Senate agreed to take up the World Court a few days after convening this winter . The Administration is evidently planning a final attempt to secure U. S. adherence to the World Court at this session , with the chances slightly in its favor . <P> Appropriations . The regular supply bills for the several departments of the Government must be passed and as usual there is to be discussion of appropriations for aviation . There will also be some argument over a public buildings bill- an item which has been lacking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate will have to consider the debt funding agreements recently made . It is expected to approve them , but there is certain to be criticism of those cases in which large concessions have been made to the debtors- the cases of Italy and Belgium . <P> Agriculture . The agricultural situation is once more destined to be " improved " by legislation . An effort will be made to pass a modified price fixing bill - with Administration opposition . Co-operative marketing aid will have the Administration 's support . <P> Coal . Means of dealing with coal strikes will call for attention if not action , especially if the anthracite strike continues through the winter . <P> Railroads . The question of forced and voluntary consolidation for railways will be dealt with , as well as the question of abolishing the Railroad Labor Board . <P> Shipping . Congress will be called upon to settle the fight between the Administration and the Shipping Board , in which the Administration wishes to separate the Board from control of the merchant fleet , making the President of the Emergency Fleet Corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Property . Shall the enemy property taken over by the Alien Property Custodian during the War be returned to its original owners ? Or used to satisfy claims of U. S. citizens against Germany ? <P> Federal Subsidies to States will probably draw considerable fire in Congress , with the West , which receives most of the subsidies ( for road building , etc. ) , lined up against the East , which pays most of the subsidies . <P> Reclamation . Western senators are eager to get more irrigation projects under way . The Administration is holding : back , and the grievances will be aired in Congress . <P> Air Policy . The Mitchell charges will have a vigorous echo in Con- congress . The Administration will probably stand by the Morrow report , but how many Republicans it can hold in line is matter of doubt . <P> Muscle Shoals . This endless theme on which Congressmen have argued remains yet to be disposed of . A commission which the President appointed to consider it disagreed , leaving the question in air . <P> Reorganization of the executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from previous years . Something should be done about it soon .
