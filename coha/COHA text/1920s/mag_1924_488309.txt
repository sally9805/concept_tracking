-1 A FOLLETTE was right . There is a slush fund . The Republicans have admitted virtually every one of the Senator 's charges about the attempt to buy the election . National Treasurer William V. Hodges admits that Pennsylvania 's quota for this year 's Republican campaign fund is $600,000 , and adds that Illinois 's is $400,000 . The campaign manager , William M. Butler , admits that the total will be at least $3,000,000 ; but with the Pennsylvania and Illinois figures in mind it is difficult to take that figure seriously . It used to be reckoned that three-fourths of the campaign funds came out of New York City . The Republican National Committee admits raising and spending $1,714,317 before October 10 ? and every one knows that the vast bulk of campaign expenditures , including the expensive full-page newspaper advertisements , come in the last month of the campaign . Upon the admitted basis of the early stages , this expensive campaign may easily cost the Republicans as much as the great outpouring of 1920 , when Will Hays distributed more than $8,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those anonymous statements which everyone knows to be reports of . the President 's conferences with the Washington newspapermen we are told , after three days ' sittings by Senator Borah 's committee , that " a representative of the President " says that " the President is especially pleased with the showing that the finances of the committee have been handled with such care and regard for the law and the proprieties . " This is in keeping with the tactics of the Republican campaign . From the beginning Mr. Coolidge has pursued a policy of intrepid silence about every disclosure of crookedness and rottenness in his party and in his Cabinet . Now among the campaign letters soliciting funds to reelect Mr. Coolidge was a famous letter sent out by the Massachusetts Republican Campaign Committee . There is " no limit to the amount an individual may give to the committee , " this bare-faced letter said . " Large contributions will be so divided as to give full observance to the requirements of the statute ' which limits contributions from any one person . " Could crookedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party in his home State to buy the national election be bolder ? Yet the President is " especially pleased " with the " care and regard for the law and the proprieties " ! Or again , there is the letter of George S. Ward , president of the Ward Baking Co. , popularly known as the " Bread Trust . " Mr. Ward in New York State , like Mr. Grundy in Pennsylvania , set out to raise money to buy Coolidge enthusiasm in the insurgent West . He sent a circular letter to the bakers and heads of allied industries in New York State . In this letter , with a cynicism worthy of the Massachusetts Republicans , he warned his friends that the law forbade contributions from corporations , and asked them to make their remittances on personal checks . But in order to identify the corporation he enclosed a separate blank , to be attached to the check , so that the Republican National Committee might know to whom to be grateful . Nor was Mr. Ward alone . Mr. G. Bluthenthal , " chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican National Committee wrote a similar letter to the members of his industry . Probably every industrywas canvassed . " Corporations can not contribute to campaign funds under the law , " wrote Mr. Bluthenthal , " but I earnestly urge you and your associates to contribute liberally , using the enclosed blank to identify your check . " Was that what Mr. Coolidge meant by " regard for the law and the proprieties " ? It is the old game of " frying the fat " out of the protected industries . Mr. Grundy , the president of the Pennsylvania Manufacturers ' Association , put it plainly in his letters . " Pennsylvanians ! " he cried , " Because you have enjoyed much you must contribute liberally . " Enjoyed what ? Why , special privileges , tariff favors  --  from the Republican Party , of course . And if big business wants more favors it must " come across . " It is the old , old story . If there is anything calculated to undermine faith in American institutions , to deepen the sense of class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against which the Coolidge orators fulminate , it is precisely this Republican plan to buy with money what they could not win by argument . It is a battle of rich against poor . Already , the Republicans admit , more than two hundred individuals have contributed to the party chest more than $1,000 each . William Wrigley , the chewing-gum man , gave $25,000 ; Mortimer Schiff , of Kuhn , Loeb and Co. , gave $15,000 ; two members of the firm of J. P. Morgan and Co. gave $5,000 each ; A. R. Carleton , president of the Holly Sugar Corporation , owning beet-sugar factories in three States ( for which the Republican National Treasurer serves as counsel ) , gave $10,000 . And so it goes . Last April , when the country was aroused at the revelations that Doheny and Sinclair had contributed liberally to both old-party campaign funds , Mr. Coolidge let it be known that he was opposed to contributions of more than $5,000 each . Today his party treasurer reports a score above that limit  --  and Mr. Coolidge is " especially pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large contributions  --  twenty of $5,000 or more  --  although their total is far below that of the affluent Republicans . Contrast these figures with the poverty of the Progressives . They have collected a total of $190,525 ? a little more than a tenth as much as the Republicans  --  and have not yet spent all of it . More than 72,000 individuals contributed ; most of the money came in one-dollar contributions . The largest donation was from the national treasurer , W. T. Rawleigh ; only one other gift was above $1,000 ; and only three were of that size . There is a people 's movement for you ! " There is in this - country a great unrest , " says John W. Davis . " There is stirring , in the public mind of the United States a great protest , uninformed in part and unintelligent in part , yet which , like all such things , may mount and grow until " it becomes an onrushing storm , uncontrolled and uncontrollable , carrying us on its bosom to ports we can not know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old days of unchecked graft , if it believes that with the free use of money it can buy up States which would be lost to it at an honest election , let it beware . The people of the United States will not stay bought . Sooner or later , by one means or another , the people will throw off their money masters . Senator Borah , still a Republican , said last spring : .. . So long as political parties seeking power or control of the Government accept vast contributions from those who are interested in matters of legislation or administration you will have sinister and corrupt and controlled government . . . . It all leads to that sinister and subtle influence which does more to break down representative government than any specific instance of open bribe . There you have it ! If there is ever a real danger of revolution in this country the Republican vote buyers will be responsible for it . Unto the Least of These . . . z IANG SUN WAN was just a poor " Chink , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderer of three men found dead in the Chinese Educational Mission in Washington , back in 1919 . He denied it . Through days and nights the police stood guard over him in his hotel room , hurling questions , demands , affirmations at him . On the eighth day he was taken back to the mission and there examined and cross-examined for ten continuous hours . On the ninth day , at 5:20 in the morning , he was taken to the police-station and formally placed under arrest . There the gruelling continued . On the tenth day he was again taken to the mission , where an imaginary murder was enacted before his eyes . Finally , on the eleventh day , Wan confessed , and on the strength of that confession , which he later retracted , Ziang Sung Wan was convicted of murder . In a decision which ought to strike at the roots of police terrorism the United States Supreme Court has just granted Ziang Sung Wan a new trial , on the ground that the alleged confession was extorted . " The undisputed facts showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rendering the opinion of the court . " As to that matter there was no issue upon which the jury could properly have been required or been permitted to pass . The alleged oral statement and the written confession should have been excluded . " A confession tortured out of a man is no confession in the eyes of the law , and the Supreme Court refuses to recognize it as such . We think of the days of the rack and pinion as long past , yet every day of the year , in almost every city of the country , the police apply , in greater or less measure , third-degree methods to force suspects to confess . Once in a great while something happens to concentrate public attention upon this survival of medievalism . Then dead apathy follows ; the public forgets . Two years ago there was the case of Luther Boddy . Soddy was a young Negro , a rather shiftless young man who had fallen into the toils of what we euphemistically call the law . Once marked out by the police he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again he was taken to the station-house and " put on the grill . " He had fallen into that luckless group of misfits who no longer have any rights that policemen feel bound to respect , for whom the ordinary police restraints no longer exist . One day when two detectives seized him by the arm and told him to " come along " Boddy pulled out his gun and shot them both dead. - " I was so tired of being beaten up all the time , " he explained . Police Commissioner Enright stoutly denied the existence of third-degree methods at that time . The police officials always deny it . They denied it in Washington . But on the day on which Mr. Enright made his denial a prisoner appeared in court " a mass of black and blue bruises from his neck to his heels , " obviously " terribly beaten , " in the words of the police magistrate before whom he came for judgment . In that case the magistrate denounced the policeman responsible as not only a brute but a liar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The policeman , we do not doubt , is still on duty . A Filipino was beaten up last July ; " I 'm a dark man and poor , so there 's no hope for me , " he told the priest who attended him ; and he was right . Chicago had its moment of awakening in the early days of the Franks murder case . The Chicago police , before they discovered Leopold and Loeb , suspected two young instructors at the Lincoln School , and when the two instructors pleaded innocence they put them through what is known in the Chicago vernacular as ! ' goldfishing . " " Goldfishing , " apparently , includes beating with a rubber hose . The instructors will not soon forget what they learned of the treatment meted out to the underworld . The Chicago papers rang for a few days with denunciations of the beatings ; then all but the two instructors forgot . It is time that something was done to make police officials remember that they too are required to obey the law . Doubtless it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extorted by the third degree ; doubtless the inquisitors of the middle ages , too , could point to some honest successes of their methods . But the defense is no justification . It does not excuse the starving and torturing , bullying and beating which go on defiantly in the name of the law . Officials who are guilty of such practices , however sincerely they may believe them necessary , in fact violate their oaths of office . It would be a healthy shock to law officials all over the country if a few such guardians of the law were themselves thrown into prison , and made to suffer the penalties which would ' befall ordinary citizens who beat their neighbors with strips of rubber . hose . The decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Ziang Sung Wan should give the sanction of the federal government to a movement to restore respect for law among the law enforcers . The fact that Wan was just a poor " Chink " should make his case all the more impressive . Gottlieb and Seiff HAT 'S all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean that injunctions are a real issue in the campaign ? " There is a widespread effort to make it appear that the power of injunction is an unimportant matter . The best answer to this sort of propaganda is the plain story of one injunction . Gottlieb and Seiff are partners in manufacturing children 's coats . They are contractors for a larger firm in New York City and maintain their own business in Jamaica , Long Island . Thus they escape union regulations and union wages . They employ between sixty and one hundred workers , mostly Polish and Italian girls ( they give the lower figure of the number of their employees ; the union gives the higher ) , and they pay a wage scale substantially less than that which is paid in New York . The union alleges it is less than half the New York union wage . The existence of such shops as this menaces union conditions everywhere . It was natural , therefore , that the International Ladies ' Garment Workers ' Union should take an interest in conditions . Dissatisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate increase in wages , a reduction of hours , and recognition of the union . The employers refused , and late in July a strike began . As to the number of those who struck and the extent of dissatisfaction there is the usual difference in the statements of the employers and of the union . At any rate , the employers rushed to court to get a temporary injunction against the union . This they promptly got from Justice Cropsey on August 6 , 1924 . ( Remember the date ) . It was a sweeping injunction , covering even peaceful picketing . It was based . only on the employers ' statement of the case . The temporary injunction and order " to show cause " finally came to a hearing before Justice John MacCrate . Both the employers and the union submitted affidavits and arguments by counsel . Justice MacCrate took his time ; finally on September 3 , he refused to grant an injunction . His opinion of the mass of affidavits before him and the strength of the employers ' case is thus laconically summarized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One actual assault is specified . It is uncontradicted that the complainant was held equally guilty with those against whom he complained . The affidavits of the police officers can not be disregarded , especially when it is noted that none of those who claim to have been threatened swear they have made complaint to the police . The employers promptly appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court , where the matter remains still undecided . Meanwhile , it might be supposed that the employees were free to go ahead with the peaceful conduct of the strike . Not at all . When Justice MacCrate had decided against them the employers went before Justice Young of the . Appellate Division . As one of their counsel they retained a brother of Justie Rich , who sits on the Appellate bench with Justice Young . Justice Young , sitting by himself , without any hearing , reissued the temporary injunction on which Justice MacCrate had decided adversely ! Some days later he held a brief hearing and continued the injunction , though no facts were brought out which had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , from August 6 on the union has been enjoined from the effective conduct of the strike , in spite of the fact that the one judge who heard their case decided in their favor . When the Appellate Division finally reaches a decision on the merits of the original case , it is likely that there will be no real strike in existence . The Italian and Polish girl workers have neither the financial reserves nor the experience of union solidarity to carry on for months when the courts ally themselves with their employers ; meanwhile their competition makes it harder for other girls to earn a decent living . For this state of affairs courts established to do justice are directly responsible . The employees were restrained from perfectly legal acts without a reasonable hearing . One judge coolly nullified the decision of another . If no pickets were sent to jail without trial by jury that is only because the union obeyed the injunction . It is not because the injunction itself was just , nor is it certain that every union will always obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the aid of employers in labor disputes is a dangerous barrier across the path to peaceful progress . In protesting against injunctions , the progressive movement and the labor unions behind it are standing not only for freedom but for a chance to win freedom without violence . Heaven and Hell T HERE is nothing surprising in President Eliot 's recently expressed opinion that he could not look forward with great pleasure to an eternity passed in any of the heavens imagined by popular theology . The remark is the sincere expression of a man who is drawing to the close of a long and active life and can not imagine himself as content in even the most blessed idleness ever conceived . His is the natural reaction of the worker , and it is doubtful if anyone ever really longed for eternal rest unless he had been one of those temperamentally incapable of doing anything likely to make him need even a shorter repose . The crudest imagination can picture a hell terrible enough to satisfy anyone 's idea of a place unpleasant as an eternal residence . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is not surprising that they should come to a point where they refuse to take seriously pictures of eternal bliss which , even when conceived by the most poetic minds , have always been singularly vapid , suggestive of a condition calculated to bore to extinction the most indolent man within the space of a very small fraction of eternity . The popular preachers , however , having on the whole an extremely low opinion of human character , give up reluctantly the threat of damnation ; and , since most of them seem sincerely to believe that vice is attractive and virtue dull , they will be ready to abandon the world as inevitably lost if they can neither threaten nor bribe the - ordinary man into being good . They have generally been more loath than laymen to admit that virtue is its own reward ; but it really looks as though , for the future , the world would have to get along as best it may with men who , like President Eliot , are willing to work and work well  --  not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply because they find in work itself the only incentive they need . Before we regret too much the good old days when heaven was heaven indeed and hell was boiling hot , it would be well to consider what was really believed . Our grandfathers may have been content with celestial harpers and heavenly choirs , but they themselves were , after all , degenerates from the primitive faith . In the days which were really good and really old imaginations were more vigorous and piety less emasculated by an unrighteous tenderness for sinners . If we wish to turn back , let us turn back to Tertullian , who pictured hell as a sort of peep show for the saved , guaranteed to furnish unfailing entertainment to the fortunate inhabitants of paradise , which  --  but his own vigorous style in the treatise " De Spectaculis " will give a more vivid picture : How shall I wonder ! How shall I laugh ! How shall I rejoice ! How shall I triumph when I behold so many and such illustrious kings groaning with Jupiter their god in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth in their own misfortune more piteous cries than those with which they had made the theater to resound , while the comedian 's powers shall be better seen as he becomes more flexible by the heat : Compared with such spectacles , with such subjects of triumph as ? these , what can praetor or consul , quaestor or pontiff , afford ? And even now faith can bring them near , imagination can depict them as present . To Tertullian eternity did not seem too long a time in which to make up for the kindness and forbearance demanded of him on earth .
