txt An exceptionally authoritative committee upon behalf of the Chamber of Commerce reports that " any attempt " to revive the War Finance Corpora " tion , and to instruct it to resume " its operations in a comprehensive " manner * f. would , in our judg " ment , prove ' ineffective and un " wise , " A similar opinion has been expressed on behalf of the business Men of Philadelphia , Moreover , there has been a notable lack of support of the corporation 's resurrection in circles whose opinions carry weight for competence and disinterestedness , The report of the New York Chambee carries weight because supported by the fullest and most convincing summary of the situation in its broadest aspects . The weakness of the argument for the revival of the corporation was that it thought too much of the farmers and too little of the other parties to the export trade , either foreign buyers or domestic sellers . As an afterthought , it has been ..  --  urged that the corporation would lend aid to others than farmers . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation as a whole and to relieve it in its entirety . It is undesirable , even obnoxious , that any particular trade , or all trade , should be swollen by any multiples of millions at the expense of rkreakening pressure for the betterment of the world 's welfare in all its Inspects and relations . It is more than a question of trade or of corporate Credit . It is a question of political and economic peace , of balancing twentytwo national budgets averaging deficits of more than a billion dollars each , of fitting Germany 's penalty to Its crime , of stopping expeditures - of eight billions or more annually for armaments , and in general of making it possible for all peoples to apply their resources to their necessities . It Is putting the cart before the horse to think of trade first , or alone , in Whatever proportions or manner promoted , against whatever obstacles . The better way is to remove the obstacles and allow trade to promote itself in freedom . To put the point bluntly , foreign trade has been overfinanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government credit . Our unofficial representative at the Brussels conference was right in saying that , under existing conditions , Europe is not a good risk . It ought to be made a good risk before it receives further credit which may be taken as encouragement in policies and conduct not deserving our approval . It is not for borrowers and buyers to set terms for lenders and sellers . The debtor world must qualify itself for credits before receiving them , either as matter of business or of charity . We alone have advanced some three to four bils. lions of private credit since Government credits were stopped , and foreign credit is frozen , " as domestic credit was , only to be released by liquidation , which is generally confused with deflation , now only moderately undertaken here or elsewhere . ; The Chamber thinks that the frozen foreign loans should be left between the banks and their customers and should not be taken over by the War Finance Corporation , If it Is to give relief , it should confine itself to future business , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets or make credit so plenty as to raise prices to consumers anywhere . " Holding " operation , or valorization , is had enough with private credit . ' With Government credit it has invariably led to disaster . The use of Federal tax money in any manner resembling that in North Dakota is not to be considered . The conclusion of the Chamber 's Committee is that the settling of the German incletnnity is the first step toward giving the ? - 'end confidence in Ettrope 's political AA social peace and economic reconstruction . Otherwise , " what 18 there to warrant our ex " pectation that an artificial increase " ' of credits granted to foreign coun " tries would do more than postpone " the coming of days even mere dis " astrous and empty of hOpe for these " debtor countries ? " There 14 an opportunity for the War Finance Corporation to be v. : ! eful , but not in competing With Edge law corporations , or numerous other combinations of farmers and others to promote their own trade , on their own resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadlock should ? be but the method is rather restriction of credit than excess of it :
