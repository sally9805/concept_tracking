CAPTAIN COOK , being an observer ; and explorer rather than a mere trader , appeals especially to ' the more phifosophical reader , who loves to see human nature in new situations . ' There was never a newer situation in the history of human nature than when the inhabitants of this continent , still lining in the Stone Age , suddenly discovered that there was such a sub ' stance as iron in the world . To the mind of an Indian , there could be nothing approaching it in importance except his first learning that there was , tich an animal as the horse . When we consider that , till well along in the last century , the Indians of the upper Missouri got their horses by stealing them from the tribes farther south , who stole them from the Comanches , who , in turn , stole them from the Mexicans , we gain some idea of the ability of the Indian to cover the length and breadth of this continent by way of theft or barter . The Indian never raised horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal them . But he would trade anything Its had for a piece of iron . Thus iron , and the news of iron , spread as if it also had wings . Nothing ever advertised itself better , or showed such ability to run on ahead . Indians who had never seen a white man had learned about it ; and a specimen here and there had created a demand for more . It tools no traveling man to go forth and introduce iron to the Stone Age . Wisconsin , being on the trade-route between the Lakes and the Mississippi , and therefore the outlet for all the goods that found their way west , was a live place so far as the trader and voyageur were concerned , as far back as the middle of the seventeenth century . When the first missionaries came here , in 1669 , they found traders in nearly every Indian village . The representatives of business were ahead of the representatives of God . The trader had begun to look the country over as early as 1639 ; and he had business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Indian guides , to explore the Mississippi . The man of learning came along still later , of course ? a tardy scholar . But iron was not wholly dependent upon the fur-trader , to bring it on its way . The Indians , to some extent , were traders themselves . A whole tribe would sometimes go forth to make advantageous bargains with a tribe that was farther from the source of supply . Then too , the red man was a great news-bearer , carrying all his history , the terms of his treaties , and the latest doings of the wilderness , in his head . With these traits of his character in mind , let us take a look at the far Pacific coast , at a time when no white man had as yet crossed the continent , and see how the fame of iron is coming along . In 1776 , Captain Cook came eastward round the Cape of Good Hope , and struck diagonally across the Pacific , in hope of finding a northwest passage . This was the voyage on which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a northwest passage , he did gain some further knowledge of the western shore of that continent which Drake had discovered , and which was vaguely known as New Albion . Threading his way among the South Sea Islands and finally up the American coast , he makes many stops along the way . At each stop we see canoes putting forth to meet him , and his ship swarming with strange peoples who have but one demand to make upon him : they want iron . His voyage from first to last is punctuated with this thought of iron . The call for it comes to him from island- after island , and seems to be following in his wake ; and when he reaches the coast of North America , the demand is heard again . To the reader with an ear for history , it becomes the dominant note of his narrative , recurring always and deepening in meaning . It is the voice of the Stone Age calling out for this new substance . At a little island north of the Society group , a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : In the course of my several voyages I never met with the natives of any place so much astonished as these people were upon'entering a ship . Their eyes were continually flying from object to object , the wildness of their looks fully expressing their entire ignorance about everything they saw , and strikingly marking to us that , till now , they had never been visited by Europeans , nor been acquainted with any of our commodities except iron , which , however , it was plain they had heard of , or had known it in some small quantity , brought to them at some distant period . They seemed only to understand that it was a substance much better adapted to the purpose of cutting , or of boring holes , than anything their own country produced . They asked for it by the name of kamaite , probably referring to some instrument , in the making of which iron could he usefully employed . For the same reason they frequently called iron by the name of toe , which , in their language , nifies a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we showed them some . beads they asked first what they were , and then , whether they should eat them . But on their being told that they were to be hung in their ears , they returned them as useless . They were equally indifferent as to a look . ing-glass which was offered them , and re . turned it for the same reason ; but au &; sufficiently expressed their desire for haled , and toe , which they wished might be very large . As on his second voyage , he did much traffic in nails ; and at one place he says , Several small pigs were purchased for a six-penny nail ; so that we again found ourselves in a land of plenty . ' At an island where the language of Tahiti was spoken the natives passed up some maelerel to them by means of a rope . ' This was repeated , and some small nails , or bits of iron , which they valued more than any other article , were given them . ' And at another : As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hogs and potatoes , which the people gave us in exchange for nails and pieces of iron formed something like chisels . We met with no obstruction in watering ; on the contrary , the natives assisted our men is rolling the casks to and from the pool ; and readily performed whatever , we required . Of this ' newly discovered archipelago ' of the South Seas , there were five islands which he visited . Speaking of theth generally , he says : The only iron tools , or rather bits of iron , seen amongst them , and - which they had before our arrival . were a piece of iron hoop , about two inches long , fitted into a wooden handle , and another edge-tool , which our people guessed to be made of the point of a broadsword . How they came by them I can not account for . I Having come among the Indians of the continent , which lie first touched at a point in northern California , lie I coasted along Canada and the shores of Alaska . Here the demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians along the Canadian coast he writes : ? Though our visitors behaved very peace-:1 ably , and could not be suspected of any hostile intention , we could not prevail upon any of them to come on board . They showed great readiness , however , to part with anything they had , and took from us whatever We offered in exchange , but were more desirous of iron than of any other of our articles of commerce , appearing to be 3 perfectly acquainted with the use of that metal . . . . For the various articles which they brought , they took in exchange knives ; chisels , pieces of iron and tin , nails , looking : glasses , buttons , or any kind of metal . Glass beads they were not fond of ; and cloth of every sort they rejected . From being so suspicious of a ship , the Indians , after a while of this sort II of barter , became too familiar . They hung around the vessel in their canoes , and made a practice of staying all night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties from a distance arrived every day ; meanwhile , those who had sold all they had would disappear for four or five days , and then return with fresh cargoes of skins and curiosities . At this stage of affairs Cook tells as : Nothing would go down with our visitors but metal ; and brass bad by this time supplanted iron , being so eagerly sought after that , before we left this place , hardly a bit of it was left on the ships , except what belonged to our necessary instruments . Whole suits of clothes were stripped of every button ; bureaus of their furniture ; and copper kettles , tin canisters , candle-sticks , and the like , all went to wreck . ? These Canadian Indians were already in possession of metal , although VOL. 151 ? NO. 6 , Cook says he ' never observed the least sign of their having seen ships like ours before . ' And here he makes a shrewd conjecture . The most probable way , by which we can suppose they get their iron , is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either have immediate connection with European settlements upon the continent , or receive it , perhaps , through several intermediate nations . The same may be said of the brass and copper found amongst their . Along the shore of Alaska the story was the same . These people were also desirous of iron ; but they wanted pieces eight or ten inches lodg at least , and of the breadth of three or four fingers . The points of some of their spears or lances were of that metal ; others were of copper and a few of bone , of which the points of their darts , arrows , &c.; were composed . Again Cook is puzzled to account for the presence of the metal . We were pretty certain he says , from circumstances already mentioned , that we were the first Europeans with whom they had ever communicated directly ; and it remains only to be decided from what quarter they got our manufactures by intermediate conveyance . And there can not be the least doubt of their having received these arti- ? des , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay , or the settlements on the Canadian Lakes . Thus we see that , in a voyage which took him from the South ? Pacific Ocean to a point beyond the Arctic Circle , he found that the fame of iron had preceded him all the way . It had been the same on his second voyage , three years , before , when he was going into a world so little known ' that England was ex- ' pecting him to discover a new continent in the South Pacific . It was , in a sense , the age of bone as much as the age of stone . In the South Pacific islands their chisels were bone ; and as there were no mammals of any size on these islands , a chisel was always made of the upper bone of a man 's arm . In Alaska , likewise , we find the darts and arrows pointed with ivory and bone . It is interesting to note in Cook 's narrative ( though he does not draw our attention to the point ) that among the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the spears were pointed with iron . An arrow is likely to be shot away and lost . A fish-spear is held in the hand ; or , if it does have to be thrown , it can usually be recovered . A blown-up bladder , attached to the spear with a thong , ensures its safety . Among our American Indians , it was , in a more fundamental sense , the age of bone . Captain John Smith tells us that he once met an Indian who had an old piece of bone , which he carried about with him in his pouch , and which he seemed to prize greatly . Upon being asked what it was for , he replied that he used it in shaping his flint arrowheads . The captain , probably thinking there was some secret to be discovered in this piece of bone , tried to get possession of it ; but the Indian refused to part with it because it was ' big medicine ' to him . As we now know , there was no secret about the bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusal to part with it was wholly due to a trait in human nature . A skilled workman , whether he be white or red , clings fondly to his old familiar tools , and is loath to part with one , even though he knows he can easily get another . From such meagre and incidental hints as this , in the writings of soldiers and adventurers who were little concerned with the curious questionings of modern science , did we get our first clue to the means by which the pre . Columbian Indian shaped his arrowheads . The Indian of to-day does not know . But the archmologist knows , to a certain extent , even though he may not be able to do it . The Indian made all of his arrow- and spear-heads , and like implements , out of the hard , an . stratified , glasslike rocks ; and he did it by working on this refractory material with a piece of bone . An amusing illustration of the igno. rance of the modern Indian with regard to the art of his forefathers recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which some friends of mine made to northern Wisconsin . They were a committee of the State Archmological Society , who had been sent up there to investigate Indian mounds and dig for specimens ; and they had along with them Mr. H. L. Skavlem , a pleasing old naturalist of the type of John Burroughs , who is an expert on Indian implements . Mr. Skavlem , whose summer seat is on Lake Koshkonong , in a county which almost joins corners with my own , is the only man , so far as Wisconsin archeologists know , who has acquired the art of making flint arrowheads after the manner of the pre-Columbian Indian . And I dare say he is the only one known in other parts of the world for his work has recently come into demand in public museums . Examples of it have found their way into museums in France and Norway , and lately he had a request for specimens from the Canadian Provincial Museum at Toronto . On this trip the archmological committee went up through the towns oi the Chippewa Indians , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the course of their wanderings , Mr. Skavlem picked up a mass of flint rock , and , having shattered it into fragments of workable size , occupied his spare time in shaping arrow- ' heads . This work soon attracted the ; attention of the Indians . Being wholly ! ignorant of the art , they were much amazed . They stood about , saying bnothing , while he turned out heads for bird-arrows and war-arrows , chipping the flint with apparently as little trouble as if it had been a good , crum=bly piece of Wisconsin cheese . This exploit soon began to have results . Thereafter , whenever they rived at an Indian town , the Indians would be on hand awaiting his arrival . The news of the white man 's strange ability had gone on ahead of him ; and ; there would be a curious throng following him about and watching for him to do it again . In this way Skavlem made many arrowheads of approved archmblogica , l design ; and this signal victory over the Chippewas was achieved by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , a toothbrush . In order to make arrowhealls , one needs only a piece of bone from which all , fatty matter has been re ; moved . Hence , why not a toothbrush ? At one place , ' Skavlem told me , ' I Gf thought I would test their knowledge of what I was doing . I held up an arrow before a group of Chippewas and asked them what it was . They all gazed at ore in silence , not one of them offering a word of comment . Presently an old squaw found her tongue and said , " I know . Thunder stone ! " That 's how much they know about flint-working. ' hr Wisconsin we have a little more than ten thousand Indians , most of them on the northern reservations . The oldest men among them , of pure Indian blood , have no remembrance of any tradition regarding the making of flint arrowheads . On a festival day , when the Chippewas array themselves in their finery of beadwork , and put on their bonnets of eagle feathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pry into the ancient secrets . But he might better address his inquiry to the Elks , or the United Order of Red Men . Tribal history is preserved in tales of the heroic and the supernatural , not of the commonplaces of life . When the age of iron came in , the age of stone went out of the door with as little sentiment as a modern housewife would bestow upon the old washboard when the new electric laundry was installed . It is not Indian nature to make tradition out of anything so prosaic as mere work . In other ways they are equally progressive . A couple of years ago , one of the tribes was divided into parties over the subject of the annual dance . Modern tendencies , such as the bunny-hug , ' the bear-walk , ' and other wild vagaries of the white man , had begun to creep ih . The old men , who might be called the conservatives , raised their voices in opposition to such innovations . But the younger party stood stoutly in favor of the up-to-date . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much longer than it did in this country of the seventeenth-century fur-trader ; but even there it passed out with a suddenness that was complete . Some years ago the Smithsonian Institution thought it had found an authentic pre-Columbian Indian in California . He was very secretive about his methods , and would not let them see him at work . Finally they outwitted him by placing a mirror so that it would transmit the necessary knowledge ; and when they found him pecking away at the flint with an old nail , rather inexpertly , they knew they had not found a true flint-worker . In order to do that , they would have to come to Wisconsin and visit the lakeside cottage of my friend Skavlem . As Charles E. Brown , curator of the State Historical Museum , recently wrote me , ' He is a real naturalist , with a wide knowledge of birds , animals , plants , and rocks ; and he chips flint with the same facility as the old-time Indian . We call him the John Burroughs of Wisconsin . ' Besides being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archaeological specimens , and has been of great help in mapping the many effigy-mounds to be found in this state . But it is his skill in flint-working , deliberately and purposely cultivated , which makes him of unique interest to the archaeologist . As for the practical objects which would actuate a man to cultivate this familiarity with stone and bone , there is a spirit of pure science behind it , and a finality of investigation which the true archaeologist will readily appreciate . And the general reader , who has no doubt puzzled his head in vain every time he looked at an exhibit of Indian arrowheads , may now find his questions easily answered . One day , not long ago , I went over to Mr. Skavlem 's hOme , with the idea of giving the operation close scrutiny , and getting him to make an arrowhead for the editor of the Atlantic . My errand turned into a social visit , so that , although I had arrived shortly after dinner , it was growing dark before the object of my call again occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his library , which entirely covers one wall of his small living-room , when the waning light warned us that it Was high time to be getting at the arrowhead ; whereupon we hurried down to the cellar . Here , before the dimly lighted window , were no tools but a piece of bone in a wood handle , and a block of oak . While I held my watch , he made a well-shaped arrowhead , with tang , barbs , and notch complete , in the space of eleven minutes . In the bad light he had the misfortune to break it when it was nearly done , so that he had to start over ant alter it into an arrowhead of smaller size . He had really made two arrow . heads in that time . It was not in. tended as a museum specimen , but an example of the average arrowhead picked up in the ' fields . ' The Indian was not much of a mechanic , ' he en . plained , continuing our visit as he worked ; ' and when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be careful not to make it too good . ' Mounted on cards , he has examples of the various styles of Indian arrowheads made out of all the materials that the Indians used ? flint , cheat , quartzite , jasper , chalcedony , and black obsidian . These are of his own manufacture . Prominent among them , catching the eye with their jewel-like glint ; are bird-arrows , beautifully shaped and barbed , which look as if they might have been made out of emerald and topaz . These were fash. ioned with the same piece of bone , and in no great length of time , out of the bottoms-of beer bottles , brown and green . While they are not intended as mere curiosities , they excite the great . est wonder of the layman , who naturally thinks them the hardest to make . This is a mistaken conclusion . Quartzite will scratch glass , anal some flint will scratch quartz . The rocks are harder than glass , and no less brittle . As an Indian always selected for his arrowheads the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt that he would have made use of glass if he had had the glass to work with . He did make use of black obsidian when he could get it ; and obsidian is nothing more or less than natural , or volcanic , glass . Eleven minutes in Skavlem 's darkening cellar begin to shed light ; and it is a light which would never transmit itself through the polished glass of museum cases . Suddenly you exclaim , ' Why , it was not such a great loss for an Indian ( to shoot away one of those beautiful arrows and never find it again ! I had always thought ? ' And who is there among us who has not thought it , as we stood gazing imaginatively into museum cases at delicate bird-arrows , and detachable poison-arrows , and big war-arrows intended to kill buffaloes and men ? What I a tragedy to an Indian to shoot at a bird and miss it ! What a gambling with his long labor to draw upon a duck ! What careful searches he must have made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there hid themselves with all the sagacity of a modern collar-button ! We sympathize with him , knowing that , in his day as well as ours ; there must have been this same ' perversity of inanimate things . ' And finally we have said : ' What a waste of human effort it was to have to depend for a living upon the shooting of such ammunition ! ' Museums are dedicated to wonder ; 6 : but Skavlem 's cellar is not . It is there done away with by means of a block and a bone . I dare say that prehistoric loan was more concerned over the 1 : straight stick with which he had made his feathered shaft than he was over l the loss of the arrowhead . He would hardly spend a great part of his day ! nutting for that , when he could so easily make another . Thus the usefulness of a twentieth-century arrow-maker begins to make itself manifest . As everyone knows , who has posted himself theoretically upon some practical operation and then gone away with the intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / always something he forgot to ask . You did not get quite thoroughly into I it ; and then you wished you were back at your original source of information . Archeology , so far as the Stone Age is concerned , deals mostly with tools . Many archaeologists have made experiments with these tools , using the various drills , and boring out catlinite pipes by way of practical knowledge . In this way a man gets down to details , makes new observations , and becomes more of an authority on the catlinite pipe or the bead of wampum . But how about making these tools themselves , setting out with nothing but a piece of bone , and making yourself familiar with the kind of tool that long ago decayed ? Why not start from the ground up ? This was the question which Skavlem asked himself , and which made him dissatisfied with the more use of flint implements , or the making of stone axes by the pecking and grinding of stone upon stone . Behind the flint tool was another tool that made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to rediscover its possibilities . It was the age of stone only in the sense that the stone implement bears everlasting testimony of itself , while the tool of bone decays . Some of these arrow-making bones have resisted decay enough to preserve their form ; and Skavlem has found a few in such a state of preservation that he has been able to do a little chipping with them . If the New England farmer of to-day were able to plough up all the shoulder-blades of moose that were formerly used for hoes , and all the needles and bodkins and awls and flint-working tools that the Indian had ever used , he would probably be in a quandary whether to call it the age of stone or the age of bone . The making of III an arrowhead is the last word in simplicity , so far as the outward procedure is concerned . It may readily be understood by anyone who has been housekeeping long enough to have had a few accidents with glass . Possibly ? or I should say probably ? you have been coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mirror or other cherished object in your hands ; and you have had the misfortune to strike it against a hard corner , in such a way that a piece was bit right out of the surface of it . The piece was a thin semicircle of glass , with knifelike edges , and somewhat the shape of a shell . This , to all intents and purposes , is the conchoidal fracture . ' An Indian made his arrowheads simply by breaking such pieces out of a piece of flint , always working inward from the edge . It was never done by hammering . Such a method does not allow of that deliberate control which is necessary ; and the force required would break off the more delicate details , so that the barbs could never be shaped . It is done wholly by placing the bone against the edge and using pressure . Thus the material is broken off , chip after chip . It is evident that , if you are to have any control over the shape of the work , these chips can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming the body , or heavier part , of the arrow , the chips may be long and large , striking inward halfway across the breadth of the arrow , or even farther ; but in shaping the notches , with the shank and the sharp little barbs , the chips must be smaller and the work more delicate . You must have control over the size of the chips ; and this is determined by the amount of pressure you bring against the edge , while , at the same time , you push downward to separate it from the surface . I have said that you press downward , that being the natural way to exert a strong pressure . To do this , the flint must be held firmly in some way , as over the edge of a board or block ; and the greater part of the flint must project , so that the larger chips shall be free to break off . But to hold it firmly in this position with the fingers is hardly practicable . And any viselike sort of arrangement will hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly moved about in shaping it . After a little experience , the practical way suggests itself . You cut a slot in your oak block , a quarter of an inch deep and about as wide . Now , when you place the edge of your flint in this , it does not stand straight up , neither does it fall over on its side ; it is at an angle of forty-five degrees , and the greater part of its surface is free to let loose the flakes as they are pressed off . By placing a finger of the left hand at the base of the fragment of flint , it is held easily in place , and you may now exert your strongest downward pressure as you work around the edge . The flint may be turned over readily into any position , as you work on it ; and it will keep tumbling about in its slot as the deft workman virtually hue .. ries it into shape . This is all there is , practically , to the making of an arrow . head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in your head . The work , it will be noted , is all done by pressing the end of bone firmly against the edge , to make it take hold , and at the same time pushing downward . In no case would it be possible to take a piece off your arrow by applying the tool to its face . A piece of bone would not remove an objection . able hump in this way ; neither would a piece of steel , unless you were to hit it such a blow as to break the flint . It is this peculiar fracture which is accommodating you ; and the white man gets the same results as the Indian by taking the same advantage of it . But , ' says the attentive reader , I have seen arrows where these chips were taken right out of the face of the arrow . The marks did not lead from the edge . ' True enough . But these marks are the remainder of larger chips , which did strike inward from the edge , when the fragment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the marks that were on the fragment before it was trimmed up at all . An Indian , in order to save himself unnecessary work , would select a fragment that was somewhere near the site of the arrow he intended to make . The bone employed is , as I have said , about the size of the handle of a toothbrush , and it is flattened down to an edge like that of a dull chisel , though not , of course , with a view to using it like a chisel . The edge of the bone stands at right angles to the edge of the flint , and is firmly pressed against it in that position . The bone is made about three-eighths of an inch wide , in order that it may be strong enough to bear the downward pressure ; and it is sharpened to a point for three reasons ? to enable you to do fine work and get into details , to make it take a firm hold of the edge of the flint , and to bring all the pressure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fracture . When we examine one of those chips that are knocked off the edge of a piece of glass , we see that it is not only shell ! like in form , but also has a slight indication of ridges ? little waves or ripples surrounding the point where the force was applied . In like manner , your edge of bone seems to radiate its force eat into the surrounding material . The workman thus regulates the size and nature of his chips , taking off big ones to bring the work into shape , or Little ones to put a set of saw-teeth on the arrow . It is the amount of pressure against the flint , together with the push downward , the one proportioned to the other , which determines the size of the chip : it is not dependent upon the amount of surface which the tool takes hold of . It is all very simple in procedure , though not at all easy to do . Being both simple and difficult , it is atrade ; and one in which the skilled workman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Thomas Wilson , whose work on prehistoric art is a standard in its line , says that the work is done by pushing at an angle of forty-five degrees . His description is misleading , because it conveys the idea that the bone is held at a certain angle to the work . The work is not done by an angle which may be determined by the eye , but by the combination of two pressures which are determined by the fingers . Mr. Skavlem called my attention to this attempt of the archwologist to explain the use of the tool ; and it conveys so little of the true idea , such as a man would get from a practical contact with flint , that I have thought it worth while to describe the process at length . Iv I can not drop this hard and brittle subject here without the feeling that I ought to leave the reader better acquainted with my friend Mr. Skavlem . All the world loves a lover ; and I have never met a man who represented the lover of Nature so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is not a writer , nor a speaker , nor anything that reaches out for fame . With him , Nature is her own reward ; and she still continues to reward hini , in the eighth decade of his life . He knows the birds , the animals , the rocks , and the flowers . Every wren that selects its place for a home becomes his companion for the summer ; and he has humorous appreciation of its strong character and little household ways . Along with this love of Nature , he has the strict truth-telling instinct of the pure scientist ? all the more so , perhaps , because of this profound simplicity of mind . But he has interested me particularly because of his early beginnings as contrasted with what he finally became . ' We know what we are , ' says Ophelia , but know not what we may be . This problem is best solved when a man has passed three score and ten , and finds himself with a beard turned white and a whole life to look back upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let me say , is one of the most interesting forms of prophecy . The self-educated man spends a large part of his life groping toward his destiny . And right here he may have a great advantage over the man who has become committed to a vocation too early in life , and feels that he must keep on , even if he has chosen wrong . H. L. Skavlem , when he was a young man in a Wisconsin farming community , discovered that he liked to play billiards . The skill of eye and hand appealed to him . Amid the ruder employments of pioneer life , this fine touch and feeling for the weight of the ball , and the shrewd calculation of angles of incidence , gave him an outlet for something that was strong within him ; and he became a confirmed billiard-player . It cost him little , because he was usually the victor ; and so he could play as much as he liked . As he grew more skillful at the game , it dawned upon him that he was becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; and it was getting hold of him . Suddenly , one day , he placed his cue in the rack and said , This is the end of it for rne . ' And it was . As he tells this at the age of seventy-three , there is a glint in his eye which shows that the billiard cue is not really a thing of the past with him , but rather a passion long renounced . Billiards was his game . In these retired-farmer towns of the Middle West , where farmers retire too soon and often without a shadow of excuse , it is the well-worn pack of cards that must bear the brunt of eking out the empty latter years . Some of them play all day , and come hack to play in the evening ; and when no opponent can be found , they play solitaire . To gar. lem , cards never made any appeal . The nature of the game bores him . In bil ? Herds , depending wholly upon skill , and appealing to a certain pride of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being a farm-boy by training , and having now a large city acquaintance , he was elected to the office of ' sheriff . With his taste for active employment among men , and a rugged physique de . rived from Norwegian ancestors , he h well selected for the position . Here one might expect him to go into politics , the office of sheriff being generally con. sidereal a long step in that direction . But he had no taste for the mere political ? cal side of his situation , its cornpre. raises and connivings appealing to him as little as did the game of cards . And so , having attended to the duties of the office , he stepped out without having paved the way to further preferment . Politics was not his line . He had always been a hunter , and , as he grew older , he found himself with a settled taste for the out-of-doors , In the adjoining county is a lake , nine miles by four , which , as its feeding . grounds are especially attractive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the West . Every autumn Skavlem was at the lake , gun in hand , consorting with hunters and making the outdoors his hobby . In the meantime , having an inquiring mind , he had been growing familiar with the scientific side of nature . And along with this scientific bent he had a love of animals , which , as he had been raised on a farm , first mini . fested itself in his knowledge and under . standing of horses . I was recently talking with him upon the subject of histology , in which a mutual friend is h interested , and I asked him what gnu Oho thought of the theory of curing hu'an ailments by manipulation . ' Well , ' his said , ' I have rubbed and kneaded too many horses into shape , and put ; them on their feet again , to be a coinjplete skeptic regarding that method of But it was the lake , and the out-of ; doors , that really charmed and held , him .

And now , instead Hof merely hunting in the fall , he stayed : there the greater part of the year . iThus , at the age of fifty , he reversed the , programme of the average farmer .

What , then , became of Skavlem when he retired to the country and sat down on the shore of his Wisconsin lake ? For one thing , he became a botanist . The subject had always interested him as he came in practical contact with it , more especially the botany of water-plants . Finally , he produced his monograph on the Potomageton pectinatus , in which he held , contrary to the belief of all hunters and scientific writers , that the canvasback does not get its distinctive flavor from feeding on wild-celery buds . The government later issued a bulletin on the subject , setting forth evidence that reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ akavlem , the pioneer , was not mentioned . A long time later , however , the editor , Emmaline Moore of the Department of Zoology and Botany of Vassar College , very graciously made amends . Having learned of his monograph and the date of it , she wrote him a letter acknowledging the oversight , and complimenting him , in 1915 , uponwork that he had done in 1904 . Many elusive circumstances , partly botanical and partly due to the anatomy of the duck , had misled observers and perpetuated in science what was mere tradition and hearsay . ' Skepticism , at least in science , ' says Skavlem , ' is the basis of human progress . ' But it was in ornithology , more than in botany , that Skavlem found himself truly at home . The largest collection of native birds in Wisconsin is the work of his hand . Having completed it and put it in order , he presented it to the city of Janesville . He humorously describes himself as ' an old-fashioned naturalist ? one that knows a little of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curator of the State Historical Society at Madison , and bird-lovers generally , take him more seriously than that . He is the ' John Burroughs of Wisconsin . ' This is a good description of him , both as to personality and as to his attitude toward nature in general ; though he has a craggy brow , which is more like that of Bryant . Unlike Burroughs , however , he has little inclination to write . The State Historical Society has recently been urging him to write some articles upon the making of stone implements , but so far with no success . The nature-lover in him tells him to write ; the pure scientist ? whose respect is all for the thoroughgoing and accurate ? tells him not to do so . ' He confided to me that a scientist is on the downward path when he starts writing ' just to please people . ' Such is the literary philosophy of Skavlem . But there is , I think , a deeper reason why he does not write . He takes it out in first-hand contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake has become a Mecca for his friends ? bird-lovers , geologists , hunters , and archaeologists . It is the social instinct 810 THREE that drives on your true writer . He is reaching out for people to share the world with . But when a man is so truly in love with Nature that she is her own reward , and when this brings a man just the human contact he needs , he is likely to put off the labors of the pen . Like Socrates and Diogenes and Coleridge , he gathers his disciples about him . One might wonder , sometimes , why Christ did not write . There is a temptation to philosophize here ; but we began with billiards , and the discerning reader always expects a writer to draw his observations to a point . We have no doubt raised the query , What has billiards to do with the career of a naturalist ?

The piece of land he bought on the lake was on the site of Carcajou , an Indian village rich in aboriginal remains . He found here much to interest him . And this to . gether with his growing acquaintance among the archeologists of the state , turned his mind strongly toward the problems of the Stone Age . He went behind the flint implements , and the experiments in using them , to the art of making them . And in the interest of pure science , he resolved to start life all over again , beginning with a bone , To members of the State Archeological Society , and to certain professors at the University , he is known for his re . markable control of the conchoidal fracture .
