THE problem of work in the world is a problem of poetry . To state the matter in these terms is to raise questions , if not derision . To speak of poetry and of work together at any time would suggest to most hearers two separate interests , as though the words brought into contrast the luxury and the discipline of life . At any time such a juxtaposition would raise the unsympathetic query whether when the worker has accomplished his hours we shall advise him to dilate his soul with a book of verse , or whether the poet should sing of the delight of labor , in the hope of casting upon drudgery some alleviating magic . If the mention of poetry and work together produces little enthusiasm , the reason probably is that we understand but vaguely the nature of poetry . Many brilliant definitions of poetry have set the matter clear enough before us in times past and in our own day . In Max Eastman 's " Enjoyment of Poetry " the first chapter , which describes " poetic people , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are interested in crossing the river , and others are interested merely in getting across .. All the people in the world , or all the moods of people , said Mr. Eastman , may be divided in the same way . Those who are interested in arriving at ends are the practical people ; and those who realize , as they go through an experience , all the quality it has to yield , are the poetic folk . There could hardly be a simpler or truer indication of the poetic attitude . A statement of it , however , can be quoted from a book already immortal . " Not the fruit of experience , " says Walter Pater at the close of his study of the Renaissance , " not the fruit of experience but experience itself is the end " ? that is , in Mr. Eastman 's words , not getting across the river but being aware of the experience of crossing , is success in life . In other words , the essence of poetry is the realization of life , of the flavor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we see or hear or do or think or feel ? Habit dulls our sight and our hearing , and the tendency of all experience is , in the old phrase , to live much rather than well , to survive many moments without distinguishing each moment as it passes . From time to time , however , impelled by some unfamiliar stimulus , we become unusually sensitive to what life at that moment is , and such a realization is poetry  --  not verse , but the living poetry which may go into verse or into some other art or which may simply be absorbed in conduct . This poetic experience may be of a very humble physical order , no more than the exhilaration of the senses after a good night 's rest , when all colors of the landscape , all sounds of the fields or of the streets , seem unusually vivid ; or it may be the exultation of a Newton when he first imagines the true motion of heavenly bodies ; but in either case whether the experience realized is of the senses or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of the spirit . Nothing is more natural than such a realizing of life . If as we grow older the ability to seize the flavor of experience fades from us , it is only because we are jaded by unreflective living ; at least we begin life sensitive to the world about us . Wordsworth is an inevitable example . One desire directed his days from boyhood to old age  --  to have a passionate acquaintance with life . There might seem to be a break in his career when he abandoned hope of sharing personally in the French Revolution and took up , in a quiet English village , his daily round of plain living and high thinking ; the change , however , is only on the surface , and is more apparent than real . In both periods he desired to live passionately . Having learned by experience , however , that immense and feverish activity does not end in a deeper realization of life , but rather in a deadening to it , he tried the other method ; he relaxed his nerves and opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands upon him . And in an age of increasing activity , of more and more cruel noise and friction , men turned to Wordsworth as a seer , a prophet ; even those who cared little for verse could see that happiness lay in the refinement rather than in the number of our sensations , and that the simple life was the solution for modern perplexities  --  the life , that is , in which men keep themselves calm and steady to receive that wealth of experience which might be different in quality hut which could not be greater in quantity in one place than in another . Almost at the same time something threatened to take from modern society any opportunity to become sensitive . The invention of machines , the application of power to looms , the- organizing of the factory , that symbol of our latest world , took from us not only leisure to observe life as it streams by , but at last even the ability to observe it when we have the leisure . It is considered in some quarters the sign of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of machinery . " Too bad that life shouldn't-continue picturesque and poetic and that sort of thing , but machinery has come to stay , and we 'll have to put up with it . " It may have come to stay , but apparently they are least willing to put up with it who have to use it ; they seem more and more reluctant to use it for any long period at a time ; they show an invariable delight in getting free of it , into some other form of work . They express their discontent by demanding higher wages , but higher wages can not make them happy , for the machine has taken from them the capacity to distinguish among experiences , to realize the quality of life  --  in short , to find the poetry of it . A college class might judge Pater academic , but a group of tired mill-hands would hear their own thoughts when he says : " To burn always with this hard , gemlike flame , to maintain this ecstasy , is success in life . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to form habits ; for , after all , habit is relative to a stereotyped world , and meanwhile it is only the roughness of the eye that makes any two persons , things , situations , seem alike . " Unfortunately , the machine and the factory make a stereotyped world , compel the eye to be rough , blot out distinctions of persons and things . To the shoemaker each shoe that leaves his hands has its personality and therefore its interest ; each is an adventure toward the perfect shoe he will some day make . In the factory , however , the perfection sought for is an identical quality in all the shoes . When Wordsworth found joy in the " mighty sum of things forever seeking " he assumed that the innumerable experiences of life are infinitely varied . If the touch of the universe , however , should turn out to be but one finger laid on the same nerve incessantly , without variation or hope of respite , we should not grow more sensitive to it ; we should become callous , or we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of machinery in the world , we should not thereby , with any certainty , diminish drudgery or the callousness that monotony induces . So much at least should be said on behalf of the machine advocates . Doubtless the woman who made garments by hand often missed the poetry of life as she plied her needle , and the first news of a sewing-machine was to her the tidings of leisure and release . For those women who do not earn their living by sewing , it would be foolish to deny that the sewing-machine has proved indeed a useful instrument , a means of escape from fatigue . But when we see the men and women at their machines in a sweat-shop , we question whether the mechanical invention was a blessing or a snare . The inventor thought he had solved a problem for humanity , but the solution brought a new world into being , with problems of its own . In America we have become exponents of efficiency and prophets of scientific management . Certainly there is no reason why in some good sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be managed at all should not be managed scientifically ; but when we reflect on the large possibility of loss in what we call efficiency , and the not inconsiderable element in scientific management which is really unscientific , we find it easy to be pessimistic or even cynical . Many waste motions in all labor can be saved by forethought ; it is better , for example , that the bricklayer should have the bricks on a table near the level at which he works than that he should stoop to the ground for every brick . - So far without question scientific management confers blessing upon us . But this diminution of drudgery does not in itself make the bricklayer 's toil more interesting . There is nothing in efficient management , so far , to teach him the meaning of the house he puts up , or to make it in any way his personal concern . Moreover , scientific management goes further and suggests that labor , which once was varied , should be subdivided and thereby made monotonous ; that one-man should give all his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to a very brief series of motions . At this point we begin to talk of the maximum product from the point of view of the producer , but from the point of view of the laborer we begin to think of hell . We are not surprised when several passages in Taylor 's book on scientific management advise us that for certain kinds of work we should seek a man of dull intelligence or of no intelligence at all , since a finer brain would be wasted on such drudgery . From the point of view of the employer this may be good sense , but what shall we think of it from the point of view of those to whom it seems unfortunate that any of the human race should remain dull or brutish , or should be set to work which will make them so ? It would be profitable to know what Europeans think of us , in this matter of the poetry of life . They will grant that we are idealists . But idealism and poetry are not quite the same thing . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our execution of them , he will not altogether admit that we get the flavor of our energy as we exercise it , nor that we realize emotionally or intellectually the bearings of our own good intentions . We are becoming a bit mechanical , he feels , even in our virtues ; we care more for efficiency than for life . At the end of the war , a report on industrial conditions in the United States was made by a labor commission to the government of a small country allied with us . The condition of the small country at that moment was so wretched that any American would have said his own land was , in comparison , absolutely happy . Yet the report , based upon interviews with laboring men and employers here , and upon inspection of many of our industrial centers , concluded that Europe had quite as much to avoid as to imitate in our devotion to efficiency . M. Brieux has said as much for the French opinion of us in " Les AmericainS Chez Nous . " In significant phrases the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . " Economy of effort , maximum product , Taylorism , as you say . . . . I call it terrorism . . . You must stand in front of a machine and obey it , wait on it . . . . Tick , tick , tick , steady as clock-work , always driving on , driving on , driving on . It never gets tired ; it is steel , it ca n't think . . . . And you must obey it and move with it . . . . If you miss once , it rings a bell , and registers your failure . I tell you , it is madness . . . . It is humiliating . You feel that if you are there at all , it is only because the engineers have not yet discovered how to replace you by a more efficient connecting-rod or spring . . . . Each nation has its own . character . In France the workman likes to know what he is doing ; he likes sometimes to flirt with his work , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the pleasure of trying to do better . When you 've finished a job , you caress it with your hand , and you say : ' It 's done , sure enough : it will do as it is ; but I 'll give it just a touch here and there . ' " Not every American will agree that M. Brieux has portrayed us correctly , sympathetic though he is , but he has indicated for us what are the ideals of his own countrymen . Not all nations , fortunately , have been swept into the maelstrom of unreflecting activity . France is the notable instance of a whole people preferring the poetic experience even at the cost of commercial advancement and physical luxury . There is a profound reason , therefore , why poets and artists from the rest of the world should make their pilgrimage to this one land where life is still lived simply and , as far as the outer eye can see , quietly , but where spiritual and intellectual excitement is most intense and most refined . Indeed , France is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the United States and to Great Britain , an incarnate question whether any place shall be left in the world for a people who would rather live simply and poetically than efficiently and monotonously . If the American or the Englishman does not find himself comfortable in France , he need not go there ; but he ought to observe that the Frenchman finds our superior railways , elevators , and bathrooms but an inadequate substitute for that higher kind of convenience which he has left at home  --  the privilege of enjoying the moments of existence as they pass , and of selecting from them the experiences which have meaning . Shall we say that the United States is not France , and that with us the question of poetry in our lives is an academic rather than a vital issue ? In our workmen , at least , it begins to become vital . They feel very much as the French workman does ; they do not like a mechanical life ; they have insisted on leisure , and they will insist on more of it . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the difference between the French and the American points of view . The French employer still respects the workman 's desire to be a craftsman , an artist , a maker , rather than a " hand . " Until the American employer understands and encourages this desire , we can not be happy again in our work , nor can he be happy in his  --  forhe too , alas , has missed for the most part the poetry of life . And if we have more leisure , we must have the means and the training for spending it poetically , not on the pleasures which pass the time , but on those which give quality and distinction to each fragment of time as it passes . Here is a gigantic task in education . It is worth our while to plead for more attention to it , for the sake of poetry , or , if the word " poetry " still frightens the practical , then for the sake of a better kind of efficiency ; for if all spiritual meaning departs from the labor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore the far off end to which that labor contributes , we shall become desperate even to the point of starving before we will work at all . In the Driftway THE Drifter walked briskly along the road and the gorgeous , flaming autumn marched with him shoulder to shoulder . Gray branches bowed with bittersweet were on his right hand , and a young maple whose leaves were pure gold on his left . He had just come from an orchard where the branches , heavy with ripe fruit , bent and touched the earth . He knew that if he were to climb the elm tree just ahead , whose trunk was wreathed with blood-red creeper , he would see not only the shining ribbon of the Hudson but Bear Mountain in all its vivid autumn beauty . He could feel his soul expanding genially as his lungs expanded with the clear , sharp air . Life was very good , and all dull and dusty things were a thousand miles away . There was no particular reason , he reflected , why they should not remain so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oak beams had withstood the weather for upwards of 200 years ; it boasted not one fire-place but two , each big enough to hold a six-foot log with ease ; it was set in a valley so beautiful and gracious at every season of the year that it was impossible to tell which was most desirable ; why not stay there , and forever abandon all less simple things , even driftways ? Just then , for no reason at all , the Drifter remembered that he had forgotten to order the winter 's coal as he had promised , and that the electrician was coming next day to do something to the electric wires ; also that he had an appointment with a man for lunch . Life , after all , was not simple ; it was unutterably complex . And while it was quite possible to settle permanently in his house in the valley , it was unlikely that he ever would . He reached absent-mindedly in his pocket and pulled forth  --  a railroad timetable . WHILE never in the least able to sympathize with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silk shirts by workmen , the Drifter always had been puzzled to understand why anyone should want to wear a silk shirt . The Drifter has at last been enlightened by the explanation of Captain Kelly of the New York police who apologized for not interfering with the waving of the American flag and the singing of the Star Spangled Banner which so effectively prevented a lecture by Major George Haven Putnam . " The audience , " protested the doughty police captain , " was a well-dressed and educated one and not an audience the police could have sailed into with their night sticks .
