" Be bold ! Be bold ! " was a favorite Occidental maxim of the late , sainted Dr. Sun Yat-sen ( TIME , March 23 , 1925 ) , founder of China 's present Nationalist Government . Nearly always the tail end of the maxim ( " . . . but not too bold ! " ) was docked in quotation by dynamic , heroic Sun Yatsen . Last week it seemed that the penchant for daring of Saint Sun was cropping out strongly in his son , Mr. Sun Fo , who is Chinese Minister of Railways and Reconstruction . Without batting either of his eyes , Mr. Sun coolly asked legislative approval for a 50-year program of public works to cost the breath-taking sum of 12 billion 500 million dollars . Bold and ten times bold , this scheme would commit the fledgling , two-year-old Nationalist Government to pour out every year , for public works alone , a treasure half as large as the stupendous annual tribute which the Great Powers hope to wring from Germany in Reparations . China would spend $250,000,000 each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annually , depending on the decision of J. P. Morgan and others now in Paris . <P> Seemingly quite oblivious that he was proposing the impossible , Mr. Sun told the Nationalist Congress in Nanking ( see p. 28 ) that China " should " raise $100,000,000 a year in taxes for his public works program , " should " borrow another $100,000,000 annually from the Great Powers , and " should " issue $50,000,000 of " Reconstruction Bonds " every twelvemonth . Thus , said Mr. Sun , China " could " raise the annual $250,000,000 requisite to carry out the following Sun Program : 1 ) Complete the $3,000,000 tomb of Saint Sun Yat-sen in Nanking , a project already well begun ; 2 ) Rebuild Nanking as a " modern capital , " with a " White Hall " for the President of China and " Six Civic Quarters " - governmental , educational , commercial , industrial , residential and celestial-the latter to be the " Purple Hills Quarter " containing the tomb of Saint Sun ; 3 ) Level the walls of Ancient Nanking as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XIV ( 1638-1715 ) and lay out on their foundations a " Parisian " circle of boulevards 150 feet wide ; 4 ) Construct throughout China 20,000 miles of railway , 10,000 miles of motor highways , and literally innumerable flood control works and civic buildings in the provinces .
