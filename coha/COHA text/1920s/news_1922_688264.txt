txt A decision , said to be the first fixing the responsibility of banking institutions in the handling of drafts for customers where an error is made by the latter has just been handed down by Justice ' ilerney of the Supreme Court . The decision was in a suit instituted by J. A. Van Brunt &; Co. , Inc. , dealers in chemicals , against the Guaranty Trust Company , for damages alleged to have been caused by the failure of the defendant to render prompt service in collecting a draft for money due for goods shipped to Martin &; Martin of Buenos Aires . The draft , with a bill of lading covering the goods shipped was drawn against Martin Brothers of Buenos Aires , a different firm from Martin &; Martin . The draft was forwarded by the defendant to its agent , the Banco Nacionale of Argentina , which sent out the customary notice to Martin Brothers . Lack of knowledge on the part of this firm caused delay pending inquiry , and later it escaped notice altogether . This resulted in a delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the error in names . On being informed of the error the defendant cabled the Banco Nationale correction and the draft was thereupon presented to Martin &; Martin . But this firm had in the meantime gone into liquidation and the goods involved had depreciated in value . The draft was refused and the goods rejected . They were later sold at a loss and this lose represented the claim of the plaintiff . Justice Tierney held that any failure on the part of the Banco Nationale to present the draft promptly did not af , feet the situation because of the error ? in the name , and that therefore no damage or cause of action could arise from the facts . His opinion , according to Frank M. Patterson , counsel for the defendant , defines the law In the case for the first time . Part of the opinion , reads : " What the plaintiff complains of is not that the draft was not promptly presented , but that It was not advised at the time that the draft should have been presented , that acceptance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lading covering title to a valuable shipment of marketable commodity , evidencing an intended transaction of =ale and delivery , of which the market price was subject to change from time to time . " The refusal of acceptance would leave the commodity in the hands of the plaintiff for other disposit.on . Under such circumstances , it might he hold to have been the duty of the defendant to have notified the plaintiff by the quickest method of transmission . The consequence of a failure to do so would be to impose a loss upon the plaintiff of the difference between what might have been realized from a sale of the goods then and what it realized when it did learn of the refusal of acceptance . " It is pointed out that the complaint in the : ewe did not contain allegations that a loss , had been incurred . It explained that payment for the goods was to have br en made by it thirty-day sight draft to he ? accepted by the purchaser upon pr , .. sentation of tit documents showing that shipment had been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin Brothers instead , the plaintiff put it out of its power to comely with those terms of sale . The contract with Martin le Martin is no lea ! ore of darnag- , s . If they accepted delivery of the goods it would be by eome new agreement of purchase and there is no reason to suppose that they would have paid more than the then ruarlee price . The complaint shows a breach of contract , but no facts to estanlith that any loss was incurred . "
