Rhapsody Over a Coffee Cup IN the Graben the Holy Trinity soars from ? the marketplace on clouds of solid marble : the Son , stripped to bronze , graceful as some lesser divinity , with shoulders of sunbeaten gold , bears aloft the triumphant cross ; God the Father , bearded in bronze , one divine , bright thigh hung over the globe , sits on a broad bottom contemplating his potence ; the Holy Spirit descends , in the form of a white stone dove . Saints and angels , cribbed from Perugino and despoiled of their colors , stand below in-androgynous adoration . The imperial donor kneels at the base in the stiff posture of a figure on a tomb , offering praises for the deliverance of Vienna from the plague of 1393 . Putti ascend and descend indifferently , mute in stone . But here in the Stadtpark one sits at tables painted a light green and regards the Pavilion . The sunlight is strained through leaves , the grass is green as in spring , the gravel appears ' newly washed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee , and pale and raspberry tinted ices . The heavy brown liquor is sweetened and covered with a foam of ' cream . A newsboy with a close-cropped , scurvy head edges his muddy-fringed and overpatched raggedness between the tables . On a bench under the linden trees , a square kerchief over the strings of her greasy hair , her brown hide wrinkled like a wrung-out scrubbing cloth , an old peasant sits heeding the violins . The American lady at my left , with the face like an unfortunate horse and the two agile palms , explains to her French companions that New York rises from the sea on clouds and the skyscrapers soar through forty flights of steel and concrete to achieve their name . In Saint Stephan 's , to the right of the altar , is the tomb of Rudolph IV , Duke of Austria . About the base , crocodiles with the dugs of bitches give - suck to their crawling young , and dogs with the long lean tails of hairless rats commit obscenities among themselves . Armored reptiles are worried by hounds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tails of wingless griffons . All the grotesquery of some fourteenth century and very German Caillot is there , carved from the brain to adorn the rest of a Hapsburg . On the steps , of the bookstore opposite sits , and for three days now has sat , a young man with a brown-speckled , not unhandsome face , nursing his poverty . He neither moves nor begs , but sits , turning on passers-by his dark , hurt look , his dirty wool socks sliding over his cracked and leaky shoes . ' // Ina small hotel in the Mariahilferstrasse a diminutive English lady sits among her Baedekers . Last year she travelled through Spain with a courier , and saw Cordoba of the Moors ' and the bull-fighting at Madrid . This year she is touring the Tyrol , second class , with a handbag bought in Regent Street , an umbrella and an Italian grammar . She carries her meagre lunch in a reticule ; her one regret is that the tea on the Austrian trains is invariably sweetened and her doctors have forbidden her sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her rain-proof in covering her tiny body reveals her British soul . She wears two pairs of stockings , one of cotton and one of wool , to protect her from the insects . Her watch is secured to her purse by a safety-pin , and her pince-nez is forever on the point of falling . " There are so many Beauty Spots here , " she says , " and now that I have seen all on the upper route , I shall return to Innsbruck by the lower , spending a day or two in each place . I shall never come back here again , and I know I could never again do it so cheaply . And there is so much to see in Vienna ; I have a great fondness for pictures ; I once spent two years in London just to do the museums and the galleries . If only my son were here I should be walking on clouds . " Next winter she will spend in Florence in a pension near the Pitti Palace . She is well past the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sands of Abyssinia . One remembers Lady Hester Stanhope and nods respectfully to the spirit of the British Empire . But to the Stadtpart ( here there being no tea ) she will not come , as now this female buffoonery comes with the massive pomp of a pachyderm . Stiffened by an armor of stays , she trails the gravel with voluminous silks , twenty years old and the color of dead leaves . She lifts the nose of a Tiberius and surveys , unseeingly , the rabble ; the emergence of her ponderous chin from the tulle folds of her boa is an event . Her veil of blond lace does not conceal the preciousness of her earrings . The Oberkellner comes tilting . Behind her trails an obscure , washed-out girl , her paid corn-papion ? Lunisequa attending the moon . The orchestra plays Lehar ; the young Viennese exquisite with his too-tight coat and his absurdly loose trousers leans on his cane and imagines himself another Anatole . A one-legged beggar in a grimy gray uniform of the Austrian Infantry hobbles at the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap . The music melts on the ear like some delicious rose-tinted ice on the tongue . The head-waiter 's formerly satin lapels are creased and shiny like black leather . In the Josefsplatz , before the old palace of the Hapsburgs , Joseph II , the unrenowned son of Maria Theresa , rides a slow pacing horse , laureled in black bronze ? an Austrian imitation of a French imitation of a Roman Emperor . And the old palace is dingy and fine , with the sombre air of a fortress . But the new Hofburg of Francis Joseph turns in a semilune of white marble , shouldering a hundred columns . In the centre is a grandiose portico ' with a balustrade , where his gracious and imperial majesty was accustomed to display himself to his subjects . ( The roadway is overgrown with clumps of grass , and in the en trance hall under the portico are packing boxes where food was lately handed to a breadline . But of that no matter , ) It was the last project of a reign devoted almost entirely to building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This pink faced old man with the kindly sidewhiskers razed the walls of the inner city , erected showy palaces , baroque theatres , Grecian parliament buildings , Gothic cathedrals , museums and innumerable fountains . He had a touch of the Roman passion for aqueducts , and deflected the course of the Danube . He employed whole schools of sculptors , who filled the roofs of the city with athletes , centaurs , muses and victorious four ' , steeded chariots . He supplied the public squares with horse-trainers , generals and symbolic figures representing the four rivers of Austria . He made Vienna the third capital in Europe . And yet , 0 Francis Joseph , Caesar and heir of all the tyrannies of the Hapsburgs , was it for the glory of Vienna that you spent so many taxes and put to labor so many men , or for the easement of your own heart ? Your Empress was assassinated and your son died a not very noble death , alone . The Emperor Maximilian could not stand long against the Mexican wall after the bullets of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ly enough , murdered at Sarajevo . Augustus Caesar found Rome a city of brick and left it marble ; and his daughter Julia committed adultery with a provincial . John J. McNulty in a new straw hat and a slick business suit stands outside the Grand Hotel and orders a taxi . His bullneck grows thicker and his , pink hair bristles and the sidewalk is astonished . Mr. McNulty prides himself that he can go anY ' where in Europe and get anything he wants by shouting loudly enough and tipping lavishly enough . And why should he not shout loudly -- 15 not man above all the other vertebrates ? And whY should he not tip lavishly ? did he not this morn ' ing receive 53,000 kronen for every one of his good American dollars ? He has just lunched on pate de foie gras , filet de boeuf Bordelaise , polo ' Ines frites , savarin and Emmentaler ; his bill , including a bottle of Ch ? teau Palugyay , coffee and a Cognac , amounted almost to two dollars . Now he would like a taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonished . In a not unfashionable ' street just beyond the Inner Stadt ; lives a colonel Of the late Imperial Army with his wife , his mother and his two small sons . They are now obliged to rent their available rooms , even to the former dining room , to passing foreigners . They employ one maid . Gretel is thirty-three ; already she begins to call herself old ; yet she will laugh or weep on the slightest provocation , like a child . Once an American lady offered to pay her passage to New York , but she could not well leave her mother who , at seventy-two , can not hope much longer to support herself by washing clothes . Gretel 's most luxurious memory is ' of a year spent in a public hospital ; nothing pleases her more than to find someone to whom she can show her wound , counting the stitches . She rises at five , shines eighteen pairs of shoes , pre-Pares the breakfasts of the guests , makes the beds and cleans the rooms , chops the wood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cooking . For this she receives 20,000 kronen a month . When her last red apron wore out , she could not ' afford a new one . Lest she lose caste , for it is essential that aprons shall be red , she bought a white one and dyed it . The pound of sugar which she bought yesterday for her mother cost 31,000 kronen . At night she sleeps on a cot in a room too poor to let even to the most impecunious guest . The orchestra in the Pavilion begins a waltz of StrauSs 's . The peasant girl with the crimson square over her gay flowered dress regards the exquisite with amorous slyness . The two American undergraduates , who came to Vienna seeking a. cheaper Paris , absorb the table next to the elegant young Egyptian with the swart and pustular face . The sunlight turns the gendarme 's sword to the thinnest of rapiers ; the scarlet tabs of his collar add to the shoddiness of his uniform . On the gravel , walk beyond the circle of tables , stand a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music . The woman 's face has the vacuity of despair ; the countenance of the man suffers stolidly , hopelessly , uncomprehendingly ; the child 's look has grown petulant with continued denials . Their expressions do not alter , nor do their eyes move , as they stand listening to the pretty music , sweet and gay as a colored ice , faintly stirring as the cream-coated coffee , light as the shadow of a cloud .
