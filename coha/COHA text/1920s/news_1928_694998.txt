txt My companions , Captain Koehl and Baron von Huenefeld , and myself are here tonight , but not in the Bremen , as we had hoped . The Junkers plane in which we hopped the pond is on the mainland at Long Point , Quebec , but we are still optimistic . of having her repaired . We wish to fly her back to Ireland within ten days and , after fueling , to go on to Germany . Of course we are keenly disappointed not to be here in our own machine . We did our best to get her in the air again , but met with no success . Then , learning last night of the death of Floyd Bennett , we decided to leave the Bremen behind and fly to Washington to place a wreath upon his grave . Return to Greenely Described . My return journey to Greenely Island to rejoin my comrades there was not altogether uneventful . I came out , it will be recalled , to get the parts with which , we felt , the Bremen could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane that was sent to our relief . This was the plane chartered by The New York World and North American Newspaper Alliance in flying which toward Greenely Island , Floyd Bennett contracted the pneumonia which caused his death . We left Lake Ste. Agnes expecting to stop at Seven Islands , Quebec , and after fueling to hop off at once for Greenely , ar- ' riving there that afternoon . But luck was against us , for the petrol we expected at Seven Islands was not there . Press planes had used it up , and the nearest supply was at the village . Two hours passed before we got it . In the meantime the sun had been melting the snow badly and we were in doubt that we could get off . Nevertheless , we tried it . Twice we ran over the snow for two miles , but we could not get in the air . So we gave it up and decided to spend the night there , hoping for a frost to harden the surface for us . Found Bremen All Ready for Repairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the local people . They were very nice to us . The next morning at . 6 o'clock we started the engine , and this time were successful in taking off . We reached Greenely without any other incident . I was surprised upon returning to find that the Bremen had been moved . She was not in the reservoir where she broke through the ice when we landed on it after our trip across from Ireland . Dr. Louis Cuisinier , the technical director of the Canadian Transcontinental Airways , and Koehl had done a remarkable feat of engineering and had hoisted her up on the embankment . They had also drained the water from the reservoir . The machine stood propped up , the damaged propeller taken off , and her undercarriage removed . All was in readiness for the work of repair . Koeppen Started Without Eating . Ernest Koeppen , the Junkers mechanic , wasted no time in getting to work . He did not wait to have anything to eat , but started in to straighten out the propeller . In a previous article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lighthouse on Greenely , and it was here that Koeppen hammered out the " prop . " Then , bolting it on the shaft again , he started to put on the new undercarriage we had brought along . The original intention to try to take off from the reservoir had been abandoned . The ice in the bay was better , and without skis we knew we would need a long run . But the Bremen stood at the top of a very steep gradient , and now that she was repaired we would have to get her down . It was manifestly impossible to ease the Bremen down on her : ' : heels . We were certain to do her irreparable damage . We decided to use clog sleds , and , putting one under each wheel , we began the task of moving her gently to the ice in the bay below . It was no easy task . It took us three hours to do it . Bremen Breaks Through the Ice . With the machine safely on the ice in the bay , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That evening we held a consultation and agreed that the best place for a take-off would be from the ice off Long Point on the mainland , about a mile away . We had placed a native as guard over the ship during the nigh L. Next morning conditions were extremely good . We turned out at 5 o'clock . and began to push the Bremen across the ice . Three times , however , she broke through soft spots in the ice and we had to hoist her up again and place her on dog sleds . Then we started pushing her once more , this time successfully , finally reaching the smooth ice running parallel with the shore line . We now decided to build a fire and warm the oil and try to warm the engine . A large vessel was procured for boiling water . We also heated the tins of oil for the engine . Engine Refuses to Start . We tool : out the spark plugs and cleaned them thoroughly . They had become badly fouled in the flight . We also cleaned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned them , too . After that the petrol was filled in . At 8 o'clock in the morning we were ready to start the engine . We tried , but without success . She popped a few times , but she would not take hold . This was due to the fact that the engine has a very high compression , a ratio of seven , and we could not get compression except on two of the cylinders . We came to the conclusion that the grease we put on the valves aft-er we broke through the ice on Greenely had melted Ohl the Niztrill clays and had trickled down the valve stems , running into the ports . Later this hardened , thus preventing the valves f  --  em heating properly except on the two cylinders mentioned . We worked a whole day on this , even using blow lamps in an effort to clear the valves , but with no success . Optimism Near Vanishing Point . That evening there was every indication of an approaching gale . We decided to move the Bremen off the ice into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we covered her up against the storm we knew would come . We were not mistaken . It began to snow before we had completed this work . Then a gale came up , and further work that night was impossible . Much of our optimism had left us now . When the repair parts came we e ? petted to install them quickly and take off without further delay . Now we decided to hold a conference . Its outcome I have already told . We were no longer in our quarters on Greenely Island , but were inetalled on the mainland . The Baron and Koehl had been put up in the home of the telegraph operator there , and I had been taken to the house of the parish priest . We messed together , however , at the house of the operator , and it was there we conferred that night . Tel s Sorrow at Bennett 's Death . I should like to say a word here about Floyd Bennett . I qwq Agnes when the plane was being loaded with repair pars for the Bremen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island . had never met him before he came to Lake Ste. Agnes with the relief plane . I had no idea when I left here that he was so ill . His death was a shock to me . Aviation miss him . He did much for it . His loss is inestimably great . The news depressed us greatly . Until then the three of us had been overjoyed to be reunited . When I left Greenely I expected to be gone for not more than two days ; but my stay was an enforced one and my comrades showed every pleasure I at my return . I brought them many things they needed . They had been without luxuries of any kind , and almost without necessary clothing . I brought back cigars and nice things to eat , and clean underwear and shirts to wear . That first night together in the lighthouse Monday we had almost a feast . We hoped to be off in the morning . We felt certain of taking the Bremen into the air again . So we had quite a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with cigars and cigarettes . We enjoyed it immensely . Flight Bach to Lake Ste. Agnes . We Went to bed planning to get up at dawn today . The weather indications were fair , but when we arose conditions were bad . We decided not to delay , however , and we took off at 8:45 Atlantic Time , or 7:45 Eastern Standard Time , this morning in the Ford plane , leaving the Bremen behind . We encountered snow at the start of our flight back . For 100 miles the going was bad . It was exceedingly bumpy in the air and we had a head wind which slowed us up . Balchen and I took the controls for the first three hours . Then Balchen and Kochi flew the next three hours . After the first two hours the weather cleared . Then we ran into bright sunshine and excellent visibility . We began to make better speed too . We passed Godbout , Quebec , at 2 o'clock and Mille Vaches , Quebec , at 3 o'clock . About threequarters of an hour later we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for us on the ice . We landed at 3:52 . Plan Washington Hop at Dawn . Mr. Couture and iklr . Cannon of the Airways Company and Mme. Cuisinier , whose guest I had been before , any Miss Junkers came to meet us . To me the scene was familiar , but to my comrades it was strange and the faces were new . We were soon made at home , however . We are to spend the evening in Murray Bay . The accommodations at the Airways base are limited , and a house has been placed at our disposal in the village . I am looking forward to a fine hot tub . We plan to take off at dawn and make a non-stop flight LO Washington . There we will pay our little tribute to Bennett . Then on Saturday morning we will fly on to New York .
