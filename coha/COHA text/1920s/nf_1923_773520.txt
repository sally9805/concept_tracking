txt // dressing the Babe neatly . Now Father , look once upon your Child ! 0 pretty thing ! 0 sweet-fac 'd dainty darling ! ' t is Father 's own picture ! Well what would not one undergo to be the Mother of so fine an Angel ! And who can or dare doubt any thing of it , for the Mother loves it , and the Father beleeves it , nay and all the friends that come tumbling in one upon another to-day , do confirm it : For behold , every one looks earnestly at the Babe ; and doth not a little commend his prettiness . One saith it is as like the Father ( alias Daddy ) as one drop of Water is like another . Another , that the upper part of the face , forehead , eys and nose incline very much to be like the mother ; but downwards it is every bit the Father . And who forsooth should not beleeve it , if it be a , son . Every one is in an admiration . 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have drest it up most curiously ! And truly there 's no cost spar 'd for the having very rich laces . Thus they ly and tamper upon this first string , till the Child-bed woman begins to enter upon the relating what great pain in travell she had to fetch this Child out of the Parsly-bed , what a difference there was between her , and others of her acquaintance , &c.; Thereout every one hath so much matter , as would make a longwinded sermon ; and the conclusion generally is the relating how and when the good man crept to bed to her again ; and how such a one Of Marriage I o I one had been a fortnight with Child , before she went to receive her churching . Where upon another comes with a full-mouth 'd confession , that her husband was not half so hot . Do but tarry a little yet , till the Gossippingbowl hath gone once or twice more about with old Hock ; then you'l hear these Parrots tell you other sorts of tales . In the mean while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he rejoyces , that his wife is so reasonable strong again ; and that she is so neatly trickt up sitting in state in the best furnished room , by the bed-side ! 0 what a pleasure this is ! 0 how he treats all the women with delicate Marget Ale , and Sack and Sugar ! unless he begin to bethink himself , and for respects sake or frugality , sets some bottles aside ; because he perceives it to be nothing else but a vast expence and womens Apish tricks . How busie he is in carving for them of his Roast-beef , Capons , Turkey-py , Neats-tongue , or some other savoury bit to make their mouths relish their liquor the better ; and then stand fast Bowls and glasses for they resolve not to flinch from it . And indeed why should he not ? for he is now a whole estate richer then he was before ; and what need he care for it then . Well behold here ! Now the womens mouths are a beginning to be first a little warm ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should speak of their own Commodities . // 0 how happy would you be , 0 Goodman Cully , if you had but as many ears as Argils had eys , that you might hear every where , whilest you are carving and serving of them , what pretty sweet stories and discourses , these sorts of Parrats will be talking of ? For Mistris Sharp-set relates , what a pleasure she oft times received in it , to keep School-time with her husband at noons , as soon as they had feasted their carkasses well : but that conning of her lesson had caused her severall times to make a journy to the Parsly-bed . At this Mistris Sincere wonders extreamly ; saying how strangely these things happen to one woman more then another . In our Parish there is a married woman brought to bed , but she was so miserably handled by the Midwife , that no tongue can express it . Insomuch that Master Peepin the Man Midwife , was fain to be fetcht , to assist with his Instrument ; it was a very great wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamentable indeed to be related ; and too sad indeed to be placed by me among the Pleasures of Marriage . In the mean time , at the t' other end of the Chamber , Mistris Fairtail relates a pretty story how their Maid was very curiously stitcht up by their Tailor ; and how she was every foot running thither , then to have a hole finely drawn that she had torn in her Petti-coat , another while to have her Bodice made a little wider , and then again to have her stockins soled . It // It is no wonder , ( saith Mistres Paleface ) that this should happen to a poor innocent servant Maid ; there was my husbands first wives niece Mrs. Young-rose that modest Virgin , she kept such a close conversation &; daily communication with Master Scure , that at last there appeared a little Cupid with little ears , and short hair . Nay then ( saith Mistris Lookabout ) those two sisters need not twit one another in the teeth with it ; for the t' other kept such a sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner-house , where she did eat so many China Oranges , and other watrish fruits , that they caused her to get an extraordinary swelling under her stomack ; which Doctor Stultus judged to proceed from some obstructions , wind , and other watrish humours ; but it did not continue so long before her Mother , beginning better to apprehend the nature of her distemper , sent her away to her Country-house at Hackney . Mistris Lookabout was going to begin again ; but they heard such rapping and knocking at the dore , that one of them said I beleeve there are our husbands ; and indeed she guest very well . This augmented their mirth mightily . And especially of the Nurse ; for now she was sure that , if the good Cully her Master treated his Gossips nobly and liberally , her presents would be doubled . But Nurse do not cheat your self , for fear it might happen otherwise ; I know once a merry boon Companion , who being at 1 04 The Ten Pleasures at a Gossipping Feast , called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nurse , I ' 1 swear you are very vigilant and take a great deal of pains , in serving both us and our wives with all things , and also filling of us full glasses and bowls : hark hither , my wife is a little covetous , and oft-times so narrow- soul 'd that she doth not keep her credit where she ought to do , so that I beleeve her gift will not be very great , and truly because you are such a good body , see there , that 's for you , put it some where privately away ; &; there-with thrusts her an indifferent great brass Counter , wrapt up in a paper , into her hand . The Nurse certainly beleeving this to be at the least a Crown piece , thanks him very demurely , and puts it in her Pocket ; never opening it till they were every one of them gone , but then she saw that she was basely cheated . But Nurse you are warned now by this , another time you may look better to't . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good man of the house his wine ; and when the Wine begins to surge crown-high ; the men are much more generous than before . And verily methinks I have a mind to take my portion of it also ; but yet not so as the Nurse did at my Neeces , who had toss 'd up her bowls so bravely upon the good health of the Childbed woman her Mistriss , that when she was going to swathe and feed the Child , instead of putting the spoon into the mouth , she thrust it under // under the chin , &; sometimes against the breast ; and then when she was about swathing of it ; as it is commonly the custom to lay a wollen blanket and linnen bed together , she wrapt the poor Infant with its little naked body only in the blanket alone . 0 thrice happy young Father , who have hitherto so nobly treated and entertained all your She Gossips , and had the audience of all their curious relations ! Now you will have the honour also of entertaining their husbands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you reason out of the greatest bowl you will set before them , and talk as freely of a Py-corner merchandize . Who is there now that doth not praise , and commend your manfull deeds to the highest ? Ha , ha , saith Master Laugh wel , that 's a Child ! who ever saw a braver ! there 's not the fellow o n't ! 0 my dearest , I have such a delight in this Child , that if we were but a little alone together , I 'd cast you such another as if it were of the same mould . Stay a little , stay a little , saith Master Fillup , it may be you would not run so strong a course . Yet I saw once two Souldiers who were Batchelors , that were sitting in an evening drinking in an Alehouse , and talking lustily of the Bobbinjo trade ; whereupon one of them said ; Cocksbobs yack if I had but a Wife , as well as another , I 'd presently get her with Child of a brave boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o6 The Ten Pleasures t' other , it is an easie thing to get a Wife if one seek it . If I would , I dare lay a wager o n't , I would be the Bridegroom within the space of two hours . The other not beleeving him , they laid a wager between them for a bottle of Wine . Hereupon one of them went out of dores just upon the striking of the clock ; &; hardly was gone a streets length , before he met with a bonny bouncing girl , who was going of an errand for her Mistris , and he presently laies her on board . But she seemed to be very much offended , that an honest Maid going about her business in the evening , should be in this manner so encountred by a strange fellow , with a sword by his side . Verily , Sweetheart , said he , you have a great deal of reason in all what you say ; but you may certainly beleeve that it is an honest person who speaks to you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good condition 'd Maid . My wearing of a sword , is because I am a Souldier , and am very well known by many honest people . And truly , if you please to admit me this favour , you shall see and find me to be an honest man , and none of those that go about to ly and deceive any body ; and indeed my intention &; desire is to marry , to that end seeking nothing but an honest Maid , and I doubt not but that I have at this time found one to my mind . And went forward with his chat in these sort of terms . But the Maid denied him , saying , that she had no // no mind at-all to a Souldier , because it was one of the poorest and miserablest sort of levelihoods ; their pay being but very little , and they were seldom advanced , &c.; He on the other side commending &; approving a Souldiers life to be the merriest , resolutest , &; absolute easiest of any that was under the Sun ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any waies take place by them , but that they , on the contrary , were alwaies merry , never admitting sorrow into their thoughts . ' T is true , said he , our pay is but stnall ; but then again , all what the Country people have , is our own ; for what we want our selves , we get from them : we never take care for to morrow , having alwaies something fresh , and every day new mirth . Riches , Sweetheart , doth not consist in multiplicity of Goods , but in content ; &; there 's no one better satisfied than a Souldier , therefore you shall alwaies see an honest Souldier look plump and fat , just as I do : but Drunkards and Whoremasters fall away miserably , &c.; In short , the Maid begun a little to listen to him ( and so much the more , because that very morning she had a falling out with her Mistris ) and told him , she would take it into consideration . He answered her again , what a fidle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are equally matcht : a Souldier never thinks long upon any thing , but takes hold of all present opportunities , and it generally falls out well with r o 8 T'Ae Ten Pleasures with him . But she drawing back a little , he saith , ah my dearest , you must take a quick resolution . Behold there , yonder comes a Cloud driving towards the Moon : I ' 1 give you so much time , till that be past by ; therefore be pleased to resolve quick , for otherwise I must go &; seek my fortune by another . For a Soldier neither woos nor threatens long . Upon this she considered a little , but before the Cloud was past by the Moon , she gave him her consent ; and he gave her his Tobacco-box for a pledge of marriage ; and desired something of her in like manner for a pledge ; but she said she had nothing : howsoever he persisted so strongly , that in conclusion she gave him her Garter for a pledge of marriage . He was contented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Comrades ; and told them what had hapned to him , shewing them the Garter . Whereupon he that had laid the wager with him , askt , who it was , what her name was , and where she dwelt , &c.; And being told by another , that it was a handsom , neat , and very well complexion 'd Maid , By my troth , said he , I wish I were to give four Cans of Wine that I could light upon such another . Well , see there , saith the first , if you will give four Cans of Wine , I will both give you the Garter &; the Maid too into the bargain : It was done but by Moonlight ; so that she'l hardly know whether it be me or another . Hereupon Of Marriage 1 09 Hereupon the agreement was concluded , the two first Cans of Wine were spent , and the Garter was delivered to him , and every one charged to keep it secret . This second Souldier goes to the Maid next day in the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet . And there relating to her several passages that were passed between them the day before , and shewing her the Garter , made her beleeve that he was the person that had contracted with her the day before . To be short , the Maid leaves her service and marries him . And that which is most to be observed , is , that that which the first Souldier vaunted to have done , the second performed ; for just nine months after they were married , she was brought to bed of a gallant young boy , and they lived very peaceably and quietly together . Well , I ' 1 vow , saith Master Crossgrain , that 's a very notable relation ; it is better a great deal that the business happen so , then like another , which is just contrary , that I shall make mention of to you . Barebeard and Mally , who by a sudden accident , without much wooing , were gotten together , and their first Bane of matrimony was published ; but falling out , they called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nay it run so high , that they would discharge each other of their promises , and resolved to go to the Bishop &; crave that they might r r o The Ten Pleasures might have liberty to forbid the Banes themselves , which hapned so . Barebeard coming then with Mall before his Grace , complained that he did already perceive his intended marriage would never come to a good event , because he found perfectly that this Maid was a lumpish Jade , a nasty Slut , a Scolding , bawling Carrion , &; a restless peece of mortality . Therefore it might go as it would , he did not care for the Maid , neither would he marry her , and for those reasons , he desired his Grace to grant that the Banes might be forbidden ; as thinking it much better for him to quit her betimes , before it was too late . She on the t' other side said , that he was one that run gadding along the streets at all hours of the night , a private drunken beast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him neither . Whereupon his Grace smiling told them , well you fellow and wench ; do you think that we do here so give and take away the consent of marriage ? perhaps when you are married , it may be much better , for the marriage bed doth for the most part change the ten sences into five . But she answered , may it please your Grace , he is no such man to do that , for all that he can do is only to follow his own round-head-like stiffneckedness , and e'en nothing else . Whereupon he again answered , may it please your Grace , I have no mind ever to try it with such a creature as she is ; I should be then fast enough bound to her Of Marriage r r I her ; neither would I willingly go alive headlong to the Devil , to take my habitation in Hell . The Bishop thus perceiving that no good thread could be spun of such sort of Flax , caused the Banes to be forbidden . Then said Barebeard , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &; may I not marry with whom I please , or have a mind to ? to which his Grace answered , yes . Presently Barebeard thrusting his head out at the dore , calls out aloud , Peg do you come hither now ; and begged that his Grace would be pleased to give him leave to marry with this person . Which Mall seeing she cries out , you Rogue , you have been too cunning for me in this ; if I had the least thoughts o n't , I would have had my Hal to have tarried for me at this dore , instead of tarrying for me at another place . Whereupon his Grace , being in great ire , chid them most shrewdly , giving them such strong reproofs , that at first it might very well be imagined that he would never have admitted of a second consent ; yet afterwards upon considerations it was granted . But Barebeard being now married with Peg , they got no children : And Mall being married to Hal , they had both a Son and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be observed what acquaintance Mall had made with Barebeard before hand , &; why she would rather marry with Hall then with him . To this again Mistris Sweetmouth relates , that she I I 2 The Ten Pleasures she had been several times invited to Mistris Braves labour ; and that she had been twice brought to bed very happily of two delicate twins . And in the last encounter , for a recompence of the affection of her Beloved , she presented him with two lustly and gallant boys ; but because she would equally balance his great bounty ; the Midwife takes the same walk again for another , and finding in what condition things stood , she calls for a bason of warm water , bringing out at last a most delicate pretty daughter , that was yet poor thing wrapt up in the Cawl . Which she immediately laid into the warm water , and shewed unto them all the wonderfull works of nature ; for there they could see it move and stir , as if it had been in its Mothers glass Bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small hole , it begun presently to make a little noise like a weak childish voice , which indeed was very rare &; pleasant to be seen . In truth , such a Father , who can cast every time such high doubblets , may very well be called by the name of Brave . But this Story was hardly told before Mistris Tittle-tattle pursued it with another out of the same Text , saying , A little more then two years ago I was at a Gossipping by Mistris Gay , whowas then brought to bed both of a Son and a Daughter , also at one birth ; but indeed the Labour came so violently upon her , that as she was standing upon the stairs , not being able to set Of Marriage set one foot further ; and having neither Midwife , nor any other women of her neighbors and friends , only the assistance of her husband and the Maid ; she was immediately delivered of two gallant Children ; but they did not live long . Upon my word , said Mistris Bounce-about , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such sort of roads . It hapned to me once that some Gentlewomen were merry with me somewhat late in the evening ; and because I had had several Symptoms of Labour , said this , Mistris Bounce-about , if you would now take a walk to the Parsley bed , we would help you very bravely ; but neither wind nor weather was serviceable at that time . But they had hardly been gone an hour , and being in bed with my husband , and he very fast asleep ; before there begun such an alteration of the weather ; that my husband must up with all speed , who wakened the Maid , and sent her for the Midwife laying on fire himself in all hast ; yet do all what they could , within less then a quarter of an hour , and that without any bodies help but my husbands , my journy was performed ; but things were done with such a confusion ; that he received the child in the Christning cloath instead of the Blanket . And a thousand more such stories as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongest memory to bear them : and so much the more , because it is impossible to distinguish one from the II z 14 The Ten Pleasures the t' other , when the men and the women that gabble so one among another . And oft-times they spin such course threads of bawdery in their talk , that are enough to spoil a whole web of linnen . And who can tell but that their tattling would last a whole night , for there 's hardly one of them who hath not at the least a hundred in their Budgets ; but because it is high time that either the Dry or Wet-Nurse must go to swathe the child , they begin to break off and shorten their prittle-prattle . Now young Father , do but observe what fine airy complements will be presented to you at their parting . Every one thanks you for your kind and cordial entertainment , and not one of them forgets to wish that you may the next year either have a Daughter to your Son , or a Son to your Daughter ; imagining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a full crop : But I am most apt to beleeve that all their wishes aim at the But of coming next year again to the Gossips Feast , to toss up the Gossips-bowl , and in telling of a bobbinjo story they peep into all nooks and corners . Well , 0 new Father , this Pleasure begins to come to a conclusion ; but prithee tell me , would not a body wish for the getting of such another , that his Wife might make a journy to the Parsly-bed twice a year ? Now Nurse have at you ; you shall now reap the fruit of all your running and going early &; late Of Marriage I I 5 late to invite them . Oh thinks she by her self , would but every shilling change it self into a crown-peece . But Nurse you ' ! hardly be troubled with a fit of that yellow Jaundies sickness , for there 's no drug at the Apothecaries , nor any lice among the Beggars that can cure you of it . And I dare say Nurse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard time , and mony mighty scarce : because formerly the women used to put their hands more liberally in their purses , and one gave a crown , another half a crown ; but the times are now so strangely altered , that they keep little mild-shillings only for that use , nay some of them rub it off with a couple of their Grandams gray groats . But howsoever I hope for your sake , it will not be here according as often happens , fair promises but no performances ; for if it should , I protest ye ought to have made your bargain to have had a peece more at the least for your Nurse keeping ; or otherwise you must have had the full liberty to toss up the remains of all that was left in the Gossipping Bowls , or else to have carried the key of the Wine Cellar alwaies in your pocket , and then after the feeding and swathing the child , you might in the twinkling of an eye , swinge up a lustly glass upon the good health of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wine was laid in to be made use of to that end and purpose ; and it is commonly known that the Nurses are not so mealy r r 6 The Ten Pleasures mealy mouth 'd ; for although they do n't do it that every one should see it , they'l be sure with the Maid to get their shares in one corner or other . But you must for this again think , that the freer you let them take their swing herein , the more care they will take for the Child . Now Nurse , do n't spare to make good use of your time , for it belongs amongst other things to this Pleasure ; and the new Father will nevertheless be turning about to another mirth , and then you may be sure to expect to have a God be w'ye . Therefore make much of your self , and toss up your glasses stoutly at the Wine-Cask ; who knows whether you may have the opportunity this twelve month again to meet with such a good Nurse-keeping ; a liquorish sweettooth 'd Child-bed woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you may certainly beleeve , that the month will be no sooner ended , then that you'l begin to stink here ; for the Mistris will begin to consider with her self , that she can make a shift with the Maid and Wet-Nurse ; so that then you must expect to get your undesired Pass . Then you must return back again to your own lodging , that dark , moist and mournfull Cell , and satisfie your self , if you can get it , with a mess of milk and brown George , or some such sort of lean fare . So that you'l have time enough to wast away that fulsomness and fogginess of body , that you have gotten in . your Nursekeeping Of Marriage i i 7 keeping . For there 's no body that will give you any thing , or thinks in the least upon your attendance , unless they want you again . O new Father , pray for it to come again within a twelve month , that you may have a renewing of this pleasure once more ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will conduct you to a following . THE // THE TENTH PLEASURE . A great Child-bed Feast is kept , and the Child put in Cloaths . OH how pleasant is th'estate of married people , above that of Batchelors and Maids ? how it distributes Mirths and Pleasures ! Verily one may in some measure recogitate or write something of it , but it is impossible to imprint so Sun-like a splendor in Potters clay , or to display it with the most curious Colours . Though the accomplishedst Painter might have drawn it very near the life , yet it would be but a dead draught , in comparison of the reality and experience that is found in it self . You have already seen here nine Parts or Tables but it is not ninety Pictures that can sufficiently shew you the fulness of one of the nine Parts . Be therefore chearfully merry , 0 sweet Couple , because you are in so short a time arisen to the height of being possessors of all these Pleasures : And so much the more , the ninth ' being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the tenth follows , as it were treading upon the heels of the t' other . They have scarce wiped their mouths or digested the Child-bed Wine in their stomacks , before there starts up a new day of mirth &; jollity ; for now there must be a Child-bed feast kept &; the child must be put in Cloaths. 0 what two vast Pleasures are these for the young Father ! ' t is indeed too much joy for one person alone to be possessor of . At first you had the Pleasure for to treat the ' Women , those pretty pleasing Creatures , and to hear all their sweet and amiable discourses . But now you shall be honoured with treating the Matron like Midwife , and those Men and Women that are your kindest friends and nearest relations ; Yea and the God-Fathers and God-Mothers also who will all of them accompany you with courteous discourses and pleasant countenances : They will begin a lusty Bowl or thumping glass , super naculum drink it out , upon the health &; prosperity of you , your Bedfellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may increase and multiply , at least every year with one new Babe ; because that they then might the better come to the Child-bed Feast . Here you'l see now how smartly they'l both lick your dishes , and toss your Cups and Glasses off . Begin you only some good healths , as ; pray God bless his Majesty and all the Royal Family : the Prosperity of our Native Country ; all // all the Well wishers of the Cities welfare , &c.; And when you have done , they'l begin ; and about it goes to invest you with the honour and name , in a full bowl to the Father of the Family ; Well is not that a noble title ; such a Pleasure alone is worth a thousand pounds at lest . And whilest the Men are busie this way ; the good woman with the other Women are contriving on the other side how the Child ought to be put in Cloaths upon the best and modishest manner : For she is resolved to morrow morning to be Church 'd , &; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first well enough , but is at a damnable doubt in the second part of her resolution ; for by the way , in the Church , and in the streets , she hath continually observed severall children , and the most part of them dressed up in severall sorts of fashions : Some of them she hath a great fancy for , but then she doubts whether that be the newest mode or not . One seems too plain and common , which makes her imagine in her thoughts ; that 's too Clownish . But others stand very neat and handsom . ' T is true , the Stuf and the Lining is costly and very dear ; but then again it is very comly and handsom . And then again she thinks with her self , as long as I am at Market , I 'd as good go through stirch with it ; and make but one paying for all ; it is for our first , and but for a little child , not for a great person ; therefore it is Of Marriage I 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat , the price for making is all one ; besides it will be a great Pleasure for my husband when he sees how delicately the child is drest up , and his mony so extraordinarily well husbanded . Now , my dearest , pray be you merry : if the stuf hath cost somthing much , you have need but of little ; and it is for your first . When it grows bigger , or that you get more , you must part with much more mony . Do n't grudge at this for once , because then you would spoil all your mirth and Pleasure with it . Rejoice that you have a Wife , who is not only good to fetch children out of the Parsley Bed ; but is also very carefull to see them well nourished , and neat and cleanly cloath 'd . You your self have the praise and commendation of it . Let her alone a while , for women must have their wills ; say but little to her , for her brains are too much busied already ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly get three words of answer from her ; and suppose you should relate somthing or other to her , this shall be your answer from her at last , that she did not well understand you , because all her thoughts , nay . her very sences do as it were glide to &; again , one among another continually , to order the dressing up of her child . I am very well assured , 0 new invested Husband , that your wits at present run a Woolgathering , because that both Merchandize and Trade I 2 0 The Ten Pleasures all the Well wishers of the Cities welfare , &c.; And when you have done , they'l begin ; and about it goes to invest you with the honour and name , in a full bowl to the Father of the Family ; Well is not that a noble title ; such a Pleasure alone is worth a thousand pounds at lest . And whilest the Men are busie this way ; the good woman with the other Women are contriving on the other side how the Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modishest manner : For she is resolved to morrow morning to be Church 'd , &; in the afternoon she'l go to market . She accomplishes the first well enough , but is at a damnable doubt in the second part of her resolution ; for by the way , in the Church , and in the streets , she hath continually observed severall children , and the most part of them dressed up in severall sorts of fashions : Some of them she bath a great fancy for , but then she doubts whether that be the newest mode or not . One seems too plain and common , which makes her imagine in her thoughts ; that 's too Clownish . But others stand very neat and handsom . ' T is true , the Stuf and the Lining is costly and very dear ; but then again it is very comly and handsom . And then again she thinks with her self , as long as I am at Market , I 'd as good go through stirch with it ; and make but one paying for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little child , not for a great person ; therefore it Is Of Marriage I 2 I is better to take that which is curious and neat , the price for making is all one ; besides it will be a great Pleasure for my husband when he sees how delicately the child is drest up , and his mony so extraordinarily well husbanded . Now , my dearest , pray be you merry : if the stuf hath cost somthing much , you have need but of little ; and it is for your first . When it grows bigger , or that you get more , you must part with much more mony . Do n't grudge at this for once , because then you would spoil all your mirth and Pleasure with it . Rejoice that you have a Wife , who is not only good to fetch children out of the Parsley Bed ; but is also very carefull to see them well nourished , and neat and cleanly cloath 'd . You your self have the praise and commendation of it . Let her alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say but little to her , for her brains are too much busied already ; and it may be that in three hours time , you would hardly get three words of answer from her ; and suppose you should relate somthing or other to her , this shall be your answer from her at last , that she did not well understand you , because all her thoughts , nay , her very sences do as it were glide to &; again , one among another continually , to order the dressing up of her child . I am very well assured , 0 new invested Husband , that your wits at present run a Woolgathering , because that both Merchandize and Trade 12 2 The Ten Pleasures Trade are neither of them so quick as you would fain see them ; and by reason of this tedious and destructive War , monies is horrible scarce , nothing near so plentifull as you could wish it to be : But comfort your self herewith , that it bath hapned oft-times to others , &; will yet also happen oftner to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but stay a little , to morrow or next day the Nurse goes away . This seems to be a merriment indeed ; for then you'l have an Eater , a Stroy-good , a Stuf-gut , a Spoil-all , and Prittle-pratler , less than you had before . You are yet so happy that you have a WetNurse , that carefully looks after the Child ; by which means both you and your Wife are freed from tossing and tumbling with it in the night : whilest others , on the contrary , that have no Wet-Nurses in their houses ; begin first to tast , when the Dry-Nurse goes away , what a Pleasure it is that the Child must be set by the Bedside , and the charge thereof left unto both Father &; Mother , when it oftentimes happens that the good woman is yet so weak , she can neither lay the Child in , nor take it out of the Cradle ; insomuch that the Father here must put a helping hand to't , because he is of a stronger constitution , and hath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those are they who have the first and true tast of the Kernel of the TenthPleasure ; because the husband ought as then , out Of Marriage z 2 3 out of a tender affection for his wife to rock continually , that she might take her rest ; otherwise she would not get any suck in her breasts for the Child : And happy they are somtimes , if they come off with but rocking the most part of the night ; for many times it happens , that the Child is so restless and unquiet , that Father , Mother , &; Maid ; nay and all whatsoever is in the house must out of their beds to quiet it ; and though they use a thousand tricks and stratagems , yet all 's to no purpose . And yet this is but a small matter for them neither ; for before a few months are past , the child begins to get teeth ; and bawls and cries so night &; day , that they can tell the clock all the night long ; wishing a thousand thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the comfortable assistance of day-light receive a little solace for all their toiling and tumbling too and again . Yet I would advise such as these , that they must in no manner be discomforted at this ; if they intend to demonstrate that they have learnt somthing in the School of Marriage , to exercise their patiences : But , on the contrary , to shew themselves contented with all things ; being assured , that hereafter when all this trouble is past , they shall receive the happiness , that the child will return them thanks with its pretty smiles ; and in time also will salute them with a slabbering cocurring . And I beleeve now that they // they clearly find that all things do not go so even in this World , as they well imagined : And that the fairest Sunshine of Marriage , may be somtimes darkned with a Cloudy Storm . You married people , that have the help of a Wet-Nurse , receive a much greater advantage in participating of the Pleasures of Marriage , neither need you to be troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 0 , young House-Father , this is a most incomparable Pleasure for you ! For now you may most certainly see the approach of a Daughter to your Son ; and by that means reap the possession again of all those former Pleasures ; &; by every one be saluted with the Title that you are an excellent good Artist . If it be so , be carefull that you do not gad up and down with your wife too much on horseback , or in Coaches ; for fear it might make her miscarry . But you have learnt all these things well enough at the first , and without doubt have kept them well in remembrance . Do but behold , in the mean time , what an unexpressible Pleasure your dearly Beloved hath in the tricking up of her sweet Baby in the most neatest dresses . What a World of pains she takes &; spends her spirits , to make the Tailor understand , according to what fashion she will have it made ; &; to hasten him that all things may be ready and totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Father , now open your eys ! Behold what a pretty Son you have ! How happy you are in so loving and understanding a Wife that knows how to trick it so curiously up in this manner ! She was never better pleased ! Undoubtedly the Summer nights are too long , and the daies too short for her to gad up and down traversing the streets of the City , that she may full. - fill her desire of shewing it to every body : never was any thing more neatly drest . But the Nurse and the Maid with the Child in the mean while at Jericho ; for their very backs and sides seem to be absolutely broken with carrying it up &; down from day to day . And most especially when the Child is wean 'd , and the Wet-Nurse turn 'd away , the Maid can not let it penetrate into her brain ; that she now not only the whole week must rock , sing , dandle , dress , and walk abroad with it ; but that she is upon Sundaies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a halter ; and never can stir out , as she formerly did , to walk abroad with Giles the Baker , or f ohn True the Tailor ; nor so much as go once to give a visit to her Country-folks or kindred ; which occasions no small difference between the Maid and the Mistriss . But good House Father , never trouble your self at it , for this belongs also to the Pleasures of Marriage ; nor do not seem discontented because your Dearest walks abroad thus every day ; but rather think with your self , she takes her spinning 12 6 The Ten Pleasures spinning Wheel and reel along with her . And if in her absence , you have not that due attendance , nor find that in the house and Kitchin things are not so well taken care for , why then , you must imagine to be satisfied with th'assistance of the Semstress , or some such sort of person , as well as you were when you enjoied the Eighth Pleasure : You must also observe , that if the Child should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the sweet Babe were ruined for ever . It is also too weak yet to be any waies roughly handled ; but it begins from day to day to grow stronger and stronger : Also with your Dearest carrying it abroad continually to visit all your friends and acquaintance , it learns by degrees to eat all things , and drinks not only Beer , but some Wine too . And I assure you it is no small Pleasure for the Father and Mother to see that this little young Gosling can so perfectly distinguish the tast of the Wine , from the tast of the Beer : tho when it is come to some elder years , perhaps they would give a hundred pound , if they could but wean it from it . But that 's too far to be lookt into . And care too soon taken makes people quickly grayheaded . Before you reach this length , yea perhaps before some few weeks are at an end ; you will see this sweet Babe afflicted with either the Measels or small Pox ; and then you'l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be disfigured Of Marriage I 2 7 disfigured with them , in having many pock-holes . And it is no wonder , for who knows whether he may be past small-pocking and measeling when he is five &; twenty years of age ? But on the contrary there may then perchance appear so many glimps of marriage Pleasures from him , that such small things will not be once lookt at . For if your Wife be now upon a new reckoning , and you come then , as I have told you before , to get a Daughter ; you will in time see what a pretty sweet Gentlewoman she'l grow to be ; how modestly &; orderly she goes to learn to write and read ; but most especially to prick samples ; which perhaps she'l be wholly perfect in , before she hath half learnt to sow : nay its probable that she'l be an Artist at the making of Bone-lace , though she was never taught it . Otherwise both you &; her Mother will reap an extraordinary Pleasure in seeing your Daughter grow up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she begins to study in the book of French manners and behaviours ; and knows also how to dress up her self so finically with all manner of trinkum trankums , that all the neighbouring young Gentlewomen , and your rich Neeces esteem themselves very much honoured with the injoiment of her company ; where they , following the examples of their Predecessors , do , by degrees , instruct one another in the newest fashions , finest Flanders Laces , the difference and richness of Stuffs , the neatest I 2 8 The Ten Pleasures neatest cut Gorgets , and many more such Iincombobs as these . Nay , and what 's more , they begin also to invite and treat each other like grave persons , according as the opportunity will allow them , first with some Cherries and Plums ; then with , some Filbuds and Small Nuts ; or Wallnuts &; Figs ; and afterwards with some Chesnuts and new Wine ; or to a game at Cards with a dish of Tee , or else to eat some Pancakes and Fritters or a Tansie ; nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good joint of meat &; a Sallad . Till at last it comes so far , that through these delicious conversations , they happen to get a Sweetheart , and in good time a bedfellow to keep them from slumbring and sleeping . And it is very pleasing to see that they do so observe the making good of the old Proverb , As old Birds did , the young ones sing , Which is a very pleasant thing . Happy are you , 0 you new Housholders , who have already possessed your selves of so many Pleasures in your marriage ; and are now come just to the very entrance to repossess your selves of them over again ; and perchance they 'll never depart from you as long as you see the one day follow the other . Be not backward or negligent in relating your happiness to others ; but if there be any distast or disaster that can happen in the married estate , lock it up in the very Closet of your heart , and abhor everlastingly the 0f Marriage I2 9 the thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pursue your footsteps , and be Listed into your Company , &; then also will your estate and condition be famous through the whole World . Conclusion . Thus long you have seen , Courteous Reader , how that those married people , who are but indifferently gifted with temporal means , indeavour to puff up each other with vain and airy hopes and imaginations , perswading themselves that all the troubles , vexations , and bondages of the married estate ; are nothing else but Mirths , Delights and Pleasures ; perhaps to no other end but to mitigate their own miserable condition , or else to draw others into the same unhappy snare ; as indeed oftentimes hapneth . But it is most sad and lamentable , that the meaner sort of people , when they have thrown themselves into it , make their condition a thousand times worse then it was before : For they , who at first could but very soberly and sparingly help themselves , do find when they are married , that they must go through not only ten , but at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitherto been said of the ten Pleasures , is only spoken of the good and most agreeable matches ; and not of any of those , which many times are so different and r 3 0 The Ten Pleasures and contrary of humour , as the light is from darkness ; where there is a continual Hell of dissention , cursing , mumbling and maundring ; nay biting &; scratching into the bargain , which for the most part is occasioned by the quarrelsom , crabbed , lavish , proud , opinionated , domineering , and unbridled nature of the female sex . Besides there are a great number ( which I will be silent of ) who do all they can to please others , and Cuckold their own husbands . And others there are that disguise themselves so excessively with strong Waters , that a whole day long they can hardly close their Floud-gates . So that you need not wonder much , if you see the greatest part of women ( tho they trick themselves never so finely up ) can hardly get husbands ; and their Parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mony with them , that they may disburthen themselves of them . Insomuch that it is easie to be seen that they are in effect of less value then old Iron , Boots and Shoes , &c.; for we find both Merchants and mony ready alwaies to buy those commodities . Therefore 0 you that are yet so happy as to have kept your selves out of this dreadfull estate of marriage , have a horror for it . Shun a woman much more than a Fish doth the hook . Remember that Solomon amongst all women kind could not find one good . Observe by what hath befallen those that went before you , what is approaching to your self , if you follow their footsteps . Of Marriage I3 ' footsteps . And be most certainly assured that the acutest pens are not able to expound the light &; feasiblest troubles and disasters of marriage , set then aside the most difficile and ponderous . Do but read with a special observation the insuing Letter of a Friends advice touching marriage ; imprint it as with a Seal upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of the glorious Apostle , It is good for man not to touch a woman . The End of the Ten Pleasures of Marriage . A r 3 2 A Letter from A LETTER From one Friend to another , Desiring to know whether it be advisable to marry . SIR , Must acknowledge that the Letter which you have writ me hath given me some incumbrance , and made me more then three times to ruminate upon the question you propounded to me concerning Marriage ; for it is a matter of great importance , that ought to be well pondered and considered of , before one should adventure to solemnize &; celebrate it . Several of my familiar friends have troubled me touching the very same subject , and I gave them every one my advice according as they were affected ; but me-thinks I ought not to deal so loose and unboundedly with you , by reason I dare speak unto you with more freedom and truth . First , there are two things which bind me strictly to you , Nature and the Affection ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evil . I will tell you my opinion , then you may t one Friend to another , &c,; 133 may use your own discretion , whether you will approve of my meaning for advice or not . For my part , I beleeve that of all the disasters we are subject to in our life time , that of Marriage takes preference from all the rest : But for as much as it is necessary for the multiplying the World , it is fit it should be used by such as are not sensible of it , and can hardly judge of the consequences thereof . Neither do I esteem any man unhappy , let whatsoever disasters there will happen to him , if he doth not fall beyond his sence so far as to take a Wife . Those troubles that may befall us otherwise , are alwaies of so small a strength ! that he who hath but the least magnanimity may easily overpower them . But the Tortures of Marriage are such a burthen , that I never saw no man , let him be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the yoke of her Tyranny . Marry then , you shall have a thousand vexations , a thousand torments , a thousand dissatisfactions , a thousand plagues ; and in a word , a thousand sort of repentings , which will accompany you to your Grave . You may take or chuse what sort of a Wife you will , she'l make you every day repent your taking of her . What cares will come then to awake and disturb you in the middle of your rest ! and the fear of some mischance or other will feed your very . spirit with a continual trouble . For a morning-alarm you shall have the children to awaken you out of sleep . Their lives 1 34 A Letter from lives shall hasten your death . You shall never be at quiet till you are in your Grave . You will be pining at many insufferable troubles , and a thousand several cogitations will be vexing your spirits at the chargeable maintenance of your Family . Insomuch that your very Soul will be tormented with incessant crosses , which alwaies accompany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a Man ought in reality to confess , that he who can pass away his daies without a Wife is the most happiest . Verily a Wife is a heavy burthen ; but especially a married one ; for a Maid that is marriageable , will do all that ever she can to hide her infirmities , till she be tied in Wedlock to either one or other miserable wretch . She overpowers her very nature and affections ; changes her behaviour , &; covers all her evil and wicked intentions . She dissembleth her hypocrisie , and hides her cunning subtleties . She puts away all her bad actions , and masks all her deeds . She mollifies both her speech and face ; and to say all in one word , she puts on the face of an Angel , till she hath found one or other whom she thinks fit to deceive with her base tricks and actions . But having caught him under the Slavery of this false apparition ; she then turns the t' other side of the Meddal ; and draws back the curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she so long had palliated , and her modesty only forbad her to reveal : By degrees then one Friend to another , &c.; 135 then vomiting up the venom that she so long had harboured under her sweet hypocrisie . And then is repenting , or the greatest understanding of no worth to you : Perhaps you may tell me , that you have a Mistriss , who is fair , rich , young , wise , airy , and hath the very majestical countenance of a Queen upon her forehead ; and that these are all reasons which oblige you to love her . But I pray , consider with your self , that a fair Woman is oftentimes tempted ; a young , perillous ; a rich , proud and haughty ; a wise , hypocritical ; an airy , full of folly ; and if she be eloquent , she is subject to speak evilly : if she be jocund and light hearted , she ' ! leave you to go to her companions , and thinks that the care of her mind , is with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatter you so well , it never grieves you . If she be open-hearted , her freedom of spirit will appear hypocritical to you : her airiness you will judge to be tricks that will be very troublesom to you . If she love playing , she ' ! ruine you . If she be liquorish and sweettooth 'd , she leads your children the ready road to an Hospital . If she be a bad Housekeeper , she lets all things run to destruction , that hath cost you so much care and trouble to get together . If she be a finical one , that will go rich in her apparel , she'l fill the Shopkeepers Counters with your mony . And in this manner her lavishness , shall destroy all your estate . To be short , let her be as she will , she shall never bring T36 A Letter from bring you much profit . In good troth , I esteem very little those sort of things , which you imagine to have a great delight in . ' T is true , if you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without either air or spirit ; that 's a continual burthen to you all your life time . The old are commonly despised ; the ugly abhor 'd ; the poor slighted ; and the innocent laught at . They are called beasts that have no ingenuity : and women without airiness , have generally but small sence of love . In these last some body might say to you , that one ought to take of them that are indifferently or reasonably well qualified . But I will surge a little higher , and tell you plainly , that that will be just like one who fearing to drown himself at the brinks of a River , goeth into the middle , to be the higher above water . You see now , why I can not advise you to marry . Yet I would not have you to beleeve , tho I so much discommend it , that it is no waies usefully profitable . I esteem it to be a holy institution ordained by God Almighty . That which makes it bad is the woman , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must then conclude never to be any thing for your self again ; but to subject your self to the toilsom will and desires of a Wife , most difficult to be born with ; to pass by all her deficiences ; to assist her infirmities ; to satisfie her insatiable desires ; to approve of all her pleasures , &; whatsoever she also will you must condescend to . one Friend to another , &c.; 137 to . Now you have heard and understood all my reasons and arguments , you may then tell me , that you have a fine estate , and that you would willingly see an heir of your own that might possess it ; and that it would be one of your greatest delights , to see your own honour and vertues survive in your children . But as to that I ' 1 answer you , and say , that your reward shall be greater in relieving the poor and needy ; then to leave rich remembrances to Heirs ; and procure you an everlasting blessing , that you might otherwise leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be are so bastardized in their birth , that they are both Spendthrifts and Vagabonds ; for it happens oft that good trees do not alwaies bring forth good fruit . If , when you have seriously perused this my Letter , you are not affrighted at your intention ; marry : but if you take it indifferently ; marry not . And beleeve me , that a man who is free from the troubles &; vexations of marriage , is much happier and hath more content to himself in one day , then another in the whole scope of his Wedlock . And what 's more , a single man may freely and resolutely undertake all things , to Travel , go to battell , be solitary , &; live according to his own delight ; without fearing that at his death he shall leave a Widow and Fatherless children , who must be delivered over to the Fates , for their friends will never look after t hem . Hitherto I have kept you up , concerning your t 13 8 A Letter , &Pc.; your intention ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by your self you may take to your self . If you marry , you do well : but not marrying , you do better . And if you will incline to mc , rather then to marry , you shall alwaies find me to be SIR Your very humble servant A. B. Fol. 145 The CONFESSION Of the New Married Couple , Being The Second Part of the Ten Pleasures of Marriage . INTRODUCTION It is an inexpressible pleasure for Travellers , when after many traverses and tossings too and again , they return quietly home to their studies and rememorates all the unexpected pleasure that they encountred with upon the Inc Coast , and the horrible vexations and contusions that they had upon another . And the very penning thereof , doth , as it were anew , reposses them of all the pleasures , and conveyeth them through all the Countries , without so much as the least moving of a foot . Just so it ; goes with those that have been under the . li , inuls of Matrimony , and are loosed from them : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and // and in quiet , can the more seriously rememorate and recogitate what pleasures they injoied at one , and what thwartings and crosses they met with at other times . And the writing down of these , doth not only afresh regenerate in them the received pleasures ; but serves also for a Looking-glass to all married Couples , for them to recogitate what pleasures they have already received , and what joys are still approaching towards them . And for those which as yet know not the sweetness of the Nuptial estate , it serves for a Fire-Beacon that they may with all earnestness Sail unto it , and possess those joys also . Of those we have before demonstrated unto you Ten Pleasant Tables : But because the Scale of Marriage may hang somwhat evener , and not fall too light on the womens side , we shall for the Courteous Reader add unto them Ten Pleasures more , being that which some Married people have since confessed , or to be short with you , was formerly wink 'd at , and passed over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The young Couple begin to keep Shop , and demand their promised Portion . Till now , 0 new Married Couple , you have passed through the First part of your Wedlock with feasting and pleasures , and have injoied no small delights in it . But what is there in this World that we grow not weary of ? You have seen that the sumptuosest Feast full of delicate dishes , and the pleasurablest Country Scituations , with al their rich fruits , finally cloggeth , through the continual injoyment of them . Nevertheless it is the generall desire of all persons , forasmuch as it is possible , to live in the World in pleasure and delights . Amongst the rest the gain of mony is none of the smallest pleasures , and this appears to be the least burthensom , tho it have much trouble in it . Therefore is it very much commendable , 0 young Couple , though you have a pretty estate of your own , according as your Contract of Marriage testifies , and as we have also seen by the Wedding you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependances , that you begin to meditate how to make the best benefit of your Mock ; and so much the more , because your Predecessors got it with a slavish diligence , reaped it together with sobriety , kept it with care , // care , and finally left it unto you for your great pleasure . It is then also not strange , if you , as true bred children , keep it carefully , and make the best profit of it ; to the end , that your Successors , when time shall serve , may find that they have had frugall Parents ; and so walk in your footsteps . Verily this is one of the necessariest meditations in the ' World . If we could but any waies make the dead sensible of it in their grave , undoubtedly the Reliques of your Parents would rejoice at so happy and carefull an intention of you their children . And truly , what is there , among other cogitations , more pleasurable , then to begin with a handsom Shop-keeping ? For this through the daily gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a merry life . ' T is true , Merchandize bears a greater respect , and yeelds also sometimes great gains ; but with these trouble somtimes , it is for the most part subject to great and weighty losses , which is the destruction of young people , and so intangles the merriest part of their lives , that fears and cares deprives them of their night rest . If the wind blow hard , they are presently in a fear that the Ships at sea laden with their Goods and Wares may be Shipwrack 'd . If they will assure them , then the Assurer goes away with the profit : and they are also so greedy and cunning , that the least storm or bad tiding makes them very slow and circumspect ; or if they be not so , Of the New Married Couple 1 4.9 so , it is to be feared , so there happen many losses , that then the Assurer himself might come to be lost . But the handsom Shop-keeping is the surest and pleasurablest ; for every moment you get new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy continually with ready mony ; or otherwise pay the old score , and trust the new . Yea all the news that goes about the City , is brought home and imparted to you . There 's not a man dies , or woman brought to bed , but you have knowledge of it . Well then , what greater pleasure can there be then this ? Also , young Woman , you may , through love and care , herein be assistant to your husband oftentimes , which you can not do in Merchandize , and so by degrees learn to understand the Shop , and converse neatly with the customers ; whereby you can in his absence , also help the customers , and give them pleasing answers , insomuch that you oftentimes attain to as perfect a knowledge of the Trading , as your husband himself . You are happy , yea ten times over happy , 0 housewively young Woman in this choice , and that not only for your husband , but principally for your self . For if that mischance might happen to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find your self oftentimes setled in a way of Trading , which you can manage your self , and set forward with reputation . // reputation . Nay though you might happen to have children , you have the opportunity your self to bring them up in the same way , and so get a due , faithfull and carefull assistance from them , which will not so well be done by Men and Maid-servants , and over whom there is seldom so much command , as over ones own children . And if your husband continue in health , and find that Trading grows quick , he perceives that by the assistance of his wife , something else may be taken by the hand that is also profitable , and then he will alwaies exercise some sort of Merchandise that is secure and advantagious . It is most certain , sweet Woman , you will be the more tied to your housekeeping , and can not so often go to visit and take your pleasure with your Gossips as you formerly did , in Coaches or by Water ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand ; because that a Woman who is married to a Shopkeeper , is as it were also wedded to the Counter , by reason you dare not trust your Shop to old , much less to new men or Maid-servants , because they do not perfectly understand the Trade , and thereby also find occasion to make one bed serve for both and junket together ; which makes no small confusion in the family ; but little regard must be taken about that , for the importantest must alwaies be taken care of . And be assured , if the desire of gain , small Trading , and bad paiment , begin once to take possession Of the New Married Couple 151 possession of you , the thoughts of all the former pleasures will remove , and you will exchange them for those that are more noble and becoming , viz. in the well governing of your Men and Maid-servants in the Shop and House , and taking inspection that they be obedient unto you ; the Family must be wel taken care of ; going to Market with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her dress it to your mind ; and every Market day precisely , with the Maid neatly drest , and following you with a hand-basket , go to take a view of Newgate , Cheapside , and the Poultry Markets ; and afterwards , when your got a little farther , then to have your Baby carried by you , neatly and finically drest up ; and in hearing of it , whilest it is in the standing stool , calling in its own language so prettily Daddy and Mammy . 0 that is such an extraordinary pleasure , that where ever you go , what soever you delight in , all your delight is , to be at home again in your Shop , by your servants ; and most especially ( when you have it ) to be by your Baby . And if you do get a fit to be gadding abroad with some of your friends and neighbours ( for one can not alwaies be tied as if they were in Bridewell , nor the Bow ever stiff bent ) why then you have Ascen-sion-day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if t hat he too short , presently follows Whitsontide , then you may sing tantarroraara three daies together , 15 2 The CONFESSION , together , and get your fill of it . So that you may find time enough to take your delight and pleasure , tho you be a little tied to a Shop . This being then in such manner taken into a ripe deliberation by some of the nearest relations , it is concluded on to set up a handsom Shop , and to furnish it with al sorts of necessaries ; and by that means make that you may alwaies say Yea and never No to the Customers . O how glad the good Woman is , now she sees that her husband , who is otherwise somewhat stifnecked , lets himself be perswaded to this , by his friends ! and how joyfull is the husband that his Wife , who at first seemed to be high-spirited , is now herewith so absolutely contented . O happy Match , where the delight and pleasure of both parties , is bent upon one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bands of Wedlock and love together ! Certainly to be of one mind , may very well be said to be happily married , and called a Heaven upon Earth . Here they are cited to appear who display the married estate too monstrously , as if there were nothing but horrors and terrors to be found in it . Now they would see how that Love in her curious Crusible , melteth two hearts and ten sences together . To this all Chymists vail their Bonnets , though they brag of their making the hardest Of the New Married Couple 153 hardest Minerals as soft as Milk and Butter . This Art surpasseth all others . Yet here ought to be considered what sort of Trading shall be pitcht upon . The man hath good knowledge in Cloath , Silk stufs , French Manufactures and Galantries , &c.; But the Woman thinks it would be much better , if they handled by the gross in Italian Confits , Candied and Musk sugar plums , Raisons of the Sun , Figs , Almonds , Pistaches , Bon Christian Pears , Granad-Apples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wines , delicate Sack , Muskadine , and Frontinyack Wine ; which is a Negotiation , pleasing to the ey , delicious for the tast , and beloved by all the World . And by this she thinks she shall procure as many Customers as her husband , because she hath familiar acquaintance with severall brave Gentlewomen , that throw away much mony upon such commodities , and make many invitations , Treats and Feastings . And she her self could alwaies be presently ready , when she received an honourable visit . O happy man , who hath gotten such an ingenious understanding wife ! that takes care and considers with her self for the doing all tit and necessary things to the best advantage . And really she is not one jot out of the way , for this sort of Merchandize is both relishing and delightfull , and must be every foot bought again . Now // Now the time requires going to market to buy Fir , Oak , and Sackerdijne Wood , and to order that the Shop may be neatly built and set up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very neat Joiner and Cabinet-Maker , is of your very good acquaintance , and so near by the hand : He knows how to fit and join the pannels most curiously together , and so inlaies , shaves , and polishes the fine wood , that you would swear it is all of one piece . Well here again is another new pleasure and delight ! If all things go thus forward , certainly the wedding-cloaths will in a short time be , at the least , a span too little . 0 how glad you'l be , when this trouble is but once over ! and that the Shop is neatly built , painted , gilt , furnished , and finely put into a posture . O how nobly it appears , and how delightfull and pleasing it will be when this new Negotiant sees his Shop full of Customers , and he at one Counter commending , praising and selling , and one servant bringing commodities to him , and another hath his hands full with measuring and weighing ! And his beloved at another Counter finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discoursing with the Customers . Then it wil not seem strange unto you , how it came to pass that your Predecessors got such fine sums of mony together , and left them unto you to be merry with . Therefore you ought also , even as they did , to provide your Of the New Married Couple 155 your selves with a curious and easie to be remembred Sign , because your Customers by mistake might not come to run into your Neighbors Shops . I have not yet forgotten that your Grandfather , being a Wollen Draper , first hung out the Sign of the Sheep , and his name was James Thomson , but by reason of his great custom , they called him , by the nick name , of James in the Sheep ; which remains still as a name to the generation . And in like manner your wives Grandfather , a well customed Shopkeeper in silk-stufs , whose name was William Jackson , hung out the sign of the Silkworm , but his son going to school with another boy whose name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , they gave him the name of William the Silkworm , which also remains as a name to the Family . This is not common only among the Londoners , but in other Cities and Country Towns , also among Coachmen , Wagoners , and others . But come we wil take our leaves of these people , and turn again to our new married Couple , who can hardly rest quietly a nights , for the earnest desire they have to see all things accomplished , and their Trading going forward . And in time Tom Thumb got on his doublet , he was seven years pulling on the first sleeve . Yet before you come to this great pleasure , yowl meet with a troublesom obstruction in the i6 2'he CONFESSION , the way , which if you can but turn of bravely , it will be much the pleasanter . For before the Shop is fully furnisht , you will see what there will be wanting to fill all the corners and places with commodities that must be sold by length of time , and to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect the coming of mony from slow and bad paymasters : therefore it begins to be time to speak of the promised Portion . Uds bud , what a racket is here now ! For the young mans father had made his full account that he should not already be dun 'd for the promised Portion ; not doubting but that the young womans lay all totally ready told of in bags ; and thought to take it in the best sence , I will pay my son his interest yearly ; and afterwards , in peaceable times , when there 's little or no impositions , and that my Coffers are better furnisht , will then give him the principal . And seriously the old man seems to deal herein very cordially , since other mens fathers do not do half so well , and only give this for an answer , With young men must be promised , and with daughters must be given . And others make their sons give them a bond , wherein he , as by example , acknowledgeth to be indebted to his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and promiseth to give in marriage with his son six hundred pound : which at Of the New Married Couple 157 at last comes to nothing at all , and only serves for a perfect cheat to deceive and hood-wink the eys of the pretended Gentlewoman and her Guardians . It is no wonder where such Matches are made , if , when such things are discovered , there be a great deal of time spent , before they can come to the true pleasure . But you , 0 new married man , who have a liberal father on your side , you can get provisionally your interest , and when times mend your principal . Perhaps it will not be half so well with your wives estate , for she it may be her maiden estate , bath spent and run out more in gaudy apparel , to intice a Lover , then the interest of her estate could bear , insomuch that the principal is diminished , or the revenues thereof received and consumed long before they were due . ' s Wounds in what a sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this approaching new Shop-keeper in ! How earnestly he runs to her Guardians , to see if they will unriddle him this doubt that he is in . But to his good fortune , Ile finds it in a much better condition than he thought he should . For his dearest , hath spent touch less in her apparelling and maintenance , then she could have done , so that there 's not only molly in stock , but rents of her real estate that are yet to be paid unto her , though there was very much consumed for her Brides apparel and 15 8 the CONFESSION , and the other accoutrements . Well this is an extraordinary pleasure , and a great comfort for his panting heart . Uds life how many hundred kisses are now offered at the Altar of her sweet lips , that otherwise would not so much as have been thought upon . Therefore one may easily perceive that mony increaseth love very much ; and that Lovers in these times are so bent upon mony , and so diligent in search of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Guardians , and up and down by unsworn Brokers , who negotiate with a very close intelligence in this sort of Flesh-Trade , and draw ten double salaries ( and that ofttimes too from both sides ) if they can but help anyone to a good bargain , and that he obtains access ; and afterwards wheedle it about so , that it finally comes to be a match . But what sad issue generally such sort of Matches are attended with , is well known to the whole World . You , 0 Lovers , who seek to be Livry men of the great Company , and aim to possess the pleasures of Marriage , have a care of the inchanting voices of these crafty Syrens , because they intend to batter you upon the Scylla and Charibdis where the Hellish Furies seem to keep their habitation . These are the only Occasioners of bad Matches , and such as raise a Scandal of that Estate , which at once affoards both Pleasure , Mirth and Joy . But our new married Couple went clear another Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to their full contentment , act so many pretty Apish tricks , injoy such multiplicities of kindnesses , and toss each other such quantities of kisses , as if there were a whole Kingdom , or at the least a vast Estate to be gained thereby : So that they find , that in that estate , there are not only Ten , but a thousand Pleasures cemented together in it ; whereof in the following shall be demonstrated in some part the imperfect gloss , but never the accomplished Portrait . The Second Pleasure . The Husband grows Pipsy ; and keeps the first Lying-in : Takes the Doctors advice . Is mocked by his Pot-Companions . Just as one Candle lights another , so we see also , that two , sympathetically minded , know , by the cleaving of their lips together , how to breathe into each other their burning hearts-desire , wherewith the one doth as it were kindle the other , and do every moment renew and blow on again their even just now extinguished delights . Of this you have here a pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daies and Winter nights fall too short to satisfy their affections ; they hardly know how to find out time that they may bestow some few hours in rho The CONFESSION , in taking care for the ordring and setting all things in a decent posture in their new made Shop ; imagining that they shall alwaies live thus , Salamander-like in the fire , without being ever indamaged by it . But time will teach them this better . In the mean while we will make our selves merry with the pleasure of this married Couple , who see now their Shop fully in order , furnisht with severall brave goods , and a pretty young fellow to attend it . But because Customers do not yet throng upon them , they find no other pastime then to entertain each other in all manner of kind imbracements , and to chear up their hearts therein to the utmost . Here it may be plainly seen how pleasant and delightfull it is for the young woman , because her physiognomy begins to grow the longer the more frank and jocund . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her souls content , e 're since her Wedding day . But just as a burning Candle doth consume , though to it self insensible , yet maketh of hers joyfull by its light , so doth our new married Man , before few months are expired , find that he becomes the very subject of flouting at and laughter , among his former boon Companions ; because every one jestingly tells him , that he is sick of a fever , that the paleness of his Face , the lankness of his Cheeks , and thinness of his Calves , doth shew it most plainly . And Of the New Married Couple 161 And verily there are some artificial Jesters who do it so neatly , that he himself beleeves it almost to be true : yet nevertheless , to avoid their mockeries , casts it of from him as far as possible may be . But his own opinion doth so clearly convince him , that in himself he ponders and considers what course is best to be taken . But housoever as long as he goes and walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the tide will turn again . Yet finding himself inwardly weaker of body rallies with his own distemper , in hopes that by his jesting , among his merry Companions , he may from them understand what is best , upon such occasions , to be done or avoided ; and they seriously jesting say to him : 0 friend , wean yourself from your wife and Tobacco , and drink Chocolate , and eat knuckles of Veal , or else you ' ! become like one of Pharaohs lean Kine . Oh ho , thinks he , if that be true , I have spent my reckoning this evening very happily . Now young woman , do n't you admire if your husband comes home at night discontented in mind , for his wits run a Wool-gathering , and he has walkt in a dump from Towerhill to Tuttle Fields contriving what 's best for him to do , and how to compass the matter neatly . For to remain so from his dear and delicate Wife , not paying unto her the usual family duty , is below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the matter is , is yet worse . To leave of Tobacco // Tobacco , and eat knuckles of Veal , is feasible . But to go to a Coffehouse and alwaies drink Chocolate , that sticks against the stomack . Nevertheless Necessity hath no Law . And the Occasion overpowers affection . Insomuch that after a thousand pondrous considerations , he resolves to deny his dearly beloved Wife a little of that same ; and to that purpose will somtimes in an evening feign to have the headake , or that he is very dull and sleepy , ( which is no absolutely ; ) and thereby commands his man to call him up somtimes very early in the morning , as if there were forsooth Customers in the Shop , &c.; and hunts up and down among the Chocolate Dealers to get of the very best , preparing it himself in milk , treating all that come to visit him with Chocolate instead of Tobacco ; and he feigning that he hath an extraordinary delight in it ; and on the other side , perswade his wife that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veal , some good broath , and new-laid Egs , or some such sort of pretty conceited diet . But perceiving that this avails little , and that he grows rather weaker then stronger ; away he trots to the Scotch Paduan Doctor , who immediately prescribes a small Apothecaries Shop , at the least twenty or more several sorts of herbs , to be infused in a pottle of old Rhenish wine , and twice a day to drink half a quartern thereof at a time : Item a Plaister to be Of the New Married Couple 163 be applied to his Stomack ; and an unguent for the pit of the Stomack , under alit , nose , and to chafe the Temples of the head but most especially to keep a good strengthning diet , &c.; But this seems to have too much stir in the view of his wife ; therefore must be laid aside ; and away he goes then to a High German Doctor , who without stop or stand , according to the nature of his country , Mountebank-like begins to vaunt , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh Sir , you are a brave , but a weak Knight , you have walkt too much in the mid-paths of the Garden , and plukt too often from the Rose-tree , if you make not use of my noble remedies , you'l have a great fit of sickness ; but if you do take it , you'l be very quickly and dextrously cured ; in such a manner , that like a Warriour you may both storm and take the Fortress , and triumph over it . Be sure then to make often use of the whites of Geese and Ducks-Egs roasted , Red-Cabidge boild with fat meat , old Hens beaten to pieces , Cox-combs , Sweet breads , Sheeps and Goats milk boild with Rice ; you must also often eat Calves and Pigeons brains with Nutmeg grated in them ; and drink temperately Rhenish Wine ; it is most certain that by a frequent doing of this , you will grow both able and strong again ; and it will also be very acceptable to your dearly beloved . Here stands the poor Cully again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceives that this Doctor Jobbernole gives him an abundance of words but few effects for his mony ; because all his boasting , doth , for the most part , contain what he had before made use of ; and is therefore unwilling to trouble his wives brain with all that boiling and stewing , and all the rest of the circumstances . This makes him take a resolution Of the New Married Couple 165 resolution to let it take its course . But still growing weaker and weaker , is at last fain to keep his bed , and constrained to send for one of our own Country Doctors , and makes his complaint to him , that he is troubled with an excessive head-ake , weakness in the reins of his back , a lameness in his joints that he can hardly lift his arm to his head ; together with a foulness of his stomack , which makes him that he can retain nothing , but is forc't to vomit all up again , &c.; Out of all which reasons the Doctor perfectly understands the ground of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals it unto him . O how delicately these Cards are shufled ! if the game go thus forward , it will come to be a stately Pleasure ! but principally for the Doctor , who privately simpers at the playing of his own part , and never fails to note down his Visits ; but most especially if he have the delivery of the Medicins into the bargain ; placing them then so largely to account as is any waies possible to be allowed of ; which makes the Apothecary burst out into such a laughter , as if he had received the tiding of a new Bankrupt . But go you forwards Doctor , it must be so , you have not studied for nothing ; and it is no small matter to be every time ordering of new remedies ; especially when we see that you constantly write . r 66 T'he CONFESSION , And then again to eat oftentimes Pistaches , Almonds , Custards , and Tansies , &c.; Though since the Patient , like making a Martyr of himself , is in this manner fallen into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wife is not negligent to acquaint all the friends with it ; who immediately come running to give a visit to the sick , and speak words of consolation to the good woman . But alas grief and sorrow bath taken such deep root in her heart , that no crums of comfort , though ever so powerfull , can dispossess her calamities : for the seeing of a husband who loved her so unmeasurably , and was so friendly and feminine , to ly sick a bed , would stir up the obdurest heart to compassion , and mollifie it with showers of tears . But even as all the Relations , by messengers , are made acquainted with this sickness ; report in like manner is not behind hand with making it known to good acquaintance and arch Jesters , who ( as I shewed you before ) are very ready to appear with their flouts and gibes , and instead of comforting , begin to laugh with the Patient , saying : 0 Sir , we have perceived , a long time since , that you were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much nearer then your wives ; and we alwaies thought , because we had tasted out such delicate Weddingwine for you , that you would have desired us to have taken the like care for to have such at yours , and afterwards at your Wives lying-in . Yet since it Of the New Married Couple i 6 7 it hath not so hapned , we hope that the Doctor hath taken so much the better care for it . Thus rallying , they begin to get the bibbingbottle , and guess at the same time , as if it had been told them , that the Doctor in his ; last receipt had ordered Rhenish Wine . And just as the Women in the Eighth Pleasure of the First Part produce abundance of Remedies ; the assembly of Men do here in like manner cast up a hundred Receits which makes Peggy the maid blush and be most cruelly ashamed at ; but behind the Window she listens most sharply to hear what 's told and confessed by those that be in the Chamber , as to the further matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was travelling the last Summer into the North , and so forwards into Scotland , going through Edenburgh , met there with his coufin Master Coldenough , who look 'd so lean and pale-fac 'd ; that Master Barebreech told him , in truth Cousin , I should hardly have known you ; verily you look as if you were troubled ; and I beleeve you have the feeling of a first lying-in through all your joints . Well Cousin , saies the t' other , it seems that you are deeply studied in the Art of Witchcraft , for I fear its too true . I went from home on purpose to take my pleasure for three weeks or a month , that I might store my self with fresh provisions , and sing a sweet ditty in commendations of my Betty . Ho , Ho , saith Master Barebreech , // Barebreech , flatter not your self with such a fancy , that you ' ! get as much up again in three weeks or a month , as you have been running behind hand in four . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into France , there 's a gallant air , and we shall be very good company together , and fear not but that we'l make much of our selves ; then when we come home again , you'l find your self so well , and both you and your wife will be thankfull to me as long as you live for my good advice of taking this journy . To be short , the Cousins travell together , and Master Coldenough came home so lusty , fat and plump , that all his acquaintance , and especially his hungry wife , admired mightily that he was so fat and corpulent . At this all the jesting-wags burst out into a laughter . But having toss 'd up their cups bravely about again , Peggy comes in with a fresh Kan , and Master Winetast begins to relate how that he used to be familiarly acquainted with a certain brave Judge , who had a bucksom bouncing Lady to his wife . The Judge feigns a Letter , which at noon , as he was sitting at Table with his Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seemingly unknowing of it , opens and reads , that he must immediately , without further delay , go upon a journy ; having read that , prepares himself with his man forthwith to be going . But whilest the Judge was gone into his Closet , as seeming to take some important writings Of the New Married Couple 169 writings along with him ; the Lady calls his man privately into the Parler , and forces him by threats of her displeasure to tell her , who delivered him that Letter ; with a promise of her favour if he spoke the truth . Whereupon the fellow trembling , answered , Madam , I have received it from my Lord the Judge ; but he hath strictly commanded me to keep it secret , so that if he come to know that I have mentioned any thing of it to your Ladiship , he will have the greatest displeasure of the World against me . Do not you fear anything , said her Ladiship , but be faithfull in what you do . A pretty while after , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his Lady towards their Garden , they met with a drove of Sheep , having but one Ram amongst them : Whereupon her Ladiship askt , Sweetheart , how comes it , that that one Sheep hath such horns , and the t'others none at all ? My Dear , said he , that is the Ram , the He-Sheep . What , said she , are the others then all She 's ? 0 yes , my Love , answered he . How ! replied she , but one Ram among so many Sheep . Yes Hony , saies the Judge , that is alwaies so , then ( sighingly she said ) alas poor Creature , how must you long then to walk some other Road ! There had been more related ; for Master ( Carouser was entred upon a new subject ; but because the Doctor came in , they were con , t ! to break of . But // But Ellen the starchster , being busie in the Kitchin with the Mistriss about ordering the Linnen , having let the Doctor in ; saith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gone into the Chamber ; by my truly Mistriss , I hear say that my Master hath got a fever . 0 Nei , saith the Mistriss , this is clear another thing , this sickness is not without great danger ; and it would be no such wonder , if my husband hapned to dy of it ; and where should we then find the Pleasures of Marriage that some arch Jesters so commonly talk of . But kind Mistriss be not so hasty , it is impossible to express all the Pleasures so fully in one breath : you must note , that they are all as it were for the present hid behind the Curtains ; neither must you expect to sail alwaies before wind and tide ; and beleeve me there are yet other Nuts to be krackt . The Third Pleasure . Whilest the Husband is from home , the Wife plaies the Dive/ fir God 's sake . The Husband upon his journy will want for nothing . I T seemed to be a divellish blur in the Escucheon , and a cruel striving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just made and furnisht , then the good Man falls . sick , and keeps the first Lying in . But 9 17 2 7'h e CONFESSION , and using all arguments possible to enliven and make her sorrowfull heart merry ; either of them striving to be most free in proffering to be her bedfellow , and the next day to keep her company : But alas , saies she , suppose ye did all this , yet nevertheless I have not my husband with me ! But because time and good company help to decline and pass away sorrow ; she very happily begins to consider , that she hath now a fit opportunity , to invite her Neeces and Bridemaids and other good acquaintance , with whom she hath been formerly mighty familiar , to come and take a treat with her , and to drink a dish of Tee ; for they have , when she was in her Maiden estate , treated her so many times with Tarts , Pankakes and Fritters , Custards , and stew 'd Pruins , that she is as yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she never could find an occasion that was convenient before , because one while she dwelt with her Guardians , and at another time with her Uncle ; who took very sharp notice where on , and in what time her pocket-mony was spent and consumed , that they continually gave her for trivial expences . Which vext her so much the more , because the treat she received , was for the most part done , to bring her acquainted with this or that Gentlewomans Brother , or Cousin , or some other pretty Gentlemen ; to the end , that by this means she might happen Of the New Married Couple 173 happen to make a gallant Match ; and indeed the first original of the wooing , and acquaintance with her beloved , had there its foundation . To treat these Gentlewomen when her husband is at home , would no waies appear so well ; and so much the more , because they generally suffer themselves to be conducted to the place by one or other of their Gallants ; who then either very easily are persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take part with them . Therefore this must be done and concluded on , because she bath now the disposal and keeping of the mony as well as her husband . Here now must Doll run up and down tantwivy to borrow a Rowling-pin , and some other new invented knick-knacks , to bake Cheesekakes and Custards in ; whilest Mage is also hardly able to stand longer upon her legs , with running tip and down to fetch new-laid Egs , Flour , Sugar , Spices , blanch 'd Almonds , &c.; The M Mistriss and Doll are able to perform this duty well enough ; for they both helpt to do it , very neatly at her Neeces birth-day ; but the Pastry-Cook must be spoken to for the making a delicate minc 'd Py ; and Mage must run to the Confit-makers in Black-Fryers , to fetch some Conserves , Preserves , and of all other sorts of Sweetmeats , Raisins of the Sun , and more of the like ingredients , &c.; for she knows best where all those things are to be had . And for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 74 the CONFESSION , of Venison , a couple of Neats-tongues , a delicate peece of Martelmas beef , some Anchovis , and Olives for the Gentlemen , because they certainly will accompany the Gentlewomen . And truly they that bring them , may very well tarry to carry them home again ; it is also but one and the same trouble . Goodman Twoshoes is gone out of Town , and sees it not , neither need he know it when he comes home : He treats so many of his friends and acquaintance , and then again next day following invites them to a Fish-dinner . I may very well play my part once in my life , and have all things to my mind , let come o n't what will , who knows whether such another occasion may happen again this three years . And against next morning , very privately , she invites the Gentlewomen alone , to come about nine a clock in the morning , to eat hot Buns , and Cakes , for then they come precisely out of the Oven ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pankakes and Fritters , and a glass of the purest Canary let it cost n'er so much , or be fetcht ne'r so far . Thus runs the tongue of this pretty housewife , that but a while ago was so sorrowfull for the departure of her beloved husband . Certainly there 's nothing comes out more suddenly , or dries up more easily , then womens tears ! But hangt no more of that ; for the guests will be here presently , therefore all things ought to be in order for mirth . And moreover there Of tide New Married Couple 175 there are some of them that frequent Mr. Baxter 's Puritanical Holding-forth , whose heads will immediately , in imitation of their Patron , hang like Bull-rushes ; for they are taught to mourn with the sorrowfull , and to rejoice with the joifull . But it is now a time to be merry , and throw away masks and vizards ; for all is done under the Rose , and among good acquaintance . And verily if the good woman had not this or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasures of marriage ? for in the first Lying-in of the husband there was no looking for them . Come on then , that mirth may be used , let the Cards also be brought in sight ; which formerly , out of a Puritanical humour , ought not to have been seen in a house ; nay , not so much as to have been spoken of ; but now every one knows how to play artificially at Put , all Fours , Omber , Pas la Bete , Bankerout , and all other games that the expertest ( ; arresters can play at . And who knows whether they do not carry in their Pockets , as False-Gamesters do , Cards that are cut and marked . They learn to play the game at Bankerout so well with the Cards , that in a short time they can and also do it with their Housholdstuf , Wares , and Commodities . To he sure , you ' ! alwaies find , that every one of them , by length of time , are capable . of setting up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And // And most especially they learn to discourse very exactly touching the use and misuse thereof ; just as these dissimulating Wigs intend to do , though indeed men have never seen that they practised this lesson themselves . But , although the Mistriss and her Companions know little or nothing of these tricks , they serve howsoever , without setting up a School , and that also for nothing , for good Instructresses to their servants , who hereby are most curiously taught , what paths they have to walk in , and what 's best for them to do that they may follow their Mistresses footsteps , as soon as their Master and Mistriss are but gone abroad together ; who then know so exactly how to dance upon those notes , that we thought it necessary , as being one of the principallest Pleasures of Marriage , also to be set down in the Third Table of the First Part . Many women , who are sick of this liquorish and sweet-tooth 'd disease , will be grumbling very much at this , that such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and say that Batchelors hereby will be afraid to marry ; But if they , and the Gentlewomen that were in private domineering together , had not gone to Confession , and made a publick relation of it , who would have known it . Therefore this sort of well treated female Guests , are like unto those that when they have gotten a delicate Of the New Married Couple 177 delicate bit by the by , can not fare well but they must cry roast-meat , though they should be beaten with the spit for it . But the good ones , though they are thin sown , who are not distempered with this evil , never trouble themselves at what one will say , or another write concerning women , because their guiltless consciences , serves them as well as a thousand witnesses ; and they are very indifferent whether that the deceased scandal raiser Hippolitus do arise , and come into the World again ; daring him in this manner Surge then Hippolytus , out from thy Ghostly nest : Who scandal least esteem , revenge themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless I must furnish the delicate stomackt Ladies with some sort of weapons , that they may be in a posture of defending themselves against their vituperous enemies : For verily there are several men that walk not so even and neat in their waies as they ought to do ; and who knows , whether our Mistresses dearly Beloved , at this very present , ( 10th not as many others have done ; who when they are travelling any whither , the first thing they do , is to be very diligent , and look earnestly about , whether there be not some handsom Gentlewoman that travels with them , by whom they very courteously take place , spewing themselves mightily humble and complacent , and telling them that they are Batchelors or M // or at the least Widowers ; then casting out a discourse of playing a game at Cards , that they may the better see what mettle the Lady is made of , and then again when they come to a Baiting-place , or where they must stay the night over , there they domineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodomontade . Where many times more is acted and spent , then they dare either tell their Wives , or their father Confessors of . Others there are , who seek not so much such company , but very artificially before hand , know how to find out such Fellow-travellers as most suit with their own humour ; to that end providing themselves with some Bottles of Canary , and pure Spanish Tobacco ; and where ever they come are sure to make choice of the best Inn , where there 's a good Table , delicate Wine , ( and a handsom Wench ) to be had . Certainly , if the Husband thus one way , and his Wife another , know how to find out the Pleasures of Marriage , they are then both of them happy to the utmost . Is it not possible , but that they might , if this continued long , take a journy , for pleasure , to Brokers-Hall ? For at first it was by them esteem 'd too mean a place to be look 'd upon , and not worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into their considerations , by reason that rents are low there , provisions very cheap , and pleasures in abundance ; neither hath Pride or Ambition taken Of the New Married Couple 179 taken any habitation there . Nay , who knows but that they might chance to observe that there is no such need of feasting and junketting ; nor be subject to so many visits , because there dwells not such a number of their friends and acquaintance : and besides all this , you may there , for a small matter , agree with the Collectors of the Excises , so that , for a whole year , you may have Wine , and severall other things plenty , for little or nothing . But let 's lay aside all this , because they are untimely cogitations , that fly astray ; and it is much decenter that we turn again to our kindhearted Mistriss , with her merry companions who now , are about the taking leave of each other ; using , to shew their gratitude , whole bundles full of complements ; offering them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honour they have received and confirm them with so many kisses , cursies , bows and conges , that it is easie to be perceived , that on both sides its cordially meant . And I ) ( ill , that good and faithfull servant , is not able to express how pleasing this entertainment hath been to all the company . Nay , it lies buzzing her so in the pate , that she can not be at quiet in a morning , whilest her Mistriss is asleep , hut she must , with the Neighbors Maids , either at the opening of the Shop , or sweeping of the street , he tatling and telling of it to them putting , every foot , into their hands privately , some 18o The CONFESSION , some Almonds and Raisins , that came in by Leger de main : Relating unto them , as if she did it by a scrole , what a horrible quantity of things she hath to scour and wash , that must be made clean , and set in order , against the time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come again alone ; and so much the more , because her Master is daily expected home . Who then finally coming in , is not ordinarily welcomed , for she is so full of joy that her husband is come home , that both her tongue and actions are incapable of demonstrating her felicity ; and he on the t' other side , is so glad to find his dearly Beloved in good health , and all things in decent order , that it is beyond imagination . All this while they both laugh in their sleeves , that each one , in th'absence of the t' other , hath taken to themselves such a private an cunning pleasure . Finding so much content and injoiment therein , that they both hope to serve themselves again with the like occasion . O mighty Pleasure of Marriage ! Who would not but be invited to go into this estate ? Especially if we proceeded to write down and rehearse the further Confession of the separate Pleasures of Man and Wife , which is preserved as matter for the insuing Fifth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Fourth Pleasure . The Wife will be Master of the Cash , or mony Chest . S Mony is one of the most curiousest Minerals , is it , in like manner , the less admirable , that the handling and use there of rendreth the greatest Pleasures of the World . It is Loves Fire , and Charities Fountain . Yea , if Man and Wife in their house keeping may he esteemed or compared to the Sun and Moon in the Firmament ; verily , those merry white or yellow boies , may very well be considered of as twinkling stars . It rejoiceth all mankind to behold in the sky the innumerable multitude of glittering Stars : hut it is a far surpassinger Pleasure , that the new married Couple receive , when they see vast heaps of Silver and Gold ly dazling their eys , and they Lording over it . You , 0 lately married Couple , possess this Pleasure to the utmost ; you have to your content received your promised Portions ; you onely want the great Iron Mony-Chest to lock it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may he laid out to advantage . 0 how pleasant the free dispensation thereof is unto you ! What . a noble Valley it is to walk in between , these Mountains , and to delight your eys with such an object ! Yet Yet // Yet nevertheless , 0 faithfull Couple , here is need that a great deal of prudence be used , as well in the laying of it out , as the preserving of it . In ancient times it hath been often observed and taken notice of , that where mony was hid , the places were generally hanted with terrible spirits , and strange Ghosts , that walked there , coming in frightfull apparitions : but since they have been driven out of our Country and Houses ; there 's another sort of Imp come in , ten times wickeder then any of the other ; which regards nor cares neither for Crosses , Holy-water , Exorcisms , or any sort of Divel-drivers ; but dares boldly shew himself at noon-day , namely a Plague-Divel , which sets Man an Wife together by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the command and government of the Cash or mony-box . And to the end he may herein act his Part well , he knows how very subtlily first to fill the weak womans ears full , that she ought above all things to have the command of the cash ; because she had such a great Portion ; and that it is her mony which she hears gingle so . And then again , because the care of the housekeeping is appropriated to be her duty , it is against all reason , that she , like a servant , should give an account to her husband , what , wherefore , or how that the mony is laid out ; because the necessaries also for house-keeping are so many , that they are without end , name or number , and it Of the New Married Couple 183 it is impossible that one should relate or ring them all into the ears of a Man . Likewise the good woman can not have so fit an occasion every foot to be making some new things , that she may follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ; ' much less to have any private pocket-mony , to treat and play the Divel for God 's sake , with her Bride-Maids , when her husband is gone from home . And on the contrary , when men pay out any thing , it goes out by great sums , according as is specified by the accounts delivered , which must be set to book , and an acquittance given : This can not be so done with every pittifull small thing that belongs to house-keeping . Insomuch that the Husband can then , with all facility , demand what Mony is needful for his occasion from his Wife . Moreover , when the Wife bath the command of the mony , she can alwaies see in what condition and state her affairs stands ; and by taking good observation thereof , her husband can not fob her off with Pumpkins for Musmillions ; but she 'll easily perceive whether she be decreasing or increasing in her estate . So that if her husband might come to dy , and she be left a Widow with several children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her affairs stands , and whether she be gotten forward or gone backward in the World . And what 's more yet , it would be a great shame 18 4 The CONFESSION , shame for a Woman , who hath alwaies been so highly respected by her husband ; and as it appeared to all the World , was honoured like a Princess ; that she should within dores be as servile as a servant ; and must be fed out of her husbands hands , just as if she were a wast-all , a sweet-tooth , or gamestress , &c.; With these , and a thousand such like arguments , doth this Plague-Divel know how to puff up the vain humours of the weak Women , to- the true pitch of high-mindedness . And on the contrary , is in the mean while busie with flatteries , to stir up the husband to idle imaginations and self-conceitedness ; demonstrating unto him , that he is the Lord , and guide of his Wife ; created to command her , and she to obey him . That it is most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , whilest that Woman who is so handsom and haughty , is nevertheless but added unto him as a servant . Therefore if he once admit his Wife into an equality with him ; he will then be subject to see that she will be striving for the predominancy : and that it is the greatest curse imaginable in a Country , for Women to Lordize over Men . And for these reasons they ought to be but like the nul in Figures , and to be kept as a Controuler by the Harth , the Pot , and the Spinning-wheel . Whilest they that deliver up to them the keys of the MonyChest , are deprived of all their superiority , and like Of the New Married Couple 185 like Men unman 'd , have only the name but can not obtain the effect . In such manner loth as yet this Divel-plaguing Spirit domineer , by clear daylight , in many of the principallest houses and hearts , and makes oftentimes so great a difference and discord about the key of the Cash , that the Cash it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Whilest the husband , perceiving that the Wife seeks to deceive and take the key from him , is alwaies possessed with abhominable suspicions ; certainly thinking that she is minded to make some unnecessary thing or other , or to hide some mony from him ; which makes him watch her waters so much the stricter ; and is not ashamed to give out and make what he hath a mind to for his own pleasure . And the Wife , perceiving that her husband is so sneaking , and forsooth so circumspect , with subtilety contrives and practises how to make him pay out mony for all what she bath any waies a mind to ; by that means making her self Mistriss of the Mony-Chest , beyond his knowledge , though he hath the name , and carries the keys in his Pocket : for if she have a mind to new Stays for her self or daughter ; away she goes to a Silk-shop , buies Stuf to her mind , and causeth it to be made as modish as possible may be ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then it is brought home by one or other of her trusty acquaintance , 1 86 77e CONFESSION acquaintance , who come at a convenient time appointed , just like some petty Brokester , proffering it forsooth in sale to the Mistriss , and telling her a relation that it was really made for such a Lady , but that she died whilest it was making ; and for that reason it may be had for a very low price ; yea , that it is such a cheap bargain , that perhaps the like may not be had again this ten years , &c.; Thus the good wife knows rarely well how to play her part , and begins to reckon how many ells of Stuff , how much for lining , and the making thereof would come to cost : so that her husband , by reason of the cheapness is curious of himself to desire her to try it on ; and finally , sees that it fits her , as if it had been made for her . To be short , after much cheapning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be against the husbands stomack , or the Cash wel can bear it ; and then the Broker is ordered when she hath such or the like other good bargain to come again , and let them see it . In this manner the Wife fetches about by the by as much as she can , and hoodwinking her husband e'en as she pleases ; for at other times there comes to be sold Table-cloaths , Napkins , and then again Coats , Sheets , Blankets , and all sorts of necessaries for housekeeping and habit , from some Gentlewoman or other that its left to , by the decease of some friend , &c.; Insomuch Of the New Married Couple 187 Insomuch that the Wife , through the niggardliness of her husband , imbezles away and buies more , then otherwise she would do ; making it all her delight and sole pleasure , to blind fold her narrow-soul 'd Peep in the Pot , ( as she calls him ; ) although she , by these waies and means , cloth jestingly consume her own self . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the conclusion prove to be a pain , patience is the best remedy . But be merry , 0 new married Couple , that you , like unto young Toby , have found out the remedy , how to drive away this Devil-Plaguer of your Wedlock ; by living in love and tranquility , equally confiding in each other , desiring no superiority ; but with a true cordiality , interchangeably granting , and having each alike freedom of the monies ; the Husband hath the keeping and government of the keys , and the Wife wants for no mony ; nay hath access also her self to it . Who can doubt but that your family will be blest , and your stock of monies increase . And that so much the more , because the Husband hates playing at Tables , and the Wife is an enemy to Cards , which hath been the occasion ofttimes on both sides of the consuming much mony , and therefore is little used by some Shopkeepers ; leaving that to Gentlemen to lose both time and mony , who therein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in like manner imitated by many great Ladies , who z 8 8 The CONFESSION , who are often so cruelly addicted to Cardplaying , that they somtimes value not , in one evening , the losing of very great sums , and yet know how to maintain their respects therein very prudently and gallantly ; but in the mean while let the Millaner , Linnen-Draper , Tailor , and Shoemaker run most miserably and shamefully after them for moneys from one month to another , ofttimes from one year to another , as if they came begging to them for a peece of bread ; and when they do pay them , it must not be taken notice of by their Lords and husbands . These generally use the greatest violence against the peace of the Family ; because this superfluous expence , and liberal disposition of my Lady , is very seldom pleasing to my Lord , who little thought that her Ladiship would have been such a spend-thrift of the Cash . But since great Lords , as well as other meaner sorts of persons , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cupid , they are in like manner subject to such casualities of adversities and pleasures ; and every one perceives , when it is too late , what kind of election he hath made ; just as they do who begin a War , but before its half finished are weary of it . Therefore I'o Battel be ye slow , but slower be to Wed , For many do repent , until/ that they be dead ; But if avoided then , by you it can not be , A thousand Counsellors will well deserve your Fee . The Of the New Married Couple 9 The Fifth Pleasure . Of Mens negligence of their afairs ; whereby their Antic-tricks and loss of time is discovered . Verily the Women , being the weakest Vessels , are many times most cruelly impeacht , when the Marriage-Ship sails not well before Wind and Tide : just as if they , to whom is only given the charge of the Family , care of the Kitchin , and nourishment of the Children , were the occasioners of sad caslualities and disasters in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negligence of the Men is many times so great , that if the Woman knew not how to carry her self like a prudent Abigail , it would be impossible ever to bring the Ship to a safe harbour , and to free it from Shipwrack , but all things must run to a total destruction . Many men are free hereof , who are continually using their utmost indeavours , and take their chiefest delight in the promotion of their affairs , by day with their bodies , and at night with their sences , are earnestly busie in contriving them it . Whose main aim is , to live honestly , to get a good name , to shew good examples to their Children and Servants , to leave somthing to their Widows , and never to be a laughing-stock or derision to their enemies . And this manner of diligence makes no labour irksom , 1 9 07 ' / ) e CONFESSION irksom , no morning too early , nor no evening too late for them . But others , on the contrary , are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they think its much below the respect of a Man , to be seen whole daies in their houses with their Wives , and about their affairs . Then in such cases , there must , by every one in his calling , be found a multitude of lame excuses , before they can blind the eys of a quick-sighted Woman , or pin it upon her so far , that she perceives not he seeks his pleasure from her , in whom his whole delight ought to be . If it be Doctor of Physick , he forsooth hath no time to study , because he must go to visit a Patient that hath a violent Ague , to see what operation the Cordial hath done which he ordered him to take yesternight ; for if any thing else should come to it , he would certainly be a dead man , &c.; And if you do but trace his paths and Patient , it is by his friend , who yesternight was troubled with a vehement Cellar-Fever ; and at the very last , before he went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; which made his Pulse beat so Feaverish and disorderly the next morning , that he was necessitated , at one draught , to whip off a lusty glass of Wormwood-Wine , ( an excellent remedy for the Ague ; ) and then to walk an hour or two upon it , wherein the Doctor accompanying him , it causes the better operation . Here Of the New Married Couple 19 t Here now you see the Doctor , and what Ague the Patient hath , what he takes for't , what comes to it , and how dead a man he is . Truly the Doctor hath made as neat a guess at it , as if he had studied long for it . Hang the Books , when a man hath his Art so perfect in his Pate . For this , the Doctor bath so much good again , when he hath a mind to visit a Patient in Tuttle-street , or St. Jameses Square , this Patient walks along with him for company . And when one hand washes the other in this manner , 0 then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to the Counsellors , and see how their Studies are all on Fire , only to be going too and again from one Court to another , to hear , forsooth , this or t' other Cause pleaded , that mightily concerns them , thereby to take their measures accordingly : When to the contrary , it serves to no other purpose then to sell a parcel of Chatwood , and tatle tales , of some brave Practitioners , a great deal worse then women would do ; and finally to appoint a place , where in the evening they may accompany their Fraternity at a good glas of Wine . Under this bundle resorts continually the Shittlecock Excisemen , accompanied with Collectors and Promooters , who are the greatest Bellringers in Taverns , and somtimes , in one evening , spend as much in Rhenish Wine , Oisters and " Tobacco ; as ten sufficient Families would do in a month . These live without care , and command freely                    @
