Nigger , the little yapping terrier bitch of Edward of Wales , + whined disconsolately by day , all last week , and howled eerily by night . Servants at H. R. H. 's bachelor quarters in York House , London , could not quite shake off uneasy qualms aroused by the dog 's palpable terror and grief . Suppose , just suppose the little bitch knew , with feminine intuition , that her master would never return . Absurd-yet Master Wales had set out , last week , to journey a long way away-to South &; East Africa . <P> <P> There would be more danger than might be supposed. * <P> Nervous and loyal Britons were glad that with Edward of Wales there sailed away his brother Prince Henry , Duke of Gloucester . Both young men are competent manipulators of firearms , though not crack shots like King-Emperor George V. <P> After leaving London with the minimum retinue of four aides , Their Royal Highnesses proceeded by ordinary channel steamer to Calais , by ordinary sleeping car across France to Marseilles , and thence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt . <P> No parades , no salutes , this was to be just a pleasure jaunt and big game hunt through Africa . But Britain 's leading special correspondents stalked in the offing , nosing after every elusive atom of royal news . <P> Fat King Fuad of Egypt steamed out in his serene white yacht to meet T. R. H. , as their steamer hove in to Alexandria . Even distant observers could discern His Majesty 's obsequious nervousness . He is a British puppet and in constant danger of assassination by patriots of his own race . More , he is constantly anxious lest such patriots molest or assassinate British officials in Egypt . Therefore , though precautions to protect the English princes had been tripled and re-tripled , they were entertained principally upon His Majesty 's yacht . <P> Loomed , after the brief Egyptian visit , a 17-day sail from Alexandria through the Suez Canal and down the coast of Africa to Mombasa . For the sake of comfort on this sweltering voyage the British India Steam Navigation Co. ' s S. S. Mali has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabins and constructing instead two spacious , airy bedrooms and a sumptuous sitting room for Their Royal Highnesses . <P> The program of tour includes visits to the Afric colonies and territories of Kenya , Uganda , Tanganyika , Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia , all of which lands may some day be federated into an already projected " Empire of East Africa . " <P> Though the problems of federation are already being ably grappled with by a Royal Commission , it is felt that a casual hunting trip by Edward of Wales may do something to persuade the colonies and territories that they might like to have this pleasant , popular young man for their very own East African Emperor. * <P> After thoroughly " covering " East Africa the Princes will proceed to South Africa and spend Christmas in Cape Town with their austere , not very popular uncle the Earl of Athlone , brother to Her Majesty Queen Mary , and Governor General of the Union of South Africa . <P>                  @ @ @
