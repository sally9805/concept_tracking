The New Republic and The Nation , liberal intellectual weeklies of relatively small circulation , are an issue in Los Angeles politics . They were ousted from the libraries of the Los Angeles public schools during the war - The Nation for being " pacifist " and The New Republic for being " radical " - and now there is a strong movement to have them reinstated on the ground that they contain data essential in the study of public affairs . Candidates for election to the School Board , which will be held in the near future , are being asked to define their attitude toward the forbidden periodicals . Neither The New Republic nor The Nation is radical in the proper sense of the word , since they do not advocate socialism , syndicalism , communism nor any other revolutionary change in our government or social structure , but simply reforms in the present system . Their sympathy for radical movements , which has brought them into mistaken disrepute , is based upon a literal interpretation of the Constitution regarding freedom of speech , publication and assembly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But The Nation took the pacifist position against the war .
