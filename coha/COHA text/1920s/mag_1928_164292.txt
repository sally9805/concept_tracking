Since 1562 the 39 Articles of the English Book of Common Prayer have stood , not unassailed , yet unchanged ; and before their establishment the Nicene Creed ; and before that the Creed of the Apostles . They have the . patina of old authority . Have they the beauty of present utility ? More often and more widely the question in present times is being asked and variously answered by Protestant Episcopalians . <P> Last week Dr. Karl Reiland , 55 , learned , attempted an answer by reading , during a vesper service at his St. George 's Protestant Episcopal Church in Manhattan , a new creed which he would like to see accepted : <P> " We believe that God is spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth . <P> " We believe that God hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on the face of the whole earth . <P> " We believe that God is love and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God . <P> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God . <P> " We believe that the Lord Jesus is the way , the truth and the life . <P> " We believe that if we walk in the light , as He is in the light , we have fellowship one with another . <P> " We believe in the grace of our Lord , in the love of God , and in the fellowship of the spirit , Amen .
