" Going to Monte ? Really ? You know it is FRIGHTFULLY pass . " Such has been the comment of smart folk , for several seasons , to anyone who proposed a visit to once smart Monte Carlo . Of course the crowds at the Casino tables have been as large as ever-but unfashionable . What to do ? The families of Blanc , Radziwill , Bonaparte , chief stockholders in the Casino , have been puzzling for some time . They are now trying an experiment : Miss Elsa Maxwell . Miss Maxwell is very large , very mirthful , very well known in the U. S. colony at Paris . There must , naturally , be a number of ladies thereabouts , who , for a consideration , will secure for traveling families of U. S. babbitts an entre of sorts in Paris . Whether Miss Maxwell actually frowns upon this practice would be hard to say . Her entre , at least , is still tolerably smart . She is just the woman , decided the Blancs , the Radziwills , the Bonapartes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right people going there again . Despatches told last week that Miss Maxwell is now in Monte Carlo , at a salary of $50,000 per year , and possessed of a bonus of 400 shares of Casino stock . Officially , it is announced , she will " reorganize Monte Carlo. "
