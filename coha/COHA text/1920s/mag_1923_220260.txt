Monsignor Pietro Fumasoni-Biondi , titular Archbishop of Dioclea and new Apostolic Delegate to the United States , arrived from Rome . He gave the apostolic benediction to the worshippers in St. Patrick 's cathedral last Sunday . <P> During the war Mgr . Fumasoni-Biondi was papal delegate to the East Indies . Japan was one of the " islands " under his charge , and he did much to promote understanding between the Vatican and the Mikado . <P> His functions as papal delegate are purely religious , since the United States has no representative at the Vatican . ( A papal nuncio represents the Holy Father in civil matters at those chancelleries which send representatives to Rome . ) <P> Pope Pius may cause to be built a new wing to the Vatican to house Cardinals who , because of steadily rising rents , can not afford residences suitable to their rank .
