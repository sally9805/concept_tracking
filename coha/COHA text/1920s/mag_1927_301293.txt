When members of the International Chamber of Commerce started for their fourth annual congress in Stockholm last week , there were grand hopes that that organization of practical financiers and businessmen would make definite moves towards smoothing out the international exchange of commodities , of breaking down or at least lowering national tariff walls . <P> The recent World Economic Conference in Geneva had recommended such tariff reductions ( TIME , May 16 , et seq . ) . But that conference had had a political aspect . Members of it had been hog-tied with national aspirations , with unneighborly exasperations . . . . <P> In Stockholm , Sir Alan Garrett Anderson , acting president of the International Chamber of Commerce congress , made an eloquent appeal for tariff reductions : " We generally speak as if someone besides ourselves were responsible for trade barriers , but frankly , must we not admit that we manufacturers and producers of goods sold in all countries , we and the men and women of our employ , are the real force behind the trade barriers ? We producers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards , and trade barriers are the methods we chose . Alas for the futility of human hopes and even interests as we suppose them te be ! . . . As happens to the ship which is too heavily freighted with even the best cargo , our argosy capsized . We all know now that we can have too much of a good thing ; that without foreign trade the nation 's trade , aye , even the nation 's life , languishes . " <P> Cried Professor Gustav Cassel , Swedish economist , with as much emotion : " What is wanted is a general understanding of what is fair in the way of international protection . Say , for instance , we allow 20% or 25% ad valorem tariffs for the protection of living and wage standards . Surely all will agree that tariffs of 50% and 100% are not only unfair to world interests , but are uneconomic . If it costs more than 25% more to manufacture an article at home than abroad , give up making the article and let others make it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most particularly to affirm the emphatic adhesion of the business world to the Geneva Conference regarding those tariff walls and policies which are unduly hampering trade directly or indirectly . It especially associates itself with the statement : ' The Conference declared that . the time had come to put an end to an increase in tariffs and to move in the opposite direction . ' " <P> The International Chamber of Commerce financiers and businessmen at Stockholm had generalized as adroitly as did the politicians in Geneva .
