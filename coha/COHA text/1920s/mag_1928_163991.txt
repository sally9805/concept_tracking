One hundred weary widows completed last week some seven months of funeral rites for their eccentric Lord : His Majesty Samdach Prah Bat Kampucha Sisowath , later King of Cambodia ( TIME , Aug. 22 ) . Because King Sisowath 's little realm on the Gulf of Siam became a French protectorate in 1863 , his seven-months-old corpse was honored , last week , not only by black , flat-faced , wide-mouthed Cambodians , but by French officials whose glossy , narrow-waisted clothes spelled Paris . <P> Through his capital , Phnm-Penh , the body of King Sisowath was borne , last week , in a jewel-studded golden urn , displayed atop a tall , pyramid-like funeral car . At the time of his death , the once straight and stocky King Sisowath , delight of his 100 wives , had been doubled up and forced into the urn . Over him was poured mercury and then a topping of aromatic oils . Previously the Monarch 's eldest son , now King Monivong of Cambodia , had intoned in the dead King 's ear : " May Buddha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RECEIVE YOU ! " <P> The ceremonies of last week were designed to get pickled King Sisowath finally into the presence of that being who appeared on earth as Gau ama ( circa 480 B.C. ) and was deified as the serene , immortal Buddha . <P> Before the funeral car advanced 200 heralds and standard bearers , caparisoned , magnificent . Squealing and rasping followed an immense native orchestra . Next came , lumbering and lurching , a score of royal elephants bearing jewel-studded howdahs . Shielded by the howdah curtains sat King Monivong and others of the blood royal whose stern stomachs easily withstood the motion . As the procession passed , both French and native troops lined the way , saluted the funeral car , and kept the multitude of mourners back . <P> The procession came at last to a funeral pyre , high , mighty and well laid . Round it the hundred widows grouped themselves for a final chorus of wails and lamentations . Slowly , reverently all that remained of Monarch Sisowath was borne to the top of the pyre and there set down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppet of France . His pleasures were slumber , meditation and degustation . Fittingly and honorably he was borne away to Buddha , amid the swelling and sizzling of mercury , and the sweet stench of aromatics.
