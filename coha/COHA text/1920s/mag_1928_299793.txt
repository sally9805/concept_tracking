President Coolidge has cut out his autumn 's work for himself . It is not the Power Trust . He will let that take care of itself or let Secretary West take care of it when the Insurgent Republicans and Democrats bring it to head . It is not Nominee Hoover 's election . He will let the Nominee take care of that unless a fatherly fillip seems necessary in New York or somewhere . It is not the deficit , which is a comparatively simple departmental matter , considering its predicted size ( 94 millions on a total budget of 3.7 billions ) . <P> The President 's self-elected work is the **58;10162;TOOLONG . He wants that treaty ratified as the climax of his Administration-of his Era . <P> The treaty is a speaking solemnly of undisputed things . It is something of a feat to have persuaded so many nations ( 14 of them besides the U. S. ) to speak solemnly in concert about anything . The difficulties in the way of getting such a treaty ratified are : 1 ) Some people object to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the more unreal it is ; 2 ) Some people object on the ground that the more solemn a thing is the more binding it is-the more it may commit the U. S. to an international course beyond the present intent . <P> The obstacle that will be presented by militant objectors to the treaty 's ratification is the cruiser-building bill which was lost in the last session of Congress . Responsible people have said that President Coolidge encouraged that bill 's defeat . They have also said that the cruiser bill would be a good one to trade for the treaty 's ratification . They have said further that President Coolidge foresaw this trading possibility . It will not be hard for President Coolidge to reencourage the cruiser bill . It was recommended by his Secretary of the Navy originally . The combination of a Coolidge cruiser bill , a bill meant for national defense , and a peace treaty meant to make national defence unnecessary is paradoxical but potent . <P> President Coolidge took leave of Wisconsin in three ways : He invited the newsgatherers and photographers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; he arranged for a simple farewell speech on the steps of the high school in Superior ; he fished in the law-immune trout pools of the Pierce Estate every last moment that he could , letting others pack the trunks . <P> President Coolidge told Nominee Hoover that he would help his campaign if and when necessary . Last week to Brule went blind Senator Thomas D. Schall of Minnesota . Senator Schall had said he could approve of neither . Hoover nor Smith for a farmer 's reasons . After seeing the President , Senator Schall said he had never actually opposed Nominee Hoover ; that he would now in fact support him , being convinced of his honesty and ability . <P> President Coolidge received a five-months-old thoroughbred setter puppy , by name " Palo Alto , " as a gift from Claire Wildner , Superior realtor . He was told that that the flecks of color on the dog 's coat were called " ticks . " <P> " Well , " said the President , " that 's not what ticks are at Cedar Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ( Col. ) E. W. Starling and said : " Have this dog ready by winter . I am going down to Kentucky then for some hunting . "
