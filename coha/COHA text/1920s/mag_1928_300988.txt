Proudly announced by the French Government 's new Office Franais du Tourisme in Manhattan was the opening , last week , of a new transAlpine railway linking smart Monte Carlo and Nice directly with Northern Italy , Switzerland , Germany . <P> Until very recently it was understood that the new line would be inaugurated by a handshake across the Franco-Italian frontier between President Gaston Doumergue and Prime Minister Benito Mussolini . That would have been no more than appropriate-for unquestionably this de luxe Riviera route is of greater social importance than the trans-Pyrenean freight line recently opened by the King of Spain and the President of France ( TIME , July 23 ) . Unfortunately relations between France and Italy are just now so tense that at the last minute it was considered wiser to omit the gesture of a nation-to-nation handclasp across the frontier . Therefore M. Le President and Il Duce kept their too potent palms out of contact , last week , but sent their Ministers of Public Works to shake just an ordinary shake . <P> Shaker Giovanni Giuriati is a somewhat insignificant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the ablest , most forthright and least blatantly famed statesmen of France . Deftly M. Tardieu turned his complimentary speech to Signer Giuriati into an inoffensive but significant hint . Italy and France might differ , he said , in their political concepts and in the objects of their foreign policy ; but surely they ought to unite in more and more projects of commercial benefit , such as this railway . " I hail these strong bands of steel , " cried Andr Tardieu in emotional peroration , " as a new and active element in the organization of peace . " <P> Potential travelers to the Riviera who think that they can ask every sort of question about the new route at the French Government 's Office du Tourisme , No. 4 East 52nd St. , Manhattan , may be piqued to discover that certain quaint and prudent conditions are imposed . In an " authorized and official " French Government release it is stated : " Any legitimate questions regarding travel in France , sent to this bureau in good faith will receive quick attention and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand against illegitimate questions about France , asked in bad faith .
