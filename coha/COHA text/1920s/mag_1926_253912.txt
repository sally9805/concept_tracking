One William Ford , storekeeper in the village of Drumcollogher , County Limerick , welcomed to the musty loft of his barn last week a crowd of eager Irish peasants who climbed up the single rickety ladder , sat down in rapt expectance of Drumcollogher 's first cinema show , a drama called The Decoy . <P> The operator , one Patrick Downing , planted his projector on a table in front of the barn-theatre 's only door , ground off one reel of film , another . Then suddenly he screamed-too late-as a spark from a nearby candle fell on a roll of film lying on the table . . . . <P> While hot , hissing celluloid flames cut off the only door , the barn , tinder-dry , kindled with a roar . Forty-nine persons were burned to death in this , the worst cinema-theatre fire in the history of the British Isles . <P> The fire achieved international notice when the Government of Ulster despatched to the Government of the Irish Free State the first message of sympathy and condolence which has ever passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
