The Greek lamp of Monarchism , which has been burning with an ever sicklier flame , went out . The Kingdom of the Hellenes became the Republic of the Hellenes by will of a majority of the people . <P> No details were published concerning the long-promised plebescite which was held during the past week , but the Republican Government made it known that a large majority had voted for a republic . The vote in Athens was 75% in a republic 's favor . <P> The Greek Republic was virtually established when King George II was invited to take a holiday last December ( TIME Dec. 31 ) . It was at first intended , under the Venizelos scheme ( TIME , Jan. 28 ) , to keep the Monarchy until the people should have voted against it and in favor of a republic . The advent of the Republican Papanastasion Cabinet established a de facto republic which has now been legitimized by the people 's will .                    @
