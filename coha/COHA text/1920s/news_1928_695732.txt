txt A tremendous advance throughont. the world was made in the field of chemistry in 1928 ; the volume of chemical research increased ; new laboratories were established and old laboratories improved , it was declared yesterday in a summary of outstanding events made public by the American Chemical Society . Fundamental research as a distinct department , to be maintained almost regardless of business conditions , has been added in at least one industry , according to the report . On the purely commercial side , it is reported that chemistry has provided large returns , as indicated by the published statistics in regard to imports and exports , as well as the volume of manufactured materials , the employment situation in the industry , the capital turnover and the dividends paid . The summary shows that the American Chemical Society enjoyed one of the best years in its history , its membership increasing to nearly 17,000 , making it the world 's largest organization of its kind . More than $500,000 has been added to the society 's funds to enlarge a worldwide system of reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the next five years it Is planned to raise $2,000,000 . Contributions during the year included $250,000 from Francis P. Garvan , head of the Chemical Foundation , Inc. , and $254,050 from 118 industrial firms . " Among the accomplishments of the year , " the summary said , " is the synthesis of sucrose from fructose and glucose by Arne Pictet and Hans Vogel . The tetra-acetate of glucose was combined with the tetra-acetate of gamma fructose . This work , which reveals the structure of sucrose , is without present commercial significance , but is recognized as an important step in organic research , bringing us much nearer to the synthesis of carbohydrates . " In the rapidly developing rayon industry , " the report continues , " one of the most important advances is covered by the Lilienfeld patents . Leon Lilienfeld has found that , by the action of chloracetic acid and aniline on glucose . anilides of cellulose are formed , yielding rayons in the molecules of which nitrogen has been introduced , thus constituting another important step toward protein containing natural silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the summary . saw the commercial realization in Germany of the project of producing motor fuels by the direct hydrogenation of coal , using the Bergius process . Production at the Leuna works was at the rate of 70,000 metric tons per year in 1928 , and this is to be trebled in 1929 , the report says . Another outstanding development in motor fuels , it was said , centred about the investigation in Great Britain of tetraethyl lead . principal constituent of ethyl gasoline . After a round of investigations , in which the House of Lords figured , permission was given to market and use this American anti-knock compound , the summary says . It is declared that synthetic rubber is a problem that has been pushed somewhat nearer to solution but is still far from a commercial success . Amateur motion pictures became a reality when demonstrations were made at the Eastman Kodak Company . An important step was taken in the tanning industry , the report goes on , when the use of methylamine in the tannery became a commercial possibilityThe summary points to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in loud speakers of unusual power for outdoor use , and in many details connected with radio . Many of these have depended upon materials supplied through the research laboratories , where chemists work side by side with physicists and with engineers .
