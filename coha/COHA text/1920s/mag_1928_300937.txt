At Marion , Ill. , Catholics , ever fraternal , were drawn closer to each other one day last week . " Did you hear what happened last night ? " they asked each other . Some person or persons-the police could not say who-had set a bomb on the basement steps of the church . It went off , ripped the basement steps , shattered windows , scattered suspicion . <P> <P> At 13th Street near Sixth Avenue , Manhattan , John Markle , anthracite tycoon , helped Commander Evangeline Booth , of the Salvation Army , with a bit of digging , then turned , spade in hand , to acknowledge the cheers of many a Salvation Army cadet . Ground had been broken for the $500,000 John &; Mary Markle residence-hotel for businesswomen . Said Henry Waters Taft , second youngest of the four Taft brothers and chairman of the Salvation Army Advisory Board : " He gives twice who gives quickly . . . he gives thrice who gives meekly . " <P> <P> In 1816 Dona Petronila de Guzman made her will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repose of her soul . Dona Petronila , a Filipino , died four years later . A chaplaincy to see to the celebration of the masses was provided for . but has been vacant and the income has gone to the care of the Archbishop of Manila . One Paul Rogerio Gonzalez , kin of Dona Petronila , seeks now to recover $86,862.50 , alleged income of the chaplaincy between 1911 and 1925 . The Supreme Court of the U. S. will decide . <P> <P> From the Roman Catholic Bishop of Nashville , Tenn. , last week came a strange suggestion to the nuns of his diocese . " Do n't vote , " he said in effect . His reason : the obvious hostile comment upon nuns ' voting would be that they were helping to swell the Smith vote total and that the Church was massed for Smith ; this he wished to avoid . <P> <P> The sermons of Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick usually are preached from his pulpit in the Park Avenue Baptist Church , Manhattan . He preaches to packed houses ; it therefore is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admittance to the church proper the following instructions have been issued : attend the service in the men 's auditorium , hear Dr. Fosdick 's voice through an amplifier ; sign a blank and receive a ticket for admission to the church proper on the following Sunday . <P> <P> In Glasgow , Scotland , the Students ' Union was a bedlam . The air was filled with tobacco smoke , flying playing-cards , the words and music of a slightly ribald chant , " Oh , Aimee , dear Aimee , we all love you so ! " Hung in the hall were signs : GOOD OLD WHISKEY ! LADIES MAY SMOKE ! SCOTCH WHISKEY IS GOOD FOR ALL COMPLEXIONS ! Vitreous vessels , onetime containers of whiskey , stout , champagne , were in idle profusion-all dedicated to the embarrassment of Aimee Semple McPherson , notorious evangelist who inadvertently had chosen university election time to speak to the studentry . Pitifully , persistently she tried to make herself heard above the heckling din . Only when she said , " Let us pray , " did the studentry bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer came to Amen the divine interlude ended : smoke was blown in the McPherson 's face and to it was offered many a beer mug .
