Half a million persons , transported by boats , motor cars , trains and airplanes , gathered last week around the Aintree racing course , shadowed by the murk of Liverpool . They watched 16 horses charge , as though in a Cossack attack , at the start of the Grand National Steeplechase . Horses stumbled . Horses straddled hedges . Horses fell into ditches . Ten reached the finish line at the end 856 yards . Leading them was one the name of which the half-million scarcely knew-a 100 to 1 shot , owned by a woman , ridden by a former sailor-Gregalach II , a chestnut gelding . <P> Americans owned eleven of the horses which made the first charge . Among them was the favorite , Easter Hero , 9 to 1 , from the stable of John Hay ( " Jock " ) Whitney . Easter Hero carried 175 pounds . Shortly after the start he swung gracefully into the lead . Over Becher 's Brook , over Valentine 's Brook , around the treacherous canal turn he swung , taking the leaps with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure victory . But the turf was soggy from two days of rain . The field crept closer and closer . At the last hedge but one , Easter Hero and Gregalach jumped together . When they landed Gregalach was ahead . He kept the lead across the final barrier to win by six lengths . Far behind staggered Richmond II to finish third . <P> Meantime U.S. citizens in the stands , and there were many , had been straining their eyes for the silks of Billy Barton , the only U.S.-bred horse in the race . For a time he had raced well . Then , at the nineteenth jump-a rail obstacle , a difficult hedge and a ditch-he faltered and fell . Tommy Cullinan , thrown , jumped up and remounted . But Billy Barton was through . He fell again and with this fall went a small fortune , including a single bet of $50,000 . <P> The winner had not been mentioned among the possibilities before the race . He is a half-brother of Easter Hero . He cost his owner , Mrs. M. A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and carried a prize of $65,000 . Mrs. Gemmell saw little of the race herself . She is small and was wedged into the huge crowd so tightly she could hardly turn her head .
