Within 90 days , responsible men stated last week , definite plans will be submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission for consolidation of the Great Northern Railroad and the Northern Pacific Railroad . These two roads already own 97% of the Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy Railroad ( the Burlington ) . + So it is probable that the Commission will also , later , consider this line officially joining the others . Thus the longest railroad system in North America will evolve - longer than the Canadian ' Pacific ( 20,000 miles ) , the New York Central ( 14,537 miles ) , the Southern Pacific ( 13,000 miles ) and the Pennsylvania ( 11,698 miles ) . It will include 28,300 miles ; will represent a capital investment of $650,000,000 and a valuation of $1,500,000,000 . <P> The will behind this consolidation is that of Arthur Curtiss James , largest owner of railroad securities in this country . He dominates , but does not control , affairs of Northern Pacific , of Great Northern and of Burlington . <P> These , together with the Colorado &; Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Hill " roads that James Jerome ( " Empire builder " ) Hill ( 1838-1916 ) developed . Now , with the Western Pacific which connects the Burlington directly to San Francisco and in which Mr. James bought controlling interest last summer ( TIME , June 21 ) , they are more aptly called " James " roads . The Hill descendants have never become active financially . <P> When he acquired his Western Pacific holdings , Mr. James stated that the investment was " purely personal , " meaning that he was not representing his other companies , but only himself . Nevertheless , a still further consolidation of western transportation was not invisible , if the Interstate Commerce Commission should approve Mr. James 's present plan . A web connecting west and midwest by north and south is already dominated , and might well be directed , by this financier who , though never a railroad man , can sit in his office and evolve plans " to build up the territory " as readily as he would take a trick at the helm of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relieve the finances of one of his many religious charities . <P> +lmportant cities in the district are : Chicago , Milwaukee , Minneapolis , St. Paul , Kansas City , Omaha , Des Moines , Butte , Spokane , Seattle , Tacoma.
