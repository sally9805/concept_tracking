The theory behind the Luxembourg museum is typical of the logical French mind . Praises of living artists are forever reverberating in the cafes and studios of France . But these hallelujahs , often fanatical in intensity , are usually ignored by bland , potent French critics . These priests of the Louvre are too wise to ballyhoo any skyrocketing dauber who happens to be the vogue . But occasionally the critical pundits suspect a novice of immortality . When this happens they have a routine gesture of generosity . They hang his pictures in the Luxembourg . For a minimum of ten years the pictures generally stay there . Thousands see them , thousands talk about them , the pundits study them . Only the work of genius can survive this bitter ordeal by familiarity . At length the enduring works are borne with punditical hosannas to the Louvre . The rest descend in devious channels to oblivion . <P> Last week a Ministerial decree announced the imminent transfer of the Luxembourg collection of Impressionist &; Post-Impressionist art to the Louvre . For all of the painters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Luxembourg outlasted their lives . They had tried to paint what they perceived as current realities . Often they were frustrated , tortured in the patient attempts to convey the actualities of their vision . But they believed in an art stimulated by the living , not the dead . For this they were excoriated by a host of pompous academicians , who applauded apes of the classical tradition . <P> Thus last week 's decree was a major triumph for vitality as opposed to senescence . For although Impressionist painting is included in private collections at the Louvre it has never been received in great quantities . <P> Henceforth the Louvre will spaciously exhibit : <P> The garish Tahitian fantasies of Paul Gauguin . He found the soft woods and streams of Brittany an exhausted subject . He lived , painted and died in the South Seas , where sunlight bursts like bombshells on labyrinthine foliage , showers lustrous patterns on voluptuous dark flesh . <P> The iridescent landscapes of Vincent van Gogh , madman . When he had no brushes he squirted paint from his color tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lopped off one of his own ears , sent it in an envelope to a bordello . He died by his own hand . <P> The gigantesque floral graces of Auguste Renoir whose canvases are glowing bouquets of drapery , decoration , tinted flesh . <P> The hard honesties of Paul Czanne . Most scrupulous of painters , he lived like an eremite , relentlessly purged his optic sense of all illusion , all imaginative invention . Fearing dishonesty he painted , repainted , erased everything and painted again . <P> The vibrant , airy landscapes of Claude Monet , worshipper of sunlight , rapt student of motes , beams , the subtle tones of shadows . More than any other man , Monet epitomizes the impressionist movement , the realization that perceptual reality is not composed of insulated objects each of characteristic colors , but is rather a play of shapes at once defined and related by the one blazing spectrum of the sun . <P> <P> * Conservative criticism might lead ignorant laymen to believe that impressionists &; post-impressionists are frenzied young anarchists .
