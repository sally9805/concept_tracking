At the Waldorf Astoria , monumental Manhattan hotel , celebrated for its dignity and its cuisine , there was seen last week the annual exhibition of pictures fostered by the Society of Independent Artists , who are notorious for their lack of dignity , their poor taste , and the total inexclusiveness of their membership . But the Independent Artists shows are noted also for their originality and the excitement they cause among untutored art patrons . The exhibition is often referred to as a " circus " or a " rodeo " by such stubbornly facetious reporters as are sent , instead of art critics , to report the affair for newspapers . To exhibit an object of art under the auspices of this nonjury , non-prize-awarding organization , it is only necessary that the manufacturer of the object pay $8 to cover , presumably , the rent of wall-space . Hence many absurd trophies of the endless hunt for ideas are hung along the Waldorf wainscots and many able artists also , who quite naturally dislike submitting their efforts to unsympathetic juries , send excellent work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as usual , the show came in like a mad March lion . It was noted that two themes had preoccupied the attention of many of the most absurd artists ; one was Death , the other was Colonel Charles Augustus Lindbergh . Novel materials for expressing alleged thoughts were few in number ; the most noteworthy was a three dimensional drawing , or skeleton sculpture , of a she-wolf giving suck to two small boys . The lines of the she-wolf 's body were indicated in copper wire ; her mammary glands were represented by door stops . Of the other exhibits a few may be briefly described as follows : <P> Soul , by Muriel Haskell , is an entirely ludicrous pattern , attempting to present , in its melee of prongs and beams and curlycues , an allegory as trite , as uninteresting and as unconvincing as the metaphors in a schoolboy 's sonnet . <P> Navesink Lights , by Adelaide Morris , is a shiny landscape , containing a bathing pavilion , bridge , hill , road , river , castle , and autocar , cleverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now vastly popular in Germany . <P> President Calles , by Luis Hidalgo , famed Mexican caricaturist , was a most grossly insulting and funny portrait of this famed statesman . Hidalgo 's faunlike Lindy showed the aviator riding a ridiculous horse around the world . <P> Ferdinand Cartier drew a pen and ink picture of the Rockefeller Institute , in Manhattan . There was nothing very remarkable about his drawing , except that it was composed of more than 500,000 minute pen lines . <P> John Sloan , Robert Henri , James Montgomery Flagg , famed all of them for worthy and comparatively orthodox works , the latter for his flashy magazine illustrations , allowed themselves to be represented among the Independents . <P> In Riverside Drive , Kikuta Nakagawa , one of the many Japanese artists who display their jocose and oriental sneers in the Independents ' salon , neatly portrayed a grotesque fat woman walking on the path and leading by the hand a little child who was , one could presume , one of many .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
