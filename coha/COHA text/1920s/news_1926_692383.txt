txt C. F. Kelley , president of Anaconda Copper Mining Co. and chairman of the committee of the copper producers that has been considering formation of a new and more comprehensive copper export association , states : " A prclimirrary conference , in which most of the copper proaucers interested in foreign markets have I participated , has resulted in the drafting of a plan for the formation of an export association under the provision of the Webb-Pomerene law . The drafts have been submitted to counsel of the respective companies for study . " It is understood that practically all the American producers , including representatives of the custom smelting companies , and some of the foreign operators have been sitting in at the meetings , discussing the details of the new- export association . Outlook is quite promising for its final formation under the Webb-Pomerene act and for its being much I more comprehensive than ever was the old Copper Export Association from which some of the principal pro-clueing companies withdrew about two years ago . It probably will be several weeks before final gigna-1 tures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable to the government . It has become evident from the price of copper during tire last two years that a greater coordination in foreign selling is necessary if copper producers are to get a fair price . Notwithstanding that for over two years world 's consumption has been greater than world production , price of copper - ic- craged only 1314 cents a pound delivered in 1924 and in 1923 l414. cents . Average price for 10 years prior to the war was about 15 cents a pound delivered . Present price is 1414 to 14% cents delivered , and only ( ten days ago was 14 cents . Such an export association as is being considers will be of the greatest benefit to both the consuming and the producing ends of the industry . Formation o ? such an association should result in the stabilization of the price of =ppm  --  at-a level fair to both consumer and prodticer . It should be possible with such an association to get an average price of 15,4. to 1514 cents delivered this year . With such a price , fully 30% more copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it is economical to save with p:ce of copper averaging less than 14 cents a pound as it has for the last five years . There is an excellent prospect of the copper industry 's finally taking this effect , ve step that will assur- , stockholders in copper companies earnings somewhe-o commensurate with the capital investment and the risks involved .
