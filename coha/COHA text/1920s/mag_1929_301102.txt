In the crowd of spectators at last week 's Senate Lobby Committee hearings sat one inconspicuous man intently following every word of testimony , taking many a note . No professional newsgatherer , he was reporting the investigation for a special client . Inmmediately after each day 's hearings a comprehensive report of what had transpired swiftly found its way into the White House and upon the President 's desk . <P> What accounted for President Hoover 's particular interest in this Congressional investigation was the manner in which his name had been bandied about by the Cuban Sugar Lobby , directed by Herbert Conrad Lakin . Lobbyist Lakin had hired as the Lobby 's Lawyer Edwin Paul Shattuck , because Mr. Shattuck was a Hoover friend , had done legal work for the President , such as drawing leases . This connection Lobbyist Lakin had so magnified in widely scattered letters as to create the impression that President Hoover was cooperating with the sugar lobby . Excerpts from the letters of Lobbyist Lakin : <P> " President Hoover has instructed his Secretary , Mr. Newton , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ourselves . . . . We are a little doubtful about this step . . . but of course would do what President Hoover desires as he seems to be genuinely interested in our cause . . . . <P> " President Hoover sent for Mr. Shattuck and suggested that Shattuck cooperate with the Ways &; Means Committee . . . . <P> " This week we received a proposal from the White House which we have been studying . . . . " <P> Feebly Lobbyist Lakin admitted that his information was mostly hearsay , that he had never really investigated Mr. Shattuck 's connections with President Hoover . He conceded that his use of the President 's name might have been " injudicious . " <P> Hot with indignation , Lobby-Lawyer Shattuck took the witness stand , emphatically declared : <P> " I make no claim to be the legal adviser of Mr. Hoover . I have done professional work for him , but it was of no great importance . I resent the implication that I am Mr. Hoover 's closest legal friend . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I have never discussed the sugar tariff with Mr. Hoover . I have discussed the sliding scale with Mr. Newton . . . . Some people might think that what Mr. Newton said was the same as what the President said . . . . I have never received any directions from Mr. Hoover . . . . You must realize that this is all very embarrassing to me . . . . " <P> " Yes , and to President Hoover , too , " interposed lobby-chasing Senator Robinson . <P> The next day another Lakin letter , written to Mr. Shattuck himself , was turned up by the Committee . <P> " Just before we last went to Cuba you had an interview with President Hoover . You understood him to approve of Cuban newspaper criticism against the sugar tariff . I enclose two editorials . . . I think ought to be called to the attention of the White House . " <P> Many a political ear last week was cocked toward the White House , expecting President Hoover to say something to blast the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House silence longer , Congressman John Nance Garner of Texas , House Democratic leader , finally blurted out a demand :
