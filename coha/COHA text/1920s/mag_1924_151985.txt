George Bernard Shaw arose , last week , before a gathering of Art students in London . Said he : " The King of England is obliged to go to the Goodwood races , to the football cup ties and to shake hands with the players . But he is not expected to go to the Royal Academy . It would be a nine days ' sensation if he made a practice of shaking hands with artists . "
