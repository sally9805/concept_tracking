txt For as long as their co-workers could recollect last night , John Joyce , 5730 South Green street , and Steve Noble , 5115 South Francisco avenue , had been friends and fellow workers in the by-products plant of Armour &; Co. in the Union stock yards . Electricians by trade , they were working partners as usual yesterday when a disabled dynamo needed repair . Noble , who was 51 years old , had stretched out under the flywheel while Joyce , 11 years younger , was tinkering with the brushes on the main shaft above . Steve Does n't Answer . " Steve , pass me up a flle , " said Joyce , but his friend made no answer . Ills right hand had brushed a loaded connection . He died without uttering a sound . Joyce 's face was deathly pale under the grime as he stood among the knot of workmen who had bared their heads . The foreman noting his condition , told him to see the company doctor . Starts Back to Work . " There , that 'll fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after administering a bracer for the man 's shaken nerves . Joyce smiled wanly as he left the Infirmary and started back to the plant , two blocks away . Halt way he began to reel and fell with his hand pressed over his eyes , as if to shut out the vision of his comrade 's end . When the workmen found him , Joyce too was dead .
