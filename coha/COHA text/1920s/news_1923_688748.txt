txt An Egyptian service portraying the worship of Amen-Ra and Aten as a preparation for Christianity , " was held yesterday afternoon at St. Mark'sin-the-Bouwerie . The service was prepared from the religious writings of ancient Egypt and included the reading of a cento from " The Gospel of Osiris , " which gives a character portrayal of Queen Isis. , who is sometimes referred to as a prototype of the Virgin Mary . Following the usual opening of an Episcopal service , curtains were drawn , concealing the altar , and the Rev. William Norman Guthrie led the congregation in a responsive chant to Aten , the heretical god set up by Klau-n-aten , . father-in-law of Tut-ankh-Amen . " Hail to thee , beautiful God of every day ! Beautiful is thy arising in the horizon of the sky , " read Dr. Guthrie . " Beautiful is thine arising . 0 living Atom Orb of Light , 0 first beginning of life ! When thou arisest in the eastern horizon thou fillest every land with thy beauty , " replied the people . " Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole earth  --  Thou art Ra , the Sun-God , and thou carriest all away captive . Thou bindest them fast with thy love . " A short silence followed the chant , then at the word from Dr. Guthrie the congregation kneeled and began a prayer of adoration to Amen-Ra , " the God of Heaven . " " Lanterns Cast Rainbow Hues . From the old ceiling of St. Mark 's the huge lanterns cast rainbow hues upon the kneeling congregation . Lights of green , blue , red and amber shades played here and there in the church as the monotonous tones of the ancient ritual wei'e repeated . A single white light . high above the altar , shone upon Dr. Guthrie as he addressed the ancient God . /rile playing of a harp accompanied the prayer . A distant rumble of a crosstown car and the occasional heavy breathing of a member of the congregation were the only sounds to interrupt the service . In many ways the scene resembled that of a vast cave dimly illuminated by the colors of the spectrum . " Hail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lord of the thrones of the earth , Ancient of Days , Lord of the Ages , Upstayer of things that are , Foremost of the Gods , Lord of truth and righteousness . Begetter of the Gods . Maker of men and beasts and herbs . " At the conclusion of the . prayer a cento prepared from the " The Gospel of Osiris " was read ' from the pulpit by Miss Sydney Thompson . This gave the mystical legend of Isis and Osiris , to which writers , seeking recourse to pagan mythology to account for Christian tradition , often connect with the virgin birth . In " Ancient Egypt , the Light of the World , " Gerald Massey also compares the myth of Queen Isis with the New Testament story of the raising of Lazarus from the dead . The Story of Osiris . The cento tells of the love of King Osiris " and his sister-wife , Isis , who with her magic power as an enchantress protected him from harm . One day while he was on a journey , away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " fell upon him and slew him . " When Isis hears of the murder she begins a journey in search of the body with her sister , Nephthys . They find the dead body of the king and Isis in her lamentations cries unto heaven for vengeance . Her prayers are heard and a son , Horus . Is born . Horus is greatly feared by his uncle , Set , who has usurped the throne , as he hears tha. : the boy will avenge his father 's death . Set sends a scorpion to the place where the child is hidden and it stings him to death . Isis is stricken with bitter grief and . gain appeals to Ra , who expels the Itcorplon 's poison from the body of the boy , and he is restored to life . The child and his mother go to the tomb of Osiris and he , too , is raised from the dead . This , is the incident connected by Massey with the raising of Lazarus . The history of Osiris . apart from its religious aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods . They often enacted the scene of his murder as a sort of miracle play . The grief of Isis appealed to the popular imagination , and the recital ? of her woes often filled a part of the festival in commemoration of Osiris , which took place in December . " The object of the service . " said Dr. Guthrie last night , " in common with our other studies of comparative religion , is to draw upon the past treasures of spiritual experience and arrange them in harmony with our own religion . The effort is to make the people feel the unity of religion . If there is one God , it is obvious that at different times there should be the same expressions of religious feeling . In the Egyptian service I wished to make an emotional rather than an intellectual comparison . I think the service shows that the people of all ages were making preparation for Christianity . Their confessions of faith were in many ways very aprii. lar to Qurs. "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
