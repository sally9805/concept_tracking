Rasputin is a Russian nickname meaning the " Debauchee . " For twelve years the Black Monk , Gregory Novihh , famed as Rasputin , dominated the Tsaritsa Alexandra , and through her swayed Tsar Nicholas the Last , * and through him warped the destiny of All the Russias . <P> Today Prince Felix Youssoupov , one of a patriotic group of Russian noblemen who slew Rasputin in 1916 , is being sued at Paris for 25,000,000 francs ( $1,000,000 ) damages , by the Black Monk 's surviving daughter , Mme. Boris Soloviev , once Mlle. Matrona Novihh ( TIME , June 25 ) . <P> Last week Mme. Soloviev told Paris correspondents , for the first time , about the night of Dec. 30 , 1916 , when her father went to meet Death . <P> Debauchee or Staretz ? " My father had his defects , like everyone else , " said Monk Rasputin 's daughter , " but he was a good father and a good man . He was a staretz , a man inspired by God . I carry his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youssoupov was to my father apparently one of his dearest friends . He often came to our house in Petrograd . That evening in 1916 , which was to be his last , my father said to me : <P> " ' Felix is coming to get me . You must tell nobody about it . I am to go to his house incognito to a reception that he and the Grand Duke Dimitri have organized for me . ' <P> " At midnight they came . Youssoupov was admitted by the servants ' stairway . He embraced my father , crying : ' Ah , my dear friend , ' and took him away . " <P> " When my father did not return the next morning I telephoned the Prince . He assured me that he did not know where my father could be . I then telephoned the Tsaritsa Alexandra . She sent a carriage to get me . <P> " My sister and I were taken to the Palace of Tsarskoe-Selo into the presence of the Tsaritsa . She told me that my father had met a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful counselor , the man in whom she had put all her confidence . <P> " She did not weep . She looked at us with an expression of infinite tenderness and sadness . I did not then know all that had happened . <P> " I was to know one other grief . Two years ago , here in Paris , Boris , my husband , died in the Cochin Hospital of exhaustion and privation . But my two children and I are well . And I have work ... " <P> " My suit for damages against Prince Felix Youssoupov and the Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich both resident in Paris is not primarily a struggle for money . It is an effort to clear my slandered father 's name ! " <P> Slayer 's Boast . Prince Felix Youssoupov has written autobiographically that he offered Rasputin poisoned wine , after first pretending to take a sip himself . When the Debauchee 's potent digestion resisted liquid poison , Rasputin was induced to eat several pastries containing cyanide of potassium . Expectantly the nobles waited for their victim to collapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was believed to possess occult powers , became merely hilarious after absorbing enough poison to kill a healthy elephant . <P> Prince Youssoupov boasts that he finally drew a revolver and put shot after shot into Rasputin . Even then the period before Death came was so appallingly long that the Grand Duke Dimitri is said to have rewound a phonograph 20 times in an effort to keep up the morale of all concerned . He later remarked with a shudder :
