THE DECLINE OF THE WEST-Vol . II-Perspectives of World History-Oswald Spengler-Translated from the German by Charles Francis Atkinson-Knopf ( $7.50 ) . <P> Beset by doubts , historical philosophers base their theories on one certitude . Civilizations are never static . They are always in motion , creatively toward stronger outpourings of their spirit or destructively toward decay and dissolution . Thus Western civilization , with its vaulting expression in Gothic cathedrals , Beethoven , da Vinci , Einstein , Manhattan 's sun-smitten towers , is either seething onward toward mightier transactions , more luminous cultural &; scientific manifestations , or suffering the nervous , senile disintegration which desolated Rome , Egypt , ancient China . <P> H. G. Wells and Bertrand Russell , seeing everywhere harbingers of Western obsolescence , nevertheless resist this unpleasant evidence with faith in the perpetual constructive force of human will &; intellect . Oswald Spengler of Munich scorns such precarious optimism as only another instance of the pathetic pride which Romans , Egyptians and Orientals felt at the height of their refulgence . <P> Spengler is historian , mathematician , esthete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powerful alternation of Teutonic intellectual despotism and entranced mysticism , he analyzes history by huge analogies . Civilizations he sees as emerging &; disappearing in cycles , each one , like a flower , experiencing birth , growth , decay , death . Our own Western civilization he declares to be in the phase of decay , characterized by material expansion , effete spirituality . Collapse is imminent in perhaps 300 years . But by that time another human group will be unwittingly generating a new civilization to flourish and sink in its own long turn . Herein lies the refutation of the charge of pessimism applied to Spengler by lesser minds . Regarding civilizations as organisms , he is no more the pessimist than any man who recognizes the transient nature of all organic life . <P> When the first volume of The Decline of the West appeared in Germany a few years ago , thousands of copies were sold . Cultivated European discourse quickly became Spengler-saturated . Spenglerism spurted from the pens of countless disciples . It was imperative to read Spengler , to sympathize or revolt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kinship of plants , animals , men , parallels of law , cities &; cultures , languages , religions , ethics &; morals , stimulates further astonishment and elation . These are fruits of contact with perhaps the most colossal mind of our age , a mind which forces wondrous patterns on the chaos of history , which perceives equally stirring significances in Greek , the French revolution , a Byzantine mosaic .
