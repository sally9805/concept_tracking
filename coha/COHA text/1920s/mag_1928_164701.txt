" They knowingly misled French justice ! The role of these Americans was blameworthy and reprehensible . " Thus intoned M. le Juge Adolphe Wattine of the First Civil Tribunal of Paris , last week . He had just rebuked and suspended three French divorce lawyers-Maitres Moreau , Legrand and Prestal-and was now warming up to flay their U. S. divorce clients and especially those U.S. lawyers who act in Paris as inter-mediaires between would-be-divorcees and the French avocats who alone may argue cases before the Paris Bar . Roundly naming names , Judge Wattine mentioned Dudley Field Malone , onetime Collector of the Port of New York , Benjamin H. Conner , President of the American Chamber of Commerce at Paris , and a half dozen more expatriate U. S. lawyers as especial objects of his wrath . As a first and most vital precaution Registrar Chipot of the Civil Court was placed on trial , last week , before all the 119 Magistrates entitled to sit upon that high tribunal . Registrar Chipot is entitled to charge 10 francs ( 40 ) for " handling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accepting as much as 20 or even 25 francs ( 80 or $1 ) as an illegal fee or bribe for " expediting " the papers . Piteously M. Le Registrar Chipot plead that when the franc declined to one fourth its pre-War value , " it became customary for us poor registrars to accept whatever fees were offered . " The 119 judges , touched by this appeal , suspended Registrar Chipot for two months only , then adjusted his suspension to fall exactly within the two months annual vacation of the Court , at which time the Registrar has no duties and no opportunity to earn fees , take bribes .
