In Berlin it is sometimes popularly supposed that the titanic rivals in U. S. finance are J. P. Morgan &; Co. and Dillon , Read &; Co . Last week , pink-cheeked , socialistic , optimistic Finance Minister Rudolf Hilfer ding found himself short of cash for year-end budget requirements . He hastily sought to arrange an $100,000,000 loan with Dillon , Read &; Co. by cable . <P> For several days the wires hummed merrily about millions . Then suddenly jovial Dr. Hilferding was jerked up short by brusque Dr. Hjalmar Schacht , President of the Reichsbank . A watchman of Germany 's cash drawer , Dr. Schacht barked that he would not O.K. the loan . Scareheads in the Berlin press screamed that Dr. Hilferding would have to resign because now his budget would not balance . There were predictions that the Cabinet was due to fall . <P> Dr. Schacht , having upset the applecart , set about picking up the apples . Within 24 hours he announced that he ( i.e. , the Reichsbank ) would supply the needed cash . The political neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have passed off as a teapot-tempest , except for the famed Berliner Tageblatt whose editor announced that he possessed the inside story , upset the apples again . <P> Reminding its readers that J. P. Morgan &; Co. will launch the long awaited German Reparations Bonds , soon after the Young Plan comes into effect ( TIME , June 10 , et seq . ) , Tageblatt intimated that should Dillon , Read beat their " rivals " to the Stock Exchange with an $100,000,000 German loan , subsequent Morgan pickings from Reparations Bonds might verge upon the loan . According to the " dope " Dr. Schacht was persuaded to obstruct the loan by Seymour Parker Gilbert , whose post as Agent General of Reparations will automatically be abolished when the Young Plan comes into effect . For years Germans have been hearing that Mr. Gilbert will then become a Morgan partner . <P> In Manhattan , the Herald Tribune , generally the first recipient ' of Morgan news for the daily press , broadened and mellowed the Tageblatt story thus : " Confirmation could not be obtained for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. S'chacht 's advances to the German government by short term credits to be granted with J. P. Morgan &; Co . It was understood that no negotiations for such a-deal had been opened . " <P> Finance Minister Hilferding did not survive this second upset . Over the weekend he resigned , took with him his right hand man , State Secretary Johannes Popitz . President Paul von Hindenburg scratched his grizzled poll , appointed Minister of Economics Paul Moldenhauer to be Temporary . Minister of Finance . <P> Earlier in the week Dr. Schacht intervened in negotiations by the City of Berlin with Dillon , Read &; Co. for a $14,400,000 loan , squashed it . Berlin understands " that the City was about to hire the money from Dillon , Read for 8.6% , that Dr. Schacht offered to supply it from the Reichybank for 7%.
