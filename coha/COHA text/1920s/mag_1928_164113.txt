The story of the enlargement of Christianity is the story of men moving , thinking things , telling things ; always essentially the story of the men who went out from Jerusalem after they had seen Christ die and disappear . This Easter , almost as if the twist of centuries had reversed the lines of force around Jerusalem , the men who are carrying Christianity into the corners of the world were drawn back to Palestine . Two hundred delegates , spokesmen for powerful Christian forces in 51 countries , gathered in Jerusalem for the International Missionary Council ( TIME , April 2 ) . <P> Francis John McConnell , Methodist Episcopal Bishop of Pittsburgh , stated a postulate that would surprise and shock all sturdy U. S. Fundamentalists : " I come from a Nation which is in some respects pagan . We subscribe to the doctrine of militarism and to the god of materialism , and we have given ourselves over to the pursuit of wealth . We should not be complacent regarding paganism . . . . Let this meeting become a challenge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Economics at the University of London , replied to Bishop McConnell by voicing an even more damaging criticism of contemporary Christianity : " I can not share the complacency of those who talk about all the good things we have to offer backward peoples , when we can not point out a single country in Europe where there is a real Christian civilization operating throughout its society . . . . We are trying the impossible in offering to save the individual , yet leaving the social structure pagan . ... It is not possible for men and women to accept one standard of social ethics in private life and another in economic life . . . . " <P> Bishop McConnell became specific : " It 's not the business of the Church to say how technical changes shall be made , but when we see mills in China where American-made investments are earning 100% we may as well raise the question . ... " <P> When the Committee on Christian Unity and Industrial Problems , headed by Bishop McConnell , presented their 5,000-word report , it was adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obligation of the governments of economically advanced countries to make certain that less advanced peoples were protected from social injustice , and that they share the fruits of economic progress . Further , the report suggested that public loans , to be used in undeveloped areas , be made only with the knowledge and approval of the League of Nations , and subject to the provisions which it prescribes . . . . <P> The effect of Christianity upon temporal and economic matters was by no means the only matter upon which notable opinions were advanced : <P> Solemn and deep-voiced Professor Jabavu , of the South African Native College , pointed out that in his country , while there are five blacks to one white , 88% of educational funds are spent on whites . The Rev. Dr. Charles Pugh , who had come from the Congo Free State , said that in the rural districts there were thousands of people who could read , but that they had no books . <P> Surendria Datta , of the National Christian Council of India , asserted that Christianity and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and would remain there even if British rule were removed .
