On the eve of his party 's convention , Mr. Coolidge summoned the business organization of the government , sang the swansong of a prudent housekeeper . Something less than a paean , his main theme was in a major key : " I have rejoiced in keeping down the budget . Since July 1 , 1921 , debt reduction amounts to $6,327,000,000 ... a saving in interest of $950,000,000 . . . . The tide of the good fortune . . . seems not yet to have reached its flood . We take pride in our unparalleled prosperity . In July , 1921 , more than 5,700,000 people were without work . . . at the present time the number is not much more than 1,800,000 . Manufacturing . . . one-third higher than in 1927 . . . . Iron and steel production more than twice as large . . . . Mining industries active . " <P> Minor keys obtruded : " States , counties , municipalities , increased their cost ( 1921-25 ) by $3,500,000,000 . This steady increase in governmental cost on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity , can not be ignored , will not correct itself . . . . Another adverse tendency is ... speculation . " <P> The difference between the U. S. fiscally in 1921 and fiscally in 1928 is the principal Coolidge pride , and the principal Republican point in election debate . But neither pride nor point arises from the 1928-29 estimates which were , of course , the business of this particular budget meeting . <P> Therefore , masterfully , the President said : " Taking into consideration the legislation enacted during the last session of the Congress , we find that for 1929 our receipts will be about $3,707,000,000 and our estimated expenditures $3,801,000,000 . These estimates might seem to forecast a deficit . " Insupportable thought , to be quickly dismissed by the prestige of a Presidential first person : " I do not face the coming year with any thought that we will not balance the budget . This nation is committed irrevocably to balancing the budget . " <P> How is this to be accomplished ? By strictest economy , by the tireless picking and pecking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arose , therefore , General Lord , hoarder of pennies , good storyteller . Said he : " Are we disturbed ? Well , perhaps disturbed , but not discouraged . Down , but not out . We accept the challenge . . . . Expenditure will be kept inside revenue , no matter what the decrease in revenue may be . " General Lord stared the deficit in the face , recalled the black days of 1919 : " In certain localities it is the custom to refer to the year of the big snow or the great flood . ... I think our Treasury will always refer to 1919 as the year of the big debt and big deficit " ( debt , $26,596,701,648.01 ; deficit , $13,370,637,568.60 ) . But happier days are at hand : ( estimated debt , June 30 , 1928 , $17,650,000,000 ; surplus , 1927 , $635,809,921.70 ) .
