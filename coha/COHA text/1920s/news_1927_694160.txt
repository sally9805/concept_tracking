txt The application for an injunction to restrain the city from carrying out the award of a bus franchise for Manhattan , Brooklyn and Queens to the Equitable Coach Company and to prevent Mayor Walker from signing the franchise voted by the Board of Estimate , brought by Stewart Browne , President of the United Real Estate Owners ' Association , was denied yesterday by Supreme Court Justice Curtis ' A. Peters . Immediately ' after receiving word officially of Justice  --  Peters 's decision , Mayor Walker signed the franchise at 3:30 o'clock in his office at City Hall . The Mayor several days ago signed the contracts for the Surface Trans. portation Corporation , a stibsidiary of the Third Avenue Railway Company , for the bus franchise in the Bronx and . of the Tompkins Bus Corporation for the bus franchise in Richmond , so he departs for Europe with the bus matter seemingly settled so far as he can settle It . Serves Notice of Appeal. , Although Mayor Walker had signed the franchise contract , Mr. Browne said last night that he intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notice of appeal on the Corporation Counsel . " We did not receive notice of the decision until after 3:30 , the time at which I am informed Mayor Walker i signed the franchise , " Mr. Browne said . " We will ask the Court for a stay in the morning . I suppose the Mayor by signing the franchise contract has complicated matters . 1 am not.enough of a lawyer to say . " Individual routes in the franchise granted to the Equitable Comnany are still subject to attack before the Transit Commission in the hearing on the application which the company will have to make for certificates of convenience and necessity , and it is understood that the B. M. T. will attack certain routes in Brooklyn on the ground that they would compete with existing surface lines . Justice Peters held that Mr. Browne had failed to prove his charge that Mayor Walker had denied a public hearing on the Equitable Company 's amended application for a franchise and said the preponderance of the evidence was that the Mayor had not , as alleged by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar in " a low tone of voice . " Justice Peters also ruled that Mr. Browne had failed to prove that the offer of the Equitable Company was less favorable to the city , than the offers of Other companies , and that in any event he had not made any charge of fraud against the Mayor and other city officials , who were vested with a certain amount of discretion . Quotes Secretary 's Report . Justice Peters quoted the testimony of the secretary of the Board of Estimate to support his decision that the Mayor had denied a public hearing on the Equitable Company 's application . " The secretary of the Board of Estimate has sworn in an affidavit , " Justice Peters said in his opinion , " that the following is a correct tran- script of the stenographic minutes of said board on July 28 , 1927 , in respect to calendar item No. 14 . No. ** on the form of contract for the grant of a franchise to the Equitable Coach Company , Inc. , to establish , maintain and operate a bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons and property upon certain crosstown routes in the Borough of Manhattan and upon certain routes in the Borough of Brooklyn and Queens , all as more particularly described in said contract . The Mayor : The Chair asks unanimous consent to consider out of its regular order No. 14 . Is there objection ? The clerk read the proposition . The Mayor : The Chair moves the adoption of No. 14 . Is there objection ? If not , call the roll . The Clerk : Hearing closed . ( The clerk called the roll . ) Says No One Objected . " The vote was thereupon taken adopting the resolution , " Justice Peters continued . " The stenographic minutes of the board show , therefore , that the Mayor . called for a consideration of the resolution in question ; that the proposition was read ; that the Mayor moved its adoption and asked if there was any objection . So far as the record shows , no one objected to the proposition or to the granting of the franchise , whereupon the hearing was closed and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provisions of the Charter above quoted were complied with , for there was held a public hearing thereon , at which citizens were entitled to appear and be heard . No one asked to be heard . " Upon the hearing of this motion the only evidence submitted by the plaintiff to controvert the official record was an affidavit by himself wherein he stated that the Mayor in a low voice uttered the words No. 14 , which was the item number of the Equitable Coach Company 's petition for a franchise ; and without even a moment 's pause and before any one could get on his feet the Mayor immediately moved a resolution for the acceptance of the Equitable Coach Company 's petition and quickly ordered the clerk to call the roll ; that the clerk called the roll of the members present and the Mayor hurriedly declared it carried . " Counsel for the plaintiff upon this motion admitted that plaintiff suffered an impairment in his hearing and that fact is borne out by a letter to the Mayor dated Jan. 7 , 1926 , attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Board of Transportation for the City of New York , who was present at the time , in an affidavit denies , as does the Mayor in his affidavit , that the Mayor spoke in a low tone of voice during the proceeding and states that the Mayor requested consideration of the item in a tone so that all might hear ; that no one appeared to talk on the subject of item No. 14 and the Mayor thereupon requested a roll-call . Did Not Ask to Be Heard . " All the affidavits agree that the proposed resolution was called up for consideration by the Mayor publicly , and there is no affidavit before the court that any one present in the chamber protested or objected to this particular resolution or asked to be beard thereon . There is not even an affidavit from any one to the effect that he desired to be heard on the resolution and was prevented by the Mayor or any one from being heard . Even the plaintiff in his affidavit does not claim that he asked to be heard , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record before me I find that the proof submitted by the plaintiff is not sufficient to overcome the presumption that the public officials concerned performed their duty and held the hearing provided for by law . The stenographer 's record of the proceedings support that presurnption . The plaintiff has not , therefore , shown that the action of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment in ' dopting the resolution granting the franchise in question was illegal . " Justice Peters also held that the plaintiff has not proved his contention under Section 51 of the general municipal law that the board 's action in " waste " the franchise had caused ' waste " or " injury " to the city , particularly as there was no charge of fraud , collusion or bad faith made by Mr. Browne . " In fact , upon oral argument , " Justice Peters continued , " counsel for the plaintiff expressly held that no fraud was charged against the Mayor . " Justice Peters also held that Mr. Browne had failed to prove that the terms offered to the city by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , and showed that the Equitable Company guaranteed the city a minimum of $400,000 a year return for the three boroughs , while its three campetitors , each bidding for a franchise in one borough , made offers which ag gregated only $390,000 a year as the minimum return . He added that refusal of the offer of the unsuccessful petitioner for the Manhattan bus franchise to pay 50 per cent . of any net profit after a return of 8 per cent . did not indicate bad faith on the part of the Board of Estimate because there would be no evidence that there would be any such profits to divide . No Evidence of Fraud . In summing up his findings . Justice Peters said : " The Board of Estimate and Apportionment acted , among other things , upon the reports of the Board of Transportation of the city , which investigated the questions of the fare to be charged , the service to be rendered , the transfer facilities , the financial ability of the companies and the compensation to be paid to the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , acting in a legislative capacity , has granted these franchises . There is no charge of fraud or bad faith or collusion on the part of the members of said board contained in the complaint therein and there is no evidence before the Court of fraud or bad faith or collusion . The Court therefore is without power to interfere in any way with the granting of these franchises . " The application for the injunction sought is therefore denied , with $10 costs .
