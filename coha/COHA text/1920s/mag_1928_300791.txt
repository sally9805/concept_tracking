" Looking back I was stunned to see the rear engine enveloped in flames , which even as I looked , stretched out like a giant blowlamp rearwards over the seat occupied by Elwood Hosmer and beyond the rudder and tail . In the darkness the whole machine must have appeared like a grotesque red comet . The whole situation seemed like a nightmare and quite unreal . Even now I find it difficult to realize we were in a blazing airplane over mid-Atlantic at midnight . . . seemed impossible to put down safely in the dark on a burning seaplane which still had a ton overload . As I drew out of the dive I saw the glow reflected on the wave crests . I managed to put the machine down on one crest , ran down a hill of water , up the next hill , and just prevented the machine from shooting into the air off the next crest . " <P> Frank T. Courtney , British trans-Atlantic flight aspirant , had enough cause for perturbation ; must have felt bedeviled . His 1,500-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles northwest of Horta , happy starting point in the Azores . He and his companions waited during 15 minutes of flames for an explosion that never came . Heavy seas extinguished the fire which had gutted the engine room . Heavy seas tossed the Dornier-Napier and its passengers for the next twelve hours . They tried smoke signals which almost re-ignited the craft , sent by radio S. 0 . S. , false position and corrected position signals , grew seasick . All wireless resources spanning the Atlantic came into play . Twelve steamships altered or considered altering their courses for rescue purposes . In the meantime Courtney pondered the almost indefatigable jinx which has attended his flying career ( TIME , July 18 , 27 ) . At length radio-operator Gilmour said he saw a ship . " Liar , " remarked Courtney , near-defeatist . <P> He had not taken one factor into account . Frank H. Claret is captain of the Atlantic Transport liner Minnewaska . He is as jovial and popular a skipper as is to be found on the high seas . On his account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was the youngest of 18 children , ran away to sea at the age of 13 , and during his motley career has supervised the tiller of every sort of craft . But Captain Claret 's capability , his geniality and prowess as a raconteur do not constitute a complete estimate of the man . There is linked with him some apparently metaphysical Baedeker which directs him wherever the fates most joyfully convene . During the War he was on the bridge of the transport Minnehaha when it was torpedoed off the Irish coast . The ship sank so rapidly that it literally shot out from under its Captain 's feet . He calmly swam about , assisted twelve wallowing survivors into lifeboats . Then , through long grey hours he bobbed about in icy water , blowing air from his huge lungs into a leaky life preserver , until finally he heard the drawl of a familiar voice , " Oh I say , Claret , is that you ? " The voice was in command of a British destroyer which rescued the almost expiring Claret .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
