The Moscow government has not yet made any statement as to how it will spend the credits accruing from the huge sales of grain . No country has reported a Bolshevik order for agricultural tools or for cattle , which would be the only justification that they could plead for depriving their unfortunate citizens of their daily bread . On the other hand , the Bolsheviki are very busy talking about war and explaining to the world the significance of the Ruhr , Memel , Vilna . At the fifth anniversary of the formation of the Red Army , Trotzky , Minister of War , said : " We want peace , but nobody knows when the bad intentions of our enemies will compel us to get into the field . " They ridicule France 's attitude with regard to the Ruhr and spare no opportunity to cover that nation with caustic criticism . They have informed the Allies that they will accept no settlement of the Memel question unless they are consulted , holding that the port of Memel is of vital interest to Russian trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia openly accuses France of stirring up trouble by lending the Poles $25,000,000 . It is a notorious fact that the government is spending great sums upon Communist propaganda abroad , in Ireland , for example . They seem more concerned with the world 's affairs and the propagation of Bolshevik policy than in looking after their own people .
