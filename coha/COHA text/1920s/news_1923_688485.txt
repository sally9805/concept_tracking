txt The Past Year . To the Editor of The New York Times : Civilization intended to make us all better , more gentle and less material , but has not done its perfect work in the year past . Even here at its centre there are people savage and brutal and without consideration for others . Commerce and business are supposed " to feed the hungry and clothe the naked " and fill the world with prosperity and peace , but the grafter and profiteer get in their work , hinder the beneficent work of business and commerce and make the hungry hungrier , the poor poorer and the middle class angry by high prices and poor goods . Even prohibition is not perfect . It is meant to make a man , or a nation . " healthy , wealthy and wise . " but some say " it makes me sick , " others " it makes me poor at 5100 a case , " and still others " it makes cowards of us all . " What shall we say to these things ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not one , " or that " all men are liars " ? Or shall we say " take it all in all , spite of wars , petty statesmanship , greed and selfishness , this old world is becoming a new world " 7 We.believe that 1923 will make a vast stride into a better and brighter civilization . JAMES T. CHALMERS . New York . Dec. 31. 1922.
