txt Accomplishment of a long step in the improvement of the diplomatic and consular service of the United States is probable before the adjournment of the present session of Congress . The Rogers bill for the reorganization and improvement of-the foreign service already has been passed by the House . Sentiment among the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee shows thz.t the chances for an early and favorable report of the measure to the Senate are good The chances of favorable Senate action also are good ' and President Coolidge already has indicated that he will sign the bill . However , - the biggest fear of the friends of the Rogers bill is that overconfidence may result in its falling by the wayside . This happened last session when the measure was caught in the legislative jam at the close of the session , and so failed to pass even though there was no serious opposition from any quarter . If business men , who have shown a decided interest in the bill , will make their interest known to Congress at this time , the chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legislation now before Congress .

By granting representation allowances which will lessen . but probably not wholly eliminate , the drain on the private means of American ambassadors . By creating a retirement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present a consul general of Class I draws $12.000 a year . The counselor of an embassy , which is the corresponding grade in the diplomatic service , draws $4,000 a year . This very disparity in pay has prevented any interchange between the two services . Interchange is desirable . Very often consular officials would be very valuable to the diplomatic corps and vice versa . Ambassadors and ministers are compelled to live in a certain style and do a certain amount of entertaining . It is not a question of whether or not they want to , for they must . At present they must do this on a meager salary and then draw on their private means . The Rogers hill establishes representation allowances , the amount of which would he controlled through appropriations . The annuity fund would he made up by assessing members of the foreign service 5 of their salaries . It is estimated that for 20 or 2:1 years the fund would be self-sustaining .
