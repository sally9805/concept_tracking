Often of late in Washington has been heard the phrase , " New Patriots . " President Hoover coined it himself to apply to the potent citizens he was drawing into Federal service . To these men he explains that they are patriots because each of them makes a " personal sacrifice " to accept appointment . The " sacrifice " meant by the President in most cases is a heavy loss of income , plus the presumptive inconvenience if not discomfort of leaving home to visit or live in Washington . <P> The President is extremely proud of his " New Patriots " and of his ability to win their services for the U. S. In nearly every case his appeal to them is patriotic : they would make any sacrifice for their country at war ; they should feel the same in peacetime . <P> Chief among the " New Patriots " are : <P> Earl D. Church , who gave up a $50,000 per year insurance job to become Commissioner of Pensions at $9,000 . <P> Julius Klein , who refused handsome salary offers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $9,000 . <P> Joseph Potter Cotton , who gave up a $100,000 per year Manhattan law practice to be Under-Secretary of State at $10,000 . <P> Charles James Rhoads , who shelved his lucrative partnership in Brown Bros . &; Co. to take the $8,000 Commissionership of Indian Affairs . <P> Ernest Lee Jahncke , who left a remunerative ship-building and drydock business to serve as Assistant Secretary of the Navy at $9,000 . <P> Also : David Sinton Ingalls , Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Aeronautics ; Patrick Jay Hurley , Assistant Secretary of War ; Frederic A. Tilton , Third Assistant Postmaster General ; Charles Evans Hughes Jr. , Solicitor-General , et al . <P> To a type of newspaper feature-writers in Washington known to other newsmen as " the butter brigade , " the " New Patriots " are food and drink . Upon " New Patriot " careers these journalistic biographers seize to produce Sunday " human interest " articles , in which the " New Patriot " is extolled out of all bounds , his " sacrifice " overemphasized , his Federal service gilded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Legge to leave the $100,000 presidency of International Harvester Co. and serve as chairman of the Federal Farm Board at $12,000 . Before the " butter brigade " could have at Mr. Legge 's " sacrifice " and career , trenchant Frank R. Kent of the Baltimore Sun , an arch-Democrat except where President Hoover is concerned , wrote in " The Great Game of Politics , " his daily column , as follows : <P> " Having beautifully buttered on successive Sundays the members of the Hoover Cabinet and practically all the assistant secretaries , they the ' butter brigade ' are now down to the lower levels reduced to dramatizing the wives of the more conspicuous official figures . Soon , if something does not happen , they will get to their sweethearts . In this critical situation the new Farm Board is a great help . It will bring to Washington a group of new men , each of whom will be available for a nice buttery article . <P> " Particularly will the selection of Alexander H. Legge . . . be a help . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
