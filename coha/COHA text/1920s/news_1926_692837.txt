txt A message from President Coolidge emphasizing that morality and religion are the basis of government was read tonight at a civic welcome in the historic Coliseum extended to John Cardinal Bonzano , Papal Legate , and the eight other Cardinals who are here for the opening of the International Eucharistic Congress . More than 12,000 persons were jammed into the big auditorium , which was ' smothered in flags from the floor to the lofty roof . About 5.000 others were wedged in the streets outside , following the speakers and the musical program through amplifiers . When the Legate and his fellow-Cardinals , escorted by Cardinal Mundelein of Chicago , entered and took places on the platform they received an ovation . The meeting was undenominational and prominent men and women of all faiths were scattered through the audience . Secretary of Labor James J. Davis , who read the President 's message , spoke later for the Federal Government . Governor Len . Small expressed the welcome of the State of Illinois . Mayor William a Dever spoke formally for the City : of Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-Catholics , while D. F. Kelly . Knight Commander of the Knights of St. Gregory , paid the tribute of the Catholic laity . Ten Cardinals Sit In a Line . The Papal Legate and the nine Cardinals were seated in a line at the very edge of the platform . Lights beating down upon them intensified the gorgeousness of their flowing scarlet robes and struck flashing glints from the jeweled crosses which hung from their necks . Cardinal Bonzano was seated in the middle of the vivid line , while back of it were placed the Archbishops and the Bishops , their deep-toned purple cassocks making an effective contrast . Yet another blaze of contrasting shade and hue was furnished by the Monsignori , row on row , chiefly elderly men , in robes of black edged with brilliant purple . Out from the churchmen extended a vast sea of faces , men , women and children  --  the children lifted to see the dignitaries of their . hunch ? that stretched from the platform to the very doors of the Coliseum . The gallery was packed as never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by seventy-five Musicians from the orchestra of the Chicago Opera Company , which preceded the opening of the meeting , the Legate sat watching the crowds , a smile upon his face . He turned several times to Cardinal Czernoch of Hungary , who sat at his right , and obviously commented on the great crowd . As the speakers made their points applause roared out time and time again , but for none was the applause greater than when Secretary Davis said : " Any prejudice existing in America against Catholics comes from people who make a specialty of prejudice , and , like all countries , we have a few . " The Papal Legate followed the addresses intently and at the end of ; each he shook hands with the speaker . His fellow-Cardinals often joined in the approbation that came thundering frog ' all parts of the auditorium . Text of Coolidge 's Letter .

It is reported to me that this will probably be one of the largest religious gatherings of recent days held in America . Our country has long been under the imputation of putting ' too much emphasis on material things . Perhaps we have been the subject of that kind of criticism , not so much because we are really more interested in material prosperity than others , but because in that direction we have been more successful than others . But , no doubt a most conclusive answer to such criticism lies in the fact that material prosperity can not be secured unless it rests upon spiritual realities . It is impossible to create a commercial system which is not built on credit , confidence and faith . Without the elements of honor and honesty there can be no economic advance . If the requirements of character be withdrawn from our business structure , the whole fabric would collapse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the despot has passed . No country attempts to rely on force , but on reason to justify its institutions . No Government can long endure unless its people are convinced that it is a righteous Government . If our country has achieved any political ' success . if our people are attached to the Constitution , it is because our institutions are in harmony with their religious beliefs . It is for these reasons that the religious life of the nation is so important . Its free exercise is guaranteed by the fundamental law of the land . If America is advancing economically , if it is the abiding place of justice and freedom , it is because of the deep religious convictions of its people . Very cordially yours , CALVIN COOLIDGE . To his Eminence . George Cardinal Mundelein Archbishop of Chicago , Chicago , 111 . ' Papal Legate Expresses Thanks . At the close of the speeches the Legate walked slowly to the edge of the platform and expressed not only his own thanks but the gratitude of Pope Pius XI . He praised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the congress , and at the close of his address he bestowed a special blessing from the Pontiff upon the gathering . Preceding the official welcome , an elaborate musical program was rendered while 2a0 ushers worked strenuously to guide the thousands to their seats . The Paulist Choir of New York , composed of 100 voices , sent the majestic notes of sacred music welling through the great structure , so often the scene of bitter fights at political conventions . Simple faith , simply expressed , held sway in the auditorium where Roosevelt , Taft and Harding were nominated and where a fourth President , Mr. Coolidge , was designated to make the race for Vice President . In presenting Mr. Insull as the first speaker Commander Kelly referred to the fact that he appeared fonlie denominations outside of the Catholic fold . Insult Speaks for Protestants . " It is indeed a privilege , " said Mr. Insull.

" This interesting occasion . and the events of ensuing days which it in ' aueurates. should be be an inspiration to all of us who live in Chicago , as it is a challenge to our hospitality . " Men and women of all creeds and of all points of view can not fail to be impressed by the circumstances . Multitudes are assembling here from the ends of the earth . As human beings , they are widely diversified in language , in customs and in all racial characteristics . But they are gathering under one banner and for one common purpose  --  to give public ' testimony to their belief in a fundamental tenet of their religion . " It is an impressive demonstration of mankind 's ability to surmount net'oral as well as artificial barriers , and to act voluntarily in harmony , in response to the urge of a fixed conviction . " In the selection of Chicago for this demonstration of religious devotion , there may be more than casual or superficial significance . " By reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of its development , our city especially typifies the purely industrial and commercial forces that now play so large a part in human affairs . Industry and commerce have their place , along with the benign influence of religious teaching - and the cultural effects of art and literature , in the promotion of civilization . as the word civilization is commonly interpreted in this twentieth century . Influences of Trade and Religion . " Men and peoples now become acquainted - with one another largely by ' trading with one another . Acquaintance , when leavened with the sincere application of religious teaching , is the open door to mutual understanding , toleration and respect ; and through that door lies the way to friendship and harmonious association among men and peoples alike . Results from a conjunction of those influences are to he seen nowhere more clearly than here . " Our distinguished guest and his distinguished colleagues would not be among us on the mission that has drawn them together if industry and commerce had not built here this youngest among the great metropolitan centres of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forget its origin . We do not forget what has been contributed by the forces which his Eminence Cardinal Bonzano personally and in his official capacity represents . " To find the beginnings of this occasion we turn back the pages of history for two centuries and a half .. There we find the imperishable record of the gentle Father Marquette and of those of his faith who followed him , and who carried the cross through the wilderness that has become this seat of empire . " Those heroic souls were the pathfinders . They marked the trails and set up the guide posts . They planted the seeds of friendliness . of order . of right conduct , of respect for the rights of property , that , no matter what vicissitudes may seem to have attended the flowering and the fruition , have , been nevertheless factors in all that has come after . Thus opened to tlfel civilization of the white man , the ' . great Mississippi Valley has offered ' full play to all the forces that make for progress in this age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results speak for themselves . In evaluating these results it is apparent that the spiritual needs of men 's nature have not been subordinated here to material concern . Everywhere among us the church , the school , the library , the art museum and the university are neighbors to the agencies of industry and commerce . " It is a Christian people that inhab- , its this inland empire , of which Chicago is the visible expression . It is a friendly and mutually understanding people , although compounded of elements drawn from all nations , with each element contributing its due share to the composite results . Sonie or all of these circumstances , no doubt . were iit the ' mind of our esteemed fellow citizen his Eminence Cardinal Mundelein when he conceived the great undertaking that is inaugurated here tonight .

I believe , the people of Chicago and of this great Mississippi Valley are joined with us here in all that is implied by this welcome to his Eminence Cardinal Bonzano and his distinguished colleagues . " Dever Offers Freedom of City . Mayor Dever , after a personal tribute to the Legate , gave the freedom of the city to the distinguished visitors . " Civil government in America , " he said , " and indeed throughout the world , is beholden to Christian principles , Indeed . every worthy step in the march of modern civilization is the outgrowth , or the application of some Christian principle ; nor is that all that we owe to Christianity . The reign of law , the maintenance of order , the control of crime , and even temporal progress , all are due in largest part to the application of Christian principles . I do not say that this is due to the Catholic religion alone . because the fundamentals of law and order have come down to us from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demlogue of Moses . " Consider our condition without religion  --  organized religion . Your Eminence , the burdens of government , even under the most favorable circumstances are onerous . Thinking- men , I am sure , will agree with nfe when I say that , uninfluenced by religion , civil Government could not endure . Should some event or circumstance , inconceivable I grant . overthrow or obliterate religion , civil government would collapse . " As a citizen , I attribute whatever measure of success has been attained by us to the spirit of Christian virtue and the spirit Of Christian rectitude which influence so many of our people , and by application of which so ninny difficult problems are solvable . " Your extraordinary mission to preside in the name and place of our Holy Father over the Eucharistic Congress is ' of such transcendent importance that we find it difficult of comprener ? sion . There has been nothing in our experienced to which this event may be likened .

Accepting the splendid achievements of the past as an augury of the future , we earnestly pray for the long life and continued health and happiness of our Cardinal . " I can not forego this opportunity to say a word of welcome to alt visitors attendant upon this congress . We are greatly pleased and highly honored by your presence , and it is our hope that your pleasure and comfort may become the care of all our citizens .

" Governor Expresses Welcome . - Governor Small said that the State had been honored in the selection of the meeting place of'the congress . Continuing his brier address , he added : is my great privilege and pleasure to offer you , on tile part of the people of Illinois , a nearty welcome to our State , not as to a stranger within our gates , but as to a distinguished and valued friend who has returned to America to renew his pleasant relations with us . It is my fervent wish that the congress over which you are called to preside may bring forth a revival and strengenentng Or religious interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our nation but in all the Christian nations a the world . " I trust your visit may be made beautiful by the enthusiasm and ' devotion of all those who participate in the celebration , and , when the time comes to say farewell , that you may take with you happy memories of your sojourn among us and a consciousness of a great work well and nobly done . " Davis Speaks for the Republic , Secretary Davis read the President 's letter before delivering his own address . He also extended the official welcome of the Republic to the prelates and to the thousands of foreign delegates . He spoke In part as follows : " When a million souls from all parts of the world leave their homes and vocations behind them for the purpose of making a pilgrimage of the extraordinary character which is now being witnessed in this city . it is proof , if proof be needed , that religion is neither dead nor moribund in the heart of man . The zeal that has brought you to this city on Lake Michigan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ als1 who roamed far and wide in search- of the Holy Grail , and those who forgot all their petty self-interests and made sacrifices of no mean order to rescue the Holy Sepulchre from the Saracen . " We often hear it said in America that the present age is one of unbridled materialism and worldliness . This gathering lea demonstration that the light of faith that burned so bright in the Middle Ages is still burning with no diminution of its lustre . The faith that built the wonderful cathedrals of Europe and the Medieval universities which instructed the old and middle-aged as well as the young , the faith that inspired St. Francis and Dante and made the thirteenth century so illustrious ire the annals of mankind , is no less vital now than it was in those far-off days . Spiritual Birth of America . " We are not oblivious in America of the spiritual side of existence . America was settled by men to whom spiritual things meant more than the things of purely material import . " The Puritans , who founded Massachusetts in the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland in the South , came to the New World that they might be permitted to worship God in accordance with their own conscience . America was founded.by men who wished to see the will of God prevail in the world , and a religious people Americans have been ever since the days of the early settlements . " It gives me great pleasure , in addressing this Catholic audience . to call attention to the fact that the members of your communion who settled in Maryland share with Roger Williams , the founder of Rhode Island and Providence plantations , in the honor of being the first - American settlers to establish the principles of religious toleration . The Catholics of Maryland respected the conscience of all men and women in that Province . They allowed the men , and women of the various Protestant persuasions the same liberty that they asked for themselves . The student of history of religious freedom in America knows that in according toleration to all faiths the Catholics of America , in the one original colony that was settled by them , built a monument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of bronze or marble . Catholic Record in America , " Catholics have reason to be proud Of the growth of their faith in America . From humble beginnings the Church has grown by leaps and bounds until today it has nearly 19,000,000 communicants . Many of the leading citizens of our country today are of your faith . They are graduates of our universities . They are to be found in editorial chairs ; they are leaders in the arts and sciences ; many are illustrious men of letters ; they have taken an eminent rank in the professions and in business . Catholics are found in our halls of legislation and upon the bench . Two of their number have been Chief Justices of the Supreme Court . " On every field of battle in welch America has engaged they have shed their blood in behalf of the land of their birth , or the land of their adoption , and on more than one hotly contested field a Catholic General has led the Americans arms . The patriotism of our Catholic citizens is not open to dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , It comes from persons who make a specialty of prejudice . and , like all other countries , we have a few who do , ? ? ? " There are elements among us , as in other lands , which are so dissatisfied with life , or rather with the life that they know from experience , that they desire to destroy our American institutions . Those advocates of revolution are men who abhor all religion and believe neither in God nor the life eternal , " They are materialists against whom all who believe in the validity of spiritual ideals must set a face like flint . The Catholic Church has stood like a wall of adamant against the vicious revolutionary procedures of this class . which are urged ostensibly in behalf of labor but Which really owe their origin in the will of a few to power . Whatever a man 's religious faith may be , if he have one . he can have ho intellectual commerce with this type of revolutionist . " Allow me to congratulate you heartily on the great success ef this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a purely religious celebration has ever been seen in America before , and its intim.ence is destined . to be profound . It was on your part a great spiritual adventure , I presume , that the majority of those who have come front foreign lands are now viewing America for the first time , and I trust that when you return to your homes . it will be to carry as pleasing a recollection of the people of the New World as we shall be certain to entertain of you . " As Secretary Davis ended his speech Mr. Kelly arose and in the course of the laity 's greeting to the Legate asked that he tell the Pope of the great accomplishments of Cardinal Mundelein in the archdiocese . Text of Bonzano 's Reply . The text of the Legate 's reply was ' as follows : " Your Excellency , your Honor , Most Eminent Cardinale and distinguished prelates : " Although not a stranger to the people of Chicago , having assisted at a number of great events in your city , I have no claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this occasion ; nor do I look on this testimonial as a tribute to myself . " At this time . in the name of his Holiness , Pius XI , in the name of Cardinal Mundelein , and in the name of all the Catholics of the world , from the depths of my grateful soul , I thank your Excellency , your Honor , and through you the other officials of the State and city , and your fellow-citizens , for this expression of esteem , which will gladden the heart of the Sovereign Pontiff. that venerable man to ' whom more than three hundred thillidris of people look with venera'ion as to a father and teacher . " In return for this generous tribute of honor , my wish is that God , your Father and Mine , will reward the citizens of ' this State and city , arid in particular all who have worked so hard for the success of this Congress , a thousandfold in health , happiness and prosperity . " You cart best appreciate the iihportance-of this Congress , yourselves , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your city have been deeply stirred in preparation for it . To this I can add that not only have the people of Chicago and America experienced an overpowering sentiment stimulating their hearts , bet the whole Christian world has experienced a like thrill and urge . They seem to have caught something of the ' I will ' spirit of Chicago , which has ' prompted her citizens to plan every detail for the most stupendous religious gathering this Western World ever has known . " This remarkable output of dynamic endeavor is only in keeping with Chicago 's record Of growth and development from a town of 4,000 inhabitants 100 years ago to the second largest city of the nation . Nor has this progress , as some may believe , been confined to making your city the grain and lumber market of the world , . the greatest railroad centre , to say nothing of the packing industry , but it likewise includes the realization in a very high degree , of intellectual and cultural aims . Pays Tribute to Education . " From a booklet setting forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its universities enroll nearly 50,000 students and that $50,000 , - 000 is expended annually fot the education of the children in your public schools . To this must be added the contribution of private organizations , that of the Catholics and a number of others who build and maintain their own schools , in which they educate almost half as many children as attend the public schools . ? " The reason for this self-imposed burden was expressed by President Coolidge , the illustrious Chief Executive of your nation , some months ago when he said : " ' An intellectual growth will only act toward confusion unless it is accomplished by a moral growth . I do not know of any source of moral power than that which comes from religion . The utmost ingenuity on the part of police powers will be substantial , but wasted in an effort to enforce the law . if there does not exist a strong and vigorous determination on the part of the people to observe the law . ' " It is plain , then , from the words of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as isnowledge , to be essential to good government . And it must be most gratifying to the citizens of this great and glorious republic to recognize in these words of your President the same ideas and sentiments that inspired the founders of the nation when they caused to be impressed upon the Currency of the country , as an everlasting reminder , the words ' In God we trust . ' " Now , it is to honor God , to know whom the Catholics ' and others in this City annually spend millions of dollars , that enormous crowds are coming to Chicago these days . He Explains the Congress . " This extraordinary manifestation of faith , reverence and love for Goel in the Holy Eucharist Is the- love and attachment of the child to its Father , Of the creature to its Creator , of fallen man to ' his Redeemer . It is no mere outburst of enthusiasm . No mr.

' Gal . xi:20 . " These words of St. Paul explain what for so many outside of the Catho , lie Church seems to be a mystery , It is Christ received in the Blessed Sacrament and living in the Catholic that prompts him to make the sacrifices that he does in order that his children May know Jesus , who said : ' I ' am come that you may have life , and may have it more abundantly . ' Jolm : M. ? " The Blessed Sacrament , then , is the source of undying life in the Catholic Church .
