When a quizzical child pops a question which Teacher can not answer , Teacher may frankly admit ignorance and , helpfully , find an answer . Or , if Teacher is lazy , or cunning , or suspicious of the pupil 's motive , or enthusiastic about youthful initiative , he may say : " You find out and tell me . " <P> Gilbert Smith , 13-year-old eighth grader of Somerville , N. J. , got so interested in history class one day lately that he asked his teacher the following question : <P> " If the French Ambassador at Washington was murdered by the English Ambassador , what country would have jurisdiction ? " <P> Gilbert Smith 's teacher was either unwilling or unable to reply . So Gilbert asked his parents . Then he asked the County Judge . Finally , he wrote to the Department of Justice in Washington . <P> The reply which Gilbert Smith received last week from Washington brought him no nearer the truth . If not in fact evasive , it was a reply which waived the question and offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " My dear Mr. Smith : <P> " If I were you I do n't think I would occupy myself with the question which you suggest . If you will study the Constitution in a more general way you will get more out of it than presenting such queries as those you present . <P> " Sincerely yours , <P> " William H. Taft . " <P> One answer given to Gilbert Smith 's question is : Great Britain . <P> The British Ambassador would go home , either peaceably or deported by the U. S. after his Government had shorn him of diplomatic rank . Home , he would face British Justice , famed for speed .
