txt The Department of Justice 's program for safeguarding mail trains and maintaininG interstate commerce during the railroad shopmen 's strike was laid before President Harding for his approval by Attorney General Daugherty this morning Before going to the White House Mr. Daugherty was in conference with Alfred P. Thom , general counsel for the Association of Railroad Executises , for over an hour . In addition he was acquainted with messages from railroad executives to the Post Office Department complaining that mail trains had been held up by strikers on the lookout for strike-breakers . " After investigation and upon request of Federal Judges , District Attorneys and United States Marshals , " said the Attorney General , " I have in the last few days authorized the appointment of a number of Deputy United States Marshals at various places from Chicago , West and Southwest , to protect property and life and to prevent interference with the transportation of the mall and interstate commerce . " This policy will be continued wherever justified and . required . Law and order must be preserved and property and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfered with and interstate commerce must not be interrupted . The President has been fully advised and has the situation fully in hand . " Mall Trains Cut Off . Disorders and interference with mail trains by striking railroad men have resulted in several appeals to the Government to afford protection . Serious charges of interference and assault and , in one case of forcible seizure of railroad employes , have Caused the Post Office Department to lay the complaints before President Harding and Attorney General Daugherty . Passenger trains carrying mails have been discontinued in some instances . The most serious complaint received by the Post Office Department came in a telegram sent yesterday from St. Louis , by President J. E. Taussig of the Wabash Railroad Company . Post Office Inspectors have been sent to the points where Mr. Taussig says there has been interference with the mails . In his message Mr. Taussig says , that he has wired the Governor of Missouri twice about interference with the operation of railroad trains " but so far he has not afforded protection . " Mr. Taussig Suggests that United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains . Attorney General Daugherty has been notified of this suggestion and the attention of President Harding directed to the failure of the Governor of Missouri to act . According to telegrams to the Superintendent of the Railway Mail Service at Fort Worth , Texas , twenty-six trains have been withdrawn on different branches of the M. , K. &; T ? Railroad . All of them are railway Post Office trains with the exception of two , which carry closed pouches . Z. V. Rawls , Attorney for Pamlico County , North Carolina , telegraphed the Post Office Department from Bayboro this afternoon that the Norfolk &; Western Railroad Company had discontinued two ' passenger trains from Newbern to Oriental and that the mail service was completely paralyzed . A large portion of the mail , Mr. Rawls said , must be held over in Newborn from sixteen to forty hours , and mall on the Oriental section must lie over from twenty-four to forty-eight hours . Mr. Rawls requested a prompt investigation and Post Office officials at Newbern and Oriental have been directed by the Post Office Department to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two places , thirty miles apart . The serious interference with the mails complained of by President Taussig of the Wabash was set forth in a long telerram , addressed to the Postmaster General . " . About 9 o'clock last night ( Saturday ) , " says President Taussig , " strikers It Moberly , Mo . where one of our divisienishops is located , , surrounded our mail train operating between Kansas City and Detroit , stopped the train , cut the air hose and threw rocks through the windows . " We had eighteen employes who were being sent from Kansas City , , Mo. , to Peru , Ind. , on this tra : .. The strikers forcibly took , these men off the train and took them to the Labor Hull . " We also have had bona fide officers of the company at Hannibal , Mo. , in order to take care of our engines at that point for the purpose of protecting passengers and mall trains . The strikers have so interfered with these officers In their work that they are unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines in that roundhouse that have been put out of service . " The interference at both of these points , unless we have some immediate protection , will oblige us to discontinue operation of these mall trains , and rbelieve the case at Moberly is sufficient to warrant immediate protection . " I have wired the Governor of Um State twice about similar situation , but so far he has not afforded protection . Have also wired him in regard No in.1 case . The Federal Judges in this dlstriet will not be available until ' Thursday . - From the above it would seem Ulat it is necessary that the Department of Justice Immediately authorize the appointment of Deputy United States Marshals to protect the movement of . United States mail trains . " Interference with the Texas &; Pacifie Railroad 's mail train No. 22 , running from Marshall , Texas , to New Orleans , is repornd by Inspector-in-Charge Robinson of New Orleans .
