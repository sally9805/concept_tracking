FOR four months half a hundred workmen at the corners of Thirty-second and Thirty-third Streets and Park Avenue in New York City have been tearing down an old temple ? a temple of hospitality , the old Park Avenue Hotel . The old temple was filled with sentiment and surrounded by traditions , in so far as two or three American generations can hallow a temple . In January of 1927 , after four months ' work , the temple had been reduced to a sort of ground plan of its ruins . It looked like Pompeii . In the midst of the ruins two great machines , somehow reminding one of sentient beings , sank their great tusks into the earth , biting out huge steel basketloads of brick and dust , boards and stone , scrap iron and mortar . The steel beasts , swishing their plumy steam tails into the cool winter air , bummed their eternal work song . The workmen , scurrying about the debris , were busy with a dozen kinds of tasks . Each small group was doing its work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . On a cold day the workmenwere overcoated , gloved , warmly clad . A dozen , and sometimes a score of idlers , leaned against the railings that strung about the vacant lot , watching the workers The idlers were clad about as the workers were , and the workers were clad about as the men hurrying along to the Avenue on business errands . A shabbier , dustier , more worn brown appeared in the workers ' clothes , and a few more wrinkles than appeared on the clothes of the wayfarers ; but that dusty brown made the chief difference between those who were working with their hands and those who idled or hurried into the offices that rose ten , fifteen , twenty stories in the buildings nearby . The foremen were not distinguished from the workers in either clothing or in the manner of their occupation . They all worked ; no man idled . Few gave orders . The orders were reasonably polite . Four years ago I saw wreckers working around a temple in Egypt near Luxor . They were digging it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twenty , naked save for a loincloth , grubbing up the debris and talus of another age , uncovering some ancient temple with a tradition hallowed in Egypt about as the Park Avenue Hotel was hallowed in Manhattan . The foreman , turbanned and draped in long dark skits , stood over the youths , yelling at them , cursing them , urging them to their task . They , watching the tail of his eye with snakelike cunning , did as little clawing in the earth as possible , filled as few leaky baskets as possible , under which their comrades groaned as they carried them out of the excavation . Occasionally , and when a white man came along , to emphasize the abysmal difference yawning between the foreman and the workers , the turbanned man cracked his whip and let the lash fall upon the naked back of some boy who jumped and winced and began to claw eagerly in the earth . Another foreman , or superintendent , much more gorgeously turbanned , much more splendidly robed , sat aloof , as far from the slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And occasionally , strolling into the work , came another man , an Egyptian apparently , of the scholarly cast , whose eyes scorned the superintendent and could not even see the foreman and had no social consciousness whatever of the naked creatures groveling in the dust -- ages in time behind him and unspeakably beneath . By way of diversion , some American tourists threw a handful of copper coins at the grubbing boys . They started to pounce upon the coins like hungry pups when the foreman 's lash cracked , driving them away , and he stooped down and gathered the loot . Somewhere in the contrast between those pictures lies all that is worth while in America . Before going into the obvious contrasts between the pictures , let us find the common points in each . Probably , at least typically , there was profit for the employer in both jobs . Upon his profit both bosses lorded it over those who walked and worked in the economic rank just be- , neath the bosses . Probably there were fewer unsatisfied wants among the barebacked boys of Thebes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Thirty-third Street and Park Avenue . The workmen on each job most likely slept well , ate well according to the tradition and environment of the times and place , fought easily , lived and loved according to the distinction of each man 's temperament , whether he came from an Eastside tenement or from a mud hovel along the Nile . The boys in Thebes did not seem to mind the lash . The men on Park Avenue did not seem to be oppressed by the compulsion which made them work and allowed the idlers to gaze at them . Very likely and typically , there may have been in each job , the one in Thebes , the one in Park Avenue , considerable favoritism , a little graft , some downright dishonesty , if each transaction were all unraveled and put under the magnifying glass of a cantankerous sociologist . And yet , despite these similarities which might be spun out still further , the two pictures revealed two civilizations , each civilization founded upon a deeply different social philosophy . In Egypt are the beginnings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can measure man 's advance . He has not come to the end of the trail , of course . But he seems to have been moving , and , in the various civilizations still functioning on the globe , we may trace the windings of man 's trail of progress . Now it is fair to ask what is the chiel gain which man has made on his lone journey . It is reasonable to presume that the journey has been an upward journey . What has man found in these later , and probably higher , levels which he did not have when he left the woods and settled in the open valley with his herd , his plow , and his boat upon the stream and inland sea ? What , in thi Mediterranean civilization , of which America is the direct descendant , has man found that is new and worth while ? Why , indeed , is it better for man , taking him as merely a two-legged , burden-bearing animal , to live in America than to live on the banks of the Nile ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material aspects of his civilization as he has marked it by his philosophy of life , considering the material things about him as the outward and visible sign of his inner and spiritual attitude toward life . Now man 's spiritual attitude which marks his progress is chiefly toward his fellows , but somewhat toward the things outside himself which he fancies make for his security and happiness . The attitude which marks and makes the difference between the boys under the lash of Thebes and the men under orders at Thirty-third Street and Park Avenue , New York City , United States of America , is the attitude of good will manifest in mutual consideration . This mutual consideration which dominates our Western civilization ? the civilization of Europe and America , with all its imperfections too obvious to enumerate ? has enlarged one quality in man which makes the Western man different from his fellows on the planet . The Western man has self-respect . That is " the pearl of great price . " That is the thing for which man in the West ideally would lose his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that in America men may easily be self-respecting , the millions have come flocking to the United States from all over the globe . Self-respect is bought with many things , but the common coin with which men to-day seek to buy it is gold , money , wealth , the thing epitomized in the word capital . To be free from the lash for one day , for one year , for one life is the chief end of man . iNot because of the ease it brings , but because of the freedom it brings . Freedom is another name for self-respect . 4 Democracy is institutionalized selfrespect ? nothing more , and , ideally , little less . It is odd to watch man inthe ages between Thebes and New York City , nosing about for five thousand years against the hard wall of time and circumstance , burrowing for a quick passage through to self-respect . He tried here , a military empire under Rome ; there , a feudal system ; yonder , a hierarchy ; beyond , a limited monarchy ; each attempt coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not hard to find fault with the tunnel man has made , to show that lie has doubled back many times , to see where he has futilely followed blind leads . It is absurdly easy to look into man 's heart to-day in the quest for democracy and find there evidences of envy , of greed , of blindness , of malice , of all the lusts of the flesh . The mean spirit that ever chains man to his clay prison is always flaunting itself . So , of course , democracy , and particularly American democracy , is crass , is crammed with injustices , strident with disharmony , marred with ugliness , cursed with selfishness . Bernard Shaw in " Pygmalion " makes his hero ask a lady , " if she fancied it would be agreeable if the hero came out frankly with all the things in his mind . " The lady twitters that it might be cynical , and the hero shrieks , " It would not be decent . " Every wise man knows this and yet he understands that beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep aspirations , its struggling nobility , its unrealized ideals . So it is with democracy . Who can doubt that our American democracy has built into stone and steel , brick and wood , even into the institutions of commerce and of government , of religion and social usage , a million aspects of our animal indecencies ? Always man has made his obscene gods , but he has always fashioned his glorious vision ; always he has tempered his ideal justice with palpable inequity . To point out in American civilization its banality ; to stress our commercial greed , our ravening imperialism on the sea whereon the flag follows the bargain ; to fall down in despair before boodlers and grafters in politics ; to grow gloomy in the face of social climbers ; to surrender all hope for America because of the tabloid newspapers , jazz in the radio , and the demagogue in public life ? in short , to stress the indecencies obvious in the scum of our consciousness , is to see life as a child sees it and to miss its meaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome " would forget also the vast cruelties of those civilizations which outbalanced for the common man the superficial beauties that survive those civilizations . Progress in a civilization must be measured by its effect upon man in the average if we are to accept what seems to be man 's aim in his struggle with his environment since the dawn of history . In some other age another man may aspire to something better than self-respect . He may seek some attitude finer than his own soul 's freedom . But since man first began making his record in the world , it seems fairly clear that he has been striving for just one thing ? the right to be his own and not another 's It is pathetic to observe the various objects which man has brought in his hand with which to pay the gods of life in his quest for self-respect . He walked through countless unrecorded ages bringing two things ? the soldier 's sword and the priest 's miter . Through war and religion he sought to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity . Then he came with the ballot in its various forms which produce self-government . Now he comes bringing capital . Each price ? war , religion , democracy , capitalism ? has represented a change in man 's philosophic expression of the same ideal , his yearning for the thing called equality of opportunity . Of course , envy of his fellows has motivated much of man 's activity in seeking that equality of opportunity which makes for self-respect . But envy does not debase all of his conduct . If envy debased everything in the struggle for self-respect there would be no heroes . Man would be without nobility ? a brother of the beasts . Envy permeates the struggle for democracy but it does not explain it . Ill The pathetic restlessness with which man tries first one thing and then another in bargaining for the democratic ideal ? the sword , the miter , the ballot , the dollar ? is most patent to-day in America . There are signs that we are losing faith in the ballot and relying more and more on the dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous shock when the governments of the world failed to bring peace out of the War . In America for twenty-five years before the War the people had been striving to make government work as a democratic agency They had faith in the ballot , they believed in political power as an agency for justice , and seemed to feel that if they could put that power , through the ballot , into the hands of the common man , he would use it intelligently , unselfishly , nobly . So in America all kinds of political devices for strengthening the power of the masses : the direct election of United States senators , the primary , the initiative and referendum , the secret ballot , the headless ballot , anti-corruption laws ? came into American political life . Still the millennium receded as we approached it . The American quest for justice which would bring self-respect to the individual by equalizing the political opportunities of all individuals , proved to be a vain quest . We found some justice , we equalized some opportunities , we checked some iniquities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forces of greed within us which ever seek , and ever have sought since the days of Cain and Abel , to overcome the nobler passions of men in establishment of good will ? good will which promotes social peace , which brings justice and self-respect into the hearts of men . The particular form in which the devil in our hearts has become manifest during the last two or three hundred years , the dragon against which the St. George of democracy has been struggling , has been capital . A wiseacre of Broadway declares , " There are many things in this life that are better than money , but it takes money to get them . " In humanity 's quest for self-respect man has repeated in his use of capital as a bargaining agent with the gods somewhat the struggle he made with each of the ancient devices by which he has sought to attain his ideal . It is something more than a quest , something less than a bargain , this ceaseless endeavor to find " the pearl of great price . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the miter , the ballot , ar the dollar ? with which to buy his way into Utopia , he always finds that the thing which he believes will save Um actually menaces him . The capital if the present age , which has been proluced by " many inventions , " has , of ourse , brought the average man far into he realm of social dignity ; but as surely s we have advanced far , behind the . gis of capital , so we arc now threatned by it , and in America this is paricularly true . America is the paradise of capital . ' or three hundred years , during the rise f capitalism in the world , America has een the spot to which men from all ver the world have been attracted by ie love of money . They have called it 3e love of freedom , but the freedom ) 1 ' the most part has been bought with Taal . The continent is rich , the ehtate salubrious , life abundant . Wealth . s piled high , and no man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow , the vish hand of nature in a virgin tont " - mt , rich in alluvial soil and minerals , essed with a temperate climate , has Aped to pile up and yet distribute ealth . Somehow , the very abundance wealth has made it easy for the average an to acquire a share . So here from all ' er the earth the poor and oppressed we come and found the self-respect which they have been denied in other places . Government has taken wealth from the few and given its blessings to the many in the form of education , policing , regulatory measures affecting transportation , communication , and human welfare . The government has bought health for the masses out of taxes ; the government has engaged in the care of the poor , of the defective , and has organized opportunity in a score of ways undreamed of in other times and places . But with all this public activity , with all the political distribution of wealth , with all our legislation , with all our constitutional prohibition of hereditary caste , vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are its uglinesses , its disharmonies , and its terrible standardization . Politics , that benevolent goddess who mothers the weak and the oppressed with sheltering institutions , who distributes her largesse in schools , in health , with a certain show of justice in her courts , has another mood and face . She is a corrupt and designing hussy . American politics are probably no worse than the politics of any other laud ; but while we are praising what our government has done we should not deny that government also is the shield for special privilege , that government does make it possible for the rich to enjoy privileges in our courts which are denied to the poor , that government does at times act with stupidity , and at times with cupidity . The Declaration of Independence , which is the charter of our liberties , the covenant of our self-respect in America , the source of our idealism , has only been partially realized under our Constitution . Our Constitution , with all its wisdom , still has far to go to institutionalize all the ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that noble document of 1776 ; and it is folly to deny that in man 's quest for self-respect here in America he is faced continually by the dangers of plutocracy , the dangers of a despotism as cruel and as unjust as any of the despotisms out of which he has struggled in ages past . But the joyous thing about it is that in America the fight is a fair fight . If we are brave enough and wise enough and honest enough to make the fight for self-respect , even against the centripetal forces of capitalism , we can win out of very capitalism itself all the liberties which our hearts desire . Granted all that the finical say about and against America . Granted that our politics are corrupt . Granted that much of our standardization is ugly ; that in democratizing the arts we have somewhat debased the arts . Granted that in distributing the products of commerce and industry we have quickly elevated millions into living standards which they do not appreciate and can not evaluate wisely . Granted that democracy is crass , motivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? still America , more than any other section of the earth , does guarantee to each human being according to his capacity for industry , courage , and intelligence , a right to look squarely into the face of his peers , dream his own dreams , follow his own visions , live his own life , with such abundance , with such beauty , and with such joy as his own heart . may contain . It is that making of potential self-respect which has drawn the millions to our shores all these three hundred years , the age which has seen the rise of capitalism in the world . Here man may find in his battle against the forces which would crush him into servility a fine field and a fair fight ? a fair fight despite all the tremendous prestige and power of aggrandized wealth . For in America aggrandized wealth is not fool proof . It is not established by a legal hereditary caste . Waste may take away from the fool the thing he cherishes and pass his money to the wise . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The titled fool without his money elsewhere in the world still holds his prestige ; the fool without hismoney in America is just " a fool i ' the forest . " Iv That which America has done with humanity is to make the dynamic man ? the man eager for change . Throw the whole kit of modern inventions , from steam engine to the radio , into the African jungle or into the midst of Asia , or even into the European peasantry , and these inventions would bring no hope , would change no social or economic status , would bring no relations of man based upon the faith of man in his fellows . Somewhere in a laboratory , working with his tubes and fires , a scientist in an apron is weighing , measuring trying , changing , poking his fingers into a place along the dead wall that impedes our further progress , and maybe to morrow , maybe next month , or next year or the next decade or the next century he will find the thing that will upset an revolutionize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will affect mankind firs and surest and in the broadest wa : in America , because America accept change . In the golden quest of th ages , the quest for self-respect , we hav built actually a new kind of man i America . There is something in the theor of the Christian theologians that ma must be born again . In America he regenerated . On the North America continent and among the Englisi speaking colonies , the white man look at life squarely and without a servile e3 , He is no white-winged cherub , no pin angel . By no means has his altruis overcome his eye for the main clianc With all his keen anxiety for change ar his profound belief that change is alwa : for the better , with all his institutiol taxing the few for the benefit of tl many , in education and health , prote tion and regulation , the Americar altruism does not soften him into it potency . He still believes that things conic to him who hustles while waits , and grabs quickly . But while grabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not for the dollar but for the game rather . He has no sou grip . Pennies and dollars slip through his hands after he has them . He gambles with his gains like a drunken sailor . More than most of his brothers , the American knows that he is his brother 's keeper . The thing which has left him in his rebirth is cruelty . He is not callous of suffering and pain ; certainly he is not plagued with the sadist 's love to hurt . He hits hard , but takes no comfort in revenge . He went into the World War partly in fear , partly prodded by propaganda which worked him into a fine frenzy of altruistic folly . But while he fought like a devil he came out of it with a gay , childish vanity in the fact that he had asked no ransom , that he had exacted no stipend for revenge , or remuneration , and had added nothing to : he suffering of mankind . He does not vet realize the implications that follow he collection of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may make fine gesture and throw his notes into he sea . And at the end of the episode which began in Serajevo in 1914 , the 1. meriea , n will be the only man connected nth the sad occurrence who has not eaped , consciously and in the sweet D lace of revenge , any intentional reward nom the War . This is not because he is etter or worse than other men . It is ecause the American is reborn , reenerated , renewed in self-respect . Anther millennium may improve him , may ' fine him , may quicken his sensibilities id broaden his intellectual and spiritual Drizon . Heaven hasten the day . But atil that day comes let us Americans be fooled and discouraged by those le-eyed critics who see only our faults . If they say " America has no native art " t them remember that she patronizes e art of the world generously and , upon e whole , intelligently . If her statesen are cheap , short-sighted , and dull , her inventors are completing the work of civilization where politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except those who jangle jazz , let it not be forgotten that we have orchestras , good orchestras , conducted , if you will , by Europeans , but still patronized by the masses ; more good orchestras than any other land . The great composers of other times and other lands find to-day their largest audiences in America . Our literature may be provincial , but we are cosmopolitan in our taste for literature . Our religion may be dominated to a larger extent than the religions of other lands by a tom-tom evangelism and bull-roaring emotionalism . But where else will the weak find public succor so near him ? In what other hundred millions on earth is health being conserved by public institutions ; and where else does the cry of distress , from whatever corner of the world it comes , find such quick and wide response ? That is the test of our religion , not our yapping , jumping , Hell-spreading evangelists . It is easy to criticize America , and on the whole it is wise to do so . The gadfly 's proboscis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontent ; but let us also remember , as we listen to our critics , that humanity is wiser than they , and that if America had not some real thing to offer , if America had not " the pearl of great price , " America would not be the magnet which is turning to our shores the dreams of the millions from all over the world . Here they come , these eager millions , willing to lay down their lives , their traditions ; eager even to give over that dearest of all inheritances ? their own nationalities , that they may find joy and salvation in the rebirth which is America . The millions who seek to become Americans are indeed willing to give their lives that they may save them . That great fact is our challenge to the world .
