J. , a son of David Wesson , a widely known consulting chemist and cottonseed oil expert and technical adviser to the Southern Cotton ' 011 Company , as " Captain Sommers . " Miller did this , Mr. Gibbs says he told him , because " Feist was ip a jam " and he did n't want Wesson to know his right name . Last January , according to what Mr. Gibbs says Miller told him , about $1,000 was obtained from young Wesson for two of the spurious bonds . Wesson was cautioned to keep them in a safe deposit box .

Mr. Gibbs said that . according to the statements , Miller took Thompson to the Hotel Plaza branch of Hutton &; Co .. where five of the bonds were sold for $5,200 .

It was said by Mr. Gibbs that while Feist accused Thompson , of having told him that he knew the bonds were without value , Thompson denied that he had ever made such an admission . Young Mr. Wesson. who called at the District Attorney 's office yesterday , said that he had loaned Feist , whom he knew as " Captain Sommers , " money on two of the bonds . " I know a great many more people who are out of pocket for the same reason , " Mr. Wesson said . " They are men who are so high up that they will not admit having been stung , as that would be a reflection on their business judgment . " Mr. Wesson said that Feist had given some of the Steel and Tube Company of North America bonds to A. D. Farmtvorth of Montclair as security for a loan . He said he discovered his own two shares were worthless on Jan. 24 last , when he tried to sell them . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of North America , Mr. Wesson. told Mr. Gibbs that Miller also sold stock in the " Interstate Chemical Foundation of Delaware " Mr Gibbs said he believed that these transactions warranted investigation and that one would be made as soon as possible . Allan M. Price of the American Bank Note Company was called to the District Attorney 's office to examine the spurious bonds . He said that the genuine bonds of the Steel and Tube Company of America .. were steel engravings , while the valueless paper which has been circulated was cheaply printed on a " stock " border . Representatives of the lithograph concern which sells the blanks upon which the bonds were printed reported yesterday that ' they had been able to check up all sales with the exception of 500 . . Mr. Gibbs believes that all of the spurious paper was of the $1,000 denomination and says it seems increasingly probable that the frauds may total $500:000 .
