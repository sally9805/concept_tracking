Baguio 's Brent <P> Sirs : The death yesterday of Bishop Charles Henry Brent of the Episcopal Diocese of Western New York has come as a great shock to his many admirers . <P> One of his outstanding but little heard of contributions to improving conditions in the Philippine Islands was the establishing of the Baguio Boys ' School at Baguio , a summer resort high in the mountains north of Manila . This school was established about 1907 , if I remember correctly , and the first headmaster was Dr. Remsen B. Ogilby , now president of Trinity College , Hartford , Conn . At the time this school was established , educational facilities in the Islands were practically nil for American youngsters whose parents were in the Islands for military or commercial reasons . At that time , I remember going to a Catholic school in Cotabato where all instruction was given by men in Spanish and I was the only white pupil . Shortly after , an American school teacher opened a public school , and I transferred to it . I sat between a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I joined heartily in " My countree ' t is off dee " every time a visitor showed up . What a relief it was to go to Baguio with twenty odd other American boys , and be taught by a small group of the finest men and instructors I have ever had-all hand picked by Bishop Brent . The mountain climate , excellent care and discipline , and the best of instruction make me recall my Baguio days as the happiest of my boyhood , and it was all due to Bishop Brent 's realizing a crying need of the times and supplying this need with a school that still is ranked very high among boys ' schools . <P> W. B. HOLDEN New York , N. Y. <P> To Subscriber Holden all thanks for a TIME-worthy report. - ED . <P> Raleigh 's Eyes <P> Sirs : <P> Why reprimand TIME 'S correspondent for failing to see Mr. Coolidge rise to shake hands with Mr. Hoover at the Inauguration when no less a personage than Sir Walter Raleigh himself was deceived by his own eyes ? <P> Sir Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his History of the World . Leaning on the sill of his window he meditated on the duties of the historian to mankind , when suddenly his attention was attracted by a disturbance before his cell . He saw one man strike another , whom he supposed by his dress to be an officer ; the latter at once drew his sword and ran the former through the body . The wounded man felled his adversary with a stick , and then sank upon the pavement . At this juncture the guard came up and carried off the officer insensible and then the corpse of the man who had been run through .
