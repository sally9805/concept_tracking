T HE director in the theatre 1 is a specific individual , he is the master of all technique and the responsible head of all technicians , including the actors . In twelve years of professional attendance at the theatre I have seen hundreds of plays in which no other function was required , and have been entertained by these plays without reservation ; occasionally , by grace of a good play , I have even been moved by a play brilliantly managed in this technical sense . The conception of the theatre which lives by expertness of technique is particularly attractive to me ; it is the average commercial theatre , the theatre of our comedies and musical shows , the theatre without solemnity or religion . The theatre , again , conceived purely as play , as relaxation , as diversion from the obstinacy of our own preoccupations and our limited series of significances . It is the theatre considered as a dependent , a secondary social function , and not as an end in itself . A theatre of weariness . Yet it has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to learn justice to the other theatre , the theatre in which the artist lives and gives life . It seemed to me for long that the effort to give life to the theatre was compounded of impure elements , and the abortion of these efforts always affected me as more painful than the failure of less ambitious schemes in the playful theatre . I had to be moved forcefully by the presence of success ( in the effort , not in the commerce of the result ) ; and , tentatively , a dissatisfaction with the secondary theatre has predisposed me to find happiness in the other . The artist in the theatre excludes the meretricious ; the technician , when he loses his feeling for his material , embraces what is cheap . You may have a play botched and dull , like JUAREZ AND MAXIMILIAN ; but you are spared THE GREEN HAT . The artist in the theatre is , broadly , the one who creates . A few years ago we would have been compelled to dissociate the word " artist " from its limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the then current focus of interest in the designer of scenery and costumes was another deplorable limitation of the scope of the artist 's work in the theatre . The flurry of specialized interest seems to have passed and the designers of settings have become , or tried to become , artists in the wider sense in which I am using the word . They have found that it is unsatisfactory to create piecemeal ; the actors and the chief electrician and the dramatist are compelled to do this ; but there can be ultimately no satisfaction to the creator in the theatre until all these partial creations are synthesized , unified , recreated by himself . There is no agreement on the important question , what is it that the artist in the theatre creates ? Against the usual answer , Illusion , Mr Stark Young has devoted brilliant and persuasive pages in his new book , Theatre Practice . ' " What the actor gives us is a reality and no illusion , " he says , and suggests that if it were an illusion we might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre . This conclusion , which seems drastic , has , in Mr Young 's development , interesting sources . He is so enthusiastic for the theatre in itself , so impatient with the plebeian idea that the actor feels or is his part ( Chaliapin does not play Boris , he is Boris ? the less Chaliapin he ! ) so correctly certain that it is no part of the actor 's or theatre 's function to reproduce actuality , that his theory of the theatre strikes us as extremely important , and only its application , its practice , not wholly satisfactory . For by illusion Mr Young seems only to mean an illusion of the actual , an indistinguishable reproduction of an original . This is what people often mean when they say that the theatre gives them illusion , and it is worth combating . Vulgar errors about politics and snakebite may have their uses ; but a low conception of the art of the theatre will eventually bring low the theatre itself . But there is a sense in which objection to illusion as the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the objection to the artifice by which the theatre creates its effects . The scene played on the stage , behind the footlights , is ? it exists as surely as a man walking down the street exists . But except in the rarest instances ? if the man be an Emperor and walk in a parade as the embodiment of Empire , for example ? the man merely is , he does not seem ; and it is this seeming , underlying the mere being of the  | scene on the stage , which gives the theatre its potency and its charm . To a child , the first time at the theatre , the seeming and the being merge ; and there are people who have kept that childlike rapture and innocence before the footlights . They are not always illiterate , merely uncritical . I recall that an effort of mine to make a distinction between Mr Chaplin , the taxable citizen and social being , and Charlie , the figure created by him on the screen , was considered by an awe-inspiring critic to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that one can not see Charlie for looking at Chaplin , can not feel Hamlet because of the presence of Barrymore . But the reward is magnificent when you are doubly aware of Barrymore and of Hamlet , when through the delicate equivocation of your mind you eventually recognize Hamlet through Barrymore . No matter how completely and how intensely Barrymore acts Hamlet , the primary reality which this acting offers in the theatre must remain a tidbit for critics ; the second reality , the noble idea , the exalting truth , the witty point which an actor or a scene can give us , will not appear until the playing reaches to the intensity of appearing to be something else than playing . I can not see why this appearance should not be called illusion , since it gives us a sense of being what it is not , provided we hastily add that it is an illusion not of reality , but of unreality . It is the illusion of the unreal , and to say that this constitutes reality seems to me to be using dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically the existence of a world created by laws other than our own , existing under a logic we can not grasp , having a flow and ebb which perhaps do not correspond to the courses of our blood , and a pulse which we can not relate to our own , yet which we feel to be intrinsically right . This creation of a world not ours is to me the grandeur of the theatre . To play a clerk so that he is like a clerk is a poor achievement for an actor who can , with observation and brainwork and talent , play a clerk who conveys to us what no clerk individually can convey , the entire significance , the pathos and the terror and the magnificence , if there is magnificence , of clerkship . It is the function of the director in the theatre-as-play to see that an actor playing a clerk will not suddenly strut like a prize-fighter , nor talk like a professor , nor mince like an interior decorator . For in the theatre so conceived the first stage of illusion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of importance , but only recognition of surfaces . It is , essentially , a theatre to which we bring our own laws of existence , the rhythm of our own heartbeats , the duality of our having two hands and two feet and two lobes in the brain ; and the contravention of these modes affects us as an affront or a failure . But in the creative theatre a clerk might walk like Napoleon and yet be all clerk , without offense to our apprehension , because in that theatre the milieu in which the clerk moved would have already created its own laws , and so long as the clerk existed in accordance with those laws , however different from our own , we should accept him , as we accept poetry in the theatre or magic . It is a common complaint that audiences laugh in the wrong place . Let a phrase of current slang come into Cleopatra 's mouth , let a gesture remind the audience of an item in the day 's news , and the incongruity will stir them to laughter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the costumes and the lights and the tone of voice and the very door-knobs have combined to create an atmosphere in which " That 's not so good " sounds so inevitably the torture of Cleopatra that the shop-girl in the subway is forgotten . There must be no break in the communication which the stage holds with the audience ; false tone , false personality , false colour , are all interruptions , and the spectator , unused to giving himself utterly to the stage , welcomes the break to fall back into the world of his familiarity . The play which is homogeneous , created , sure , allows none of these escapes ; the theatre in which the parts are not related can not maintain its relation with the audience . But the problem of making a production homogeneous is not merely a question of seeing that if an escritoire is eighteenth century , the shoe-heels are also eighteenth century ; such a superficial unity is instantly undone by the intrusion of an actor or a voice or a gait which happens not to be properly schooled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play itself is not in the spiritual period assigned to the actors and the setting . The process of creation begins with the discovery of style , of the one style in which the meaning of the play becomes clear . It seemed to me , last year , that making ARMS AND THE MAN a costume comedy about militarism completely lost the point of the play ( the point of conflict between the realistic and romantic temperaments ) just as the production of THE CALL OF LIFE as a period play about militarism precisely hit the medium which expressed its point of conflict be- tween youth and age , discipline and rebellion . That it is not a question of costume , but of atmosphere , one gathered from the mufti HAMLET which remained less activated by modern psychology than the costumed HAMLET of John Barrymore . With a Shakespearean production we are always left groping a little , since interpretation has convinced us that different meanings are possible , and all we can ask is that , from the moment one meaning is chosen , all others be excluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of finding the category into which a play falls ( unpopular as categories and classes happen to be at the moment ) is essential because the category illuminates the meaning for us and prevents us from slipping out of bounds . A Shubert MIKADO making it a revue , an Ames IoLANTHE making it polite comedy with excursions into farce , are equally defective in this first essential , of knowing the style . Recognize Gilbert and Sullivan as operetta and the name itself , with its traditions , indicates the points of emphasis : wit and music . You can not , in operetta , jazz the music ; you dare not sacrifice the words to speed the action . The Savoy operettas , it happens , are the archetype in the English-speaking theatre ; it is only necessary to know what they purport to be , in order to create them successfully . Failure to recognize the category into which they fall means a broken production ( however agreeable in many respects ) and as this is true of a simple case , it is true of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Edmond Jones 's Drawings for the Theatre 1 and allow you , five years after the production , to meditate on the exceptional rightness of the settings for a production made in the same key . The luminous ogive frames which made up the motif of the settings spoke as clearly as words to declare that MACBETH was to be played for its inner values , that the trampling melodrama and the obscene witches were to be diminished or exaggerated so that we would lose our old preconceptions of murderers and ghosts and confront spiritual exaltations and terrors directly . The play was to deal with essences ; to be an " anatomy . " There was , in the event , no such play , since no principal actor within that setting had understood or accepted the meaning of the play as Mr Jones saw it . One turns in the same volume to his three drawings for THE CENCI in which the massing  | of the players and the disposition of a few tables or spears seem to create all there is to be of settings ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render the quintessence of the play ; and Mr Jones 's preoccupation recently with the whole art of the theatre , not with any part of it , gives one hope that when THE CENct is produced , his style will prevail . The most obdurate material in the hand of the theatre artist is the actor . Until you use him en masse ( as Mr Norman-Bel Geddes proposes to use him in his vast project for the Divine Comedy 1 ) the actor refuses to diminish his points of attraction , as he considers them , by playing in any style which does not bring those points into relief . This refusal is not always explicit ; one sees it in a gesture or hears it in an intonation ? an unconscious rebellion against the pressure of an imposed style . The advantage of stock and repertory is not so much in the training an actor receives for many different parts ; it is in the bar which these various parts place between an actor and the image of himself at his best . The good actor will always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The average actor capitalizes a single notorious success or a trick of personality . It is of little consequence to the audience that an actor " is always playing himself " or is " a different person in each part " ; what is of consequence is that the actor should be able to subdue the manner and mannerisms of that self or person to the mood of the play in which he appears . It is the director 's business to prevent the actor from making too much of a part ; and it is the artist 's business to see that whether he makes much or little of a part , the actor creates in the terms of the given play . This conception does away with inspirational acting as surely as it does away with " having a good time " for the players in a revue . It is not their good time , but ours , that we pay for in the one ; not their private inspiration , but the afflatus of the whole play which we seek in the other . There must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the art of the theatre and knows that in his case the whole is literally greater than the part . The actress who tries to be appealing or natural in a strictly conceived production of THE WAY OF THE WORLD is as bad as the actress  | who fails to be whimsical in PETER PAN ; the meaning of a play can not be communicated by the independent and unchecked activities of all-star personalities . There is no escape from tyranny in the theatre , and all efforts so far have only divided the mouthpieces through which the tyrant makes his will known . Mr Jones and Mr Young both quote the same passage from Plotinus : " As the actors of our stages get their masks and their costumes , robes of state or rags , so a Soul is allotted its own fortunes , and not at haphazard , but always under a Reason : it adapts itself to the Fortunes assigned to it , ranges itself rightly to the drama , to the whole principle of the piece . Then it speaks out its own business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express of its own quality , as a singer in a song . . . . But these actors , souls , hold a peculiar dignity . They act in a vaster place than any stage . The Author has made them masters of all this world . " A comparatively fresh cliche in criticism is " pace , " meaning speed , changes of speed , and the relation between one system of speeds and another . I have recently read an article by D. W. Griffith on Pace in the Movies which indicates that the counts on which action is based in the pictures correspond to the heartbeat , suggests that acceleration on the screen , when properly produced , can cause acceleration in the pulse of the observer , and notes that when a character goes out of a room at a certain speed , he should remain in that speed when next shown outside the door . Pace , in short , is our temporary critical omnibus ; in the minds of directors it seems actually to mean high speed instead of rate of speed ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr Ames , will send IoLANTHE scurrying so that only fragments of the gorgeous Finale of Act One can be heard . Here the trickiest of our orchestra conductors would be of service , for it has been their established custom to drag an andante passage in order to make a presto seem livelier than it actually was . Pace , in its effect on the audience , depends on relative rates of speed , not on rapidity . When meditation on a play has brought to the artist an assured sense of its meaning , its style , he can begin the labour of dividing  | and subdividing his text until he discovers the tiny units which compose the whole . To each of these scene-units he assigns a tempo , just as in rehearsal he must assign a definite speed to every speech and gesture . The speed of the part will depend obviously on the speed of the whole ; it will depend less obviously , but more significantly , on what the artist feels is the relation of part to part , of scene to preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILD DUCK as a tragicomedy will play the scenes between Gina and Hjalmar much more rapidly than THE WILD DUCK as a study in hysteria ; HAMLET as pure melodrama will require a different relation between its parts from the relation established in HAMLET as philosophical tragedy . Pace for the artist is a contribution to this creation of relations , which gives us the sense of rhythm in a play , and rhythm depends on the original conception of style . I wrote in my previous essay that we are aware of the internal rhythm of a play largely through our nerves , our motor-centres , that our sense of rhythm will be our awareness of the changes in pace and at the same time our feeling of the comparative duration of scenes . I think that a parallel might be erected for our sense of design in a production . It is sometimes thought that a perfectly designed production would be one in which a plot of the actual steps taken by all the actors in a scene would result in a graph having at least symbolical significance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In individual scenes , certainly , the movements on the stage trace a design on our retina , and we can be sure that this design affects our appreciation of the play , for we have all experienced the grateful sensation of watching the line a dancer traces in her movements , a sensation of physical beatitude . Beyond that point I think we become unconscious of details ; and the design of physical movement in a play will be only of the grand lines ; we may feel ( without definite recollection of any one actor or group ) that in one act movement was angular , in another it gave the impression of parallels , in a third of curves . In the handling of the great mass which Mr Geddes calls for in his Divine Comedy such stylization of movement would be essential ; the actors , by their mass movement , would actually help to change the appearance of the vast stage , as the ingenious lighting system already worked out changes the stage from deep to shallow , from round to oval . In ARABESQUE Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average time limit . It seemed ,  | on the whole , successful . It will be interesting to watch this development when the Divine Comedy is produced . So far , the design created by movement seems to me to be effective only in short spells . We follow Iago slowly in a circle round the baited Othello ; but no actor and no group has yet been trained to the use of the body to such a point that an entirely stylized and designed production would be successful . @# The playgoer of the last decade has become aware of attractive practical settings , has watched Rundhorizonts and magic lanterns and seen the influence of interior decorators , until now he is being prepared for flats again , fantastically decorated ; he has seen a hundred varieties of lights ; he has observed the high advantages of steps and levels , of actors in the audience , on runways , and out of sight . And he may turn to Robert Edmond Jones for a final word , which does not belittle this work , but relates it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to affirm and ennoble the art of these mystical Protagonists " ( the actors ) . He provides an investiture of dignity . But the artist , who must comprehend a hundred crafts and care for each of them , goes further . Ideally he would create his play , his production , and his audience . In each of these he meets resistance ; he must divine the idea of another man ; he must work in the limits of the theatre ; he must overcome the timidity and the lethargy of human beings . It is no wonder that he needs to have inspiration and to understand structure ; it is not even surprising that in his wrestling with his adversaries he begins to think himself a Priest . I am too sceptical to encourage him to priesthood ; there is still so much to be done in clear thinking , in perception , in developing the senses . But I do not bar the reverential attitude toward the theatre ; I suggest only that with piety there should always be the quality permanently joined to it in literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wit . It is wit without piety which now creates the best of our commercial theatre ; it is piety without wit which gives us the worst of our arty ones . Will it not be the function of the artist in the theatre to deliver us from this dilemma ' ?  |
