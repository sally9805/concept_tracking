The official text of a pronunciamento from Charles E. Hughes : <P> " The Department of State has canceled the authorization for a visa for Mme. Kalinin , wife of the President of the so-called Soviet Republic of Russia . The presence of Mme. Kalinin in this country is rendered wholly undesirable by the deep feeling which has been aroused by the execution of Vicar General Butchkavitch . The action of the department is taken especially in protest against this execution . "
