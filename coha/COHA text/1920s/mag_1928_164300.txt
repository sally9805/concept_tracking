On Christmas Day , 1893 , in Santa Rosa , Calif. , was born a man who has been called a liar more often than any living U. S. inhabitant . His name is Robert L. ( " Rip " ) Ripley . His peculiar ability is to say things that sound like lies , and then prove them to be absolutely true . His medium is a cartoon entitled " Believe It or Not , " which appears daily in the New York Evening Post and 100 other newspapers . His greatest hornswoggling of the " lie " - hurlers was a drawing of Charles Augustus Lindbergh 's Spirit of St. Louis bearing the caption : " Lindbergh was the 67th man to make a non-stop flight over the Atlantic Ocean . " Three thousand indignant letter-writers demanded that Mr. Ripley apologize . He calmly informed them that Alcock and Brown made a nonstop flight between Newfoundland and Ireland in 1919 , that 31 men were aboard the English dirigible Rj4 on its trans-Atlantic flight in 1919 , that 33 men were aboard the German Z-j ( Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. . , in 1922 . <P> Other famed statements of Mr. Ripley are : <P> " A Bhutan woman gave birth to a boy at the age of 82 . " <P> ' ' It cost $7,296 to discover America . " <P> " Joseph Mayott of California lost 6 inches in height in 6 years . " <P> " Thorn McAn has been robbed 252 times .

The item : " Marechal de Bas-sompierre poured 13 pint bottles of wine into a vase and drank it in one breath-as a toast to the 13 cantons of Switzerland . " Mr. Ripley had proof for this statement in French histories , which told how Marechal de Bassompierre , famed convivial , was sent by King Louis of France in 1625 to recruit Swiss guards and gain a pledge of allegiance from the Swiss cantons . Two Manhattan physicians , last week , said that the medieval historians had exaggerated , for it is impossible for the human system to hold 13 pints of any liquid at any given moment , and also impossible to drink more than 5 pints in one breath . <P> Mr. Ripley began drawing " Believe It or Not " eight years ago in the old New York Globe . Today , he employs a linguist , two readers , a secretary ; receives an average of 1,000 letters a week . He has traveled in 53 countries in search of material .
