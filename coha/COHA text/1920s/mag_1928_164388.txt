Red Hair . Raging cutely , Clara Bow , famed exponent of " It , " pulled off gold-dug clothes , jumped into a lily pond , and rose to the surface with only a lily in her red hair . She was an amorous manicurist , clipping three elderly clients for clothes until she met the nephew of one , whereupon in a burst of reform and shame she took the climactic pond plunge . Elinor Glyn devised the diverting asininity . <P> We Americans . Here was a chance to make a cinema that would be as obnoxious as Abie 's Irish Rose ( play ) . But Producer Carl Laemmle forfeited the chance by the dexterity of his workmanship . He depicts Jews , Irishmen , Italians , Germans , Swedes , Russians mingling in a U. S. city in a plausible manner . The young people are restless , ill at ease , in the parental homes . Ma and Pa Levine ( pants-presser ) wonder why , until a neighbor asks them the question : " Is n't it possible that your daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you parents can read and write the English language ? " So Ma and Pa go to night school . One day , when Ma is reciting the Gettysburg Address at home , she hears that her son had been killed in the World War while saving the life of Hugh Bradleigh , whose ancestors came over on the Mayflower . Then follows the logical cementing of the romance of Daughter Beth Levine and Hugh Bradleigh , happily avoiding the Jewish-Irish hookup . As Ma Levine , Beryl Mercer gave a grand performance . <P> Skinner 's Big Idea . Three loyal dotards had to be fired . Skinner ( Bryant Washburn ) , young , newly elected member of the firm had to discharge them as his first duty . Instead he imported a stenographer , peppy , once a showgirl ( Martha Sleeper ) . Stimulated , the dotards grew chipper , chirrupy . One bought a toupe , all bought brassies . Skinner 's big fresh idea results in the retention of dotards ; in a picture feeble , mild as goose milk . <P> The Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other all over the world until at last they clamped together in the heat and sog of the tropics . The cause of the final brawl is Evelyn Brent . In a sodden camp on a Latin American oil field , four men gaze hotly at her . One is George Bancroft , alternately brute &; gentleman , star of this affair . He hulks , and moralizes , fights , and suffers to no profit . <P> The Count of Ten . Charles Ray is the bashful bruiser , the simple-minded boy who could lick the champion . James Gleason , here a cocky misogynist , is his manager . When the manager goes away , Actor Ray puts on a pink shirt , yellow gloves , a cane , and spats , marries . Instead of taking on the champion , he takes on expenses and a gambling brother-in-law . At last , for quick money he fights the champion with a broken hand , and is , of course , beaten up . His wife had given him the count of ten .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
