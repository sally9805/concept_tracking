In one of the dazzling rooms of the French Foreign Office , a score of distinguished statesmen sat around a highly polished table . In the background were the underlings , porfolios under arms , pince-nez perched on noses , sleek hair plastered flat on knowing heads , well-pressed clothes hanging immaculately from shoulders and hips . <P> There was a tomblike silence in the room . Premier Theunis of Belgium poised his pen above a paper which lay before him . His right hand descended swiftly , there was a dexterous movement , a horrid , scratchy sound , a faint bump and a signature had been penned . A score of suspended breaths were released and the paper passed on to the representatives of France , Italy , Japan , with the same ceremony . Then the paper was passed along to U. S. Ambassador Frank B. Kellogg , Secretary of State-designate , at present accredited to the Court of St. James 's in London . Mr. Kellogg looked down at the paper , took pen in hand , looked up and said he supposed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reservation that his signature bound the U. S. Government " only insofar as the rights of the U. S. were concerned . " <P> At this , a solitary tuft of hair was seen to rise vertically from the otherwise bald pate of Winston Churchill , British Chancellor of the Exchequer . He was amazed at Mr. Kellogg 's statement . It had been understood , he said , that the U. S. delegation would sign the agreement ( concerning division of the proceeds of the Experts ' Plan ) before them , and would thereby become active partners in the Experts ' Plan . Premier Theunis of Belgium and Finance Ministers Clementel of France and De Stefani of Italy backed the views of Mr. Churchill . " How could the U. S. expect to collect from Germany and at the same time refuse to accept any responsibility ? " <P> Ambassador Kellogg looked nonplussed and , apparently fearing last-minute complications , drove his pen over the paper in front of him . U. S. Ambassador to France , Myron T. Herrick and Colonel James A. Logan , hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Mr. Kellogg 's name in the space reserved for the U. S. Representatives of Brazil , Greece , Portugal , Rumania , Yugo-Slavia and Czechoslovakia similarly exhibited specimens of their caligraphy . The agreement relating to the division of the proceeds of the Experts ' Plan ( TIME , Jan. 19 ) was in effect , each of the signatories having been vested with plenipotentiary powers . <P> From many places on the Continent of Europe , wild shouts were heard . The U. S. had abandoned its policy of isolation , had come back to Europe once more ! Everywhere old hatreds and bitternesses were forgotten . Everywhere the U. S. was extolled . All the leading statesmen paid tribute to the U. S. attitude . All said that U. S. co-operation had been bought at a cheap price . <P> Editor J. L. Garvin , writing in The Sunday Observer , London newspaper , said : <P> America in consenting to receive a share of the Dawes annuities assumed direct and inevitable responsibility for the working of the scheme . Nothing is changed in nominal principle . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies , but in a way which makes ' her almost an equal associate of Germany if that country keeps the character of a genuinely friendly and sensible nation .
