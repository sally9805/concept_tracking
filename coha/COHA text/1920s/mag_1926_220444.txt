The ridiculous squabble in Manhattan over the morals of the drama is currently reaching a crisis . The fate of the Citizens Play Jury is in the hands of the law . If this body is declared illegal and inoperative , censorship reverts to the old section 1140 of the penal code which makes it a crime to present an obscene , indecent , immoral and impure theatrical production . The flaw in this statute is the fallibility of human opinion . How is the Grand Jury qualified to decide between indecency and art ? Does Eugene O'Neill deserve the same latitude as Shakespeare ? Obviously if a hidebound Grand Jury is given rein much classic and modern expression will be throttled . Obviously if the lid is lifted altogether unscrupulous producers will grow fat pandering to the peep-show instinct of the populace . <P> To solve this gritty problem a Citizens Play Jury was planned some years ago . A panel of several hundred jurors , intelligent citizens from all walks of life , was drawn . When a complaint was lodged a dozen of these jurors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dozen found it , or any part of it , unfit , the whole or the part was to be withdrawn . The Producing Managers Association and the Actors Equity Association pledged themselves to enforce its decrees by withdrawing their plays or calling out their actors . <P> For some time this jury lay fallow . The God of Vengeance ( in which a brothel keeper hoped to keep his daughter untarnished , only to find her perverted by one of the women in his own establishment ) was indicted by the Grand Jury , and the producer and some of the performers fined ( 1923 ) . Last season William A. Brady voluntarily withdrew his Good Bad Woman after much agitation and a conference with the District Attorney . David Belasco purified his notorious Ladies of the Evening and it was allowed to run . <P> The Play Jury suddenly came to life and was delegated by the District Attorney to inspect They Knew What they Wanted , Desire Under the Elms , The Firebrand . The first two were passed and a recommendation of deletion in one scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Within the past month the Play Jury has again been summoned . Its delegates inspected two revues , The Bunk of 1926 and The Great Temptations ; and two plays , Sex and The Shanghai Gesture . The plays passed . Parts of Temptations were frowned upon and eliminated by the management . Bunk was ordered closed , obtained an injunction and , at this writing , is still playing , though considerably disinfected . <P> The State Supreme Court is now pondering whether the Play Jury , a nonofficial body , can be permitted to continue and enforce its edicts . If not , some form of legal and organized control will inevitably be instituted . <P> The playwrights , the actors , the producers , and the press solidly favor the citizens ' Jury . They feel that by this method only can the clammy fingers of legal censorship be kept from the throat of the drama . With the exception of determined radicals these same forces feel that some honest and clear-headed curb is necessary .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
