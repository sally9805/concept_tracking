Outrageously high-handed measures were countenanced by Dictator Marshal Josef Pilsudski during the general election completed last week . At the same time , however , he could point to an impartial report showing that Poland has prospered vastly since his swashbuckling seizure of power ( TIME , May 24 , 1926 ) . <P> Balloting . Thirty-four parties crowded the field , an average of slightly more than one political group per million Poles . To meet competition thus keen , the Sanatzia or Healthy Politics party , supporting Pilsudski , adopted quaint &; questionable expedients : <P> 1 ) Rural constituencies of ignorant Roman Catholics were treated to a cinema in which the Virgin Mary was shown celestially aiding the Marshal and by implication favoring his party . <P> 2 ) Pugnacious sympathizers of Sanatzia armed themselves with horsewhips and broke up many an opposition caucus . <P> 3 ) Throughout White Russia and the Polish Ukraine the police , acting apparently upon orders from Warsaw , declared invalid , for no valid reason , a majority of the party lists submitted in opposition to Sanatzia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferred from the fact that slightly more than half of those entitled to vote did not vote . <P> Results . Chosen were both a new Sejm ( Chamber ) and a new Senate . In the former Marshal Pilsudski obtained roughtly twice as many Deputies as are adherent to any other group , but even so his cohorts number not quite one-third of the Sejm as a whole . The great confusion of party lines made it difficult for even the Marshal to count his Deputies with exactness , but he claimed 150 out of a Sejm of 474 . The only trend discernible among the other parties was a leftward shift which virtually undermined the formerly potent Nationalist bloc and slightly swelled the ranks of the Communists . <P> When balloting for the Senate was complete , Marshal Pilsudski was found to have an even greater plurality of supporters than in the Sejm . No communist senator was elected . <P> Significance . When it is remembered that Marshal Pilsudski has carried on as Dictator since 1926 , though never supported in the Sejm by anything like a working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignificance . Politically , Poland is a loose conglomeration of irresolute entities , held together , for good or ill , by a National Military Hero . He remains , however , self-confessedly no statesman . The marvel is that Poland , once given the boon of a government which is at least stable , has forged ahead so rapidly in agriculture , industry and commerce . Pertinent is a report recently issued by Financial Advisor to the Bank of Poland Charles Schuveldt Dewey , onetime ( 1924-27 ) Assistant Secretary of the U. S. Treasury . <P> Advisor Dewey 's keynotes : <P> 1 ) Current budget receipts in Poland already show a surplus over expenditures of 214,000,000 zloty ( $24,010,800 ) which is expected to reach 300,000,000 when complete returns are available for the fiscal year . <P> 2 ) With two-thirds of the population engaged in agriculture , their production is now back at pre-War levels , and the harvest of 1927 exceeded that of 1926 by 10% . <P> 3 ) Employment in all vital industries is now the highest on record , and the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 100,000.
