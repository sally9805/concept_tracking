The old-fashioned family physician has long since given place to the specialist . Now the specialist is finding place in the medical group . All the ills that flesh is heir to can soon be treated in one great clearing house : The New York Medical Centre , towering on the Northern tip of Manhattan . Twenty acres are its base , from 165th to 168th St. , from Broadway to the Hudson River ; twenty-two stories measure its majestic height ; twenty millions of dollars have already gone into its construction and equipment ; twenty years it has been planning ; in this year of 1928 it stands completed , the greatest monument to medical progress in the world . On this single plot of ground will operate the following hitherto scattered Manhattan institutions : <P> The College of Physicians and Surgeons <P> of Columbia University The Presbyterian Hospital The Presbyterian Hospital School of <P> Nursing The School of Dental and Oral Surgery <P> of Columbia University The Vanderbilt Clinic The Neurological Institute The Babies ' Hospital The N. Y. State Psychiatric Institute <P> Cripples , babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering from ingrown toe nails , toothache , or an untimely encounter with a taxi , all will come to the Medical Centre . Here everything known about medicine will be centralized with a threefold purpose : <P> 1 ) To give the bewildered sick man a modern substitute for the family physician . <P> 2 ) To enable the specialist to work with other specialists , coordinating his research with the discoveries of his colleagues . 3 ) To train doctors , dentists , nurses , social workers , pharmacists together as a working unit in the presence of situations which will later constitute their life work . Seen in mysterious cloudy perspective from the Jersey shore , they rise in squat masses which gradually pile up to an impressive futuristic pyramid . A close-up reveals a compact group of eight skyscrapers , the high flat walls uncompromising in their rectangular simplicity . The Presbyterian Hospital , the Sloane Maternity &; Squier Urological Clinics form the main stem of the group . Wings come out starkly at right angles , reminding one a little of the flying buttresses of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for support . Everywhere the walls are pierced by windows , thousands of windows which relieve their perpendicular severity . The skyline too is pleasantly broken by the varying heights of the horizontal roofs . <P> The Idea . Vienna , Berlin , London , Paris , Heidelberg have developed little medical principalities . Harvard Medical School in Boston , Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore , Washington University Medical School in St. Louis , each forms the nucleus of a small group of hospitals . Rush Medical School in Chicago , one of the three oldest in the country , plans an association of hospitals on the Midway . In Cincinnati , the Municipal Medical School and Cincinnati General Hospital have fallen into line . The state universities of Michigan , Illinois , Iowa , Minnesota , Wisconsin have taken up the medical centre idea . Somewhat tardy , but by this very delay in a position to profit by all other experiences , certain citizens of New York , with a vigor and vision in keeping with their city 's resources , have outdone all other medical establishments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
