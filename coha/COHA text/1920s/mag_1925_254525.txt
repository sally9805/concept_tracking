Recently , Death loomed , up and two of the leaders of the Progressive movement left forever the scene of their labors-Senator LaFollette and Senator Ladd ( TIME , June 29 ) . <P> In the extreme left wing of U. S. politics there were few leaders remaining-possibly only three Senators- Brookhart , Frazier and Norris . Although Senator Brookhart was apparently reelected last fall , his title to a senatorship is not yet clear ( a recount will be undertaken July 20 ) , and his prestige suffered severely from his close escape . Senator Frazier does not appear as a possible leader of his group . Senator Norris , therefore , was Mr. LaFollette 's logical successor-by elimination if for no other reason . ( Senator Wheeler , Mr. LaFollette 's running mate last year was not generally considered a likely possibility , 1 ) because he is a Democrat and the LaFollette movement is largely a Republican off shoot ; 2 ) because he has his hands full , at least temporarily , with the charges which the Department of Justice brought against him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter formally renouncing this place . It was in answer to a letter from one Warren Shaw Fisher of the " Progressive Political League " of Manhattan : I have received quite a large number of other letters similar to yours , from other sections of the country , in which the writers make the same statement that is made in your letter that is , that I have " assumed " the leadership of the Progressive Party . I do not understand how this idea became so prevalent over the country . <P> In the first place , I would consider it improper for me to " assume " the leadership of any party or faction . As you perhaps know , I was not in favor of the organization of a Third Party , and did not join the movement . I never questioned the sincerity or patriotism of those who went into the Third Party movement , but it seemed to me that what the country was suffering most from was too much partisanship . <P> Party ties rest very lightly upon me , and , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest evils of government is that so many people tie themselves up to a party , when as a matter of fact it seems to me they ought to be independent of all parties . Under existing conditions , I presume parties are necessary , but it is a mistake to regard a party as anything but an instrumentality of government . <P> I expect to work in the future , as I have in the past , for those things in government that I believe to be right , and I will support them regardless of whether they originate with Democrats , Republicans , Progressives or men bearing any other party label . <P> I shall be glad to work in unison with anyone , regardless of his party affiliation , if he believes in the same progressive principles of government that I advocate , but I do not want to be associated with any political party as its leader . <P> Thanking you for your letter , I am <P> Cordially , <P> ( Signed ) GEORGE W. NORRIS . <P> Evidently , Senator Norris believes it more politic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with party ties resting lightly . " <P> But who will lead the extreme left ? <P> 1 ) Will there be no leader , and will the LaFollette following disintegrate ?
