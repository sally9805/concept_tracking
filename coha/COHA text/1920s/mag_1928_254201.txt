Last week . Charles Hayden , affable , playful , cultured and immensely able head of an immensely potent firm of private bankers , Hayden , Stone &; Co. ; Charles Hayden , keen bridge player and a director of probably more famed companies than any other financier , took an immensely important command in the Republican political army . He agreed to collect the money from New York State , from which most of the money must come . Mr. Hayden did not apologize ; he was proud to serve . Mr. Hayden did not resign anything ; no one even remotely hinted that he should . He had just as much right as any truck driver to work for the Republican party . <P> Mr. Hayden is far from being the first millionaire or **43;6729;TOOLONG to take off his $175 coat for Republicanism . His theoretical boss is a young **26;6774;TOOLONG called " Jerry " Millbank ( Eastern Treasurer ) . And the latter 's boss is the white haired president of Cleveland 's biggest bank , known to that city as " Joe " Nutt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Republicans , this has always been so . Years ago , that great Pittsburgh steelman , B. F. Jones , became chairman of the Republican National Committee , and it never entered his head to resign anything . So , today , the head of the Pennsylvania Railroad and dozens of equally potent tycoons are Hooverizing in official party posts . <P> Members of both parties put in sharp contrast Pierre Samuel Dupont 's feeling that even though he was not taking a Democratic job , he ought to resign from General Motors before endorsing the Brown Derby . As for Democratic Chairman John J. Raskob , he last week resigned from a lot he had not already resigned from .
