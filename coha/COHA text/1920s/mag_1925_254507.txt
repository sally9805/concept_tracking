At Nice , Mlle. Suzanne Lenglen has been playing tennis , always victoriously . Loungers in the sunshine of the Riviera smiled with tolerant skepticism at these glorious triumphs of the leaping Frenchwoman , for they observed that the women she defeated had seldom been heard of before and were rarely heard of again .

Lenglen would doubtless be opposed by Miss Elizabeth Ryan , famed California player . What was their chagrin when Miss Ryan defaulted in the second round ! Nice buzzed .
