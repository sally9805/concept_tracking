txt The difficulties which have attended efforts to have the Committee on Foreign Relations report - the multi-lateral pact renouncing war to the Senate were overcome today . By an informal vote Senator Borah , the committee 's chairman , was authorized to lay the treaty before the Senate with a favorable recommendation . Part . of the agreement under which this course was adopted provided . that the resolution of Senator ' Moses proposing that the Senate should express its " understanding " of the covenant 's terms should be reported by the committee without recommendation . All this means that the ' Kellogg treaty is to have the backing of the committee when it comes up for consideration in the Senate , : while the : resolution of Senator Moses will occupy the negative position of being before the Senate without commitment one way or another from the committee as to what should be done with it . Some Are For " Understanding . " The vote of the committee ' - for " reporting the pact with a:tecorathendation that it be relied was 14 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentiment of the committe e . While practically all its members are for ratification , there are some who contend that this step should be accompanied by an expression of the Senate to make clear its " understanding " of . what the - treaty contains . But everything known of the opinion held by the committee 's personnel goes to show that those who maintain there should be no interpretative expression attached to ratification are in the majority . President Coolidge expressed confidence today that the treaty wouldbe ratified without any reservation or accompanying resolution . It was made known also at the White House that the President had received assurances from " the Navy Department " that the bill authorizing the construction of fifteen 10,000-ton cruisers would be passed by the Senate . It was passed by the House at the preceding session . Suspect Cruiser Bill Forces . Efforts begun yesterday by Senator Borah to bring about an arrangement by which consideration of the cruiser bill would accompany consideration of the treaty are still un- ' determined . It was apparent today I that suspicion has been engendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the former 's advocates are unwilling that the treaty shall be debated in the Senate while the cruiser bill is being considered . To the cruiser bill forces is attributed the fear that if the pact is ratified first the argument will be advanced that till ratification of a treaty renouncing war makes it not only inconsistent but unnecessary for this government to build a formidable armada . While the resolution of Senator Moses expressing the Senate 's " understanding " of . the treaty's- terms will be reported to the Senate , it is to be redrafted . Senator Moses has undertaken to make the redraft after consultation , now in progress , with some of the members of the Foreign Relations Committee who share his view that an interpretative declaration must accompany ratification . It was reported this evening that the original reservation would be offered in the Senate so changed that only the declaration concerning the Menroe , Doctrine would be retained . This was denied . What Senator Moses is seekinc , to do is to rewrite the four points of " understanding " set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conform to ideas expressed in several days of debate at the committee 's secret sessions . While a quorum was.not present at the mceting of the Committee on Foreign Relations and Practically no discussion took place , an arrahgement was agreed to by which Senator Borah would poll the committee 's full membership on a. motion w report the treaty with a . recommendation that it be ratified and at the same time report the modified resolution . of Senator Mosses without " rc , .. dommendation . Committee Polled Informally . The poll was made informally on the floor of the Senate and in the cloak rooms with the following result : . For reporting the pact with a recommendation that it be ratified , Borah , Johnson , Edge ; Capper Gillette , Reed of Pennsylvania and Fess , Republicans ; Swanson , Pittman , Robinson of Arkansas , Walsh of Montana , Harrison and George , Democrats , and Shipstead , Farmer-Labor , total 14 . Against reporting ? Bayard and Reed of M r , issouri , ' Beniocrats , total 2 . Present and not voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward that he was not opposed to ratification but desired an interpretative declaration . It is possible that both the treaty and the resolution of Senator Moses will be reported tomorrow by Senator Borah . Whether he will act then will depend chiefly on whether an agreement is reached with the cruiser bill proponents ' to have the pact debated part of each . day that the cruiser program- is under consideration . But whatever happens tomorrow . it is certain that Senator Borah will take the action agreed on before the Senate takes its Christmas recess on Saturday . In the ? redrafted ? resolution of Senator Moses the " understanding " concerning the Monroe Doctrine expressed in the original resolution will be the chief feature , although probably phrased in new language . As it appeared in the original draft this phrase declared that the Senate " understands " that the treaty " does not impose any limitations upon the Monroe Doctrine or the traditional policies of the United States . " The other provisions expressed the " understanding " of the Senate " that the treaty imposes no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punitive Measures against any offending nation ; that the treaty does not impair the right the United States to defend its territory , possessions , trade or interests ; that the treaty does not obligate the United States to the conditions of any other treaty to which the United States is not a party . " Much of the delay in reporting the treaty from the Committee on Foreign Relations has been due to a diversity of views among Senators generally as to what it will accomplish or is expected to accomplish . Like most other important . subjects that come before the Senate , the pact has brought to light suggestions born of political timidity . A good many Senators seem to have no definite views as to what course should be taken , whether it should be ratified as it stands or should be qualified by some such resolution as that offered by Senator Moses . There is no sentiment for attaching reservations to the document . Certain Senators contend that it means nothing but say they will vote for ratification , feeling that if it can do no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view that it should be . made clear that the United States will not become involved through the treaty in any European imbroglios and that- especial care must be taken that any punitive or coercive measures taken by the League of Nations or by signatories of the Locarno treaties against a nation violating the provisions of the League Covenant or the Locarno agreements must not involve the United States through its adherence to the pact renouncing war . Most of those who hold such views are inclined to insist that unless it is certain that our rights under the Monroe Doctrine are not limited by the treaty a resolution accompanying ratification should set forth that it does not prohibit us from exercising a free-hand in any emergency which might endanger , the Doctrine . But in spite of this diversity of opinion , it is becoming increasingly evident that the treaty stands more than an even chance of being ratified ' without any qualifying declaration whatever . The belief exists that the resolution of Senator Moses will be voted down . In that event the Cove- ! nant will be ratified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-thirds vote to ratify and any fear on the part . of its most enthusiastic supporters that it will be approved by only a few votes over and above the required two-thirds seems to have passed . President Coolidge is insisting to Senators with whom he has discussed the situation that it is incumbent on the Senate to ratify ? the treaty without any qualification . He holds that as it was fathered by this government , it contains all the safeguards of American interests that are necessary and does not need clarification . In his view it would be the height of inconsistency and unwisdom for the United States to modify the terms after the negotiation had been conducted by our government . The correspondence exchanged between ' the signatory powers while the treaty was being framed and Secretary Kellogg 's speech analyzing its provisions are regarded by the President as assurance to the Senate and the American people that the doctment contains every safeguard of American rights , including our rights under the Monroe Doctrine . That there will be criticism of the cruiser bill on the ground that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - heavy increase in naval strength is evident , but the administration and . many Senators insist that there is nothing inconsistent in this course . It was the expectation yesterday that the Senate would pass today Senator Hawes 's bill prohibiting the shipment of convict-made goods into States which forbid their manufacture ? and sale , but when the Senate adjourned this evening the bill was still under debate . When the Hawes measure has been acted on the cruiser bill will come forward automatically . Then will arise the clash between those in charge of ? the cruiser program and those who lead in the effort to ratify the treaty unless an agreement is reached in the meantime to allocate part of each legislative day to each . There is reason ' to believe that if the cruiser bill 's advocates refuse to give opportunity for ' the i consideration of the pact , the cruiser bill will have a hard road to travel , with the likelihood of great delay in bringing it to a vote .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
