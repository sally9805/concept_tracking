When little Tom , Dick and Harry and their female counterparts , Mary , Jane and Joan , gathered around the breakfast table one morning last week , according to their several dispositions , they found their parents reading with serious mien the editorial page of The New York World . Little did they know what seemingly diabolical plots were being hatched against them . Had it been otherwise , their post-toasties , shredded wheat or bran would have been pushed aside in a paroxysm of childish petulance . <P> The educational problems posed by the World concerned only New York City , where the perplexing question of finding a seat in school " for every child " has been miserably embroiled in the maelstrom of party politics . But the subject , the principles involved arc germane to almost every large city in the U. S. <P> The World asked two questions : <P> 1 ) How can a more intensive use be made of school buildings to lessen the frightful building costs ? <P> 2 ) How can the number of teachers and students in school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Then the World answered these questions : <P> It is absurd for New York City to retain a school calendar devised for the purpose of releasing big boys from rural school for haying and harvesting . It is absurd for healthy children in high school to have a ten weeks ' summer vacation , with weeks off at Christmas and Easter , when their hard-worked fathers , who pay for it all , get little or none . <P> The italics are not the World 's . <P> It is absurd and humiliating that American children of equal intelligence lag two years behind their more favored contemporaries in the better class of European schools . <P> It is absurd that the billion-dollar investment in school buildings is dark so much of the time . <P> It is worse than absurd , it is an educational crime , that our poor children who are not going on to college have not as much educational opportunity as would easily be possible before they get to work . <P> It is a cruel joke that the State , which decrees compulsory education within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student , forbidden to work , is barred out of school more than a quarter of his share of fleeting time . <P> As the World would have it , there would be shorter vacations or none , better education , better use of the public money by a longer use of the public schools . That is the economics of the situation . ' The psychological and physiological factors are reconciled in another proposal .
