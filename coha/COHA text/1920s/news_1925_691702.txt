I understand there is a likelihood of this road being taken over PIA one of the large coast lines and should like to know whether there is any truth in A. F. There is a possibility of the Norfolk Southern being taken over by one of the larger systems with which it connects , most probably Southern Railway . But , as expressed by the chairman of the board , Mr. Williams , to us , it is the intention of the present management to build up the earning power of the property before placing it on the market for sale . Of course , this does not mean that a good offer now would be turned down . Both gross and net earnings of the company have been running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was $3,746,764 , against $4,098,150 in 1924 ; and surplus after charges was $102,924 , against $264,885 . The present market price of the stock reflects somewhat the road 's merger prospects . We would be inclined to await the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission on the matter of limiting the scope of the Nickel Plate hearing , before investing in this stock , as this will probably have an important bearing on future railroad mergers .
