txt Professor ELLSWORTH HUNTINGTON has put the heating and ventilating engineers in the same category with Prometheus , the firebringer , and the inventors of clothes and the first builders of houses as substitutes for caves as dwellings . He sees these engineers as potential pioneers in the extension of civilization by . warming areas all the way to the Pole and so conquering the whole stretch of climate in its original meaning , for " climate " was to the Greeks the entire " slope " from the Equator to the Pole . These successors of Prometheus even remake the climate of the so-called temperate zones . Here is the syllogism by which this authority lifts these much contemned benefactors of the race to their rightful place in the civilization which they do so much to expand : The distribution of civilization Is very closely connected with the distribution of human energy . Energy in turn depends very largely upon health and health upon climate . Several years ago Professor HUNTINGTON defined the " best climate " as one where the temperature ranges from not much below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. by day in Summer and where the storms which bring changes are frequent . This definition comes near describing what even , the weather forecasters have difficulty in predicting for this vicinity . The engineers , according to Professor HUNTINGTON 'S thesis , ought not to do too much to equalize conditions . Sudden drops of temperature seem to be beneficial to health and promotive of energy ? " almost invariably stimulating . " There must , of course , be rises in order that there may be drops , yet a moderate change from day to day will suffice to give the bloat desirable variability ? a change of three degrees in mean temperature from day to day , which should be within the range of indoor control , at any rate , for these masters of heat and air currents . The indications are that man 's original home was in a region where he had to adapt  --  himself to a variable climate , on pain of disappearing . One evidence that these variable climatic conditions existed in the common birthplace of mankind is that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arctic Circle and Italians from sunny Italy " have best health " and greatest energy under practi " tally the same conditions , " that is , such as are found where the temperature variations are those which constitute " the best climate , " as defined above . This adaptation to climate seams to be a " deep-seated " physiological fact like the uniform " ity of the temperature of the blood " in all races . " With the low temperatures ' of the higher latitudes the heat engineer has his one factor of the ideal climate already provided . The other factor he is enabling man to use so effectually that he can be , temporarily at least . comfortable even at the Pole . Man has followed the isothermal lines of the Temperate Zones ' around the globe . It ' remains for him to climb to higher latitudes by . following the isocheimal lines , and , as . Professor . HUNTINGTON suggests inquiringly , move tale centre of civilization still further north .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
