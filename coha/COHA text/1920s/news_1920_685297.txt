" I never had any unkindly feeling or anything along that line that the quotation could indicate . He said he knew that I was anti-British . I do n't think I ever had a conversation with him along that line . My attitude then was cne of enthusiastic co-operation . I deny now any unfriendly feeling . I feel that a great injustice has been done me that should be corrected .
