ONE shudders a bit at the very thought of an economic evaluation of life . How much is a mother , a wife , or a child worth ? The very words leave one cold ; for life in its full implications is not commensurable with money . Life and health have a much higher and deeper value for us than money ; in fact , they give value to everything else . Life and health are ends in themselves . They do not require any further justification for their conservation . If , therefore , in this paper I appear to evaluate life and health in terms of dollars and cents , it is not because that is the only way of evaluating them . I am simply attempting to place a money value on one very narrow aspect of life , namely , its actual cost to maintain , and its productive value in terms of dollars and cents . In this sense alone , life and health have economic value , and their evaluation on this basis should render a real service to those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us Americans to emphasize the importance of our national wealth but always in terms of real property , machinery , and of manufactured products . We quite forget that human life exceeds in value all such goods by a very large margin . Human capital is the nation 's greatest asset . No wonder that we are wasteful of our human resources . We appreciate the value of life and health only when we lose them . It is when earnings cease through illness , and expenses mount that we recognize the value of life and health . It is when the breadwinner of a family - iremoved through accident or disease and the mother and young children must become self-supporting that , first the dependents , and later the community , realize the large capital value which has been lost . But , even if such circumstances bring us the realization of the value of the individual , we give ordinarily little thought to the value of our living assets as a whole . We express in a hundred ways this indifference and lack of understanding . We are free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed with expenditures that are intended to conserve life and health . We do not realize how great are the immediate possibilities for saving our human resources and how profitable an investment life conservation can be . To lay a foundation for the proper understanding of the economics of life and health it is necessary first to determine some items in the cost of human life and to discover also the net value of the earnings of average individuals . For a number of years my associates and I have been engaged in making a series of computations along these lines . Our first task was to calculate what it costs to bring up a child in a typical American community to age 18 when he may become self-supporting . Our computations were for the great body of wage-earning families of the country whose total family resources are about $2,500 a year . Under present conditions the cost of rearing a child in such families to the age of self-support , including all the usual items of food , shelter , clothing , education , etc. , etc. , is $7,238 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cost of those who do not survive age 18 , the amount is increased to a little more than $10,000 . This amount does not include one very important item , namely , the money value of the mother 's care . We were compelled to limit ourselves to the family 's money income , but we recognize that the working mother makes a real contribution to the total income of the family ; for if wages were to be paid commensurate with the mother 's value in the bringing up of children , the sum would he considerable and would add materially to the $10,000 actually spent by the family in raising a child to self-support . Our figure is , therefore , a minimum and will serve to keep our other calculations conservative . The cost of bringing up a child may be looked upon as capital invested which will produce future returns . The process of raising children may be compared with winding up a piece of machinery which is later expected to do useful work . From an economic standpoint the bringing up of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment not so much for the immediate family as for the community as a whole . The great majority of adults produce a good deal more than they consume and add to the capital value of the communities in which they live . If this were not so , the total national wealth would not increase as rapidly as it has during the last century . Our second effort accordingly was to compute the value of a man as a wage earner , that is , to determine the returns from the investment in human capital . Our computation proceeded with the same group of people , namely , those who were in the $2,500 income class . We did not include the money equivalent of the wife 's services . But , disregarding this item , we found that the present worth at age 18 of his future earnings was calculated well in excess of $41,000 , and the present worth of his future expenditures less than $13,000 . The present worth at age 18of the net future earnings of a man in this economic class was accordingly close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income class is reached at age 25 , when the present worth of his net future earnings is more than $32,000 . With advancing age , the present worth of net future earnings declines . At 50 , it is $17,510 ; at 60 , about $8,500 . After age 70 , the present worth of net future earnings is negative because earnings cease and the cost of maintenance continues . An astonishing item in our calculations is the high economic value of a child at birth . We found the sum to he $9,333 . This is the amount which it would be necessary to put at interest at three and a half per cent , in order to bring up the child to age 18 and to produce the net income throughout the working-period of life . At age 5 , the corresponding figure is $14,156 and at age 15 , $2.5,341 . If we had assumed a higher rate of interest than three and a half per cent , the amounts would have been correspondingly smaller ; at four and a half per cent , the value at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case , the money value of children is no small matter . They represent , in a sense , the value of the social inheritance which comes to a human being because he is born in an economically organized state . In the same manner , we computed the value of a man whose maximum earnings are $5,000 a year . This represents a fairly large group of professional and small business men who have had better opportunities to advance themselves than their fellows . At age 18 , the present worth of the net future earnings of a man in this group was found to be $34,320 . The actual maximum value occurs at age 32 when the net future earnings are worth $49,100 . The $2,500 man reaches his maximum value seven years earlier at the age of 25 , but his value as a producer is then $17,000 less . The value of a child at birth in this group is $9,629 and at the other ages of childhood the figures are only a little more than those I have quoted for the children in the $2,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of bringing up a child in the higher income class . It costs money to raise human beings to the point of self-support , at least $10,000 , as we have seen . When they begin to work they produce a great deal more than they cost . We have calculated from the data which I have just presented to you ? the value of males in the $2,500 income class ? what the sixty million male persons in the United States are worth . That is , we have computed , with regard to their present ages , the sum of their net future earnings . The aggregate figure is considerably over a thousand billion dollars . Unfortunately , we are not able to compute with the same exactness the economic value of the female population because the housewife 's contribution to the family budget can not be measured in dollars and cents . But , there are more than eight million gainfully occupied women in the United States , and those that are not gainfully employed have decided economic value to their families and to the State . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general is only one-half that of men , this will make the value of that sex 500 billions and the total vital assets , males and females combined , over 1,500 billion dollars . Our national wealth in material assets in me was 321 billion dollars . This includes real property , live stock , machinery , agricultural and mining products , and manufactured goods of all sorts . Our vital capital , therefore , exceeded our ordinary material wealth about five to one . This striking relationship between living capital , on the one hand , and material capital , on the other , is not limited to the United States , although it is possible that the difference between the two may not be as great in some other countries . Professor Nicholson , as far hack as 1891 , estimated that the living capital of the United Kingdom was five times that of all other capital . It would be a laborious task to determine the corresponding figure for England and Wales at the present time or to check up the figures for other nations . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtainable in all civilized countries . For , even if human values , man for man , are economically lower in other lands than in our own because of lower per capita production and lower wages , the same relationship probably holds between live capital on the one hand and other forms of wealth on the other . In any case , we must see very clearly how great is the value of human life the world over . The figures I have quoted suggest how necessary it is to give due consideration to au effort to conserve this , the most valuable of our national resources . With these figures as a background , we are now in a position to realize somewhat the losses which result annually from the interruptions due to illness and death . Our bodies are , after all , machines which need occasional overhauling . They wear out sooner or Later , depending a good deal upon the care they receive . Sickness is one of the commonest of the facts of life and one of the most disturbing , as it interferes with production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to estimate the total economic loss sustained in this country on account of illness . Some years ago Doctor Frankel and I made a series of studies on the extent of sickness among a half million insured persons . The figures showed that about two per cent were constantly sick . Other observers , following similar methods , have confirmed our results , namely , that the average individual in the United States loses about seven days each year from sickness involving inability to work . There are additional days of discomfort which interfere more or Tess with a person 's duties , but these were not included in the statistics . Converted into economic terms , this means that there is a loss of two per cent of total current production . This , in round numbers , amounts to more than a billion and a quarter dollars annually in the United States . To this figure should be added the cost of such items as medical care , hospital service , drugs and appliances , and the like . To ascertain the extent of these expenditures we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people and found that the average annual expenditure was $19 per capita for medical and nursing care and other items necessary in illness . This figure is probably higher than the average for the general population because the group studied had a rather favorable economic status . But , even if half this figure be used , say in round numbers $10 per capita , the total cost of medical care , including all items , would amount to more than a billion dollars a year . We may , therefore , say with confidence that sickness costs directly in lost wages , in reduced production , as well as in the necessary care , a total of two and a quarter billion dollars a year . Huge as these figures are , they do not cover the total which should be placed to the account of illness . In many instances sickness causes premature death , removing individuals in their prime when they have real and large economic values . Somehow , we must evaluate the total community losses which result from this item of premature death . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur every year , even under the present conditions , are preventable . To be sure , the great bulk of such preventable deaths are in infancy and childhood . But I have shown you that even at these younger ages human beings have considerable monetary value . Every year 120 thousand babies die from altogether preventable conditions during the first year of their life . There is no reason for this slaughter except the ignorance of mothers and the indifference of the communities wherethey live . Possibly it might make a difference if our legislators realized that these babies have a capital value of more than $9,000 if they arc boys , and of $4,600 if they are girls , and that the capital lost throughout the country from this preventable infant mortality reached the astounding figure of more than three-quarters of a billion dollars a year . If there are those who question my mathematics , I can still counter by recalling that there are enough preventable deaths of adult men and women which would make a real impression on economic production , to say nothing of the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year more than 30,000 young men and women between 25 and 29 years of age die from entirely preventable causes , and their . capital value , having in mind their net future earnings , is about three-quarters of a billion dollars . Having due regard for the value of life at each age period , I estimate that the total capital value of the lives which can be saved annually through the application of modern preventive medicine and public-health measures is over six billions of dollars . The losses , as you see , from sickness and preventable death are enormous , as one might very well expect in view of the immense value of human life in the United States . One would think under such conditions that no effort would be spared to conserve our living resources : But we have scratched only the surface of the possibilities in this direction . It would be quite unfair , however , to give the impression that nothing has been accomplished . The gains in extending human life and preventing sickness have been really considerable during the last half-century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public-health authorities to prevent illness and to conserve life , considered from a purely economic viewpoint , pays large dividends . Let us take the situation in a city like New York . The results are fairly typical of what has happened in other large centers of population . In 1875 , the death rate was 28.3 per 1,000 ; in 19l5 , it was 11.5 , or a reduction of 59.4 per cent . A better measure of the improvement is perhaps the gain in average duration of life . In 1880 , the average life-span was about 40 years in New York City and most likely in other urban centers in the United States . It is now 55 or 56 years , a gain of about 15 years in less than a half-century . The greatest gains have been achieved recently . In 1901 a baby born in the U. S. Registration Area might expect to live 49.24 years ; this expectation of life has now risen to 57.32 years . The present figures are not accidental but the result of a definite trend which has been fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new force in the life of the people . It will be interesting to examine the facts of the death rate for a number of the more important causes . The diseases which have been most reduced are those which affect infants and young children . In the last twenty years , the infant mortality rate has been cut 60 per cent . In the past one might almost have said that babies were born to die , for as many as one quarter of them did not survive the first year . To-day , in most American communities , only about 7 per cent die during that first difficult year and two-thirds of these deaths will be prevented in the near future . Not long ago typhoid fever was a common cause of sickness and death throughout the United States . Even as late as 1900 the death rate was 36 per 100,000 in the Registration Area . Epidemics raged in the large cities of the country because of polluted water supplies and because little was done to prevent the spread of the disease through secondary infection . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger cities of the country , the typhoid-fever death rate dropped in an amazing manner . This disease is now not far from extinction , certainly in the northern and urban sections of the country . The public-health campaign has been especially successful in the reduction of tuberculosis . In 1900 , the death rate from this disease was 195 per 100,000 . It is now less than one-half as high . More than 100,000 people are kept alive each year who under the old conditions would have succumbed to this disease alone . Diphtheria is another disease which the public health movement is on the point of wiping out completely . At the end of the last century this was one of the most important causes of death among children . When the first Registration figures became available in 1900 , this disease had a death rate of 43.3 per 100,000 ; in 192s , this was reduced to 1e.1 , and it is rapidly dropping everywhere throughout the country . To-day we are considering seriously the possibility of the complete elimination of diphtheria by 1930 in such large areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application of known methods of prevention such as the general inoculation of children with toxin-antitoxin will completely conquer this scourge of childhood . Possibly the most striking demonstration of the effectiveness of the modern health campaign is the experience of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company with its millions of Industrial policy holders . Seventeen years ago , this organization instituted a program of health education and of nursing service for its working-class members . This business organization has expended altogether over twenty millions of dollars in this campaign . It has increased its annual budget for welfare work in response to an ever-increasing demand for service and also to the increasingly favorable results of the work done . For during this period the mortality rate has declined more than 30 per cent and the accumulated saving in mortality between 1911 and 1925 , which can be ascribed only to the welfare work of the Company , has totalled the amazing sum of 43 millions of dollars , or twice the total expended . During this period of the demonstration the death rate from tuberculosis among the Industrial policy holders has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reduction has been about 80 per cent ; from the communicable diseases of childhood , the reduction was 55.5 per cent , and from diphtheria alone , the reduction was over 62 per cent since 1911 . In every important condition the death rate has declined among the Industrial policy holders fully twice as fast as has occurred in the general population . As a result , the expectation of life of this group of workers and their families has increased by nine years during the interval , whereas the corresponding increase in the general population is about five years . Health work , when properly undertaken and adequately financed , pays by every test of a modern business organization . IV These achievements in the field of public health , both official and private , have completely changed the life of the average citizen in the modern State . People in our country , at least , no longer live in dread of the plague , of cholera , of yellow fever , of virulent smallpox , or of pernicious malaria , and a host of other specters. if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to round out a good expectation of years , to bring up their families , and otherwise to live a normal and happy life . Never , probably , in the history of the world has there been such widespread wellbeing for great masses of people . This is , I believe , in large measure , the response to the great improvement in health conditions which has occurred . Increased efficiency and huge productivity , uninterrupted by illness or preventable death , have ushered in many advantages which follow from a high level of economic wellbeing . In spite of these achievements , there is still a large field to cultivate . Tuberculosis still causes a hundred thousand deaths annually and a loss of about two and a half years in the average expectation of life of the entire community . If this disease could be eliminated just that number of years would be added to the expectation of every member of society . Accidental deaths are becoming more frequent with the extension of the use of the automobile and the development of industry . The elimination of accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . A goodly proportion of the deaths from heart disease , certainly those which occur at the younger ages , are preventable , and their prevention would add appreciably to the life span . And , thus in its entirety , if we were but willing to utilize the knowledge which we have of preventive medicine , in the life of the American people , we should raise the expectation of life from its present point of 57 or 58 years to close to 65 . The discovery of a method to control cancer and a few other obscure diseases would further increase this expectation appreciably . But , even if we discount these future discoveries and limit ourselves to the application of such knowledge as we now have and which is only waiting to be applied , an average duration of life of 65 years is an entirely possible one for the American people . The people of New Zealand are very close to such an achievement at the present time . What they can do , we with our superior resources can do likewise . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know how great is the value of human life . We know also how great are the current losses from sickness and death . We have the knowledge and the necessary resources for the control of disease . Obviously , we must put our knowledge to work . That is the program of the public-health movement of the immediate future . To-day , public-health work is in its infancy in spite of its achievements and the demonstration of its power . Most American communities still have pol i ti cal health administrat ions , inadequately financed , inadequately manned . Less than fifty cents per capita probably represents the total expenditure of the American people for public health . The money spent for medical service is almost altogether for the care of disease and not for its prevention . The relationship were better reversed . A new era of intensive public-health work must be brought about which will make available to the American people the power of this new branch of science . Expert opinion of public-health officials indicates that an expenditure of $2.50 per capita wisely directed through organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the annual death rate two points per thousand and correspondingly increase the expectation from five to seven years . The money value of these added years of life as we have seen , runs into billions of dollars . There is no greater opportunity for a quick and more certain return on any investment than an investment in public health . The people of the United States and , in fact , of the whole world have not waked up to the enormous possibilities of profit in preserving life and health . V I am not unmindful of the fact that my subject is the economics of world health and that I have given very Iittle consideration to other countries than the United States . This I have done because , as an American , I am most interested in the United States , and also because our country presents a rich detail of data not always present for other countries of the world . We can fortunately establish a basis for the development of an international viewpoint on health matters through the consideration of American conditions . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I shall say a word with regard to that . Much the same conditions exist to-day the world over , although countries vary somewhat with regard to the prevalenceof disease , the expectation of Iife , and the economic value of their citizens . But , everywhere there is a great opportunity for the extension of health and for the prolongation of life and the increase of capital assets . It was in England that the modern public-health program took form and developed ; and it is not surprising to find that among the English-speaking peoples the very best conditions of longevity and productivity occur . It is in far-away New Zealand that the longest average life time is found . The expectation of life at birth is more than 62 years in that country , and only a little less in Australia . The Scandinavian countries , Denmark , Norway , and Sweden , which very early applied the newer public-health procedures , have conditions very much like those of the United States , perhaps even a shade better , namely , an average expectation at birth of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures , with an average of about 55 years ; France , Germany , Italy and Japan before the War had expectations varying from 45 to 48 years , or about ten years less than our own country . India stands at the very bottom of the list of the countries of the world , with an expectation of about 23 years . These figures are the best basis of comparison we have for the wellbeing and prosperity of the nations of the world . Where life is long , debilitating sickness is less prevalent and economic production is highest . The extraordinary prosperity which has been witnessed in the United States is , in large measure , the result of the control which has been exercised over disease ; of the freedom which men and women have attained to labor without interruption and without fear ; the opportunity that our children have gained to grow up in the care of father and mother , amply supplied with the necessities of life and preserved from the trials and sorrows of broken families . Where , as in India , the duration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death , and of crippling , and of invalidism . The capital spent in bringing up children is largely wasted because so few reach maturity to continue their full productivity for a period long enough to pay for themselves , with no thought of adding to the wealth of their country . No greater service can be rendered to insure the general peace and prosperity than to improve the world 's health . In this field of labor there are no international jealousies , but rather international obligations and opportunities . A low standard of health in any country is a menace to all its neighbors ; in fact , to the whole world . It was because Europe and America were indifferent to the existence of influenza centers in Asia that this disease could later spread to all the world , causing more damage to life than the Great War . Prevention of disease and the prolongation of life for the people of India , for example , will bring prosperity to all the nations that have dealings with them ; for the people of India will become better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole world . It is obviously , therefore , to the interest of the leading nations ? those who have enjoyed greater advantages and opportunities in health work ? to make available these advantages to those who are backward and to those who lack financial ability to institute progressive measures on their own account . The International Health Board , the Health Organization of the League of Nations , and those other bodies which function in international health service are at the very forefront in bringing nations together on a higher plane . Such work creates a better understanding between nations and increases mutual trust and respect . What concerns the health of the people touches after all the most responsive chord in the heart of mankind .
