The final strength of parties will not be known until after the new Reichstag ( elected a fortnight ago ) meets on May 22 . The Socialists , according to late information , obtained 100 seats , and the Nationalists 96 . The latter , however , claim nine votes of the Landbund Party , which would give them 105 seats and make them the largest party in the Reichstag . This question is to be settled by vote of the Reichstagers . <P> President Ebert held conference with Chancellor Marx regarding the elections ( TIME , May 12 ) . Much doubt was evinced in political circles as to which party would be asked to form a government , but the choice lay have been Chancellor Marx and Dr. Oskar Hergt , leader of the Nationalists . The Government will of necessity be a coalition and it was widely recognized that the Nationalists would have to be represented in order that the Government can muster a two-thirds majority necessary co passing the Dawes report . <P> Meanwhile , Dr. Hergt issued a manifesto on behalf of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stating that his party , if in power , would not sign promises unless it could fulfill them . He wanted certain reservations made , the precise nature of which were not known ; but he stated that his attitude by no means presupposed rejection . As utter chaos stares Germany in the face , if she reject the Dawes plan , its ultimate passage is certain . This was recognized by moderates of all Parties . The torrent of editorials in the American press to the effect that the election was to test the Republican sentiment of the country is incorrect . The big issue was financial reconstruction . The Extreme Monarchists were perhaps the only members of parties committed to overthrowing the Republic , and they were in the minority . <P> When completed , the new Reichstag will have about 475-485 members. * Of these , Centrists , German People 's Party and the variously-opinioned Nationalists number about 300 . All these actually favor a return to monarchial government , but most of them support the Republic . The new Reichstag is , therefore , predominantly Monarchist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> *The German electoral system apportions one deputy for every 60,000 votes cast , hence the number of deputies fluctuates with each election .
