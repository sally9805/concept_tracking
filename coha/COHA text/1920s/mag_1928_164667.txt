BLACK DEMOCRACY , the Story of Haiti -H . P. Davis-Dial Press ( $5.00 ) . <P> The History . Utterly out of proportion to Haiti 's size and importance are the spectacular dramatics of its history . In 1492 Columbus discovered it , marveled at its extraordinary beauty and fertility , bartered beads and gaudy bracelets for pretty gold-dust friendly " Indians " had found . But the Spaniards ' brutality reduced these Indians to a paltry number and , needing laborers , they began importing large numbers of Africans . Before long the color line was so loosely drawn that very few of Santo Domingo 's inhabitants could boast unmixed blood . Added to Spanish , Creoles and blacks , were soon the French and English traders , and by the end of the 18th Century French control was so well in the ascendency that Haiti contributed vast wealth to the kingdom of France . <P> But with the French Revolutionists ' declaration of the Rights of Man , the black slaves of Haiti , in all consistency , revolted against their masters-rich Creoles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre-Dominique Toussaint L'Ouverture , First of the Blacks , established in 1801 an independent constitution . He was well under way with a promising period of reconstruction when Napoleon took time to consider his refractory colonies . A swift intelligent military campaign subdued Toussaint 's able generals . Toussaint himself was taken unscrupulously by ruse , and imprisoned in France-to be mourned in lines by Wordsworth . <P> Tropical fever was meanwhile ravaging French troops , and , Napoleon being engrossed by troubles at home , Toussaint 's best general was able to declare independence . Only 13 years before , all the land and 90% of the population was owned by a small oligarchy of whites . Now no white owned land , and all the havocked property passed to ex-slaves . Making himself emperor in the grand manner , Jean Jacques Dessalines governed these ignorants by the universally understood authority of force , but he was murdered for brutal abuse of power . Among his simultaneous successors was black King Christophe , most picturesque of Haitians. * <P> Followed a century of terrific political upheaval . Tortures and carnage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American intervention . For in spite of unrest , foreign financial investments had reached proportions requiring protection . America took control first of the customs , then of national finance , and virtually all other administration , with " no object in view except to insure . . . firm government by the Haitian people . " <P> The Significance . Masses of economic reports , period studies , impassioned tirades , colorful sketches , have long since reflected the atmosphere of Haiti , but the present volume is the first authentic , comprehensive history of the island . The past established , Mr. Davis proceeds to sort out the truth from the array of scandal and propaganda that has befogged the present Haitian problem . He stultifies prevalent accusations of graft . He gives America full credit for feats of rehabilitation , agriculture , public health , policing and education , in the face of such stupendous difficulties as 95% illiteracy . But in no uncertain terms he flays American failure to prepare Haitians for the independent self-government which will be theirs , according to treaty , in 1936.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
