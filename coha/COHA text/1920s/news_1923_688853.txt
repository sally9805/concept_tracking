txt Magistrate CORRIGAN is right . There should be " an honest , full and fear " less investigation by a committee of " the Legislature " of the administration by the police force of the MullanGage law . The community is sick of the long tempest of denunciations and personalities , the investigation of men who dare to make charges , the impartial spirit and gracious methods of the Commissioner of Accounts , the whole ex parte fury and clutter , in defense as well as attack there has been too much intemperance of speech . The public wants the facts . Has there been police graft or has there not ? There is no occasion for excitement or surprise if there has been . Under the old excise laws it existed and sometimes flourished . . It can Scarcely be expected that pro- ' hibitiop has created a new breed of impeccable angels . If there are now " intolerable conditions " under the Mullan-Gage law , they are not a convincing indictment of that law . Laws on this subject have always been attended with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iS not to repeal the law , but to drive out corruption , if it is established .. Some of the testimony elicited by the hostile Commissioner of Accounts in the sailors ' boarding house case , the hearing of which will be resumed today , is disturbing , and the public knows that the persons who pay graft have good reasons for keeping their own counsel , as far as possible . At any rate , here are obvious opportunities of graft . A certain mystery has seemed to surround the proceedings of the police or their detachment to duty in cabarets and caf ? s . In the public mind suspicion and uneasiness , however unjustified , prevail . The honor of the police force is involved . Commissioner ENRIGHT and Mayor HYLAN ought to welcome an inquiry by a legislative committee , whose power of protecting witnesses is indispensable to an adequate gathering of the facts . The Legislature , fortunately divided between the ' two parties , ' is in the best position to make through a joint committee an impartial , unpartisan investigation . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Meyer committee , L , thPre in r ' . " e ' - or for it now . The . fiext.rnunicipal election is a long way off , and it will be possible to make a search for graft without consideratidn of ? campaign material . " There is no intention or effort to " discredit " Mayor- myr.dov 's Administration . If the inquiry reveals little or nothing to reflect on the police , that will redound to6 his triumph . If it reveals graft ? Which , to sonic extent , is found even under the most flawless administration ? he and the Commissioner of Police will have the glory of reforming an evil the mere general surmise of which is injurious to them . But no man 's and no party 's political fortunes should be considered . for a moment in the matter . The Integrity of the police is questioned . The sale by some enforcers of the law of the privilege to violate the law is charged . It la time to have done with all this thundering in the index and cope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
