" Poke in the Nose " <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Your excellent paper has been coming to my home for three years and my aunt and I have always enjoyed reading it . ... BUT-why in heaven 's name did you print such an unpatriotic letter as that of Sidney Henderson of Chicago in regard to our excellent President 's flight with Lindbergh ? ( TIME , April 9 ) . In the first place , the letter was decidedly of a sarcastic tone ; in the next place he dares to imply that Coolidge is lacking in moral courage and sportsmanship . I 'd like to be near enough to Henderson to give him a poke in the nose ! I 'll bet Henderson has not taken an air-trip over to Paris more than fifty times ( ? ) . It gets under my skin to read a letter like Henderson has written and it riles me more to think you would print one like it . . . . Men like Coolidge and Lindbergh are not produced every day , but men like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I am trying to pick a fight , I just want to condemn the general tone and contents of Henderson 's letter as an unpatriotic utterance and say that there is no glory in patting a wife and mother on the back and saying : " Your son or husband died a hero . " That does not bring them back . What good would it do for Coolidge to take a flight ? He 's not seeking publicity . He does not need it . He 's known and loved throughout the world and I say this although I am a Democrat at heart . I 'd vote for a Republican as fine as Coolidge any day . <P> Kindly do not clutter up your paper any more with letters like Henderson 's . If you do not publish this so he can read it , please give me his address and I 'll give him a piece of a woman 's mind and you know what that will mean when a woman really gets her Irish temper up . <P> Nevertheless I wish you success . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No Dignity <P> Sirs : <P> I wish to reply to the letters in your magazine on April 9 and 23 suggesting that President Coolidge take a flight with Colonel Lindbergh . The writers of those letters were lacking in dignity . TIME also showed itself lacking in dignity to print them . You have no business to use your magazine as a medium for making personal suggestions to the President of the United States . I have no doubt that Colonel Lindbergh would be a safe pilot for any man , great or small ; but that is no reason why President Coolidge should have his life made more difficult with continual nagging . . . . <P> I read TIME for the facts it gives me . ... GEORGE A. WATSON <P> Kansas City , Mo . <P> <P> Mr. Brand <P> Sirs : <P> Enclosed please find a release covering the circumstances which caused me to ask Secretary <P> Hoover to consider the vacancy of Secretary of Agriculture . <P> You wrote the nastiest article that was published on this subject ' ' Burnt Brand , " TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how far you were justified . <P> CHAS .
