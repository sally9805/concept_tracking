The method of forcing a balance between the manufacturing costs and selling costs of fabrics which New Bedford and neighboring Taunton , Mass. , textile makers adopted last week was to reduce wages . The New Bedford Silk Mills cut pay by 25% , and at once 140 employes walked out . Twenty-seven cotton mills announced 10% pay cuts for the beginning of this past week and 2,571 mill hands immediately voted to go on strike . The three local newspapers are condemning both wage reductions and strike .
