txt William G. , whose withdrawal from the race for the Dem- ' ocratic nomination for President was anno- : ced on Saturday . and Edwin T. Meredith of Des Moines , Iowa , former Secretary of Agriculture , who is regarded by many as the heir presumptive of what remains of the strength , were both in New York City yesterday . Their simultaneous presence here led to the assumption by interested Democrats that a conference was in progress or in prospect to see what could be done to head off the growing movement for the nomination of Governor Alfred E. Smith . Whether or not Mr. and Mr. Meredith met during the day could not be determined , because neither of them could be found . At Mr. 's apartment in the Hotel Plaza it was said that he was out and would not return until late at night . A relative of Mr. Meredith furnished the information that Mr. and Mrs. Meredith were in the suburbs over Sunday but refused to reveal their exact whereabouts . Later it was found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where it was said that Mr. Meredith would not return until late last night . In his letter to George F. Milton , publisher of The Chattanooga News , ' announcine. that he would not be a candidate for the nomination next year , Mr. indicated that he expected to continue his interest in politics and take part in the fight for what he called progressive Democracy and said he believed it was time to clear the way for another leadership of the party group which he had beaded . Move to Unite Anti-Smith Element . In the belief of prominent Democrats here , Mr 's declaration has cleared the way for an attempt to unite the elements of the party opposed to the nomination of Governor Smith , and it is considered quite likely that Mr. Meredith will he chosen as one of the candidates of these elements . Mr. Meredith , who is the publisher of Successful Farming , an exten lively circulated farm journal , is expected to appeal to the agrarian West and to receive considerable support in the South , but , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of three candidates who will receive the support of those opposed to Governor Smith . in a drive to prevent Governor Smith from getting the nomination . The two other candidates , whose claims will be put forward during the next few months , according to a Democrat not unfriendly to Governor Smith but not in favor of his nomination , will be Senator Thomas J. Walsh of Montana , and Senator James A. Reed of Missouri . It was said that the situation , feared by Governor Smith and his friends , that of being so far in front that combinations would be formed against him , had already developed , and that from now on the efforts of those opposed to the Governor 's nomination would be to pick out of the three foregoing candidates the one who would be the strongest in each State and to concentrate , not as much in getting delegates for Mr. Meredith , Senator Walsh or Senator Reed , as in getting delegates against Governor Smith . Reed Campaign to Be Revived . With that end in view , it was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South and West . Senator Reed , according to information received by friends here , will make a declaration of his personal political principles in a speech at the Missouri State Fair at Sedalia on Thursday . In this speech , Senator Reed is expected to enunciate what will amount to a personal platform . Just what he will say is not known , but one thing he will advocate is the return of the party to Jeffersonian principles , which already has been advocated by Governor Albert C. Ritchie of Maryland in repeated pleas for the solution of the prohibition question by a return to State rights . The boom for Senator Walsh seems to be partly genuine and partly inspired by former supporters who hope to use Senator Walsh to defeat Governor Smith . Senator Walsh is a Roman Catholic and a dry . Governor Smith is a Catholic and is considered , if not a wet , as in favor of a liberalization of the present prohibition laws . The plan of some of those supporting Senator Walsh is to put him forward as an available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry States of the South and West . His candidacy is expected to furnish evidence that Governor Smith , if beaten for the nomination , will not be beaten because he is a Catholic but for other reasons and to furnish solid ground for those opponents of the Governor who will insist that their opposition is not because he is a Catholic but because he is a wet . That Senator Walsh is an aspirant for the nomination is considered certain by Governor Smith 's friends , who have received definite information that Senator Walsh has told party leaders in Montana that he wished to have the support of the delegates from that State . This is a direct primary State , and in 1924 one Smith delegate , running without any support from the Smith campaign organization , was elected and voted for Governor Smith throughout the convention . In view of that , Governor Smith has been urged to enter the Montana primaries next Spring , but has told friends that he would not make a fight against Senator Walsh in the latter 's own State .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
