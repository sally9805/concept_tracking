Pr is st ill dark . But the buzzing of the night is disturbed by the bloodhounds howling in their kennels . The saddle horses begin to stamp and snort in the corral . Already the pigs squeal for the leavings of the breakfast table . The convicts stir in their bunks . Side by side they lie in long rows , four layers high , upon mattresses soaked with sweat and with the sultry mist of the Gulf . Between the two wings of the camp the picket boss peers through the bars at a trusty , who with a lantern in his hand climbs from shelf to shelf on the rickety steel structure in the centre , yelling at and poking the sleeping 11101 . Stiff , aching , fatigued from the previous day 's work and from the long trips back and forth between the ( imp and the cotton-field , the convicts molly stand in stuporous silence , waiting to be let into the adjoining dining-room : Negroes , Mexicans , and whites ; young boys of eighteen , strong , mature men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred or more , , r them rubbing elbows in each sleeping-hall . The picket boss hands a key between the bars to the turnkey , who is locked in the dining-room . The latter unlocks a heavy padlock on the door of the sleeping-hall , returns the key to the picket boss outside , and opens the door . One by one the men file past him and drop down on seats at a table that is covered with bread , molasses , beans , potatoes , and coffee , prepared outside in the awkwardly placed cookhouse . Tile seven haunting hours ahead , before the convicts will be able again to sit down , whet their appetite . Food there is in abundance ; but it is coarse and unsavory and often poorly prepared . The men devour their breakfast with gobbling glut , yet not with the relish of hungry creatures . Hurriedly they swill their coffee . Dawn is approaching . At five they must be on their way . They stretch themselves sluggishly like dumb beasts , suck their teeth , lick their lips , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the bars . They scowl at him and cringe at sight of his two six-shooters that gleam in the dim lamplight . In the prison yard fifteen mounted guards face the picket , ready to receive their charges , prepared for a long day 's vigil , each with a shotgun resting on his thigh , the barrel in the air , a six-shooter on his hip , a poncho folded across the horse 's loins , a coiled lasso and a leather braided quirt hanging on the saddle hook . In the dusky dawn the horses prance and fret , rearing on their hind legs , getting tangled in the reins and stirrups , and stirring the dust under the heavy dew . The picket boss unlocks the dining-room door and opens it wide enough for a man to squeeze through sidewise . One by one the convicts scramble out into the picket and leap clown the steps into the prison yard . The voice of the picket boss penetrates the noises of pawing hoofs and shuffling feet . ' Number one plough-squad ! One ? two ? three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they pass him . " Iwo missing , ' yells the guard of this particular squad . Who ? ' The picket boss closes the door on the rest of the convicts until the discrepancy is accounted for . A voice answers hesitatingly from the waiting plough-squad : ' Black Jack and Little Louse . " r They all have nicknames . The picket boss calls out the two names , and from somewhere within the crowded dining-room the two belated members of number one plough-squad force themselves to the door and pass out . Fourteen ? fifteen . ' Right , ' replies the guard . And off the fifteen men run as fast as their legs are able to carry them , to fetch the plough mules in the corral , while their guard comes galloping behind , holding the shotgun in his right hand and the reins in his left . Despite many halts , the checking is done as quickly as sheep are counted in a corral . Each squad with its guard , starting off , shakes the ground like a faint earthquake . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleepily ? never straddling ? on the back of a mule . Number one hoe-squad ! ' The Picket boss unlocks the door of the second dining-room . Again some of the convicts are missing , this time Tin Pan , Dirty Yellow , and Snowball , whom the captain calls the best little nigger in camp . ' The three are found finally among the waiting prisoners . They say that they are sick . Dirty Yellow is malingering again . Poor fellow ? I know what is the matter with him ! Ile has 1 . N enty licks coming on his bare back tonight . He is always in trouble . Tin Pan is given ' salts . ' Both are chased along into the cotton-field with the rest of number one hoc-squad .

I runs and he do n't hit me at all . So I gets mad and turns around and shoots him once only . And I done hit him right here , ' pointing a regretful finger at the middle of his forehead . Snowball ! You mean to tell me that your best friend shot at you three times because you did n't happen to have a match on you ? ' I asked , dubiously . No , sal . It was the way I say , " I do n't hab no match , " dat gets him so mad . ' The five hoe-squads are all accounted for and are marched out to the fields , each with a guard riding behind , and each man with a long-handled hoe on his shoulder . Pull-do-squad ! ' yells the picket boss . Cripples of all ages limp out of the dining-room and descend the steps into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm grounds . All the trusties are counted . At night they are locked up in the sleeping-hall with the rest : turnkeys , house-tenders , dining-room trusties , cooks , the captain 's servants , the hospital steward , bookkeeper , dog man , water boy , poultry man , dairy man , hog mn , broncho-breaker , laundry trusty , blacksmith , carpenter , saddlcmaker , and ma il man . Just as the upper edge of the sun appears over the distant swamps , the bookkeeper writes clown on a blackboard the daily inventory : ? 203 male prisoners 54 saddle horses 180 mules 30 bloodhounds 000 head of cattle 80 hogs 105 pigs 500 chickens 8 bulls 1 stallion 3500 acres cultivated cotton-land But at noon there are only 202 male prisoners . The convicts returning for dinner have found Snowball dead in his bunk . It is evening . The convicts are returning to camp . White dust-clouds dry up the sweat on their brows like blotting-sand on wet ink . As they pass the captain 's bungalow the Negroes tip their caps ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plough-squads ride their mules into the corral . The hoc-squads drop their hoes along the fence . One by one they all pass through the picket into the dining-room and from there into the sleeping-hall . For the fourth time that day they are counted . Two hundred and two ! ' Right ! ' Along the walls of each sleeping-hall the house-tenders are lighting the kerosene lanterns . The convicts rush to the drinking-faucet , to the shower , and to the bathing-pool beside their bunks . There they snort and splash like wild bronchus at a water hole . COL. 137 ? NO. 6 The captain enters the picket , solemnly , quietly , frowning . He holds something in his hand that instantly throws a tomblike hush over the two prison wings . The Negro convicts cluster together , paralyzed with fear , drooping their heads , rolling their eyes at the black whip dangling from his right hand . It is a leather strap , two feet long , two and one-half inches wide , three-eighths of an inch thick , fastened to a heavy wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the tip of the strap the leather is worn rough and shredded . The whip is well seasoned . Five guards enter the picket to hold Dirty Yellow clown flat , by his head , arms , and legs . . . . To spare the reader , allow me to skip this picture . Four kinds of penalty are inflicted upon the prison offender , and many of the present convicts have paid the full penalty in each kind . The type called the chains ' is the most brutal of the four , though the convicts unanimously prefer it to the flogging . Physically it is certainly the most harmful . The offender 's wrists are interlocked by one end of a chain , and he is hoisted into the air until his toes barely touch the ground . There he hangs for three , six , sometimes twelve hours . One convict told me that he had hung in the chains from sunrise to sunrise . The chains and the dark cell ? a milder form of punishment ? have both been abandoned recently , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that the convicts prefer to starve and thirst in the clamp cellar rather than work in the cotton-field . The mule ' is a contrivance erected in front of the picket inside the sleeping-hall , and is similar in principle to the wooden horse ' that was popular in Northern Europe during the period of Pietism . It consists of a narrow plank , ? or sometimes of a smooth pole , ? supported at each end by long wooden legs that straddle outward in the manner of the forelegs of a grazing giraffe . For six and often twelve hours the offender rides the ' mule , ' with his arms crossed , facing the picket . The bookkeeper shows me Dirty Yellow 's record card . Its back is covered with nine years ' prison offenses and with their respective penalties . I read at random : 1915 Whipping : 20 lashes for attempting to set fire to the building . 1916 Escaped in cotton-field and caught in the swamps six hours later . 1917 Whipping : 10 lashes for fighting .

Shot down by guard when attempting to escape . 1920 Chains : 6 hours for stealing sugar cane . 1921 Mule : 12 hours for raising disturb- ance . Chains : 6 hours for laziness. 1922 Attempted escape and caught ten minutes later . 192-1 Chopping off one of his own toes with a spade . ' He 's crazy as hell . That 's what 's the matter with Dirty Yellow , ' remarks the bookkeeper . ' A whipping do n't do him much good . Once he grabbed a rattlesnake in the cotton-field and threw it at his guard . He 's crazy , that 's all . He 'll even eat rain-worms when he is hungry . ' Of course he is crazy . ' Most of the time we deserve it , but sometimes we do n't , ' is the answer many of the Negroes give . ' When they whip us , the skin just busts . ' The convicts turn ashen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one of the New England States , serving five years down here for taking a joy ride in an automobile not his own , during a youthful spree , puts it this way : Have you ever been badly sun . burned at the beach ? I mean so ball that you just groan when your shirt touches the skin ? of the whip is something like that : the next is worse ; the third is still worse ; and so on through to the twentieth lick . The skin does n't burst ; it is only torn loose from the flesh , and a mess of blood blisters tear at it for days afterward , especially under the sun in the cotton-field . The captain spreads the licks all over the back from the shoulders to the knee joints . It might be better to get all the licks on one spot , for then the whip would rip up the nerve roots , and then you would n't feel much pain by and hr . ' ' Tell me why they whipped you , Buddy . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young cotton-plant with my hoc in the field ; the weeds were ton near it . And I 'm . not much of a farm hand . I 'm from up North , you know . Never hoed a cotton-field before . ' The bookkeeper shows me the boy 's record card . On the back I read : ' July 3 , 1924 . Whipping : 20lashes for impudence and for destroying Stale property . ' Where sixty years ago the richest slave-plantations spread their cotton verdure along the lowlands of the Gulf , to-day , by fair means or foul , after one generation of almost total decay , seven-then huge penitentiary farms ? and farther north six more ? eke out a precarious existence . Some of the camps are beautified by groves of trees , drooping with luscious figs , others with palm lanes and tulip beds ; but most of them are as barren as the sands of Sahara . The buildings arc old whitewashed wooden structures , erected on cypress poles . Even the captain 's bungalow is leaky and neglected . A muddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one building , five feet above the floor level . Around the Nunlike prison building the guards ' quarters , the small office-building , and the cookhouse form a large semicircular yard . Farther off the barns loom up , with the corrals and dog kennels , the cotton gin , the sorghum mill , and various shacks and shanties . Farthest away , the captain 's residence stands aloof . The Southern simplicity of life prior to the Civil War reigns once more in these remote and almost forgotten lowlands . To-day the swamps are deeper and wider ; the underbrush , the cactus , and the Spanish moss that fringe the swamps are more impenetrable . The alligators , the rattlesnakes , the copperheads , the mosquitoes , and the malaria are more plentiful . The floods , that menace of the free-flowing rivulets of the cleared highlands farther north , are more frequent . Yet the simplicity is here , a benevolent or tyrannical despotism , as the case may be : vast , sunbaked cotton-fields ; the single crop ; free labor ; masters , guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hauled over the bog by oxen , their necks pulling at ropes and rawhide , and , turtle-fashion , their bodies crawling and falling to the darky 's whip and curse . Again over the distant slave-trail the mule teams are pulling wagon trains of men from the last railroad stop ? human beings strung together in grim clusters by a steel chain padlocked to their necks . Ifere the saddle horse is still the standard of speed and convenience . In the swamps the Negro squatter , the Mexican peon , and the half-breed Indian ride their nags and bronchos . Through miles of cotton-fields saddle horses carry the masters , on swift inspection trips  --  strong , proud men , with Mexican hats , square-toed Spanish high boots , with quirt , lasso , cartridge-belt , and six-shooter . And here the guards sit in the saddle the clay long , each hugging a double-barreled shotgun , their eyes sweeping continuously along the hoe-squads that silently , in straight formation , attack the weeds and the boll weevil . Decayed and inaccessible as these parts became after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the damages . Bridges span the smaller rivers that border the present cotton-fields . How else should the bloodhounds and the man-hunters get across and pick up the trail of the fleeing convict ? But on the wilder and more recently redeemed land the rivers are broad and swift . They overflow , with almost mathematical precision , to a height which not infrequently , even miles inland , traps a hundred men and as many floating treasure-chests within the huge sleeping-halls of each camp . There , of course , a bridge is out of the question ; and instead , across the wild , picturesque river , a primitive raft , moored to a cable that spans the stream , floats back and forth , ingeniously pushed across by the flow of the current that strikes the diagonally moored hull . This raft is manned by a trusted lifer ' and by his raccoon and armadillo pets . Through the sweltering days of summer and through the damp Gulf mists of winter , the old lifer has given many a poor soul his last ferry-ride . But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation has been realized . Toward some of the southernmost prison lands ? all of which , during a flood , become the bottom of a vast , turbulent sea that unites with the Gulf of Mexico proper ? a narrow-gauge railroad-spur winds inland over a stretch of swamp that is covered with shoals of dead fish during the dry season . A tiny hand-car ? four wheels , with a plank to straddle , propelled at times by a sputtering engine , at other times by human hand-power , ? connects this rejuvenated social system with the outside world , At the very edge of these fertile swamps oil is oozing out of the mud . Fertile , I say ; for , unbelievable as it may sound , I have seen telephone poles , barkless and stripped of roots and branches , erected through the marshes and cotton-fields to connect two prison farms , sprout and send forth twigs and foliage . To-day the oil industry is closing in on the prison farms . Within earshot of two hundred prisoners in one of the camps a dozen pumps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicts a geyser suddenly gushes forth a stream of fluid gold . Unexpectedly an oil drill may strike a mine of natural gas ; then for weeks a roaring column of smoke three hundred feet high will blow straight toward heaven , spreading a gray cloud-screen , like a sunshade sent by Providence , over the toilers in the cotton-field . Almost overnight a modern oil industry is growing fabulously wealthy in sight of these isolated camps where I have seen a ten-foot alligator crawl out of the sewer creek and snatch a pig for breakfast ? camps so backward that the problem of washing the convicts ' coarse canvas clothing is solved by boiling it over bonfires on the banks of the creek , and beating it with a cudgel on a cypress stump , while water , dirt , and buttons swirl around the laundry trusty . The oil fever has even crept into the prison camps . The cripples found in every camp , ? those men who have survived the buckshot of a guard 's shotgun when they tried to escape , ? these and others incapacitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil , a play as fascinating as poker . And Mother Earth has offered the various prison camps some of her queerest gifts : a luxurious , ever-flowing stream of scalding hot water , and a cool , equally rich stream of genuine sea water , both utilized in the sleeping-hall for the showers and bathing-pool ; drinking-water of various qualities , some saturated with nauseating sulphur salts , some with salubrious iron-rust , some almost hot , some only lukewarm . As yet , no natural ice-water has been found in any of the camps , though I have been told that not many miles away an oil drill recently struck a subterranean spring with water that is too cold , when it reaches the surface , for immediate drinking-purposes . And with all this natural wealth the difficulty of transportation is gradually decreasing . Here and there the automobile finds its way to the prison camp . I have even seen a small mail or passenger car running on rails and driven by steam or gasoline . IV Stimulating and pathetic is the comparison of the slave with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the pigmentation only . The twenty-three camps are not all alike . With over thirty-eight hundred convicts tilling one hundred and forty square miles ? ninety thousand acres ? of land , the various types of men inevitably do differentiate each camp . Generally speaking , the camps are divided into three groups according to the racial majority of their population ? Negroes , Mexicans , and whites . These three groups are segregated , though it is common to find several white convicts in each of the Negro camps , and site versa . There are almost eighteen hundred Negro convicts , four hundred Mexicans , and seventeen hundred whites . And of the whites more than ninety-eight per cent arc native-born : Americans . The Negro is an ideal servant , an ideal slave , an ideal convict . Some of the stronger ones thrive under the rime of whip and bloodhounds . How they fear both ! A short sentence may even fatten them up a bit . When on Sundays one hundred Negroes crouch together on the floor in the sleeping-hall and sing , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus here , ' young boys , white-haired Uncle Toms , and all the grades between , competing with another group of one hundred Negroes in the sleeping-hall across the picket , I actually envy them their present and previous bondage . When in the dusk of dawn or in the hot sun of noon those same darkies run out of the prison yard like a herd of stampeded cattle , straining their legs and arms to the utmost for fear of being trampled down by the galloping guards , the earth shaking , the dust rising in thick clouds , the dogs barking wildly , I often wonder whether even an abolitionist could paint a more vivid picture of the old slave-plantation . But it is during the days of cotton-picking , when the fields , the roads , and the camps are teeming with feverish activity every hour out of the twenty-four , and the Negro convicts , far superior as cotton-pickers to their Mexican and white brothers , are borrowed from camp to camp , that I behold the abolitionists ' real picture of slave life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall he be unto his brethren . ' The darky is , however , also blessed with the innocence of childhood . Seldom does he pule and fret like his chocolate-colored mulatto brethren . Not one half of several hundred heavily sentenced Negroes could tell me when their term expired , and only a few more than half were able to tell me how many years they had been imprisoned . What are a few paltry years more or less to children ? The Mexicans are a sensitive , high-strung group , a seething horde when they are aroused , who stiffer inconceivable tortures in their narrow , unhealthy quarters , used as they are to roaming in the open spaces . Often in the dead of night , and at the slightest provocation , they explode in an outburst of frenzy that grows into violent riot , squelched only by the charge of a six-shooter . Even when they sit gently and peacefully in the sleeping-hall , whittling exquisite crucifixes out of peach stones or crocheting beaded handbags for their sweethearts across the Rio Grande , their nostrils dilate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the watch in the picket . Neither whip nor hounds bend their proud spirit . But years of hard labor in the cotton-field have broken the older men , who sit on the floor among the rest , staring into space , rocking their crumbling bodies . The guards fear the Mexican convicts . The captain more than once , to my knowledge , has risked his life attempting to quell their emotions with the whip . And their ingenuity in making successful escapes will demoralize an entire camp for a week . The emotional outbursts of the Negro and the Mexican camps do not occur on the eight or nine prison farms tilled by whites . Racially these seventeen hundred white convicts form an unusually homogeneous grou p of Anglo-Saxon Americans . Half of them are natives of the State . Eighty-two per cent were born south of Mason and Dixon 's line . Only eleven per cent claim foreign-born parents . Over fifty per cent claim American-born grandparents . They are the sons or grandsons of frontiersmen in a State fertile and vast , still sparsely settled , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live different flags during the century ; and where , in spite of modern cities and rich , scientifically developed natural resources , the horse and the gun to-day are as common as in the early days of Buffalo Bill . But though the whites are less demonstrative than the Negro and the Mexican convicts , a bitter hatred stir-charges their soul . They suffer more from a whipping than their tissue-torn skin indicates ? mental agonies , spiritual losses . And those of the white convicts on the old slave-plantations who survive their prison term reenter society infuriated , and thirsting for revenge . The prison guards are often inferior mentally to the white men whom they drive through the cotton-fields . And though none of these guards to-day are as cruel as Legree in Uncle Tones Cabin they are as inhuman as an average small man can be who is given authoritative power over a group of defenseless human beings in an irritating semitropical climate . His caprice is law . His complaint against a convict means a flogging . It is the guards that the white convict resents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southerner is to be driven to the cotton-fields like the slaves of his forefathers . There is no sadder sight in these United States of America than that of two hundred young white prisoners dragging themselves off to the cotton-field , with armed guards riding at a safe distance behind . It is like coming across one 's own son , helpless and in distress in a strange country , and not being able to aid him . More discrimination is shown in the small camp of the women convicts . There the white inmates , thirty-five in number , are treated as humanely as the women convicts in the more modern prisons of the North ? perhaps more so . During the clay they work in the sewing-rooms , making the canvas clothing that is worn by the male convicts . Only the Negresses march to the fields , hoe on shoulder , a guard behind each squad . Even the flogging has lately been abandoned , though an old captain of one of the Negro camps remarked to me : ' I 've burned the back of many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degenerates . The whip cures that . ' And he quoted the Bible to clinch his dogmatizing . Probably some of them are degenerates ; but is it any wonder ? Sixty-five Negresses of all ages are huddled together in one room in a dilapidated , illsmelling wooden building , with a number of babies crawling and crying on the floor . In this crowded room there is a constant chatter . Often at night there are fights from jealousy , perhaps because two Negresses on their way home from the field both wanted to carry the hoe for a tired mulatto flapper , or because one Negress steals an innocent kiss from the lips of a rival 's girl friend . Not infrequently do they have a fracas in the field , hacking one another with their hoes , and even threatening the guards for interfering in their family affairs . The aildren here are no respecters of persons . The captain 's lovely daughter plays in the prison yard with the Negro babies . They cry when she is called to lunch , and she cries when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurries through her meal to got back to her playmates . V Our abolitionist friends told us years ago that slavery was wrong because the slate , a human being , had been deprived of his free will . Hence , slavery was abolished . Our scientific friends of this mechanistic era tell us that punishment is wrong because the offender never was endowed with a free will , and therefore can not justly be held responsible for his evil doings . Is it possible that our scientists are right , and that these convicts are largely irresponsible ? I am trying in this sketch to be descriptive rather than interpretative . But though I am able to offer some direct testimony , pro and con , on that question , I shrink from being both witness and judge . lost . of the material in my notebook I find unprintable ; and much of it is too poignant for the sensitive reacher . Yet , to convey a picture of the real convict one must get under his skin , since his pigmentation labels him only racially . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's responsibility varies , not only with his own mental and physical strength , but also , to a large extent , with the nature and might of the external forces that are aiding or harming him in his struggle to keep himself alive ? individually and racially . Therefore , as evidence for determining the degree of responsibility of an offender , at least three factors seem to be necessary : the external situation leading up to the offense , the mental status of the offender , and the physical status of the offender . Regarding the convicts here , I should like to present to the reader briefs of these three factors . Their health is probably as accurate a measure of their physical strength as it is possible to convey . According to the unprejudiced testimony of sixty- five prominent medical men of the State who , under the able direction of the past president of the State Medical Association , recently examined 3800 limn and women prisoners in these camps , 891 convicts were found to stiffiT from syphilis , 122 from tuberculosis , 421 from diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease enough to cause blindness unless properly treated , ? 365 from gastrointestinal diseases , 10 from intestinal ulcer , 27 from appendicitis , 1477 from diseases of the nose and throat , and 28417 from diseases and defects of the mouth , teeth , and gums . And these are not all the figures . Such appalling physical weakness could not have originated entirely in the camps , though no doubt it has been aggravated here , perhaps not so much from medical neglect as from the severe toil of the convict in the cotton-field . As yet the prison camp is no health resort , but some attempts , at least , have been made to preserve the convict 's life ? better attempts even than under the old regime , when a slave was worth a little fortune and therefore was given medical aid almost as readily as his master . Many of the prison officials are humane . I have seen a captain with his guards and trusties try to save the life of a dying saddle-horse , and for hours ease its suffering , even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nostrils . And I have seen a dying white convict in a hospital bed receive almost equally good care , though perhaps a little less sympathy . If not infrequently a sun-struck convict be dragged out of the cotton-field dead , it is not due to medical neglect so much as to a weak body , breaking down in a severe environment . For behind every picket a convict doles out medicine to those who are too ill to walk into the cotton-fields . Often a country doctor makes a hasty emergency call at the camps . To-day the statute even provides that a medical man be present during the flogging ? of a convict . Another staff of experts has recently investigated the mental status of 3500 of these same convicts . The psychiatrist reports that five per cent are demented or have deteriorated mentally . Besides these , he found that one fourth of all the convicts examined were so unstable emotionally or so warped in their personality that they had lost the ability to adapt themselves to any socialized system . The psychologists report that ten per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intelligence-level bordering on that of the feebleminded . The psychiatric workers , tabulating the literacy and the industrial efficiency of these convicts , found that twenty per cent of the 3500 convicts were illiterate ; that another twenty per cent had attended school one , two , or three years . Twenty per cent of the whites were unable or barely able to read and write . Double the number of Negroes belong in the same category . Another twenty per cent of the whites have had full or partial high-school training . Almost an equal number of whites ? the identical ones , in fact ? are skilled workers . As a general rule , these convicts endowed with average or higher intelligence are found in the group handicapped on the emotional side . All in all , the mental weakness , as determined by these percentages of demented and psychopathic , deteriorated and feeble-minded convicts , is not equaled anywhere save in our State hospitals . A column of statistics can not reproduce a perspective of human life and its weakness ; still , perhaps these ugly statistical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frail human clay in these prison camps . In presenting the third factor for determining the convict 's responsibility , ? the external situation leading up to his offense , ? my material is of such variety that it hardly lends itself to statistical classification or to a brief that would cover the general cases , and still less to any logical literary form . Suppose , therefore , I submit an abbreviated catalogue of answers from some of the 3500 convicts , of whom I asked the questions , ' What did you do ? ' and ' Why did you do it ? ' Most of the answers may convey to the reader , as they did to the writer , vivid pictures that lend themselves readily to interpretation . The convicts answer the questions frankly . Very few insist that they are innocent , though fewer still admit that they deserve their punishment . Here I find boys who in their early youth were sent to the reformatory for delinquency and later to the county jails for thefts ; who were arrested a dozen times for drinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the peace . Some of them arc even serving their second sentence in the prison . They have wandered about a great deal and have never been regularly employed . They are the type that later , when graduated , join the army of professionals , nine tenths of whom are always at liberty at any one time . The professional criminal , the hero of the younger convict , is perhaps the most interesting individual here . But since his type has been studied extensively by criminologists in Italy , Germany , and England , and since he is in a minority on these prison farms , I shall pass him over briefly . He is generally a strong , mature man , who likes to brag about his outlaw ki I. I held up a gambling-den and raked in the - tikes , and shot a man who looked back too I held up a diner single-handed , and was , aught with the booty soon after I jumped olf the train .

There is another class of professional , greater in number as convicts , but weak and unskilled in their profession , who always regret their crooked deeds as soon as they are caught . I 've served three terms here and fourteen in the county jails . At nine I began in the reformatory . I am now twenty-five , and I have been at liberty only one year . 1 was five times in the pen for stealing . list now I 'm going to quit the game , because I am fifty , and because I have had had luck since 1905 . By far the greatest number of professionals I find among the bootleggers ; and most of these I am loath to call criminals ? shaggy old rent-farmers , caught with a rusty still in the woods , pale bell-hops from the city hotels , and a few prosperous importers . First time I was in trouble I killed a fellow in a fight and got freed , because I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quart of whiskey under my coat ; and I got three years . I sold thirty-five drinks to my friends . And I gets thirty-five years , a year for each drink , because the district attorney promised to free me if I told him the names of all my friends . The majority of the prison population consists of casual or occasional offenders , scores of young lads who tried to forge a small check , clerks who erred , more responsible business men who speculated carelessly , a few bigamists , and a great number of petty thieves . I tried to cash a ten-dollar cheek . I broke into a store and stole myself eight suits of clothes and three pairs of shoes that all fitted me . And I got four years .

My first wife died ; my second wife refused to divorce me ; and my third wife is worth the two years I spend here for bigamy . From the time of Moses the law has fallen heavily upon the sex-offender . I kissed a rich American girl , senor . Fifteen years must I pay for that kiss . A thin , epileptic wreck of a Negro , with three scarlet letters , C ? U ? T , branded deep into his cheeks and forehead , tells me : ' I did n't do it . I did n't do it . ' And he shakes his head wearily . The answers of seven hundred murderers who replied to may questions were almost all answers like that of Snowball : an irritating situation , a fight , a rented gun , a murder .

I fought him with my gun to get back my money . A bad nigger said I owed him two bits , which I did n't . The next morning was Sunday , and I took my shotgun with me to church to defend myself . We had a fight outside the church . During the light , often the wrong person gets killed . And occasionally no fight takes place at all . I was arguing with my wife 's father about a fence , and we began to shoot each other . Then my wife ran between us ; and she ran right into one of the bullets . I shot at my wife 's sweetheart , and a bullet hit my wife 's head because she shielded him . I killed my sister in 1909 by fooling with a gun . I asked the Governor to pardon me when he was here last . ' I 've been here fifteen years , ' I told him . But he answered me like this : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . ' The situation , however , is often griever than that of Snowball . My friend was kissing my wife ; and he says to me : ' Friendship and love are two different things . ' So I shot him . I got 116 years for fighting with my wife , her mother , and my sweetheart . I shot them all three dead . No one can prove that the rented gun , found in the hip pocket of every free man in the State , from the feebleminded Negro drunkard to the senator , is the prime cause of these accidental crimes of anger . Nor is it possible to prove that a Sullivan Law would save one third of the Negroes and not a few of the whites from these prison farms . However , if the convicts are telling the truth , ? and I believe most of them are , for I have checked their answers with the official prison records , ? then the gun , ' rented for ninety-nine years ' from the hardware stores in the State , plays an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a few exceptions , but only a few , where the knife plays the That nigger loved my sweetheart too . We had a little scrimmage . I cut him in the head , once only . And he died in ten minutes . There are other exceptions , a few cases where environmental factors might be excluded as the primary cause . The law of chance would hardly give any man more than one kill in his lifetime , even in a State where guns are as popular as food and clothes . When a convict repeats a murder it may , therefore , not be improper first to look for the primary cause in his mental and physical make-up . I got fifty years for killing a man . I got fifty years more for killing another man . I got five years more for killing a third man . And I got eleven years the fourth time for felonious assault . I got pardoned three times , but not this time , and I did n't even kill him . The premeditated murder , which we arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rare indeed . The offender committing a crime of this type is generally during the act moved by an abnormal emotional tide which for a time floods the avenues of his intellect ; or either his intellect or his emotions may be deteriorated . I could n't get along with my wife , so I decided to kill her . We went into the cotton-field , where I shot her . I went right back and gave myself up . I soaked my husband 's sweetheart in gasoline and stuck fire to her . Among convicts charged with the crime of murder or manslaughter , a few persistently claim that they are innocent . Some of those are hitter ; others pose as martyrs ; some are agitated like trapped animals . They usually shed tears when they tell their story . I knowed nothing about the murder .

If the scientist is correct in his assumption that the great majority of offenders are irresponsible , then punishment is fundamentally wrong . And it is but a matter of time when all the State prisons in the Union will be converted into clinics or clearinghouses for the socially maladjusted individuals . In fact it seems as if this conversion is already on the way . But granting that the scientist offers too scanty proof for his assumption , and the reader accepts the more orthodox view , ' degrees of responsibility , ' even then the punitive methods of our prison farms are doomed . The severest indictment flung at slavery by the imaginative abolitionist declares that it is a sin against God and man , whether it be legalized or not , to deprive a human being of his liberty and utilize him for mercenary purposes as a beast of burden . And no modern State can afford to condone prison conditions which fall under this indictment .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
