O NE cent in every - five that New Yorkers pay to ride in the Interborough Subway goes to pay interest on loans . These loans - were in large part necessitated because the directors deliberately - paid enormous dividends for three years during which they borrowed money for operating expenses , either from banks or from ? a subsidiary company of their own whose stock they - had immorally and perhaps illegally juggled . Another fraction of the fare goes for coal purchased at a higher price than that paid by other transportation companies from.a corporation the head of which is one of the Interborough directors . This sort of frenzied finance has cost the city millions in taxes , the public indecent discomfort , and - the workers a 42,600,000 reduction in wages part of which - was immediately absorbed by bankers in higher interest rates . The directors did not even play fair - with the bankers but broke an agreement with J. P. Morgan &; Co. to keep dividends under 10 per cent as a condition of a loan . In all this they but followed the tradition of deceit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public expense ever since New York first had to deal with the problem of rapid transit . Yet Mr. August Belmont and his fellow-directors are not repentant but defiant . They protest virtue but they will not - waive immunity . If this extraordinary ethical breakdown were characteristic of only one exceptional corporation it would be bad enough , but there is all too much reason to ' believe that a like passion for profit at the expense of workers or consumers or both is in greater or less degree characteristic of the captain of industry  --  who like the directors of the Inter-borough , is often no real captain in a productive army , but only a shrewd juggler of corporation finance . The railway executives make almost as bad ' an ethical showing unless the elaborate charges of that competent statistician , Frank J. Warne , before the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce can be refuted . His evidence , abounding in detailed statistics and illustrated by numerous charts , can not be summarized in brief compass , but his contention can be stated . It is this : Statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their financial plight is due to under-maintenance by the government during the period of Federal control and operation or to the high cost of labor . Their troubles are of their own creation . Mr. Warne points out that : ( 1 ) The roads were not returned by the government in a broken-down condition . On the contrary , they were taken over by - the government at a time when railway executives were themselves deploring the evils of " deferred maintenance , " and they were returned in " effective operating condition . " ( 2 ) Government guaranty of operating expenses effective for - six months after the return of the roads resulted in enormous increases of expenditure which were decreased as soon as the guaranty was ended though - the high wage scale was still in force . ( 3 ) Railway executives can and do inflate their expenses , by the amount spent or charged against maintenance ; by the amount spent on the purchase of supplies ; by the amount spent on damages and claims , and by juggling property investment accounts . Mr. Warne gives concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar year , 1920 , the large sum of more than $122,000,000 was paid by the railroads of the United States in the ad-justment of loss and damages to freight transported by these . carriers . . . Just low far . spurious or false claims of losses and damages paid by the railroad to certain shippers and amounting in effect to rebates enter into - the question is , - of course , not , known . But this avenue of concealing rebates is common knowledge . " During the period of government guaranty , the Pennsylvania Railroad had two hundred of - its locomotives repaired by the Baldwin Locomotive Works at an average cost per locomotive of $23,048 . At-this time the ' cost - in the company 's own shops , which were not crowded to capacity , was $6 ; 636 . Finally , Mr. Warne . claims that " wage increase figures " submitted by the roads are " fallacious or defeetivein eleven important particulars . " Such are the charges against roads of whose reformation we have been so volubly assured . Unless refuted , they are fresh proof that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thieves behind prison bars . Yet they are all honorable men , pillars of churches , trustees ofcolleges and philanthropic institutions . Mike Mr. Belmont - they seek to justify themselves as deserving of praise mot blame . Are we to deal with this ethical problem merely by Rooseveltian denunciation of " malefactors of great wealth , " or does the matter go deeper ? Was the American sociologist , Lester F. Ward , right when he said : " Deception may almost be called the foundation of business " ? Does the regularity with which every great investigation brings to light financial iniquity merely challenge as to more - investigation and - more thorough regulation , or does it suggest a moral rottenness in a system whose god is gain not service and whose primary motive is profit not the joy of creation ? Publicity and the Conference T was the English ' liaison-officer " between the press and 1 the British delegation to the Washington Conference who last week urged his regular morning group of press visitors to have their photographs taken as a body . " The future historian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the faces of the men who daily reported the happenings at this Conference to four hundred millions of readers . " The figure is appalling and becomes none the less so if one considers the mass of misrepresentation and contradiction , of guesswork and supposition , of officially inspired and personally invented opinions , in which are daily buried certain nuggets of news . Were one to be guided wholly by it one would alternate between hope and despair , between prospects of the millennium and the blackness of irreparable world disaster . Were anyone to endeavor for a single week to reconcile the daily reports which fill three and four pages of our metropolitan dailies , he must inevitably wind up in a madhouse . Plainly too much is being given to the readers who must be longing for some simple authoritative column-long story setting forth in brief the actual day by day progress , if any . There is actual danger , as we write , of public interest in the Conference being - weakened or killed by over-publicity . Moreover , when one considers the army of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conference , one wonders what has become of the journalistic unions of whose organizations we used to hear . It ' is true that these - romancers , novelists male and female , poets , ex-diplomats , ex-statesmen , college professors , etc ? who are earning fabulous sums in telling how the Conference strikes them , can not be exactly classified as " scabs . " But they have no union cards and they are so clearly degrading the journalistic profession by trying to prove that anybody can be a world-conference correspondent , if they are not actually taking the bread out of the mouths of hardworking professionals with babies to feed , that we had looked ere this for the threat of a strike , or at least a mass-meeting of protest on the White House ellipse . Some of them , like Mr. Bryan , have violated all the ethics of journalism by rising in their seats and emitting whoops of joy . The diplomats , except Mr. Hughes , have run true to form . Why not the jour-nalists ? Seriously , overdone as has been the daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch , Japanese , and Belgian opinion of the progress of the game , this very publicity seems to us the true safeguard of the Conference . At Paris there was a censorship  --  although the French denied it . Here there is not even a reading of the dispatches by government officials . That in itself is a gain , and the result of it all is that we can not at this writing see how any single delegation could possibly afford to walk out of the Conference , except perhaps the embattled Chinese who do not know whom to trust unless it be ourselves . Despite , the daily ups and downs of optimism and pessimism , despite the slowness of it all and the circumlocutions of the diplomats and their experts , despite all the talking behind closed doors in committee-rooms , the Conference is meeting in the fiercest glare of publicity that ever beat upon any similar gathering . Not all of the four hundred millions are reading much of what is going on ; the superfluity of news here in New York is greatly increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which so many of our " best citizens " belong . But the delegates are aware , if we judge aright , that far more people are reading intelligently than ever followed such a conference before  --  probably ten thousand times more than tried to follow the proceedings of the Congress of Vienna . Therein lies hope . So great do we believe to be the educational results to follow from this wide reading that we shall not despair even if the Conference should break up without any agreement . We would not be foolishly optimistic , nor are we blind to the fact that up to this writing no attention whatever has been given to the outlawing of war , nor even to the outlawing of the worst instruments of war ; that those who say this is merely a conference to reduce the cost of war have much on their side . But what organization or organizations could have purchased such publicity for moves toward disarmament ? What government could readily or easily pay the millions upon millions necessary were a similar educational experiment to be undertaken by paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress is flooded with letters demanding real disarmament . The revolt of the Japanese journalists was in itself the result of publicity , or , perhaps better , the fear of adverse publicity . At Portsmouth the Japanese delegation would see no reporters and give no news ; this time they vie with the Occidentals in seeking to aid the press . Already public opinion has forced a consideration of Shantung which was upon no official agenda . True , this consideration is outside of the Conference . But . the result is to be reported to it and the discussion : is an important by-product . Finally , the truer picture the American press and public have gained of the French dog-in-themanger policy may yet prove to be worth the cost of the whole undertaking . The Isle of Actuaries O NE of the most singular excursions we ever made was to the Isle of Actuaries , which lies , so far as we can remember , somewhere off the coast of Probability very near Insurance Headland . News of the island had come to us with a pleased surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion that his profession after all may not be very sympathetic or imaginative . In that island , he informed us , are gathered all the persons who have paid insurance premiums up to the age of ninety-five , after which they are excused from further payments by their companies and receive the total sum of their insurance quite as if they had earned it by dying . But this easy money , instead of going to their beneficiaries , goes to the insured themselves , who henceforth sit back and comfortably watch the world go by without a pang or a responsibility . The actuaries who deserve the credit for this benevolent provision have done more than to prove that the insurance companies do not need the premiums of persons past ninety-five : they have established a cheerful haven for them on a green island in a warm gulf and have invited them to spend their money there . We must not deny that there are some controversies to mar the exquisite serenity we had expected to find on the island . For instance , one polemic nonogenarian whispered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and he did n't greatly care if it did come . " Why , these actuaries , " he hissed , " are n't benefactors . They 're only lazy . I know why they cut us off the list when we got to be ninety-five . They did n't want to carry us on their mortality tables any more . They were afraid we 'd throw their calculations out of joint . They got tired of figuring . So they said we might as well be dead and counted us dead . What 's the compliment in that , I 'd like to know ! " And a recalcitrant companion joined him ih his hissing . " Any way , who gets our money ? Here the companies coax us to this island and then let us pay board . They have the only stores in the whole place . Of course all the money goes back to where it came from . And our poor beneficiaries ? " But we saw only a little of this repining spirit . For the most . part the nonogenarians assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ever met . Consider their condition and their occasions for rejoicing . Whenever one of them comes to the day of the year on which his premium used to fall due he snaps his finger at the whole world ; consequently the island resounds night and day with the jocund din of celebrations . While we were there some of the inhabitants were burning insurance collectors in effigy ; some were spending the day in laughter at , the joke on their heirs who had expected something very different ; some were writing recipes for longevity to send to their younger friends who hoped some day to reach the island ; some merely sat in the cool shade and piped and sang for joy . " What I like about it , " said one of them , " is that this island proves you can get almost anything if you work and wait long enough for it . " " It proves , " said another , " that sometimes a man single-handed can beat the game . " And another : " It proves that it is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
