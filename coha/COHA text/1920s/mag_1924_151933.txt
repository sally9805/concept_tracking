Perhaps never before in our history have business men given such close attention to the price indices for commodities . For this situation the fear of-or sometimes the hope of- " gold inflation " is responsible . The Bradstreet indices for July 1 showed a smart upward trend , which the weekly index numbers of Prof. Irving Fisher ( Yale economist ) have corroborated . The publication of the wholesale price indices for commodities by the U.S. Department of Labor-considered by many the most scientific price index available-now reaffirms the upward price tendency . <P> For July , the Labor Department 's index , covering 404 commodities , registered 147.0 , compared with 144.6 for the preceding June , and 150.6 for July , 1923 . Last month 's was the first upward tendency shown since February , 1924 . Of its nine principal commodity group indices , four declined , one remained unchanged , and four rose . Fuel and lighting fell from 175 last June to 173 last July , metals from 132 to 130 , building materials from 173 to 169 , and house furnishings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 127 . But farm products shot up from 134 to 141 , food from 136 to 138 , cloths and clothing from 187 to 188 , and miscellaneous commodities from 111 to 112 . As between the same months , of the 404 total commodities covered , 173 showed no change in price , 106 showed increases , and 125 showed decreases . It is apparent that as yet , the evidence of coming " gold inflation " is inconclusive . One indication of the possible breadth and scope of this coming tendency is the number of prominent American bankers , business men and government officials who have this summer gone abroad to " study conditions . " It is generally agreed that the opportunities for profit are large . European manufacturing plants , especially in Germany , are reported in good shape . Labor is highly trained , abundant and heartily sick of Bolshevism , provided that employment at fair rates can be obtained . Most practical business men are fully aware of the fact that when industry is sound and lacks only capital to prosper , the investor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and does so most quickly . What has been true of American corporate reorganizations , it is felt , will also be found true of similar reorganizations of the basic and established European industries , with this country filling the role of financier .
