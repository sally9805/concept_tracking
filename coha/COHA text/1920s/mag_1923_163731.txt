Sir Henry Maybury , considered the greatest expert on roads in the world , gave a few interesting side-lights on that yellow-back , thick , choking , aeriform known prosaically as " London fog " : <P> " In the non-foggy month of June , 54 tons of dirt were deposited from the air on a square mile in the City of London . <P> " During the past three years there had been 27 days of ground fog ; the number of buses unable to complete their scheduled journeys , 10,202 ; mileage lost , 434,457 . <P> " In February , 1921 , a dense fog , starting at 6 p. m. , caused 1,436 buses to lose 33,266 miles , while 189 were taken off with a loss of 39,000 miles . " <P> Nothing was said about the remaining traffic which is obliged to travel at a snail 's pace , owing to the impenetrable density of the fog . <P> The fog is a soot-laden white mist of great weight . Owing to the warmth of the ground and the consequent lighter pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , when there is no wind to blow it away-and covers the earth until the heat gradually dissipates it . Were it not for the soot , the mist would probably be dissipated by the surface heat as it descended .
