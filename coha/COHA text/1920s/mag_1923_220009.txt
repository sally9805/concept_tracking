The steady decline of the deathrate from typhoid fever in the United States for the last twelve years still continues . In 1922 a new low record was reached in the large cities of the country , which averaged 3.15 deaths from this disease per 100,000 population-less than one-sixth the rate ( 19.59 ) for 1910 . Three cities with an aggregate population of 473,975 were without a single death from typhoid in 1922 . The two great sources of typhoid infection-polluted water and raw milk-have been practically eliminated by chlorination and pasteurization in cities over 100,000 . Typhoid is no longer an urban dis- ease , and chief efforts for its prevention are now being directed to rural sanitation , picnic grounds , etc . A picture of the physician to the Emperor of Japan appeared on the Medical Page of TIME last week . Through an error , the name of Dr. Yoshihiro Takagi was given instead of that of Dr. Kinnosuke Muira.
