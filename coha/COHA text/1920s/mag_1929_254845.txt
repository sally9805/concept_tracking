Many a U. S. woman has starved to preserve a slim figure , some men have refrained from reaching for a sweet . Nonetheless , the world 's sugar crop has become yearly greater . Largely and suddenly expanded after the War , production increased by leaps and bounds until prices clumped , profits dwindled . <P> Therefore , on May 3 , 1926 , President Gerardo Machado y Morales of Cuba announced a new and corrective policy . Cuba , largest ( 22% of total ) world producer , would limit its planting . Thus , argued Cubans , would supply be brought down to demand . Thus would prices mount , profits increase . <P> But the Cuban restriction plan , like England 's rubber restriction experiment , achieved quite opposite results . The rest of the sugar producing world saw a golden opportunity to make money . And while Cuban production fell from 5,125,970 tons in 1925 to 4,011,717 tons in 1928 , the world crop , swelled by many a new cane and beet plantation , rose from 23,687,000 to 25,326,000 . Cuba then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously unsettled . <P> No one was surprised , therefore , when the great restriction plan last December came to an abrupt and official end . Only the Sugar Export Co. remained as a potential marketing machine for use in future emergencies . <P> Last week , in Havana , Chairman Earl D. Babst of American Sugar Refining Co. called importantly at the presidential palace of Gen. Machado . His remarks were terse and to the point . Now that the experiment had failed , he declared , let there be no thought of repeating it . And let all traces of the disaster be expunged .

Last year 's profit from all sources ( including income from the - owned National Sugar Refining Co. ) totaled $9,614,432 , as against $6,618,740 in 1927 . Its holdings are wide and diverse . Not only does it own sugar refining plants but also a cooperage company , a coal company , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a railroad . This property produces 12% of all the company 's raw sugar requirements . <P> Tall , fair-skinned , Earl D. Babst is the 59-year-old chairman of A. S. R. A. , director of Great American Insurance Co. , American Alliance Insurance Co. , Massachusetts Fire &; Marine Insurance Co. , North Carolina Home Insurance Co. , American National Fire Insurance Co. , Great American Indemnity Co. , Mt .
