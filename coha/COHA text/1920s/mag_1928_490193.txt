WAR gas to keep people from speakeasies would hardly be effective . We arc glad that the Government is alert to the problem , and we are glad that there are always people at work perfecting deadly gases , because it shows progress . But anyone who has ever been in a speakeasy , and dwelt for an evening in its velvet atmosphere , knows that a new and hardy race of people is springing up a vital people who subsist even under dark and primitive conditions , a people who drink strong , bad gin mixtures and breathe the heavy smoke of unventilated cellars , true to America through thick and thin . It is this persistent and vigorous stock which the authorities must reckon with . War gas sprinkled about by the Government would never be noticed . IF you walk Fifth Avenue ! much you may have noticed the little hall of fame created by Pirie MacDonald , who takes photographs of big men by accenting cheekbones and wrinkled brows and subduing warts . Nine of America 's giants are on display in his window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined the list , hoping to find therein some index to greatness . After each man 's name is a word or two to explain what line he 's in . We report that America 's lucky leaders are as follows : John J. Raskob , General Motors ; David Sarnoff , Radio Corporation ; W S. Gifford , Telephone and Telegraph ; F. G. Shattuck , Schraffts ; Darwin P. Kingsley , N. Y. Life ; Fred F. French , Fred F. French ; Charles Schwab , steel ; C. E. Mitchell , National City Bank ; Bishop Manning ( no line indicated ) . There is also a little sign announcing that the studio is closed till September 17 . The camera , we assume , went all to pieces under the strain . ONE of the greatest personal sacrifices of all times , as we look at it , was the sacrifice Miss Earhart made in endorsing a brand of cigarettes so she could earn fifteen hundred dollars to contribute to Commander Byrd 's South Pole flight . She admitted in her letter that she " made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it seemed to him " an act of astonishing generosity . " Pioneering must go on , whatever the toll ; the waste places must be conquered . Since , however , the faculty of Reed University , in Oregon , declares that it is impossible for a person blindfolded to tell one cigarette from another , it seems to us that the only honorable course left for Commander Byrd , in order to vindicate science and validate Miss Ear-hart 's gift , is to fly to the South Pole blindfolded . MO date New York has shown nothing but progress . Hopefully we await the first signs of decadence  --  partial decadence being the only condition under which anybody can exist with any degree of grace and civility . In a wholly progressive city noontime is the most discouraging time of day  --  the 1100115 roar and blaze , an orgy of soda water , sandwich counters , heat , traffic , heavy hotel table d'Utes , blue plate specials , and luncheon club speakers . There are few places you can go where the atmosphere is anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the day , prosperity mounting over a clank of coffee cups . We would like to advocate a midday caesura of at least two hours , during which time a citizen could get hold of himself . In order to effect such a plan , it will probably be necessary to turn Bryant Park into a garden cafe , entirely surrounded by horse-chestnut trees , with gravel under foot and red wine under consideration , where shiftless waiters will pay very little attention to you , and where you can just sit . Mr. Hoover 's Recreation WE learn from a Washington mart who has seen a lot of Hoover that every night before he goes to sleep he reads from two books which he takes to his bedside before retiring . One of these is something very technical , about engineering as a rule  --  something like his own translation of " Agricola De Re Metallica . " The other  --  why , the other is a detective story . Hoover is true to form in this respect . He reads the technical work first and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such other holidays as he found time for , it has been Mr. Hoover 's habit to take walks along the banks of some small stream or other in Virginia . On these occasions he followed up the stream until his expert eye discovered a suitable site for a darn . Then , with great care , he would lay out his plans for damming the waterway . These completed , off would come his coat and he would proceed to their execution . Sometimes the construction work took only an hour or two , sometimes all day . Diligently he would lug boulders , stones , lumps of sod , and logs , and standing knee-deep , build his dam . When completed it would pass inspection by the War Department or the Engineers ' Club . Not always did he work alone on these projects . Sometimes one or more of his secretaries would he pressed into service as assistant engineers or , more exactly , laborers . The work was always done in an atmosphere of intense earnestness . When the dam was finished and perfected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in taking liberties with other people 's property . Another point we were told about Hoover is that he is probably the only American citizen who kept a president waiting in his ante-room . It was during the war , just after he had been named Food Administrator . He was hurriedly assembling a staff and there was much bustle about . Inexperienced persons were being put in all sorts of jobs . One such was guardian of the door to his inner office . On one of his morning walks President Wilson strolled into the place and asked to see the Food Administrator . The young doorkeeper , woefully ignorant of Washington etiquette , and not having much practical judgment anyhow apparently , said that Mr. Hoover was engaged and invited the President to wait . The latter did . He picked up a paper and occupied a chair for twenty minutes , until a secret service man , who had been wondering what had become of him , entered and , realizing the situation , strode indignantly to the door of Mr. Hoover 's office , threw it open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portent ANOTHER anecdote about a col-one Felicia , a laundress , failed to show op one day at the apartment of a lady who , as a result , was considerably put out . Later she chided the servant for not advising her in advance when she was prevented from coming . " A friend ob mine died dat day ! " exclaimed the maid . , ...... itAsi Her mistress replied that she could scarce- ly have known about that . This surprised thee col ored girl . " But , " she said , " loan you ' member how it thundered an ' lightened dat day ? Could n't you tell by dat , somebuddy had died ? " Dog Racing THE greyhound racing at Dongan Hills , Staten Island , is a replica in miniature of horse racing . There is a quarter-mile track , a grandstand , a judge 's stand , and a paddock . The principal point of contrast with horse racing is that the greyhounds run after dark . This makes a pleasing picture . The brightly lighted track stands out strikingly against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the horizon , and , on the night we attended , the new moon came up at an appropriate moment . The greyhounds are beautiful beasts and are , we were told , quite valuable . They are always restless apparently , nervously eager . In the paddock their straight legs are taut , their look expectant . In the race they bound along with a graceful wave-like motion at a speed approximating that of horses . They do a quarter of a mile in twenty-eight seconds , inure or less . Although they arc started from individual pens , the doors of which arc jerked up simultaneously at the judge 's signal , they run in a pack and not in lanes , as do whippets . Their inspiration in the race is an electric rabbit , a bobbing toy suspended from an overhanging track . It is controlled by an operator seated atop the grandstand . When the entrants are lined up this fellow sets his rabbit in motion in time to have it going full tilt as it passes the starting line . The dogs are liberated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbit just ahead of the leading dog all around the course . We were told that the mechanical rabbit is scented to smell Like real one . A band plays lively airs between races , and each event is preceded by a parade of hounds led by attendants in a livery worthy of Ziegfeld . This may be significant , for the owner of several of the greyhounds entered is Miss Billie Burke . Another owner is Mr. jack Heeney , one-time middleweight champion of New Zealand and brother of Tom , who fought Tunney . The management hopes that the races will catch on socially , but the bloods and belles of Long Island were not there the night we were . It 's a long way to Dona-an Hills , of course , and there is some talk , they say , of taking the races to Long Island if Long Island wo n't go to Staten Island . There is a pretence of discouraging betting , and the management asks patrons to help suppress it , but there is some kind of hocus-pocus over pictures of the dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawked by men in uniform for various amounts up to five dollars . We gathered that if you bought the picture of a dog that finished first , second , or third , you could cash it in for more than you paid for it . Hotel Lace DIFFERENT people are affected differently by United States customs inspectors . Our hero for this week is the homecoming traveller on Pier 59 who brought in a quantity of fine lace in a trunk . The inspector was terribly indignant . " What 's this ? " he demanded . - " Lace , " said our hero . " My wife and t always take lace with us from home when we travel . We ca n't stand hotel lace . " Northern AGENTLEMAN who used to live in San Francisco told us the other day about 11 . A. Snow , the big-game hunter , whose movie , " Lost in the Arctic , " is at the Gaiety . Mr. Snow 's first camera trip into the lonely-North was in quite elegant style . Some loyal son of the Golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not what they ought to be a new navigation company had been formed , and the entire San Francisco Chamber of Commerce had been invited to make the first trip on the S. S. Buford , and bring along the wife . The ship was dressed in flags , Captain Louis Lane ( the same who later skippered the schooner in the film ) was signed as master , the six Brown Brothers with their famous saxophones were pressed into service against long Arctic evenings , and Mr. Snow and his son Sidney joined the party to film bears and walrus . The ship coasted quietly along week after week , and the members of the Chamber discovered that trade relations consisted mostly of certain negotiations which their wives carried on with friendly Eskimos who came alongside in kayaks and traded ivory cigarette holders for United States silver dollars , the balance of trade being always in favor of the Eskimos . Mr. Snow desultorily took pictures of seals and birds , and the six Brown Brothers continued to play dance music through blue lips . By the time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice pack , the ladies were tired ofthe whale business and wanted to go home . Meantime walrus had been sighted and Mr. Snow wanted to take pictures of them . Captain Lane aimed to please everybody , but that was impossible . He would catch glimpses of walrus off the port bow and then of terribly bored ladies on the main deck aft and not know which way to steer . Mr. Snow did get several thousand feet of film , some of which is used in the present picture , but he did n't get enough for a feature film and he decided he would go back again later when the Arctic was n't so crowded with ladies . This trip was made in a three-masted schooner commanded by Capt . Lane . Minus the Chamber of Commerce , he succeeded in taking his pictures and in reaching Herald Island to find the bones of Stefansson 's lost men . ? HOT WEATHER HINT : A clerk in one of the Schulte cigar stores ( who of course works behind a counter ) wears a light alpaca coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gets about golf E in the East has played over one or more of the links designed by Charles Blair Macdonald . A golf notable one hears little of , he lives at the Plaza and just now is spending his spare time writing a book of recollections about the game . Away back in the seventies , Macdonald attended the University of St. Andrews in Scotland . Mostly he studied golf , on the historic links of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club where he had the elder Torn Morris as instructor , and Young Tom Morris , sometimes called the greatest golfer of all time , as fellow-player . At the end of his schooling he returned to this country , and then for nearly twenty years he saw golf through what he calls the " dark ages . " By that he means " Fake , ai n't if ? " the time before the game was taken up generally here . On the Chicago lakefront he made one desperate and disastrous effort to introduce the game . Tomato cans sunk in the ground served for holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not until the World 's Fair that he laid out a successful course in Chicago . Shortly after that he helped found the United States Golf Association . He won the first amateur championship held under its auspices . In 1907 Macdonald , then a stock broker in New York , conceived the idea of reproducing in a classic American course the best eighteen holes to he found in Great Britain . It was a colossal job . He spent months abroad measuring and mapping the best holes . He returned here and got seventy of his golfing friends to finance the project . This resulted in the National Links at Southampton . As it turned out , half of the course was copied from historic holes abroad and half created nut of Macdonald 's own fancy . He thus became the pioneer golf-course architect in this country . With him it has always remained an art , since he has never taken a penny from the game  --  his career is still on the Stock Exchange . Through men he trained and others who have followed his lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He created the famous Lido links by pumping ocean sand into the marshes of Long Beach . Other notable courses he has designed are those of Yale , Deepdale , Piping Rock , the Mid-Ocean at Bermuda , and the famous private course of T. Suffern Taller , Ocean Links , at Newport . He spends his summer weekends within a mashie stroke of the National Course and his winters in Bermuda , by the side of the Mid-Ocean Links . Ex planation A S the Twentieth Century pulled out for Chicago the other day it had among others a Pullman car rejoicing in the name of Tulpehocken . An exasperated matron , whose nursemaid was unable to fend off the excited inquiries which the lady 's several small children kept making , turned finally upon them and said , " It does n't mean anything . It 's just the Pullman Company trying to be silly . " Tabac II such matters interest you , the people at the cigar store at No. 4 on the Battery claim it to be the oldest in the city . They say this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass away , however , for the four-story brick building of which the shop occupies the ground floor is soon to be torn down , The evolution in ownership of the little store may he interesting . It was founded about eighty years ago by an Irish tobacconist named Foley , a person of some political importance in his day . Minor party leaders used to forgather there when pipe-smoking was the rule . Later a German named Schrier took over the business and held on for thirty years , to give up finally in disgust because new-fangled cigarettes hurt his trade in the cigars , which he made himself in a back room . Two Syrians bought the place next  --  just hack of it lies the Syrian quarter  --  hut they did n't make a go of it and relinquished the shop to two brothers by the name of Brown , who conducted the cigar store successfully for ten years . Five years ago it passed into the hands of its present owners , the Messrs . Friedman and Goldberg . THE NEW YORKER Angles of the Alley AN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tin Pan Alley tells us that the gentlemen who make , or at least eke out , a living writing our more or less popular tunes number in all about a thousand . There arc not many more than a score of men who have made actual fortunes out of a song or a group of songs . For the rest it is a struggle and a scramble to make both ends meet . For one thing , if they have composed something promising , they have to pay any number of " angles . " An angle is a person who agrees to help make the song popular by " plugging " it . Just now the biggest angle of all is the radio singer , o : ? at /east such radio singers as engage in this sort of thing . They sometimes ask , and get , thirty to fifty per cent of the royalties of a song for singing it consistently in their broadcasting hours . Some of them go even further and demand additional money from the music publishers themselves . Other angles to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie-house program directors , and the like . In the long run this exploitation frequently increases the sale of a song mightily  --  and takes a mighty share of the profits from the increase . In the old days the popular vaudeville singer used to be the greatest exploiter of songs . Publishers themselves were the ones that paid them , and the compensation was often as high as two hundred dollars a week for including a song in an act . It got so that on one occasion some years ago four acts on a Keith Palace bill were " featuring " the same ballad . This was a song that a certain plunging publisher was spending a lot of money on . Some vaudeville acts , as a result , often used songs merely because they were paid to sing them and neglected songs they might better have used . Among those who complained about that were the local theatre managers . Then the music publishers got together and formed the Music Publishers Protective Association and resolved that they would not pay acts to sing songs . Hence it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , have an easy time of it . Jazz bands , singers , and such are only too glad to pay for , rather than be paid for , presenting their songs . Furthermore , the publishers always exert every effort to popularize the work of the famous writers . Even years ago , for example , an Irving Berlin song was plugged more consistently than the work of any other composer published by that house . Still it is interesting to learn that the two biggest song hits in the history of the Berlin corporation were not written by Mr. Berlin . These songs were " M-A-MM-Y " and " Tuck Me to Sleep in My Old ' Tacky Home . " Berlin 's own " Always " ranks close to them and , next in order , his " Remember " and " What 'll I Do ? " Incidentally , there are very few successful women song-writers , but one lady , Miss Mabel Wayne , is co-author of the sentimental waltz , " Ramona , " which seems to be the biggest-selling song just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a hundred thousand dollars in royalties . She also wrote " In a Little Spanish Town , " which was a money-maker . The name Mary Earl , often seen on sheet music , is a copyrighted pseudonym belonging to a firm of music publishers and is used on songs written by men .
