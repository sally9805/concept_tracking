FOR several years after my arrival in Tropical Africa , while living in the midst of natives , and fully conversant , as I imagined , with their customs and their way of thinking , my heart was filled with compassion for the hardworking and submissive black woman . What a field ! ' I often said to myself , ' for the vindicators of women 's rights ! Oh ! if I could only bring here one of those energetic lady champions ! What a storm she would raise in the whole world , until she had set rolling the stone which would , in the end , bring if not entire freedom , at least relief to these poor and patient creatures ! ' Pending the arrival of a militant ally , I tried my best , wherever I happened to be , to pave the way by word of mouth for a more energetic propaganda in the future ; but I must confess , to my shame , that my efforts met with very little success . It is perhaps just as well , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to date , as far as I am aware , failed to materialize . When I tried to explain to a husband that it can not , in fairness , be expected from the mother of a family to collect firewood in the forest , to bring water from the river , and to carry all the household goods on a journey , I was invariably met by that vacant stare which natives who can not , or will not , understand know so well how to assume ; and as to the women themselves , my discomfiture amounted to a fiasco ! They had too attitudes in response to my veiled in citements to rebellion : the one war that of benevolent toleration , if not exactly approval , of my intentions rather than my words , the humoring , so to speak , of the harmless hobby of a good-natured eccentric ; the other , more humiliating still , was that of boundless merriment , finding expres. sion in peal after peal of laughter , to which the listeners gave way , and which kept on reaching me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they moved away from my camp The native point of view is well illustrated by the following cornersa - tion which I once had with a Yao , a tribe in which every man is a born sea-lawyer . ' As he was leaving his hut , and had already gone a little dis . tance , he called back to his wife to bring him his tobacco . I said : ' Your wife has a lot of stool to do : she cooks your food , she looks after the child , she pounds the grain , she brings firewood and water ? can you not go and fetch your tobacco yourself ? ' Have I not , ' he answered , ' given her everything she possesses , claim , and beads , and money to pay the hub tax ; and do 1 not give her money to buy food ? ' I see , ' I replied : ' you look viol your wife as your servant , and what you give her is her salary . ' But , ' said he , ' is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ? Does not a white man get a wife because he wants her to look after his house and his food ? When he wants a new kind of pudding , he tells her , and she looks into her book , where everything about puddings is written , and then she calls the cook and tells him what to do . Is not that the same as with us ? ' There certainly was a time when terrible acts of cruelty were perpe ! trated against women in Tropical Africa ; but these acts were not so much the consequence of the women 's enslaved state , as of the omnipotence of the chiefs , who , when they chose , treated their male subjects as bar ; barously as the female ones . From the moment when British supremacy made it impossible for native poten-t tates to indulge in the satisfaction of barbarous caprices , there was nothbig to prevent the existence of native hwomen from running its peaceful course along lines made immutable ; by a practice which has lasted many centuries . Undoubtedly , the relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not on an idea of inferiority of / the one sex to the other , but on division of labor . If , in some tribes , like , for instance , the Wayao , the woman i throws in , by sway of pourboire , an outward shore of extreme humility and submission , she does so , as I will show I later , on an entirely noncommittal understanding , merely , I am afraid , because the cunning creature is well aware of the weak spot in the cuirass of the lord of creation . When , in the last-named tribe 's country , I saw a woman kneel in the r ust when addressing her husband or handing him anything , I could not repress a feeling of indignation with , ' re male , for what I considered to be the outcome of insufferable arrogance on his part ; nor would I believe him when he replied to my outspoken comments with the words : ' Have I told her to kneel down ? She is following her own heart . ' I subsequently found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In most of the Nyasaland tribes , permanent connubial life is preceded by a term of probation , which can be broken off at will by either party . When the woman has finally made up her mind to stay , sire punctuates her decision by kneeling when she addresses her husband . As a rule , she will inaugurate this change in their relations by a little coup de thOcitre . She will choose an occasion when chance has brought together a goodly number of people , and she sees her husband standing among them . She will then walk right up to him , kneel down before him , put some trivial question , or give some unimportant piece of information , wait for the reply in a kneeling posture , and , after this has been given , get up and join the others . By thus humbling herself , she has taken possession of her husband . In some tribes , as , for instance , that of the Wangoni , where probation is not required , the girls will postpone kneeling until after marriage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand them anything , are the women of the Nyasa Basin expected to kneel , but also when they minister to their wants , or even when they nurse them during an illness . A common sight is a ' beau 's ' morning ' toilette ' at the hands of his wives . He sits cross-legged in front of a large cooking-pot filled with water , ? a device for a looking-glass , and his wives , supposing there are two of them , kneel , one on each side of him , one of them holding a small bottle of oil and a long-toothed wooden comb , and the other a knife or scissors and sometimes a fiat- 188 FEMINISM IN NYASALAND iron to flatten the recalcitrant curls , as it is every black man 's endeavor to have as little kink in his chevelure as possible . The Wayao , descendants of conquerors , very intelligent , and very conceited , set the fashion in British Central Africa . The neighboring tribes are gradually adopting their customs and habits , and even their tribal marks . Something similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was prevalent in Europe among the better classes in all countries . It would be a mistake to infer , from the ostentation of wifely devotion just mentioned , a particularly humble or timorous disposition on the part of the performers . The whole show is a mere conventional formality , like our surrendering of a seat in a car to a lady , or giving her precedence . Barring a few concessions to traditional custom , native women in British Central Africa enjoy to-day a liberty greater than that of most European married women . Were it not that polyandry is unknown , one might almost be tempted to compare their emancipated status with that of the women of Tibet . Marriages between natives are essentially maniages de eaneenance , and sentiment rarely plays a part in them . But it is an ill wind that blows no one any good , and the great advantage connected with this materialistic attitude lies in the fact that enforced celibacy is practically nonexistent among natives . Even lepers in the early period of the disease find a mate ; it happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afflicted with that illness , marry persons who enjoy perfect health . No man or woman is too deformed to marry . Not long ago I saw a woman , a poor little hunchback dwarf . ' Poor creature ! ' I exclaimed ; ' she will never find a husband ! ' ' She has been married for years , ' wa the reply . A couple of years ago , a young Ngon came to me for medicine for a festerim sore on the instep of one of his feet . asked him how he had come by it , am was informed that it was a bite , in. flitted by his first wife in a fit of jeal ousy , because he had taken a second one . After this act of revenge , she had run away with an Askari . I could not refrain from expressing my pity for the poor woman , who had obviously been very fond of her husband . But Joseph ? such was that young bigamist 's name ? could not be made to accept my point of view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strong , and he wore war-medals besides , hay . ing been through the campaign in German East . I met him again about a year later , and asked him how he was getting on , and if he was still happy with his second wife . She has left me , ' he said ; she has gone to live with James . ' James ? ' I exclaimed , ' the man in the workshop ? ' The same , ' he said . Now this James is a hopeless cripple , who moves about with extraordinary nimbleness on his hands and knees Like so many native cripples , he is a mechanical genius , and he was , at the time I am writing about , employed in the workshop on the estate of a Euro . pean . ' You do not mean to say , ' I said to Joseph , ' that your wife has de . sorted you , a strong , big man , to go and live with that cripple ? ' James has got plenty money , ' was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nowadays , among the Wayne ) , the Wanyanja , and the tribes which have adopted their customs , girls are no more bought from the father with cattle or goats , and no girl is given 10 marriage against her consent . This is the case also among the tribes of the r Livingstone Range . Chief importance is given to the expenses incurred by the husband on account of the woman , in establishing her household . These are Iconsidered as imposing upon the latter a moral liability . A Yao once asked me if Europeans make presents to the father of their fiancee . When I told him that it is the other way , and that the father gives the daughter money for her married I establishment , and that her friends give her presents , he inquired : ' Is this because the parents of the girl are afraid , that , perhaps , when the if two they have give been her nothing , l for sonic years , and a quarrel arises , the husband might say to his wife : " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I married you , you had nothing , and I gave you everything ! " ? ' It is strange how the ideas concerning the conduct which is expected from unmarried girls vary in different tribes . Among the Wayao , and those who have come under their influence , girls are allowed to grow up without supervision or restraint . How great is the influence , for good or evil , of the Wayao over their neighbors , may be concluded front the fact that this laxity of morals has spread even to the Wangoni , al-1 though their parent nation , the Zulu i of South Africa , punishes girls who have disgraced themselves , by death through warrior ants . TheWataaveta of the Kenia Province allow their young a licence as great as that of the Wayao . On the other hand , the Wapare of the I Tanganyika province , near neighbors of the Wataweta , in order to keep their young girls out of harm 's way , were , and perhaps still are , in the habit of shut ! ling them up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confinement , in lofts built into the roofs of their huts ! They were never allowed to go out , but were otherwise well taken care of . If , in the same tribe , a boy and girl sinned against custom , their lives were forfeited , and they were killed in the way in which , according to Moses ( Numbers 25:8 ) , Phinehas killed the Israelite , the daughter of a Prince of the Midianites . The Elgon natives of the Kenyia province shut up all the boys , every evening , in double-story buildings , and a watch is set over them . It is to be feared , however , that those tribes which are concerned about the proper behavior of their maidens before marriage , are not so from any appreciation , or even comprehension , of ' virtue ' in the white man 's sense of the word . Chastity merely increases the girl 's value as a commercial asset . That this is the case follows from the fact that it is insisted upon chiefly in those tribes where the girl is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself consulted ; while it is treated as a negligible quantity where the girl 's consent is a condition of marriage . Nothing could be simpler than the process by which , to-day , in Nyasaland , a man and a woman enter matrimony . The following account gives a good idea of how it is generally done . I asked Soliman how he got his wife . He said : ' I met her on the road and gave her tobacco . Shortly afterward she came in to my but and brought ugali ( porridge ) . I asked : " For whom is this ugali ? " She replied : " It is for you . " I then asked her : " Why do you bring me ugali ? " She replied : " Because I want you very much . " I said : " But you have a husband already . " She replied : " No ! my husband left me a long time ago . " I said : " This is surely a lie . " She said : " It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I then went and asked her brother , and he said : " She has told you the truth : her hus- band left her a long time ago . " I then went to my own brother his eldest brother and asked him if he had any objection to my courting that woman . He said he had none and so she came to live with me . ' In due time , when the two came to the conclusion that these existed no radical incompatabilite d'leumeur , the preliminary arrangement became a permanent one . What applies to the courting of grown-up women applies in an equal degree to that of girls . Their freedom of movement is absolute . They will go to a young fellow ' on trial ' without first informing their parents , until , perhaps , one day , the father asks casually : ' Where are you always going to , taking food-stuff with you ? ' The girl then replies : ' I go to a young fellow whom I like very much . ' Then the swain , after having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to manifest curiosity , will go to the latter and tell him that he wants his daughter ; and then the father will say : Go and speak with her brother . ' It is always the brother , or the uncle on the mother 's side , who is consulted as the weightiest authority ; but this is not to be looked upon as a disregard of parental authority ; quite the contrary , parents are considered to stand so high above their children , that to consult them in anything , or even to begin a conversation with them , would be an unthinkable piece of audacity on the children 's part . Before the two young people agree to live with one another , there is always the same exchange of questions and answers , almost like a ritual : ' Have you not got another man . ' ' No ! ' Surely you lie ; you have another man ! " No , truly ; I am telling the truth . ' The brother is then called upon , for confirmation or otherwise . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover that they eat , not agree , or if the family of one of two parties objects to the choice made , they separate . In one case , for stance , in which one of my servants wanted to marry a young girl , the latter 's family decided , after she had come to live with him , to settle in an . other district . Now , among the Wayao , as a general rule , , the husband follows the woman and lives in her village . But in this case the bridegroom 's family , a body against whose decisions there is no appeal , declared with one accord that they did not wish him to leave the district in which they were living . So there was nothing left for the two but to separate . I felt very sorry for them both ; but when I asked Hassan , full of sympathy , if he felt very sorry that the girl was leaving him he laughed , and said : ' Not at all ! ' He was thinking , no doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come out of it . As long as the bridegroom lets in. curred no expenses on behalf of his lady , and as long as the relations of both have not been formally and solenudy informed of the union , the separation is not treated as being of any impel. tance . But where all these conditions have been fulfilled , it is sure to he followed by litigation . If the native woman 's conduct as a spouse , looked at from the white man 's point of view , leaves much to be desired , it must be proclaimed , on the other side , that no words of praise could el en approximately do justice to her in her character as housewife and as mother . Her thrift , her patience , her endue ante , her uncomplaining and quiet cheerfulness , are the incomparable qualities against which her husband has nothing to put into the balance except official representation and the prestige of masculine strength , which , as a protection , is becoming more and more superfluous . i Long before sunrise , long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water from the lake or from the river . On many occasions this function is accompanied by personal danger , as , for instance , when the only water- ; supply is a river or a lake infested with crocodiles ; or when man-eating lions happen to be about . These generally choose their victims from women who are on their way to the water or return-nt , c from it . I have known of many such casualties ; yet I never heard of any woman making this a pretext for staying at home . Other occupations fill the day , from morning till night : wood-chopping , grain-pounding and winnowing , hoe-$ ing , planting , cooking , nursing the children , fetching mud for the huts and ; ; applying it ( the frames are erected he the men ) , besides , in some places , making pottery ? an art reserved to women , some of whom are clever artists in this industry . h When one asks the men what part of the work is left for them to do , as the tt women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but do not we tt get the money for the women to buy cloth with , by hiring ourselves out to tt Europeans ? Where are the women to it get money from , if we do not get it for them ? ' So great is the glamour attached to money in the native mind , that a man who , by a few months ' work on a plantation or as a boy , ' has earned enough - ' o pay the hut-tax and to buy a few tie ; of malice , is satisfied that he has lone ample justice to his part of the ontract , and that he fully deserves , or the rest of the year , his otium cum ' ignitate . The of native women to their surroundings , and their equanimity under all circumstances , are remarkable . They are very like gypsies in this respect . Those who follow their husbands on a journey , with or without children , often without any necessity and only for the fun of the thing , find themselves as much at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in their own village ; and their babies are just the same . Yet another great quality of these women is the small amount of noise which they make . All the chattering , all the loud laughing and talking is done by the men , who are engaged in incessant conversation on the most futile subjects from morning till evening , and often , when there is a moon shining , all through the night , too , as natives enjoy the invaluable faculty of being able to remain awake at will , without exercising the slightest effort . In a camp , women are scarcely ever heard , unless one of them happens to have a hysterical fit . Black babies are as admirable as their mothers . They are simply wonderful ! Nobody who has not lived in close proximity to them for some time can realize how noiseless they are . Once only in twenty-five years has a black child kept me awake during the night ; and I do not know to this day what the reason was , as I arrived after dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I once asked a Yao why black babies make so little noise compared with white ones , he replied : ' The European father teaches his child to make plenty noise and to break everything it touches , because , if it does not , he thinks it is ill . ' The placidity and the contentment of native as compared with European babies is due , no doubt , to their close companionship with their mother , from whom they are as inseparable , mutatic mutandis , as little kangaroos from theirs . During the first years of their life , they spend nearly all their time snugly and comfortably berthed in the lcuveleha , the pouch formed by the cloth slung over their mother 's back . If they want to sleep , they sleep ; when they are awake , there is always something interesting to see , or to hear , by peeping round the corner . The larder is always full , the table always laid , the perambulator always ready to start ; they are kept warm by the best and most natural of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under all circumstances , and in all conceivable postures , must be the consequence of this existence of the child on its mother 's back where it undergoes all imaginable variations of tossing ; for , whatever may be the nature of the work in which the woman is engaged , she scarcely ever puts the baby down . And the skill with which she manages to carry , besides , on her head , heavy logs of wood , or a hoe which often balances within an inch of the small passenger 's head , is both marvelous and appalling , as it also testifies to her strength of nerve . Often have I been made quite anxious by thus seeing babies , in imminent danger as I imagined , of being brained ; and I have even seen native men who were affected the same way ; and I have heard them call out to the women to be careful . Yet it would appear as if nothing ever happened . I once asked a man if he remembered , in his lifetime , a baby having been injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes , ' he replied at once ; I remember very well , a long time ago , at such and such a place . ' And what happened ? ' I asked ; ' did the poor child die ? " Die ? No ! ' was the reply ; there was a little blood , though . ' It occurs from time to time that women have hysterical fits ? fits which have the same character in tribe : settled thousands of miles apart . Om hears sometimes that the reason ashy the Chinese occasionally run amok t the snapping of the bonds of self-re , straint imposed upon them by theit crowded existence ; the fits of black women may have the same origin , There is , however , nothing dangerous or violent about them . They consist , as a rule , in an avalanche of words , chiefly accusations and complaint , which nothing on earth except violence can stop , culminating sometimes in a headlong flight from the village into the bush , with the avowed intention to await death there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it comes to this . Husbands , when their wives are taken that way , have two alternatives : either to beat them nand they stop , or to run away and keep at a distance until the hurricane has passed . As was indicated above , among the Wayao and those tribes which their influence has penetrated , woman asks supreme in the household and in the village . I have spoken with many men who , after some hesitation , ended by admitting it . In the villages it is the women who make or mar reputations , as they did in Europe before the advert of the suffragette , and in the house the men follow their advice in almost everything . It is they who decide whether a stranger shall be allowed to settle in the village and to remain there , and whether one of the community who , for some reason or other , is making himself obnoxious , shall be give. , by the men , the consiliuon abovull . When the wife of a native servant desires a change , she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much he may like it personally . ' Boys who have been scolded in the presence of their women invariably give notice ; most thefts committed by men are duo to direct or indirect instigation by their wives . Black men are extremely sensithe to ridicule , and what they fear more than anything else , is to appear ' ; ridiculous or weak before their women . The latter know this , and harp on that string with consummate virtuosity . What gives the women of the Wayao such a hold over the men is the unique custom that , after marriage , the man follows the woman to her village , not vice versa ; and if , later , the man goes to reside in another place , ? as , for in-. stance , when he finds employment on a plantation , ? it seems to be left to his wife 's discretion entirely , whether she shall follow him or not . Frequently she refuses . ? I once had a servant named Moses a good-natured , blear-eyed , pockmarked , flat-nosed , squat fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dealings with the fair sex . One clay he informed me that he had got a new wife ( his third ) , and that she wanted to come and live with him . So I put at his disposal a large and comfortable lmt which stood empty . But anything like the tantalizing behavior of this princess could not be imagined ! For weeks she kept on sending messages announcing her impending arrival , without ever turning up . I tried , by scathing comments , to rouse poor Moses , who was daily growing more depressed , to an assertion of his authority ; but he was evidently much too afraid of being deserted , to risk incurring his Dulcinea 's displeasure . One rooming , when I asked him if his bride had at last arrived , he replied , = in English , which he spoke rather well : ' No ; she sent her little sister instead ; did you not see that little girl who came yesterday ? ' Why on earth does she send you a little girl ? ' I said ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To this he replied , in a meek and despondent tone of voice : ' A little sister-in-law for me . ' Finally he made up his mind to give in , and left me to join her . Just as in Europe , it frequently happens that mere boys marry women twice their age , and sometimes nearly twice their size . They make devoted husbands , as long as it lasts ; but I imagine that they are rather henpecked as a rule . In one such case which I remember , the wife , a giantess , whom her boyish husband had been carrying , figuratively speaking , on his hands , at last brought matters to a head by requesting him to cook her food ! This was too much , and he gave her up that very day . Yet , such is the power of conventionality , that , if the husband 's brother , or his maternal uncle , come on a visit , the wife will at once leave the but and sit by herself , alone and disconsolately , at some distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her why she acts in this way , she replies : Ninoona haya : ( I feel shy . ) The visitor , if the same question was put to him , would probably say , as an explanation needing no further comment : ' Is she not my daughter-in-law ? ' One of the chief reasons for the differences between man and wife , which incessantly occur in Nyasaland and are more frequent there than in any other part of Africa which I have visited , is the ease with which the women absent themselves from their homes for varying lengths of time . A pretext is never wanting , and is apparently always taken for granted by the confiding husband . I have known a Ngoni woman to leave her invalid husband all alone for six weeks ; and when I asked him why he consented to being thus deserted in his helpless state , he explained , with perfect equanimity , that she had followed up-country a debtor who owed her sixpence ! Native women who run short of pro- visions often remedy this by repairing to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundant , and there hire themselves out to take a hand in pounding it , for remuneration in kind . This offers an opportunity for an absence of many days ' duration , during which the control of the movements of the absentee ladies by their husbands is a complicated affair , and quite out of the question when the latter are in fixed employ . It is deplorable to have to admit that the black woman of British Central Africa , with all her admirable qualities , is sorely lacking in the one essential virtue of her sex . With the sole exception , possibly , of the few Christian women who belong to the nucleus of bona fide converts surrounding mission stations , no native woman is capable of even faintly suspecting that her white sister 's attitude toward certain problems of life is either beautiful or reasonable . A redeeming , although rather ludicrous feature of the question is , that Isokle is expected to make , without delay , full confession of her fault to her husband , who otherwise would die if he partook of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the natives of Nyasaland , and confessions of this kind are of very common occurrence . A somewhat similar idea is the universal belief that a woman whose husband has been unfaithful will grow ill and die of her next child ; or that a child at the breast will die if its father is unfaithful to the mother . All the deaths of women with child , or of a child at the breast , are attributed to this cause . Nothing , however , appears to happen nowadays to the guilty father , except that he is excluded from the family mourning ceremonies . Open acts of revenge by an injured husband are extremely rare , but that passion may be exercised in a way which can not be brought home to him That this sometimes happens I more than suspect ? merely from the char. acter of the people . Also , complete indifference is often assumed , in order to procure convincing proof . But even where this has been forthcoming , the end of the whole intrigue , as a rule , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic than an endless palaver between the families of the two parties , where the fine payable by the guilty person is definitely fixed . Rarely does it happen that even the most incorrigible of flirts is dismissed by her husband , if she is otherwise of an amiable disposition . One evening I was awakened by the sound of blows and of a woman screaming . It came from the but of a man whom I knew , the the owner of two wives , one of whom was elderly and steady , the other a wayward young gazelle , who laud already twice spontaneously confessed that she had listened to the advances of a neighboring Don Juan . I rushed to the hut ; but when I arrived there , I found the husband only and the first wife ; the second wife , caught listening to the blandishments of the neighbor , had , I was told , run away . As I feared that he might base seriously injured the girl , I told the man that , unless he produced her , unhurt , within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Resident . I waited two days , and then both ap . pared before me , smiling , hand in hand They were still living together , and on the best of terms , two years later . The absolute immorality of the women of Nyasaland , strange to say , goes along with a modesty , both of word and gesture , in both sexes , which could not be excelled in the most respectable and collet-mont6 community of white people . Exceptions occur only when a woman gets drunk . 9 The rule as to what constitutes and what destroys the respectability of a grown-up woman is a different one in almost every tribe . Where morality is practically nonexistent , as among the women of the Nyasa Basin , nothing , ? that a woman could do o IOUS3 , reek ! injure her honor . Among the Wakinga of the Livingstone Range , again , a hardy race of mountaineers , women are forbidden two things : to accept money in return for their favors , and to bestow them on men not of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , the total absence of all disease ? an inestimable boon , perhaps unique in the world . t But whether this happy state of affairs t has Off ived the ' passing of the days 2 of war ' is , alas , another question . The Masai woman , in the Nyika of what HOW forms the Kenyia and the Tanganyika provinces , is a model spouse ; ' h but the unwritten law of the nation imposes upon her husband the duty temporarily to surrender his house and its inhabitants to any one of the El ' morao ( members of the warrior caste , nice are bound to celibacy as long as they belong to it ) who desires to take possession of them , and to keep away as long as he sees the latter 's long spear sticking in the ground in front of the door . This husband was an Elmoran himself before his marriage . ( Ethically , there is a great resemg Hance between all native women , from the Juba to Capetown ; but physically they are as different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the kind of ornaments best adapted to their particular style of t beauty vary even more . Most Europeans , I believe , imagine that , although a Negro woman may have a fine figure , the general type of the features is always the same , and shaped , more or less , on the lines of the ( traditional black woman of story- , books . No idea could be more erroneous and more unjust . People may differ as to the question whether perfect classic beauty is compatible with a black skin ; but , leaving the Somali out of the question altogether , because it is not quite certain if , black though they are , one is justified in calling them Negroes , there can be no two opinions as to whether an ebony Venus of Milo ? the term black , when applied to the human skin , has as many shades as the spectrum ? is not occasionally met with , very much alive , indeed , among the Wagala or the Waswahili . Perfectly regular features are probably more frequent among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Italians , or the Greeks . Besides , the headdress of the women of these tribes ? small curls arranged on both sides of the central , longitudinal parting , and converging toward a small tuft , just above the nape of the neck ? is not unlike the classic ideal . The headdress of the Masai and the Wataweta women , where beautiful faces , although of a somewhat different type , are just as frequent as among the tribes just mentioned , is also very becoming and very striking , consisting , as it does , of leather bands forming a kind of skullcap on top , and hanging down on both sides of the face , like the curls of our grandmothers , terminating in huge , brightly polished metal discs , the whole being rather suggestive of the faces of saints on Greek icons . Unfortunately , these women shave off their eyebrows , as did the Gioconda and her contemporaries . But neither the Ssvahili nor the Masai headdress has , so far , been universally adopted as a fashion ; and no woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that of the serpent of old Nile ' herself , can with impunity support a black woolen pincushion in lieu of a chevelure. 196 FEMINISM IN NYASALAND Native women , who have not grown either self-conscious or bold by much intercourse with Europeans , often have charming manners : the low laugh , the graceful movements of the head , the subdued gestures , the total absence of affectation ( which is in itself the hallmark of good breeding ) ? no grande dame in Europe could excel them in these ; and those whom age has deprived of the charm of youth often astonish the stranger by their wisdom and their sense of humor . It is a moment of ever-recurring surprise and wonder to me , that the very tribes in which women enjoy the greatest freedom and have most power , namely , the Wayao and the Wanyanja , are also those in which they are ugliest , and where , besides , they do their best to increase this ugliness by disfiguring themselves with their idiotic ornaments . These ' improvements ' are threefold ; about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breasts , the less said the better . The other two are called , respectively , the chipini and the pelele . Both are studs . The chipini is worn in the side of the nose , the pelele half-way between the nose and the upper lip . The chipini is one inch across , the pelele often much larger ! Indian women sometimes wear a small piece of jewelry in the nose , which looks very pretty . Natives , however , can do nothing in moderation , and the enormous chipini distorts the wearer 's nostril , down and sideways , across half the cheek . It looks horrid enough when the chipini is worn ; but when it has been lost , or sold , there remains nothing but the gap where it ought to be ; and the impression given is that of a permanent disfigurement due to some accident . I remember that , when I came to Nyasaland and saw for the first time a woman who had left her chipini at home , I thought she was ill , and told my attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ! Natives always avois giving a direct reply if they can , ear so the answer which I received in the case was that , perhaps ' there we nothing the matter with the lady 's nose . The women themselves could prob . ably be prevailed upon to give up wearing these horrible things ; but , unfortunately , the men like them , and encourage them to wear them . A Ino , a great Don Juan , once announced to me that he intended going in search of another wife . I wished . him good luck and added : ' I hope you will find a pretty wife , one who does not wear that dreadful chipini . ' ' What ! ' he exclaimed , horrified ; nothing at all , like a man ? ' If the chipini is bad , the pelele is worse . A peculiarity of the natives of the Nyasa Basin , some Wangoni cc. cepted , is the great distance between the nose and the upper lip ; the line , besides , projects outwards at an angle from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midway between the nose and the lip that the pelele is worn , and one asks one 's self whether the length of that line is due to the wearing of the pelele through countless generations , or whether the pelele was put there to relieve its monotony . The natives hate a theory to explain the invention . They say that , when a woman grows old , she loses her front teeth , and that then her upper lip , by getting into the mouth , prevents her from talking distinctly ; but that the pelele keeps the lip up , and that those who wear it can talk just as distinctly without front teeth as with them . Possibly ! But why , then , do not the old men wear a pelele , too ? They never do . There exists a surprising similitude between the lower part of the face of a woman who wears the pelele and the beak of the female trumpet hornbill , ? I the Hondo-Hondo of the natives , ? a bird Which is indigenous ( although not I exclusively so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While the stale Hondo-Hondo carries , over beak and forehead , the helmet of a I Roman centurion , his partner contents I herself with a round disc , like a pelele in shape and size , which site wears midi wav between the root of the bill and its tip . The resemblance is so striking , that the observer involuntarily asks himself if it is not due to something more than a coincidence ! Can it not I he that , in the long , long ago , some of the women decided to follow the bird 's I example , as a new and original attraction in their intercourse with man ? I Or was it a sultan , perhaps , wino , in a barbarous humor , experimented as to how his women would look with the female hornbill 's jewel , and thus set the fashion ? t Unlike the chipini , the pelele is , fortunately , disappearing . It is scarcely cone met wills , now , in the Shire high-I hinds , although the people to the east of Lake Nyasa still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing their best to induce the children to refuse to I undergo the perforation above the lip , hick is necessary for the insertion of the stud . II The indifference of natives to human physical beauty , which practically g ' accounts to its total elimination as a factor in the relations between the sexes , has often been commented upon . A native whose attention you draw to it the handsome features of another native ? either woman or man ? always responds vaguely , indifferently , I ; never emphatically , rather giving the g impression that inc does not quite understand what you mean . It is significant that there exists , in the Swahili language , no word which expresses handsome , or beautiful , exclusively . The word zuri , the only one used in this sense , means good , as well as beautiful , the first idea conveyed , when it is applied to a person , being always that of moral , rather than physical , excellence . The incongruity which often exists between parties forming a union , almost suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations . And yet it would probably be incorrect and unjust to explain the phenomenon by the preponderance of mere brute sensuality over all finer feelings ; for it can not be denied that natives are by no means devoid of a sense of beauty . They admire it in animals , in flowers , in pictures , landscapes , and music ; they have clever artists ; and their perception of what is ridiculous in expression or appearance is perhaps keener than that of the average European , notwithstanding their passion for the odd and the baroque . One might say , that their indifference to beauty is confined exclusively to sex-relations , or that their aesthetic sense is in default only where these relations come into play . The explanation of this bizarre trait in the character of the African Negro can perhaps be found in the surmise expressed by the famous author of The Traveling Diary of a Philosopher , that natives of the Tropics can not feel love as we do , our love being founded entirely on an imaginative power which they do not possess ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an essential condition of the faculty to appreciate physical beauty .
