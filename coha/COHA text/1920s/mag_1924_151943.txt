The following estimates of books much in the public eye were made after careful consideration of the trend of critical opinion : <P> THE GOLDEN BED-Wallace Irwin- Putnam ( $2.00 ) . When Flora Lee Peake lay down to sleep , in blanched linen cool and lavendered , four rosewood bedposts carved in the images of four great swans watched her dreaming face , and over her lay a coverlet of antique French lace pricked with a legend that one did not translate aloud . With Admah Holtz , things were otherwise . His white-trash father drank himself to death , day by day , in the cabin kitchen where Ma Holtz made peppermint-drops for her son to hawk in the streets . Sometimes the girls in Miss Martincastle 's school patronized him , Flora Lee once among them . Having seen , Admah never forgot her . Her arrogant and perfumed phantom lived in his memory while he put the peppermints behind a counter , bought a candy store , a chain of them , became Candy Holtz , leading citizen . The Peakes went down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old mansion was put up at auction ; he bought the bed and coverlet and sent them to Flora Lee , with his compliments . She married him for his money and went systematically about softening him , as tainted honey rots the oak that chambers it . He lost his wealth , she deserted him , then both followed their blood until he was a river front soak , and she , one gusty night , crept back back to die in the old house on Innes street under the coverlet whose motto was : " The dog for faithfulness , the pheasant for luxury , the swan for lust . " <P> There is a happy ending , deftly provided , that does not matter . What does matter is a novel that presents almost perfectly a tragic , if common , social phenomenon-a novel with guts and sinew under its smooth skin of literary urbanity . <P> THE TATTOOED COUNTESS-Carl Van Vechten-Knopf ( $2.00 ) . Fleshy and fleshly , but not without wisdom , is the Countess Nattatorrini after 20 years of middle-aged self-indulgence . Sneaking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car ( anno 1897 ) , she reflects upon her frothy life as the widow of an Italian noble , upon opera , jewels , acquaintances raffines no end , upon a hulking lover she kept all unfortunately . In Maple Valley , she is welcomed for having been baptized there . Ella Poore was her Main Street name and since she left there have sprung up a new depot , waterworks , brick paving . The Countess is euchred , kettle-drummed , lap-suppered , picnicked , violently bored in every small-town way . Then up turns Gareth Johns , curly-headed , 17 , and articulate . She enfolds him in her ample eroticism , he in his hunger for the horizon . Off they go together to the everlasting hurt of Lennie Colman , Gareth 's tragic schoolmarm . Village Parcae squawk the devil 's chorus . <P> One feels kindly toward the author for having written The Tiger in the House Peter Whiffle and The Blind Bow Boy . But this Countess tale levies a supertax on one 's patience , so full is it of bad writing mingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real understanding .
