txt Atlantic Gulf &; West Indies Steamship Lines decision to enter the oil business was due to the realization that in normal times steamship earnings might not prove equal to interest dividnede and requirements say Hayden . Stone Ca . The letter continues in part : " Once embarked upon its oil development . Atlantic Gulf directors have been most careful to diversify their risk to the greatest pus-Able decree . Atlantic Gulf 011 program when completed as it should be by the middle of 1921 , will involve a total outlay of perhaps $00,000,000 and of this about $9,000,000 , or only 15% will represent the investment in Mexican oil production . The actual investment in French pipe lines and refineries will be 33% larger than the total commitment in Mexico . France is admitted by oil authorities to be the best oil selling territory in Europe . " The same general situation exists in England , except that the investment consists in refineries rather than pipe lines and refineries as in France . In both countries Atlantic Gulf is working in close co-operation with the ablest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,500,000 on account of Colombian oil developments . Half of this money is secured by the note of a well-established oil company , whose credit is ample to insure its payment . The Colombian expenditure must be frankly admitted to be the most speculative outlay which Gulf has made in on , . It is also the most promising for the future , The acreage controlled by this Colombian group ahonld in time provide a great reservoir of oil erupply when Atlantic Gulf 's Mexican fields have declined . It is , perhaps , stdricient to say that drilling is now in progress in Colombia with every prospect that the first omens will be in by Christmas . " Slightly more than 50% of Atlantic ( Gulfs of investteent is in tankers or approximately $34,000,000 . This constitutes what it Is believed will be the company 's prinOpal permanent earning asset in the oil industry , irrOrpeetive of the continued flowage of the Mexican wells .

They are under charter at very attractive rates . Furthermore , three other tankers , due within the next month , will also go out on charter . So firm have beenithe charter rates for tankers that Atlantic Gulf could today charter Its entire fleet of 14 tankers were they completed at rates which would show net equal in two years to the entire property invested . In short , Atlantic Gulf has every right to expect the accumulation in the next two years of net income from tanker , that will enable it to write the cost of this 174,000 tons of oil bearing tonnage entirely of the books . Practically speaking , this would mean the accumulation in the Gulf treasury of some millions of investment funds .
