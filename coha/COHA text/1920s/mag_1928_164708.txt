People called him a martyr to science . He left an estate of only $12,000 . Last week , the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research announced that it would award a suitable pension to the widow of Martyr Noguchi . Another distinguished yellow fever worker is Dr. Aristides Agramonte , native of Havana , Cuba . He is the sole surviving member of the heroic Army Commission of the U. S. , which in 1900 went into Cuba determined to clear up the mystery of yellow fever .
