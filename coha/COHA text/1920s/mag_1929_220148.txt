( See front cover ) <P> No royal wedding seems ever quite complete without a bomb , and a bomb there was , last week , for Crown Prince Olaf of Norway and his bride , Sweden 's grave and lovely Princess Martha . In placing such royal nuptial dynamite-this time a whole kilogram-the usual thing is to plant it in the storied castle where the Prince and Princess expect to make their home . Therefore , last week experienced Norwegian police searched and searched every nook and cranny in and about Castle Oskarshal , until they found and nullified the nuptial bomb . <P> Smart international yachting folk who have sailed up the pine-fringed Kristiania Fjord to the capital of Norway , Oslo , will remember Castle Oskarshal . As they cast anchor off the Royal Yacht Club , in the wimpling Frognerkilen , they had Oslo on their starboard and suburban Bygdo , with its Castle Oskarshal , on their port . <P> Also plainly visible from the fjord is Norse King Haakon 's long , plaster-white Kongelige Slot or royal palace .

As every Scandinavian knows the Kings of Sweden were also the elected Kings of Norway from 1814 until 1905 , when the Storting ( parliament ) dissolved the union with Sweden , elected Prince Christian of Denmark King of Norway , proclaimed him " King Haakon VII " - thus reviving the traditions of the ancient and extinct native royal line of Norway-and finally declared the present dynasty hereditary . To Oslo with King Haakon VII came the Princess he had married in 1896 , the youngest ( third ) daughter of His Majesty Edward VII , British King and Emperor , to reign as inconspicuous and reserved but very popular Queen Maud of Norway . <P> Thus last week nothing could have been more appropriate than the arrival at Oslo of Britain 's tall Duke and plump Duchess of York in the quality of wedding guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke , and Her Majesty responded graciously , " Welcome to Norway , Albert .
