Where does a college student live ? Where should he cast his vote ? The answers , of course , vary with the students . An orphan student might have no other legal domicile than his dormitory . Perhaps any student 's dormitory rooms are or may be his voting residence , since at most institutions dormitory space is leased for a whole year and most election laws require only a few months ' residence . <P> In Princeton , N.

Their citizenship , mostly newborn , surged within them . Their patriotism , not unmixed with less grandiose emotions common to young-manhood everywhere in football season , mounted to heights that made police reserves from Trenton seem necessary to the peace of Princeton . False fire alarms were sent in . A student mob of riotous proportions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A passing motor bus and all its passengers received a thoroughgoing shake on Nassau street . Dean Mauss strode out to quiet his charges . They ignored him and roistered long and late . <P> But the registrars stood firm . Only a modicum of relief in special cases was expected from the County election board . <P> <P> *Princeton Theological Seminary students are colloquially called " Seminoles. "
