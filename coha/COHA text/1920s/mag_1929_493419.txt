A Little German Band The Solemnities of Gestalt Psychology GREAT is the enthusiasm of their playing and ardent is the look in their eyes . Their repertoire is not large , but what matter ? They have at least one number that is as sure-fire as " Dixie " and whenever the audience stops beating time , back they come to their favorite . It runs something like this : Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall , Humpty Dumpty had a great fall , And all the king 's horses and all the king 's men Could n't put Humpty together again . The major theme of that brand of psychology currently being imported from Germany is a pro ? longed complaint about the scandalous manner in which other psychologies break up their essential facts beyond recognition and repair . If the Gestalt ? ists ever spoke of such important matters , they would charge the barbarians with seeing nothing in Mr. George Herman Ruth save a series of connec ? tions between sense organs and muscles brought about through the pressure of the American en ? vironment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would even worry lest some con ? temporary analyst should find nothing in Niagara ? Falls-by-moonlight save a conglomeration of yellows and grays and glassy sensations impinging upon an awareness of visceral tension . This little band of German professors would hardly deny that there can be found in the personality of Mr. Ruth vari ? ous connections between sense organs and muscles that are essential for his artistry . They would hardly deny either the yellows and grays and glassi ? nesses nor the visceral tensions of Niagara-by-moon ? light . What irritates them is the fact that psychol ? ogists , in their enthusiasm for the detection of such ingredients of behavior and experience , have for ? gotten the limitations of their procedure . When we tear a thing apart , we arrive at the parts , but necessarily leave the thing behind . The thing was the parts combined in a certain way , and the fact that analysis may give a very complete accounting for the parts does not at all mean that it gives a good picture of their mode of combination or one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing from its fragments . There are two outstanding reasons why this song of lament should have made a great hit . Popular music is never difficult , because it follows closely the most widely established musical conventions of the day . The same is true of systems of psychol ? ogy . If they play upon a theme that is already in the public mind , the public arises to praise their originality . The Gestalt psychology says that there are unities in this world which are not perfectly analagous to strings of sausages . This negation is not exactly new . But its wide popularity is very recent , and now come the Gestaltists to synchronize with this newer philosophic syncopation . This by no means implies that their doctrine is erroneous . It simply explains why it is popular . Another aid toward the popularity of the Gestalt theory is the fact that the world has always been full of people who get shivers up and down their spines whenever they are confronted with the busi ? ness-like procedure of scientific analysis . They have not liked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have something to do with the jerky twitch of a pudgier infant 's hand pouring a cup of gruel into a pink ear . They have not liked the idea that glandular secretions have a good deal to do with ecstasy . They have preferred simply to stand in the midst of life and to feel each thrill to the full as it comes along . Such peo ? ple have been easy marks for a theory that seems to justify their antipathy . There can be no disputing the fact that the pro ? cess of analysis always leads into a realm of relative abstraction . An exhibit containing the separated parts of a motor car is very unlike the living experi ? ence of a mile-a-minute rush down the highway . This is no more and no less true of matters psy ? chological . Such an admission may place a modest feather in the cap of the Gestalt psychologists , but it hardly endows them with a permit to wear a crown . It is an intellectual fashion of the day to point out the obvious truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations . Even when James and Dewey made so much of this point twenty-five or thirty years ago , it was one of those wholesome , homely and familiar items which could well afford the support of such talent , but which was not startlingly novel except for those whose memories were exceedingly short . There is cer ? tainly no harm in the old tune now that it is being played by the Gestaltists , but again there certainly is no genius in it . It is possible that the Gestaltists are really in ? tending more than a warning that every mode of scientific analysis has its limitations . Perhaps they Intend to show that analysis , as such , is inferior to synthesis . If this is the case , the Gestalt psychol ? ogy is guilty of more than an exaggeration . It is indulging in a type of one-eyed vision that has never been known to be either fair or true . If we go back over the history of human thought , we find innumerable instances in which someone becomes aware that a certain very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately concludes that , because there are errors in too much deduc ? tion , induction is necessarily and universally the preferable direction of thought , or because a kind of error is inherent in statistics , statistics always lie . And so one might say that , since the dashing play ? boy of the Post Road is more than steering gear , plus carburetor , plus axles , plus spark plugs and all the other plusses , there is a kind of sin in dis ? cussing the brave roadster 's anatomical units . In order to understand his real nature , one ought simply to seek a long stretch of straightaway and step on the gas . Any claim that analysis , as such , should now be ' foresworn for a procedure less prone to distort the original form of our facts implies that science has so far been largely a failure . That anyone should actually take this position seems almost unbeliev ? able . In the history of science , analysis and syn ? thesis have always gone together . Whenever an ? alysis has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts that the whole could not be resurrected , the actual difficulty has been that the analysis has not yet become as keen as we should like , or as thorough . If analysis of Mr. Ruth into sensory-motor connections and muscle masses does not tell us how we can make fence smashers out of nine-tenths of the male popu ? lation , it does not follow that this great end can be better accomplished without analysis . What is required is better analysis . If that is all the Ge ? staltists mean to say , it is too bad that they do not say what they mean . There is another possibility . Perhaps the exposi ? tors of the Gestaltian propaganda feel that Provi ? dence fashioned them for a moral role . Now , in the field of morals , it is more necessary to make the other fellow right than to be right oneself . Ifthe sinner sins by loafing stubbornly about the north pole , the way to lure him into the balanced right ? eousness of equatorial calm is to extol ! the virtues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's advice only half-heartedly and still be completely saved . In case it should turn out that the Gestaltian atti ? tude toward analysis in general is only to be under ? stood as evangelical exhortation , it would be nec ? essary to look into the world of sin in order to ' determine whether there is justification for the de ? gree of exaggeration being employed . At present there are two widely prevalent analytic procedures in experimental psychology . The first may be called introspective analysis . Its employment requires a subject , who by training has become conversant with the alleged constitution of human experience , to report under special circumstances the make-up of his own awareness . A highly skilled introspector may discover that tickle is analyzable into an irregu ? lar spatial-temporal pattern of bright pressures of low ? intensity coupled with such sensations of mus ? cular tension as commonly anticipate diffuse bodily movement . The reader who takes thought a mo ? ment is likely to put considerable credence in such a result . As he considers his own tickle history , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? trospective expert has pronounced to be there . In this particular example , most of the units into which experience is analyzed happen to be what are called sensations . That is to say , they are such bits of experience as are contributed by the operation of various sense organs . The introspector in his scrutiny of his own awareness often finds other con ? stituent parts besides sensations . He finds mental images , which are analogous to sensations , and which differ from them mainly in the fact that they are not immediately related to the stimulation of a sense organ . He finds feelings , such as pleasant ? ness and unpleasantness . Beyond this there is a realm of controversy . Some introspectors claim to be able to detect other fundamental items of experi ? ence , while their adversaries claim that sensations , images and feelings are the only basic constituents of mind . But most varieties of introspective an ? alysis have this in common , that they seek to break up experience into a limited number of well-defined constituents . The introspectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a state of fervent solicitude . It is , therefore , appropriate to inquire wherein lies their black transgression . In the main , it hinges upon the fact that human experience is not really limited to those ghostly sensations , images and feel ? ings , which arc all that introspection uncovers . The late Professor E. B. Titchener , who was the out ? standing champion of introspective methods in their purest form , had a simple answer to this charge . Granted that human experience contains more than the psychologist finds in it , who would be so ambi ? tious as to attempt to unravel the whole of that ex ? perience ? The psychologist must work with a limited method and for limited ends . If his results // ' do not bear upon all of the implications and heart- throbs of human life , what of it ? What is done can at any rate be done carefully and intelligently . When one finds a sinner with such a sound and simple justification for his sinning , there is a real difficulty in convincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinner . The stock follow-up on the pure introspec ? tor has been to the effect that , though a limited out ? look may at times be required for scientific clarity , a trivial outlook is under no circumstance defen ? sible . And the analysis of experience into sensa ? tions and images and feelings is at best a trivial undertaking . This is rather a mean thing to say , and there is a good deal of question whether it is true . At the moment , scientific interest has turned away from the types of questions that introspective procedure has aimed to answer . Our present very large inventory of visual experience could never have been attained without the strictest type of in ? trospection on the part of highly trained observers , and this inventory forms the basis for the most im ? portant kind of speculation regarding the physi ? ology of the eye . But it so happens that those who are today interested in psychology in a general way are little interested in this type of contribution . Therefore , the struggles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of the system of odor sensations , impress many as being a waste of time . Thus , our inquiry concerning the ways of intro ? spection has not revealed any necessary error bound up with it . The customary criticism of the method indicates that it does not account for the whole of human experience . This point would be exceedingly important to maintain if any one had denied it , but the most ardent advocate of the narrowest type of introspection insisted upon the limitations of this method . However , it might still be true that , though the master spoke with moderation , the dis ? ciples have since gone astray . Such might be the case , but it is not . Perhaps here and there one might find an unimportant person who has swal ? lowed the Titchenerian attitude as a philosophy of Man , but nothing like this has occurred among Titchener 's more capable students . They have all been clearly cognizant of the limitations of intro ? spection . Not only that , but most of them have been inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seemed to them likely to yield valid facts about human nature . The Gestaltists are certainly trying to reform someone who takes introspection too seriously . But who can that someone be ? Perhaps it is one of those ferocious windmills of the imagination kept in a menacing state of revolution by the breath of much scolding . The second prevalent method of analysis in ex ? perimental psychology is carried out in terms of objective behavior . The subject need not be highly trained . Although his testimony regarding his own behavior may be sought , he is expected to give only such a report as commends itself to his common sense . The principal data utilized by this method are the gross bodily movements , the verbal re ? sponses , and those physiological reactions like pulse , blood pressure and breathing rate that can be in ? strumentally recorded . Contrary to popular belief , this type of procedure is nota new-fangleTiriven ? tion of Watsonian behaviorism . It was the first method of experimental psychology ; the notion o- ? . expert introspection and the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un ? til experimental psychology was well under way as an active science . But the business with which we are now con ? cerned is the attitude of the Gestaltists toward the objective analysis of behavior . Are its sins so great as to require dark frowns and " Naughty ! Naughty 1 " regarding analysis in general ? If one goes through a fair sampling of behavior studies , he will discover that in many cases analysis of a given act is incomplete either on the side of the ingredients of that act or on the side of their mode of combination . One will also find a good many authors who try to justify their efforts by the contention that the elements of a complex act , which they do not uncover , must be inconsequential . Ergo , behavior is only what they are now able to see in it . Finding a few throat movements in the metaphy ? sician , thinkers of this variety will maintain that metaphysics is nothing but a series of laryngeal oscillations . Finding a few chemical changes in the active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shifting of electron aggregations . This is clearly an unwholesome state of mind , and one deserving vigorous imprecation . The Gestalt ? ists would say that there has been a desertion of the staid monogamy of the whole in favor of a dis ? solute promiscuity of the parts . It is doubtful , how ? ever , whether the evil is such a grand one . There is a good deal to be said for the verdict that the case is simply one of lack of modesty . Science has not yet outgrown its relations to witchcraft , even in the minds of scientists themselves . Therefore , when an analysis proves incomplete , as analyses always do , there is a temptation to argue away that incompleteness . The alternative to such ha ? ranguing-is not abstinence from analysis , but merely the cultivation of a reasonable degree of modesty about science in general , and the courageous facing of a future full of honest ignorance and intellectual labor . It is easy to see that the Gestaltists dislike all current types of psychological analysis . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? lieve that analysis as such is wicked or that analysis has thus far been iniquitously practiced , but certainly they would have us make a radical change in psychological procedure . They would have us search experience and behavior for properties of organ ! , , ii ized wholes , rather than for such parts as can read ? ily be conceived to owe none of their essential characteristics to the wholes in which they happen to occur in any given instance . With proper apology for such unsolicited publicity , let us again turn our attention to the activity of Mr. Ruth . What would a plain , unenlightened psychologist say about the matter ? What would the Gestaltist 's creed require ? The unenlightened one would attempt a kind of inventory of all that goes on during the Herculean production of a four-base wallop . What do the legs do and when do they do it ? What do the arms do ? What do the eyes do ? How does the body sway ? What does the great man think about ? Does he say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a fast one ! " Or does a calm and even skepticism give way im ? perceptibly to accurate anticipation ? When such matters as these had been separately determined , or even before all of them had been determined , the plain psychologist would want to know the rela ? tionships between actions of arms and legs and eyes and brain . He would not stop to remark that the performances of these various members be ? long to an organized whole , knocking-the-ball-over ? the-fence . If they did not , he would not now be giving them attention . But he would wonder about how these particular parts ever came to belong to this particular whole . He knows that Mr. Ruth had arms and legs , and eyes and brain , long before this organization of his actions became a fact , and so the psychologist would assume that something has gone on during this man 's earlier history to make him precisely what he is today . The plain psychologist might actually investigate that past history , or he might attempt its reconstruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of skill . Now it is hard to see how such interests and procedures constitute a flight from the reality of the whole to the artificiality of disconnected parts . The primary interest is in the whole busi ? ness of knocking a home run . But remember that explanation can never come in terms of that which we would explain . Into the explanation of Mr. Ruth 's achievement we may introduce the move ? ments of his various muscles , their relations one to the other , and such matters as his state of mind . We may describe the lad of thirty years ago and trace his changing capabilities with the passing years . But the explanation of Mr. Ruth that throws least light upon his organized behavior is the fact that his behavior is organized . For the plain psy ? chologist , that fact is the problem ; it can not also be the solution . He would , of course , recognize that the total integratedness of the home-run king might conceivably explain something . If a Hottentot should enter the Yankee stadium and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be logically valid ( though it might not be informing ) to remark that it is because this act is an inseparable aspect of hitting a home run . But the psychologist would hardly choose the wily of the club swinging as his problem . He would be more likely to take the how of the home run . VVe may now turn to the manner in which the Gestaltist would investigate the same phenomenon . If he were as anxious to avoid analysis as his literal words sometimes indicate , he would have to con ? tent himself with a kind of all-embracing empathy of the royal swat . But if one is to judge by such investigations as he has actually performed , one would expect him to proceed straightway to an analysis of home-run hitting , but one would also expect this analysis to be somewhat disguised by the fact that the parts and characteristics into which he would break the whole would not be conventional parts . The Gestaltist would note that from Mr. Ruth 's own point of view , the total field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fence , has background and foreground . As long as he insisted that this division was in characteristics of a whole experience and not in the nature of its parts , his procedure would not disturb his conscience . He might be interested in the genetic story of how this expert got that way , though we might predict from his past performance that he would have little taste for doing more in this regard than referring to the fact that Mr. Ruth got that way because of the fact that properly constituted individuals would naturally tend to get that way . The Gestaltist has a hearty antipathy for the chaos out of which the plain pyschologist conceives the cosmos of organi ? zation to develop . But if the chaos be not faced , one can not give a genetic story of the cosmos , be ? cause one could say merely that cosmos came from cosmos , and such a story would have no plot . In every step of his effort to explain the integrated whole , the Gestaltist would keep ringing in its wholeness . Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologize by saying that this part is the part that is a part of the whole . Upon such a procedure , two verdicts might possibly be passed . If the Gestaltist 's principal interest were not after all in the whole , he might explain a wide variety of part activities and partial developments by tell ? ing us the wholes to which they belong . In the grandstand he might prove just the guide for a Hottentot whose main perplexity is concerned with the drawing back of the club . If , on the other hand , the Gestaltist 's interest is in those problems that psychologists have long been trying to solve ? in the sources of organization ? then by harping upon organization as the key to organization , he is merely enjoying a dizzy waltz on a dime . The Gestaltists have carried out most of their own investigations in the relatively specialized field of the optical illusions . It is in this connection that practically all of their positive principles have been discussed . There is one broad conception , however , which is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the latest treatments of the subject , insight is that feeling one has when one knows what one is about . Upon first thought there might be some wonder as to how anybody could get excited over such a homely matter . But psy ? chologists have a remarkable capacity for trans forming innocent little facts into serpents of aca ? demic controversy , and their powers of transforma ? tion have not failed them in the present instance . The common man sees no special problem in the fact that he sometimes knows what he is about . He greatly exaggerates the frequency of this event , but it arouses no wonder in him . The only difficulty for him is how he ever acts or thinks or feels with ? out full insight into his own activity . The reason why the notion of an unconscious mind is so satis ? factory to him is that it provides a mythical in ? sight to satisfy the want of an observable one . The psychologist has tended away from the position of the comman man . Having noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? pends upon the clarity of preceding insight , he has developed a good deal of suspicion toward this magic state . He has got so he no longer trusts anything but expert testimony as to whether in a given case such a state of flashing enlightenment has really occurred . And even when sure that some ? thing of the kind has happened , he is not satisfied until he has some good hard facts about it . This latter attitude depends , of course , upon his belief that when a person says " I had an idea , " " I had a hunch , " " It suddenly came to me , " and so on , there are many things that may have taken place . There may have been an elaborate set of relations put straight at the level of thought , and then again there may have been merely a sudden relief from a prolonged postural tension . The point is that the psychologist has relegated to folklore the belief that there is a simple condition of the mind , called understanding , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crucial secrets of com ? ing events . The Gestaltists have returned to the old tale . Although they would grant that one occasionally acts effectively without insight , and that one oc ? casionally comes to grief in spite of insight , they would insist that it is typical for orderly activity to flow out of a flash of understanding . And they have also insisted that insight is not a phenomenon to be skeptical about . It is not to be regarded as meaningless until reduced to more abstract and more certain terms . It is not to be rendered life ? less by classification . Thus , the argument over insight reduces itself to a more general problem of scientific logic , which we have already considered . If one 's interest is in ex ? plaining a given type of event , one can not apply to that business the event itself as constituting an ex ? planatory principle . If one refuses to reduce to lower , colder terms that fact which is one 's major interest , one has only one way out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more thrilling state in which one imbibes in a great gulp the essence of unanalyzed fact . Revolutions have actually taken place in science , but psychology has done its real developing in a gradual fashion . There have been few experiments that have not required the checks and interpreta ? tions produced by scores of later experiments . The larger theories have always been at least as wrong as right , and only with time have their true die ? meits stood out . With such an historical back . ground , one can well afford to be suspicious of those theories that look upon themselves as sudden en ? trances into enlightenment . The Gestaltists have announced that psychology , is very young and they have offered their wares as an elixir of growth . Let us hope that psychology and every other science is young , but there are rea ? sons to believe that their maturation will require more than a fraternity pin and a pair of long pants. ,                 @ @ @ @
