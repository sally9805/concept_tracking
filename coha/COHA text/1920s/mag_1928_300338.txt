A shoe is a commodity . So is a motion picture , a vaudeville act , a radio program . A man who has sold shoes should be able to sell cinemas , acts , broadcastings . So thinks the recently formed Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp . ( TIME , Oct. 15 ) , so thinks Hiram Staunton Brown , its new president . <P> Mr. Brown has resigned from the presidency of U. S. Leather Co. to accept his new position . Says he : " I am going to get right after this thing . ... As I see it , selling entertainment , if you have the goods as the Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp . <P> has , is just the same as selling anything else . " Mr. Brown 's selection occasioned some comment in amusement circles , in as much as Mr. Brown has had no experi ence in amusement enterprises .

In this capacity he earned $5 a week . Making the not un common progression from newspaper to secretarial work , he became secretary to Edward Marshall , the Herald 's foreign correspondent . He was also secretary to William Dinwiddie , Herald war correspondent during the Spanish-American war . After a period of reporting , for the Washington Times , Mr. Brown got into organization work with public utilities . <P> During the War he was chief of the air service finance division . <P> As an amusement purveyor , Mr. Brown will have as assets on hand the Keith-Albee theatre circuit , the F. B. O. Produc tion Co.
