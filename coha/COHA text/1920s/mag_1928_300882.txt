THE HAPPY MOUNTAIN-Maristan Chapman-Viking ( $2.50 ) . <P> KENTUCKY MOUNTAIN FANTASIES-Percy Mackaye - Longmans Green ( $2.50 ) . <P> " Driven to frenzy by the futility of outland interpretation I at last took up the work of their defense " - thus Mrs. Chapman on behalf of the Southern Mountaineers ; and Outlander Mackaye is no doubt one of those who drove her to it . Certainly two interpretations could not differ more radically-Maristan Chapman 's poignant novel of a reticent folk moving slowly to the rhythm of deep passions ; and Percy Mackaye 's lusty plays of primitive types with quick emotion and prompt voluble speech . <P> The Happy Mountain boasts nothing unusual in the way of story : in the springtime a virile lad , poet at heart , leaves his narrow mountain home to see the world . In the autumn he comes back a little worse for wear , disillusioned as to the great beyond . More distinctive than the story is the pungent language . <P> Of the Kentucky Mountain Fantasies the noisy " Funeralizing of Crickneck " is broad comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Napoleon Crossing the Rockies " is unique . A railroad representative tries to bully two old folks to sell their property . Steadfast as the Napoleon of their ditty they refuse this stranger 's heap of gold , but sell to a suave acquaintance who gives the old woman a chain of gaudy beads , and the old man new strings for his fiddle .
