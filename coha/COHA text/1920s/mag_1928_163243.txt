Tempest . The face of John Barrymore is , no doubt , a handsome one . His bare shoulders also have a certain attraction . Observers of Tempest are not allowed to forget these facts , which occupy an inexcusably large amount of the film 's footage . So , it is no wonder that the reputedly " gripping " action drags . Mr. Barrymore is Sergeant Ivan Markov , of peasant birth , who attains a lieutenant 's commission in the Russian army by hard work and through the influence of a kindly general ( George Fawcett ) . Ivan worships the general 's haughty daughter ( Camilla Horn ) , but she treats him as peasant swine . One night , he accidentally falls asleep in her boudoir and is degraded and cast into prison for his ungentlemanly mistake . The prison gives Mr. Barrymore an opportunity to put on the grease paints and a beard , to look horribly woebegone . The Red Revolution releases him from prison and he becomes a peasant dictator . He refuses to be a party to the execution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austrian frontier , while the audience discovers that she loved him all along . ... All of which goes to show that Mr. Barrymore 's stage reputation is being stunted by his film capers . Louis Wolheim , famed in the play , What Price Glory , also figures in Tempest as a fun-loving Russian sergeant . <P> Ramona . Lo , the poor half-Indian , pity her . Her loving husband , a full Indian , is maltreated by the whites in California in the days of ' 49 . Her baby dies because the white physicians will have nothing to do with her . White bandits shoot up her village , kill her Indian friends and her husband . She wanders in the wild woods , brokenhearted . Thus , the popular novel of Helen Hunt Jackson as screened by United Artists . Dolores Del Rio , always throbbing , is at her best . <P> Hangman 's House . An authentic Irish flavor , a grand horse race and a Citizen Hogan ( Victor McLaglen ) who says : " You 'll have to excuse me for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " are refreshing in the film version of Donn Byrne 's fine novel . <P> Steamboat Bill Jr . Buster Keaton is a thimble-witted college boy . His father ( Ernest Torrence ) tries to make him a skipper on a muddy river . They reach a climax in a cyclone . Distinctly not funny .
