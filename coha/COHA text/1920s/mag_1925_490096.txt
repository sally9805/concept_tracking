Notes and Comment IN an age of taxicabs and ponderous limousines , we laud the horse-drawn barouches which lounge along Fifty-ninth street , near the Avenue . They are available in the early morning hours , and their elderly jehus are waking when younger and far less courteous chauffeurs have long since retired . They are ideal for late drives about the Park and perfect for what one philosophical coachman among the lot prescribes for flushed and uncertain fares : The fresh air treatment .

He would . But , anyway , if he really wishes to make it a Greater Movie Season , we suggest that he keep Charlie Chaplin and W. C. Fields at work and give practically all the other screen stars a vacation for a year . An exasperating failing of the movies is that their greatest artists have to be thrust upon them .

Before Mr. Beebe 's departure for the Sargasso , a broker bore on his trail , intent on selling to him , for a William Street company , a blanket policy covering every member of his crew during their voyage of exploration .

But there was no other place to put her . " It 's really nothing , " the hostess explained . " No sights or sounds or anything . The door simply wo n't stay shut during the night , that 's all . No matter what we put against it as a barrier , it pushes open . " Miss Rose 's friend , naturally , was not overcome with enthusiasm at the prospect of passing the night in a haunted room , but , reassured by members of the family , she decided to make the best of it . In the morning she was besieged with questions as to how she had conquered the insurgent door . " I left it open , " she replied .

And these are the horrible details : The French were not doing too well in aviation against the Riffs . They had lost between fifty and sixty planes through the accurate rifle fire of M. Krim 's hordes . And murmurs of these disasters were heard in the land . Even in Paris . Something had to be done . The War Office approached several ex-members of the Lafayette Escadrille , fortunately still resident in Paris , Rumor mentions , among others , Colonel Charles Sweeny , late of the Foreign Legion , Adjutant Chuck Kerwood , once Grecian Air Minister to Paris , and Mr. Austen Parker .

Stares THE week-end dances at the Sleepy Hollow Country Club had been congealing early in the evening , under the frosty glances of a fringe of conservative dowagers ranged about the edges of the floor . They brought a powerful battery of lorgnettes to bear on the poor youngsters who ventured to disport themselves in the measures of the Charleston , or other late dances . Under this relentless scrutiny , the younger set faltered . Groups detached themselves , tumbled into motors outside , and made away to road houses , where vision and supervision were less high-powered . However , surrender was not to be eternal . A bright young lady completely routed the frigid elders by means of a simple stratagem . She and five companions appeared late for the dance equipped with field glasses , and as they moved about , focussed the glasses over their partners ' shoulders on the relentlessly staring fringe . After the third , or fourth dance , the elders wilted . They withdrew discreetly , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?
