The crew of the University of Washington was rowing against Princeton . They had arrived from the West Coast a week before to perfect their technic and between spells of rowing their large shapes had been seen posing about the town in sweaters adorned with little oars-a crew of giants . Two of them were six feet five inches high ; their average height was six feet three ; even the coxswain was a big man . This display of brawn had caused some apprehension in the minds of Princeton undergraduates and now as the two shells slipped over a panel of golden water , glazed with sunset , it was apparent that this apprehension was not unfounded .

At the mile the men of Princeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finish , six lengths .
