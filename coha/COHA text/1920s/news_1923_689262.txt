txt Governor General Wood has given out for publication his message to the Legislature In February last , which - the Legislature suppressed . The message dealt largely with the affairs of the Philippine National Bank , showing It to be in a very unsound condition . Only one Filipino newspaper , La - Vanguardia , publishes General Wood 's sup- pressed message , most of the others being silenced by Quezon . The Philippines Herald , Quezon 's personal organ , has an . eight-column head , " Is giving out of bank report criminal ? " Then it cites articles of the penal code providing punishment for public officers publishing governmental Papers wrongfully . It explains The Herald 's non-publication of the message on the ground that it must consult an attorney " on the question of whether or not such publication would , make this paper a party to any criminal act . " The Herald also prints the following item : " Prominent members of the Legis ' lature view the present agitation - Concerning the affairs of the Philippine National - Bank as something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department secretaries . " One " lawmaker " ( presumably Quezon ) is quoted as follows : " This agitation involves , not the political liberties already attained , but the economic life of the country , which is exposed to imminent danger of death by " the concerted action evidently designed , to destroy the credit and existence of the Philippine National Bank . " El Debate does not contain a single line on the message , but reprints an interview with ex-Manager Wilson of la ... April , wherein Wilson said : " No financial enterprise can live with the obstacles and interventions of the Governor General . " Quotes Experts ' Reports . The message , as given out to the press , does not contain in full the HaskinsSells report which accompanied the message when it was submitted to the Legislature . This report , which is partly quoted in the Wright-Martin report accompanying the message , directly involves ex-Mayor Fernandez in some questionable loans made by the bank . Its publication would probably kill the chances of Fernandez for election to the Senate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not divulge it in order not to be accused of local partisanship . The message , as given out , covers forty-two legal cap sheets . The most sensational portion is the WrightMartin report , the summarizing of the Haskins-Sells report and remarks on revaluing the bank 's assets . The Haskins-Sells report is qouted : " Our examination thus far reveals the fact that the bank operated during almost the entire period of its existence , Prior . to the appointment of Wilson as manager , in ' violation of every principle which prudence , intelligence and even honesty could dictate . " - It also quotes . from a report by Robert L. Herrick , New York banking authority , who ' recently came here at General Wood 's request to make a careful investigation of the , Government finances . Herrick reported : " This bank , I ' think , should be liquidated . If it is made strong again by putting Government money in , it will become weak again as a result of injudicious losses . I do not believe it possihie% to-run it under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . This is not because I particularly distrust Philippine management , for I assume that exactly the same thing would take place . in the United States if we started a Government bank . Unavoidably , with Government management and more- or less political influence ; or indifference , or lack of " competence op the ? Part . of a manager appointed by the Government , such a bank would absorb all the dead loans of the surrounding country , and other banks would do their best to help such - absorption by leading their unsatisfactory customers right ... over to the door of the new bank . Such a thing would happen all over the world , - and surely it must happen - in the =Philippines . " With regard- to ,  - -  - . reStoPlctilig its func- tions and then keeping it alive , I believe the answer is that all the good it could do with restricted functions can be accomplished in some other way . and Mat it would be difficult to keep it on a restricted basis , and it is much safer to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed in financial circles that General Wood will place the liquidating functions of the bank under a separate cori and also organize a separate agricultural bank .
