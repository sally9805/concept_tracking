Seagulls poised and wheeling in the hot blue sky above the Indian Ocean espied , last week , a long , low , incredibly slender ship , darting with splendid speed toward Aden , the Red Sea , Suez . A literate seagull might have spelled out upon the vessel 's spume flecked prow the name H. M. S. Enterprise . Aboard and often on the bridge was a young man who is called by his Royal family simply " David . " As he paced the bridge , engines of 80,000 horsepower thrust the frail 7,600-ton cruiser across the placid Indian Ocean at automobile speed : 40 m.p.h . Only a seaplane could have sped faster , yet the distance of 6,000 miles seemed illimitable , mocking . Perhaps the young man remembered Kipling 's words : <P> The Injun Ocean sets an ' smiles <P> So sof , so bright , so bloomin ' blue ! <P> There are n't a wave for miles an ' miles , <P> Excep ' the jiggle from the screw . <P> Last week the " jiggle " was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's short , rakishly tilted funnels spewed enough smoke and steam at roaring forced draft to perceptibly darken the " blue . " Behind lay British East Africa and the small , busy port of Dar-Es-Saalam , where Edward of Wales had taken ship . Ahead , beyond the Red Sea , beyond the Mediterranean , beyond Europe and the Channel lay the beloved Sovereign of an Empire . Radio flashes told that pleurisy had been followed by pneumonia , complicated by Bright 's disease . <P> At so grave an hour the young bachelor who may some day choose to call himself " King David " * might properly have pondered what his future is to be . Not much longer will the Empire rest content that he is without wife or heir . One may , with propriety , assume that last week the thoughts of David of Windsor turned repeatedly upon Lady Anne Maud Wellesley , 18 , dark eyed and blooming daughter of the Marquis Douro , direct descendant of the great Duke of Wellington . <P> Lady Anne is convalescing from pneumonia . Reports of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code to Edward of Wales throughout the course of his Afric Good Will Tour ( TIME , Sept. 17 et seq . ) . Naturally the Marquis Douro continued , last week , his refusal either to confirm or to deny . But the fact of H. R. H. 's solicitude for Lady Anne was not disputed . <P> Code radio flashes from London to the plunging , speeding Enterprise told David of Windsor more than any correspondent knew about George V 's condition . In England censorship of the official medical bulletins by Home Secretary Sir William Joynson-Hicks grew so drastic that prominent folk even tried to pry the truth out of Sir William 's son Lancelot , previously a pallid nonentity . One day after chatting with his tall , correct , frock-coated father , Lancelot Joynson-Hicks said positively : " There is no doubt that the King is on the mend . "
