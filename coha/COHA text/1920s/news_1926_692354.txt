txt The Joint Conference of anthracite operators and miners broke up this evening without reaching an agreement . The miners adhered to tia:ir proposal of last week , which was , in effect , voluntary arbitration . The operators continued in their demand rfor " c &npulsory; arbitration insisting that the miners agree in advance to bind themselves to accept the finings of an arbi ' tration commission . After the adjournment of the conference sine die , President John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers , in a statement , declared that this plan would have made possible , for the first time in the history of the industry , the production of the records and the facts of the industry . " The plan provides for the maximum of moral persuasion in the industry and only ' stopped short of actual physical compulsion upon the mine workers , " he said . " Fuither we can not go . We can not now and will not later accept compulsory arbitration . " Views of Opposing Spokesmen . The union leader asserted that the . hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become a lockout on the part of the anthracite operating interests . " He charged that through the starvation of the miners ' families the operators hoped to force the union men to agree on a lowering of wages through arbitration . Major W. M. Inglis , Chairman of the Operators ' Negotiating Committee , blamed President Lewis for the failure to reach an agreement , declaring that the record showed that the union leader " not only rejects arbitration , he rejects everything . " " Scores of earnest men devoted weeks to devising a formula to meet Mr. Lewis 's demands , " said Major Inglis , " only to encounter the same objections on Mr. Lewis 's part to anything that limits his power to bring about deadlocks , call strikes and then take the position that they shall be ended only on his own terms , without regard to reason and justice . " No immediate question of wages or employment remains at issue . " he added . " We are faced , only by the blind determination of Mr. Lewis to impose his will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . " Direct Appeal to Miners Expected . It is expected from what Major Inglis said that the operators will now place their side of the case before the mine workers in the hard coal region with the hope that the latter will bring pressure to bear upon their leaders for a settlement Of the strike on the terms proposed by the mine owners . The miners and operators ' representatives are still far apart , but they have never been closer together since July 9 , , when the negotiations began at Atlantic City . This paradoxical situation is caused by the willingness of the union leaders to accept the maximum of moral persuasion in so far as a report by the proposed fact-finding commission is concerned . They all but bind themselves in advance to accept the findings of the commission . To take the final step , they say , would bind them to compulsory arbitration . Their plan is for a fact-finding commission appointed by Charles E. Hughes , Governor Pinchet and Secretary of Labor Davis . to report to_the the Conciliation Board of three Miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report as promptly as possible . Pledge to Abide by Arbitration Seen . That the Miners virtually promise to abide by the Arbitration Commission 's report , put into shape by the Conciliation Board , is the interpretation placed here by observers , not operators , upon the Statement of Mr. Lewis that his plan is for - " the maximum of moral Persuasion in tat industry  --  short of actual physical compulsion . " The issue of the strike has now narrowed down to voluntary arbitration versus compulsory arbitration . This question settled , the matter of wages , check-off and other problems could easily be adjusted . All efforts of disinterested parties to end the controversy will nOw resolve themselves to obtaining an adjustment Of the point of view of each side on " the maaltratat of moral compulsion , " as suggested by the union , and an agreement in advance that both sides will accept the findings of a third party , ae proposed by the operators . The joint conference was brought to an end at 7 o'clock tonight , afte a teasicia which began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconded by the Operators . Statement-of President Lewis . Following the break , Mr. LevAls dictated the following statement to the newspapers : The conference adjourned without day on motion of the operators . Under the circumstances , the Mine workers could not but accept their decision to remain no longer in conference . The mine workers ' representative 's called this conference in the hope that etthe basis Of agreement could be reached . The plan of Mr. E. J. Lynett , publisher of The Scranton Times , suggested , in effect , an ex -- 'tension rot five years of the wages and conditions of employment which existed prior to Sept. 1 . The mine workers accepted the spirit and purpose of the Lynett plan and the operators refused to do so unless the mine workers accepted also periodic and continuous arbitration in the industry . Ill further effort to_the arrive a a settlement , the mine workers suggested the acceptance of the Lynett plan for a two-year period . This also , the operators refused . " Maximum of Moral Persuasion . " Each of the several proposals of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , retplirediiedeptanee Of ' the pilueiple of arbitration as a condition precedent to the making of a wage agreement for any length of time . The mine workers offered last week a most comprehensive and constructive plan Of settlement which provided fer a five-year agreement , a greater degree of cooperation in the industry and the creation of ' a fact-finding commission , with eminent personnel , to assist the Anthracite Board of Conciliation at any time that a revision of the agreement was asked by either side . This arrangement would have made possible for the first time in the history of the industry the production of the records and the facts of the industry . The plat provide es for the maximum of moral persuasion in the industry , and only stopped short of actual physical compulsion upon the Mite workers . Further we can not go . We can not now and will not later accept compulsory arbitration . We do not propose to barter away for a mess of pottage the inhetent and individual rights of the anthracite mine averkert . Declares Lookout Now Exists . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer a strike . It , has betame a lockout oh the part of the anthracite operating interests . One hundred and fifty eight thousand men in the industry , through their representatives , have signified their willingness to return to Work under conditions substantially at be ? tore , but the anthracite Operators demand that before the mine workers can do so they shall first agree that their wages may be lowered threugh the instrumentality of arbitration . This it a price we canna and Will not pay and for this reason the Operators proposed to keep their Mintz cabbed ufttil b. population is starved . It lb as truly a lockout as ever ex Wed in the history of American industry . Wie regret the breaking up of the conference . We are net responsible for its disintegration . V. I deplore the failure to agree , but he light of reason ditclaim respensmility . Our people will resist the coercive policies of the anthracite operators until the tithe ( betties when . in the light of reason , an honorable agreement can be made . only to encounter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part to anything-that Malts Wit:ewer to bring about dead-. locks , call strikes and then take the petition that they shall be ended only on his own terms , without regard to reason or justice . No immediate question of wages or employment remains at issue . We are faced only by the blind determination of Mr. Lewis to . impose his ? will upon us , our employes and the people of this country . We are quite willing to be judged by the record of what we have stood for , the proposals we have made . This record is open to the public . We are willing that any fair-tniaded Man judge for himself , and then bay whether our course is just and reasonable . We shall submit these proposals to our employes and to the people Of the anthracite region and ask them alto to judge of the fairness of our course . We do not ask any one to accept our view of the merits of the case . We do ask that the proposals offered to_the end the " strike and prevent others be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operators . At the meeting this afterhobn , the Operators Offered two prOPbtalt . The first was for a five-year agreement on terms to be agreed upon . Each party would have the right , once a year , to ask the Conciliation Board for revision of Wages . The board would ask Charles E. Hughes to appoint a commission of Wee to Investigate the Meta and Make recommendations to be incorporated in a contract by the Conciliation Board . In case of disagreement on the recommendations , either party would have the right . appeal to Mr. Hughes . Theteapbn Mr. Hughes " than make a finding ' which Shall be accepted by both parties and. , thall be written into the cbrittaate " The plan was voted dOwn by the Miners . The operator 's then made another suggestion . They inbred that Mining be resumed immediately on the terms of ' the contract which expired last September , these COnditions to continue until March 31 , 1927 . Meanwhile the Conciliation Board Of three miners , three operator* and an umpire , should draw up a contract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposal to provide for an immediate resumption at the wages of the old contract , these to continue until ' March 30 , 1923 . Meanwhile the Conciliation Board , without the umpire , should draw up the terms oe a contract until Aug. 31 , 1930 . . . ' The important change suggested by the miners web the exclusion Of the umpire , which would mean that the qotaract would have to be mutually agreed upon by three ininere and three operators . The Millet also added a demand for the cheek-off . Clash en Arbitration Issue . " Your proposal destroys the spirit and intent of our motiOn , " said George Hadesty of the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company . " You refused to provide against suspensions during the term oathe agreement . you , again make a demand for the check-off which we have told you repeatedly we can not grant . " The miners voted for the amendment and the operators against it . The motion was lost on a tie vote . On the original proposal , Mr. Lewis said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-year contract with proviso : fat fixing the wage scale by - arbitiallipb. thereafter .

" The operators voted . aye and the miners nay , and the second : of the owners ' proposals Was lest . Lewis Asks Full Conference of Sixty .. Mr. Lewis then reeved that the entire controversy be placed before the Joint Scale Committee Of about sixty minors Mid operators in the hope that an agreement might be reached . He said that in 1916 the recalling of the Joint Conference resulted in an agreement . He said the motion was'made in good faith and in the hope that some good might be accomplished . Major Inglis opposed the motion , saying the resolution adopted at At= lantic City on , Yuly 9 reel-red all matter 's of the Joint Subeetainittee Of sat miners and six operators . There was no provision at in 1916 , he said , for " a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost by the Objecti011 Of the operators . Andrew Fine of the Hudson Coal Company then said in view " of the conditions as ahoy are and the apparent-impossibility a ? f coming to an agreementat this time , I move we adjourn sine die to ' meet at the call of the chair , of his own initiative or at the request of either side . " The motion was seconded by Major Inglis and adopted unanimously . That ended the meeting . secretary James A. Gorman removed an American flag from the room . It had been taken into the session by Chairman Alvan Markle , who hoped it would appeal to the patriotism of the two sides and would spur them on to an agreement . Inglis 's Statement for , Operators . In behalf of the operators , Major Inglis made the following statement : The record of today 's meeting tPtitite for itself anti . leaves Very little for us to say . From this Tee , ord , it appears that Mr. Lewis not only rejects arbitration , he rejects everything . He rejects a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old wages until next year . He rejects a. prepeard that our differencea be referred to the Board of Conciliartion with an appeal , if necessary , to the lion , Charles Evans Hughes . Following this , with wages fixed until the end of March , 1927 , he rejects our proposal that the Boatel of Conciliation , functioning as it has for twenty-three years , shall undertaKe to decide the terms of a contract . Mr. Lewis asserts that there will be no necessity for a wage adjustment in the next five years , but he will not permit even a man like Justice Hughes to make a finding on this subject , if there Is a disagreement in negotiations . Not only our own Ingenuity , but the thought of scores of earnest men have been devoted in recent weeks to devising some formula that would meet NI . Lewis 's demand .
