txt Humble Oil &; Refining is probably the most interesting company in the Southwest today . That is , it is capable of more interesting complications and appears to hare more interesting opportunities . In point of properties and general importance it is at least fifth in rank among the large companies of the southern Mid-continent ( including Gulf coast . ) Until eighteen months ago it was a local company 1 which was growing rapidly and sturdily , with large nil production in the Coastal fields , and with good properties in the North Texas fields . It also had a small and comparatively unimportant refinery at San Antonio , Texas . ! Total value of its properties at this time was approximately $17,000,000. iThis being the sum agreed upon at the time of its deal with S. 0 . of N. J. ) .

The latter , one of the most vigirous of all the Standard Oil branches , has by far the largest refinery in Louisiana lat Baton Rouge ) . a great plant , in which is used much Mexican crude as well as large quantities of Mid-Continent light oils . The Louisiana company is today probably the largest producer of crude oil in the North Louisiana light ! oil fields , and owns , and has owned for years the southern end of the transcontinental system of pipes which swings from southeast Louisiana up through the Mid-Continent and thence in a vast curve to New York City . In Oklahoma and Karsas. the New Jersey company is also represented by strong subsidiaries , such as the Oklahoma Pipe Line Co .. and the Carter Oil company , a producing company . But in Texas , the New Jersey company has been most conspicuously absent for many years , due to the ouster suits of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Refining Co. it was in a manner formally reentering a country from which it had been an exile . Its partnership with the " Humble crowd " is a tribute to the high standing of the officials of that company as business men and citizens of Texas , for there is no doubt that a part of the consideration which influenced Standard Oil of New Jersey to buy into the Humble Co. was the desire to re-enter Texas under the best auspices . A FLEAstNG ( ' oMHINATIoN OF MEN The Humble company is the result of the joint effort of several men , Messrs . Sterling . Farish , Blaffer , Fondren , Weiss. etc .. who are all of one type , the modern Southern business man . and were born and reared in the country in which they have built their company . A partnership with such men was undoubtedly good politics for a great corporation which knows that even yet in Texas there are some live embers of an ancient animosity . In the comparatively short time since the New Jersey company bought into Humble Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the treasury of the company , much of which has been expended in building pipe lines , buying oil , erecting a large refinery on the Gulf coast , and in oil development work . , So that it is evident the New Jersey company not only wanted a politic partnership in Texas ? it also desired a big part in the Texas oil industry . Humble Oil X Refining has already moved strongly forward in line with these instructions . By building a pipe line from the Coast ( below Houston ) to Ranger . Texas , it has supplied another southern outlet for the general transcontinental pipe system i with both the southern branches controlled by Standard Oil of New Jersey . ) It almost immediately took the lead as a buyer and transporter in the Coastal oil fields , with far-reaching and most important consequences to that territory . It has become an important factor in the market for North Central Texas Light oils , and is exerting greater influence upon the North Texas fields . Its large refinery , now building on the Coast below Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields , from the coastal heavy oil fields and from Mexico . With the Humble in Texas , and the Standard Oil of Louisiana in Louisiana , the New Jersey company is now the dominant factor in the southern Mid-Continent ( including Gulf Coast . ) STIMULATING EFFECT 01 ' STANDARD on , The quick growth of Humble 's power under the alliance with the New Jersey corporation was particularly shown on the Gulf coast . These fields , which for years have produced with remarkable regularity 60,000 to 80,000 barrels of oil daily , were during these years the most uncertain sphere of business in the Southwest . The Coastal crude although valuable for lubricants and easily refined , usually sold on a fuel oil basis . and the prices , always very low in comparison with those of the northern Mid-Continent fields . fluctuated as erratically as the weather . There was much evidence at times that the two or three buyers which controlled the situation Amply ran prices up and down at will , regardless of general conditions , with the result that the oil producer there properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deal with Standard Oil the Humble company immediately began buying Coastal crude for Standard Oil of New Jersey and also on its own account , and in a few months time had run up the price 200% or to about $3.00 per barrel , and has since held it firm at that point . thus giving the Gulf coast producers for the first time prices commensurate with the intrinsic value of their commodity . rossintiarrtus OF LIGHT OILS One of the momentous possibilities of Humble Oil &; Refining is what it might do in the north Central light oil fields . For months now its pipe line from the Texas deep sands has been crowded to capacity with Ranger crude , going to Texas City , and thence by ships to Standard Oil Refineries along the Atlantic Coast . Ranger crude is more valuable than ninny of the other light oils ( because of its cylinder stocks . ) The residue easily sells for a dollar a barrel more than the crude itself . Prairie Oil &; Gas Co. is now the dominant influence , or price maker , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made for Ranger crude , for shipment through the Humble pipes , by buyers who are paying more than the Prairie quotation . Another step , and the Humble would he naming the price for this territory . The Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey ' now owns a majority of the issued capital stuck of the Humble Co. and theoretically is in full control ( unless there are private contracts with the old stockholders to the contrary , ) but the management is left absolutely to the group of men who were in charge of the company before the combination . st-rivms . IN NEW BUILDING Company ' : progress since Standard Oil bought in has been chiefly in the matter of pipe lines , buying oil , building refinery , etc . The main pipe is an 8-inch to Ranger , with laterals ramifying over the Entire Texas deep sands , from Sipe Springs , Rising Star , Desdemona , in the south end of the general district to Breckenridge , etc. in Stephens county . On the Gulf Coast the company has built pipes into West Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business in crude oil may be had from the fact that the ocean shipments from Texas City sometimes run more than a million barrels a month . The refinery at Texas City is now being completed to run 10,000 or 12,000 barrels of oil daily . The original plans are said to have been for a much larger plant and it is believed that construction work will go on perhaps for years . As now being finished the Texas City plant will be one of the most complete refineries of its size in the United States . The investment in this plant alone will probably total more than ten million dollars by the first of 1921 . HAIL " PROM:MON FIGURES The company 's oil production ranges between 20,000 and 30,000 barrels daily . Most of this is in Texas , where the company is now the third largest producer . During the second quarter of the year , for instance , it produced in Texas 1.866,521 barrels of oil , or approximately 21,000 barrels daily , valued at $5,715,223 . These totals were exceeded only by the Texas company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the company has approximately 3,000 barrels daily production . of which six or seven hundred barrels are old and well settled and the remainder new oil in the Hewitt pool . The company has been doing some preliminary work in North Louisiana , and will probably soon be producing oil there . An itemization of the company 's oil production is approximately as follows : Gulf Coast . approximately 12,000 bbls. daily Za low aver . ) Texas Deep Sands 4,500 bbls . North Texas Healdton . Oklahoma Hewitt , Oklahoma deeply into the Ranger or North Central Texas District . Humble Oil ? Refining so far has got poor results from its extensive and expensive development work there . Right now this is a sore spot with the company . But with the oil that it has bought , the profits on-its pipeage , etc. , it is a question whether Humble will in the end lose much money in the Deep sands . The company has a large quantity of oil in storage in Texas , approximately , 5,500,000 barrels . Much of this oil is Coastal crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in value as a result of the higher quotations for Texas oils . ( Such values are not realized until the oil is sold or used and might decline with a decline in the prices of oils . ) HISTORY OF TM : comesNv Humble Oil Refining by the way has been one of the most profitable investments in the Mid-continent for its original stockholders , especially when these stockholders count hack to the old Humble Oil company which wa .. the basis of the present corporation . The old Humble Oil company ' was a $300.000 incorporation in which It . S. Sterling was the leading spirit . In 1916 this company was the main component of a merger of three or four small but vigorous Texas oil interests . These included the Blaffer &; Farish , the W. W. Fondren and the Prather &; Weiss interests . The merger took practically the name of the old company . The new corporation . Humble Oil &; Refining Co. was organized with $4,100,000 capital . The stockholders in the old Humble Oil company received seven shares ; of stock in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . By 1919 the company 's proper . ties had increased in value to such a point , that , as said . at the time of the deal with the Standard Oil company of New Jersey an appraisement of $17,000,000 was placed upon them . The Standard consequently placed in the treasury of the company $17,000,000 cash . The capital stock of the company was doubled . that is. increased to $8,200,000 and the new stock given to the New Jersey company in return for its $17,000.000 . In October , 1919 , the capital of the company was itcreased to approximately 225.000,000 , the stockholders being given the right to subscribe to approximately 125r* , of their holdings at par and to 75 " of their holdings at $250 per share . The old or local stockholders took all of their par rights but pooled the class " B " or $250 share rights and sold them to the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey for 645 a share . The present selling price of a share of Humble Oil &; Refining is about $250 . A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Humble Oil company if he were to close out his holdings in the present company today at the above price , would have received net and exclusive of dividends , approximately $3,375 for each $100 that Ile put into the Humble Oil company .
