The Cabinet provisionally assembled , last fortnight , under General John Metaxas ( Royalist ) , was hastily supplanted , last week , by one more Coalition Government under veteran Prime Minister Alexander Zaimis . <P> Thus ended the most recent " Venizelos Crisis " ( TIME , June 4 ) , dramatically precipitated by the sudden emergence from retirement of famed Eleutheris Venizelos , mighty Elder Statesman .
