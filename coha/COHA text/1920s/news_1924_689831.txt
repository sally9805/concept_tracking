Mr. Fall did not bear out the reports that he is an ill and broken man . It was apparent that he was worried and , as the doctors who examined him expressed it . " in an anxiety state . " Otherwise he looked the same stern-faced person so well known in official and political circles of Washington . Accompanied by Levi Cooke , his counae , Mr. Fall left the home of Colonel J. W.

Sinclair . at 9:30 o'clock this morning and was ready to appear when the committee convened in the Democratic caucus room in the Senate office building ball an hour later .

Just before the committee was called to order Senators Lenroot and Walsh were in conference . Mr. Walsh , with the records of previous hearings and other data piled on his desk , was ready to cross-examine Mr. FalL A report had gained circulation that Mr. Fall would talk freely and would tell all he knew , but Just the opposite happened .  --  " Air . Fall . " said Senator Walsh , " the committee is ready to hear any statement you may desire to make .

Senate Joint Resolution 54. attempting to deal with the leases of the Mammoth Oil Company ; that that resolution was referred to this committee , and in due course the Senate discharged this committee , as of Jan. 24 , 1924 , and the Senate thereafter , on Jan. 31. 1924 , agreed to that - resolution and completed its consideration thereof , the resolution being so amended as to deal in the Senate , in a plenary way , with the leases upon naval oil reserves which were before this committee under Senate Resolution 282 and Senate Resolution 294 , and that this committee has no further authority to deal with Senate Joint Resolution 54 , since it has been discharged by II e Senate and the Senate itself has finally acted upon the resolution . I decline to answer on the further ground that Senate Joint Resolution G4 , as passed unanimously by the Senate , recites that it appears , from evidence taken by this committee . that certain lease of naval reserve No. 3 , in the State of Wyoming . bearing date April 7. 1922. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through myself .

Fall . Secretary of the Interior , and Edwin , Denby , Secretary of the Navy , as lessor , were executed under circumstances indicating fraud and corruption ; said leases were entered into without authority on the part of the officers purporting to act in the execution of the same for the United States . and in violation of the laws of Congress , and that in the same resolution it is resolved that the President of the United States be authorized and directed immediately to cause suit to be instituted and prosecuted for the annulment and cancellation of the leases , and to prosecute such other actions and proceedings , civil and criminal . as may be warranted by the facts in relation to the making of said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appoint special counsel to have charge and control of the prosecution of such litigation , and I decline to answer on the grounds that my answer may tend to incriminate me . In declining to answer and in stating these reasons I wish to express full respect for the committee and for the Senate , but to remind the committee that on Oct. 23 and 24 , last . while this committee was sitting in recess of Congress and dealing with Senate Resolution 282 and Senate Resolution 294 , I appeared before the committee and discussed at length the negotiations of the lease , including the lease of April 25. 1922. signed by Edwin C. Finney . Acting Secretary of the Interior , and Edwin Denby . Secretary of the Navy , relating to construction of oil tanks at Pearl Harbor .

Fan to Reappear Tuesday . When Mr. Fall concluded the comImittee went into executive session , in which Silas H. Strawn of Chicago of counsel appointed by President Coolidge to prosecute any court actions growing out of the investigation , took part .. While the committee was in conference behind closed doors Mr. Fall walked to the office of Senator Elkins of West Virginia , where he remained until the . . rte committee adjourned . Just before he left he was notified to appear again at 10 o'clock Tuesday morning , when the committee will make known its decision regarding ' the former Secretary 's refusal to testify . The committee will seek to meet Mr. Fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new resolution which will supersede the one under which the proceedings arc now being conducted and will have the effect , in the opinion of Senators Lenroot and Walsh . of starting the investigation all over again . The committee 's attitude is indicated in the following motion by Senator Walsh , which was passed unanimously just before the executive session was adjourned : On Feb. 5 , 1922 , the Senate enopted Senate Resolution 434 , wincli " authorized this committee to proceed , as it has proceeded , under SenateResolution 282 and Senate Resolution 294 , which by the expressed terms of Senate Resolution 434 were continued in full force and effect until the end of the Sixty-eighth Congress : authorized the committee " to sit during the sessions or the recesses of the Senate and , after the expiration of the present ( Sixty-seventh ) Congress , until the assembling of the Sixty-eighth Congress , and until otherwise ordered by the Senate . " While this resolution would clearly seem to warrant the proceeding heretofore had since the adjournment of the Sixty-seventh Congress , our right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statement read by him to the committee this morning , I move that when the committee adjourns it adjourns to meet at 10 o'clock Tuesday morning , Feb. 5 , 1924 , and that the committee present to the Senate on Monday next , Feb. 4 , and ask the immediate adoption of a resolution in substance identical with Se.nate Resolution 282 , and Senate Resolution 294 ( Sixty-seventh ConKress , in order that the question raised by the statement of Mr. Fall may be eliminated . Smitten ; Study the Law . Senators Walsh and Lenroot are going carefully over the laws which govern the procedure in the Government investigations and cover cases where witnesses refuse to testify before Congressional committees . Section 102 of the Revised Statutes provides that " whenever a witness summoned as mentioned in Section 102 fails to testify and the facts arc reported to either House . the President of the Senate , or the Speaker of the House , as the case may be . shall certify the fact , under seal of the Senate or the House , to the District Attorney for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring the matter before the Grand Jury for their action . " Section 959 provides that " no testimony given by a witness before either House or before any committee of either House of Congress shall be used as evidence in any criminal proceedings against him in any case , except in the prosecution for perjury committed in giving such testimony : but an official paper or record produced by him is not within the said privilege . " In view of Mr. Fall 's refusal to testify there was some talk in the Senate cloakrooms that . if necessary to get his story , the House might be asked to vote impeachment proceedings as a last resort . Under the law a Cabinet officer can be impeached after resigning his post . If convicted under such proceeding , Mr. Fall would lose his citizenship , his right to hold office and to vote . The right to bring such proceedings -O - against an official who had retired from office was determined in the case of William W.
