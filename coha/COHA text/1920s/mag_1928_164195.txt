When Chairman Work of the Republican National Committee said that the Hoover campaign would be conducted on a budget of less than $3,000.000 ( TIME , July 9 ) , there was a general raising of eyebrows among political commentators , a general lowering of mouth-corners by local G. 0 . P. bosses . Some $5,300,000 was recorded in the Harding-Coolidge campaign and more than $3,000,000 in the Coolidge-Dawes . This year , Chairman Work said , " We have candidates who will not need so large a sum . " It sounded admirable , but a revised estimate was not unexpected . <P> Last week , the Democracy 's chairman of finance , Banker Herbert H. Lehman of Manhattan , frankly announced that no limit would be placed upon the size or volume of contributions to the Smith campaign . The G. 0 . P. 's Treasurer , Banker Joseph R. Nutt of Cleveland , immediately issued a revision of Chairman Work 's $3,000,000 estimate . He mentioned $4,000,000 as a possible total and removed all idea of a limit to G. 0 . P. contributions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous G. O. P. campaigns and said : " We have a harder fight on our hands this time . " <P> It was another way of saying that the Republicans now realize that the Democrats have Big Money behind them this year . <P> In recent state primaries and elections , $1 per vote has been cheap indeed for the returns obtained . The unsuccessful campaign of George Wharton Pepper in Pennsylvania cost $3.69 per vote in 1926 . The same year , in the same State , William B. Wilson spent 65c per vote for a Senate nomination for which he had no opposition . <P> About 30 million votes will be cast in the election this November . It is undoubtedly true that it is easier and cheaper to get out the vote in Presidential elections than in Senatorial . But if the current cost of Senate votes is no higher than $1 each , Presidential votes will have to be more than twice as easy and cheap if the major parties are to spend less than $15,000,000 between them . <P> And no matter how diligent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total actually spent will be reported to Congress . Vast wads of local money , to be spent not literally in buying votes but in paying precinct " workers " to round up their families and friends , pass from , unnamed donors to taciturn precinct bosses . This money is meant , usually , to ensure the election of local candidates . The national candidates benefit simultaneously but the money does not show on their books . <P> Concerning G. 0 . P. contributions , Treasurer Nutt also made this curious statement : " Another question concerns where it comes from . I feel sure that Chairman Hubert Work will not accept any improper vouchers . . . . No subscription has been requested or accepted where any reasonable question could be rightfully raised as to the donor or the amount of the subscription . " <P> The Nutt plan for raising perhaps $4,000,000 was not elaborate . Mr. Nutt outlined it as follows : <P> " There will be two divisions for solicitation , namely ( a ) to solicit the small donors ( b ) to solicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
