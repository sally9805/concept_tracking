Ox MY WAY-Art Young-Liveright ( $4 ) . <P> <P> Cartoonist Art Young of Wisconsin , Chicago , Manhattan , Paris and Bethel , Conn. , drew some-of-the-first daily political cartoons and the first colored news supplements in the U. S. , for the oldtime Chicago Inter-Ocean . <P> He is still alive- &-kicking-alive; enough to have gained and retained fame as a grand exalted past master of cartooning . His kicking is what has kept him from enjoying the mass reputation of men like Ding . Briggs , Bud Fisher . Something in Art Young resents contracts , syndication and orders as to what ideas he shall draw . He has free-lanced for 35 years in Life , Puck , Judge , Metropolitan and many another magazine , past and present , rather than earn the " big money " that Arthur Brisbane once told him he deserved as a syndicate artist . It was natural , perhaps . that just after giving this advice , Editor Brisbane haggled with Mr. Young over prices . But it helps explain why Young was at his happiest contributing without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation , The Masses . He was best paid when contributing ( " Trees at Night " ) to that weekly of vast circulation and relatively " reactionary " mentality , The Saturday Evening Post . <P> Capitalism , the profit system , bothers Mr. Young a good deal . He thinks society should be communal , that work should be held noble and money-getting base . These ideas , and his trial ( at which he slept ) for sedition with other Masses editors during the War , and his eccentricities , such as lying nakedly asprawl on his hill for sunbaths , make his Connecticut neighbors view " that c'toonist " with some alarm . They are reassured , though somewhat puzzled by his deep vein of quizzical , kindly humor . His life has been most unconventional , they feel , but they know it has been rich and gentle . <P> By the simple process of keeping a reminiscent journal for six months , " that c'toonist " has told his neighbors , who for him include all mankind , how life has been with him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read , heard , thought . <P> Among other things , he saw Greenwich Village before the realtors " improved " it . He attended the joyous nocturnal picnic given on top of the Washington Square arch by a beautiful girl called Woe . <P> He saw all the Presidents from Cleveland on and talked with several ; also Senators , famed preachers , Mark Twain , P. T. Barnum and many another less famed but , to him , equally important . <P> He read Thoreau , Emerson and Whitman , Hugo , Dumas and Shakespeare . He remembers what he reads and lives by a lot of it . His god is one of Life and Laughter who belongs to no organized church . <P> He heard all there was to hear , in Paris , about Gustave Dore , the enormously popular and prolific illustrator who most influenced his own art . He reached Paris six years too late ( 1889 ) to see Dore . Bouguereau was one of his teachers . <P> He has heard Bill Nye tell stories and Frank Harris converse . Eugene Debs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitcomb Riley , O. Henry , Helen Keller and numerous newsboys , janitors , cabbies , children were or are among his acquaintances .
