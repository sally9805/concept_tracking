Harding does not appear in one or more windows . The house in the business section is the home of Tho Marion Star , of which Senator Harding is editor , publisher and part owner . The other is a detached , green-painted , nine-room dwelling situated on Mount Vernon Avenue and rather less pretentious than a majority of the homes of that residential thoroughfare , This dwelling would attract attention because of a front porch big enough to blanket it and make the house look a mere incident , even if it was not known to be the home of Senator Harding . This porch runs parallel with the entire front of the house and part way with one side .
