Last week a distinguished looking gentleman boarded the liner Orcoma at Liverpool . He was carried on board in a wheelchair . <P> There were deep lines in his face , and because of neuritis he carried his left arm in a sling . He was accompanied by his wife , who is one of Europe 's most charming diplomatic hostesses , his daughter Diane , and his younger son , Lawrence . <P> He was British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Austen Chamberlain , convalescing from bronchial pneumonia . <P> With Sir Austen &; Family sailed a valet , a detective and one Anne Strachey ( Diane Chamberlain 's companion ) . They were en route for California and Canada , via the Panama Canal . <P> As the Orcoma paused at the Spanish harbor of Santander , Alfonso XIII , King of Spain , came aboard , exchanged greetings with the sick secretary who was barely able to rise from his bed chair .
