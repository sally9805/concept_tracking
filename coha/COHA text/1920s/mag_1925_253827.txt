With the thesis that " Uncle Sam Needs a Wife , " finding a thousand flaws in our man-made government , a woman wrote a book. * It was calculated to show how the feminine touch would set things right . One of the chapters was titled , " Wanted-A Female Moses . " Ida Clyde Clarke , the writer , found that women needed a leader-one chosen not by men , but by themselves-and proceeded likewise to state what , in her belief , constitutes the inadequacy of certain women leaders of today : <P> " Mrs. Catt has power and ability . <P> <P> She could perhaps be our Moses if she had patience and penetration . But she is impatient of the sluggishness of organized women to move toward any definite object , and she frets over their impotency . She is not able to forget that the General <P> Federation refused to endorse suffrage until 1913 . Mrs. Catt could point women 's way to world peace , because she is statesmanlike and clearheaded , but she lacks imagination and the magnetism that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind and not to the heart and the mind is slow to work when the heart is cold . Jane Addams sees a century ahead , and she sees a clear path to the light for which we are groping-but she sees but one path . If we wo n't take that path , she walks on alone and leaves us to wander along as best we can . " <P> " Mrs. Winter , for four years president of the General Federation of Women 's Clubs , seemed to have many ideal qualifications for the leadership of her particular group , but outside of that group women were not inclined to follow her . Alice Paul satisfies entirely the demands of her particular group of ultra-progressives , but her following is comparatively small . " <P> As for the group of women officeholders : " Whatever may be said of the several women who have been elected thus far , they have not been placed in office through the interest of or by the votes of women . " <P> Alice Robertson ( Representative from Oklahoma in the 67th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . " <P> Of Mrs. Mae E. Nolan ( Representative from California in the 67th and 63th Congresses ) , she says : " I heard some well-meaning and kind-hearted friends in California say they voted for her because they wanted to ' see her get the money ' that her husband would have received had he lived to fill his term in Congress . It was our good fortune that Mrs. Nolan did no violence to any of our cherished principles and we liked her . " <P> " Winifred Mason Huck , young and clever and ready to proclaim and stand for certain ideals that many of us applauded , served a fraction of a term in Congress because she was the daughter of a politician with a following-a following which she inherited at his death . Women neither selected nor elected her . "
