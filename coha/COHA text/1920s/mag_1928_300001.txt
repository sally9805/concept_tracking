JAY GOULD-Robert Irving Warshow-Greenberg ( $3.50 ) . <P> Once only , Jay Gould waited in the European anteroom of a Banker Rothschild . He had sent in his card . Presently , it was returned to him with a message . " Europe , " observed Banker-Baron Rothschild , " is not for sale . " <P> Europe thereby gained a unique distinction .

If he had known , he would not have cared . <P> It is a tale of triumph . Yet , most curiously , the odor of death hangs over the story of Jay Gould .
