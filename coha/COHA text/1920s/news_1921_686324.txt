txt " Warren Gamaliel Harding and Florence 41ing Harding left their Marion home tonight for four years/ residence in Waghington . The prayers and best ' wishes of their friends and neighbors go with them . " This is the kind of personal item that might well have appeared in the columns of The Marion Daily Star if the style were followed of paragraphs written by **26;187;TOOLONG Harding in , the early days when other Marionites moved away . Today these sentiments were echoed by one-third of the population of Marion , crowding around the famous front porch ' . of the ten-room green-painted house , which will be occupied tomorrow by a well-to-do dealer in building material . The front porch at 280 Mount Vernon Avenue has been surrounded by thousands of people from all parts of the country in the past eight months , but never has there been such-a scene of affecting simplicity as was enacted there this forenoon when 10,000 Marion friends and neighbors said " Good-bye " to the Hafdings . The genuineness and simple dignity of the ceremony that lasted less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now will be the centre of- another ceremonial of world-wide consequence . Shopworkers and storekeepers went to their work and children to school this morning the same as . on - other weekdays , but at 10 o'clock every factory , bank , store and school closed and ? all ages trooped out Church ? Street and down Mount Vernon Avenue . Three hours later all were back at work , while the President-elect and Mrs. Harding performed their last duties before leaving for Washington early this evening . An Affecting Farewell . It was an all-Marion crowd around the front porch this morning . People stood in spots ankle-deep in mud to show their loyalty and affection , which was symbolized in a silver plaque , formally presented to the President-elect  --  and his wife by the Rev. T. H. , pastor of Trinity Baptist Church , where the Hardings worship . The lively enthusiasm of the campaign Was kicking . There was a short cheer as the Hardings appeared on the porch , but that was all , despite the presence of hundreds of school children who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all were dry-eyed when Dr. , his shock of yellow hair greyed by long convalescence from a stroke of paralysis , raised his hand for silence , and . Mrs. Harding was among the first to reach for her handkerchief as the clergyman , with Mrs. holding his manuscript for him , read his speech of presentation . Mr. Harding , bareheaded , with his overcoat unbuttoned , stcod with his head bowed and half closed eyes . But when it came to his turn to acknowledge gMarion 's - gift , the President-elect had full command of himself and with shoulders thrown back spoke slowly in a clear yoke that reached the edges of the crowd . Mrs. Harding half turned from the crowd , as she stood a few feet away , her eyes filling as she bit her lips . She remained almost motionless until she stepped over to Mr. Harding 's elbow when he said : " I speak only the truth when I tell you that Mrs. Harding and I are going from you with a feeling of ? sorrow , with that unavoidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they leave the community in which they ' have developed and lived so long : ' Standing behind the Hardings on the front porch were a score of intimate friends and neighbors . There were men to whom the President-elect is " W. G. , " " Warn " and " Gov , " a nickname that has stuck since Mr. Harding was Lieutenant Governor of Ohio nearly twenty years ago . And to the President-elect these , business associates and companions of thirty years , as well as to . nearly every ' one remaining in Marion during the campaign , these men were known by such nicknames as " Dick . " " Jim " and " Gink. " - All these men have been told that they will be committing ' an unforgivable offense if they do not come to the White House often . Dr. MeAfee 's Tribute . In his presentation address in behalf of " Dick " and " Jim " and " Gink " and the rest of the Marionites Dr. said : " President-elect and Mrs. Warren G. Harding : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence in our midst . I. assure- you it is an - exalted privilege for me to voice on behalf of .. tbose gathered here , the most sacred bonds of friendship and the tenderest ties of af- fection . As we look back over the road which you and your esteemed helpmate have traveled , we have an abiding conviction that your lives and achievements will come with a thrill of the inspiration to the myriads of youthful folks as they swing out into life 's way to travel that Path which stretches out into the years before them and that this inspiration will fire them with an indomitable purpose which will not be denied . ' When the news was flashed from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from the lakes to the Gulf that you were chosen standard-bearer of one . of the great political parties , we laughed and romped like children at play . When the American nation broke the quiet and lifted the suspense of months by- a most overwhelming choice for the Presidency , which convinced opponents and silenced defamers , we were in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of play to the altars of prayer . from the place of exaltation- to wait in the precincts of humility . We then saw you as the outstanding . man of our generation , a man of love and unselfish friendships . " Some see the shadows of friendship , but follow only afar off , and can hear only the echoes of services , which they do not understand . But we shall walk together as friends in companionship , listening to the unfailing voice of friendship who sits in earth 's holy of holies , the divinest of all gifts except the unspeakable gift of God , Jesus Christ Friendship challenges earth 's most desirable things  --  popularity . beauty , honor , education , statesmanship , philosophy and all religions , saying , Where I am ye can not come . ' The greatest tribute God ever paid to man was that which he gave to Abraham , ' the friend of God .

" Harding Says All Will Be Well . - In his reply Mr. Harding said : " Dr. , my friends arid neighbors : " One ought not to . trust ' himself to speak his emotions on an occasion like this . Yet , somehow , I feel that If I say the things which are in my.heart I can not go far wrong . You know I am grateful . I need not say it . I do not think there can come to a man anything more precious , anything more heartening , than the certified confidence and good esteem of his friends and neighbors . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your expression comes to me , notwithstanding the intimacy of our acquaintance , which sometimes destroys confidence and good opinion . I like to think that in the greater - part of my life in this community I ? have done some things that have merited your approval , and I can wish for nothing better than that I may come back to you at the end of my public service with an esteem from our common country measurable to that which you have shown me here at home . " I have a theory of government that if you do for the nation what you do for the community you do exceeding well , because the nation is only the aggregate of communities . So I am going to play my part in the execution of my duties as Chief Magistrate of the Republic just as I would play it as a neighbor and fellow-citizen in Marion . " If I can do that which will add to the spirit of good-will , if I can do something to promote good feeling , if I can do that which will increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I will not have served in vain . We are looking upon the American Republic from a little - different , viewpoint than ever before . I shall not talk to you concerning it now . I am to make some observations day after tomorrow in an official way , and I do not desire to anticipate what I shall , say at that time . But I would like to say to you , neighbors and friends , that I am going to my work with the confidence that all will be well . I believe in the security of his American Republic . I believe the heart of American citizenship is right . I believe that the hundred millions of Americans will be - back of a rightrninded Executive just as cordially as you speak your friendship to me here today . " Therefore , r look upon the situation with the fullest confidence , and I promise you , just as I - am - ready ' to promise to America , that I mean to serve in good conscience to the best of my ability . No man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office in love of my fellow-countrymen . I have made it a. practice in my life to speak well of my ? fellow-men and ever do good . I have neither envy nor jealousy , in my heart . I feel that I am like the great citizenship of America . There is no hatred there . I could ? never be prouder in all my experience - than to apply this , kindly feeling within myself to the inauguration of a spirit of nation-wide good-will in this Republic . Wants Prayers in His Service . " I want to go to Washington with your pwers as ? well as your friendship . Though I may not always be the ideal . I want you to know that in my heart is a , reverence for Almighty God . I believe that He has His part in directing the destinies of this free people . I want Him to know of our prayers . I want Him to know of our trust in Him , and , trusting in Him and with confidence in ourselves , we need have no concern for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet to have this manifestation of your interest , your friendship and your good-will . I speak only the truth when I tell you that Mrs. Harding and I are going from you with a feeling of sorrow , with that unavoidable touch of regret which comes to every man and woman when they leave the community in which they have developed and lived so long . No one can avoid those heart pangs , and we go with a sense of great responsibility that has its effect  --  its chastening effect  --  upon any tendency to think in a spiritk of pride or superiority . We go as one of you , because the true republic calls to service those of the great common people . " If I can give expression to the nation that which fills your hearts in this solemn moment , I shall have served you and this country well . Surely I have no greater desire than to come back to Marion at the end of a term of service assured there will be the welcome on returning that has the savor of the kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is my prayer . Good fortune to- our Republic  --  that is our united wish . I hope and pray that on our journeys you will follow us with your good wishes , your assurances of . co-operation , and your continued prayers for the welfare of our country . " I thank you for myself and for Mrs. Harding again and again for this manifestation . It will hearten us more than you can know , . and you can be sure that this expression of neighborliness an , 3 , friendship will be an inspiration and an assurance- throughout the term of out . public service .
