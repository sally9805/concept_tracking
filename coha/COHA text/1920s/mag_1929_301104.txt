The Interstate Commerce Commission last week chose a new chairman for 1930 and simultaneously gave him more work to do than he or anyone else could possibly accomplish in a year 's time . By a process of rotation Frank McManamy , whose I. C. C. service began 23 years ago as a clerk , was advanced to the head of the Commission to succeed Ernest Irving Lewis . Chairman McManamy will need all his knowledge-and experience as a practical railroad man to cope with the task assigned him , because last week the Commission adopted and published its long-delayed plan for consolidating U. S. railroads . Eight years in the making , the I. C. C. plan is likely to take at least as long to execute . <P> Were not the I. C. C. a serious-minded body its Plan might have been entitled : " How to divide 250,000 miles of railroad into 19 systems and juggle them all into the air at once . " The Commission had drawn up a set of instructions for this breathtaking feat , but left for another time any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . <P> The Plan . The Transportation Act of 1920 which returned U. S. railroads from the Government to their owners ordered the Commission to prepare a nation-wide plan for consolidation . The carriers were then weak and shaky after Federal operation . It was argued that consolidation would link the strong with the weak , eliminate wasteful competition , put all roads on a profitable basis . Professor William Zebina Ripley of Harvard produced for the Commission a merger plan in 1921 which caused such dissension that it was quickly junked . Vainly the Commission wrestled with the Congressional order , made no apparent progress . Impatient at the delay , some roads ( Nickel Plate , Baltimore &; Ohio , Northern Pacific ) brought in voluntary merger plans only to have the Commission reject or ignore them . The Commission begged Congress to relieve it of the duty of framing a general plan . Congress did nothing . Finally , this year , the Commission buckled down to work , produced a plan which mustered a majority vote . <P> The general plan calls for 19 U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . It implies a managerial unification of systems as well as financial consolidation . The Commission 's prime principle was to maintain competition between systems rather than between individual roads . In each system were grouped many a short line , controlled tributary and leased feeder . <P> The 19 systems and the chief carriers grouped in each : <P> Boston &; Maine-Delaware &; Hudson , Bangor &; Aroostook . Maine Central . <P> New Haven-New York , Ontario &; Western , two important " bridge " short lines . <P> New York Central-substantially as is with the addition of Virginian . <P> **26;11104;TOOLONG as is . <P> Baltimore &; Ohio-Reading , Central of New Jersey , Chicago &; Alton , Buffalo , Rochester &; Pittsburgh , Detroit , Toledo &; Ironton ( one-half ) . <P> Chesapeake &; Ohio-Nickel Plate , Hocking Valley .
