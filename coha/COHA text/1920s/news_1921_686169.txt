txt Police Commissioner Rlehatd E. EnHeft refused yesterday in a letter to District Attorney Edward Swann to assign detectives to assist In the Whitman investigation Into alleged corruption in city departments . Ills refusal was a repetition of a refusal by the Mayor . Ex-Governor Charles S. Whitman said that the Commissioner was obliged by law to furnish the detectives and that prompt steps would be taken to obtain their services . When he was asked what steps could be taken , he said : " The Police Commissioner is answerable to the Mayor of the city and to the Governor pf the State . " When he was asked It he meant that he would ask Governor Miller to remove Commissioner Enright , Mr. Whitman declined to answer . In connection with this question , however , he called attention to the City Charter , Section 270 of which says : " The said Commissioner may , whenever , in the Judgment of the Mayor of said city , or the Governor , the public interests should require , be removed from office by either , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swann has been striving to obtain the services of . Detective Sergeant Alfred Thomas since Friday of teat week . On that day Mr. ? i ? tinn ? . ? Iito : ) , , , riw ; heterreleir with Mayor Hylan . Immediately after this Mr. Swami wrote to the Whitman Grand Jury , Allying that Mayor Hylan had agreed to assign any six city detectives to aid the investigation . Enright . quotes 31nyor Hyman . On Tuesday of this week Mayor Hylan refused to See Mr. Swann , OD the ground that the Mayor had been placed in a false position by representations that he ( the Mayor ) was one of the instigators of the investigation . On Monday anti Tuesday Mr. Swann meta telephone messages to Police Headquarters asking for Detective Sergeant Thomas , formerly a confidential man to Mr. Whitman .. , received no answer . On Wednesday he wrote a formal letter , calling attention to the alleged promise of the Mayor to furnish any six detectives and asking for Detective Thomas . To this letter he received yesterday the following reply : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 , Mi . Office of the Commissioner . Hon. Edward Swann , District Attorney , Criminal Courts Building , New York .

" Very truly yours , R. E. ENRIGHT , Police Commissioner . The Mayor 's letter , quoted by Commissioner Enright , was not made public before . It shows that , while District Attorney Swann said on Jan .. 7 that the Mayor agreed to furnish the six detectives , the Mayor on Jan. 8 wrote that he would not furnish them . Whether the Mayor changed his mind overnight , oe whether District Attorney Swann misunderstood ? the Mayor 's position , could not be straightened out yesterday . Mr. Whitman 's course might bo to appeal from Comtnissioner Enright to Mayor Hylan against the Mayor 's own words . If so , tills would probably be done for the purpose of making a record on which to appeal to the Governor , inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday indicated a. hopeless break between them . Whether the letter by Commissioner Enright was sent on his own initiative or after consultation with the Mayor could not be learned , Mien Mr. ' Whitman was asked if there was any Charter provision specifically requiring tile Police Department to homy such requests as that of District Attorney Swann , he said : It Is the duty of the Police Depart-zient to sender all the assIstinos In *dr poorer in investigating , detecting , preventing and punishing crime , whether the crime is committed by a policeman or anybody else . It is their duty to render the a.sistance required by the courts , Judges and District Attorneys in the city .
