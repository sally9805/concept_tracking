txt Herbert Hoover , in a speech before 15,000 people at the Coliseum here tonight , expanded his proposal for the creation of what he called " one of the most important institutions in our Government , " a Federal Farm Board with power to ascertain the cause and apply the remedies for the ills of agriculture . Mr. Hoover received a great ovation from the audience . The demonstration which started when he appeared on the platform lasted fifteen minutes . Mr. Hoover and Mrs. Hoover were escorted to the platform by Secretary of War Dwight F. Davis , Henry S. Caufield , Republican candidate for Governor of Missouri , and Dr. Work , Chairman of the National Committee . Time and time again Mr. Hoover and Mr. Caufield , who presided , pleaded with the crowd to be quiet . But it was no use . The crowd wanted to yell , and it yelled itself hoarse . Nobody knows what Mr. Caufield said . Not until he sat down and Mr. Hoover stepped forward did the crowd begin to yield . In the end Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheers . Farm relief and agriculture was the candidate 's text , and all through his speech ran the Republican battle cry of " prosperity , " a prosperity built up , Mr. Hoover insisted , by the Republican Party in the Harding and Coolidge Administrations . The crowd was enthusiastic throughout and many times Mr. Hoover was interrupted by applause . When he said that the Democratic Party is not the party for the American farmer and the American workman to entrust with revision of the tariff , the response of the crowd assumed the proportions of an ovation . When the candidate declared his opposition of letting down the immigration bars there was another noisy outbreak . Again the applause was deafening following Mr. Hoover 's promise to call an extra session of the Seventyfirst Congress to work out a solution of the farm problem . This action , he added , was dependent on what the final session of the present Congress did in the way of farm relief legislation . In beginning his address Mr. Hoover referred to his speech in New York in which he denounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " State socialism . " However , he did not again use the expression which started so much backfire from the Democratic camp . Deals With Constructive Matters . " Tonight I propose to discuss the constructive side of government , " he said . " A few nights ago in New York I had occasion to discuss these principles in application to matters which the Government should not undertake . Tonight I discuss them ' in connection with matters which the Government should and must undertake . " Through what Mr. Hoover described as a revolution in ideas and methods the United States , he said , had developed a new economic system , the dominating idea of which is , he continued , the steady increasing , through the cooperation of capital and labor , of the efficiency of production and distribution . " For us to adopt other social conceptions , " Mr. Hoover declared . " such as Federal or State Govern : ment entry into commercial business in competition with its . citiens , - would undermine initiative and ? enterprise and destroy the . fouadations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is builded . Outlines Federal Functions . " True progressivism , " Mr. Hoover said , " does not include policies which would destroy progress . " There are three potential fields in which the principles and impulses of our American system require that government take constructive action . They comprise those activities which no local community can itself assume and which the individual initiative and enterprise of our people can not wholly compass . They corn prise leadership of the Government to solve many difficult problems . " The first of these fields includes the great undertakings , in public works , such as inland waterways , flood control , reclamation , highways and public buildings . " The second of these is the necessary interest and activity of the Federal Government in fostering education , public health , scientific research , public parks , conservation of national resources , agriculture , industry and foreign commerce . " The third great field lies in broadening the assistance of the Government to the growing efforts of our people to cooperation among themselves to useful social and economic ends . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoover , in turn , discussed agriculture and waterways , concluding with a brief summing-up of the broader issues which in this campaign , he said , are paramount in importance . He did not name prohibition , and he goes to the country , so far as that issue is involved , on his speech of acceptance in which he declared prohibition to be a " noble experiment . " He is opposed to the repeal of the Eiehteenth Amendment . The completion of a great inland ' waterways system , converging on New Orleans , was again urged by Mr. Hoover as of the best of contributing forces to the solution of the farm problem . He brought his audience cheering to its feet when , recalling the great Mississippi flood of last year , he pledged himself to adequate flood control of that great river . In the main , his farm relief proposals were the same as he has advanced before , first in his acceptance speech and subsequently at West Branch , Iowa . His Plan for Federal Farm Board . " In addition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agriculture and cheaper waterway transportation in assistance to agriculture , " the Republican Party proposes to go further . It proposes to set up an institution which will be one of the most important institutions in our Government , designed to meet not only the varied problems which confront us today , but those that may arise in the future . " We propose to create a Federal farm board composed of men of understanding and ' sympathy for the problems of agriculture ; we propose this board should have power to determine the facts , the causes , the remedies which should be applied to each and every one of the multitude of problems which we mass under the general term , the agricultural problem . " Mr. Hoover 's first speech today was - at Louisville , where he was ' accorded a rousing welcome by thousands of Kentuckians who braved the rain to roar - their greeting to the Republican candidate . It was said that the crovid was not as big as the one that welcomed Governor Smith , and  --  the reason , said the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parade ? through the principal streets cheered by the thousands who lined the sidewalks and crowded the windows ' of every building along the way . At ' the .. Tef- person County Armory , where he spoke , a crowd of more than 10,000 jammed that building to capacity . William P. Harrison , the Republican Mayor of Louisville , presided and introduced Mr. Hoover as the next President . That was as far as hp got . The crowd wanted Hoover . Text of the Louisville Speech . The text of Mr. Hoover 's speech at Louisville is as follows : " I am grateful to you for your genereals welcome . This reception is in beeping with that hospitality of the Men and women for which your city bas been known for a hundred years . Nn one . can come within its boundaries without being reminded of that long list of great leaders which Kentticky has given to the nation , from Zfenry Clay to Henry Watterson . " I know the cordial and friendly greeting which you give to me is not m the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties , and it is no little gratification to me that you have taken the time to come to bid me welcome . " We are now nearing the close of the campaign . The issues have been thoroughly discussed . Within a few days more than forty million people will go to the polls to express their views as to the character of the Government and the policies they wish to see continued in their country . " There is no other country in the world where forty million people on a single day will go to the ballot box to expess their determination . It has never before happened in all history . It is the greatest spectacle and inspiration of self-government the world has ever witnessed . " The American people are meeting the greatest responsibility of government when they resolve to go to the polls and express themselves on election day . The enormous registration which brings this unparalleled vote to the polls is-itself expressive of the seriousness of the issues and the earnestness and conviction with which our people are meeting them . " This evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gratifying to every one Who has its welfare at heart . It means - more than triumph of one party over another ; more than victory of one individual as against another : it means in the end the trieenph of that everlasting principle of self-government , upon which America has grown to the leadership of the world . Responsibilities of Government . " The relationship of our Government to our people and to all their activities increases day by day . Our relationship with the rest of the world is vastly expanded ; our interest in world peace is vastly increased . We deal with vastly more intricate and delicately adjusted business systems than ever before . " The policies of our Government bear an increasing responsibility for continued national prosperity and national progress , not only moral but spiritual . Upon the soundness of its principles and policies depend not alone the employment and high standards of living of our people , but the peace of the world and the place that America occupies in the world . " The prosperity of Kentucky is completely interdependent on the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products must be sold outside your borders . Markets for your products are dependent upon the prosperity a other States . " Under the Administration of the last seven and a half years our country as a whole has made unparalleled progress . Not every group has marched- in the front rank , but no man can say that our country is not stronger , that his hopes are not greater than they were seven years ago . " The peace of the world has been solidified . We have gained in domestic peace and prosperity Prosperity is no idle expression . The continuation of prosperity is of vital interest to every worker 's job and to the safety and safeguard of every business and every home . " The issues before us are moral as well as economic . They affect the welfare of every home . The result of the election will affect the direction of our national thought and our national actions for many years to come . " I do not believe the American people , in a time of such manifest evidence ' of progress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education and moral forces , would wish to change in their policies . " Greeted at Man y Stations . Thousands of people saw Mr. I Hoover as his train passed through Indiana and Illinois on its way to St. Louis . Every town , big and small , was out in force . At only a few of them the special stopped , and then only for a few minutes . Mr. Hoover made no speeches , explaining that he was conserving his voice for his St. Louis speech . The towns where the crowds seemed largest were North Vernon , Washington , Mitchell and Seymour , in Indiana , and Lawrenceville , Flora and Salem , in Illinois , the last named the birthplace of W. 3 . Bryan . Mr. Hoover will speak briefly in Pueblo tomorrow night and again over the radio from Palo Alto Monday night , but in the strict sense of the term those will not be campaign utterances . Immediately after his speech Mr. Hoover returned to his special train and continued his journey .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
