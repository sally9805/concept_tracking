Boats placidly puffing from bank to bank , street cars clanging across cities are too slow for man 's impatience . He must blast tunnels under peaceful rivers , bore subways through the solid earth that his transit may be measured in swift seconds . Men willingly give up sunshine and fresh air to work in the dark , dank underground ; they will not willingly give up their lives . Last week Thomas J. Curtis , International President of the Tunnel and Subway Constructors Union , General Manager of the Building and Allied Trades Compensation Bureau , told the Welfare Council of Manhattan of the dangers run by subway workers . <P> All day the men grind through the rock with drills . All day the air is filled with minute particles of stone , deadly dangerous dust is sucked into human lungs with every breath . The dust varies according to the stone , but wherever there is quartz , flint , ganister , sandstone , granite , there silica particles lead all the rest . These tiny glasslike fragments do not dissolve in the moisture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrate the lungs , enter the cells . The crowded cells clump together . In an effort to protect the body , fibres begin to grow around the " clumps . " Gradually the lungs choke up with the tough fibrous growth , the chest becomes rigid , can not expand ; breathing becomes difficult ; tubercle baccilli find a rich , fertile breeding ground ; the rock driller dies of silicosis , tuberculosis , or both . <P> Union President Curtis said men were dying of silicosis at the rate of one a week . Seventy-five examinations revealed 75 pairs of lungs that can not last five years . An effort is being made to examine each of the 1,500 subway workers of Manhattan , but the men are afraid . Silicosis is not on the list of Industrial Diseases ; men found to be suffering from it would probably lose their jobs ; would receive no compensation . <P> The granite cutters of Aberdeen , the miners of South Africa and Great Britain have surrendered their quota to death by silicosis . These places have their mines and quarries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fibres around the cell " clumps " is in the nature of a healing process . If the irritation were stopped at this stage the lungs would heal . It is the increasing accumulation of silica particles and the continued growth of fibres that finally cause death . Perhaps the present agitation will move the New York State Legislature to pass the compensation bill it has neglected for four years . The Board of Transportation at any rate is eager to do its immediate utmost . Said deputy chief engineer Colonel John R. Slattery : " . . . Two methods of preventing trouble from this source have been approved . They are the use of gas masks and the carrying of an extra hose line with which to wet down the drilling surface . The men dislike using either , however , because the gas mask is uncomfortable and the hose line means extra work . " South Africa has devised the best remedy . A vacuum pumping system suctions the dust away from the drill point , leaving the air safe .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
