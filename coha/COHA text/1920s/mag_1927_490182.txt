THE New Year looks bright for commercial aviation  --  but what about the future of drug stores ? Are we to have another year of not knowing whether you pay the soda counter man or buy a check from the cashier 's cage , and when ? Some stores use one method , some another , and you never know . To the consumer this unsettled condition stands out as a minor stumbling block to human progress . For ourself , we resent the check-inadvance method , because we find it highly embarrassing to approach a strange cashier lady ( one who has nothing to do with our soda ) and announce that we want a check for a raspberry nut sundae with a dash of whipped cream . Suppose she were to get the wrong impression ? And we resent checks anyway , because it 's a wilful destruction of our national forests to make them and throw them away . We demand a Will Hays to regulate drug store procedure . This may not be a very important issue right now ; but it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin drinking sodas . FROM time to time we try to bring forward suggestions designed to help our readers in a business way . Usually they are pretty good : witness our proposal , not long ago , that someone erect a building devoted to athletics .

" MR . COOLIDGE states that he has given no thought to securing another position . That attitude is understandable , but the President should be reminded ( and we are the one to do it ) that it is always much easier to get a job if you already have one .

Amid phone calls , amid this and that , he was nervously pawing over papers , picking up here , laying down there , a pitiful little figure in his so complex struggle against industrial activity . Suddenly he dropped everything and a look came to his eyes . Gazing wildly out the window , he pointed to a tremendous office building across the way , which rose dismally from the murk of the city . " Look , " he cried , feverishly , " see that mass of steel and brick  --  all based on what ? 1 , Vhy , on sex !

Bryant Heath BAVANT PARK , we have discovered , is open to suspicion as a heath for witches . At least it has cats . They are mysterious and do n't lie in the sun like tabby cats and are invisible at all times save when a black-cloaked old lady arrives with a little sack of liver and a bottle of milk . Then , at her call , they materialize . It turns out that the cats went to Bryant Park . to live when the square was all torn up and splotched with the tool houses and shanties of subway diggers . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Now the heath is no longer at sixes and sevens and there are no more scraps . There is only the black-cloaked lady , who is Mrs. Ellen McLaughlin of Tenth Avenue . Every day she comes , as she has for many months , and at her call of " Kitty , come kitty , " the cats appear from somewhere ? from about the statues and from under the kiosks and orange drink stands . This is like magic , for anyone else could call " kitty " for hours without bringing anything to pass except possibly the appearance of the Industrial Squad from Headquarters . Mrs. McLaughlin herself is able to touch only one of the cats , a black fellow she calls Nigger , although she has a long acquaintance with another , a ruffian named Bitesome who has but one eye . Before he came over to Bryant Park for self-improvement he lived in Hell 's Kitchen and Mrs. McLaughlin knew him there .

Sesame THE heroine of this tale of the underworld always reaches the subway express just as the doors close quietly but firmly . The other evening , being in just the mood for it , she began running toward the front of the train , heating upon all the doors she came to . just before the express moved out , one of them popped open . It was the motorman 's . He poked his head out and bowed the lady into his cab . A Roland for an Oliver SOME months ago pieces began to 1 J appear here and there in print poking satire at cigarette advertisements , signed rather awkwardly , " The Tobacco Society for Voice Culture . " The use of anything but the attack direct did not seem , to one restlessly inquisitive advertising man , the work of the usual anti-cigarette society , and he made inquiries . He now advises us that Mr. Henry Bern , who lives in West Eleventh Street , is the society . Mr. Bern is a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , though , that they do his vocal cords much good , and it annoyed him to see advertisements implying that concert singers and public speakers were benefited by them . He wrote a couple of letters to the papers about it , but this did n't seem to put a stop to the advertisements . Hotter than ever , he thereupon decided to give the cigarette makers tit for tat in publicity . Hiring a trio of professional writers he paid them  --  and still does , our informant says  --  to write satirical articles on the subject . These are sent free of charge to columnists , magazines and the like . Now and then something is printed . THROUGH dense lines of halted GH traffic a hook and ladder fought its way up Fifth Avenue , its crew breezily intent on duty . The truck was very noisy and very red and as we paused to watch its dashing progress , a lady at our side in the crowd spoke to her companion . " My , " she said , " does n't it look Christmassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday sidewalks of Fifth Avenue , one afternoon last week , we saw a postman emerge waving on high a square white envelope bright with Christmas seals . Dropping his whistle , the traffic policeman ( the one with the moustache , who stands at the corner of Thirty-fifth Street ) tripped , more lightly and fantastically than we thought he could , over to the curb to claim his letter . Relating the charming interlude to a friend downtown , we were told that Mr. Bill Troler , who has a finger in the destiny of traffic at Fulton Street and Broadway , always carries half a dozen lollipops in his pocket . These he gives to the little maids from school ? preferably the little brunette ones  --  that he helps across the street while traffic leans its chin on its hand . There is also at hand , just in time , the story of a Christmas shipper from Jersey who , becoming confused in midtown , approached the officer stationed at Fifty-third Street and the Avenue .

" Author WHEN out of the dark at the Guild Theatre , where " Strange Interlude " and " Marco Millions " are being rehearsed , a brief suggestion comes from a quiet young man sitting alone , everyone is a bit surprised . The young man is Eugene O'Neill , who wrote the plays , and most of the time he slips in and out without anyone knowing about it . He has even sat silent while appreciable changes are made in his plays  --  always difficult to stage . Only twice since he came to town ( just for the plays , because he is n't at home here ) has he had much to say about them . Once he somewhat vehemently denied the contention that " Interlude , " being an hour or so longer than the conventional play , is likely to be wearisome . He does n't believe anyone will notice that . On the other occasion he requested that a certain player be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in O'Neill plays when it was not easy to get actors to do so . O'Neill stops at a quiet hotel in the Forties and keeps much to himself . He is appreciably annoyed by flattery and attention . One hears few persons call him by his first name . Among those who do are several Times Square sightseeing bus proprietors , acquaintances of other dais ; and , of course , no end of wandering sailors with whom he has shipped on one voyage or another have that privilege . He is seldom seen about Broadway , even though he was born at the corner of Broadway and Forty-third Street , where the Hotel Cadillac now stands . Recently , at the behest of coaxing companions , he consented to make his first tour of the revues and night clubs . At its conclusion he announced it would be his last . He likes to go , however , to Madison Square Garden for the prize-fights and the six-day races , and one of the few persons he is known to have expressed a desire to meet is Tex Rickard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arising from the tragic note of his plays that he is morose and pessimistic . He is , as a matter of fact , an entertaining companion , they say , and takes delight in recounting droll stories with feeling and skill . He has always had a deep sense of the theatre , originating ( everyone says of course ) in the fact that his father was James O'Neill of " Monte Cristo " fame . The playwright is married and he has two children . One of his daughters is named Oona . His own middle name , which he used to indicate with a G in his signature but no longer does , is Gladstone . His plays now bring him a comfortable income . The original scripts are all in his possession , where they remain despite offers for them reported to be as high as five figures . He is only thirty-nine , but his hair is beginning to gray . Sherwood Forest WE were astonished the other day in the Pennsylvania Station to hear the horns of elfland faintly blowing . Come to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old-fashioned horn every day five minutes before the departure of the Broadway Limited . This has been going on for six months . What Every Adult Should Know INSURANCE salesmen have always been glamorous in our eyes , because they go to places we would n't dare go and face odds that would make us quail . While we were lunching with one of these dare-devils last week ( he had been in our psychology class at college ) he unexpectedly confessed all . He told us that the reason it is possible to make what seem to be impossible sales is that the average man secretly believes he can argue the hide off any salesman , and likes to hear himself try . Once he starts arguing , he hangs himself . After listening to our friend 's disclosures , we are in a position to reveal the cardinal principle for insulating oneself against insurance . It is : always make the wrong answer to the salesman 's questions , which are all scientif1() Dr.cEmBEN 31 , 19 Z 7 ically designed to bring forth the answer Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , expect you to take the soundness and the general worthiness of the idea of insurance for granted . This never comes into question . Then he will start off very candidly with some such disarming question as this : " Now , Mr. Fish , as you know I have come to see you about insurance . I assume , sir , that a man of your business integrity has already made provision against unforeseen circumstances , have n't you ? " ( You say Yes . ) " Just as a matter of sound business sense you have created an estate for the protection of your wife , have n't you ? " ( You say Yes . ) " Furthermore , I assume that you wish your son Roger to enjoy the educational advantages in life that he deserves , do n't you ? " ( Another Yes . ) Well , if you say Yes to all these questions you are a goner because he has a whole string of others calling for affirmative answers which lead inevitably to the execution of a policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . If you say No he will still go on trying to sell you insurance but he will be too stunned and dazed to accomplish anything . A good variation is to say , when the salesman refers to your wife : " I left my wife last week . " When he speaks of your son , who will soon be ready for college , bite your lips and to say that unfortunately your marriage was childless . Our friend also informs us that in this business they no longer use the term " to sign " a thing ; they say : " to write your name . " The word " sign " has come to have a sinister tone . Do n't let this trick fool you  --  writing your name is just as binding . ASCOUT who got separated from the Lewis and Clarke expedition arrived hack in town last week with tidings of our western states . He tells us that the photoplay " Annie Laurie " is being shown in the frontier opera houses under the title of " Ladies from Hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of the trenches that separate the Upper East Side residential district from the tenement district that lies above it should go to Fifth Avenue at One Hundredth Street . The No Man 's Land beginning in that vicinity is an uneven strip , running across the East Side from Fifth to Lexington . On Fifth , Society has found its Farthest North . The apartment houses have recently gained a footing beyond the Mount Sinai Hospital , once thought to be an impas'sable social barrier , and have established a sentinel in the 1200 block . Then comes the Heckschcr Foundation and a stylish new building on One Hundred and Seventh Street , a home for aged Jews . The last of these buildings puts the quietus on Fifth Avenue at that point . It is a Dead Man 's Hill . Even that section of the battle-line above Ninety-sixth Street is precariously supported , for the enemy are heavily massed . It is on Park that they fight hand to hand . No Man 's Land curves sharply down from One Hundred and Second on Fifth to Ninety-seventh on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is the lovely Squadron A Armory on your left as you stand looking north , against the wall of which babes and nurses sun themselves . Beyond that are cobblestones and the tracks . Then the terrain dips sharply , and a few blocks below is an open air pushcart market in full blast  --  a veritable marche des puces . Seldom does any vehicle come up or go down this hill ; most of the houses on it are vacant  --  it is a true No Man 's Land . The fighting area sweeps east and south again in a sharp curve , until it reaches Lexington , about Ninety-fifth Street . Tenements crowd against the eastern side of that upper reach of Park Avenue as they do against that still more remote reach of Fifth ; and east of Lexington lies trouble . The few residents of East End Avenue close to the River at Eighty-seventh Street must cross Avenue A , First , Second , and Third Avenues before they reach safety . Further south the eastward movement carries the good private house section to Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sixty-ninth . That 's the situation at present . Fifth and Park have reached their absolute limit . A great deal of mopping-up needs to be done in the side-streets still , but those Avenues can go no further . It is up to Lexington . Prima Donnas IN such bird circles as we occasionally grace we learn that the Blue Shell Parrakeet is a fad again this year , but we are far more interested in the fact that Piping B u / 1- finches are still approvedin fashionable and artistic circles , as attested by the fact that Wanamaker 's sold all of the twenty-eight in its Christmas stock . The Piping Bullfinch is distinguished from the ordinary bullfinch by the fact that it really learns to whistle tunes . These are largely old German and French nursery melodies , because most of them are trained by patient souls in those countries . Each has its repertory listed on its cage . If you did not see them in the bird stores it is because they are kept separate to safeguard these programs . Left with other birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' notes . They are a little smaller than our robin , with plump , slate-colored bodies . black heads and buff-colored breasts , and they cost seventy-five dollars each . A Boulevard of Books I some mysterious way , the old- ' book-shop atmosphere of Fourth Avenue below Fourteenth Street has remained unviolated by the great doings of the age . Even such modern affairs as Wanamaker 's , Hammacher - Schlemmer , traffic lights , and the marble post office on Thirteenth Street have not encroached upon the row of old houses with a lot of dusty . books in them . There are more bookstores there than ever . West Fifty-ninth Street , for so long considered Fourth Avenue 's most serious rival , is gradually declining , not because the business has been bad , but because the buildings have been coming down . Perhaps it is the Bible House opposite Wanamaker 's and Cooper Union and the Choir and Chapter Houses of Grace Church that have preserved the curious virtue of the Fourth Avenue district . The downtown old-book section consists of a few famous stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Sixth Avenue book shops are scattered and hidden . It is only on Fourth that you can go from door to door and find them all bookstores ; only there can you find the indigent bibliophile in any real quantity or spot the old lady who has read " Alice in Wonderland " looking for a " set " of Lewis Carroll , On Fourth Avenue no one cares whether you buy or not  --  and that 's always one of the characteristics of a true quarter . When it comes to " discoveries , " however , Fourth Avenue is not the place to go . According to those who shop there regularly and who knew it when it was young , the days of the bargain are gone . If you pay two dollars for a book , the chances are that it is worth less rather than more . But there is one curious kind of secondhand book that you can still buy there , and that is the reviewer 's copy . Often it is sold second hand before it is sold first hand ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , has to hurry off and sell for a quarter or fifty cents the book he has just reviewed . In that way they dribble into the stalls even before they are to he offered at Brentano 's . A Cab W arming CANE of the interesting openings of the past week was that of the new taxicab of one Mr. Triferellio . When we stepped into it at Times Square we found the tonneau appointed with just the right homey ' touch . In a wire rack several current numbers of the best magazines were reposing , and at our right hand were matches , an opened package of cigarettes , and an ashtray . Our host explained that this was his first day out with the new car and that he was not to be outdone by Fifth Avenue shops in the amenities on opening day .
