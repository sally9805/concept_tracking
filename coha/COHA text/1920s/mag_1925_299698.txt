If it were unprofitable to grow opium poppies , few would be grown . The opium question is solved : let chemists discover how to make synthetic opium and how to make it more cheaply than the poppy product . <P> Such was the millennialistic idea put forward , last week , by Dr. Carleton Simon , Special Deputy Police Commissioner of New York City . It struck Special Deputy Police Commissioner Herman A. Metz as such a good idea that he promptly offered a prize of $100,000 for discovery of the synthetic formula . <P> In such matters , Mr. Metz is something more than a mere layman . He owns many chemical factories . But laboratory scientists were slow in getting to work . Said Columbia Professor of Chemistry Bogert : " Mr. Metz has risked little by his offer . . . . The making of a synthetic opium that will have all the medicinal qualities , or the good qualities , and be shy of the narcotic , or bad qualities , is something that I do not believe will be done-at least for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' main objective would seem to be achieved if a synthetic opium having narcotic qualities were discovered . Such a formula could be controlled by the Government and would serve to destroy the vested poppy interests , as synthetic dyes replaced indigo growing .
