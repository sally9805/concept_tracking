txt Controller Charles W. Berry said last night that if he were given the opportunity to make the 1927 budget and held authority over all the city departments commensurate with the control he exercises in his own Department of Finance , he could prevent the proapectiVe Increase of ; 38.700,000 in the 1927 budget and could keep it within the limitations of the budget for the current year , which figure is $437:000.000 . Budget Director Charles L. Kohler is striving to keep the 1927 total below $476,000,000 . The Controller 's assertion , which was emphatic and deliberate , was predicated upon this question , which was asked by reporters : " Do you think the ' budget for 1927 could be kept within the limits of the budget for the current year ? ' ! General Berry replied : " Reframe your question slightly . Suppose you ask me , if given the chance , could I keep the budget for 1927 within the limits of the budget for 1926 ? In that case my answer is yes . " Would Start Reorganization . Pressed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had adequate authority , Controller Berry declared it could be done by a proper reorganization of virtually every one of the city departments to eliminate duplications of activities and by the elimination of various wasteful methods not in practice in many of them . The Controller intimated that what he would seek to bring about in the interest of municipal economy would be along lines somewhat similar to those employed by Governor Smith in the reorganization and consolidation of State departments . Although declining to specify at length the instances of wastefulness and unnecessary expenditures in the city government which he had in mind , the Controller merely , by , way of illustration , referred to an item to which he had called attention some months ago . This was the extravagance in the purchase , maintenance and operation of automobiles used by city employes other than those necessary for the service of the fire , police and street cleaning departments . That item alone , he said , had mounted in cost from a total of $500,000 in 1917 to an aggregate of $4.000.000 in the budget for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been pointed out that the automobiles that have caused this great increase in expense are used principally for personal transportation . Controller Berry also had in mind an inquiry made by him some months ago which showed that the municipal taxicab service , maintained at the city 's expense for the use of department employes , costs 50 cents a. mile to operate , whereas only 30 cents a mile is charged by privately capitalized taxicab companies which are operated at a profit . His Own Budget Lower . As an evidence of his entire good faith in making the assertion that the 1927 budget could be kept down to the figures of that of 1926 despite an increase in fixed charges , and as an illustration of the possibility of departmental economies , the Controller might have cited the fact that the proposed budget submitted to Director Kohler by the Department of Finance , of which Controller Berry is the chief . is a little smaller for 1927 than the figure allowed that department for 1926. it is said to be the only city department whose estimates have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has effected economies of administration which have enabled him to reduce his departmental estimate , in spite of the fact that he provides in it for salary increases for more than one-half of all his department employes , who appear to him to be deserving of such recognition . To keep the 1927 budget within the figure of $476,000,000 and to prevent the increase over the 1W6 budget from running in excess of  --  from $38.000,000 to $40.000.000 over the allowances for the current year it will be necessary that the total departmental appropriations for 1927 shall not exceed $309,612,000 . The departmental appropriations in the budget for 1926 aggregate $288,146. - 333 . That means that to hold the prospective increase within the $40,000,000 figure all departmental appropriations in the aggregate for 1927 can not be increased more than $21,465,667 . Agrees Tax Rate Will Rise . As for the prospective tax rate for the coming year , the Controller verified the accuracy of the prediction yesterday that with a budget increase in round figures of about $40,000,000 the basic tax rate would mount from $2.68 per $100 of valuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 . That statement is made , Controller Berry explained , upon the assumption that the city stands to gain an increase of $1.000,000.000 for the coming year in taxable assessed valuations over the current year 's figures . Should the new taxable assessed valuations fall short of $1,000,000,000 , the tax rate , of course , would become proportionately higher . The Controller , however , said he hail been adv ? sed by the Board of Taxes and Assessments that because of the tremendous vorume of new building construction the increase in taxable valuation probably would not fall short of a round billion . Another reform that ultimately would effect a budget economy , according to the Controller , would be a proper provision through taxation to meet such costs as those essential now to the carrying of . the city 's special revenue bonds and tax notes . Interest charges on these obligations become a heavy burden yearly . This year , for instance , among the fixes charges , which of course are mandatory , is an item of $5,000,000 for interest . Such charges as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future by anticipation of the expenditures for which the city 's tax notes and special revenue bonds are Issued annually .
