txt Seneca Falls today They Have is a village , just as Reason it was seventy-five for Pride . years ago , when ELIZADETYI CADY STANTON , LUCRETIA More and a few other women met there , and , with the formality of , calling themselves a convention , started a campaign that must have seemed little less than hopeless , even to themselves . The little less , however , ' was enough for them , and they dared to make demands which the milder of their critics Called ridiculous and the more severe an impious effort to change the laws of GOD as well as of man . The suffrage leaders of that day all are gone now , but some of them lived to see the attainment of their ambition . They and their successors in the movement slowly overcame derision and denunciation by their courage and their energy . Whatever one 's view of their achievement may be , denial of its magnitude is impossible .

Just what the discriminations are it takes a. lawyer to . see . To the ordinary observer , in most of our States . women already have all ' the rights and privileges possessed by men , and then , at least by custom , a few more , but the feminists are not ordinary observers and they are not ready to declare peace with the ancient enemy while he retains even a trace of his old legal superiorI ties .

Admirable as is simplicity , in making or amending constitutions as in so many other things , it also has its dangers , and it is not for nothing that lawyers have been led to develop a language of their own , the characteristic of which is what to other people is a redundancy of words . Experience has taught them to be explicit  --  to say not only what thty mean , but all of it . One or them , considering the sentence just quoted , well might pretend not to know precisely what significance to attach to the phrase " equal rights . " It does not mean , " necessarily , the same rights . So , if " and the same rights " should not be acldsd to the proposed amendment , why should n't it ? If our inunigraThey ?

The present method of letting birthplace determine nationality and race sometimes is obviously absurd , That is , not infrequently , it leads to absurdity . Our law makes a mistake like the one common among ethnologists of another day , who deduced race from language , forgetting the frequency with which languages not their own have been imposed on subject peoples or voluntarily adapted by inferior ones . Last week there arrived at this port a baby that had been born on the way over from Europe .. Its parents were Fides , but the ship was British . Under the law our immigration officials had to reason thus : A British ship is British territory ; therefore this baby can not I enter on Poland 's unfilled quota , but must be excluded because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference of nationality between a new-born baby and its parents was I gravely announced ! . That this ruling will be reversed may be expected with some confidence , but no self-respecting official should have " been required to render himself ridiculous by making it . That Bridge As was to have at Bear been expected , the Palisades Park CornMountain. missioners have pro- , tested against the criticism of their Bear Mountain Bridge that was made by LAWnszccs Ass= in The Outlook last week . They say that his picture of an I admittedly ugly bridge is not a picture ' of the bridge they purpose to let the bridge company build , but of a bridge that would have been built if an earlier plan had not - been rejected . They say , too , that it was the State . Legislature that decided the . material out of which the towers should be made , and insisted that steel , not stone , should be used . What particularly . annoyed the Park Commissioners , according to their spokesman , ' President J. B. WHITE , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private financial interest in keeping the cost of the bridge as low as possible . But Mr. . A.Esarr did not make that charge ; he said it was a rumor which he hoped was untrue . Presumably , he is sorry . that he repeated it , I and certainly he is sorry if he printed a wrong picture . It now remains for the Commissioners to prove that the bridge , even with steel 11 towers , is going to be a handsome one . That would be the finest sort of an end for the little controversy . as a . bridge right there is a near-necessary , and just as well as not it can be a beautiful one , congruous with the land- i scene . /
