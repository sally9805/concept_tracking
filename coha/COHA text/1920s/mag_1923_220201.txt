To combine the 62 railway systems west of Chicago into four great groups is the plan of President Hale Holden of the Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy . Each group would include 30,000 to 35,000 miles of rail ; each would have an investment value of approximately two billions ; each would have access to the Great Lakes , the Gulf of Mexico , the Pacific Ocean . The divisions proposed are based geographically upon the four great systems of the West : <P> The Hill Railroads . <P> The Union Pacific . <P> The Santa Fe . <P> The Southern Pacific . <P> " This plan , " says Mr. Holden , " would bring about reduction in rates . Better service could be rendered by the roads , and delay at junction points would be eliminated . Car supply to shippers would be more flexible , and a beter general standard of service would be maintained on all lines . " <P> By provisions of the Esch-Cummins Transportation Act ( passed in 1920 ) " the Interstate Commerce Commission shall as soon as practicable prepare and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the continental United States into a limited number of systems . " Under this law the Commission must act just as if the Sherman Anti-Trust law were nullified by its provisions . Later the Supreme Court will decide whether such combinations are legal . The Court may hold that the Sherman Act applies only where the combination is to the public detriment . <P> Rail executives , railway lawyers , and the press are of divided opinion as to the feasibility of Mr. Holden 's plan . <P> But Arthur Brisbane , Hearst editor , continues to advocate " one big merger " - government ownership .
