John Jacob Raskob has been both bull and bear . His most bearish moment was on the eve of the bankers ' convention ( TIME , Oct. 15 ) , when he observed that " security prices have far outrun demonstrated values . " His most bullish moment was on the eve of his sailing for Europe last March , when he predicted new records for General Motors , observing that the stock should sell at 15 times its earnings , or $225 a share . <P> Time graciously justified the Most Bullish Moment . General Motors did set new records , did eventually climb to a tantalizing 224 ? . But by the time the stock had reached Bull Raskob 's figure , earnings had also skyrocketed . Last week , when President Alfred P. Sloan , Jr . announced quarterly profits of $79,266,639 , nine months ' profits of $240,534,613 ( record for any corporation in peace time ) , investors hastily calculated values . In nine months , General Motors had earned $13.42 a share . Expected earnings for the full year raised the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15x " would set the stock 's value at $270 , or $49 over last week 's closing price . <P> Investors made yet another calculation . Even more significant than General Motors in the eyes of many a businessman are the reports of the mighty U. S. Steel Corp. , now ending its first full year under committee management . As everyone knows , the mantle of the late , great Elbert H. Gary was rent into three parts . The first part fell on John Pierpont Morgan as Chairman of the Board ; the second on Myron Charles Taylor as Chairman of the Finance Committee ; the third on James Augustine Farrell as President . Last week , this triumvirate of tycoons announced quarterly earnings of $52,148,476 , largest in two years and $10,774,645 more than earnings in the third quarter of 1927 . <P> Nine months ' earnings of U. S. Steel totaled $140,015,494 , or $8.17 a share . Expected earnings for the full year would be about $11 . By the Raskob formula , the stock 's value should approximate $165 . Actually , U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 160 ? . <P> With Steel confirming the " 15x " theory , did investors hold General Motors cheap at 222 , rush to brokers with orders to buy ? Prudent investors consulted prudent stockmarketeers . They learned : 1 ) that the " 15x " formula might justify itself in a strong bull market , but that it could not be maintained in a slump ; 2 ) that many a sound , conservative stock , undisturbed by pools , sells at 10x or 12x ; 3 ) that 5-year earnings are safer guides than 9 months or a year . <P> Other quarterly reports , cheering stockholders last week , were : <P> E. I. du Pont de Nemours Co. ( just merged with Grasselli Chemical Co. ) : $19,581,897 , as against $12,488,554 for the third quarter of 1927 . <P> Canada Dry Ginger Ale Co. : $954,976 as against $521,252 . <P> Victor Talking Machine Co. : $4,646,617 ( 9 months ) as against $4,069,753 . <P> Pullman , Inc. : $6,192,896 , as against $3,777,450 ( preceding quarter ) . <P> Not so cheering were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $289,326 ( deficit ) , as against $125,801 ( profit ) . <P> Madison Square Garden Corp . ( prizefights , campaign speeches ) : $308,448 ( deficit ) , as against $52,848 ( profit ) .
