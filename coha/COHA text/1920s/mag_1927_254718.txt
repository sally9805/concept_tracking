What do taxicab drivers think about ? <P> One thing they thought about in Chicago last week was what would become of them if Samuel Insull ( purveyor of light , heat and trolley rides to most of Chicago and its purlieus ) should decide to take the city 's taxicab situation in hand . That was the rumor , vague and unelaborated but still striking-that Samuel Insull would stride among the Chicago taxicab companies , either to compete with them or absorb them as one more of his big utility schemes . <P> Chicago has 15 cab companies , 5,000 cabs . Competition is sharp , service perhaps the best in the country ( Chicago is the mother city of Yellow Cabs ) . But Chicago cabbies fare thinly , they are so many . Samuel Insull might , on his record , be expected to thin out the cabby ranks , profit fatly by organizing adroitly , eliminate some of the risk that exists when too many cabbies are speeding and dodging to glean a living . <P> If Chicago presents a cab problem , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McAdoo last fortnight deplored the presence of 17,000 cabs , most of them plying night and day in the congested runways of an island only 12by12 miles . Competition between the 17,000 is so great that , in Mr. McAdoo 's words , " You can stand on any corner and count the number of taxicabs in proportion to other vehicles and two-thirds of them are taxicabs , cruising , cruising , empty , empty , everywhere ! " <P> A taxicab spokesman replied that 17,000 was only 2% of the total vehicle registration in New York City , that New Yorkers want and need cabs at all hours . The Times , without warning , waxed humorous , and said : " Mr. McAdoo may be pardoned the slight hyperbole . It has been scientifically demonstrated that the average load of a taxicab in these parts is .83 of a passenger . Private automobiles offend to a somewhat less degree , averaging 1.7 passengers and just a trace of dog - generally lap dog .

Last week , for example , idle* eyes lit up at the screamer headline " HIGHER CAB RATE PLANNED . " <P> Another news item began : " Watch for this man , " relating the evil practice of a " large , well dressed man " who had slipped from a cab on Fifth Ave. , ostensibly to change a $20 bill , and never returned . <P> Two pages in the Taxi Weekly are a power for good conduct among Manhattan cabbies , tabulating penalties meted out in the city 's special Hack Bureau to perpetrators of prevalent hackmen 's peccadillos : driving " with the flag up " ( metre not recording ) ; taking indirect routes ; smoking while carrying passengers ; withholding receipts from employers ; forgetting license badge ; charging an Englishman who undervalued U. S. currency $14 for a $1.40 ride . <P> <P> * NOT lazy .
