txt MISDEEDS IN INDIA . Plea for a Suspension of Judgment Till Inquiry Brings Out All Facts . To the Editor of The New York Times : May I repeat in this country the appeal Lord Sydenham has addressed in The London Times to the British people to suspend judgment in regard to the occurrences in the Punjab in April last until the ' findings of Lord Hunter 's committee are available ? I have not a particle of doubt that Edwin . S. Montagu , the Secretary of State for India , has determined to probe the whole Punjab embroglio to its foundations , and to mete out punishment to those who would be found guilty . I regret very ' much that though wide publicity has been given by a section of ' the American press ; which is notoriously s anti-British to the brutal deeds General Dyer and a few other British officers are alleged  --  to have committed , nothing has . been said about the horrible outrages perpetrated by Indian revolutionaries . Unarmed British officials , civil , military , and commercial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in oil and burned ; English women were insulted- and assaulted , and would have been killed had they not been rescued by loyal Indians ; banks were looted , churches razed to the ground , missionary schools destroyed , telegraphic wires cut , and public and private business brought to a standstill . A ' mutiny seemed imminent . ? What it would ' have meant to the British and loyal Indians is known only to him who knows India Well . Far be it from me that I should say a word of condonation of the crime General Dyer is reported to have committed , but I ? venture ' to ' assert that the least sign of weakness or clemency shown bY the British authorities in the Punjab at that- particular time would have been misunderstood by the people of the province and would have led to bloodshed ' and carnage the like of which india has never ez:perienced . Another matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the American public in this connection is that the recent occurrences in the Punjab were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India . There has been orderly and humane Government , bringing in . its train peace and prosperity , justice and liberty , ever since the Government of India was transferred from the East India Company to the British Crown in 1838 . Some of your contemporaries have poured out vials of wrath upon the head of the British Indian Government , and torrents of sympathy- upon - that of the Indian people , because a few boys were whipped in public . But these newly discovered friends of India betray complete ignorance of Oriental : ways and methods , Indian customs and traditions . One of the most harmless , and at the same time the most deterrent punishments meted out to an Indian schoolboy is public flogging . It is in vogue even now in the States ruled and managed by Indian Rajahs . The Western methods are not always the most suitable methods for Eastern peoples .

New York Times : Father Giovanni Semerla , the well-known Italian priest , who is at present in this country , on a mission of charity , says that there are . in Italy 200,000 orphans whose fathers died not for Italy alone but for all the Allies . ' The father appeals for support of these children , for whom it is intended to open little homes where they will be cared for and properly educated . Father Semerla was military- Chaplain of General Cadorna and has preached to nearly every soldier in the Italian Army . His visit to America is ' also as a journalist , and it Is his desire to make the American people better known to his compatriots , but it is especially on behalf of the war orphans of his country that he is here , and , I hope that his mission will not be in vain . MARCHESE GUISCARDO ZACCARIA , New York . ' Jan. 31 , 1920 . The Post Office as Library . To the Editor of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late war , of the general public to the call for books for our soldiers leads me to renew a suggestion I. made some years ago to the Postmaster General . This was not a call for books for soldiers , hut for the general public itself , in the following way : There are in the United States a very great number of Fourth Class Pont Offices , most of them situated in localities where books are difficult , often impossible , to obtain . and yet the inhabitants need reading matter , especially in the Winter season , as badly as did the soldiers in their camps : perhaps the need is even greater , because this condition is a permanent one. - My suggestion was , and it is the same now , that the Fourth Class Post Office should be made a public library as well , with the Postmaster filling the office of librarian . This duty would be very light , for there would not be a large number of books to take care of , and all that.would be asked of the borrowers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or suffer the penalty of a slight fine  --  the method in vogue in most small libraries . The Fourth Class Post Office would have a " book shelf " of ; say , 100 books , provided by the Government or by the people of the whole country , as in the case of the camp libraries . Every two weeks twenty of the books would be forwarded by parcel post to the next Post Office of the same class , and the sending office in turn would receive twenty books from another Post Office . Thus the shelf of 100 books would be constantly changing and every ton weeks would find no book on the shelf that was there originally unless some one desired specially to retain a book . In case duplicates were received such duplicates would immediately he sent on by parcel post , from office to office , till they found a place . By proper planning at the start such a scheme as I have outlined could be made to operate easily and with very little trouble for any one ; and it would bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library . F. S.
