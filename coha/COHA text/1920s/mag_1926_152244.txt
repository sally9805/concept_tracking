REFUSES PULITZER PRIZE <P> All the newspapers ran the slug on their front pages ; it was almost as important an announcement as if a prizefighter , for publicity purposes , had refused a championship title . Not quite so important ; the prizefighter would have got an extra , but the man whose solemn , blunt features appeared under the slug had certainly derived as much attention as he could expect from a purely intellectual issue . It was , of course , Sinclair Lewis ; he had refused the Pulitzer Prize of $1,000 awarded to him for Arrowsmith . <P> He made his formal rejection in a letter to Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler , chairman of the Pulitzer Advisory Board , in which he stated that all prizes are dangerous , that good manners in a novel are more important than literary merit as qualification for the prize , that novelists had better refuse the Pulitzer Prize unless they want its administrators to become a supreme intellectual court , impossible to challenge , like the French Academy . Sophisticates perused these reasons and put on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but the real reason is . . . " And then they murmured that explanatory , vastly inclusive word , " publicity . " <P> Other sophisticates , with an equally wise air , undertook to deny that Mr. Lewis refused the prize to advertise himself . They pointed out that he was quite consistent in refusing it just as he refused election , some years ago , to the National Institute of Arts and Letters . He had some reason for objecting to the terms under which the prize is given : <P> " To the American novel published during the year which shall best present the wholesome atmosphere of American life , and the highest standard of American manners and manhood . " <P> If the board of awards observed this proviso , the Rollo Books might , be more eligible than anything produced by Mr. Lewis . There was at least a 50:50 chance , his defenders claimed , that he had been quite honest . He is a man without taste ; that was clearly demonstrated when he recently invited God to strike him dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But his books have shown just as clearly that he is neither a stupid man nor a poseur . Whether , this time , he were sincere or not , nobody could decide , but everyone said something or other : <P> Nicholas Murray Butler : " I have not yet read the letter ... I do not want to discuss it . " <P> Arthur M. Howe , editor of the Brooklyn Eagle and member of the board : " He did the honest thing in refusing the prize . " <P> Agnes Repplier , essayist : " Interesting and wholesome event . " <P> A nameless author : " The Pulitzer prize is a very silly thing . Prizes given to reporters , cartoonists , editorial writers , advertisers have some relevance because they bring to public notice fine work which would otherwise be forgotten , but a prize given to a well-known novel , play , poem , has the effect of making people think of that piece of work as " the best . " There is no best . Nor is the prize money much help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him only after he has achieved some major success ; and to give a man $1,000 for a novel that has probably earned fifty times that sum makes one think of John D. Rockefeller 's way of rewarding policemen , children and employes with new silver dimes . Mr. Lewis did quite well to throw his dime away .
