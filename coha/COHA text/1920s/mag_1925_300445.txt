Miss Gather s Clear Native Metaphor for Middle-Age <P> The Story . Professor Godfrey St. Peter was a vigorous , expressive man . He swam strongly and often in Lake Michigan . His lectures had the stimulating effect of an exploring mind . His reputation in European History was established , his work on the Spanish adventurers in the Southwest was receiving wide and authoritative approval , he was in love with his wife . <P> But he had known Tom Outland . <P> That had been an experience more searching and fundamental than loving a woman , siring children or writing histories . The boy was an orphan who had grown up , big-boned , quiet , and self-reliant , in New Mexico . He had learned Latin from a Belgian priest , life from railroad men . He told St. Peter about a prehistoric city of the cliff-dwellers that he had discovered , perfectly preserved in the high , dry atmosphere of an inaccessible mesa . He had explored the place thoroughly and gone to Washington , where he was received with scant courtesy and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his absence , St. Peter had visited the place with Tom and felt strongly how , having no strong bonds with the present , the boy was at one with the fine dead race that had set its city on a lofty rock-shelf of a box canyon . In later years , the time of this book , after Tom had died in France , St. Peter found that memories of the mesa filled the depths of his nature with a sacred finality . <P> When his wife moved their belongings into the new house he had been able to give her , St. Peter renewed the lease on their old abode and retained as his study the chilly , inconvenient third-floor cubicle that had served him for years . He was a tolerant man but a desire was growing upon him to avoid his family , to be alone and do nothing . Their solicitude stifled him . His Jewish son-in-law 's florid devotion to the memory of Tom Outland-whom he had never known but whose inventions , willed to Rosamond St. Peter , had made him rich-was an affront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The florid son-in-law took Rosamond and the professor 's wife abroad ; St. Peter escaped the jaunt with difficulty . He edited Outland s diary of the year in the cliff city , wrote a foreword and lay through long thoughtful evenings on his old box couch , covered with Tom 's Navajo saddle-blanket . There was a high wind the night he had a cable from his returning wife , blew out the gas in the leaky heater . St. Peter smelled the room filling and wondered if he was obliged to save his life , now that it seemed so completed . He thought not and lay still . <P> The household machinery was already in motion , however , and a faithful cog , the seamstress , dragged him out alive . St. Peter philosophically readjusted himself to live out an anticlimax.
