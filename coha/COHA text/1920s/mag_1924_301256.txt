M. Agre , antiquary of Robaix , France , bought of a grand nephew of Henri Robelin , auctioneer of the Drouet Salesrooms under Napoleon III , a collection of 15 presumably worthless paintings . On looking them over , he was rather impressed by one canvas , ten by seven inches , and on cleaning it found the signature " P. P. Rubens . " M. Agre promptly sent the painting to the well-known Rubens authority , Prof. Tuguyne of the Brussels Art School , who pronounced the picture genuine . The painting , depicting Venus and a faun , is now held for 1,000,000 francs .
