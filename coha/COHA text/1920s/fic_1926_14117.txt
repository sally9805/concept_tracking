The curtain rises , disclosing a scene in the courtyard , or atrium , in the home of Fabius Maximus in Rome . It is early evening , just before sunset , of a June day in the year 216 B. C. The house , which surrounds the courtyard on all three sides , is one story in height . It is simple and unostentatious in design , being representative of Rome in the period of the Republic , when the sterner virtues of economy and almost Spartan frugality were practised . There are four entrances : one ( downstage right ) which leads to the kitchens and slave quarters ; another ( upstage right ) which leads to the street  --  this being the main entrance to the house ; a third ( downstage left ) which leads to the sleeping quarters , and a fourth ( upstage left ) which leads , through a passageway , to the street . The scene is divided in half , laterally , by a row of columns . Over the front part of the stage is stretched a painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrium is open , the blue Italian sky being visible above the rear wall of the house . In this open space is a small pool ; flowers and shrubs are growing in earthenware pots ; there is a shrine in a niche in the rear wall . At the right , in the foreground , is a table , with three chairs and a stool . Behind it , against the columns , is a sort of serving-table on which are goblets , bowls , pitchers , etc . At the left is another chair and a bench . When the curtain rises , VARIUS , a slave , is engaged in setting the table for the evening meal . He is a fair young man , obviously not a Latin , with the air of one who has known better circumstances than these . He is supremely contemptuous of his Roman masters , and inclined to be rebellious . VARIUS pours some wine into a goblet , peers about cautiously to make sure that he is unobserved , and then tastes the wine . VARIUS ( Calling off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we anything better in the house ? p. 3 META ( Off stage ) No . That 's all we have . ( META , a slim , lovely young girl , enters D. R. , bearing a tray of food , which she deposits on the table . ) VARIUS I wish they 'd hurry up and settle this war so that we could have something decent to eat and drink . META ( Gets two cups from upstage table , places them on downstage table , gets wine jar , pours wine ) It 's not for a slave to criticize his master 's wine . VARIUS ( Sitting down at the table ) Oh , I know it  --  but I 'm fed up with keeping my place . ( She catches his eye and he stands up , hastily . ) META Perhaps I 'm fed up , too , Varius . Being a slave in Rome is n't quite the pleasantest occupation imaginable But I should like to know what 's to be done about it . VARIUS Salves sometimes escape . META ( Alarmed ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must n't dare to try that . You know what the chances are . If you were caught , it would mean instant death ! VARIUS Would n't you prefer death to this ? p. 4 META ( Moving downstage ) No  --  I ca n't say that I would . VARIUS You 're better off than I am . You 're close to her . She gives you some sympathy . She understands . META She understands us because she 's an alien herself . VARIUS Yes , and in Rome the attitude toward all aliens is , " If you do n't like it here , why do n't you go back where you came from , " knowing damned well that we ca n't . META ( After putting jug on table , gets cloth and wipes table ) Cheer up , Varius . ( She puts her arm about him and strokes his hair ) It might have been worse  --  it might have been much worse . Suppose we had been separated when they captured us ? VARIUS I know . But why ca n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our natural impulses ? We belong to each other  --  but we ca n't have each other , because we 're slaves ! META In Rome , it 's wise for a slave to forget that he is a human being . VARIUS If you were n't here , I might be able to forget it . ( He takes her in his arms ) But when I look at you , I ca n't remember anything  --  except that I love you . p. 5 META And I love you , Varius . I shall always love you . ( She backs away from him , nervously . ) VARIUS ( Vehemently  --  up to grill , looks off R. ) We must escape , Meta ! We must get away from Rome , and be free ! META ( Crosses up L. to grill ) We ca n't get away from Rome , Varius . Rome is everywhere . Rome will soon be the whole world . VARIUS If we could only reach Apulia , we could join with the Carthaginians . META Even that 's hopeless . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master say that he expected news of Hannibal 's defeat any day ? VARIUS The master does n't always know what he 's talking about . META Of course he does n't know what he 's talking about ! He 's not supposed to . He 's a Senator . But I could n't go and leave her . She needs us , Varius . She 's bored to death in Rome . VARIUS She ca n't be blamed for that . META We 're her only friends . She clings to us . VARIUS ( Excitedly ) Perhaps she 'd escape with us ! p. 6 META If she knew of any way of escape from Rome , she would have taken it herself , long ago . Now please put the thought out of your mind , Varius . We ca n't escape  --  ever . VARIUS There must be some way out for us . ( She kisses him tenderly . ) ( FABIA comes in suddenly from the sleeping-quarters at the left downstage , and gasps , with horrified indignation , at the sight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fabius  --  a cross , narrow-minded old lady , whose world is her home . For all her seventy-three years , she is brisk and vigorous , and she rules the establishment with an iron hand . ) FABIA ( Astounded at this breach ) What on earth do you two think you 're doing ? ( Hastily they separate , with sheepish self-consciousness . ) Why , I never heard of such loose , shocking conduct  --  never in all my life . How dare you kiss each other  --  right here in the atrium , of all places ? I do n't look for much delicacy among slaves , but you know as well as I do that this sort of thing is not tolerated . You 'll be punished for this . META ( Abjectly ) We 're very sorry that it happened , my lady . FABIA ( Crosses down C. ) I declare , you slaves are becoming more insolent every day . You 're a problem , that 's what you are . How dare you insult your master 's house with such conduct ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my lady . It 's an old custom in our country . FABIA Oh , it is , is it ? Well , you 're not in your country now . You 're in Rome ! Furthermore , you 're slaves . ( Crosses to L. end of table ) If the people in your country had spent less time making love , and more at good , honest , hard work , perhaps our Roman armies would n't have conquered you so easily . META Yes , my lady . FABIA Is dinner ready ? ( Latch is heard offstage R. FABIUS enters up R. , crosses well upstage behind grill and enters atrium up L. ) META It is , my lady . FABIA See that it 's nicely served . ( Crosses down L. ) And I do n't care to hear of any more love- making in this house . Do you understand ? VARIUS We do , my lady  --  perfectly . META ( To VARIUS ) The master ! ( FABIUS is a typical Senator  --  pompous , unctuous , consciously important and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered , as it were , from the eminence of the rostrum . He is not , however , just an old wind-bag  --  inflated , for purposes of this play , merely to be punctured . On the contrary , he should convey a definite sense of authority , distinction and real power . He is , at the moment , at the head of the Roman state ; he must " fit the pictureframe. " ) p. 8 FABIA Ah , my poor son ! ( She anxiously scans his face . Kisses him ) You look tired . FABIUS MAXIMUS Yes , mother . I 've had a hard day at the Forum . ( He sinks down on the chair at the left downstage ; ties laces to sandals . META and VARIUS go out at D.R. ) These are trying times , mother , trying times . Rome faces a grave crisis . FABIA ( Sits bench L. ) What is the crisis now , my son ? FABIUS MAXIMUS The people are worried about Hannibal . He has the most irritating habit of winning victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance . There is a demand in the Senate for positive action . FABIA Oh , do n't listen to these old senators . They 're always talking . Talk  --  talk  --  talk ! That 's all they know how to do . ( VARIUS enters down R. to set table . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS To-day the Senators really accomplished something , mother  --  something big . FABIA What did they do ? Send out another army ? ( META enters quietly from D.R. , carrying a pitcher of water. ) p. 9 FABIUS MAXIMUS No , mother , I am proud to say that they recognized your son 's long and not undistinguished career as a public servant of Rome . FABIA ( Excitedly ) They promoted you ? FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Rising  --  crosses to C. ) They proclaimed me Dictator , with full power to conduct the state and the armies as I see fit . FABIA My boy ! The Dictator of all Rome . ( She smothers him with congratulatory caresses ) You have brought new glory to the Fabian name . You are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slaves ) Here , you slaves ! Do you realize the honor that has come to our house ? Your master is Dictator of all Rome . ( The two slaves bow politely . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Deprecatingly , sits bench L. ) Oh , come , come , mother . I 'm afraid it is n't quite so much as all that . Just a wartime measure of expediency . FABIA ( She is C. ) Ah  --  but you are modest . You begrudge yourself the satisfaction of knowing that all Rome must bow before you now . ( She contemplates the possibilities ) When I walk out into the streets of the city , everyone  --  even the best families  --  will bow before me , and say , " She is the mother of Fabius Maximus , the Dictator of all Rome . " ( Crosses to him. ) p. 10 FABIUS MAXIMUS My dear , loyal mother . ( He pats her hand patronizingly ) I 'm rather anxious to see how Amytis takes this bit of news . ( FABIA 'S brow clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( META to table with bread ) I hurried home from the Forum to tell her about it . Where is she ? FABIA She should have been here long ago . It is past the hour of dinner . FABIUS MAXIMUS Meta , where is your mistress ? META She 's down at the market-place with Cato . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Rising ) At the market-place ? What for ? META There is a merchant there , lately arrived from Antioch . FABIUS MAXIMUS From Antioch , eh ? What business has he in Rome ? ( Up across C. ) VARIUS ( Upstage of table ) I think he came here in the hope that he might make some money . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Crosses below table ) Or perhaps to pick up some valuable information . Antioch and Carthage are close allies . He may even be spreading Carthaginian propaganda . I 'll run the fellow out of town . p. 11 FABIA ( Crosses slowly upstage of table ) You can do it , Fabius . You 're the Dictator ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ META holds out to him , drying them with the towl which she also offers . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS It does n't look well for my wife to be patronizing a dirty , foreign peddler . I wish she 'd come home . ( Sits R. of table . ) FABIA Perhaps we 'd better start dinner and not wait for her . ( Washes hands . FABIUS and FABIA sit down at the table and start eating . VARIUS goes out D.R. with towel and pitcher . FABIA leans over to speak to FABIUS , confidentially ) I 'm very much worried about those slaves . They 're becoming more and more insolent all the time . FABIUS MAXIMUS In what way ? FABIA Just now , I caught them making love FABIUS MAXIMUS Making love ? FABIA They were kissing each other ! ( META , realizing that she is not supposed to overhear this conversation , tactfully goes out D.R. ) FABIUS MAXIMUS I hope you spoke to them about it . p. 12 FABIA I reprimanded them  --  but not so severely as I should . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tray to serving table . Enter VARIUS D.R. with pitcher and tray to table . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS Why no ? FABIA Because  --  ( The door bolt U.R . is heard again )  --  they 're continually being encouraged to violate the rules of discipline . FABIUS MAXIMUS By whom ? ( AMYTIS enters from the right , upstage . She is followed by CATO , a slave , who carries garments and materials of brilliant colors . On CATO 'S arms are ( 1 ) green cloth , ( 2 ) green dress later worn , ( 3 ) gold cloth , ( 4 ) white night gown , which is on top . ) FABIA ( With a gesture toward AMYTIS ) By her ! ( AMYTIS is young , beautiful , gracious , and obviously civilized . She has an air of culture , sophistication , and refinement that is not evident in any of the Romans . Her mother was an Athenian Greek  --  her father a Roman officer  --  and within her are combined the worthiest characteristics of these two widely contrasted races : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the more serious problems with which her distinguished husband is continually wrestling ; but behind this surface artificiality are profound depths of sympathy and understanding . Her external fluffiness and levity are masks for an essential thoughtfulness . She gives the impression , to FABIUS and his friends , that she is weak and inconsequential ; actually , she is strong , and brave and wise. ) p. 13 AMYTIS ( Talking rather fast , comes to up C. ) I 'm so sorry to be late , but there was a merchant from Antioch who had the most fascinating things , and I could n't tear myself away . FABIA Amytis , your husband has some great news for you . AMYTIS ( Not having heard ) Look at this . ( She takes a fragile garment from the slave 's arm and holds it up . ) It 's a Phoenician nightgown , from the Court of Antiochus the Great . The merchant told me that it was made for the emperor 's favorite concubine . FABIUS MAXIMUS Amytis ! There are servants present . AMYTIS ( META @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this piece of material . Is n't it gorgeous ? Is n't it ravishing ? See how it shimmers when you hold it to the light ? No Roman loom could have woven fabric like that ! FABIA ( To FABIUS ) Tell her what happened at the Senate AMYTIS ( Going right ahead , looks at cloth ) I do n't know how I 'll use it just yet , but it 's bound to come in handy some time or other . FABIUS MAXIMUS Amytis , the Roman Senate conferred a singular honor on your husband to-day . p. 14 AMYTIS ( Taking green dress from the slave ) But here 's the real prize  --  a peacock-green dress from Damascus  --  made of silk . Think of it ! Real silk ! ( Passes it to META ) The merchant told me that it came from the farthest reaches of the Orient . It was carried on the backs of camels across the desert  --  " all for you , fair lady "  --  those were his very words . Is n't it beautiful ! ( Returns it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . But do you think  --  do you think it 's quite the sort of thing to be worn by a lady of your position ? AMYTIS My position ? I have no position . I 'm just the wife of an ordinary Roman Senator  --  and , certainly , that does n't mean much . FABIA ( Bristling ) The wife of an ordinary Roman Senator , indeed ! Do you realize what happened in the Senate to-day ? AMYTIS ( Turns to R. ) Now , do n't tell me they passed another law . ( Turns L. to CATO . ) FABIA To-day the Roman Senate proclaimed your husband , Fabius Maximus , Dictator . FABIUS MAXIMUS Yes , my dear , they have placed me at the head of the Roman state . p. 15 AMYTIS Is n't that nice Cato , put those things in my room . Go on with dinner . I 'll be right back . ( She goes out D.L. , with hurried instructions to CATO to " Lay them out on the bed so that I can see them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( VARIUS at serving table . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS She took it calmly . FABIA ( Bitterly ) She does n't understand what it means . After all , she 's only a Greek . ( META crosses to D.R. exit , returns with tray of food . FABIUS resumes his meal . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS You must n't be too hard on Amytis , mother . She has those queer Athenian ideas inbred in her , and she ca n't get rid of them . It is n't her fault . The Athenians know nothing of the principles of government that have made Rome what it is to-day . FABIA Yes  --  and look at Athens now . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Between mouthfuls ) Completely gone to seed . No state can survive unless it is founded on good , sound military strength and a policy of progressive conquest . FABIA Have we conquered Hannibal yet ? p. 16 FABIUS MAXIMUS No , we have n't exactly conquered Hannibal as yet . But he 's on the run . FABIA ( META and VARIUS at table with bowl and pitcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMYTIS comes in D.L. and goes to L. of the table . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS I hope that I shall not be undeserving of my countrymen 's trust . AMYTIS Well  --  what have you two been talking about ? ( As AMYTIS speaks , she dips her fingers in the bowl which VARIUS holds . ) FABIA We 've been talking about Hannibal . FABIUS MAXIMUS I was just telling my mother that we have him on the run . AMYTIS Everyone seems to be talking about Hannibal these days , and I 'm sick and tired of the sound of his name . ( AMYTIS sits L. of table . META exits D.R. ) By the way , who is he ? ( FABIUS and FABIA are astounded at this confession of ignorance . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS My dear Amytis  --  you 're not serious ? ( VARIUS exits D.R. with pitcher and bowl. ) p. 17 AMYTIS Why not ? How should I know who Hannibal is ? I 'm not a member of the Senate . FABIUS MAXIMUS Amytis  --  Hannibal is the arch-enemy of Rome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctity of our homes . AMYTIS Where does he come from ? FABIUS MAXIMUS From Carthage . AMYTIS Really . I 've heard that Carthage is a very beautiful city . FABIUS MAXIMUS Quite possibly . But Carthage happens to be at war with Rome , and Hannibal is in command . AMYTIS Now , Fabius , please do n't ask me to keep track of our wars , or just who our enemies happen to be at the moment . With one war after another  --  and sometimes two or three wars at a time  --  I ca n't follow them . The mental effort is too great . FABIUS MAXIMUS Perhaps you 'd take a more lively interest if Hannibal marched into Rome , with his army of Africans and Spaniards and Gauls . How would you like to see this house burned down about you , and your loved ones slaughtered before your eyes ? Would that amuse you ? AMYTIS It might serve to break the monotony of life in Rome . FABIA I have lived in Rome for seventy-three years . I have not found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you must remember that you 're never been anywhere else . I had the misfortune to be born in Athens , where gaiety is not listed among the unpardonable sins . FABIA It was bad luck for you that your mother married a Roman officer . FABIUS MAXIMUS Sometimes I wish that you had inherited more of your father 's traits . AMYTIS Perhaps I did . Perhaps my Athenian frivolousness is purely superficial . Perhaps , in the depths of my soul , I am a stern , relentless , world-beating Roman ! FABIUS MAXIMUS I 'm afraid I know nothing about the depths of your soul , Amytis . AMYTIS ( Laughs ) I 'm afraid you do n't . FABIUS MAXIMUS You 'll never believe that I am in sympathy with you . AMYTIS The trouble with me is  --  I 'm bored . And I do n't like it . Being bored is so  --  so snobbish . FABIA It is your own fault if you are bored . There are many subjects of interest in Rome . FABIUS MAXIMUS My mother is right , Amytis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . Why , just consider the population figures . Ten years ago p. 19 AMYTIS That 's just it . Rome is too busily engaged in the great work of expanding to think about such trivial matters as happiness or even contentment . If we could only stop being successful for a while  --  if we could only lose a war , now and then , just for the sake of variety FABIUS MAXIMUS Our community life is well organized . Why do n't you associate with the wives of my friends ? AMYTIS Now , really , Fabius , you know that Senators themselves are dull ; you ought to know that , having to listen to them make speeches all day . But even Senators are marvels of intellectual brilliance compared to their wives . FABIA ( With obvious scorn ) Yes , I 've noticed that you do n't care to associate with ladies of the better class . You seem to prefer the companionship of slaves . FABIUS MAXIMUS Come now , mother . We need n't mention that . AMYTIS Fabius FABIUS MAXIMUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere this evening ? FABIUS MAXIMUS Go out ? Where ? AMYTIS Oh , just somewhere . To a play , perhaps p. 20 FABIA I see no occasion for going to a play . FABIUS MAXIMUS Is there a play ? AMYTIS I believe there is . There 's a company of players here ; they come from Athens FABIUS MAXIMUS Oh ! I 've heard about them . AMYTIS They 're giving " Oedipus Rex . " FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Incredulously ) And you want to see " Oedipus Rex " ? FABIA Porbably one of the coarsest plays ever written ! AMYTIS Oh , but I love it ! I adore a good , exciting tragedy . FABIUS MAXIMUS But why ? AMYTIS I love to cry . I like to go into the theatre and just sob . FABIA ( Horrified ) But " Oedipus Rex " AMYTIS What 's wrong with that ? FABIUS MAXIMUS Well , to tell you the truth , Amytis , I 've never seen the play  --  but I 've heard that it 's  --  well , that it 's rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that until you 've seen it yourself . p. 21 FABIUS MAXIMUS Well , my dear , I 'm afraid I ca n't go out again . FABIA Of course you ca n't , my poor boy . You 're terribly tired . AMYTIS Then please may I go , anyway ? FABIA Alone ? AMYTIS Why not ? FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Hastily ) That would n't do at all , my dear . I could never consent to that . AMYTIS Then what are we to do this evening  --  just sit around ? FABIUS MAXIMUS No , I shall not just " sit around . " I am worn out . I shall go to bed presently . AMYTIS That will be fun . ( FABIA strikes gong . ) ( VARIUS and META enter D.R. VARIUS carries pitcher and towel . META gets bowl from serving table . They come down R. of table , between FABIUS and FABIA . FABIUS washes first , then FABIA ; after which pitcher and bowl are put back on serving table . ) FABIA Varius , you can clear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Belligerently ) Did you expect anything more ? p. 22 AMYTIS ( Vaguely ) I did n't know FABIA Of course you did n't know . How could you know ? You never take the trouble to order the meals . AMYTIS I 'm no good at housekeeping . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( With characteristic diplomacy ) There 's no reason why Amytis should attend to the housekeeping , Mother  --  not while you do it so well . FABIA ( With elaborate scorn ) Oh , I would n't expect her to do any work around the house . Oh , no ! But it is n't for her to complain . AMYTIS I only wanted something sweet . There does n't seem to be any dessert . FABIA Here ! Eat a grape . ( She thrusts the bowl of grapes toward AMYTIS , who bites one and makes a wry face . Exit D.R. ) ( Start here clearing table . ( 1 ) META removes AMYTIS ' tray  --  hands it to VARIUS , who exits D.R. Leave wine cup for SCIPIO. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S tray and mug , gives it to VARIUS , who exits D.R. ( 3 ) Reenter VARIUS . META takes FABIUS ' tray and mug and gives it to VARIUS , who exits D.R. ( 4 ) META takes gong and mallet to upstage table  --  then bread  --  then puts bowl and towel on downstage table . ( 5 ) Grapes are not moved till later . ( 6 ) META takes bread and exits D.R. ) p. 23 FABIUS MAXIMUS You do n't realize that this is wartime , my dear . We have to deny ourselves some of the luxuries , for the sake of our brave boys at the front . AMYTIS Is that why there 's no dessert ? FABIUS MAXIMUS Yes . This is sweetless Saturday . ( Cross up C. The meal is now over . The two slaves have cleared the table and gone out . When FABIUS and AMYTIS are alone  --  FABIUS looks to see everyone is out ) It is always difficult for me to talk to you , Amytis . Sometimes I feel that you and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  eating grapes ) Are you angry with me because I spent so much money in the market-place ? FABIUS MAXIMUS No  --  it is n't that  --  although , I must say , that Phoenician nightgown seems a little  --  perhaps  --  AMYTIS Indecent ? What of it ? None of the Senators will see me in that , will they ? I bought that in the hope that it might be just the least bit stimulating to you . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Embarrassed but pleased ) Yes , yes , of course  --  and then that green dress  --  the one that the camels carried  --  do you intend to wear that in the streets of Rome ? p. 24 AMYTIS Of course . It will make all the women in Rome envious , and cause them to complain to their husbands that the wife of Fabius Maximus is not quite respectable . FABIUS MAXIMUS But that 's what we must avoid . We ca n't afford to have that sort of talk going on . Do n't forget that you are now the first citizeness of Rome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought , the ultimate authority in all matters relating to feminine deportment . FABIUS MAXIMUS Of course , of course . You are the Dictator 's wife  --  and for that very reason you are expected to set a good example in all the more desirable virtues . AMYTIS Such as ? FABIUS MAXIMUS Well  --  ah  --  respectability , modesty , economy , devotion to duty  --  reverence , chastity AMYTIS And mediocrity ! I see ! FABIUS MAXIMUS It is in the best interests of the state as a whole . Do you understand ? AMYTIS I understand perfectly , and I shall do my best to be a model of all that is most virtuous and most thoroughly uninteresting . FABIUS MAXIMUS And there is one thing more , Amytis. p. 25 AMYTIS I suppose I am to be more regular in my attendance at the temple . FABIUS MAXIMUS That goes without saying . What I wished particularly was to influence you to take a more lively interest in public affairs . For instance , I was shocked to learn that you know nothing of Hannibal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember , you confessed to me the other day that you had never heard of Aristotle . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Down R. below bench ) That 's quite true , my dear . But , after all , you must admit that Aristotle never did anything to make himself famous . AMYTIS What has Hannibal done ? Has he contributed anything to the advancement of science or philosophy or art ? FABIUS MAXIMUS I 'm afraid not . But he has led an army of foot-soldiers , cavalry , and elephants from Africa to Spain , from Spain to Gaul , across the Alps and into Italy  --  a distance of over three thousand miles . Hannibal is cruel , he is treacherous , he is a menace to our Roman civilization , but he is a great soldier . We must be generous and afford him that . AMYTIS ( Up  --  dips hand in bowl  --  dries them  --  sits on downstage edge of table ) You say he is cruel . Is there any soldier who is otherwise ? p. 26 FABIUS MAXIMUS Hannibal has spread destruction wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed crops , butchered men , and despoiled women . AMYTIS That is the immemorial privilege of the conqueror FABIUS MAXIMUS Hannibal has taken undue advantage of that privilege . ( Crosses R.C. ; sits on stool below table ) Last winter , when his army was quartered in Cis-Alpine Gaul , there was a veritable epidemic of pregnancy . AMYTIS Good for Hannibal ! He sounds like a thoroughly commendable person . FABIUS MAXIMUS Amytis ! Please do n't say such things , even in fun . AMYTIS Why not ? Is it wrong for me to admire good , old-fashioned virility in men ? I certainly have n't seen any too much of it in my own life . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Falteringly ) What do you mean ? AMYTIS Fabius , you know perfectly well what I mean . FABIUS MAXIMUS I wish you would n't harp on that subject , Amytis . I 've been working hard lately . I 've had so many worries . It 's the state that demands all my time  --  all my energy . p. 27 AMYTIS Of course  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , and the state 's business , and the state 's public brawls FABIUS MAXIMUS We can have no other thought until Rome rules the world . AMYTIS When that happens , I suppose the orgies will start . FABIUS MAXIMUS The splendid morale of the Roman people will never weaken . AMYTIS Morale  --  there 's no such thing in Rome . There 's nothing here but a narrow-minded , hypocritical morality . You Romans call it godliness ; it 's nothing but worldliness , of the most selfish , material kind . FABIUS MAXIMUS Amytis ! I ca n't bear to hear you talk that way . It  --  it 's cruel . AMYTIS Oh  --  I 'm sorry , Fabius . I do n't mean to hurt you . Do n't pay any attention to the things I say . My ideas do n't fit in Rome , anyway . ( She strokes his hair . He is easily mollified . ) Now ! Go ahead and tell me all about your success in the Senate , and whatever it was they made you to-day . FABIUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all Rome . I control everything . AMYTIS Everything except Hannibal . p. 28 FABIUS MAXIMUS I 'll have him under control before long . His head will be mounted on a spear in the center of the market-place , as a warning to all those who lack faith in the glorious destiny of Rome  --  ( Up . AMYTIS is sitting on the edge of the table and FABIUS on the stool before it . Toward the end of the preceding speech , FABIUS , warming to his subject , starts to rise with finger pointed upward in a characteristically oratorical gesture . AMYTIS places her hands on his shoulders and gently pushes him down again , murmuring , " Now , Fabius , would you mind sitting down , dear ? " ) AMYTIS And you , my husband , will accomplish all this ? FABIUS MAXIMUS Yes , the gods of Rome have called upon me to conquer the ruthless African invader , who has trampled our virgin soil under the dread heel of oppression . ( Again FABIUS starts of rise . ) AMYTIS Fabius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puts him down again ) Did you use that line in your speech of acceptance ? FABIUS MAXIMUS Yes , I believe I did voice some such sentiments . AMYTIS And the Forum rocked with applause , I 'm sure . FABIUS MAXIMUS I 'm happy to say that my remarks were well received . After I had spoken , all the leaders of the Senate clustered around me to congratulate me . Would you like to know what else I said ? p. 29 AMYTIS Of course I should . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Standing up and achieving an attitude ) I said : " Fellow Romans " AMYTIS Fabius , I want you to sit down . ( She pushes him in chair . He rises again at once and crosses L. as she laughs uproariously . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS I called attention to our policy of delay , which has worried Hannibal and forced him to take up a defensive position in Agulia , two hundred miles from Rome . We have him in a trap . Furthermore , our army outnumbers his by two to one . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morale is better ! AMYTIS I can just hear the cheers . FABIUS MAXIMUS The time has come for us to strike  --  and to strike hard ! AMYTIS Poor Hannibal ! After travelling three thousand miles , he has to die ingloriously and be exhibited in the market-place as a horrible lesson to little children . FABIUS MAXIMUS Waste no sympathy on Hannibal , my dear . He courted disaster when he embarked on this foolhardy enterprise . AMYTIS Why do you suppose he did it ? FABIUS MAXIMUS He wished to destroy Rome . p. 30 AMYTIS But why ? What has Hannibal against Rome ? FABIUS MAXIMUS He knows that unless he first destroys Rome , Rome will ultimately destroy Carthage . AMYTIS That seems rather silly . FABIUS MAXIMUS It may seem silly to you , my dear . The feminine mind can never comprehend the true significance of war . AMYTIS Other women do . ( Upstage of chair L. of table , turns back of chair to audience ) Whenever one of our armies start out , all the wives and mothers and sweethearts cheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting battles and spreading Roman civilization with the sword , the womenfolk sit at home and talk about the great sacrifices they 're making . I 've heard them . ( She sits down in chair , L. of the table . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Crosses up C. ) I 'm happy to say that the women of Rome have always rallied splendidly in the hour of peril  --  and I mean no offense to you , my dear . You just do n't understand what war is . AMYTIS Fabius FABIUS MAXIMUS Yes , dear ? AMYTIS How old is Hannibal ? p. 31 FABIUS MAXIMUS He 's just a young man  --  thirty years of age , or thereabouts . AMYTIS How tragic ! FABIUS MAXIMUS Why tragic ? AMYTIS I was thinking how wasteful it is to sacrifice a young man who has the genius to lead a troop of elephants across the Alps . Just think  --  if he he were allowed to live , some day he might do something useful . FABIUS MAXIMUS If he were allowed to live , Amytis , he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you , my husband , are to be celebrated throughout all history as the man who conquered Hannibal and saved Rome . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Greatly pleased ) Yes , my dear  --  I suppose I shall be accorded some measure of recognition . ( Paces up and down , posing . There is a slight pause , during which AMYTIS gazes off dreamily into space . ) What are you thinking about now , my dear ? AMYTIS I was just wondering what it would be like to be despoiled . FABIUS MAXIMUS Amytis ! Is that a proper subject for a lady 's thoughts ? AMYTIS Not proper , perhaps  --  but certainly not unusual . p. 32 FABIUS MAXIMUS You 'd know soon enough , if Hannibal 's army ever marched into Rome . AMYTIS I suppose there are no chances of that FABIUS MAXIMUS No chances whatever , I 'm happy to say . AMYTIS Are there any women in Rome who have had the misfortune to encounter Hannibal 's army ? FABIUS MAXIMUS Oh , yes  --  we have a great many refugees in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to ask some of them up to dinner some time . Their comments might be interesting . FABIUS MAXIMUS Hannibal will be made to pay for his atrocities . ( From the far distance , a bugle call is heard  --  a shrill , weird , barbaric sound . AMYTIS starts as she hears it , and looks up curiously . ) AMYTIS What was that ? FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Yawning ) Oh , probably some shepherd  --  ( FABIA enters D.R. )  --  bringing his flocks in from the fields . ( FABIUS sits down wearily at the left on bench , yawns . ) FABIA ( Crosses to FABIUS ) Fabius , my son , you are tired . You must go to bed and rest . Remember that every ounce of your vigor must be conserved . ( VARIUS enters D.R. , takes stool upstage of table and places up by C. column and quickly exits D.R. ) p. 33 AMYTIS Yes , Fabius  --  you must conserve your vigor . FABIA For now you belong to Rome . FABIUS MAXIMUS Very well , mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He rises and goes to AMYTIS , L. of table . ) AMYTIS Good-night , Fabius , and do n't be too annoyed at my ignorance . I 'll try to learn . And when Hannibal 's head is mounted in the marketplace , I shall be there to jeer at his sad face . FABIUS MAXIMUS Of course you will , Amytis . For all your talk , you 're just as patriotic as any one . Is n't she , mother ? FABIA ( Down L. , without enthusiasm ) I 'm sure she is . FABIUS MAXIMUS Good-night , Amytis , my love . ( He kisses AMYTIS and crosses to FABIA ) Good-night , mother dear . ( He starts to go out D.L. At the door he pauses and turns ) Some day , perhaps , we 'll all go to a play . ( He goes out D.L. ) FABIA But it will not be " Oedipus Rex . " ( She addresses AMYTIS ) Are you going to bed ? ( AMYTIS does n't answer . ) Are you going to bed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'll stay out here for a while . The air is very pleasant . FABIA I advise you to put something around your shoulders . Good night . ( Crosses up L. to look off . ) AMYTIS Good-night , mother  --  and sweet dreams to you . ( FABIA goes out down L. META and VARIUS come in timidly from D.R. AMYTIS still sitting L. of table . ) META ( VARIUS upstage of table  --  META crosses up C. ) My lady Varius and I would like to go for a little walk . May we ? AMYTIS Of course you may . I wish I could go with you  --  but I 'm afraid it would n't look quite right . VARIUS ( Smiling  --  joins META up C. ) I 'm afraid not , my lady . AMYTIS You two would like to be married , would n't you ? VARIUS Yes , my lady , we would . Our fathers destined us for each other when we were small children . META ( Hastily ) But it 's out of the question now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't allowed to marry in Rome . That 's one of our best laws . VARIUS Might I speak to you , my lady META ( Sensing his purpose  --  turns to him ) No , Varius  --  you must n't AMYTIS Why , of course you may , Varius . VARIUS We want to get away META ( Terrified ) Please do n't say it VARIUS ( Desperately ) We want to be free . AMYTIS ( Caressingly ) You want to be free ! META ( Turns to AMYTIS ) We know it ca n't be done , my lady . ( Angrily , turns to VARIUS ) Varius  --  you 're a fool to say these things . AMYTIS Not at all , Meta . You and Varius can say anything you please  --  to me . You need n't be afraid that I 'll tell ( She glances toward the door D.L. ) anyone . VARIUS Then you 'll help us to escape ? AMYTIS I 'm afraid that 's quite another matter . If I could help you , I would do so . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where can you find freedom ? p. 36 META I told him that , my lady . I told him it was hopeless . But he would blurt this out . ( Kneels in front of AMYTIS . ) VARIUS There are the Carthaginians , my lady . They 're friendly to all enemies of Rome . AMYTIS The Carthaginians themselves will soon be slaves . They 're to be conquered , like all the others who have tried to argue with Roman supremacy Rome ca n't be beaten  --  not yet . There 's an air of destiny about this place , an intimation of empire  --  and it ca n't be subdued . VARIUS Then there is no hope for us ? AMYTIS No . We have the misfortune to be thoughtful people  --  and there 's no place for us in the world , as Rome is organizing it . We have n't that air of destiny , nor the self-confident strength that it gives . Thoughtful people are never very successful . ( AMYTIS up . The distant bugle call is heard again . META rises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there is a sense of vague , suppressed excitement . ) There 's that strange sound again . What is it ? ( A loud knocking is heard at the left upstage . ) See who that is , Varius . VARIUS Yes , my lady . AMYTIS Whoever it is , I 've gone to bed . ( She goes hurriedly into the sleeping quarters at D.L. VARIUS goes out at the left , upstage . He is heard to unbolt and open the door , and then to say offstage , " What is it , Cato ? " CATO replies , excitedly , " You can see them plainly from the walls  --  thousands of our men . " They are both speaking together , and their words are therefore indistinct . VARIUS returns with CATO , an excited youth. ) p. 37 CATO ( TO META  --  C. upstage behind rail ) There are hundreds of camp-fires off to the east . ( VARIUS climbs up one of the columns , the center one , so that he can see over the top of the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Up ladder ) The army must have returned . META But I thought the army was away , fighting Hannibal . CATO They were . This must mean that they 've conquered him , at last . META Poor Hannibal ! ( Another loud knock is heard U.L. ) VARIUS ( Climbing down ) Open the gate , Cato . ( CATO goes out U.L. , and again a confusion of voices is heard  --  CATO saying , " What 's happened , sir ? You 're wounded , " and SCIPIO saying , " Is Fabius here ? I must see Fabius , at once . " SCIPIO comes in , with CATO following . SCIPIO is a handsome young man , wearing the helmet , breastplate , etc. , of a Roman officer . His cloak is torn , dirty and spotted with blood . His left arm is bandaged . He is a fine , upstanding type of soldier  --  earnest , sincere , intense  --  one of the men who aided materially in Rome 's conquest of the world. ) p. 38 SCIPIO ( Steadying himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( VARIUS exits L. into the sleeping quarters . SCIPIO crosses to the table and slumps down wearily into a chair L. of table . META hands him a goblet of wine . SCIPIO removes helmet . VARIUS returns , stands in door L. CATO , above rail , looks on . META removes cup and grapes from table . ) VARIUS We have seen the campfires , sir . Has the army returned ? SCIPIO Some of it has returned . ( VARIUS goes to ladder behind column . FABIUS comes in D.L. , drawing his toga about him . Crosses down L. , below bench . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS Scipio , why are you here ? What does this mean ? SCIPIO It means that the Roman army has suffered a terrible defeat . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Bewildered ) Defeat ? Where ? SCIPIO At Can nae . We were routed  --  disgraced ! ( VARIUS again climbs up the column to look out . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Aghast ) And Hannibal  --  ( Crosses up C. ) Where is he ? p. 39 SCIPIO Hannibal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ladder ) Then those are Hannibal 's camp-fires ! FABIUS MAXIMUS But  --  but it ca n't be ! It 's impossible ! Hannibal is two hundred miles from Rome . SCIPIO I tell you , Hannibal is at the gates ! META ( Crosses up C. to foot of ladder ) Do you hear that , Varius ? Hannibal is at the gates ! ( FABIUS sits down helplessly . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Almost sobbing ) Hannibal  --  at the gates of Rome . What happened ? ( SCIPIO sits bench . ) SCIPIO The Roman army has been wiped out . Our strength and our prestige are gone . Hannibal rules the world . FABIUS MAXIMUS What shall we do ? What shall we do ? SCIPIO ( Rising ) You are the Dictator , Fabius . It is for you to decide . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Dully ) Yes , I am the Dictator . It is for me to decide . ( He stands up , making a tremendous effort to pull himself together . Laughs sarcastically . Crosses up C. ) Go , Cato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you can find them . p. 40 CATO Yes , sir ! FABIUS MAXIMUS Tell them to come here at once . CATO Yes , sir ! ( He runs out U.R . FABIA appears , down L. , greatly annoyed at this unusual disturbance . ) FABIA What is all this racket ? ( Up L.C. by rail ) Varius , what are you doing up on the roof ? VARIUS I 'm looking at Hannibal . FABIA Is Hannibal up there , on the roof ? ( SCIPIO crosses to R. of table , stands . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS Hannibal is at the gates of Rome . ( AMYTIS comes in hurriedly , from D.L. ) AMYTIS ( Crosses up to FABIUS ) What 's all this about Hannibal ? FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Desperately ) Do I have to say it again ? SCIPIO Our army has been defeated . Hannibal has marched to Rome . He will occupy the city at any moment . AMYTIS ( Apparently delighted  --  crosses down to SCIPIO ) You do n't mean it ! p. 41 VARIUS It 's true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his campfires . ( Comes down ladder . ) AMYTIS ( On downstage edge of table ) So Hannibal got here , after all . FABIUS MAXIMUS Yes  --  and it means death to us all  --  the end of everything for Rome . AMYTIS ( Laughs ) Think of it Hannibal ! FABIUS MAXIMUS Rome has been betrayed by the gods . AMYTIS Why do n't you sit down , Scipio ? You must be fearfully tired . SCIPIO ( Ungraciously ) I 'm perfectly able to stand , thank you . ( It is obvious that he bears no love for AMYTIS , an attitude that is not uncommon among the friends of FABIUS . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Crosses down below bench ) Is there any remnant of the army left , Scipio ? SCIPIO None , Fabius . We were annihilated at Can nae . A few of us cut our way back to Rome , but even then we travelled no faster than Hannibal with his entire army . He is a superman  --  a god  --  against whom mortal strength is of no avail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't understand it , Scipio . Superman or no superman  --  we outnumbered his army two to one . I thought we had him caught in a trap . SCIPIO Hannibal let us think so . He forced us to attack the center of his line , where his weakest troops were massed . He allowed us to drive through  --  and then surrounded us , with his infantry and Numidian cavalry . FABIUS MAXIMUS More of his damnable deception . AMYTIS We would never have resorted to such foul tactics  --  would we , Fabius ? FABIUS MAXIMUS Never ! AMYTIS ( Sits chair L. of table ) No  --  we would n't have thought of them . ( FABIUS paces up and down in a turmoil of baffled rage , nervous apprehension and utter bewilderment . FABIA goes up L. by entrance . ) SCIPIO I saw Hasdrubal , the Numidian cavalry leader , cut down dozens of our men with his own sword . He fought like a fiend sent down by the gods to punish us . AMYTIS And did you see Hannibal ? SCIPIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was he doing ? SCIPIO He was standing on a little hill FABIUS MAXIMUS Laughing , I suppose ? SCIPIO No  --  he was not laughing . He was watching the battle as though it were a play that he had written , being performed by actors in a theatre . AMYTIS Is Hannibal good-looking ? SCIPIO Hannibal 's personal appearance did not interest me at the moment . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( In front of bench ) Amytis , this is a serious matter . I must ask you not to bother us with irrelevant questions now . AMYTIS But this is n't irrelevant . It is very important for Hannibal to be handsome . ( Up ) Think of the statues . ( Crosses down and sits edge of table again . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS What else happened , Scipio ? SCIPIO They closed in on us and butchered us and all through the battle their terrible African war drums kept on beating  --  louder  --  louder AMYTIS It must have been thrilling ! SCIPIO Our army was a confused mass of struggling , writhing men  --  battling against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unspeakably awful When it was over , at last , seventy thousand Romans lay dead on the field of Cannae. p. 44 AMYTIS ( Slowly ) Seventy thousand ! Why did they die ? SCIPIO ( Bitterly ) Ask Hannibal why they died . FABIUS MAXIMUS Seventy thousand ! What horror ! What is this terrible thing the gods have done to us , Scipio  --  to us who have made our sacrifices regularly in the temple and have spared no effort to show our gratitude for past favors ? I ca n't understand it . ( Sits bench . FABIA crosses down behind and puts hands on his shoulders . ) AMYTIS Perhaps Hannibal was nice to the gods , too . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Vchemently ) Hannibal 's gods are false gods ! AMYTIS Oh  --  I see . ( Sits R. of table . ) SCIPIO You must take immediate action , Fabius . Hannibal may advance on the city at any moment . AMYTIS Ca n't you possibly keep him out ? FABIUS MAXIMUS No . I 'm afraid not . We have no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are five thousand men against Hannibal ? SCIPIO Every Roman is prepared to fight to the last . p. 45 FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Crosses up C. ) But our women  --  what of them ? Can we see them ? You must escape , both of you , while there is still time . My wife and my mother must be spared . AMYTIS ( Still sitting R. of table ) Spared from what ? FABIUS MAXIMUS From the bestiality of Hannibal 's men . AMYTIS And are all the Carthaginians so  --  so extremely warm-blooded ? FABIUS MAXIMUS They 're all utterly ruthless . When they enter the city , not one of our women will escape . AMYTIS ( Laughs ) It ought to be quite an experience for the women of Rome . FABIUS MAXIMUS You must leave the city at once , Amytis . AMYTIS And how about you , Fabius ? FABIUS MAXIMUS I am prepared to die  --  but I am a man . FABIA And I , too , am prepared to die . I am a Roman ! Here I was born , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall die . AMYTIS ( Rises ) Well , I am not prepared to die ! I am not a Roman . I was not born here  --  and I have certainly borne no children here or anywhere else . I shall go to Ostia and join my mother . p. 46 SCIPIO ( Scornfully ) Spoken like a true Greek . AMYTIS Oh , I know it , Scipio  --  I 'm a contemptible coward , but I ca n't help it . I love life , even monotonous life , and I ca n't bear to part with it . ( Puts arms up to him ) Do you feel bitterness against me , Fabius , because I am not as brave as your mother ? FABIUS MAXIMUS No , Amytis  --  but it would be beautiful if we were to die together . AMYTIS ( Crosses down R. below table  --  laughs heartily ) I 'm sorry , Fabius , but that 's not my idea of beauty . ( Sits edge of table ) I must confess that I shudder at the thought . FABIA ( Coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse to tell you what I think of you . I 've tried to see the best in you , because you were my son 's wife . But there is no best in you . You , who were honored with the love of a good man , have thrown it aside , flippantly . You have put on the airs of a goddess , and displayed the morals FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Forces her gently downstage below bench ) Mother ! FABIA I hate you  --  I hate you  --  and I 'm glad that the clean streets of Rome are not to be soiled with your vile blood . p. 47 FABIUS MAXIMUS Mother ! You must n't say such things to Amytis . She 's sensitive . AMYTIS No , Fabius , I 'm not sensitive . I do n't mind . ( Crosses up C. ) In fact , I 'm glad that your mother has finally had the chance to deliver herself on this subject . It 's been worrying her for a long time . I 've noticed that . FABIA Oh , you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've fooled him , all right , with your artificial beauty and your false Athenian superiority . Now , thank the gods , he sees you as you are  --  a heartless , soulless traitor ! ( FABIUS forces her into a chair at the left downstage . ) AMYTIS ( C. ) I may be a traitor to Rome , but I am not a traitor to my own convictions . I did n't start this war . I 've never given it my support or encouragement . I have no axe to grind with Hannibal . Why should I sacrifice my life merely because the Roman army has failed to subdue a weaker enemy ? FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Wearily , sits bench . FABIA rises and crosses up L. ) If you feel that way about it , you 'd better go . AMYTIS ( Crosses to FABIUS ) I 'm afraid I must , Fabius . You would n't want me to stay and be  --  whatever you call it , would you ? p. 48 FABIUS MAXIMUS Do n't speak of it , Amytis . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line somewhere Varius , go bring out the horses  --  the fastest horses in the stable . VARIUS Yes , my lady . ( He dashes out up L. ) AMYTIS Meta , come and help me make ready for the journey . We must n't waste a moment . ( META to below door down L. ) FABIA Luckily , Rome does not have to suffer because of your cowardice . AMYTIS Yes , mother  --  and Rome would gain nothing by my bravery if I were to stay and offer up my beautiful white body Come on , Meta . ( She and META go out D.L. ) FABIUS MAXIMUS Go see if you can help her , mother . FABIA I 'll do nothing of the kind . I shall go to the kitchen , and with my own hands I shall prepare some broth for you , my son  --  my true , Roman son . ( She embraces him and goes out D.R. ) FABIUS MAXIMUS ( In desperation ) I ca n't face this calamity , Scipio . Somehow , it does n't seem right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . p. 49 SCIPIO Hannibal is greater than the gods . We may despise him as an enemy  --  we may do all in our power to  --  ( Loud and continued knocking at door up R. )  --  discredit him  --  but no Roman sword will ever cut the laurel wreath of genius from his brow . FABIUS MAXIMUS I could well afford to see Hannibal , laurel wreath and all , at the bottom of the Tiber . ( Rises . Enter up R. SERTORIUS , an elderly senator , and DRUSUS , an equally elderly general . They greet FABIUS formally . ) Have you heard the terrible news from Can nae ? DRUSUS All Rome has heard it by now . Every house in the city is draped with mourning for the dead , and great crowds are gathered in the marketplace , weeping hysterically and sending up cries for mercy to the gods . FABIUS MAXIMUS It will do them no good . The gods are in Hannibal 's  --  ( Again short knock up R. Enter TIBULLUS , followed by CATO )  --  camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people may commit in their madness . What are we to do ? FABIUS MAXIMUS What is there to do ? Hannibal holds us in the hollow of his hand . p. 50 TIBULLUS ( Crosses down C.  --  CATO remains upstage behind grill ) You must take decisive action , Fabius . You must do something ! FABIUS MAXIMUS ( To down L. ) If we could only delay for a few days , we might recall our army from the siege of Capua . TIBULLUS Delay is out of the question . Hannibal will attack before morning ! DRUSUS We could n't possibly get our army back from Capua in less than two weeks . SERTORIUS By that time , Rome will be a mass of smoking ruins . FABIUS MAXIMUS I suppose it 's hopeless . ( AMYTIS enters D.L. , followed by META , who carries large bundle . ) AMYTIS ( Crosses to up L.C. , above bench ) Good evening , gentlemen . I hope that you are all enjoying this fine day . SERTORIUS Unfortunately , the smoke of Hannibal 's camp-fire interferes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the seacoast , to spend a quiet holiday with my mother . I hope to find you all here when I get back . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( L.C. below bench ) Amytis ! How can you be so callous ? p. 51 AMYTIS ( Coming down C. ) Can you blame me for being cheerful in the face of danger ? You might try it yourself . If Hannibal should march into Rome , and find you all laughing , he might forget what he came for and join in the merriment . SCIPIO Hannibal does not laugh . ( VARIUS enters from the left upstage . Stands in entrance . ) VARIUS The horses are ready , my lady . AMYTIS Then we must start . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Tremulously ) Good-bye , Amytis . I 'm afraid I shall never see you again . AMYTIS ( Cross down to him ) Do n't say that , Fabius . Hannibal has n't conquered Rome yet . There is still hope . FABIUS MAXIMUS Hope is a poor defense against the Numidian cavalry . AMYTIS It 's the only defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose so . We 're doomed . AMYTIS ( Back up C. ) Had you ever thought of treating with Hannibal ? DRUSUS What do you mean ? AMYTIS I mean  --  why do n't you go out , under a flag of truce , meet Hannibal and talk the thing over in a civilized manner . He sounds to me like the type of man who might listen to reason . p. 52 FABIUS MAXIMUS I wonder if he would ? SCIPIO ( Indignantly ) Nonsense ! Hannibal talks only on the field of battle , with words of steel . The Roman does not live who can argue with him successfully there . DRUSUS Scipio is right . We 'll have to fight it out . SERTORIUS We can at least show him that Romans know how to die . ( From a distance the faint sound of many drums is heard , beating rhythmically , ominously . FABIA enters down R. and stands in doorway . ) FABIA ( Starting ) What 's that ? SCIPIO It 's the drums  --  the African war drums . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Hysterically ) O , gods of Rome  --  save us ! Save us ! FABIUS MAXIMUS The gods ca n't hear you , Tibullus . AMYTIS In that case , I had better hurry . I do n't even know how to die gracefully . ( Crosses to FABIUS ) Good-bye , my husband . ( Crosses to FABIA , who is C. ) Good-bye , mother . ( Crosses up C. ) Good-bye , gentlemen . ( Salutes them . ) Oh , Fabius , please do n't eat too much starchy food while I 'm away . ( As she exists ) It is extremely bad for you . ( Exit upstage left with META and VARIUS . ) ( CATO exits U.R . FABIA crosses up L. as if to look after AMYTIS. ) p. 53 FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Crosses to table ) Now let 's get down to business . ( Surrounded by the others ) We must concentrate our infantry outside the city walls , prepared to withstand the first shock of assault . FABIA Fabius FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Paying no attention ) Our cavalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , prepared to make a sortie through the east gate when the situation becomes desperate FABIA Fabius FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Still not listening ) You , Drusus , will take command of the infantry on the left . FABIA ( Louder  --  crosses to him ) Fabius ! FABIUS MAXIMUS And you , Scipio ( FABIA pulls his arm . FABIUS turns to her ) What is it , mother ? FABIA Did you notice anything about Amytis when she left ? FABIUS MAXIMUS She seemed to be in a hurry . FABIA Did you notice anything strange in her appearance ? FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Impatiently ) No , I did not . p. 54 FABIA She was wearing that new green silk dress ! FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Not interested ) She was , was she ? ( Turns to group at table ) Now , if Hannibal attacks us on the right , you , Scipio , will move forward to meet him in pitched battle . If he concentrates on the left ( Turns to FABIA ) The  --  the green dress , eh !

The scene is Hannibal 's headquarters in a temple , about a mile east of Rome . The temple , normally open , has been converted into a sort of tent by means of rich , crimson draperies , which form the background of the scene . These draperies have been parted so as to form a wide entrance , upstage and slightly to the right , through which the Italian landscape is dimly visible . Characters coming through this entrance walk up two steps to reach the stage . There is another entrance at the extreme right , downstage . At the left , downstage , a corner of the inner temple juts out . This is used as Hannibal 's sleeping quarters , and is entered through a door . There is a fourth entrance , upstage left , between the corner of the inner temple and the draperies at the back . To the left , and slightly upstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns , of equal size , at either side of the main entrance , although these are largely masked by the draperies . At the right are a triangular table and two chairs , painted in weird colors and designs . By the column , at the L. , are a chair R. and a massive chest and stool L. There is another chest at the back , to the L. of the main entrance . It is night  --  an hour later than the conclusion of Act I  --  and two braziers are burning dimly , one at the L. and another at the R. Although the scene is a Roman temple , and although it is probable that Hannibal did not carry many household effects with him on his long march , strict realism and logic may be sacrificed for purposes of dramatic effectiveness in this scene .

The SERGEANT is a rough , husky , brutal veteran , whose counterpart is to be found on every drill ground from Quantico to Aldershot . The GUARDSMEN are fine , upstanding soldiers  --  young , vigorous , confident , and cheerful . By their immediate appearance , they must suggest an emphatic contrast to the hopeless depression of Fabius and the other men in Rome . There is an eloquently triumphant air about them . In their speech they are tough and hard-boiled , exactly in the manner of the corporals in " What Price Glory , " it being not unreasonable to assume that professional soldiers twenty-one hundred years ago did not differ materially from the professional soldiers of to-day . Their uniforms are neat , but they show signs of long and arduous wear . The SERGEANT passes down the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending with the FIRST GUARDSMAN on the right . He inspects the swords and equipment of the men . One helmet on NO . ONE is on crooked ; the SERGEANT unceremoniously straightens it ; he kicks NO . THREE in foot to straighten him up . At the table sits THOTHMES , the Egyptian clerk , a wizened little old man who laboriously inscribes characters with a brush on sheets of papyrus , paying no attention to the others . SERGEANT ( To the FIRST GUARDSMAN ) Look at the rust on that sword . Ai n't you been in the army long enough to know how to keep your arms clean ? p. 56 FIRST GUARDSMAN ( Very weakly ) Yes , Sergeant . I cleaned it thoroughly this morning . It got rusty during dinner . SERGEANT During dinner ! Were you eating with it ? FIRST GUARDSMAN No , Sergeant . I was cutting oranges . You ca n't imagine how those oranges stain the steel . SERGEANT Never mind about the oranges . See that it 's clean before the Chief gets here . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a turn with the elephants . FIRST GUARDSMAN Yes , Sergeant . ( The SERGEANT crosses down C. , then notices something about the SECOND GUARDSMAN 'S face . He steps up to him for closer scrutiny . ) SERGEANT Did you wash your face ? SECOND GUARDSMAN Yes , Sergeant . SERGEANT When ? While we was crossing the Alps , I suppose . It 's about time you went over it again . SECOND GUARDSMAN Yes , Sergeant . SERGEANT ( Crosses down C. ) Now listen to this , you men . The Commander-in-Chief is inspecting the army , and he 'll be through any minute now . There 's going to be a meeting here of the General Staff , Hannibal , Hasdrubal , and all the rest . You 've got to be on the job . Do you get that ? You 'll act as runners when you 're needed . You 'll be in charge , Corporal , ' till I get back . p. 57 CORPORAL Yes , Sergeant . SERGEANT Keep two of the men on post outside headquarters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NO . ONE . He addresses the FIRST GUARDSMAN ) And you  --  do n't you litter up this place with no orange peels , neither . FIRST GUARDSMAN No , Sergeant . ( The SERGEANT stalks out , up R. ) THIRD GUARDSMAN ( Sweetly ) Good-bye , Sergeant . Come back soon . ( The CORPORAL steps out of line and faces the squad . ) CORPORAL ( To FOURTH and FIFTH GUARDSMEN ) You men follow me . The rest of you , fall out . Hup  --  hup  --   --  ( He goes out up R. with the two guardsmen . The other three break ranks and sit down . NO . THREE takes stool L. of column . NO . ONE sits on floor , back against column , between NO . TWO and NO . THREE . NO . TWO pulls chair R. of column so it faces downstage , sits . ) FIRST GUARDSMAN ( Drawing his sword and exhibiting it ) Look ! He calls that rusty . p. 58 THIRD GUARDSMAN Well , I would n't exactly call it spotlessly clean myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a fine army , all right . They expect you to mop up the whole of Italy and keep clean at the same time . THIRD GUARDSMAN That 's all right . You heard what the Sergeant said about the Chief . If he catches you with a rusty sword , you 'll be doing a turn with the elephants . FIRST GUARDSMAN I do n't do no turn with no elephants , see ? Not while old Hannibal is running this army . I 'm Hannibal 's little favorite , I am . He 's very , very fond of me . Hannibal wants me right here on headquarters staff where I can look out for him . SECOND GUARDSMAN I 'm certainly glad to hear that . I always wondered who was really the brains of this army . THIRD GUARDSMAN Just the same , I 'd arrange to keep that knife clean , if I was you . Them elephants need a lot of attention  --  ( NO . TWO and NO . THREE laugh )  --  and Hannibal do n't like to have ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He put his own brother in command of the elephant brigade , did n't he ? His own brother . p. 59 FIRST GUARDSMAN Oh , I know why Mago got that assignment . Hannibal did n't want anyone to think he 's playing favorites . He gives his own brother the rottenest job in the army just to show how impartial he is . THIRD GUARDSMAN I 've felt sorry for the poor kid . He 's been wet-nursing those damned elephants now for two years . FIRST GUARDSMAN ( Laughs ) At first , he seemed to be fond of ' em . SECOND GUARDSMAN Yeh  --  I was with the elephant brigade when we was quartered on the Rhone . Well , it seems that there was some sort of funny business among the elephants , and one of the females got  --  you  --  know  --  in a family way THIRD GUARDSMAN Go ' way ! SECOND GUARDSMAN Well , we got orders to move across the river , and young Mago comes up to the chief and says , " Hannibal , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my elephants is about to become a mother . " And Hannibal say , " That 's interesting , but what are we going to do about it ? Do you think we ought to hold up the army ' till the child is born ? " And young Mago says , " Yes , brother , I think we should , because that elephant ought not to be moved , not in her condition . " Well , sir , Hannibal tried not to laugh , and he finally told the kid , " Mago , " he says , " we 've got a very important war on our hands , and however much we may sympathize with this poor , wayward elephant , I 'm afraid we ca n't afford to wait for her . " You know how long it takes an elephant to come across , do n't you ? p. 60 FIRST GUARDSMAN No . SECOND GUARDSMAN Seven years ! ( They all laugh uproariously . ) THIRD GUARDSMAN We 'd have been there yet . I guess young Mago has felt sorry sometimes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye on him too much . Mago would like to have some fun with the women , like the rest of us , but Hannibal wo n't let him . FIRST GUARDSMAN Hannibal thinks his own brother ought to be above such things . THIRD GUARDSMAN Ah  --  the Chief do n't know what it is to have a good time . FIRST GUARDSMAN Well , it 's all right with me , as long as us privates can have it  --  when we can get it . SECOND GUARDSMAN If you ask me , Mago and the rest of the officers ai n't been missing much . The women around here in Italy are terrible . They ai n't got no originality at all ! THIRD GUARDSMAN Just wait ' till I get back to Carthage ! FIRST GUARDSMAN Yes  --  just wait . We 've been on the road for four years now , and it do n't look as if this war would ever be over . THIRD GUARDSMAN ( Sauntering over to the right ) Do n't you worry about that . ( Up across C. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He points out at the right ) Do you see what 's over there on them hills ? Do you know what that is ? That 's Rome ! That 's the place we 've come all this way to get  --  and we 're going to get it ! When we 've cleaned up that job , we 're all going home . p. 61 SECOND GUARDSMAN ( NO . ONE takes place vacated by NO . THREE on stool L. of column ) Do n't talk to me about Rome . It 's the biggest disappointment of my life . Why , I expected to see a real city , with big palaces , all made out of marble and gold and jewelry . I thought I 'd take home enough souvenirs to keep me and the missus in luxury for the rest of our lives and just look at the little dump ! We 'll be lucky to pick up a square meal in the whole town . FIRST GUARDSMAN It 's your own fault , soldier . You would see the world . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where THOTHMES is writing . ) THIRD GUARDSMAN What are you writing at now , Gyppy ? THOTHMES ( In a very deliberate , precise manner ) I am compiling the official record of the battle of Can nae . SECOND GUARDSMAN You 've got a fine job , Gyppy . We fight the battles , and you write ' em . THOTHMES Somebody has to do this work in the army . FIRST GUARDSMAN Yes  --  and they always manage to find some damned Egyptian to do it . THIRD GUARDSMAN And somebody else has to do the dirty work  --  and would n't you know they 'd pick on me for a job like that ! p. 62 THOTHMES You young men should realize that these records of mine have intense historical value . ( NO . THREE crosses L. by door . ) I have here the entire story of Hannibal 's march . SECOND GUARDSMAN Do n't talk to me about history . I 'm getting pretty damned sick of parading around the world making history for somebody else to read . THIRD GUARDSMAN ( Looking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , anyway ? FIRST GUARDSMAN It 's a temple , ai n't it , Gyppy ? THOTHMES It 's the temple of the Vestal Virgins . Each year the Roman High Priests select six maidens to guard the sacred flame  --   --  THIRD GUARDSMAN Vestal Virgins , eh ! ( He starts toward the door L. ) Well  --  let 's have a look around . ( He opens the door L. and peers in . ) SECOND GUARDSMAN He 's lookin ' for virgins . There 's an optimist ! You 'd better keep out of there , soldier . That 's Hannibal 's sleeping quarters . ( The THIRD GUARDSMAN closes the door hurriedly . ) ( Enter the CORPORAL up R. ) p. 63 CORPORAL Watch yourselves , boys . Hasdrubal is coming up the hill . There 's going to be one of them conferences here . ' Tshun ! ( They line up . NO . TWO replaces chair . He salutes as HASDRUBAL strides in . HASDRUBAL is the second in command of the Carthaginian army  --  a dark , ominous , explosive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that indicates intense nervous energy . He glares at the three guardsmen . He has a rolled map in his hand . ) HASDRUBAL Is Hannibal here yet ? CORPORAL No , sir . He has n't come yet . He 's down HASDRUBAL ( Barking out his words ) What are you men doing here ? Why are n't you out making yourselves useful ? CORPORAL We were posted here by the Sergeant , sir . HASDRUBAL ( With withering sarcasm ) Oh  --  I see . This army is being commanded by sergeants , eh ? CORPORAL That seems to be the general impression , sir  --  among the sergeants . HASDRUBAL You can convey my humble apologies to the Sergeant . Tell him I thought you might be more useful digging latrines , or any other damned thing you can think of . But do n't stand around ! Do you grasp that ? p. 64 CORPORAL Yes , sir . HASDRUBAL Very well , then . Get out ! CORPORAL Yes , sir . Hup ! Hup ! ( The CORPORAL and the THREE GUARDSMEN march out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing laboriously . ) HASDRUBAL You , too . You 'll have to find some other place to do your home work . THOTHMES But I was told HASDRUBAL Never mind what you were told . I 'm telling you something else . Get out ! THOTHMES Very well , sir . ( THOTHMES gathers up his sheets of papyrus and his writing utensils . HASDRUBAL stands L. of the table and spreads out a map , which he proceeds to study . ) ( CARTHALO and MAHARBAL enter up R. CARTHALO is a rough , bluff old warrior . MAHARBAL is a gaunt , hard , cynical strategist . ) ( THOTHMES goes out up L. with an apprehensive glance toward HASDRUBAL . ) CARTHALO Hello , Hasdrubal . Is the Chief here yet ? HASDRUBAL Hello . No , there was no one here but some damned guardsmen . They told me they could n't leave because they 'd been posted by a sergeant . Oh , how I hate staff sergeants ! ( Sits L. of table  --  reads map. ) p. 65 MAHARBAL We 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many inconveniences of war . ( Crosses above table . ) CARTHALO The Chief has been down inspecting my divisions . He certainly does look tired . ( C. ) MAHARBAL He 's been through the whole army since we pulled in this afternoon , examining the equipment and the food and talking to the men . HASDRUBAL I wish I had his patience . It seems to be a physical impossibility for me to talk to a private without losing my temper . ( Enter MAGO wearily up R. He is Hannibal 's younger brother  --  a personable youth , well set up and handsome . At the start of the campaign , he had been terribly enthusiastic and overwhelmed by the craving for adventure , but most of the thrill has worn off by now . Nevertheless , he is still fresh and jaunty , with an irrepressible self-assurance . ) CARTHALO AND MAHARBAL Hello , Mago MAGO Hello , Hasdrubal  --  hello ( He sinks down wearily on chair R. of column . ) CARTHALO Well , Mago  --  how are the elephants ? MAGO Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em bathed , and fed , and their tusks polished . I 've put ' em to bed , and sung ' em lullabies and I 'm tired out . p. 66 HASDRUBAL Did you see Hannibal ? MAGO Oh , yes . He 's just been down inspecting us . He wants to make sure that the dear elephants are entirely comfortable . CARTHALO Never mind , Mago . You 'll have your reward to-morrow . You and your elephants will be able to march into Rome . MAGO Do we go in to-morrow ? Are we that near ? HASDRUBAL ( Without looking up from map , gestures out up R. ) Of course we are . There 's Rome right over there . MAGO ( Jumping up and going to look out up R. ) So that 's Rome , is it ? It is n't so much , after all . MAHARBAL ( Crosses C. ) I would n't be too sure that we 're going into Rome to-morrow . HASDRUBAL ( Looks up ) Why not ? Why should we delay ? MAHARBAL Hannibal may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a message from Capua to-day , asking for help . There 's a Roman army there besieging our allies . HASDRUBAL ( Enraged  --  up , crosses , stands R. of column ) Well , who gives a good goddamn for our allies ? We 've come all this way to destroy Rome , have n't we ? And now 's our chance , is n't it ? p. 67 MAHARBAL You know Hannibal . He makes his own decisions for himself . He does n't ask our advice . CARTHALO He does n't need it . HASDRUBAL Hannibal is insane if he turns away from Rome now . The city is ours . They have only two legions to defend it . We could walk in this minute and if we fail to destroy Rome now , you know what 'll happen in Carthage , do n't you ? They 'll turn against Hannibal . He 'll be discredited  --  stripped of his power . Oh , he ca n't make a mistake like this . ( The SERGEANT is heard , offstage , to shout " Tshun ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as HANNIBAL enters up R. , followed by BALA . ) ( HANNIBAL is tall , thin , dark , quiet and surprisingly unemphatic in his speech  --  rather diffident in his manner . He is obviously terribly tired , but he has trained himself to such a point that he can readily ignore fatigue . He is the sort of man who is apparently none too powerful physically , but manages to exist on an inexhaustible supply of reserve strength . He provides not only the brains which direct his army , but the vitality which animates it . He is regarded with absolutely unqualified respect by his officers and men alike ; his mildest whisper is instantly obeyed . HANNIBAL returns the salute " at ease , gentlemen , " and then removes his helmet and sword , which he hands to BALA , a gigantic Nubian slave , who follows him . BALA goes out at D.L. HANNIBAL walks to the table and sits down L. of table , relaxing easily in the chair. ) p. 68 HANNIBAL Have you been looking at Rome ? MAGO Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have a closer view to-morrow . HASDRUBAL ( Excitedly ) Are we going in ? HANNIBAL We attack the city on the morning . HASDRUBAL Thank the gods ! We 're going in at last ! ( The four officers are obviously delighted at the prospect . MAGO sits R. of table . ) MAHARBAL I was afraid you might decide to turn off and raise the siege of Capua . HANNIBAL Capua can wait . The men need time for rest and recreation after all they 've been through . The destruction of Rome will be in the nature of harmless diversion . CARTHALO Are we going to burn Rome to the ground ? HANNIBAL I suppose so . That 's what we came for , is n't it ? HASDRUBAL Of course it is ! We 'll show those damned Roman upstarts that they ca n't dispute the supremacy of Carthage . When we get through with Rome , there 'll be nothing left of it but a memory . HANNIBAL ( Thinking of something else ) Nothing left but a memory . p. 69 MAGO I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fun . HANNIBAL On the contrary , Mago , the elephants will lead the procession into the city . I want you to put on your finest uniform , comb your hair , and shave carefully , because we expect you to look your best . We must convince these Roman upstarts , as Hasdrubal calls them , of our importance . MAGO I 'll have those elephants painted every color in the rainbow . HANNIBAL I would n't exactly overdo it . We want the Roman citizens to think that we 're an army . We must n't look too much like a circus parade . HASDRUBAL They know we 're an army , all right . They found that out at Lake Trasimenus and Can nae . HANNIBAL Do n't boast about your victories , Hasdrubal . You can save them for your wife when you get home . HASDRUBAL ( Crosses to HANNIBAL ) Damn it all , sir , you do n't seem to get any satisfaction out of anything . You ought to feel proud that our army has beaten the Romans whenever we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us and celebrate a victory , now and then . Sometimes , by the gods , I actually think you do n't care whether we win or lose . ( HANNIBAL stands up , and walks slowly across the stage during the following speech. ) p. 70 HANNIBAL It 's not quite as bad as all that , Hasdrubal . ( In front of stool , L. of column ) I do care whether we win or lose . I suppose it 's the only thing I have to care about in the whole world . But  --  if we win a victory , that 's that . We have to go on to the next battle , then the next , and the next , until we 've finished this war . Then we go home to Carthage and start looking for another . MAHARBAL You ought to take a rest , sir . HANNIBAL That 's just the trouble with victory , Maharbal . You ca n't rest . You 're only allowed to quit when you 're losing . Look at those seventy thousand Roman soldiers butchered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome is destroyed or not . Their work is done . They 're at liberty to take a rest  --  a long rest . HASDRUBAL They can have their rest . I 'd rather go on fighting . HANNIBAL Of course , Hasdrubal . ( Crosses to him C. ) You 're a soldier , and a damned good one . ( Sits chair R. of column ) You live on cavalry charges , flank movements and counter-attacks ; it 's your whole existence . HASDRUBAL How about yourself , sir ? I have n't noticed you signing any peace treaties . p. 71 HANNIBAL I know it . But then , I have my oath to think of  --  undying hatred of Rome . I have had that with me ever since I was nine years old , and I ca n't very well get rid of it until there 's no more Rome left for me to hate . CARTHALO That 's the proper spirit , sir . It 's much easier to kill a man if you hate him . HANNIBAL Very true , Carthalo , very true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( All laugh . ) MAHARBAL Have you any orders for to-morrow , sir ? HANNIBAL Never mind them now , Maharbal . They 're very simple , and we can talk them over in the morning . We all need some rest to-night . MAHARBAL ( A step C. ) You need it most of all , sir . How long is it since you 've had any sleep ? HANNIBAL Oh , I do n't remember . What difference does it make ? MAHARBAL It would make a great deal of difference to this army if you wrecked your health . CARTHALO We could n't go on , sir . HASDRUBAL Do n't be a damned fool , sir . For the love of Ba-al , take care of yourself . HANNIBAL I thank you , gentlemen , for the vote of confidence , but I can assure you that there 's no cause for alarm . I fully expect to survive the destruction of Rome . p. 72 MAGO After that 's over , we can all go home , ca n't we ? HANNIBAL I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will feel like to be back in civilian clothes . HANNIBAL ( Rises ) Well  --  you gentlemen can get back to your units , now . See that the men do n't sit up all night drinking . They must get some sleep . HASDRUBAL , MAHARBAL , CARTHALO Yes , sir . ( They salute and go out up R. MAGO stays behind . ) MAGO ( Rises from seat ) Can I stay for a while , Hannibal ? I get so damned lonely down there with nobody to talk to except the elephants . HANNIBAL Yes , Mago , I want you to stay . MAGO ( Sits R. edge of table ) Have you heard anything from home , lately ? HANNIBAL Yes  --  I got a letter from mother today . It was sent through Capua and forwarded on here . MAGO What does she say ? HANNIBAL ( Standing L. of table ) Oh , not much . Everything 's just about the same in Carthage . They 're all delighted at our victories . ( Picks up mallet for gong. ) p. 73 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they wo n't do anything to help us . They expect us to get along without reinforcements or supplies or money . I wish some of those damned politicians could see what it 's like over here . It might change their attitude about war a little . HANNIBAL I think we can manage without their assistance . ( He rings the gong . ) MAGO What else does mother have to say ? ( BALA enters D.L. HANNIBAL hands MAGO letter . ) HANNIBAL ( Crosses below column ) She says that Uncle Hamilcar fell down and broke his hip again . MAGO Thanks . HANNIBAL ( To BALA ) We 'll have supper here whenever it 's ready . ( BALA bows and goes out up L. ) HANNIBAL ( To MAGO ) I 'm going to try to get clean . ( HANNIBAL goes out at D.L. ) ( MAGO crosses C. below column , stands , reading the letter . The SERGEANT , up R. , enters briskly and salutes . ) MAGO What is it , Sergeant ? p. 74 SERGEANT We 've caught a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart out . SERGEANT It is n't a he , sir . It 's a woman . MAGO What sort of a woman ? SERGEANT A young woman , sir . She says she 's a Roman lady . Not bad-looking , either . ( BALA quietly enters up L. , places large tray on which are two cups and two wine jugs on stands upstage behind column  --  exits up L. ) MAGO Bring her in . ( The SERGEANT goes to U.R . and calls , " Bring ' em in , Corporal . " The CORPORAL enters with AMYTIS , VARIUS and META , accompanied by the FIRST and SECOND GUARDSMEN , who have their swords drawn . MAGO continues to read the letter , paying little attention to the prisoners . ) MAGO ( To AMYTIS ) They tell me you 're a spy . AMYTIS Why , no , sir , I 'm not exactly a spy . I MAGO Who are those others ? AMYTIS They 're only my slaves  --  a delightful young couple from Sicily . p. 75 MAGO Where did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em up , sir . They was prowling around outside the camp  --  said they was refugees from Rome and got lost . AMYTIS We were trying to escape from the city , and took the wrong road . MAGO That sounds highly improbable . Have you anything more to say for yourself ? AMYTIS I beg your pardon . Are you Hannibal ? MAGO I am not . AMYTIS I did n't really think you were . MAGO I happen to be Hannibal 's brother , in case you 're interested . AMYTIS Where is Hannibal ? I should love to meet him . MAGO I 'm afraid that I must deny my brother that pleasure . Sergeant , take these damned Romans out and put ' em to death . ( The SERGEANT steps forward to seize AMYTIS , but hesitates when she speaks . ) AMYTIS To death ! But you ca n't do that  --  it  --  it is n't fair . ( SERGEANT retreats to original position . ) VARIUS ( Starting forward ) You have no right to kill her . She 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . He retreats. ) p. 76 AMYTIS Hush , Varius . ( To MAGO ) I should like to know who gave you authority to sentence me to death , without a hearing , with no attempt at justice ? MAGO You know the penalty . You took your chances when you came to spy on us . AMYTIS But I did n't . MAGO You 're a Roman , are n't you ? AMYTIS Of course , I MAGO That 's all I need to know . You 're a Roman , an enemy of Carthage . You were caught snooping around within our lines . You 'll have to die . AMYTIS Ca n't I even say a word in my own defense ? MAGO You 've said too much already . AMYTIS And I ca n't see Hannibal ? MAGO ( Vehemently ) No ! You ca n't see Hannibal . He has enough to worry about without having to listen to you . AMYTIS I suppose I shall have to take your word for it . ( She turns to VARIUS and META ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VARIUS ' hand ) We 're not afraid . p. 77 AMYTIS Of course you 're not , you poor things . Roman slaves have n't much to live for . VARIUS But you  --  my lady  --  you 're not ready to die . AMYTIS I 'm always ready , Varius But it is a nuisance . If I 'd only stayed in Rome , I should have been acclaimed a heroine by my husband and Scipio and all those stuffy old Senators . Now , I must sacrifice my life and get no credit for it . MAGO We do n't ordinarily bury spies with military honors , but we might make an exception in your case . AMYTIS I 'm sure you 'll do the right thing . MAGO All right , Sergeant . SERGEANT Hup ! ( The SERGEANT , CORPORAL and GUARDSMEN start to lead AMYTIS , VARIUS and META out . ) MAGO Oh  --  just a minute ! ( All turn back to original position , facing downstage . ) Have you searched these people , Sergeant ? SERGEANT ( Turning to CORPORAL ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turning to GUARDSMAN NO . ONE ) Have you searched these people ? p. 78 FIRST GUARDSMAN Have you searched these people ? ( The SECOND GUARDSMAN turns his head slightly to see whether there is anyone to whom he can pass the buck . ) SECOND GUARDSMAN No , sir ! FIRST GUARDSMAN No , sir ! CORPORAL No , sir ! SERGEANT No , sir ! MAGO Then search ' em quickly . They may have despatches concealed . ( The CORPORAL and the GUARDSMEN start to search VARIUS and META . The SERGEANT starts to search AMYTIS . ) AMYTIS Do I have to be pawed by this man ? MAGO Never mind , Sergeant . ( Tosses letter away ) I 'll do the searching . ( The SERGEANT leads AMYTIS before MAGO , who starts to pat her all over , in the manner of a detective frisking a yegg for his gun . MAGO stands so that his back is to the left of the stage , which AMYTIS faces . AMYTIS giggles hysterically . ) What are you laughing at ? AMYTIS ( Crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 79 MAGO ( Crosses to her ) You know  --  you 're rather beautiful . AMYTIS I always try to look my best when going to an execution . MAGO ( Significantly ) Maybe there wo n't be any execution , after all . Maybe I 'll take you down and show you the elephants . ( At this moment HANNIBAL comes in quietly at D.L. He sees MAGO and AMYTIS in the center of the stage , VARIUS , META and the soldiers at the back . AMYTIS sees him over MAGO 'S shoulder , but MAGO goes right on talking ) You know , I 've been waiting for a long time for someone like you to visit our camp . ( AMYTIS forces MAGO backwards to below column by poking him in the ribs as he talks . ) Hannibal wo n't let us officers associate with women who are our social inferiors , but you seem to be real aristocracy , as these things go in Rome . Why do you keep poking me ? ( AMYTIS points to HANNIBAL . MAGO turns around , sees his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salutes ) We caught a spy , sir  --  a Roman spy . HANNIBAL I was wondering AMYTIS You 're Hannibal , are n't you ! ( A statement , rather than a question. ) p. 80 HANNIBAL I am . ( Walks past her and crosses to L. of table . Presently AMYTIS follows him . ) AMYTIS ( Crosses to him ) So you 're Hannibal You 're not the way I pictured you , at all . HANNIBAL ( Politely ) I hope I 'm not a disappointment . MAGO We caught this woman red-handed , sir . She and these others were trying to sneak through our lines . HANNIBAL That was highly injudicious of you , madam  --  I mean , to be caught . AMYTIS I realize that now . MAGO I cross-examined her . AMYTIS He did not . He tickled me . MAGO It was my duty , sir , to search her person for any documents that might be of value . She chose to interpret my actions as a personal advance . AMYTIS He told me he was going to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughs . ) Scipio told me you never laugh . HANNIBAL Scipio has happened to encounter me only in my less mirthful moments . I must apologize for my brother , madam . He 's very young , and has much to learn about the gentle art of soldiering. p. 81 AMYTIS Oh , that 's all right . I understand perfectly . ( To MAGO ) You 're forgiven . HANNIBAL ( Sits L. of table ) In this delightful conversation that went on between you two , was any mention made of the possible penalty for espionage ? MAGO Of course there was . I sentenced all three of them to death . HANNIBAL ( Picks up map and reads it ) Is there any particular reason why this ceremony should be delayed ? MAGO ( Looking at AMYTIS ) There certainly is n't . HANNIBAL In that case , Sergeant , you may proceed in the usual manner . SERGEANT Come on , you ! ( He starts to lead her out . AMYTIS breaks away from him , goes to the table at which HANNIBAL is sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not asking for mercy , Hannibal . I know that there is no such thing in war . SERGEANT I told you to come with me . HANNIBAL Stand back , Sergeant . ( SERGEANT does so . ) Let her talk . p. 82 AMYTIS I 'm ready to die  --  for the glory of Rome , or whatever it is we 're figthing for now . I 'm not afraid  --  no , I mean that . I 'm really not afraid . That 's not heroism , either . It 's just the attitude of stoicism that comes to everyone , I suppose . Your soldiers who have been in battle must know what I mean . MAGO Must we listen to all this ? HANNIBAL ( Turning to AMYTIS , interested for the first time ) Go on . AMYTIS In Athens , when men were condemned to death , they were granted one last request  --  provided , of course , that it was within reason . If they wanted a sumptuous repast , they could have it . Or they might crave a last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . Some of these men were murderers , some traitors , but all were accorded the same final favor . It did n't amount to much  --  it cost the state nothing . But it did help to send those poor creatures out with a somewhat less anguished conscience . That 's what I ask of you , Hannibal  --  one final favor . MAGO Do n't listen to her , Hannibal . ( Leans against column ) She 's a bad woman . HANNIBAL What is it that you want ? AMYTIS ( Hesitantly ) I ca n't tell you before all these people . p. 83 MAGO I thought not . I tell you , Hannibal , she 's dangerous . I would n't listen to a word she says . HANNIBAL ( Rises ) Dismissed , Sergeant . ( Cross R. below table , carries map in his hand ) Take these prisoners with you . SERGEANT Yes , sir . Hup ! ( VARIUS and META are led out up R. by the CORPORAL and GUARDSMEN . ) AMYTIS Nothing will happen to them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prisoners . SERGEANT Yes , sir . ( He salutes and goes out up R. ) MAGO Well  --  what is it ? AMYTIS ( To HANNIBAL ) Does he have to stay ? HANNIBAL ( Smiling ) You may go , Mago . MAGO ( Ominously ) I would n't do this , Hannibal . ( Exits up R. ) ( For an instant , HANNIBAL regards AMYTIS in silence . Then he motions her gracefully to a chair L. of table across the table from him. ) p. 84 HANNIBAL ( Goes above table , places chair L. of it for AMYTIS ) Wo n't you  --  sit down ? AMYTIS Thanks . ( There is an awkward pause after she has seated herself L. of table . ) HANNIBAL ( Sits R. of table  --  rolls map ) I do n't wish to seem peremptory , but I happen to be quite busy these days , and I therefore urge that you come to the point with the least possible delay . You 'll forgive me , wo n't you ? AMYTIS Do n't mention it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impress upon you the fact that this indignity , to which you are necessarily submitted , is not intended as a personal affront . AMYTIS No ? HANNIBAL Oh , no . Not at all . We have nothing whatever against you as an individual ; at the same time , we ca n't possibly ignore your status as a representative of Rome . You see , it 's this way : there happens to be a war on just at present , the contending parties being Rome , on the one hand , and Carthage on the other . AMYTIS Oh , yes . My husband told me all about that to-day . p. 85 HANNIBAL Your husband should have told you something else before sending you out on this mission , whatever it is . He should have explained that there is an ancient law of warfare which prescribes instant death for all those caught in the act of espionage . If we violated that law , we should ourselves be guilty of delinquency , and Carthage would undoubtedly be expelled from the Mediterranean League . AMYTIS I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would . Now , if you will be so good AMYTIS You assume that my husband sent me on this mission . Do you know who my husband is ? HANNIBAL I 'm afraid I do n't . AMYTIS He is Fabius Maximus . HANNIBAL Oh . Fabius Maximus . One of the consuls . AMYTIS One of the consuls nothing . He 's the Dictator ! HANNIBAL Indeed ? AMYTIS Oh , yes ! HANNIBAL Oh , I had n't heard . Congratulations . AMYTIS Not at all . My husband did n't send me on this mission . In fact , he does n't even know I 'm here . He thinks I 'm on my way to Ostia to join my mother . You know what 's going on in Rome , of course . p. 86 HANNIBAL I hear occasionally from my agents in the city . AMYTIS So you use spies , too . HANNIBAL Oh , we all do . One of my finest officers is in Rome this minute , posing as a merchant from Antioch . AMYTIS You do n't say so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you like it ? HANNIBAL Charming ! AMYTIS He has probably informed you that you are not a particularly welcome guest in these parts . Why , to-day , when the cry of " Hannibal is at the gates " went up , the whole population turned out to curse you and the gods that brought you here . HANNIBAL The gods are blamed for everything . AMYTIS I do n't want you to think that I 'm disloyal to Rome . I 'm not really a Roman at all . I was born in Athens , and for some reason I 've never been able to understand the Roman ideals of civic virtue . They think I 'm an awful coward . Why , to-day they asked me to stay and die like a true Roman HANNIBAL To stay and die ? Is the situation as hopeless as all that ? AMYTIS We may as well be frank with each other , Hannibal . You know that the defenses of Rome have n't a chance against your army , and the Romans know it even better than you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you crossed the Alps . p. 87 HANNIBAL I suppose I should feel flattered . AMYTIS To-day , young Scipio described you as a superman , a god , against whom mortal strength is of no avail . I heard him say it  --  and that 's why I 'm here . I wanted , for once in my life , to see a superman . ( BALA enters up L. with tray of food  --  stands up C. by column until on a nod from HANNIBAL he advances below table , back to audience , and places tray on table . Then gets wine and one goblet from table up C. behind column and places them by HANNIBAL 'S side . Then gets second jar and cup  --  places them  --  retires up C. ) When I left Rome in disgrace , I had no intention of going to visit my mother . That was just an excuse  --  I led my slaves along the wrong road , deliberately . When your sentries captured me , they wanted to put me to death at once . I told them I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BALA ) I have n't yet heard what that message is . AMYTIS Oh , food ! How nice ! I 'm simply famished ! It was very thoughtful of you to have supper for me , Hannibal . HANNIBAL ( Elaborately polite ) I must apologize for the simplicity of the meal . We 're living on army rations , you know . ( Pours wine for her. ) p. 88 AMYTIS Army rations ! Why , it 's delicious ! We never have anything as good as this in Rome . We have to deny ourselves all luxuries on account of the war What marvellous wine ! HANNIBAL Yes , the wine is rather good . It 's a Spanish wine that we brought with us . There 's very little of it left , but we hope to replenish our supply to-morrow . AMYTIS In Rome ? ( HANNIBAL nods . AMYTIS laughs ) You wo n't find much of that in Rome or anything else , for that matter . HANNIBAL You do n't seem to be particularly patriotic . AMYTIS That 's what my husband has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , I take it , is a true patriot . AMYTIS Oh , one hundred per cent  --  at least . HANNIBAL He might be a trifle annoyed if he knew that you were having dinner with the archenemy of Rome . AMYTIS It takes less than that to annoy my husband . Poor Fabius ! But I can always talk him out of it . HANNIBAL He must be very fond of you . AMYTIS ( Continues to eat ) Oh I suppose so . It 's never really been what you 'd call an ideal love match . My father left me under Fabius ' protection , and our marriage was the inevitable result . Not that I cared , particularly . Being only a half-breed Roman , I had no choice in the matter . p. 89 HANNIBAL Have you never fallen in love with anyone ? AMYTIS No . I worshipped all the heroes of mythology , of course  --  but that does n't mean anything . HANNIBAL Your husband must be a hero in Rome . AMYTIS Possibly . I know I should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considerate husband . We 've got along well together . He 's had his interests and I well , I suppose it 's my own fault that I have n't had mine . ( Sips wine . ) HANNIBAL Any children ? AMYTIS That 's a subject we do n't discuss . HANNIBAL I beg your pardon . AMYTIS Am I boring you with all this ? HANNIBAL Not at all . It 's a rare treat . We have so few opportunities for polite conversation in the army . But I 'm afraid that the Sergeant is growing a trifle impatient out there . AMYTIS Do you know I 'd almost forgotten about the Sergeant . And my slaves , they 're out there , too . Poor things  --  they must be dying of hunger . Could n't you ? HANNIBAL Of course ! Bala , see that supper is served for the two prisoners , at once . They wo n't have much more time ! p. 90 BALA ( Salutes ) Yes , sir . AMYTIS And some of that Spanish wine , too . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them some of the Spanish wine , by all means . ( BALA bows and goes out up L. ) AMYTIS I 've completely forgotten what it was we were talking about . HANNIBAL As I remember , we discussed plans for putting you to death and you asked yes , that 's it ! You were going to ask one final favor . AMYTIS Of course ! HANNIBAL Are you ready now to issue a statement on that subject ? AMYTIS Before I do , I should like to ask you just one question . I may seem like a rather trivial question , but I hope you 'll answer it  --  not as a Carthaginian conqueror speaking to a Roman victim  --  but as one civilized human to another . HANNIBAL What is the question ? AMYTIS It is this : Why have you done it ? HANNIBAL Why have I done it ? Why have I done what ? AMYTIS Oh , everything that you 've done  --  fighting wars , winning battles why ? p. 91 HANNIBAL ( After a moment 's pause ) That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must have had some definite motive to inspire you . HANNIBAL But who cares about my motives ? It 's only my actual accomplishments that count . AMYTIS I care about your motives . HANNIBAL Why ? AMYTIS I just happen to be curious , that 's all . HANNIBAL I should think that my reasons would be fairly obvious . I came here to destroy Rome . Is n't that reason enough ? AMYTIS Is it enough to satisfy you ? HANNIBAL I ca n't see that that makes any difference . AMYTIS Oh  --  but it does . It makes an enormous difference . You know , some day you 'll have to reason this thing out with yourself . Some day , you 'll say to yourself , " Here , I 've marched three thousand miles , and crossed mountains and things , and spilt a lot of blood  --  and what good has it done ? " It would be most embarrassing if you had to admit to yourself that you 'd been wasting your time . HANNIBAL I 'm not supposed to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to content myself with a soldier 's rewards . p. 92 AMYTIS As , for instance ? HANNIBAL Well  --  when I get back to Carthage , I shall receive medals , and testimonial documents , and I shall be the guest of honor at state banquets , and AMYTIS Yes , and they 'll give you the key to the city . I know . My husband once was given the key to the city . We have it at home , somewhere . Take my word for it , it does n't do you any good . HANNIBAL I suppose not . Still it 's a nice sentiment . AMYTIS So that 's what you 've been striving for  --  fighting for all these years . A nice sentiment ! HANNIBAL If you choose to put it that way  --  yes . AMYTIS I do n't believe it . You 'll have to offer some better reason than that . HANNIBAL ( Pushes stool away from table  --  picks up map ) I 'm beginning to sympathize with your husband . By the way , what is your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my husband ? HANNIBAL I should n't care to live with a woman who asked so many questions . AMYTIS If you 'd only give me an intelligent answer , I 'd stop . p. 93 HANNIBAL ( Rises ) Perhaps I ca n't explain my actions . AMYTIS You do n't even know yourself ? HANNIBAL ( Crosses down L. , takes map with him , turns to AMYTIS ) That question of yours disturbed me a little I 've asked myself that same thing so many times . AMYTIS I rather imagined that you had . HANNIBAL ( Cross by chair R. of column , back against column ) One morning we were camped on the banks of the Rhone River . It was swollen with the spring floods . I had to get my army across  --  eighty thousand infantry , cavalry elephants  --  with all their supplies . We had no boats , of our own ; there were no bridges . On the opposite bank a howling mob of Gauls was waiting to slaughter us as we landed . From the south , a large Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small body of men upstream to get across as best they could and to attack the Gauls on their right flank . I was waiting for the  --  signal from that detachment , and wondering whether I should ever set foot on the opposite bank As I stood there , I asked myself , " Why do I do this ? Even if a miracle occurs , and we do cross the river , what then ? What will we have gained ? " ( Cross C. near her ) I did n't know . p. 94 AMYTIS But you did cross the river , did n't you , Hannibal ? HANNIBAL Yes  --  we routed the Gauls , and tricked the Romans , and marched on to the Alps . Have you ever tried to lead an elephant over a snow peak ? AMYTIS ( Laughs ) No  --  that 's one of the many adventures I 've missed . HANNIBAL ( Smiles ) Our men , who were accustomed to the fierce heat of Africa , had to plod through the Alpine snows , many of them in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the machinery of war with them , while the natives pushed avalanches down on our heads . When we came to the last line of mountains , and saw Italy spread out at our feet , I asked myself that same question . I 've never been able to find an answer . I 've watched our men slaughter the Romans in one terrible battle after another . Through all these years , I 've seen nothing but death  --  ( Crosses up R.C. , looks out at Rome )  --  death  --  and I 've never been able to find an answer . AMYTIS ( Looking downstage seriously ) Not even in the key to the city ? HANNIBAL ( Looking upstage ) For ten years I 've followed the road that leads to Rome  --  and it 's a hard road to travel , Amytis . It 's littered with the bones of dead men . ( Faces down to her ) Perhaps they know why they died . I do n't . ( AMYTIS rises , crosses , stands behind him. ) p. 95 AMYTIS And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannibal . There 's your goal  --  before you . You can see the lights of Rome clearly , ca n't you ? Even the lights seem to tremble with fear of Hannibal . They know that to-morrow they 'll be snuffed out forever . Poor little Rome HANNIBAL ( Turns to face her ) The Romans think that I 'm a cruel , merciless enemy . Well , I am . ( Crosses below stool of column L. ) AMYTIS ( Follows him down ) You 're terribly proud of that , are n't you ? HANNIBAL ( Turning to face her ) Proud of what ? AMYTIS Of the thought that you 're cruel  --  merciless  --  a big , terrifying brute . HANNIBAL The Romans have inflicted that reputation on me . AMYTIS And you 're trying hard to live up to it , are n't you ? HANNIBAL I 'm not sorry to have my enemies afraid of me . AMYTIS Do you want me to be afraid of you ? HANNIBAL I should like it better if you were the least bit more respectful . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 96 AMYTIS ( Follows him ) Have you any idea why I came here ? HANNIBAL I assume that you 're a spy if so , your methods of gaining information are inexcusably crude . AMYTIS I 'm not a spy . Ca n't you believe that ? I did n't come here to learn any military secrets . This is nothing but a pleasure trip . HANNIBAL A pleasure trip ! ( Up  --  stands by table ) With swift , violent death staring you in the face ? AMYTIS I saw the smoke from your camp this afternoon . HANNIBAL Well ? AMYTIS I saw the smoke  --  and I decided that I should like to see the fire . HANNIBAL Evidently you did n't consider the possibility that you might be burned . AMYTIS Oh , yes  --  I thought of that ! It made it all the more exciting . HANNIBAL You should have waited in Rome . There 'll be fire there to-morrow  --  the fire of divine vengeance . AMYTIS Divine vengeance ! So you 're doing this as a special favor to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why we 're winning . p. 97 AMYTIS You mean , that 's why the gods are on your side . HANNIBAL I suppose you know that that 's a sacrilege . AMYTIS Call it sacrilege or truth  --  what difference does it make ? You 're afraid of the truth , Hannibal . You 're afraid to face it , because the gods tell you to look the other way . HANNIBAL ( Scornfully ) Are the gods afraid of the truth ? AMYTIS Of course they are ; and they do n't want us mortals to be too intimate with it . When we know the truth , we ca n't know fear  --  and without fear , there can be no gods HANNIBAL ( Moving toward the gong on the table . He does not ring it ) I 'd better send for the Sergeant . You 've lived long enough . AMYTIS ( Hastily ) No , Hannibal  --  not yet . I 'm not quite ready to die . HANNIBAL ( Puts down mallet , crosses down to her  --  she is C. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth ? AMYTIS I do n't want to die until I have lived . That 's perfectly reasonable , is n't it ? HANNIBAL I can give you death  --  but I ca n't give you life . p. 98 AMYTIS How do you know you ca n't ? HANNIBAL Because I do n't know what it is . ( Crosses below her , goes down L.C. ) I do n't want to know . AMYTIS ( Follows ) I do want to know . I came here because I was determined to find out . HANNIBAL Mago was right , Amytis  --  you 're dangerous . AMYTIS That 's what they said of me in Rome . But it is n't so . I 'm not dangerous . I 'm only real . HANNIBAL You might be dangerous to me . AMYTIS Because you 're afraid I might make you real . HANNIBAL ( Faces front ) You ca n't do it . No one can . When I was a child , my father laid me on the altar of Ba-al and consecrated me to the destruction of Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual  --  I became a force , divinely inspired to crush the enemies of Carthage . AMYTIS You 're using the gods again  --  as an excuse for your own murders . HANNIBAL Those who kill for the glory of the gods are not murderers . AMYTIS Who told you that ? One of the high-priests , I suppose . p. 99 HANNIBAL No  --  Ba-al himself has spoken to me . ( Faces front ) Throughout my life I have been driven forward by his voice , saying , " Go on , Hannibal , go on , with sword and flame , until you have destroyed the glory of Rome . " AMYTIS That was n't the voice of Ba-al , Hannibal . That was the voice of the shopkeepers in Carthage , who are afraid that Rome will interfere with their trade . Hatred , greed , envy , and the passionate desire for revenge  --  those are the high ideals that inspire you soldiers , Roman and Carthaginian alike and when you realize the shameful futility of your great conquests , you turn around and attribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient in an emergency HANNIBAL ( Slightly nettled , throws map away , turns on her ) Why do you say all this to me ? Are you trying to drive me away from Rome with words ? AMYTIS I do n't care what happens to Rome . I 'm trying to find something in you , something great , something noble , something exciting . HANNIBAL And you expect to accomplish this by insulting me , by calling me a rotten murderer , blaspheming my gods . AMYTIS Good ! You 're getting angry at last . That 's an encouraging sign ! p. 100 HANNIBAL I 'm beginning to entertain an extreme dislike for you . If you 'll forgive me for saying so , you 're becoming something of a pest . AMYTIS I 've tried to be interesting . HANNIBAL You 've succeeded in being exceptionally irritating . I do n't want to hear any more . You 'll have to die . AMYTIS Right this minute ? HANNIBAL Yes . I 'll be glad to get it over with . AMYTIS But is n't this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No , I 'm sorry to say that is entirely according to regulations . AMYTIS Oh , I know that . But you ought not to kill me at once , without  --  without  --   --  HANNIBAL Without what ? I 've given you a meal , I 've answered your damned questions  --  what more can I do ? AMYTIS There 's a certain  --  a certain ceremony to be gone through with , is n't there ? HANNIBAL What sort of a ceremony ? AMYTIS But it  --  it 's so embarrassing to put it into words . HANNIBAL ( She turns from him ) Very well , I 'll count five . If you ca n't find words in that time , I 'm afraid the subject  --  whatever it is  --  will have to remain closed forever . One Two Three You 'd better hurry . Four ( She turns to him. ) p. 101 AMYTIS It 's no use  --  I ca n't say it , Hannibal . You 'd better call the Sergeant . ( There is a long pause , while HANNIBAL studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! ( He backs away from her ) Is that the ceremony you had in mind ? AMYTIS Of course it is  --  no soldier ever kills a woman until after  --  and especially if she happens to be attractive . HANNIBAL You rather fancy yourself , do n't you ? AMYTIS Naturally , I should n't have come here at all if I had been lacking in a certain amount of self-confidence . HANNIBAL I 'm sorry to disappoint you . I should have been delighted to justify your confidence if the circumstances had been more favorable for a  --  an event of this kind . AMYTIS More favorable ! How could any circumstances be more favorable ? Here you are  --  alone , in the night  --  with your triumphant army behind you , with Rome cringing at your feet . Here are you , Hannibal  --  and here am I ! ( He makes a step forward , toward her , and for a moment there is the suggestion that he has weakened . But he braces himself , and again steps back. ) p. 102 HANNIBAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to death and this time you wo n't be allowed to talk your way out of it . ( There is a piercing shriek off stage , followed by an incoherent rumble of gruff voices . META dashes in up R. She is sobbing hysterically . AMYTIS rushes to her and takes her and takes her in her arms , attempting to calm and comfort her . ) AMYTIS What is it ? What 's happened ? META ( Wildly ) Varius  --  save him AMYTIS ( She is C. HANNIBAL to her left . To HANNIBAL ) You gave me your word . ( VARIUS rushes in up R. , considerably dishevelled . He is followed by the SERGEANT and the FIRST GUARDSMAN and SECOND GUARDSMAN . ) HANNIBAL What is this , Sergeant ? SERGEANT He started a fight , sir . VARIUS ( Breathlessly ) One of the soldiers tried to attack her . AMYTIS ( Gasping with rage ) What did he do ? META ( Between sobs ) He tried to carry me away with him . ( DIM Lights. ) p. 103 VARIUS I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed him . VARIUS I knocked him down . META Then I ran here AMYTIS You poor darling . ( MAGO breezes in up left with CORPORAL . ) VARIUS Then they all went after me . AMYTIS ( To HANNIBAL ) Is this the way your men obey orders ? HANNIBAL ( To the SERGEANT ) I told you that you were to be responsible . MAGO ( Briskly ) What 's all this ? AMYTIS ( Flaming ) You were the one . You attacked her  --  you beast ! MAGO ( Startled ) Why , I did not . I AMYTIS Do n't try to lie out of it . I know your licentious ways . MAGO ( Bewildered ) Why  --  I do n't even know what happened . How could I AMYTIS You 'd have done the same thing to me if Hannibal had n't stopped you . p. 104 MAGO ( To HANNIBAL ) What is going on here , anyway ? HANNIBAL I should like very much to know , Sergeant , who attacked this girl ? AMYTIS He did it . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a beast ! HANNIBAL Never mind about that . What happened , Sergeant ? AMYTIS He 's a disgrace to the army ! That 's what he is . SERGEANT It was one of Hasdrubal 's men , sir . MAGO There ! Do you hear that ? SERGEANT He crept up in the darkness , sir , when we was n't looking , and tried to carry her off . ( META breaks out with a fresh burst of sobs . AMYTIS still holds her in her arms and comforts her . ) AMYTIS There , there , dear  --  it 's all right . He ca n't touch you now . ( She looks at MAGO as she says this . ) MAGO Will you please be quiet and listen to the Sergeant ? SERGEANT This man  --  ( Referring to VARIUS )  --  went after her before we knew what was up , and we figured we 'd better get him calmed down before he tried to fight the whole army . p. 105 HANNIBAL Where is the soldier who committed this indiscretion ? SERGEANT He ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Varius ! VARIUS I lost my temper , my lady . MAGO Well  --  are you satisfied that it was n't I ? AMYTIS I wish it had been . HANNIBAL That soldier will be put to death , Sergeant . MAGO For a little thing like that ? HANNIBAL It 's not a little thing . Loose conduct of this sort is not to be tolerated . There 's been too much of it in the army . It 's got to stop ! ( As he says this , he glances meaningly at AMYTIS . ) AMYTIS You 're quite right , Hannibal . That sort of thing ought to be discouraged . HANNIBAL You may go , Sergeant . ( DIM Lights Except C. Spots . ) SERGEANT ( Indicating VARIUS and META  --  crosses C. ) And how about them , sir ? HANNIBAL Take them with you . SERGEANT Come on . p. 106 META ( Quailing ) I  --  I 'm afraid . VARIUS You must n't be afraid , Meta . I wo n't leave you . HANNIBAL You 'll wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners are to be guarded more carefully . Do you understand ? SERGEANT Yes , sir . Hup ! VARIUS Come on , Meta . ( He puts his arm about her and leads her out up R. , followed by the SERGEANT and GUARDSMEN . CORPORAL stands in entrance , fumbles with curtain . ) AMYTIS ( Crosses up after them R. ) If anyone so much as lays a finger on her , I  --  I 'll MAGO ( Crosses after her ) You 'll what ? AMYTIS Are you still here ? ( Turns on him . ) MAGO ( Around her  --  upstage ) Yes  --  but I 'm going . And you 're coming along with me . Is n't she , Hannibal ? HANNIBAL Yes , you can take her out . AMYTIS Is it all over , Hannibal ? Am I going to die ? p. 107 HANNIBAL You 're going to die . MAGO Come on . ( He takes her toward the steps up right . ) AMYTIS ( Turning to HANNIBAL ) You 'll be sorry , Hannibal . ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) HANNIBAL Wait a minute , Mago . MAGO We must n't delay any longer . HANNIBAL Bring her here . MAGO ( Crosses down to him by column  --  AMYTIS crosses down , stands by table ) You have n't changed your mind ? HANNIBAL Give me your sword . ( MAGO draws his sword , a long dagger , and hands it to HANNIBAL . ) I 'm going to kill her myself . ( There is a shrill bugle call. , Outside the CORPORAL is seen changing guard . When this is over , the CORPORAL stands by the curtains at the back , prepared to lower them . ) I 'll send for you when it 's over . MAGO ( Crestfallen ) Ca n't I stay and watch ? HANNIBAL Go on , Mago . MAGO ( To AMYTIS ) It 's an honor to die by the hand of Hannibal . Perhaps you deserve it . ( There is a note of admiration in his voice . He goes out up R. The CORPORAL lowers the curtains , from behind , and as he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other. ) p. 108 HANNIBAL You 've called me a murderer . You say that I glory in my reputation for cruelty . Now I 'm going to justify that reputation . I shall give you the final satisfaction of knowing that Hannibal , the merciless conqueror of Rome , is not a myth Come here ( She advances to him L.C. slowly , but without hesitation . He clutches her throat with his left hand . His right hand holds the dagger . ) AMYTIS Why do you choose to have me die , this way ? ( LIGHTS Still Dimming . ) HANNIBAL I could n't trust Mago to do this . You might have told him some of the things you have told me . He might have weakened . AMYTIS Yes  --  Mago is a man . You , of course , are a god Perhaps some day you 'll discover that you 're a man , too , Hannibal  --  and not ashamed to weaken . Perhaps , some day , you 'll realize that there 's a thing called the human equation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human equation does not interest me . AMYTIS Because you do n't know what it is . If you could ever find it , you 'd know that all your conquests  --  all your glory  --  are only whispers in the infinite stillness of time  --  that Rome is no more than a tiny speck on the face of eternity  --  that the gods are the false images of the unimaginative and then you 'll wish that all that you 've done could be undone . p. 109 HANNIBAL ( Still grasping her throat ) Where can I go to find this human equation ? AMYTIS It is here  --  on earth  --  not on the heights of Olympus . HANNIBAL Perhaps I 'll find it  --  but never with you . You must die . ( Raises sword . ) AMYTIS War is death , Hannibal . Rome is dying , Carthage is dying  --  but we 're alive You can conquer men , Hannibal . You can conquer armies . But you ca n't conquer life . HANNIBAL You must die . AMYTIS Go out and destroy the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself  --  if you can . Then come back and kill me . ( A bugle is heard , blowing the Carthaginian version of " taps "  --  softly , slowly . Blows until curtain is down . ) ( HANNIBAL , using all his strength , tries to thrust her away from him and lifts the dagger higher , preparing to plunge it in her heart . She clings desperately to his arms . ) HANNIBAL ( His voice now tremulous ) You 're going to die ! AMYTIS Yes  --  I 'm going to die but not until to-morrow ( Her face is close to his  --  too close . He kisses her . ) ( Presently , AMYTIS draws away from him and gazes , unsmilingly , into his eyes . HANNIBAL raises the sword , thinks better of it , and throws the sword away , vehemently . Again he seizes her in his arms and kisses her. ) @x The scene is the same as Act II  --  the time , early the following morning . There is a roll of drums as the curtain rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , in conference . The SERGEANT and the FIRST and SECOND GUARDSMEN are at the back . MAHARBAL Would n't it be wise to assemble some siege machinery before we start ? HASDRUBAL Machinery be damned ! The Romans know they 're beaten already  --  that 's the main thing . We do n't need machinery to break  --  ( Drums stop )  --  down resistance that does n't exist . CARTHALO The Roman walls are thick . We 'll need battering rams at least . HASDRUBAL I suppose you think you know more about it than Hannibal does . If he wanted any battering rams , he 'd make ' em . MAHARBAL Then it will be up to the infantry to storm the walls . HASDRUBAL ( At column ) You wo n't need the infantry after I 've attacked . CARTHALO Our infantry has the right to occupy the city first . We 've earned that privilege . ( HANNIBAL enters up L. , and stands behind the column , so that he is unseen by the others. ) p. 112 MAHARBAL ( Hotly ) How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow the cavalry in ? ( HANNIBAL leans L. of column , looks at D.L. door , not noticing the argument . ) HASDRUBAL ( Even more hotly ) What are you talking about ? The Numidian cavalry corps is going in first , and by the gods CARTHALO ( Cutting in ) They will not ! The infantry has done all the heavy work in this war . ( HANNIBAL crosses down L.C. below chest , stands looking at the men . ) HASDRUBAL ( Cutting in ) The heavy work , eh ! Who did the heavy work at Trasimenus  --  who did the heavy work at Can nae , who MAHARBAL ( Cutting in ) The infantry , not the cavalry . We deserve to go into Rome first . CARTHALO Of course we do . You always want all the honors for your damned cavalry . ( HANNIBAL steps from behind the column C. SERGEANT sees him . ) SERGEANT ' Tshun ! ( He and the three officers salute. ) p. 113 CARTHALO You can settle this , sir . HANNIBAL Settle what ? HASDRUBAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , sir . They think they 're going to occupy the city first . The infantry ! MAHARBAL It 's the infantry 's job . The cavalry is only supposed  --   --  CARTHALO And besides , my men can be trusted to do it right . They  --   --  I think this can be settled without bloodshed  --   --  HASDRUBAL The cavalry goes in first . MAHARBAL The infantry wo n't stand for it . HANNIBAL ( Below column ) We 'll do it this way . You 'll attack the city from the west , Hasdrubal . You attack them from the south , Carthalo , and you from the north , Maharbal . We can send Mago against the east gate . All the Romans will concentrate there , to watch the elephants . The rest of you will break in easily ! CARTHALO But which of us is to go in first ? HANNIBAL You can all start at the same time  --  and the first one to reach the Forum  --  will win a prize . HASDRUBAL What is the prize ? p. 114 HANNIBAL I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime , you can fall your men in . MAHARBAL Yes , sir . HANNIBAL Wait for further orders . CARTHALO Yes , sir . ( The three of them salute and go out up R. ) HASDRUBAL ( As they go ) The cavalry will go in first . CARTHALO Not by a damned sight . MAHARBAL We 'll see who wins that prize . ( They are all talking at once as they disappear from view . ) HANNIBAL ( Crosses to table , takes some grapes from bowl , begins eating them ) Pack up this equipment , Sergeant . SERGEANT Yes , sir ! Get busy , you ! ( The FIRST and SECOND GUARDSMEN start to pack up the maps , armor , etc. , placing them in a large chest L. of C. , which they carry out up R. ) HANNIBAL Have your men ready in half an hour . ( Crosses C. ) ( BALA comes in up L. , bearing a tray of food , which he deposits on the table. ) p. 115 SERGEANT Full marching order , sir ? HANNIBAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packs on the wagon . SERGEANT Yes , sir . ( He salutes and goes out up R. ) HANNIBAL Bala send those Roman slaves in to me . ( BALA goes out up R. HANNIBAL is standing by the table , eating bread and drinking wine , this being his hasty breakfast . The change in his manner must be apparent : he is now gay , buoyant , carefree and reluctant to concentrate on the serious business at hand . He has the air of one who does n't much care whether school keeps or not . He glances toward the left . VARIUS and META come in up R. hesitantly . Their hands are tightly clasped , as though they are clinging to each other in the face of a common danger . BALA follows them in . ) VARIUS You sent for us , sir ? HANNIBAL Yes ! You 're wanted in there . ( He nods toward the left . VARIUS and META go out door L. During this , and subsequent scenes , there is almost constant movement outside the temple . The GUARDSMEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various kinds . There must be the sense of intensive action  --  of rapid but systematic preparation for the battle that is imminent . ) Get your kitchen packed up , Bala  --  then come back and get my things . ( BALA exits up L. ) ( MAGO comes in up R. quietly at the back , leans against one of the pillars , folds his arms , and looks at HANNIBAL , who is still standing , hastily gulping his breakfast . MAGO is attired in a shiny new uniform. ) p. 116 MAGO Well ? HANNIBAL ( Turns and sees MAGO ) Oh , hello  --  Mago . MAGO You 're a fine example , you are . What have you got to say for yourself now ? HANNIBAL Nothing , Mago . It would take years to explain this . MAGO You 're darned right it would . ( No . Two GUARDSMAN crosses with duffle bag up R. ) HANNIBAL What did you think had happened last night ? MAGO ( Indignantly ) What did I think had happened ? What else could I think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for you to send for me . HANNIBAL You should n't have waited . MAGO When I finally looked in here , the room was empty . Even my own supper was all eaten up . HANNIBAL ( With a glance toward the L. ) She ate it . MAGO Of all the damned outrages ! HANNIBAL ( A step to MAGO ) You can eat breakfast here , if you want , to make up for the supper you missed . The army moves in half an hour . p. 117 MAGO The elephants are ready . HANNIBAL And incidentally  --  perhaps it would be just as well if MAGO Oh , do n't worry about that . I wo n't say a word . HANNIBAL ( Laughing ) Thanks . ( Starts to exit up R. ) MAGO You know , Hannibal , I ca n't understand it . ( HANNIBAL stops up C. ) It 's the first serious mistake you 've ever made . HANNIBAL I 've made many mistakes , Mago  --  but this is n't one of them . ( He goes out R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUARDSMAN , with bag , crosses behind him . MAGO sits down L. of table and starts to eat . He chuckles to himself . AMYTIS comes in through the door D.L. She is wearing the Phoenician nightgown , and a brilliant blue cloak . She passes behind the column , going to the right to gaze out after HANNIBAL . MAGO has not seen her . She turns to him . He is still chuckling . ) AMYTIS Good morning . ( MAGO starts to rise . ) MAGO ( With no enthusiasm ) Oh ! Good morning . ( Sits again. ) p. 118 AMYTIS Having breakfast ? ( AMYTIS is also a changed person . There are no evidences of her cheerful flippancy . She is langorous , meditative , reserved . ) MAGO Yes . Ca n't I persuade you to have a little something to eat ? AMYTIS Thanks , I will . ( She sits down R. of table with MAGO and joins in the repast ) What were you laughing at when I came in ? MAGO I was just thinking what Rome will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( A soft bugle call is heard . ) AMYTIS There 'll be nothing left , will there ? MAGO ( Finishing a mouthful ) Nothing . First , we 'll slaughter the men . When we 've got them out of the way , we 'll start plundering and see what we can pick up in the way of loot . After that , we 'll set fire to the houses . And then AMYTIS Oh , I know what comes next . MAGO Exactly . After we 've disposed of everything else , we 'll turn to the women . Are there any attractive women in Rome ? AMYTIS ( After a moment 's thought ) Oh  --  any number of them . A trifle unimaginative , perhaps  --  but still , attractive . p. 119 MAGO Do you think they 'll be attracted to me ? AMYTIS I do n't quite see how they can avoid it . After all MAGO Oh , I know what you mean . You mean , they wo n't dare refuse . AMYTIS That 's about it , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing  --  force , I mean . I like to feel that it 's sort of  --  sort of mutual . Do you understand ? AMYTIS I do , indeed . MAGO I mean to say  --  I like to think that they 're giving in cheerfully . AMYTIS There 's no question of that . You look magnificent in that gorgeous new uniform . MAGO ( Up ) Do you really think so ? As a matter of fact , I 've been saving that up for the entry into Rome . ( Crosses C. and poses ) To-day the women of Rome will feast their eyes on a real Carthaginian soldier . AMYTIS I 'm sure that the women of Rome will be duly appreciative . MAGO ( Sitting down again L. of table ) Hannibal will probably make me change back to my old uniform . He 's always telling me not to show off . p. 120 AMYTIS To-night , when you run wild in Rome , will Hannibal join in the general merriment ? MAGO If you 'll allow me to say so , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in quickly up R. and crosses to up C. and salutes . ) SERGEANT Beg pardon , sir . MAGO What is it ? SERGEANT Some Romans , sir . ( MAGO springs up . ) MAGO Romans ? Attacking ? SERGEANT No , sir . It 's a delegation of ' em , under a flag of truce . MAGO Send for Hannibal , quick ! He 's down conferring with Hasdrubal . SERGEANT Yes , sir . ( He goes to the back and calls out to the THIRD GUARDSMAN ) Hey , you ! ( The THIRD GUARDSMAN appears U.R. ) Run down to Hasdrubal 's tent and tell the commander-in-chief that there 's a delegation of Romans here  --  and make it fast ! ( The THIRD GUARDSMAN dashes off . ) MAGO ( Turning to AMYTIS  --  crosses to table , stands ) Do you know anything about this ? p. 121 AMYTIS I have n't the faintest idea what MAGO It 's some damned trick , and you 're part of it . Are they armed , Sergeant ? SERGEANT Oh , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MAGO What did they say ? SERGEANT They just said they 'd like to see the commander-in-chief . MAGO Did you get their names ? SERGEANT Only the leader  --  said his name was Fabius Maximus . AMYTIS ( Terrified ) My husband ! ( She jumps up . ) MAGO A-ha ! So you do know something ? AMYTIS I 've got to get out of here . ( She hurries toward D.L. door . ) MAGO You 'd better not try to communicate with your husband . AMYTIS ( Hastily ) Do n't worry . I wo n't . ( She goes out through the door L. MAHARBAL appears up R. ) MAGO ( Muttering ) Damn her soul . I 'd like to ( Below column. ) p. 122 MAHARBAL ( Comes in up R.  --  crosses down C. ) What do you suppose they want ? MAGO I do n't know . It looks pretty suspicious . MAHARBAL They 'd better not try any of their tricks on Hannibal . SERGEANT Shall I bring ' em , sir ? MAHARBAL Yes , bring them in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.L. ) CARTHALO ( Entering up R.  --  runs C. ) The runner just told me . MAHARBAL Is Hannibal coming ? CARTHALO Yes . MAGO I tell you , Maharbal , we 'll have to stand by Hannibal now . MAHARBAL Nonsense . This does n't mean anything . These Romans are just making a last desperate attempt to save themselves . CARTHALO It 's their only hope . MAGO ( Desperately ) But I tell you , Hannibal is not himself He MAHARBAL ( Reassuringly ) Calm down , Mago , calm down . It 'll be all right . Hannibal is still Hannibal . ( The SERGEANT appears . There is a roll of drums , which continues until HANNIBAL 'S entrance. ) p. 123 SERGEANT This way ( FABIUS enters , followed by SCIPIO , DRUSUS , the CORPORAL and FOUR GUARDSMEN . The Romans salute ; the Carthaginians return the greeting . The GUARDSMEN , with swords drawn , take up positions by the columns at the back , remaining there , rigidly at attention , throughout the ensuing scene . ) ( FABIUS is obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back at any moment . He looks apprehensively toward MAGO , MAHARBAL and CARTHALO , who are at the right . ) ( SCIPIO also regards them , but there is a belligerent flash in his eye . He had objected strenuously to this attempt at compromise , and during the parley he shows his impatience and dissatisfaction with the whole proceeding . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Clearing his throat ) Which of you is Hannibal ? CARTHALO Hannibal will be here directly . MAHARBAL You 're wasting your time , Romans . You 'd better go back and defend your city . SCIPIO Do you hear that , Fabius ? He 's right ! DRUSUS Hush , Scipio ! Let Fabius do the talking . ( SOFTEN Drum . ) SERGEANT ' Tshun ! p. 124 SCIPIO There he is ! ( HANNIBAL enters , followed by HASDRUBAL . The Carthaginians and Romans salute , sharply . HANNIBAL , very erect and very serious , confronts his enemies . ) HANNIBAL Which one of you is Fabius Maximus ? FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Pleased ) I am . HASDRUBAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sir " ! ( DRUMS Stop . ) HANNIBAL ( Gazing intently at FABIUS ) So you 're Fabius Maximus . That explains a great deal . ( He sits down at the table . The others remain standing . ) HASDRUBAL Come on , speak up ! What do you want ? FABIUS MAXIMUS We came here under a flag of truce , sir . We felt that we might talk this over in a civilized manner . HANNIBAL I can see no objection to that . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Getting over his first nervousness ) Here you are , Hannibal , at the gates of Rome , with a mighty army  --  an admirable army . Even though we are your enemies , we 'll cheerfully admit that . p. 125 HASDRUBAL Never mind the soft soap . What do you want ? FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Expanding ) For years , Rome and Carthage have been at each other 's throats , in a death struggle , gentlemen , a death struggle . Thousands upon thousands of men  --  on both sides  --  have sacrificed their lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the conflict seems to have reached what I may reasonably call at crisis . HANNIBAL You are not overstating it . FABIUS MAXIMUS As I have already pointed out , here you stand at the gates of Rome , and confronting our army , which is of sufficient strength to defend the city for months . HASDRUBAL That 's a damned lie . You could n't hold out for an hour . HANNIBAL Never mind that , Hasdrubal . Go on . FABIUS MAXIMUS You may not realize the full strength of our defending force . We now have , within the city , twenty war-strength legions , fully armed and prepared . HASDRUBAL Do n't listen to him , Hannibal . Twenty legions ! Do you expect us to believe that ? Why , you have two legions , at the outside , and home guard at that . There 's not a man in ' em who is n't a great-grandfather , at least . p. 126 HANNIBAL Keep quiet , Hasdrubal . I 'll hold up our end of the conversation . Now , what else have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the physical advantages of our position . You must know that the walls of Rome are practically impregnable . HANNIBAL Well ? FABIUS MAXIMUS Well , then  --  what will be gained by a long , arduous , painful siege ? Nothing , my dear sir , but acute suffering on both sides . We will sacrifice the lives of many gallant young soldiers , and so will you . And at the same time , there are the innocent victims to be thought of  --  the women , and the little children . What of them ? This is not their war , Hannibal . They did n't start it . They have no axe to grind with you . Why must they be made to pay the terrible price of pitched battle ? HANNIBAL What do you suggest we do about all this ? FABIUS MAXIMUS I suggest that you abandon the idea of capturing Rome . The attempt would cost you heavily and would be doomed to ultimate failure . HASDRUBAL In other words , we 're to lay down our arms and go home ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not exactly that . We realize that the war must be brought to a logical conclusion . But we do suggest that you move to some spot , not quite so near the city , where we can meet you honorably on the field of battle . p. 127 HASDRUBAL How about those twenty legions of yours ? Why do n't you send them out here and let us fight it out ? FABIUS MAXIMUS We shall be glad to do that , in due time . HASDRUBAL Do you hear that ? In due time ! He wants us to wait until he can get his armies back from Capua and Spain . ( HASDRUBAL , MAHARBAL and CARTHALO laugh . ) HANNIBAL Have you any further suggestions ? FABIUS MAXIMUS No  --  I think that 's about all . HASDRUBAL Well , it is n't enough . If you think you can beg us off with a few hollow words , you 're dammed well mistaken . Our army is mobilized at this minute  --  forty thousand men , waiting for the order to move . Within an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see what sort of defense your twenty legions can put up . SCIPIO ( Bursting at this ) Twenty legions or not  --  we 'll show you that we can fight better than we can talk ! DRUSUS Keep out of this , Scipio . Leave it to Fabius . SCIPIO ( Crosses C. ) I ca n't keep out of it . I 've fought against you , Hannibal , at Trasimenus and Can nae , and by the gods , I 'll fight against you again ! p. 128 FABIUS MAXIMUS Scipio  --  please ! SCIPIO ( Turning to FABIUS and DRUSUS ) Hasdrubal is right . We ca n't stand them off with hollow words . We never should have come out here in the first place . Let them come to us . DRUSUS Hold your tongue , Scipio . You 'll spoil everything . HANNIBAL I seem to detect a slight note of dissension . FABIUS MAXIMUS Oh , no , not at all . Scipio just felt that it was unwise for us to talk this over with you . HASDRUBAL Scipio seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't more of them in Rome . SCIPIO ( To FABIUS ) I told you not to listen to that damned woman . She put the idea into your head . HANNIBAL ( Interested ) What damned woman ? FABIUS MAXIMUS It was just a personal matter , I assure you . SCIPIO She was the one who suggested it . HANNIBAL Who was ? FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Crosses C. SCIPIO to L. ) As a matter of fact , sir , it was my wife . p. 129 HANNIBAL Oh ! Your wife ! MAGO I thought so . It was his wife ! HANNIBAL Keep quiet , Mago . FABIUS MAXIMUS She had the idea that you might consider this matter reasonably . SCIPIO She 's a cowardly Greek herself , and she succeeded in converting Fabius to her point of view . HANNIBAL Fabius must be a model husband . But , after all , these domestic affairs are not of vital importance to us at the moment . HASDRUBAL You 're damned right they are n't . Send these men back , Hannibal . The army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HANNIBAL We 'll have to wait . I want time to think some things over . HASDRUBAL You do n't have to give this a second thought  --  why , it 's ridiculous on the face of it . HANNIBAL Nevertheless , I intend to think it over . Mago , take these gentlemen down and show them the elephants . They might be interested . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Apprehensively ) You 're not going to violate the flag of truce ? HANNIBAL No  --  no . You 'll be as safe here as you are in Rome safer . p. 130 MAGO ( Reluctantly ) Come on . ( He leads the three Romans out U.R . They are followed by the CORPORAL and the THREE GUARDSMEN . ) HASDRUBAL You 're not going to be taken in by what those damned Romans said , are you ? You ca n't delay the destruction of Rome another day . It would mean mutiny . HANNIBAL You heard your orders . ( There bugle calls are heard . HASDRUBAL , MAHARBAL and CARTHALO go out . ) You can wait outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMYTIS comes in D.L. ) AMYTIS Do n't believe a word of it , Hannibal . They have n't twenty legions in the city , or anything like it . HANNIBAL I know all that . AMYTIS Poor Fabius . I can just picture him brooding over that suggestion of mine . I made it quite casually . He probably worried about it all night , trying to persuade himself and Scipio and the others that I was right . HANNIBAL Why did you make that suggestion ? Why did you think I 'd listen to reason ? AMYTIS I do n't know . Why did I think so last night , for that matter ? p. 131 HANNIBAL You seem to guess right most of the time . AMYTIS I have one more favor to ask , Hannibal . HANNIBAL Is it as reasonable as the first one ? AMYTIS It 's about my slaves  --  I want them to go back to their homes  --  to be free . Will you take them with you ? HANNIBAL Where do they come from ? AMYTIS From Sicily . HANNIBAL I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and summons VARIUS and META , who come in at once . ) AMYTIS Hannibal is going to send you to Sicily . You 're to be free . META Free  --  to go home ? VARIUS And to be married ? AMYTIS You 'll be free to do anything you please . HANNIBAL You 'll find Bala outside . ( Sits R. end of chest . ) META ( Kneels ) Good-bye , my lady  --  and thank you . VARIUS May the gods bless you for being good to us. p. 132 AMYTIS Be good to each other  --  and forget that you were ever slaves in Rome . META We shall never forget you , my lady  --  or your kindness . AMYTIS Good-bye , both of you . I want you to be happy . ( They go out U.R. ) I 'm glad they 're to be saved . HANNIBAL You too can be saved , Amytis  --  if you choose . AMYTIS If I choose ? HANNIBAL Did you hear my conversation with your husband ? AMYTIS Yes  --  I heard it all . HANNIBAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you your cohice . Last night , I should have put you to death . I should n't have listened to a ward of protest or persuasion . But I did listen  --  and you did n't die . This morning , it is different . I ca n't destroy Rome until I know what your choice is to be . I will spare your husband 's life . You can go back to him , and I 'll see that you both are allowed to escape  --  to go wherever you please . That 's one part of your choice , Amytis . AMYTIS And the other part ? HANNIBAL To go with me . To forget Rome  --  to forget Carthage  --  to be with me , forever . p. 133 AMYTIS And if I agree to that part of it , will Rome be spared ? HANNIBAL ( Emphatically ) No ! Whatever your choice , Rome must be destroyed ! AMYTIS Then I choose to go back to my husband . Go ahead with your great work , Hannibal . Burn Rome to the ground ; obliterate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure Rome stays destroyed . Instruct your men to crush any blade of grass , any flower that dares to thrust its head above the ashes of the dead city . Prolong your victory . Glory in it till your dying day . But do n't ever look to me , or to my memory , for sympathy or applause . HANNIBAL ( Angrily ) I think I understand you at last . You came here to save Rome . If you fail in that , you 're prepared to die . For all your talk , you care nothing for me . AMYTIS You must n't believe that , Hannibal . ( There is a shrill bugle call . ) HANNIBAL You thought you could save Rome from the destiny that is ready to overwhelm it ! You have tried to build walls of words as a defense against my army . AMYTIS I 'm not trying to save Rome , Hannibal . I 'm trying to save you . HANNIBAL Why do you imagine that I 'm worth saving ? p. 134 AMYTIS Because I want to have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carthage remember you as a great general . I want to remember you as a conqueror who could realize the glory of submission . HANNIBAL ( Challenging ) And does Rome realize the glory of submission ? AMYTIS No , and for that very reason Rome will destroy itself . Success is like a strong wine , Hannibal ; give a man enough of it , and he 'll drink himself to death . Rome will do that , too , if you leave it alone . HANNIBAL So I 'm to leave Rome  --  and to leave you . Is that your choice ? AMYTIS Yes , Hannibal  --  to leave me with something beautiful  --  something that is worth remembering . I do n't want you to spoil that . HANNIBAL And what shall I have to remember ? That I marched three thousand miles  --  and failed ? AMYTIS Ah , but that 's just the point , Hannibal . You have n't failed . HANNIBAL I came to conquer Rome . Anything short of that is failure . AMYTIS Are you sure of that ? Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find your own soul ? HANNIBAL My own soul does n't matter , Amytis . I myself amount to nothing . All of us amount to nothing . We stand aside and watch ourselves parade by ! We 're proud of the brave manner in which we step forward , and of the nobility of our bearing , and the sparkle of divine fire that is in our eyes  --  and actually we have no more idea of where we 're going , no more choice in the matter , than so many drops of water in a flowing river . p. 135 AMYTIS Yes , and at the end of that river is an endless sea of things that are passed . It is called history . When you reach that sea , other drops of water may murmur respectfully , " Here comes Hannibal , the conqueror of Rome . " But you wo n't care . You 'll only be thankful for the interludes that you have known  --  the moments when you drifted from the main current and found peace and contentment in the deep , quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . With sudden , fierce strength , HANNIBAL takes her in his arms . ) HANNIBAL I 'll turn away from Rome now , Amytis , if you 'll come with me . Rome can live , Amytis . You can save it . AMYTIS I do n't want it to be that way . HANNIBAL I 'll bury my sword before the gates of Rome . I 'll hand over my command to Hasdrubal . I 'll do the one thing I thought was impossible ! I 'll quit when I 'm winning . But I ca n't do this alone I ca n't . AMYTIS No , Hannibal . I do n't want it to be that way . I do n't want Rome to be saved because I made this choice . I want you to do it  --  to make the decision  --  to prove that you are stronger than your own victorious army . HANNIBAL If I recognize your truths , I 'll have to believe that all my life has been wasted , that all those men who have fallen along the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to believe that ? p. 136 AMYTIS I do ! I do ! I want you to believe that every sacrifice made in the name of war is wasted . When you believe that , you 'll be a great man . ( Gently she strokes his hair ) I want you to be a great man . ( He kisses her , desperately . ) MAGO ( Offstage ) Hannibal ! ( MAGO comes in U.R. , sees them embrace , and turns away . HANNIBAL slowly relinquishes his grip on AMYTIS and steps back . ) HANNIBAL You were right , Mago . I should have let you put her to death without further delay . MAGO I 'm glad you realize that at last . You see  --  I 've had a lot more experience in these matters than you 've had . I understand the risks . HANNIBAL Evidently . MAGO It is n't too late to punish her , even now . ( HANNIBAL crosses to the table . ) HANNIBAL ( Two GUARDS enter up R. He beats the gong ) Perhaps it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your decision . ( BALA enters U.L. with HANNIBAL 'S helmet. ) p. 137 HANNIBAL Send Thothmes here . ( BALA bows and goes out U.L. ) MAGO And the Romans ? HANNIBAL Bring them here to me . MAGO Yes , sir . ( He goes out U.R. ) AMYTIS I must go . My husband must n't find me here  --  he  --  he 'd die of shame . ( The FIRST and SECOND GUARDSMEN enter U.R. , taking positions at either side of the main entrance . ) HANNIBAL Put that woman under arrest . ( The two GUARDSMEN take her arms and hold her . She is at the left , upstage . THOTHMES comes in U.L. with documents . ) AMYTIS Hannibal  --  you ca n't do this . Let me go ! THOTHMES You sent for me , sir . HANNIBAL Have you your records with you ? THOTHMES Yes , sir . They 're all here . ( MAGO comes in U.R. , followed by the CORPORAL , three GUARDSMEN , and the three Romans . As FABIUS enters AMYTIS shrinks back , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 138 HANNIBAL Did you see the elephants ? FABIUS MAXIMUS Oh , yes , indeed . It was quite a treat . DRUSUS We do n't see elephants around here very often . ( FABIUS sees AMYTIS . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS Amytis ! ( He starts toward her ) In the name of all the gods , what are you doing here ? AMYTIS Fabius ! I did n't want you to HANNIBAL ( Harshly ) Our sentries arrested this woman . She represented herself as your wife . FABIUS MAXIMUS She is my wife ! Amytis , why did you come here ? HANNIBAL She told me that she was concerned for your safety . She came to find you . FABIUS MAXIMUS Amytis ! My true , my loyal wife . Do you hear that , Scipio ? She came to find me ! AMYTIS I ca n't let you believe . HANNIBAL ( Quickly ) She evidently told us the truth . There is no reason why we should suspect the wife of Fabius Maximus . You may release her . ( The GUARDSMEN release AMYTIS and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where she remains until the end . HASDRUBAL , MAHARBAL and CARTHALO come in briskly , followed by the SERGEANT. ) p. 139 HASDRUBAL The army is ready to attack . HANNIBAL ( To FABIUS ) I 'm issuing an order in which you may be interested . FABIUS MAXIMUS ( Tremulously ) You 're not going to HANNIBAL The Carthaginian army will proceed at once to Capua . HASDRUBAL ( Wildly ) We 're not going into Rome ? HANNIBAL No  --  we are not . HASDRUBAL What in the name of all the gods is the matter with you ? Have you lost every atom of judgment ? HANNIBAL I 've lost nothing , Hasdrubal  --  except a few perverted notions about various things . I could afford to lose those . HASDRUBAL I wo n't stand for it ! Do you hear that ? I wo n't stand for it ! You can take your goddamned army to Capua . My cavalry will attack Rome this morning  --  MAHARBAL I 'll go with you , Hasdrubal . CARTHALO So will I. HASDRUBAL There ! Do you hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They know what it would mean to turn back now . They have n't lost control of their senses . p. 140 MAHARBAL ( Angrily ) The trouble with you , sir , is that you know how to gain victories , but not how to use them . CARTHALO Hasdrubal is absolutely right , sir . You 'd better do as he says . ( Both men are speaking at the same time , so that there is a jumble of angry voices . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS Gentlemen  --  gentlemen ! Might I say a word ? HASDRUBAL ( Turns to FABIUS ) Shut up ! HANNIBAL So you propose to destroy Rome by yourselves ? HASDRUBAL We do  --  and by the gods , we 'll take you with us . You 've led us all this way . And you 'll see it through , if we have to force you into it at the point of a sword . ( HASDRUBAL draws his sword and confronts HANNIBAL . ) HANNIBAL ( Quietly , but with tremendous emphasis ) Hasdrubal  --  you 'll do as I say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoarsely ) We ca n't do it , Hannibal . Even if we gave the orders , the men would n't move away from Rome now . After four years of steady fighting , they wo n't be cheated out of their reward . p. 141 HANNIBAL You and Maharbal and Carthalo and all the others in this army have the misfortune to be soldiers . You ca n't break away from the habit of obedience . You 'll do as I say . HASDRUBAL Do n't put that order through , Hannibal . Do n't  --  do n't ! It 'll be the end of all of us  --  of Carthage itself  --  and a rotten , humiliating end , too . HANNIBAL The army moves to Capua at once . Go tell your men to fall in . HASDRUBAL I 've never disobeyed an order , Hannibal . What 's more , when you 've given me a command , I 've never even stopped to ask you why you gave it . I 've accepted everything from you , as though it were the word of Ba-al himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this spot until You tell me why we are turning away from Rome . HANNIBAL ( Vaguely ) Everyone seems to be so damned curious about my motives . HASDRUBAL You owe that much to me  --  to every man in this sweating army . Tell us why  --  why ? ( HANNIBAL , suddenly collected , steps forward toward HASDRUBAL . ) HANNIBAL I 'll tell you why , Hasdrubal . I 've had a portent . ( He says this mysteriously. ) p. 142 HASDRUBAL ( Awed ) A portent ? CARTHALO ( Even more awed ) From the gods ? HANNIBAL Yes  --  a portent from the gods . MAHARBAL From Ba-al ? HANNIBAL No  --  from Tanit , the daughter of Ba-al . ( This last with a furtive glance toward AMYTIS . ) HASDRUBAL Then there is no hope . If Ba-al has sent his daughter to rule our destiny , then we are lost , forever . HANNIBAL ( Speaking now directly at AMYTIS , as though they again were alone ) She told me to look for the human equation . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all your conquests , all your glory , are but whispers in the infinite stillness of time  --  that Rome is only a speck on the face of eternity . CARTHALO The gods speak strangely . HANNIBAL She told me that I must realize the glory of submission . I could only obey . HASDRUBAL The gods are cruel . HANNIBAL Cruel , but convenient , in an emergency . ( AMYTIS smiles tenderly . ) We 're going to Capua  --  to rest . We need rest , more than we need Rome . Get to your posts ! ( HASDRUBAL steps forward and confronts FABIUS , menacingly. ) p. 143 HASDRUBAL ( To FABIUS ) The Carthaginian army retreats , for the first time . But do n't try to take credit for that , you Romans ! Do n't ever forget that it was only the gods themselves who saved Rome from the strength of our swords . ( He turns , salutes HANNIBAL , and strides out U.R. , followed by MAHARBAL and CARTHALO . ) ( MAGO ambles in a leisurely manner across the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portent , did he ? ( He turns to HANNIBAL ) That 's a new name for it . ( He salutes and goes out . ) HANNIBAL Fall in the guard , Sergeant . SERGEANT Yes , sir . Hup ! ( The SERGEANT , CORPORAL and GUARDSMEN march out U.R. ) HANNIBAL ( To THOTHMES ) Give me your records , Thothmes . ( THOTHMES hands him the records . ) You may go . ( THOTHMES goes out . Three bugles are heard . HANNIBAL looks through the sheets of papyrus , and then turns to the Romans ) I have here a complete record of our march , from Carthage to the gates of Rome . I need hardly explain to you that this is a document of great historical importance . That being the case ( He tears the sheets into small pieces ) It is now no longer a document of any importance whatever . The exploits of Hannibal 's magnificent army will live only as long as our own memory survives . That 's the end of the story , gentlemen . p. 144 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . HANNIBAL What difference does it make ? In the end , there 'll be more than enough history to go ' round . SCIPIO I have seen you before , Hannibal  --  in battle . Gods or no gods  --  it is not like you to do this  --  to retreat . ( HANNIBAL takes sword from table . ) HANNIBAL I 'm leaving Rome to an enemy that is crueller even than I am . I shall allow Rome to destroy itself . SCIPIO Perhaps we 'll have the chance to fight it out some day . HANNIBAL ( Bowing ) I 'm afraid so . ( He walks slowly to the back , then turns ) Fabius , I wish happiness and prosperity to you , your wife , and your sons . FABIUS MAXIMUS Thank you  --  but I have no sons . HANNIBAL You may have and if you do , I hope that your first-born will inherit the qualities of greatness that were so evident in his father  --  that he will duplicate his father 's signal triumphs and that he , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to AMYTIS ) It is so much more beautiful than war . p. 145 AMYTIS ( In a whisper ) Hannibal ! You 're a great man . ( He takes an indecisive step toward her , as she stands before the column ; the impulse , however , is only momentary . He steps back . ) HANNIBAL Good-bye , gentlemen . I wish you luck with your conquest of the world . ( He goes out U.R. ) ( Bugle call . BALA comes in from U.L. , picks up HANIBAL 'S shield , and follows his master out . There is a shrill bugle call . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS What was all that he said about the " human equation " ? ( DRUSUS goes down the steps at the right , standing at the back , still visible , and gazing out after HANNIBAL . ) SCIPIO Hasdrubal was right . Hannibal has gone mad . ( He goes to the back to join DRUSUS . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS Let this be a lesson to doubters . Hannibal , with all his elephants , and all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome . AMYTIS Virtue is rewarded  --  is n't it , Fabius ? ( The African war drums start beating . The bugles come in , with a suggestion of wild , barbaric marching music. ) p. 146 FABIUS MAXIMUS Virtue , my dear , is the one perfect defense against all the evil forces on this earth . SCIPIO Look , Fabius  --  the army has started to move ! ( FABIUS goes to the back and looks off U.R . AMYTIS remains alone before the column . ) FABIUS MAXIMUS What a glorious sight ! SCIPIO There 's Hannibal  --  riding away . ( The terrifying sound of the drums and bugles swells in volume , the bugles seeming to shriek a final message of savage defiance to Rome . AMYTIS in front of large column . After the high note is played she drops her hands down . Curtain down . Drums and bugles play till curtain hits the floor. )                            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
