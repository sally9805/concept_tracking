In a bright green bathrobe with a golden harp between the shoulderblades , Jimmy McLarnin , lightweight , climbed into a roped square in Madison Square Garden . After one minute and forty-seven seconds of fighting he climbed out again onto the shoulders of yelling spectators . Alone in the ring with his handlers , a curly-headed Jew , Sidney Terris ( " Pride of the Ghetto " ) , came slowly back to consciousness , asked what had happened , and began to cry . A single short right to the jaw had finished him . McLarnin , boxing sensation of the season , is matched to fight loafing Lightweight-Champion Samuel Mandell in June .
