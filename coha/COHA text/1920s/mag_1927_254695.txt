Through the London Times came an appeal from Alexandros Philadelphus , onetime " director of the Acropolis and ephorus of the antiquities of Attica , " addressed to Great Britain . It read : " As you know , our grand national monument , the great temple of the Goddess Athena , the immortal Parthenon , was deprived more than a century ago of its ornaments , those superb sculptures which constitute the invaluable treasure in your great national museum . <P> " The usurper of those jewels , Lord Elgin , was not content with many masterpieces alone , but tore away and transported to England one of the six caryatids and one of the six columns of the eastern portico of the Erechtheum . " The writer bitterly asks the British Government to restore these two pieces , adding that he knows it would be useless to claim the heart of the collection . <P> History . In 1800 , the Earl of Elgin set forth to make drawings , models , paintings of the Athenian ruins which testify to the immortality of Periclean Greece and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominion . Being a Christian , Lord Elgin found himself obstructed at every turn . His artist companions were forbidden approach to the ruins , let alone entrance . Later Great Britain 's arms prevailed over France , and Egypt ( hitherto under French dominion ) was dealt to Turkey . So enthusiastic waxed the Ottomans over this token of good will , that Lord Elgin was told to go ahead and make all the drawings , paintings , investigations he liked and to take away with him any stones that appeared to be of interest to him . <P> Lord Elgin made the most of his good luck . Putting a broad interpretation upon his carte blanche , he proceeded to divest the Parthenon of its rarest ornaments-pediment , friezes , metopes , statuary . He proceeded as a private individual , without authority of parliament , with only private encouragement of public men . Hundreds of natives were employed in excavating , removing . The people of Greece showed no resentment . Indeed the interest attaching to the work brought tourists . The tourists , then as always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little use for Greek relics , other than as objects upon which to inflict spiteful blows when human victims were wanting . In 1816 , a select committee of the House of Commons reported to Parliament in favor of formal purchase of the " Elgin marbles " at a price of 36,000 . The proposal was accepted . Lord Elgin formally transferred the treasures , thus making Great Britain the grander for the glories of Greece . <P> The Marbles . Most of the art treasures were taken from the Parthenon . Scholars are inclined to believe them the work of Phidias . If not his , who else could have equaled his genius ? seems to be the usual conclusive argument . It is generally granted that Phidias had no equal in his time , that many of the pieces in question are of merit equal to the Apollo Belvidere , the Laocoon , the Torso of the Belvidere . <P> Foremost in the collection is the reclining Idaean Hercules . His body is graceful rather than Herculean , his face Attic rather than Theban . To him is attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wonder that the Athenians represented him as more lithe , less ponderous than the deity venerated by the despised Boeotians . He reposes on lion skins , suggestive of swift strength , leisurely superior to operose muscularity.
