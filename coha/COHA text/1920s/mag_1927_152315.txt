President Edward Henry Harriman Simmons of the New York Stock Exchange appeared on the rostrum for the second time in ten days to declare a member expelled . This time it was G. B. Todd , sole floor representative of the firm of Gordon B. Todd &; Co. , who had violated two rules : 1 ) pledging more securities of certain customers than was fair in view of the customer 's indebtedness to the firm ; 2 ) failing to answer that part of the questionnaire regularly submitted by the Exchange to its members in which explanation is demanded of how the firm guards against just this infraction . The broker is solvent . But his seat must be sold . <P> Said President Simmons : " The full power of the Exchange will be used at all times to punish evasion or suppression of any essential facts or data in answering the questionnaire . "
