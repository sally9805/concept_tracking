The purposes of a newspaper headline are : 1 ) to summarize , 2 ) to attract attention . Reputable papers stress summarizing . Sensational sheets seek attention . Both kinds , however , limit their headlines to facts within their stories . <P> As a rule . Not always . Now and then there will be a " possibility , " a fact suggested , but not contained , in a story , which the headline can imply or actually express yet not be lying . For example , last week The New York Telegram headlined : CANADA JURY ACQUITS FORD ON LIQUOR PIRACY CHARGE . <P> " Acquits Ford ? Henry Ford ? " exclaimed the reader . No , it was Captain Samuel Ford , the story explained . Henry Ford 's name was nowhere mentioned . Yet what more natural that one should think of him ? There had been no prominent series of stories on the case . What Fords other than Henry and Edsel are well known ? <P> A more obvious example of equivocal headlining appeared last week in The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editor of that daily : <P> " Not being interested in sports , I do not read that section of your paper . . . . Today , however , . . . a headline in your issue of September 9 caught my eye and held my incredulous attention . The headline was : CHRIST WINS GOLF TITLE . . . <P> " No doubt your caption writer considered his use of the winner 's name an amusing one . That the phrase should have been allowed to stand shows an unpardonable carelessness , at the least , in your editorial department . <P> " Revolting . . . sensational papers . . . grieved . . . screaming headlines . . . you guilty of such a breach of good taste . . . such irreverence . One looks to the Times for dignity , poise , restraint . "
