There were some labor-union leaders to be lunched and golfed with ; two bridges between Staten Island and New Jersey to open formally ; a clemency plea from two convicted murderers to consider . There was an inaccurate " shot " in a Prohibition film to denounce and have omitted . Then there was Mrs. Smith 's departure for Houston , the first time in a long time that Alfred Emanuel Smith had been separated from his wife for any great length of time . So Alfred Emanuel Smith had plenty to think about last week besides politics . <P> He denied one of the clemency pleas , granted the other pleader a reprieve . Accordingly , one Wilmot LeRoy Wagner was electrocuted at Sing Sing for killing two State Troopers who tried to arrest him in Caneadea , N. Y. , last summer ; and one Ludwig Halverson Lee , convicted of killing and dismembering two women , was told he might live until July 30 . <P> The Prohibition film matter was settled satisfactorily when the promoters of the film admitted their fault and agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a moral romance meant to advertise among Y. M. C. A. men the stirring statistics of Professor Irving Fisher , Yale economist and Dry propagandist . The script had called for a picture of Governor Smith signing a bill . The producer had clipped a newsreel " shot " of Governor Smith signing a tax-reduction bill and then implied by subtitles that the bill shown was the repealer to New York 's Prohibition enforcement act . <P> Saying goodbye to Mrs. Smith was momentous . She went from Manhattan on the private car of Contractor William Kenny , their old friend . Wife and friend expected him to be his party 's settled choice for President of the U. S. before they saw him again . Mrs. Emily Smith Warner , who was to have been an alternate delegate at Houston , stayed at home with her father . Illness was the immediate cause but doubtless he was glad in a way . The youngest Smith son , Walter , also stayed in Albany . <P> There were two politically significant interviews during the pre-convention Smith week : 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pledged its delegates , called on Candidate Smith in Manhattan the day after Governor Ritchie of Maryland withdrew his candidacy . Observers concluded that Candidate Pomerene had offered to withdraw too , if and when desired . <P> 2 ) A reporter from the militantly wet New York World called on Governor Smith and popped the following question : " In view of the question raised at Houston about Norman E. Mack 's statement see p. 9 , the World wishes to know : Have you changed your belief that there should be amendment of the present Prohibition provisions ? " <P> Governor Smith 's eyes narrowed and he said : " I have not ! " <P> Talk went about that , nominated for the Presidency , New York 's Governor would resign . New York 's Governor again denied this . <P> The most famed Smith learned that 10,000 persons named Smith were forming a Smith Association , planning a Smith picnic in St. Louis for mid-July . <P> A trainload of New York delegates paused at Albany . Governor Smith hand-shook on the platform . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominee , he grinned and said : " So you 're on your way , eh ? "
