txt Charles Hayden , chairman of the executive committee of the Cuba Cane Sugar Corp . baring returned from his annual tour of inspection of the prorcrties. states : " I have never seen the cane supply or our mills in better condition than today . Our organization is more coordinated at the different plantations that it has been in the past . " I am heartily in accord with President Machado 's decision to restrict the crop to 4,500,000 tons for this year . That does not mean that I am in favor of artificial restrictions in any product as a general thing . But when a person is seriously ill with pneumonia , doctors do not hesitate to give him oxygen ; that is artificial treatment . They do not continue giving him oxygen after he is well .
