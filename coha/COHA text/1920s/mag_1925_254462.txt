At Geneva , was held the 33rd meeting of the Council of the League of Nations , possibly the most significant deliberation of that body in the six years of the League 's history . <P> Protocol . The mightiest matter which was discussed was the Protocol* to the Covenant of the League . There were three principal speakers : <P> Chamberlain . Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain , sprucely attired , monocle firmly fixed in his right eye , rose to read a document wherein was written the voice of Great Britain and the British Dominions beyond the seas ( Canada , Australia , New Zealand , Union of South Africa ) . The voice passed sentence of death on the Protocol for the following reasons : <P> 1 ) Because it was likely to interfere with the inter se relations between the various component nations of the British Commonwealth . <P> 2 ) Because , without U. S. cooperation , the Protocol was seriously crippled . ( What Mr. Chamberlain doubtless meant was that- although a definite entente between the U. S. and Britain can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Dominions would today care to align itself against the U. S. The same might be said in a converse case , for it remains a fact that the foreign policies of the two countries , discounting inevitable differences of opinion , are to a large extent identical . Concrete expression of this premise is difficult , but it is notable that at no point is there a conflict of interest ; rather the reverse , for there has been a marked inclination to compose any differences which have arisen in the near past . <P> 3 ) Because economic sanctions against an aggressor nation would be useless while so many nations , U. S. , Germany , Russia , Turkey , etc. ) were nonLeague members , for the reason that the effect would be to divert the trade of an outlawed aggressor from the signatory to the non-signatory states of the Protocol . <P> 4 ) Because the use of force against an aggressor in cases where economic sanctions had failed is strangely out of place in the Protocol , which was designed primarily to promote peace . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ; and , just as it was a bad thing for men to think too much about the possibility of disease , so it was wrong for the Protocol to stress war . <P> Briand . After hearing Mr. Chamberlain 's speech , the Council adjourned for luncheon ; and M. Briand had three hours in which to prepare his reply and to obtain a confirmatory statement from his Government in Paris . When the Council reassembled , it was obvious that the impression made by Mr. Chamberlain 's well-reasoned reading of his Government 's document was gloomy ; as M. Briand subsequently put it : " I had the impression of being in blackness , in a tunnel where there was no light . " Rising , however , in a later session , M. Priand , seven times Premier of France , vigorously assailed the British Government 's contentions . He started : <P> ' ' The document read to us is marked by a high serenity and gentle philosophy which I hesitate to affront . I have tasted this philosophy and appreciated its nobility and I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
