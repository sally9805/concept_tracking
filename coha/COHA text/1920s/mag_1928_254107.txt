" Lift up your heads , O ye gates , and be ye lifted up , ye everlasting doors ! " <P> These words were addressed by Dr. John Grier Hibben , president of Princeton University , in a loud voice , to a pair of oak doors . He knocked loudly on the doors three times and a squeaky little voice was heard coming from the inside . Soon the doors opened and a face , under a little red cap , thrust itself between them . This was the face of famed Architect Ralph Adams Cram . The doors were those of the new , huge , Gothic Chapel designed by Architect Cram and built at a cost of $2,000,000 , for Princeton students to worship in . The chapel , larger than all other college chapels except that at King 's College , * Cambridge , was being dedicated last week with properly pretentious medieval ceremony when the knocking and opening occurred . After the dedication , the Bach Choir of Bethlehem , Pa. , sang Bach 's " Mass in B Minor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Princeton 's friends had raised $200,000 to pay for a man to go with it . The friends in this case were the mem bers of the family of twin brothers , now dead , who were graduated from Princeton in 1877 , Judge Walter Lloyd-Smith and the Rev. Wilton Merle-Smith . The man was Dr. Robert Russell Wicks , intelligent , eloquent Congregationalist lately of Holyoke , Mass . For him the new office of Dean of the Chapel was created . Hitherto Princeton , traditionally Presbyterian , has had no official pastor . <P> <P> - Called " most beautiful building in England . "
