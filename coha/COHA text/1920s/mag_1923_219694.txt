The American bill against the Germans for damages caused in the war amounting to $1,200,000,000 was held in Paris as proof that the French bill for reparations is in no way excessive . The Government is said to be willing to accept $6,500,000,000 for the expense of reconstructing the devastated areas . It is pointed out that the United States bill is about 20% of the amount asked by France , and that by no stretch of imagination could the Government of the United States contend that they had sustained one-fifth of the damage done to France during the war .
