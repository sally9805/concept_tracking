Traditionally inseparable are salt and pepper. * All laymen recognize their union , their happy partnership . Few laymen realize their fundamental differences . Salt is a mineral ; pepper a vegetable . Salt is a domestic product ; all black pepper is imported . <P> Last week , specialists in the salt and pepper markets noted a more acute , immediate difference . The price of salt goes steadily down . ( TIME , Sept. 17 . ) But the price of pepper is soaring , rocketlike , to record heights . <P> Pepper , a seed , is picked from a 40-foot vine , growing up the trunk of a tree , or around a low hut . There are two seasons , two sources . From Telok Belong in Dutch East India are harvested each July between 10.000 and 24,000 tons of pepper seeds known as Lampong . Alleppy and Tellicherry pepper comes from India and is harvested in December . Before they are used for seasoning , the seeds are ground , packed in tin boxes , and given a label . But whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought in an exclusive delicatessen shop or in the Great Atlantic &; Pacific tea store , no matter what the box or price , all pepper tastes alike . <P> The 1927 crop of Lampong was far below normal . This year 's crop , not yet delivered , is only about 15,000 tons . Spice traders ( pepper is the most important of their 108 spices ) , trading in spot pepper and futures , are short when the time of delivery arrives . They must get pepper at any price to fulfill contracts . They must draw from the surplus Alleppy and Tellicherry in India and in England , and pay dearly . Prices rise . From a normal price of 12-a pound , pepper quotations have risen to 43 . Brokers prophesied last week that a high of 40 would be touched before the December crop of Alleppy and Tellicherry is shipped in February or March . <P> <P> * Other inseparables : vinegar and oil , Damon and Pythias , warp and woof , odds and ends , pen and ink , man and wife , flotsam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might and main , sixes and sevens , beer and skittles , bread and butter , jot and tittle , flora and fauna , sweetness and light .
