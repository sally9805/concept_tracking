( See front cover ) <P> PEOPLE-Edgar Wallace-Doubleday , Doran ( $2 ) . <P> The Man . " I 'm sorry , sir , " says the butler over the telephone , " Mr. Wallace is writing a play and must not be disturbed before it 's finished . . . . What 's that , sir ? . . . You 'll hold the wire ? " <P> Author Edgar Wallace 's reputation for speed , no comic myth , follows logically enough upon prolific production . Last year he had six successes on the London stage , and in New York The Sign of the Leopard . In the spring , when only four of his plays were running simultaneously , he gave a banquet at the Savoy for his theatrical employes , and his guests numbered 590 . Not content with writing the plays and entertaining the players , he has latterly become his own producer and designer of scenes-all this being a development of the last three years . Readers of the morning papers are more accustomed to him as dramatic critic ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for invaluable tips . <P> But the great mass of his public cherishes him for quite another reason : dean of mystery and detective fiction , he has written 400-odd short stories , and , at the last census , 140 full-length yarns . One in every four books sold in England is by Wallace , and the tremendous sale in Germany , the U. S. , Australia and South Africa , brings his yearly total to 5,000,000 copies . His U. S. publishers are boasting " a Wallace per month " for the next twelve months , and his German Verlag distributes a catalog two-thirds of which concerns Wallace Detektiv-Romane and Theaterstcken . <P> Small wonder that Author Wallace , indefatigable , portly and debonair , lives a crowded schedule . He begins the day at 7 o'clock by consuming eight newspapers , dictates mysteries until 10 a.m. , breakfasts , resumes writing until 1 . In the afternoons he supervises his play rehearsals , inspects cinema versions of his stories , or attends the races . He owns a string of horses and squanders a literarily fabulous income . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a kind of an " * autobiography , lavish with anecdotes of " people , " ranging from his fishmonger foster-father to William Jennings Bryan , his son 's godfather . Written objectively , the effect is as though he were telling of somebody else . Written carelessly in helter-skelter , unkempt style , People might well have been tossed into a dictaphone between tea and dinner . <P> His Story . Escaped from board school , with three Shakespeare plays as the sum of his knowledge , Edgar Wallace drifted from newsboy to sea-cook and back again . He worked for a milkman , a florist , a printer , a mason ; turned up in the Army while still in his ' teens . In South Africa he resigned from the military in favor of newspaper work , and during the Boer War coded many a scoop to his London paper , much to Kitchener 's embarrassment and the censor 's discomfiture . The war over , Wallace was appointed editor of the Transvaal 's largest newspaper , and on the proceeds he played with notorious bulls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , lost $20,000 the next , and landed back in London with exactly three shillings in his pocket .
