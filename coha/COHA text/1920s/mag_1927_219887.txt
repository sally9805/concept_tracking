On the white pages of World 's Work ( monthly ) word followed word with seemingly unimpeachable logic . Mark Sullivan , dean of Washington correspondents , wrote as he had written many times before . Genially , understandably , he eulogized the six-year record of keen-minded Andrew Mellon as Secretary of the Treasury , explained how he had reduced the national debt between Aug. 31 , 1919 , and Dec. 31 , 1926 , from 26.6 billion dollars to 19.1 billions . <P> In his study , Fabian Franklin , economist and likewise journalist , Mr. Sullivan 's senior by 22 years , scanned the article . He was accustomed to spying an error a day in the press . He was accustomed to let them pass in silence . But these errors by famed Mr. Sullivan were too flagrant to endure . To the New York Times he wrote hotly : " We note an astonishing error in the mere statement of bald facts . President Wilson 's term did not end until March 4 , 1921 . " <P> How then can Mr. Mellon ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion , 600 million dollar reduction in the debt before that time ? " . . . The blunder is almost incredible on the part of a newspaperman , to whom Presidential year dates are naturally the most familiar of all possible landmarks . . . the article throughout is vitiated by ... error . " <P> How , asked Mr. Franklin , can Secretary Mellon be honestly called debt-reduction-wonderman in face of the facts that " in the months from Aug. 31 , 1919 , to Dec. 31 , 1920 , the debt was reduced by 2.6 billions under Mr. Mellon 's predecessors ; and that the best Mr. Mellon was able to do was to reduce it by 2.1 billions in the three years from Dec. 31 , 1920 , to Dec. 31 , 1923 , and by 2.8 billions in the three years from Dec. 31 , 1923 , to Dec. 31 , 1926 ? " <P> All of which made unhappy those newspapermen who revere Mr. Sullivan . They could say it was remarkable that a man who writes so much is so seldom wrong . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is becoming more of a partisan , less of a newspaperman.
