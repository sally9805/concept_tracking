" The Bishop of Rome can not in fact fail to deplore the fact that here in the Holy City of Catholicism , after 20 centuries of Christianity the sensitiveness and attention to delicate care due to young women and girls should be shown to have fallen lower than Pagan Rome . . . . " <P> These were the mournful words which Pope Pius XI wrote in an open letter to Cardinal Pompili , vicar of the Rome diocese , apropos of a " gymnastic " competition which was held in that city last week . The Pontiff proceeded to explain that he was not , in principle , opposed to athletics but that when competitions became too exhibitionistic , he felt compelled to frown . Governmental circles in Rome regarded the Pope 's letter as another manifestation of the Vatican 's opposition to what the Pope calls " Fascist monopolization of the education of youth . " At the end of his document the Pontiff gave a hint as to how his own theories contrasted with Fascist practices . It was a calm and holy hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve and modesty which are the ornament and safeguard of virtue . Such instruction must contain no incentive to vanity or violence . If a woman 's hand must be raised , we hope and pray it may be raised only in prayer or in acts of charity . "
