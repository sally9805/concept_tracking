Before the Red Tribunal in the magnificent Hall of Nobles at Moscow appeared Ivan Okladsky , aged 65 , to answer for a crime committed 43 years ago . He was charged with being the world 's greatest traitor , a man who had lived on the blood of revolutionary martyrs . Thousands of people flocked to hear the life history of Okladsky . <P> Ivan Okladsky became a revolutionary in his earliest days . He joined the Narodnaia Volia or Party of the People 's Will-members of this party are better known as the Nihilists-which was led by Prince Peter Kropotkin , Catherine Breshkovsky , Nicholas Tchaikovsky . <P> This little stout man with long grey whiskers told how he , a boy of 16 , had tried to kill Tsar Alexander II* in 1875 by mining the Winter Palace at St. Petersburg ( now Leningrad ) . He told how he mined the railway track in 1879 along the route to be taken by the Tsar on his return to the capital from the Crimea . He told how , in 1880 , he had mined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tsar . He told why he was always unsuccessful . <P> In 1881 , Alexander was most foully murdered . At this time , Okladsky was in prison and shortly after the assassination he was brought up for trial . To his Tsarist judges he said : " I do not ask and I do not need your leniency . On the contrary , if you show me mercy , I shall regard this as a personal insult . " He was sentenced to death , but the sentence was almost immediately commuted <P> About a year later , Okladsky was the highest paid ordinary official of the notorious Okrana or Tsarist secret police . He was created a " personal noble " ( noble for life ) , later an hereditary nobleman. * In Moscow , before his Bolshevik judges , he said that he had been forced to betray his Nihilist comrades under the inhuman torture to which he was subjected while awaiting execution and , at the price of his freedom , had consented to join the Okrana and work for the Tsar . <P> The grim figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prisoner . This demand was quickly granted , but , out of consideration for the advanced age of the " revolutionary traitor " the death sentence was commuted to ten years ' penal servitude . <P> * On Mar. 13 , 1881 , Tsar Alexander II . was driving along the bank of the St. Michael Canal wren a young man threw what appeared to be a snowball at the Imperial sledge . The snowball went off with a thundering detonation , the carriage was shattered , two men of the Tsar 's escort were killed outright , many were wounded ; but Alexander escaped scot-free . <P> His Imperial Majesty was then implored by faithful servants to return hastily to the Winter Palace , but he insisted upon remaining to look after the victims . Somewhere an agitated voice called out : " Are you hurt , Your Majesty ? " " No , thank God , " replied the Tsar . At this the assassin , who had been seized , grimly remarked that it was a little early to thank God . As he spoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the feet of the Tsar . . . .
