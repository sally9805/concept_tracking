T HE latest chapter in the history of the great American habit of doing business on credit has been written in Boston . The chapter is not yet completed , though it has been more than a year in the writing . But when it shall have been completed , an effect almost as tremendous may be produced as that which followed the celebrated panic of 1907 when " somebody asked for a dollar . " The result of that panic , and its accompanying discovery that if everybody 's loans were to be called at one time there would not be enough currency to go round , was the establishment of the Federal Reserve Bank . That new device did not exactly curtail credit ; it sublimated it . Men continued to borrow money on which to do business . Sometimes they could not pay their obligations when they became due . Here and there cases developed where the borrowers could not get their notes renewed or extended . Such a business was called " sick . " In many instances , the lending individual or banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it , and sold it or carried it along . Very few indeed have been the instances in which a business , cured of its sickness , remained in the hands of its original owner . This " taking over the business " by banks has been common enough . Until recently , there seemed to be nothing to prevent it . However , a few years ago a laW was passed by Congress which was aimed at the labor organizations ; it forbade combinations to prevent employers from hiring whom they wished to hire , regardless of union affiliations or lack of them . Still later , the Supreme Court ruled that this law would apply to capital also . In other words , as the plaintiffs in the case which has just been tried in Boston claim , it is still possible for any financier to demand exorbitant terms for the use of his money . But if several financiers combine , having found a business in need of financing , to compel the owner of that business in return for money loaned to turn over his business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will lie . Something like this process of " curing a sick business " was gone through in Boston in 1918 and 1919 , with the same old result . When it was all over , the former owner complained bitterly that he had been robbed of a perfectly sound and profitable business . He took his complaint first to Charles E. Hughes , who was an eminent lawyer before he was Secretary of State . At the time Mr. Hughes was just starting for Europe and could not undertake the case . He advised that Sherman L. Whipple of Boston be retained . This was done . Suit was entered , and after the long and formal processes of law , came to trial in Dedham , Norfolk County , Massachusetts , on November 6 , 1923 . Interrupted once by the illness of the presiding judge , Christopher T. Callahan of Holyoke , the case has dragged through a weary year . For most of the time , court has sat four days a week ; the case was finally given to the jury at noon on Monday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The jurors were kept together from that time until a verdict was reported . This came at the opening of court on December 18 ? the 187th day  --  when the jurors sent word that they had agreed upon a verdict . When it was opened , it was found that they P. SIBLEY had given the plaintiff practically all he asked for ; the damages , based on the value of the two companies as taken away on March 24 , 1919 , with interest to date , minus the $500,000 the defendants paid on July 31 , 1918 , and the $125,000 paid on March 24 , 1919 , were set at $10,534,109.07 . It is interesting to note that during the trial one of the jurors was stricken by mental trouble , and that the case went on with eleven jurors  --  an unusual though not unique procedure . The plaintiff was George F. Willett , who sued for $15 , - 000,000 damages for the loss of the American Felt Company and the Daniel Green Felt Shoe Company by an alleged conspiracy . The defendants were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the real founder and former president of the Harvard Club , who has been closely associated with banking interests in Boston . Other defendants were Daniel G. Wing , president of the First National Bank ; Sewall H. Fessenden of the note-brokers ' firm of F. S. Moseley &; Company , and that firm ; Robert Winsor of the great banking house of Kidder , Peabody &; Company , and that firm , and the Chase National Bank of New York . Willett was formerly a member of the firm of Willett , Sears &; Company , and sued as the surviving partner of that firm , the partnership having been dissolved in 1920 with an agreement that Willett should assume all the liabilities and assets . Willett  --  is an unusual man . One of his friends says " he is not interested in a company that is going along smoothly . He can see nothing but the development of industrial units ; he is not interested in profits . Once he has acquired a company and fitted it into place in an industrial combination , he is interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as a danger to the financial world . Willett was first in a bank , then in the wool business , next in the leather business , and finally in the felt manufacturing business . He acquired the American Felt Company , which at that time owned the Daniel Green Felt Shoe Company , in 1911 . When a certain dividend of the American Felt Company was paid to Willett , Sears &; Company by a check , this check was turned back to the company in exchange for its shares in the Daniel Green Felt Shoe Company . Then the expansion began . By 1918 Willett , Sears &; Company owned these two companies , and controlling interests in the stocks of some sixteen other companies . They included the Roxbury Carpet Company and its subsidiary , the Boston Belting Corporation ; the Boston Piano Supply Company , the Luxemoor Company , Doremus &; Company , and the Importers ' Company . The last two were organized as selling and purchasing agencies for the Willett-Sears combination . Besides these , there were companies comprising what Willett called the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Press Company , the United Printing Machinery Company , the Framingham foundries , and the Ames Plow Company . Housing associations in Norwood , Franklin , and Framingham ; a Norwood Construction Company and a Norwood Plumbing and Heating Company were real-estate propositions intended primarily to serve the interests of the employees in these towns , where the Willett-Sears plants were located . Finally  --  to the great confusion of inter-company accounts in the end  --  there was the Industrial Service and Equipment Company , intended to do the accounting , the laboratory and efficiency work , for all the Willett-Sears companies .. The story of what happened in 1918 , so far as both sides agree to the facts , started in May . Willett 's companies had millions of dollars ' worth of notes outstanding and they had come suddenly up against the war conditions . There was a great rush of business , and simultaneously an immense increase in the cost of material and labor . Financing was needed to carry the two principal companies over the turn of the year . The defendants say that this first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks of deposit in Boston , in June of 1918 . The plaintiffs say that it was started by a delayed annual statement of the American Felt Company , which was sent out by the accountants on May 22 , as of December 31 , 1917 . They say that the statement was unfavorable enough to cause the vice-president of the First National Bank to tell Mr. Sears , the financial member of the firm of Willett , Sears &; Company , that the bank could not " check " their paper on that statement . Mr. Sears protested that the first three months of 1918 made a far better showing , and that if the figures were brought down to date they would show a condition that would enable the bank to check the paper . Unfortunately , however , the note brokers usually employed by Willett , Sears &; Company ( F. S. Moseley &; Company ) were already having difficulty to sell their notes . Then , the plaintiffs say , they requested Mr. Fessenden of that firm to set about arranging a special loan , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The defendants say that Mr. Willett first went to the Old Colony Trust Company , notified its president , Philip Stockton , that he wanted to use his full line of credit and that he wished also an extension of that credit by $100,000 . From that bank he went to the National Shawmut , - and told its president , Alfred L. Aiken , the same thing , adding that Mr. Stockton had " agreed to his request . Mr. Aiken testified that he demurred to an extension except under conditions . Later in the same day Mr. Aiken was in communication with Mr. Stockton , who said there had been a misunderstanding ; he had not promised Willett any new loan of $100,000 . Almost at the same time Mr. Aiken heard from C. H. Dwinnell , vice-president of the First National Bank , that Mr. Willett had been there also . It seemed to the bank presidents that it was high time to call a meeting of the banks who had dealings with Willett , Sears &; Company and to consider the status of that firm . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get some more information , and called another meeting an June 18 , at which Mr. Fessenden was asked to be present and to tell how much commercial paper Willett , Sears &; Company and their companies had out . Mr. Wellington of the accountants ' firm was also asked to be present to tell of the condition of the companies . In the version of the plaintiffs , these meetings were called by Mr. Fessenden for the purpose of arranging a special loan with a syndicate of banks . A third meeting was called for June 24 , and at this there were present representatives of the Old Colony Trust Company , the First National Bank , the National Shawmut , the Merchants ' National , and the Webster and Atlas Na tional . Mr. Sears was called in , and an effort was made to determine how much would be needed to finance the two felt companies across the turn of the year . The bankers knew all about the subsidiary companies in the Willett-Sears combination . They had not a very high opinion of them ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shoe Company , they testified , as " worth saving , " but from the beginning of the negotiations refused to lend any money to carry on the other companies . It was determined that $3,000,000 ? or in the careful bankers ' phrase , " not more than $3,000,000 " ? would suffice . Willett and Sears protested that they did not need any such amount , but they testified that Mr. Fessenden told them they would better take what was offered and not be obliged to come around a second time for more help . There was another meeting on June 27 . By this time the bargain was taking shape ; the bankers offered a loan for six months , and demanded 6 per cent interest on the amount of money that might be drawn under the special loan . Six per cent on the whole $3,000,000 was to be paid " for the commitment " ? that is to say , as a commission or bonus . This , as Mr. Whipple pointed out , amounted to an interest charge of 18 per cent . Furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felt Company and the Daniel Green Felt Shoe Company should be turned to a committee of their appointing , to serve for the life of the loan . Mr. Fessenden drew a memorandum of this agreement . Daniel G. Wing , president of the First National Bank , suggested to his vice-president , Mr. Dwinnell , that the First National 's interest in the Willett-Sears affair be turned over to C. F. Weed , another vice-president , and Mr. Weed began to get up a draft of a formal agreement for the loan . He suggested , however , that the bank ought to retain counsel , and suggested that his brother , Arthur H. Weed , was in Robert F. Herrick 's office , and might get Mr. Herrick to take the case . Mr. Herrick was general counsel for the bank and an intimate associate of Mr. Wing . Mr. Herrick agreed to come in on condition that Arthur H. Weed do the actual work , and that he advise from time to time . He was engaged also by the Old Colony Trust Company as counsel . Willett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were merely hearing from time to time through their financial agent , Mr. Fessenden , of the progress of the loan . Meanwhile , the time was going on , and the loan was not being made . Time was an important element to Willett and Sears ; they had a note for $200,000 coming due in the Chase National Bank on July 15 . After the bankers ' meeting on June 27 , this Chase Bank note assumed more importance . It was one of two notes , each for $200,000 , and they were notes of Willett and Sears , not of the felt companies ; the second note fell due on October 15 . And they were secured by 12,000 shares of American Felt common . Still another note , for $100,000 , secured by 2,000 shares , lay in the Girard National Bank of Philadelphia . Unless Willett and Sears could somehow secure this stock which was up as collateral they could not comply with the condition imposed by the Boston bankers , that they should turn over the stock control of the American - F- elt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of the bankers was held on July 5 , and this matter was discussed . At the end of the meeting a telegram was sent to E. V. R. Thayer , president of the Chase Bank , asking him to extend the notes and to deposit the stock with the Boston men . Mr. Fessenden sent the telegram . On July 8 Mr. Thayer came to Boston to a meeting of the bankers . They made the same request of him , and he refused to part with his collateral . He told them they could trust him just as well as he could trust them . But , he said , he wanted to help in the situation , and offered to have his bank participate in the loan , and to take as large a share as anybody . He asked Mr. Fessenden to write him a memorandum of what had occurred and departed . Mr. Fessenden did write that same day , stating the terms of the loan . Willett , Sears &; Company were to convert $500,000 of non-liquid assets in the American Felt treasury into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lend the American Felt Company and the Daniel Green Felt Shoe Company not in excess of $3,000,000 until February 15 , 1919 , and this loan was to be a preferred debt . Not a word was said in the letter about the stock held by the Chase Bank . Mr. Thayer answered on the following day , agreeing to the terms and saying his bank would take $440,000 of the loan . The plaintiffs claimed that these two letters constituted an agreement to make the loan , with the stock remaining in Thayer 's hands . The defendants say that the meeting of July 8 resulted in a deadlock , and Willett and Sears were still obliged to raise $500,000 and to redeem the stock and bring it to Boston . In any event , Willett and Sears knew nothing of the facts , and went to everybody they knew , trying to raise the $500,000 . They were unsuccessful until Mr. Fessenden suggested that they go to Robert Winsor of Kidder , Peabody &; Company . The bankers had already insisted that Moseley &; Company ought to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put out so much of the American Felt commercial paper . Mr. Fessenden had agreed to take $440,000 , and had persuaded Mr. Winsor to put Kidder , Peabody &; Company in for a similar amount , as the banking house had sold the preferred stock issue of the felt company . Willett and Sears called on Mr. Winsor , and Willett put the matter before him . " If you will raise this money for us , " said Mr. Willett , " you can have anything you want . " Mr. Winsor agreed to form a syndicate and raise the money ; his commission for doing so was to be 5,000 shares of the stock , with the proviso that Willett and Sears might buy it back for $500,000 . This loan was to be for two years at 6 per cent interest . The interview with Winsor was on July 18 , three days after the first note in the Chase Bank had become due and had gone to protest . On July 24 Mr. Winsor told Willett and Sears that the terms of the loan would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase instead of a loan ; he would buy their stock-16,500 shares of American Felt and 500 shares of Daniel Green  --  for $500,000 , and give them an option to repurchase it at any time within two years . But also , he had taken in another man in the syndicate , and another share must be added to the repayment price . So the repurchase would cost them $1,227,000 ; it was made up of the original $500,000 , a bonus of $500,000 , the added share of $167,000 , and $60,000 interest . With a note already gone to protest and a $3,000,000 loan hanging on the issue , Willett and Sears agreed to this bargain . Papers were passed on July 31 . The $500,000 syndicate consisted of Kidder , Peabody &; Company , F. S. Moseley &; Company , the Chase Bank and the Girard Bank , and Robert F. Herrick . The $3,000,000 loan was made , and thecompanies began to draw money against it . The full amount was never used ; the Daniel Green paid up its share as due , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months so that renewal of the remainder was easy . The bankers appointed Messrs . Fessenden , Herrick , and Winsor managers of the subsidiary companies , and they set about liquidating them . Willett and Sears resigned all the offices they held in all their companies and began working on " plans of reorganization . " Willett had bought , or contracted to buy , the stock of the Plymouth Rubber Company . In his situation in the fall of 1918 he was unable to carry out this contract , and suit was brought in November by Mr. Sydemann , the owner of that company , to compel the fulfilment of the contract . Sydemann put attachments on all Willett 's property . By this time bankruptcy for Willett , Sears &; Company was more than a possibility . In December Mr. Herrick bought up from several banks in Boston notes of some of Willett 's companies , indorsed by Willett and Sears or by Willett . After the first of the year he caused suit to be brought on these notes , not against the makers but against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the firm and the individuals . There now seemed to be no way out for Willett and Sears except through the door of bankruptcy . They appointed assignees to settle with their creditors , and this was done in March , the $500,000 syndicate paying $125,000 more for all the remaining stock Willett and Sears had in the American Felt Company and the Daniel Green Felt Shoe Company , and the option to repurchase . The plaintiffs pointed out during the trial that this $125,000 was precisely the sum that was taken out of the treasuries of the subsidiary companies that were being liquidated , for " expenses . " Willett and Sears settled with their creditors , and the companies belonged to the syndicate . The transaction was complete . It was by no means unique , and the defendants have said frankly that their purpose from the beginning was to eliminate Willett , who was considered a dangerous man because of his reckless schemes of expansion . The verdict produced intense excitement in Boston , where the defendants are some of the best-known men of the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thousands in the streets . The jury had believed that there was some thread of connection through the jumble of apparently isolated events , and that the things which happened did not happen of themselves . The effect of the verdict , if it be sustained by the Supreme Court a year or two hence , is almost incalculable . If financiers are not to be allowed to protect their loans by ample margins of profit to protect their risks ; if they are not to be allowed to foreclose on collateral ; if they are not to be allowed to decide whether to loan or not , credit is going to be much more difficult to secure in this country . On the other hand , if business men are not entitled to credit upon a showing of their financial condition , business will have to be done at a much slower rate . One question that seems to be involved is whether national banks can refuse credit on their own judgment ; another is whether any man with the ability to trade and to make book accounts appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on buying one company after another , and indefinitely to spread out until a check in his income must bring down the whole structure of credit-supported business .
