President Coolidge celebrated the close of his fifth year in office with a short railroad trip . It is only about a three-hour journey from Cedar Island lodge to a place called Hibbing in the Minnesota hinterland . Thither the President journeyed in a special train provided by U. S. Steel Corp. , a train that had been examined and guarded with utmost care for 48 hours before its great passenger went aboard . Steel Corporation guards were posted at switches and trestles . Some 700 American Legion men were mobilized for guard duty at stations . No spectator was allowed to approach within 300 yards of the train when it stopped . Dozens of persons suspected of discontent about Labor 's condition were temporarily deported from the region . Everything was prearranged so carefully that almost nothing happened to remember the event by . Yet it was an historic event . <P> It was Calvin Coolidge , apostle of Prosperity , visiting perhaps the greatest single source of Prosperity in the U. S. The low mountains of Itasca and St. Louis counties are , literally , mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enormous red yawn , is the Hull-Rust Mine , the largest open-pit iron ore mine in the world . <P> Thirty-six years ago , when Calvin Coolidge was a countrified freshman at Amherst , a train of cars creaked down from the Mesaba Range , where Hibbing was to be built , bearing the first shipment of blood-colored rocks and dust. * Today the Mesaba district produces 63 million tons of iron ore per annum , four-fifths the total consumption of the U. S. In 1892 , the iron ranges of Wisconsin and the Michigan peninsula-Gogebic , Florence , Menominee-had been developed for over a decade . They were the first answer to Railroader James J. Hill 's gloomy prediction that the world 's supply of iron was approaching exhaustion . By 1902 , the Minnesota deposits , almost unlimited , were yielding more than the mines , were outranking the Michigan and Wisconsin ranges . The Minnesota ore lay right at the earth 's surface , or buried only a few feet . The iron-bearing substance was earthy , not rocky . All that men had to do was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> On the train with President Coolidge rode Pentecost Mitchell of Duluth , whose father organized the first mining company on the Mesaba . Mr. Mitchell , president of U. S. Steel Corp . ' s potent subsidiary , Oliver Iron Mining Co. , doubtless referred to the fact that a rich part of the Mesaba used to belong to the Federal-Government , before iron was discovered there . It was traded to the State of Minnesota and now is operated by U. S. Steel Corp . on a royalty basis . Township taxes on the mining properties have made Hibbing one of the richest communities in the land . The miners who live there pay a nominal price for the heat that is piped to their shacks and frame houses from a municipal heating plant . Their children go to high school in a $4,500,000 edifice.
