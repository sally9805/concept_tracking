The finest motor car smashups in all the World happen at little crossroads in rural France . For one thing there are no speed laws and barely any traffic . Why then drop below 100 kilometers per hour ( 62 m. p. h. ) , just because the perfect road down which one is whizzing must soon cross another ? Sacre bleu ! If one is a French chauffeur , and if one has waited in the sun all morning at the wheel of a Bugatti or a Farman* then what joy , what exhilaration , when one 's fat Spanish employer and a couple of his " little girls " scramble into the tonneau , crying , " En route Henri ! Nous sommes pour Biarritz ! " <P> Elements precisely such as these produced a magnificent whizz-smash , last week , when Don Alfonso Cocobo , a Grandee of Spain , set out for Biarritz and ended up in a de luxe private suite at the Hospital of Bayonne . <P> On the same afternoon a similar whizz-smash befell H. H. Prince Ibrahim of Egypt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but bruises raised big spots of black &; blue . Tout Paris was inclined to mock at Ibrahim , - at Cocobo , - even at " little girls " all ruefully bruised and tender . Ere nightfall , however , Tout Paris caught breath over a third accident . <P> Whizz ! Whirr ! With humming tires and throbbing motor there sped down a deserted road near Epernay the great Marshal Ptain-who once held Verdun against Germany 's Crown Prince . <P> Not a French chauffeur could be found who would knowingly refuse right of way to the Marshal of France Henri Philippe Benoni Omer Joseph Ptain . <P> However , in the gloaming , two whizzing cars can approach very near a crossroad without becoming aware of each other . Fortunately the Marshal 's chauffeur is a talented swerver . He broke the force of the whizz-smash by a cool , adroit skid-swerve . When the man at the wheel turned around with blanched face to explain , he received from Marshal Ptain a little nod and a typical , paternal phrase of encouragement , " Bien fait , mon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
