txt Senator Borah of Idaho told the Protestant Ministers ' Association here today that enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment was the only way to take prohibition out of politics . Attempts to repeal the dry law , he declared , were in reality attacks upon the Constitu ' tion , which meant nullification , and Ithis , he asserted , was the greatest I present danger to the Republic . I The First Presbyterian Church , in which the Idaho Senator spoke , was jammed to capacity , and a large crowd outside the building listened to the speech by the aid of amplifiers . It was in this church- that Woodrow Wilson 's father preached , and Mr. Borah spoke from the same pulpit . Asserting that if neither of the present parties would take a positive stand on the prohibition issue , " the people should . organize another party which will be loyal to the Constitution of the United States , " Mr. Borah declared that the wet referendums proposed in several States , and especially the plan - imposed in New York , were wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to express themselves in favor of amending the Constitution , he said , but " in ' favor of the States respectively ' ' ' C8 ' construing and efiAoreL.g e nstitution of the United States . " Defines the Liquor Issue . In his address to the clergymen Sen ator Borah said : When the debate on the liquor problem opened a few months ago , the question did not seem particularly important . It did . not appear to be either interesting or significant . The discussion was- over the modification of the Volstead act , a little higher percentage of alcohol , ' but always within . the Constitution , and therefore always non-intoxicating . The controversy had not proceeded far , however , until the most =portant issue that a self-governing people can ever be called upon to consider forged its way to the front . Instead of a modification of the Volstead act , we now have the nullification of the Constitution , Instead of non-intoxicating liquor within the Constitution , the demand is now for intoxicating liquor in defiance of the Constitution . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by the Constitution , to amend the Constitution , appeal is made to the principle of " direct action . " Instead of amending the Constitution so as to turn this matter back to the States , if it is thought wise to do so , it is seriously proposed that the States shall be given control , regardless of the Constitution  --  the Federal Government , like Saul of old , consenting to the crime . The same leaders who asked in the beginning for Modification within the Constitution now declare that they will have intoxicating liquor , Constitution or no Constitution , Volstead act or no Volstead act . This is the issue that we now have to meet . It may be that it is within the power of the liquor interests to amend the Constitution  --  a thing which it is well within their rights to undertake and within possibilities to achieve . But I take the privlege of asserting , and without fear of the future , that it is not within the power of the liquor interests to nullify the Constitution . Hoids Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered that the Constitution of the United States is not unalterable . It is to continue in its present form no longer than the people who established it shall choose to continueit . If they shall become convinced that they have made an injudicious or inexpedient partition and dis- tribution of power between the State Governments and the General Government , , they can alter that distribution at will . " If the Eighteenth Amendment was an injudicious distribution of power between the State and National Governments , then the people can take it out of the Constitution in the same way and by . the same process they wrote it into the Constitution . If it was a. mistake , the people can be shown that it was a. mistake , and . they are wise enough and brave enough to take it out . If , on the other hand , after reconsideration and further reflection , the people conclude it was not a mistake . then under proper and sincere leadership the people will live up to it and maintain it . There is no possible excuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no law which may not be repealed . There is no provision of the Constitution ' which may not be rewritten or wholly expunged . To preach nullification is to preach lawlessness  --  disregard fqr law , that ancient and persistent enemy of all republics . It is to apply a principle which , like poison in the human system , will search its way into every vein and artery of the body politic . What are the arguments now advanced against following the orderly procedure of amending the Constitution ? They are familiar arguments . They are the practices which are making a hell . of Europe today . They are denying free speech , free press , liberty , individuality and justice to countless millions . They are tracing every day 's routine of life in blood . The first argument is that it will take too long , that the method is tedious and cumbersome  --  that is the cardinal tenet of Fascism . It is said the Eighteenth Amendment is against conscience , oppressive ? therefore disregard it . This is the precise argument which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Talks of Mob Rule . We are told that the people are fanatics or wanting in judgment , and that they may not repeal the Eighteenth Amendment  --  that is the basis of military rule in Poland . Mob rule is mob rule , whether it is the mob of the street or the mob of the professional club , whether it is preached from a dry goods box or in a university chapel . Lynch law Is lynch law , whether you are lynching an individual or the Constitution . Of course , the people will have to be consulted , but I have heard that this is a Government of the people , by the people , and for the people . Certainly the forms prescribed by the Constitution will have to be observed , for this is a Government of law and not of men . It may take some time to accomplish all this . But it will take far less time to amend the Constitution in the manner pointed out by the Constitution than it will take to convince the American people that nullification is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great and orderly people will never accept any such doctrine . It would be a monstrous thing . It would be national self-abasement before all the world . An abased and contented people the American people can never be . We belong to a different breed of men . I venture to say there could be no greater exhibition of self-abasement , of national degradation , than for this great people to leave the Eighteenth Amendment in the Conatitution and , as some have said , forget it and go ahead and live in daily disregard of it . It presents an outlook of national weakness which language is inadequate to describe . If the adversaries of the Eighteenth Amendment , now greatly interested for the first time in the principle of referendums , would submit a referendum in their respective States for the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment they would be pursuing a course not subject to criticism , an orderly , dignified course . But their referendums in the forms submitted are for the purpose of undermining and destroying the Constitution through nullification . Criticizes New York Referendum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the State of New York , to be followed , we are told , by similar referendums in other States . The people are not being asked to express themselves in favor of amending the Constitution of the United States , but in favor of the States respectively construing and enforcing the Constitution of the United States . The State of New York long ago repealed its State statute for the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment , declaring thereby that it would not , as a State , assist in enforcing it . Having repealed its State law for enforcement , it now asks that it be permitted to enforce it and that the national Government consent to all this program . Such a program makes Machiavelli seem commonplace and stupid . Those who have expressed some interest in this proposal have been told that it is none of our concern as to what New York State does or what any particular State does . What a State chooses to do with reference to her own purely internal affairs can be only of indirect concern to the people outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guise of taking the advice of the people through a referendum , proposes that which , if effective , will nullify the Constitution of the United States , or any part of it , it is a matter of supreme concern to all the people in every State of the Union . That is a matter concerning which a State can not take action without expecting the deepest interest upon the part of every other State . A State can not take any step which will affect the charter under which we live and claim the right of individual exemption . Under the Constitution we are one people , with a common destiny and with a common purpose  --  a purpose never to be changed , I trust  --  and that is to preserve the underlying principles of order and law which have made us what we are among the proud and powerful nations of the earth . Nullification Not Revolution . A distinguished writer upon this subject of nullification tells us that " nullification is not revolution . it is the safety valve which helps the selfgoverning community avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true , nullification is not revolution . It has none of the sturdy attributes and finer virtues of revolution . It involves none of the courage and sacrifice and willingness to die and is inspired by none of the vision of revolution . It has none of the open , manly qualities of revolution . Nullification is none of these . Nullification is the slinking , silent , cowardly sapping of the very foundation of all order , all dignity , all govern ' ment . It is the furtive , evasive betrayal of a nation . It poisons the very fountain source of national power , to wit , respect for law and obedience to the expressed will of the majority . It is the spirit and motive of anarchy , without either its courage or its faith . Many a revolutionist has earned the commendation of history , but the nullificationist earns but the pity or contempt of his fellows . Bolshevism In Russia , fascism in Italy , military dictatorship in Poland , promised dictatorship in other countries , increase of arbttrary power everywhere and nullification openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the same kennel . They are barking at the same thing , to wit , constitutional government . They all proclaim that democracy has broken down , that parliamentary government is a failure , that constitutional government is a thing of the past , inefficient , cumbersome and out of date . There never has been a time in the history of constitutional government when men should stand so firm in defense of law and order and the orderly procedure by which constitutional rights are guaranteed as at the present time . What we need is not less democracy but more , not less faith in constitutional government , but more . There is no evil that we can not for a time endure ; there is no hardship that we can not afford to forget ; there is no patience which we should not be willing to practice , rather than to aid and abet in this almost worldwide attack upon a constitutional government . Former Representative William H. Fleming of Georgia , who introduced Senator Borah , declared that " the Democratic donkey would break out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Democratic Party should nominate a wet candidate on a wet platform ,
