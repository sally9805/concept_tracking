The First Commoner of the Realm , the Rt . Hon. John Henry Whitley , Speaker of the House of Commons , resigned last week , thus leaving that potent assemblage " voiceless and without mouth . " <P> Entered pompously , in this traditional emergency , Sir Thomas Lonsdale Webster , Clerk of the House . Gesturing in dumb show , he pointed to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin , who then had leave to say that His Majesty would graciously permit his Faithful Commons to choose a new Speaker . <P> Gesturing again , the silent Clerk pointed to a Conservative M. P. , Sir Robert Sanders , who promptly nominated for the Speakership another Conservative , Captain the Rt . Hon. Edward Algernon Fitzroy , son of Baron Southampton , and onetime Page of Honor to Queen Victoria . <P> Thus far the Clerk had gestured only toward benches occupied by supporters of His Majesty 's Government ; but now he pivoted , like some mighty marionette , and faced His Majesty 's Loyal Opposition . Pointing , he designated Laborite Charles Bowerman who obliged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Speaker , " like the King-Emperor , is above parties . <P> Acclaim . The Commons , warming to a ceremony which would last for many hours , elected by acclaim as Speaker onetime Queen 's Page Fitzroy , now a grizzled War veteran of 58 , wounded at Ypres and Klein Zillebecke . He , with a coy modesty demanded by ritual , first demurred at the too-great honor , and then submitted himself to what is known as the Superior Judgment of the House . <P> Still faintly resisting in dumb show , Captain Fitzroy was then led by his Conservative Nominator and Laborite Seconder , who jointly conducted him to the Chair . He was now the Speaker-Elect . The Sergeant at Arms , Admiral Sir Colin Keppel , could and did remove the enormous Mace from under its table and placed it upon the table top. * <P> During the next 24 hours Speaker-Elect Fitzroy became Speaker-very gradually . He listened and replied to speeches of grandiose laudation from all Parties . He was appraised by His Majesty 's Government that the Sovereign had approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bar of the House of Lords and conveyed news of his election to Their Lordships . While he countermarched back to the House of Commons , famed Joy Bells rang out from St. Margaret 's Church across the way . Finally Sir Edward Algernon Fitzroy donned over his court dress the robe and wig of office , rehearsed to the Commons at length all that had happened , and took the Chair as Speaker . <P> Authority . Depending on his temperament , a Speaker may either dominate the House by a smashing exercise of his authority or sink to the obscurity of a mere preserver of order . Last of the titans was <P> Arthur Wellesley Peel ( 1884-95 ) , youngest son of the great Prime Minister , Sir Robert Peel . Naughtiest was Charles Shaw Lefevre ( 1841-57 ) who delighted to cite precedents which did not exist , and would solemnly intone , according to ritual , that his most outrageous decisions were justified by " the well known practice of the House .
