Did Herbert Clark Hoover telephone twice during the Kansas City convention to George W. Norris of Nebraska , the most Insurgent Republican Senator of them all , and ask him to be Number Two Man on the Hoover ticket ? Did Senator Norris refuse , and did Senators Howell of Nebraska and Brookhart of Iowa then call on Senator Norris and beg him to reconsider ? And did Senator Norris then refuse a third time ? Such were the stories told last week in Omaha by one Mat Greevy and the Omaha World-Herald . Newsgatherers considered the stories so improbable that they did not bother to seek denial or confirmation from busy Nominee Hoover , whose door is guarded by a chubby secretary and the expletive : " A lot of foolish nonsense ! " ( see LETTERS . ) <P> Whether or not he thrice refused a coronet , George William Norris did not announce last week . But he announced something else . He said he was hopeless of a Third Party ticket this year . He said that the Issue was the Power Trust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressional candidates this year , regardless of party ticket . He assumed that " nothing new will transpire in the Presidential contest . " Hence the thing for " progressives " to do is to increase their balance of power in Congress and as soon as possible amend the Constitution to provide for direct popular election of the President and Vice President , " obliterating the useless and antiquated Electoral College . " All this Senator Norris set forth in an open letter to a California friend , by way of letting people know that he was clambering on no man 's bandwagon .
