The Re-Discovery of America I : The Last Days ? f Europe TWO traits are new in our America ; we have become critical of ourselves ; we are taking stock of our past . And a third trait is old : we remain careless and fearful of first grin-. ciples . The vogue of Mr. Mencken and the Bab bit-baiters reveals the one trait ; the tonnage of " new " biographies , histories , outlines , claims to : fulfill the second ; the third is plain in the super ? ficial stuffs that the first two traits give us . But our fresh interests , since they imply judgment , can ? not be valid if they do not rise from a valid premise . Any conclusion , however logical and bright , is false save it be the fruit of sound first principles . In our day , such principles are lacking ; they are not even sought for . Our most considered critics plume themselves on the fact that their judg ? ments have no philosophy behind them . The in ? dependence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adolescent will ; it has become our excuse for gliding on the surface of events and moods . A critical attitude may be as fatuous as the self-adulation it reacts from . The stomach sick of sugar may crave sour without becoming a wiser or a better stomach . The man who calls life a bad name , when he is tired of the pretty ones , is not suddenly intelligent . We may observe the antics of an iconoclast as we observe the antics of Al Jol ? son ; because they fit our fancy ? and we have other idols which they flatter . We may enjoy a deroga ? tory life of Washington , quite as our fathers the saccharine myth of Pastor Weems , because both meet a complacent , contemporary mood . This is the case . Once Americans needed to worship heroes ; the " critical " note was not respectable . Now , in our life of peripheral glitter and abysmal dark , we are afraid of heroes ; ' we deny nobility in our fathers lest it be a light on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our self-criticism and our taking stock have truly a creative end , we are , in our complacent ignorance of causes , fondly look ? ing for an immaculate conception . America is child and heir of all the pasts ; specifically it is sprung from Europe . In every act we are the effect of the world which organically made us . To create our : future is , clearly , to control it . Thus only may American life achieve the transfigurement of a veri ? table culture . The first step in this process ? the one really human ? is to master the principles of our past , to understand the governable elements of growth within us . I The instinct for hero-worship of course remains . It bursts out hysterically in the " safe " adulation of a man like Lindbergh , whose gesture was entirely without adult connotations . It is therefore practical , in interest of the Amer ? ican destiny , to cut back of America and to consider Europe : it is practical to make some definition of our values as Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mind are alone pragmatic ; discussions of immediate facts about us can be but gilded gossip unless they find their place within a basic attitude toward life . If America would Will spiritual health , to say the obvious , it must grow whole ; for wholeness and health are one . And wholeness is a principle of integration which all the detailed discourse in the world wo n't give us . . ? ? Take Europe as an alive organic body . If you look for its " heart , " for its " mind , " for its " soul " ? in another word , if you look for the source of its energy and spirit , you come upon the Sea whose shores were Egypt , Judwa , Athens , Rome . The Mediterranean was the womb of Europe . In this fertile water was formed the universe , the God , the mind , the Law , the State , the science and the plan of the West . To make an antithesis of the Mediter ? ranean parts is as confusing as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jew have married as they did in Alexandria , how have begotten the Christian world , if their individualities had not been functions of a generic whole ? Where in Saint Paul does Palestine end and Rome begin , The synthesis of the Patrists embraces Semite , Greek and Berber . The old legend that Aristotle visited Jeremiah is , of course , no fact , but is as true as the fact that Pythagoras and YEschylu5 were adepts of Egyptian mysteries , and that Plato had studied the wisdom of Hermes Trismegistus ? The Mediterranean became one spirit , and its bodY was Western Europe . Consider these general convictions : December 14 , 1927 THE NEW The senses give us reality . Reason corrects the senses , giving us reality . c . God , wisdom , faith , supplement and correct senses and reason , giving us reality . to . We know what matter is , even if we can not create it . II . We know what thought is as separate from matter . 12 . The law of cause and effect , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute . 13 . Time and Space are real ; they are independent of our minds ; we are within them , rather than they within us. 14 . Human individuality ? call it soul , spirit , ego exists , not relatively , but really in Time and Space . . . . Here are blocks that made the House ? organs that made the conceptual Body ? of Western Europe . Surety they were , and substance , of the experience of western man . Of course , there were differences of opinion about one and another . Jew , Ionian , Alexandrian , medieval schoolman , had vari ? ant ways of defining all these laws : some were stressed where others were ignored or bravely denied . But differences were not fundamental , were not racial ; were not , in the absurd Spenglerian sense , " cultural " at all . Plato and Aristotle dis ? agreed about substance and God , and both were Greeks . Pharisee and Sadducee fought about vir ? tue and damnation and were yet Jews . One man of Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman with his brother . By and large , these laws established the spiritual anatomy of Europe . Within them men lived and died , and created beauty and found truth : men before Isaiah , men after Shakespeare . . . . Consider these laws , in the light of modern thought : you will find that every one of them is pne . They were the foundation blocks of our Puse ; they have vanished . We can not dwell on the Process of their disappearance ; for that process largely the history of modern times . Copernicus , Kepler wrecked our comfortable cosmos . , amarck , Goethe , Darwin worked at our biological ethronement . The sure structure of our faith and reason , wherein resided our certainties of the true , the beautiful and the gOod , had been already chal-1a ng*ed by the smothered heresy of Duns Scotus , i , 11 ) 0 declared the will as independent of the intel- lee t . Now came Kant , Berkeley , Hume , Hegel , ' ehopenhauer , Freud to make havoc of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to know and power to judge . The re7sical universe began to crumble . Euclid proved SS able to explain the world 's behavior than such 44ntastic geometers as Lobachevski , Gauss , Mon ? th ? Wski . Matter dissolved . The atom became a : ngeries of mere movement . " The stable foundations , , bro. " says Dr. Whitehead , " of physics have are " 11 up ? the old foundations of scientific , though Space M uecomino- unintelligible . Time , rial , Ether , Electricity , Mechanism , Organism , Configuration , Structure , Pattern , Function . . all require re-interpretation . " The Law of cause and effect , body of the logic of our lives , followed in the abyss . European man , bereft of revelation , fell back on the science of sense ; bereft of that , he fell back , for surety , on self . Now the surety of self was taken from him . If Time and Space might be configurations of his thinking , cause and effect became mere relative se ? quence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this Time and Space was turned destructively upon itself . The great Body of western experience broke down ; and we were hurled into the modern chaos . You can gauge the state of Europe 's cultural decomposition , by contrasting it with the Body wherein Dante dwelt . Everything there had its place , moved with purposive rhythm into the Whole . From God to priest , from Emperor to serf , from Heaven to Hell , from star to atom , from good to evil , all was integral . This was a world , moreover , in which Dante lived together with his cook . This Whole is gone . But organic death does not mean inanition . Look at any corpse ad ? vanced in its decay , and see how live it is . Europe swarms in its death . The man of science might " prove " the death of a body in several ways . He might analyze metabol ? ism , blood or lymph , and come to the same result as if he simply said : " The heart has stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , from each in ? dividual cell , still living , were he wise enough , he might configure the whole death . The method here has been purposely abstract , since abstraction is short-cutting . The essence of a living body is an " I " ; it is articulate in self-interested action , and possibly in words . The " I " of Europe fades . It no longer acts , no longer speaks , no longer possesses unitary concepts . Study the disintegration of religion . Observe the withdrawal in the " Renaissance " of the arts from science , and of the artist from the world . Note how the mind of Europe , which once had a lan ? guage -- Latin --  -- now mumbles in disparate accents ; how nation stands shut against nation , class against class , clique against clique , and person against per ? son . Radio , telegraph , " movie , " like the palavers of diplomacy and trade , are noises emitted by spe ? cial social appetites or cells : they are no Word : whatever Word remains they render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been one of frantic efforts to reclaim this dimming and dissolving Whole . Nationalism replaced the passionate ideal of brotherhood in Christ . The internationalism of Karl Marx strove to knit one class across frontiers and , since the hierarchic order was no longer valid , to make a heaVen of homogeneous classlessness . Perhaps the clearest token of this break-up is the separation of the Church and the State . This sep ? aration has become an arrogant ideal , whereas it should be the confession of man 's failure . If Church and State mean anything at all , their divorce is that of spirit and body , of thought and deed . To make of this a social goal is to crown chaos . Re ? ligion and politics must form a whole , if either is to be a part of health . The peace that is gained by disestablishing their union is the peace of death . Europe glories in this euthanasia . It goes farther : it divorces actual from formal government ; subtly in such lands as France , graciously in Great Britain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mind goes another , body goes a third . Spirit is dis ? embodied ; body is lightless . . . . Pick out your own proof of the death in Europe . . . . The life of western man as an organic Body reaches fullness in what we call the Middle Ages . With rigorous selection , the thought and form of the Mediterranean world is here made integral of a Whole which each man shares . Aristotle , Plato , Plotinus , the Prophets , the Patrists , the knights , the monks , are men who builded it ? and all men live it . Pope Gregory VII , who declared Rome 's uni ? tary lordship , makes for it a heart . Aquinas gives it logic and a mind . Dante and Wolfram ' and Petrarch sing its ultimate song . Its flaws are fatal , and we shall understand them when we consider what it meant by Knowledge and by action . But its splendor is immortal ; for it is the first conscious attempt of occidental man to create with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its symbol is the Mediterranean Sea which moth eyed it : the sunlit , bounded , middle water . Now , at its height , it begins to die . And the symbol of its death is the Atlantic . In no true sense was America discovered by Co ? lumbus . He , Vasco da Gama , and the explorers who followed , touched shores that were margins of far countries . They discovered the Ocean . The ' Way found by Columbus is the antithesis of the Latin Sea : it is uncharted , it leads to limitless lands . Its unboundedness is the symbol of that old symbol 's ' - passing . Men 's thoughts and ' dreams had bridged the Mediterranean . For ages , east and west , south and north , the littorals had mingled . Europe came of this . Now , parabola-wise , men 's dreams move to the Ocean and Europe begins to die . The conquest of world power , by arms and science ; the political crumbling of the Catholic State ; the religious vagrancies that follow Luther ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , are traits of Europe 's dis7. location . And they are traits , as well , of the new  --  Way ? the Atlantic . A body breaks . Potent but no more intact , its energy flows outward . In wholeness , it had been contingent upon God alone : the Gothic spires had expressed it , a universe turned upward . It becomes a multiverse turned horizontal . For it is breaking .. Europe bleeds sea-ward , into terrestrial unknowps . And the old Mediterranean dies . Into the At " lantic flows its death : the new search of man , the new earth-wise boundlessness . Beyond the symbolic Ocean there will be found- a land , misnamed at first , misjudged , not yet re ? vealed : America . WALDO FRANK , Lady , Save Those Mineral Salts !

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the group while the meal was being cooked , and our close attention to Mr. Jack ? son as he moved among his pots and pans , demon ? . strating the alleged superiority of his brand of kitchen utensils ( price $192.20 for the complete set ) over any other brand now in use . Later we were to have a forty-minute talk by the chief selling agent . We were also expected to give a polite reception to an agent who would call at each of our homes the next day to take orders . ( If you do n't care for the entire set , madam , we can give you the essential pieces for $166.75 , or three saucepans for $19. ) 1 The author of " P. 7.114 " While we dined at the expense of the Club Aluminum Company , thousands of other persons in cities from coast to coast were being similarly entertained . The company , organized in Illinois in 1923 , has found that the advertising method of free demonstration meals pays well . Witness its financial report in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chronicle : " Net profits of the company for the current fiscal year will probably reach $1,500,000 after charges and taxes , accord ' ing to President William A.
