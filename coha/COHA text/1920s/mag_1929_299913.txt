In Manhattan last week , Dr. Hannah M. Stone and her associates who taught a woman how to control conception ( TIME . April 39 ) , were discharged in magistrate 's ( police ) court . The magistrates decided that New York State laws permit a doctor to give birth control instruction when the doctor acts in good faith . Instruction may be to unmarried as well as married women , so far as the New York law indicates . Unsatisfied with freedom alone , the Stone group insisted upon knowing who instigated their arrest . They suspected Roman Catholics and said so . Police Commissioner Grover Aloysius Whalen avoided a direct answer . But he demoted the policewoman who had led the raid against the birth-controllers . <P> <P> Nursing Anniversaries <P> After their ritualistic chores were done for last Sunday , Manhattan 's Episcopal Bishop William Thomas Manning and Baptist Harry Emerson Fosdick proceeded that evening to the former 's Cathedral of St. John the Divine . There theocrat and minister watched 2,000 trained nurses march up the aisle and take their rustling seats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white dress and redlined blue cape . It indicated both that she had been graduated from a high school and that she had taken special courses in war nursing . Most of those at the Cathedral had served in the World War , a few in the Spanish-American War . <P> The occasion for the gathering was the 109th birth anniversary of the late great Nurse Florence Nightingale , the founder of trained nursing , who died in 1910 . <P> May also marks the founding of the League of Red Cross Societies by the late great Henry Pomeroy Davison . Red Cross work is the outgrowth of Florence Nightingale 's nursing British soldiers during England 's Crimean War against Russia and of the Swiss philanthropist Henri Dunant 's description of suffering in the battle of Solferino ( 1859 ) . Formal organization of war nursing began at Geneva in 1864 . During the World War , such nursing was well organized . Perhaps most efficient was the American Red Cross which Davison headed .

In early May typhoid fever appeared at Fort Churchill on Hudson Bay . The nearest hospital was 183 miles away at The Pas . A few patients got through the blizzard . Twelve , on a train , with three score nurses , physicians and railway employes , were snowed in . Three locomotives could not pull them free . Food grew low . Snow was melted for drink . Engine fires were killed to save fuel . Telephone poles were chopped down for more heat . After days a dog team passed by . The hungry trainload confiscated its provender . Rescuers brought food and medicine by horse and hand sleighs . Finally the blizzards subsided . Three engines managed to break through the drifts and help the first three lug the typhoid victims to hospitals . Only one patient died . <P>                @ @ @ @ @
