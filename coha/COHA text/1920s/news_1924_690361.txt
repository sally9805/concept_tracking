txt A Sane Thought From the South . From The Chattanooga ( Tenn . ) Times . ? ? ? The Republican Party has named a ticket better than its platform , and the Democrats will have to do the same or court defeat . No second-rate politicians with any sort of taint in their records will satisfy or meet the test . Opportunism will not win in the selection of leaders in this emergency . Vote catching may be a motive in platform making , but it will be a dangerous business applied to naming a Presidential ticket . The man for President must stand four-square ; he must be big enough to cover the nation , brave enough to meet the issues of a badly disarranged country and patriotic enough to guarantee to all the blessings of fair , square and just treatment . Ile must not be a time-server , a trimmer or a " specialist " for any interest , Just to all , true to the - standards of American equality and freedom of thought , speech and conscience  --  the man the Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this convention . therefore , is greater than that imposed upon a like representative assembly in a generation .
