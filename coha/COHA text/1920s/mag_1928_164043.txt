Mrs. Alma Petty Gatlin went to the Rev. Thomas F. Pardue , in Reidsville , N. C. , to confess her sins . She told him that she had killed her father and was sorry . The Rev. Thomas F. Pardue accepted her confession and told the police . Mrs. Petty was tried for murdering her father ; despite Thomas Pardue 's testimony , which was admitted , the jury found Mrs. Petty not guilty . That was two weeks ago ( TIME , March 5 ) . <P> It has always been taken for granted by most people that the things they tell their confessors are twice-sealed secrets . Southern newspapers commented on the actions of the Rev. Thomas F. Pardue . <P> Said the Birmingham ( Ala . ) Age Herald : " . . . Many persons will feel that the preacher erred , that his lips should have been sealed . . . . " <P> Said the Columbia ( S. C. ) Record : " . . . We imagine penitents in his sector will find other confessors , who hold confidences sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americus ( Ga . ) Times Recorder : " We rather think it a case of religious fanaticism running wild . Pardue is . . . wrapped in his little shell of self-conceit . . . he used underhand methods . . . he soiled the cloth he wears . And what good has his babbling accomplished ? . . . He created a furor in his woodland village and he had the pleasure of seeing his name and picture in the papers . . . . For a few days he was a big pig in a little pen . . . . "
