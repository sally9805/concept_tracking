He just rang me up on the phone . ( Looking at phone . ) And how he knew this number and located me , I ca n't understand at all . That 's one of the things I 'm worried about . p. 26 DR . HEARN ( still groping in the bag ) . I see . JOSEPH MEADOWS Well , as I passed them by , I could tell that they were at it , hammer and tongs . I heard him say , " I 've got a good mind to slap you right in the face . " DR . HEARN He said to her ? JOSEPH MEADOWS He said , yes . And she said , " I dare you to do it . " DR . HEARN She dared him to do it ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Yes , she kept repeating it  --  " I dare you to do it . I dare you to do it . I dare you to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , eh ? JOSEPH MEADOWS No , I kept on going , until I heard her scream . DR . HEARN She screamed ? JOSEPH MEADOWS I kept on going , and she kept on screaming . DR . HEARN I see ; and then what ? JOSEPH MEADOWS I lost control of myself . My blood boiled , and I ran back and grabbed him . DR . HEARN You grabbed him ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Right by the collar , and I shook him like a rat . p. 27 DR . HEARN Good , then what ? JOSEPH MEADOWS He punched me in the eye . DR . HEARN I see . ( Goes around to R. of MEADOWS . Examining eye again . ) ( EVANS enters from R.U.E . with alcohol and towel . ) And I do n't mind telling you it was some punch . JOSEPH MEADOWS You have n't got to tell me . I know all about it . EVANS ( now is at R. of HEARN C. ) . The alcohol , Doctor . DR . HEARN ( takes it ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) EVANS Anything else , sir ? DR . HEARN ( as he goes to table L. , with bag , etc . ) . Yes . Let me know when the housekeeper 's ready for me upstairs . EVANS Yes , sir . ( Taking a look at MEADOWS as he turns and goes to stairs and up . ) ( Exits up the stairs . ) DR . HEARN ( as he is fixing towel round MEADOWS ' neck and getting cotton saturated with alcohol ) . We 'll clean this off first , and then see if we can make you look a little more presentable . ( Now applying cotton on eye . ) Does it burn ? p. 28 JOSEPH MEADOWS Not much . DR . HEARN ( working on eye ) . What happened after he hit you ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Well , naturally , I was dazed for the moment . It was all so unexpected . DR . HEARN You 've got to expect the unexpected when you get into a rough-and-tumble . JOSEPH MEADOWS By the time I got my bearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . HEARN He took it on the run , eh ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Yes , and there was I alone , with a screaming woman . DR . HEARN She was still screaming ? JOSEPH MEADOWS At the top of her voice . ( NOTE .  --  HEARN keeps on working all the time except when something particular amuses him and he has to laugh , but he tries to conceal his amusement from MEADOWS . ) DR . HEARN ( as he goes to above table for more applications ) . A crowd collected , I suppose ? JOSEPH MEADOWS A crowd ? You 'd have thought it was a Cup Tie . They came from all directions . I dare say that most of them thought it was she and I having the fight . p. 29 DR . HEARN ( laughing good-naturedly , as he goes to R. of MEADOWS to work on eye ) . You were lucky that someone else did n't punch you . JOSEPH MEADOWS That probably would have happened , too , if the policeman on point duty had n't come running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , luckily I have a bowing acquaintance with him . He seemed to sense that I 'd innocently got myself into a mess , so he helped the girl and me through the crowd , and into a taxi . DR . HEARN ( now at table again , busy with lint , etc . ) . You got her into a taxi ? JOSEPH MEADOWS I had to drag her into the taxi . DR . HEARN Still screaming ? JOSEPH MEADOWS I never heard anything like it in all my life . DR . HEARN What happened then ? JOSEPH MEADOWS She fainted . DR . HEARN In the taxi ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Yes . I got the driver to pull up at a chemist 's shop , got some smelling-salts , and she finally came to . DR . HEARN And then what ? p. 30 JOSEPH MEADOWS I offered to take her home . She said she was afraid to go there . DR . HEARN I see . JOSEPH MEADOWS Then I offered to take her to her mother 's home . She said her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any friend 's home I could take her to . She said she had no friends , except her husband 's friends , and that they were no friends of hers . DR . HEARN And so you brought her here ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Not right away . When we came out of the chemist 's , we went for a stroll . When we got down as far as Victoria Station she did n't feel well , so we went into the waiting-room and sat down . We were there for a solid hour . DR . HEARN ( working on eye ) . Doing what ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Talking  --  that is , she talked , and I listened . DR . HEARN Listened to what ? JOSEPH MEADOWS The story of her married life . DR . HEARN ( now going to table for more applications ) . Unhappy ? JOSEPH MEADOWS She never stopped crying all the time we were there . I was afraid the people around would think I was abusing her . p. 31 DR . HEARN ( laughs to himself ) . Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said . She was a stenographer in the same office where he was a book-keeper . That 's where they met . DR . HEARN ( now coming to R. of MEADOWS again , to work on eye ) . You got the whole history ? JOSEPH MEADOWS We were there an hour , I tell you . DR . HEARN Well , what 's all their trouble about ? JOSEPH MEADOWS It 's about a pet dog . DR . HEARN A pet dog ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Yes , he took the dog out for a walk this morning , and purposely lost it . DR . HEARN You do n't say ! Purposely lost it , eh ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Yes . The cutest little Pekinese you ever looked at . DR . HEARN Oh , you saw the dog ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Not the original , No . She showed me its picture in a little locket that she wears around her neck . DR . HEARN She wears the dog 's picture in a locket ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Yes , and he took exception to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sane and sensible man being jealous of a poor little pet dog ? p. 32 DR . HEARN ( snickers as he goes to table again ) . And that 's why he took the dog out and lost it , eh ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Well , of course , he claims that the dog ran away . But she 's convinced that it was the other way around . That he ran away from the dog . DR . HEARN I see . JOSEPH MEADOWS I feel awfully sorry for this girl , Doctor . She wept all over the place trying to tell me about all the little tricks it did , and how intelligent it was , and can you imagine  --  ( as he points to phone )  --  this husband of hers being small-minded enough to want her to take the dog 's picture out of the locket , and put his in ? Would n't you call that just about the last word in bull-headedness ? ( HEARN has a hearty laugh at this . ) I do n't blame you for laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( still laughing as he comes to R. of MEADOWS to finish up his job ) . Silliest damned thing I ever heard . If the dog 's lost , all she 'll have to do is to advertise and offer a reasonable reward . She 'll get it back . JOSEPH MEADOWS But he wo n't let her advertise . DR . HEARN Oh ! p. 33 JOSEPH MEADOWS That 's what the scrap 's all about . DR . HEARN He wo n't let her advertise ! JOSEPH MEADOWS He says , " The dog 's gone . Let it go . " DR . HEARN Oh , I see . ( Stands off to R. and looks at the job he 's done on the eye . Goes to above table to clean up his instruments . ) ( NOTE .  --  At this point CRANDALL is coming down the stairs , and exits out R.U.E. , looking at MEADOWS as she goes out . ) JOSEPH MEADOWS Of course , the one unforgivable thing is slapping the girl in the face . I ca n't stand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impossible common bully . I could tell that by my conversation with him over the phone . DR . HEARN Well , I 'm finished . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( rising quickly and taking towel off from around his neck and placing it on table R. ) . Thanks , Doctor . DR . HEARN ( still above table L. ) . Tell me , what are you going to do with this girl , now that you have got her on your hands ? JOSEPH MEADOWS ( coming to HEARN ) . I do n't know . Can you offer any advice ? ( CRANDALL now re-enters from R.U.E . with tea-kettle , and is rushing upstairs , taking another look at MEADOWS as she goes. ) p. 34 DR . HEARN I 'll have another look at her directly and see what condition she 's in , and then we 'll talk it over . JOSEPH MEADOWS Well , let 's do it at once , will you , Doctor ? I 've got to hurry out of here in a few minutes . I 've got to square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as they are ready for me upstairs . ( Takes hand-mirror out of bag . ) Well , there now ! You look fairly respectable . ( Goes to MEADOWS and hands him mirror . ) See for yourself . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( takes mirror , looks into it ) . Oh , that 's great ! ( Starts to touch it . ) DR . HEARN Keep your hands away from it . I 'll look in to-morrow morning , and if the discoloration 's bad , I 'll paint it up a little more . ( Has taken mirror from MEADOWS and goes to table L. to pack away his things in his bag . ) ( NOTE .  --  EVANS has anticipated cue and is coming downstairs . ) JOSEPH MEADOWS A thousand thanks for this . You 've helped me out of an awful hole . EVANS ( now at L. of stairway  --  to HEARN ) . All right , Doctor . p. 35 DR . HEARN ( looks up at EVANS ) . Ready for me ? EVANS So Miss Crandall said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having had time enough to pack everything , leaving some on the table and starting for R. To MEADOWS as he is going ) . You 'd better stay here till I come down . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( walking up with HEARN toward stairway ) . Make it as quick as you can , will you , please ? DR . HEARN I wo n't waste any time . Do n't you fret . I 'll be finished up here very shortly . ( Moving up the stairs hurriedly , and exits . ) JOSEPH MEADOWS ( to EVANS , who is at L. of stairs , trying to get a good look at MEADOWS ' eye . To EVANS , as he crosses below him to stage L. ) . Another glass of sherry , Evans . EVANS Glass of sherry ? Yes , sir . ( Starts off R. , but stops when outer door bell rings at L.U.E. He turns and takes a step down stage R. , looks at MEADOWS , who is up stage C. , and MEADOWS turns and looks at EVANS . ) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . The door bell rings again . Both men stop suddenly ) p. 36 JOSEPH MEADOWS ( slowly turning to EVANS ) . See who that is . EVANS ( crossing stage below MEADOWS to door L.U.E. ) . Yes , sir . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( as EVANS reaches door at L. ) . And remember what I told you . EVANS ( turning in doorway , to MEADOWS ) . Yes , sir . ( Exits . ) ( MEADOWS takes stage to R.C. at L. of couch , facing door L.U.E. ) ( Door slam , short pause , and then EVANS ' voice is heard in hallway outside . ) I 'm sorry , sir , but you 'll have to wait till you 're announced . ( JIM HURLEY 'S voice is now heard in the hallway . ) JIM HURLEY ( outside ) . There is n't going to be any announcement . Go on , get out of the way . EVANS I have my instructions , sir . JIM HURLEY To hell with your instructions . Get out of the way , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.C. , looking at MEADOWS , who is at R.C. Shows that he is dead sure of himself . EVANS enters and comes down between the two men , giving JIM a hard look as he passes above him . To MEADOWS. ) p. 37 EVANS ( apologetically to MEADOWS ) . I 'm sorry , sir , but it was utterly impossible to  --  JOSEPH MEADOWS ( interrupts , without taking his eyes off JIM ) . I understand  --  it 's all right , Evans . JIM HURLEY ( after deliberating , moves slowly up to EVANS ) . Go on , get out of here . ( EVANS gives JIM a look , then turns to MEADOWS . ) JOSEPH MEADOWS ( to JIM ) . If there are any orders to be given in this house , I 'll attend to it . JIM HURLEY ( to MEADOWS ) . All right . Get him out of here . I want to talk to you alone . JOSEPH MEADOWS Do you intend talking sensibly ? JIM HURLEY That 's all up to you . I 'm ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all the same to me . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( after juggling this  --  to JIM ) . Sit down , please . JIM HURLEY ( after taking a look at MEADOWS , and then at EVANS . To MEADOWS . ) Yes , I will . ( Moves to chair R. of table L. ) I certainly will . ( Sits in chair , wiping face with kerchief . ) Because I 've got quite a little to say to you . ( Never softens his manner , and glares at EVANS with contempt. ) p. 38 JOSEPH MEADOWS You may go , Evans . EVANS Shall I call a policeman , sir ? JOSEPH MEADOWS ( a bit annoyed , waves EVANS out with a nod of the head ) . It 's all right , go on . ( EVANS looks at JIM and JIM , who has been glaring at EVANS , waves to EVANS to get out . EVANS resents this by giving JIM a hard look , and turns to MEADOWS . MEADOWS again nods to EVANS to go . EVANS turns again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R.U.E. ) ( To JIM . ) Well , sir ? JIM HURLEY ( quietly , but means it ) . How about sitting down yourself ? JOSEPH MEADOWS ( coldly ) . I prefer to stand . JIM HURLEY Well , I want you to sit down . And I want you to listen to me , too . JOSEPH MEADOWS You listen to me first . Your wife is in another part of this house . She 's very ill . JIM HURLEY What 's the matter with her ? JOSEPH MEADOWS On the verge of a nervous collapse . JIM HURLEY ( shaking his head and smiling bitterly ) . I feel pretty rotten , but I 've got to laugh at that . p. 39 JOSEPH MEADOWS What do you mean ? JIM HURLEY I knew she 'd try that on . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( sternly ) . Now , look here , young fellow , if you 've come here to kick up a row , I want to warn you that  --  JIM HURLEY ( interrupts ) . I did n't come to kick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head as soon as I found out who you were . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( straightens up proudly ) . Oh , then you know who I am ? ( Still standing at R.C. left end of couch R. ) JIM HURLEY Of course I do . And I found out where you lived too , did n't I ? I suppose you 're wondering how . ( Still seated . ) Listen , I never lost sight of you from the minute I took a punch at you till you walked into this house . When I hit you and got away , I did n't go any farther than the opposite side of the street . When you and she hopped in that taxi , I hopped in another and followed you all the way to the station , and I watched you all the time you were there too . Then I followed you back up here . I found out who you were from the porter of the block of flats across the street . I 've kept my eye on this house all the time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to bust in unless I had to . You see , when I found out who you were , I began to feel sort of sorry about punching you in the eye , but you 've got to admit that it was your own fault ; you should mind your own business . ( MEADOWS resents this . ) Now , do n't get annoyed just because I 'm talking straight . You know I 'm right . You behaved like an old woman  --  now , honestly , did n't you ? p. 40 JOSEPH MEADOWS You just said that you did n't come here to kick up a row . JIM HURLEY ( gets up ) . Well , I did n't . ( Going over to MEADOWS . ) And I did n't come here to apologize either . JOSEPH MEADOWS What right had you slapping this girl in the face ? JIM HURLEY All the right in the world if I wanted to . She 's my wife . JOSEPH MEADOWS Does being married to a woman give you the right to slap her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to face ) . Are you married ? JOSEPH MEADOWS No , but I expect to be . JIM HURLEY Well , do n't argue till you 're eligible . ( After looking MEADOWS in the eye , moves away to L. Pause , then turning to MEADOWS . ) Besides , if it 's any news to you , I did n't slap her in the face . Now , what do you think of that ? ( No reply . JIM comes back to MEADOWS . ) Did you see me slap her in the face ? JOSEPH MEADOWS I heard you threaten to . JIM HURLEY But , did you see me do it ? You did not . ( Taking a step to L. , then turning . ) You heard her scream and took it for granted , and you ran back and butted in . ( JIM walks up stage , and comes down again to MEADOWS . ) It is n't the first time  --  it is n't the first time she 's tried that scream on me , and I 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion . p. 41 JOSEPH MEADOWS ( thinking this over for a second ) . You mean to say that she JIM HURLEY ( interrupts ) . I mean to say just what I came here to say . That I never laid a hand on a woman in all my life , and she knows it , and takes advantage of it , too . ( Taking a step up to L. ) . If I was made that way , I 'd have knocked her head off long ago . ( Coming down to MEADOWS quickly . ) Listen , Mr. Meadows , she 's my wife , and I love her . Whether you believe that or not , I do . I 'm mad about her . I 'd have to be , to put up with her . To tell you the truth , I do n't think I could live without her . But that does n't alter the fact that she 's the meanest , most tantalizing impossible woman on God 's green earth . ( Moving down L. , then turning to MEADOWS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this over , and then sits on couch R. , facing front . ) I tell you she 's impossible when she wants to be . And believe me , she wants to be most of the time . ( After taking a walk up stage , he comes down to MEADOWS . ) Now understand me , Mr. Meadows , it is n't easy to come here and say all these things to a stranger , but I made up my mind to prove to you what a damned fool you were to nose your way into something that did n't concern you at all . ( At this point , HEARN is seen coming downstairs . He gets to about the middle of the stairs , and on seeing JIM , he stops and listens for a second , then turns and walks back upstairs . ) ( To MEADOWS . ) Two or three times while you were sitting in the station , I was tempted to rush over and punch you in the other eye . ( MEADOWS , who is sitting on couch , looks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to wait and see how far the thing would go . I could n't get close enough to you to hear what she was saying to you , but I knew she was talking about that damned dog , because I saw her show you the picture . ( After a pause , he grabs chair from table L. and pulls it over to MEADOWS and sits . ) Now listen , Mr. Meadows , no matter what she 's told you , these are the real facts . She 's got a good husband , even if I do say it myself , and she 's got a good home , and all the little things that go with it : a piano , a wireless , and a Baby Austin . I get fifty pounds a month , and she gets forty of it . Can a man go any farther than that ? ( He gets up , and is moving away to L. ) ( MEADOWS also gets up , watching JIM . ) I did n't come here to tell my family history , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) But I want you to know that she 's pulled this hysterical stunt several times before , and always finishing up in somebody else 's house every time it happens . ( Crossing away to L. again . MEADOWS turns , and taking another look up towards stairway , now sits in chair that JIM has pulled over to L. of couch R. thinking this over . Coming back to MEADOWS . ) And listen , about the pet dog business , it 's all over and finished . That 's all over . No more dog . Never again in my house , not if I can help it . I want a little consideration myself . Not that I dislike the dog , or anything like that . As a matter of fact , I was kind of fond of it . It was a nice little dog as far as dogs go . Very cute . A shaggy little thing , pop eyes . Looked surprised all the time . Well , you know , you saw the picture . p. 42 JOSEPH MEADOWS Cyclone ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a name for a Pekinese . Is n't it ? ( As he takes stage L. ) The fellow I bought it from told me it was born in a storm . I should say he was right . ( Turns to MEADOWS . ) Well , I stood it as long as I could . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( still seated in chair ) . So you took the dog out and purposely lost it ? JIM HURLEY ( coming over close to MEADOWS ) . Listen , Mr. Meadows . The dog is n't lost . It 's got a good home . I saw to that . JOSEPH MEADOWS Oh , then you did n't lose the dog ? JIM HURLEY It 's got a good home , I tell you . And that 's what I expect to have from now on . ( HEARN is now descending the stairs . ) All I 'm looking for is a fair chance . Do you understand me ? ( Walks to L. below table L. , then turns to MEADOWS . ) Do you believe what I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep thought , seemingly unable to make up his mind whether or not to reply , and trying to figure what to say , in case he does. ) p. 43 DR . HEARN ( who has been listening , coming down C. to R. , and answers the question for MEADOWS . Clears his throat as he is coming down C. between the two characters ) . Well , I do n't know whether Mr. Meadows believes you or not , but I do . ( JIM and MEADOWS both look up in surprise at HEARN . ) ( To JIM . ) I 've been standing at the head of the stairs , listening to your story . ( JIM , who is below table L. , listening to HEARN , takes a step towards him . ) It 's all right , that 's part of my business to know about my patients . I 'm Dr. Hearn . I 've been attending your wife . JIM HURLEY ( to HEARN ) . Oh , is that so ? Where is she ? DR . HEARN Quieted down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was . I asked you where she was . DR . HEARN ( indicates ) . Upstairs in bed . JIM HURLEY In bed ? ( Takes a step down stage with glaring look at MEADOWS . ) DR . HEARN Do n't get excited . Mr. Meadows ' housekeeper is watching over her . She 's quite all right . Of course , everything has been done at my suggestion . p. 44 JIM HURLEY ( to HEARN ) . She 's going to stay here all night ? DR . HEARN That 's up to you . JIM HURLEY ( angrily ) . It 's up to her to put her clothes on , and come home , where she belongs . ( Walking below table L. to around and L. of same , facing HEARN . ) DR . HEARN Suppose you see how she feels about it ? ( CRANDALL is seen coming downstairs . ) JIM HURLEY ( now coming to HEARN above table L. HEARN is at L.C. ) . I do n't care how she feels about it . I wo n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get excited . You can have your own way , my boy . CRANDALL ( now at bottom of stairway . To HEARN ) . Excuse me , Doctor . Did you say two or three of these tablets ? DR . HEARN ( who has turned up stage . To CRANDALL ) . I said three , but we 'll leave all that for the moment , until this gentleman has seen and talked with the patient . ( Indicates JIM . ) Kindly show him the room , Miss Crandall . This is the young woman 's husband . p. 45 CRANDALL ( comes down off the steps , and taking a look at JIM ) . Oh ! ( Goes back to mount stairs . ) DR . HEARN ( indicates stairs . To JIM ) . This way . JIM HURLEY Thanks . ( Starts below HEARN R. ) JOSEPH MEADOWS ( who has been seated in chair L. of couch R. all this time . Quickly ) . Just a moment , please . ( Gets up from chair , and meets JIM up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that I admire the straightforward way you 've put this whole matter before me . You 're absolutely right . I had no business to interfere . I was a damned fool . I apologize . ( Extends hand . ) JIM HURLEY ( taking his hand ) . It 's nice of you to say that . ( Another thought . ) I 'm sorry about your eye . JOSEPH MEADOWS I 'm not . You 've opened them both wider than they ever were before . JIM HURLEY ( smiles ) . I think you 're very sporting . JOSEPH MEADOWS I 'm sure you are . ( Both men look at each other for a second , then JIM starts for stairs , and on mounting stairs turns back and takes another look at MEADOWS , and with a smile he goes up the stairs and off . CRANDALL , who has been standing half-way up the stairs waiting for JIM , precedes him off , showing the way . ) ( HEARN , who has taken his position above table L. during the scene between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is watching JIM off . ) ( To HEARN as he goes to take hold of the chair L. of couch which JIM has pulled out and now is putting it back in place to R. of table L. Speaking as he is doing so . ) Well , there you are ! This all goes to prove how far a man can go when he 's convinced he 's doing the right thing . p. 46 DR . HEARN ( who is busy packing away his instruments , etc. , on table L. ) . Yes , it 's a pretty dangerous pastime , this business of mixing in married people 's personal troubles . Of course , I did n't want to say anything , but  --  JOSEPH MEADOWS ( at table L. , leaning on chair which he just moved . Interrupting ) . But do n't you see , Doctor , I actually thought he 'd slapped her face . DR . HEARN Even if he had ! JOSEPH MEADOWS But he did n't . He just took a solemn oath that he 'd never raised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HEARN Well , look here , Meadows . She said she did n't tell you that he 'd slapped her in the face . JOSEPH MEADOWS Well , no . She did n't exactly tell me that he did , but she did n't deny it . DR . HEARN ( chuckles ) . They all work the same . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( shaking his head hopelessly , as he goes to look upstairs ) . How do women get that way , Doctor ? DR . HEARN ( who is still busying himself packing his bag ) . They do n't get that way . They 're born that way . You know , from what you 've told me and what she 's told me , and from what I overheard him telling you , I gather that this fellow has a lot to put up with . p. 47 JOSEPH MEADOWS ( at C. To HEARN ) . You mean about the dog ? DR . HEARN Yes. Now , I like dogs . I like all animals . But some of these women carry this dog joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man finds himself playing second fiddle to one of them : especially in his own home . Most of the chaps I know grin and bear it , but they hate it just the same . I 've seen a lot of it , I know . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( goes to look upstairs again ) . I hope he gets her out of here . DR . HEARN He will . You heard what he said . ( Takes bag off table , changing subject . Takes a step C. ) How does the eye feel ? JOSEPH MEADOWS ( coming to HEARN ) . It feels pretty good , Doctor . DR . HEARN ( looks at watch ) . I 'll run in to-morrow morning and have another look at it . ( Extends hand . ) JOSEPH MEADOWS I wish you would . I 've got a lot of business to , tend to to-morrow . ( Taking HEARN 'S hand . ) DR . HEARN ( with a smile ) . Make sure that it 's your own business this time . p. 48 JOSEPH MEADOWS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worry . I 'm cured . ( They shake . ) I 'll go to the door with you . DR . HEARN Oh , do n't bother . ( He starts out towards door at L.U.E. ) JOSEPH MEADOWS No bother at all . ( They exit by L.U.E. ad lib. all the way out . ) DR . HEARN ( outside ) . Good night , Meadows . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( outside ) . Good night , Doctor . ( Door slam . ) ( NOTE .  --  As the two characters exit , EVANS enters from R.U.E . with glass of sherry , and is standing C. , waiting for MEADOWS when he re-enters . MEADOWS enters and slowly comes to above table L. , in deep thought . Not noticing EVANS . ) EVANS ( taking a step towards MEADOWS ) . Here is your sherry , sir . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( looking up ) . Oh , yes , yes , thanks . ( Taking it . ) Get my hat and coat , Evans . ( Drinks sherry , and lays glass on table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quickly up stage to chair up R. for hat and coat . ) JOSEPH MEADOWS And , Evans , look up the Johnsons ' telephone number . Get Miss Webster on the phone and say that I 'm on my way there . EVANS ( coming down with hat and coat ) . Very good , sir . ( Helping on with things . ) JOSEPH MEADOWS ( indicating stairs ) . And , Evans , be very nice to these people . EVANS Yes , sir . JOSEPH MEADOWS Especially to him . EVANS Yes , sir . JOSEPH MEADOWS Get them a taxi , or anything they need . Understand ? EVANS ( moving to R. ) . Perfectly , sir . ( As he goes to table R. and picks up a small tray with wineglass , which he had left in early part of Act . ) I 'll look up the Johnsons ' number immediately . I think it 's on the list .

It always ends that way . JOSEPH MEADOWS All good stories do . ( Slaps him on back good-naturedly . ) You wo n't mind if I run along ? I 've got an important engagement . JIM HURLEY Oh , do n't bother about us . Go right along , Mr. Meadows . JOSEPH MEADOWS You 'll explain to your wife ? JIM HURLEY Sure . She 'll understand .

Then pacing the floor with hands in pockets , looking down at the carpet . He proceeds to give himself a mental whipping , but in doing so , does all his thinking aloud . Goes to table below L. and picks up his hat , stands facing front , mumbles , but is heard. ) p. 52 JIM HURLEY What I should have done was to punch her in the eye , instead of punching him in the eye .

Yes , sir , thinking aloud . JIM HURLEY ( turns to EVANS ) . Any objections ? EVANS ( smiles ) . Oh , no , sir . JIM HURLEY ( continues to pace by going towards stairs ) . Then what the hell are you talking about ? p. 53 EVANS I 'm sorry , sir . ( Moves to phone . ) I must deliver a message for Mr. Meadows . JIM HURLEY ( without paying any attention to him ) .

The doctor fixed it , miss . LYDIA WEBSTER A black eye ! Oh , the poor darling ! How did it happen ? EVANS I 'm sure I do n't know , miss , he did n't quite take me into his confidence .

I stopped to admire the little darling in the street . Asked the man if it was for sale . He said no , but that if I would give the dog a good home that he 'd be only too glad to give it to me . Was n't that the most wonderful offer you ever heard of ? EVANS A present , miss ? LYDIA WEBSTER Well , no . I insisted upon binding the bargain .

But I do n't want to wait any longer . I want to go home . I want to go straight home . ( She starts downstairs , followed by JIM , who is likewise followed by CRANDALL . ) JIM HURLEY Another ten minutes ' rest would n't do you any harm . CRANDALL Perhaps getting outdoors and a breath of air will be better for her , after all . JESSIE HURLEY I 'm perfectly all right . I feel very much better . Honestly I do .

Of all the common garden variety of cheap behaviour ! How in Heaven 's name he ever brought such people to the house is beyond me . I 'll never be able to understand it all .

Is he under the couch , Evans ? p. 62 EVANS ( at R. of couch , still on his knees . Looks up  --  to LYDIA ) . I ca n't see him under there , miss . LYDIA WEBSTER Well , get under and see .

LYDIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the same , as  --  the CURTAIN descends. ) @x SCENE .  --  A room in the HURLEYS ' flat . The main entrance is at a door down L. , and another door up L. leads to another part of the flat . The window is dead C. , curtains to same with pelmet . The fireplace is set down stage on the R. wall . Above fireplace is a piano . A couch R. in front of fireplace , set square , a round table above couch and between piano and same . A chair L. of couch at L.C. , a smaller table L.C. , and on its R. a small chair and on its L. an arm-chair . A hatstand is inside and above door down L. , and below door another arm-chair : on the R. of window is a gramophone , and on the L. of window is a wireless cabinet . Carpet , rugs , etc . Locks and keys to both doors . For details , see photograph of scene . ( At rise of CURTAIN , JIM enters from door up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by JESSIE , crossing to R. , then across to lower door L. and up and off by door up L. , then re-entering and coming down R. This business is repeated , finishing JIM R.C. and JESSIE L.C. JESSIE has followed him everywhere , carrying CYCLONE in her arms , is almost hysterical , losing her patience . Speaks . ) JESSIE HURLEY ( at L.C. ) . Why do you keep running away from me all the time ? p. 64 JIM HURLEY ( at R.C. ) . Because I do n't intend to listen to you blubbering like this . What 's the idea ? You 've got your dog back . What are you crying about ? JESSIE HURLEY ( sitting in chair R. of table L. ) . I ca n't help it . I ca n't imagine how you could have done such a thing . ( She is still sobbing . ) To think of your standing in the street and selling the poor little dear. And to the first stranger that came along . I do n't see how you could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HURLEY ( who has been pacing floor resents this ) . What do you mean , unpatriotic ? JESSIE HURLEY Well , then  --  unkind . That 's unpatriotic , is n't it ? JIM HURLEY What was unkind about it ? Twenty people came up to me on the corner and asked me if the dog was for sale . They thought I was a dog-pedlar . I was n't looking for money . I wanted to make sure the dog would be treated right , so when this lady came along I could see that she was not only a woman of wealth but a woman of refinement and would give it a good home . That was our understanding . She offered me twenty pounds ; all I 'd take was a pound note . That was only for good faith . ( Moving away to L. ) Was there anything unkind or selfish about that ? I was giving the dog all the best of it . ( Moving down R. below couch. ) p. 65 JESSIE HURLEY ( still sobbing ) . You did n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( going to her ) . I did n't ask any questions at all . My one idea at that minute was to get rid of the dog , and I thought I had . I never expected to see the woman or the dog again as long as I lived . When she bounced into Meadows ' house to-night with that pup in her arms I was knocked all of a heap . It 's a wonder to me I did n't drop dead . ( Going to window up C. ) JESSIE HURLEY ( bitterly , turning to him ) . It was retribution , that 's what it was . Providence was at work . JIM HURLEY ( turns to her , annoyed at this ) . What 's Providence got to do with it ? JESSIE HURLEY Everything . Providence placed the little thing in that woman 's hands , and brought Mr. Meadows to us , and brought that woman to that house  --  and why did Providence do all these things ? Because Providence felt that a great wrong should be righted , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that , Jim . All such things are arranged in heaven . I should think it would frighten you into being religious and start you going to church again . p. 66 JIM HURLEY ( disgusted , moving up R. ) . Oh , shut up ! JESSIE HURLEY ( rising , following JIM up and back to couch ) . Do n't you talk to me like that . JIM HURLEY ( coming down to her L. ) . Now see here , Jess . You asked me to tell you the truth , and I 've made a clean breast of the whole affair . But if you think I 'm going to listen to any sermon on the subject of " How Providence watches over Pet Dogs " you 're jolly well mistaken . You 've got your dog . It 's here , and I suppose it 's going to stay . JESSIE HURLEY ( sniffling again , sitting on couch ) . It stays , or I do n't . JIM HURLEY ( mopping his neck with handkerchief ) . All right , but under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough understanding . JESSIE HURLEY Understanding ? JIM HURLEY Yes . A set of rules and regulations , and they 've got to be lived up to . JESSIE HURLEY ( whimpering ) . Rules and regulations about what ? JIM HURLEY ( almost yells this speech ) . About the dog . No more damned foolishness . No more baby talk . The dog must not be brought to the table . The dog must not sleep at the foot of the bed . The dog must not be brought along when we go out in the car . The dog must not p. 67 JESSIE HURLEY ( interrupts  --  yells ) . All right ! ( Taking his tone . ) If he does n't go to the table , I do n't go to the table . If he does n't sleep at the foot of the bed , I do n't go to bed . If he does n't go in the car , I do n't go in the car . What are your other rules and regulations ? ( This all defiantly , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JIM HURLEY ( boiling-point , now grabs dog from her and starts for window up C. ) If you say another word I 'll throw that damned dog out of the window . JESSIE HURLEY ( leaping to her feet and coming up C. , facing him ) . You do , you do , and I 'll jump out after him . ( She stands looking at him defiantly . ) The great big Alsatian ! ( JIM looks at her , curbs his temper , and starts slowly towards her , returning dog . Pulls himself together , then appeals to her sense of fairness . JESSIE , in meantime , has gone to resume her seat on couch , talking baby talk to dog . ) JIM HURLEY For the love of all that 's human , Jess , do you realize that you 're taking a stand against your husband in favour of a dumb animal ? p. 68 JESSIE HURLEY ( in the same way as former speech ) . He may be dumb , but he 's not deaf . He hears every word you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor little heart , too . ( Mutters this next line . ) Look at that , little tears in his eyes . ( Hugs dog . ) You ca n't tell me that he does n't know what 's going on . JIM HURLEY ( stands looking at her for a moment , as she cuddles dog . He loses control of himself altogether and starts for door L.I . As he goes ) . Oh , for Gawd 's sake ! ( As he grabs for knob of door . ) JESSIE HURLEY ( turns quickly ) . Where are you going ? JIM HURLEY I 'm going out to get drunk . ( He exits hurriedly , leaving the door open . ) ( JESSIE rises , standing dead C. without any movement whatsoever , screams at the top of her voice . The first scream is a short one . She gets no response , so she screams again , and the second scream is a real shriek of anger . ) ( On the third shriek JIM re-enters . He is white with rage . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bring the neighbours in here ? ( Without moving , JESSIE screams again . He rushes to her . ) Stop that , do you hear ! People 'll think I 'm murdering you . p. 69 JESSIE HURLEY ( wailing now , paces floor up and down stage L.C. ) . You ca n't do this to me . I wo n't let you do this to me . JIM HURLEY ( L.C. ) . Do what to you ? JESSIE HURLEY Make rules and regulations for me . JIM HURLEY They 're not for you . They 're for that damned dog . JESSIE HURLEY ( angrily ) . Do n't you call him a damned dog . He 's not a damned dog . ( Goes to couch and sits . To dog as she is going . ) Do n't you mind him , Cyclone . Do n't you listen to a word he says . ( Cuddling the dog . ) I think it 's going to faint . JIM HURLEY ( starting for door again , then stopping ) . Oh , what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . If you go out that door , Jim Hurley , I 'll go to that window and scream at the top of my voice . ( Rushes to window C. ) JIM HURLEY ( looks at her for a moment , but weakens and comes to back of table L.C. ) . All right . You win . You win this time , but from now on  --  watch out . ( He is worked up with anger , and almost hisses this last line. ) p. 70 JESSIE HURLEY ( coming to him R.C. ) . Watch out for what ? JIM HURLEY ( extreme anger now ) . Never mind . JESSIE HURLEY ( nervously ) . I suppose you 're going to make another attempt to steal my dog ? JIM HURLEY Your dog ? JESSIE HURLEY Yes , my dog . It used to be our dog , but it 's my dog , now . ( Sitting in chair R. of couch R. ) JIM HURLEY ( coming R.C. ) . If it comes right down to brass tacks , the dog belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what ? A pound . ( This contemptuously . ) JIM HURLEY That would n't make any difference if it was for a shilling . ( Up to window . ) JESSIE HURLEY Well , you give her back her old pound . If you do n't I 'll go and give it back to her myself . JIM HURLEY ( coming over to her again ) . You 'd better stay away from her , if you want to keep out of trouble . That woman can throw us both in jail , do you know that ? We stole that dog from her , and in the eyes of the law we 're a couple of dog thieves . ( Goes to above table L. ) p. 71 JESSIE HURLEY ( sniffling ) . You stop trying to frighten me like this . JIM HURLEY ( going to her ) . I 'm not trying to frighten you . It 's a fact .

JIM HURLEY Then they 'll ring in the morning . JESSIE HURLEY We can move in the morning . JIM HURLEY Move where ? JESSIE HURLEY Anywhere . I 'm willing to go to Spain . JIM HURLEY Spain on what ? JESSIE HURLEY On a boat . JIM HURLEY What boat ? JESSIE HURLEY ( absolutely hysterical now ) . I do n't know the names of the boats . What do you ask me all these silly questions for ?

JIM HURLEY What did she say when she missed the dog ? p. 76 JOSEPH MEADOWS Became hysterical . She 's still at my house under the care of Doctor Hearn . JIM HURLEY ( laughs ) . That 's good , that is . JOSEPH MEADOWS What 's the joke ? JIM HURLEY ( still giggling , but it is forced ) . I 'm thinking of the doctor . He 's liable to turn into a dog specialist . JOSEPH MEADOWS They telephoned me at the Johnstons ' and I hurried home . I was flabbergasted when I found out what had happened . Of course , I did n't even know that she had a dog . She explained where she got it . Crandall said you folks had walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I knew  --  it was the same dog . JIM HURLEY You can imagine how I felt . I was thunderstruck when she walked in  --  and she raved over the dog worse than my wife ever did . JOSEPH MEADOWS She 's still raving . Said she never loved anything so much in her life . Ca n't pacify her at all . She 's in a frightful condition . JIM HURLEY ( nods head toward door up L.C. ) . My wife 's in there scared to death . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( looks at door ) . Really ? Oh , that 's a shame . p. 77 JIM HURLEY Well , I just told her the truth . That the dog is no longer our property . That we 're liable to arrest for what we 've done . ( Takes a few steps L. ) JOSEPH MEADOWS ( lightly ) . Oh , no . Nothing like that . Do n't be foolish . ( Crossing over to him . ) I 'll tell you why I came here . ( One hand on HURLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie straight . ) I want you and your wife , if you will , to do me a favour . You see , I 've explained everything to Miss Webster , just as it happened . But she seems to doubt the story . Now , I thought if you folks would be good enough to come to my house with me , that she 'd immediately recognize you as the man who sold the dog , and she 'd know then that I 've told her the truth . ( Crossing away to L. ) I 'm almost sure that if the four of us sat down and had a little talk , everything would be all right . Would you mind doing that ? JIM HURLEY ( shaking his head  --  does n't like the idea ) . Well , I do n't know , Mr. Meadows . I think the best way , now that you 're here , is for you to take the dog back and give it to her . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( smiling at the idea ) . Oh , now do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . But right 's right , Mr. Meadows , and we 're in the wrong . ( Telephone rings . ) ( As he moves to phone . ) Excuse me . ( In phone . ) Hallo ! Who ? Mr. Meadows ? Yes , just a second . ( To MEADOWS . ) Someone calling you . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( as JIM has moved to phone , MEADOWS has taken his position above table L. ) . Calling me what ? Well , give me the phone , Hurley  --  Hurley , Hurley , you 've given it me in the wrong hand . Oh , it 's all sticky . Nasty phone , this . ( Lays his hat on table L. and coat over the back of chair L. of table L. Goes to phone . In phone . ) ( During MEADOWS ' conversation over the phone , JESSIE has opened the door up L.C. and stands listening . JIM , who has moved away to L.C. , tries to wave her out , but she refuses to go . ) Hallo ! Yes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really ? How long ago ? I see. Oh , that 's too bad. Well , it ca n't be helped now. All right. All right , Doctor. Yes , I shall I 'll manage it some way. All right , Doctor , thanks. Bye-bye ! ( Hangs up . To JIM . ) She got the address from the doctor and she 's on her way here . p. 79 JIM HURLEY Miss Webster ? ( JESSIE at this point slams the door shut , and both characters turn and look quickly . ) Just a moment . ( Dashes up to door with fury . ) ( As he reaches door , checks himself and very quietly opens door and exits , closing the door quietly behind him . ) ( MEADOWS watches him off , then starts pacing floor , talking to himself . ) JOSEPH MEADOWS He 's not going to switch this animal over to me . No , sir , not in my home . Not after what I 've seen . JESSIE HURLEY ( shouting from within ) . No , I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to him at all . They 're not going to take my dog away from me . No one in this world is going to take my dog away from me . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( smiles as he stands still close to door up L. and listens to this . Murmurs as he crosses away to R. ) . Good girl ! That 's the stuff ! JESSIE HURLEY ( shouting again from within ) . Well , you give her back her pound . And get that man out of this house . ( Short pause . ) I 'll shout as loud as I like . I 'll start screaming in a minute if you do n't get out of this room . You get out of here , do you hear me , Jim Hurley ? p. 80 JIM HURLEY ( re-enters ) . All right , all right , all right . ( Speaking back into room before closing door . He moves down stage and looks at MEADOWS . ) That gives you an idea of what I 'm up against . JOSEPH MEADOWS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talked to her JIM HURLEY No , do n't you risk it . ( The door buzzer rings . The two characters look toward door . ) ( To MEADOWS , nodding at door . ) You think so ? JOSEPH MEADOWS ( significantly ) . I 'm afraid so . ( Door buzzer rings again . ) ( JIM goes over to door down L. and opens it . ) ( LYDIA is standing in the doorway , very excited and out of breath . ) JIM HURLEY How do you do ? LYDIA WEBSTER ( as she enters , to JIM ) . So ! You sell dogs and steal them back ! Is that the business you 're in ? ( JIM , who is above door , turns to MEADOWS . ) ( LYDIA crosses below JIM , and above table to C. , confronting MEADOWS . ) LYDIA WEBSTER ( C. ) . What did this man say ? What excuse does he offer ? Where 's my dog ? p. 81 JOSEPH MEADOWS ( R.C. ) . Take it easy , Lydia . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. Emphatically ) . I want my dog . JESSIE HURLEY ( pounding on the outside of door up L. ) . Get those people out of this house , Jim Hurley . Get them out , do you hear me ? ( All three characters turn and look toward door up L. ) LYDIA WEBSTER ( to MEADOWS ) . That 's the woman you told me of , I suppose ? ( She starts for door up L.C. ) JOSEPH MEADOWS ( following her up  --  is on her L. ) . , Lydia , please ! LYDIA WEBSTER ( tries knob and finds door locked . Knocks on door ) . Open this door . Open it instantly ! JESSIE HURLEY ( within ) . You get away from that door . Get out of this house ! LYDIA WEBSTER ( turning to JIM , who is on her L. ) . She has the dog in there , I suppose ? ( JIM nods emphatically . ) ( To JIM . ) I demand you open this door . p. 82 JOSEPH MEADOWS ( up to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LYDIA WEBSTER ( ignores MEADOWS and speaks to JIM ) . You tell that woman I want my dog . Tell her the dog belongs to me . JIM HURLEY I 've already told her that . LYDIA WEBSTER Then you admit that you sold me the dog ? JIM HURLEY Yes . LYDIA WEBSTER And then turned round and stole it back . JOSEPH MEADOWS Lydia , dear , you already know the facts of this case . We went all over that . Now , be reasonable . LYDIA WEBSTER ( still ignoring him , and speaking to JIM ) . Are you going to give me my dog , or shall I send for the police ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Please , Lydia ! You 'll be a nervous wreck . LYDIA WEBSTER ( turning on MEADOWS ) . Why did you run off and leave me ? JOSEPH MEADOWS ( C. ) . Because I wanted to work it out my own way . LYDIA WEBSTER ( C. to L. ) . I 'll work it out in my own way . ( To JIM . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know at once . p. 83 JIM HURLEY ( L. ) . Just a minute . ( Goes up to door . Tries knob . ) Unlock the door , Jess . I want to come in . JESSIE HURLEY ( inside ) . You get those people out of the house . You give that woman back her pound and get them out , do you hear ? JIM HURLEY ( rattles knob again and calls through door ) . Come on , Jess , darling  --  angel ! I want to tell you something confidentially . JESSIE HURLEY ( inside ) . I shall not unlock this door until those people are out of the house . LYDIA WEBSTER ( determinedly . She goes to chair below door L.1 and sits down , showing that she means business ) . And I 'll not leave this house till I get my dog . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( who has moved away to R. Coming to C. ) . Lydia ! For Heaven 's sake ! ( JIM starts for door L.1 , but is stopped by LYDIA . ) LYDIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door ) . Where are you going ? JIM HURLEY Downstairs and around and try to get there through the back way . p. 84 LYDIA WEBSTER Oh , no . You do n't come any of those tricks on me . You 're not going to leave here till I get my dog . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( annoyed ) . You 're making a fool of yourself , Lydia . LYDIA WEBSTER Oh , no , I 'm not , and I do n't intend that these people shall make a fool of me , either . JIM HURLEY I 'm not trying to make a fool of anybody . I want you to have the dog . That 's all I 've got to say . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( picking this up very quickly . To JIM ) . Well , I 've got something to say , and I do n't want her to have the dog . Now , what do you think of that ? LYDIA WEBSTER ( glaring at MEADOWS on this and taking a step to above table L.C. To MEADOWS ) . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. ) . Now , do n't go into a tantrum . I said it , and I mean it . I do n't want you to have the dog . LYDIA WEBSTER Are you serious ? JOSEPH MEADOWS I most certainly am . LYDIA WEBSTER ( goes to him R.C. ) . Why do n't you want me to have the dog ? p. 85 JOSEPH MEADOWS Because I do n't want any pet dogs in my house . LYDIA WEBSTER Your house ? JOSEPH MEADOWS ( qualifies it ) . Well then , our house . My house will be your house from now on . LYDIA WEBSTER ( emphatically facing away to front ) . Not without the dog . JOSEPH MEADOWS Do n't say that , Lydia . LYDIA WEBSTER ( seating herself in chair R. of table L. ) . I 've said it , and what 's more , I see through it all very plainly now . This is a trick , a conspiracy . You 're in league with these people . This has all been arranged , and probably by you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the man who sold it , hid him in your home with his female accomplice , and by subterfuge you manipulated matters so that I 'd come there and you 'd have them steal the dog the moment I 'd turned my back . I suspected as much from the moment you started to tell me that cock-and-bull story of how you met these people and of your fight with this man . It all came to me in a flash . That was my reason for following you here , because I felt you were lying . I 'm convinced now . ( Rising . ) You 're jealous  --  jealous of a poor little Pekinese . You knew it would make me happy . You do n't want me to be happy . You 're like all men . Self-centred , selfish . It was all very well planned , but not clever enough to hoodwink me . I 've caught you properly . Do you dare look me in the eye and tell me that I have n't ? Humph ! ( Swings from him and goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. ) p. 86 JOSEPH MEADOWS ( shakes head with almost a touch of pity . To JIM ) . What do you think of that , Mr. Hurley ? JIM HURLEY ( who has been standing above table L. , smiles ) . Perfect . My wife is an also ran . ( Moving up C. ) JOSEPH MEADOWS ( now losing his patience with LYDIA , and coming to above table L. ) . Lydia , I do n't care what you accuse me of . But I must ask you to apologize to Mr. and Mrs. Hurley . LYDIA WEBSTER I 'll apologize to Mr. and Mrs. Nobody . JOSEPH MEADOWS Then you really believe the whole thing was a plot ? LYDIA WEBSTER I 'm sure of it . JOSEPH MEADOWS Why , the price you paid for the dog alone should convince you that LYDIA WEBSTER ( interrupting ) . The price means nothing . He got his money . I want the dog . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( over to JIM , who is up stage C. ) . Hurley , Hurley ! Return the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snaps fingers and holds out hand ) . Come on !

LYDIA WEBSTER What for ? JOSEPH MEADOWS The dog . LYDIA WEBSTER ( defiantly ) . I would n't sell that dog for a million pounds now . My mind is quite made up . JIM HURLEY ( smiles , and takes note from MEADOWS ' hand ) . There you are . I told you it was no use . I told you it was no use . ( Moving away up C. again , showing relief and satisfaction as he re-pockets money . ) JOSEPH MEADOWS ( after a look at JIM , turning to LYDIA  --  with authority ) . Now , see here , Lydia . I 've held my temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assert myself . I forbid you to carry this foolishness any farther . p. 88 LYDIA WEBSTER ( rising  --  highly indignant ) . Who are you that you dare forbid me anything ? By what right do you challenge me ? JOSEPH MEADOWS The right of your intended husband . LYDIA WEBSTER It is n't what I intended . It 's what I intend . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( picks this up quickly ) . And what do you intend ? LYDIA WEBSTER ( crossing MEADOWS below table to JIM , who is standing C. to R. ) . To get that dog before I leave this house . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( coming to above table ) . Very well , you 've taken your stand . Now I take mine . You make your choice . It 's the dog or me . LYDIA WEBSTER ( quickly ) . The dog .

JOSEPH MEADOWS I would n't call him an enemy . JESSIE HURLEY ( vindictively ) . He punched you in the eye , did n't he ? JIM HURLEY Shut up , Jess . KELLOG ( after taking a look at others  --  to MEADOWS ) . Is that right ? Did this fellow punch you in the eye ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Well , that 's a long story , constable . LYDIA WEBSTER Yes , a very long story , and I do n't believe there 's a word of truth in it . It was all trumped up to steal my dog . JESSIE HURLEY ( jumping up and speaking . To LYDIA ) . It 's not your dog . Do n't you dare call him your dog . ( Sitting down again . ) KELLOG ( impatiently again ) . Come on , come on , come on , come on ! Let me do the talking . Let me do the talking . ( To LYDIA . ) You claim the dog is yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JESSIE , rising and starting to explain . ) KELLOG Sit down , the pair of you . p. 104 JESSIE HURLEY Listen , officer , she KELLOG ( turns to her ) . Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! ( LYDIA and JESSIE sit down again . ) ( To JESSIE , in a different tone ) . How do you claim the dog ? JESSIE HURLEY The dog was stolen from me . KELLOG ( to JESSIE ) . She stole the dog from you ? ( Indicating LYDIA . ) JESSIE HURLEY No . He did . ( Pointing to JIM . ) KELLOG ( taking a look at JIM  --  to JIM ) . What did you do with it ? JIM HURLEY I sold it to her . ( Pointing to LYDIA . ) KELLOG ( turning to LYDIA ) . Is that right ? LYDIA WEBSTER Yes , and the dog was stolen from me . KELLOG Who stole it from you ? LYDIA WEBSTER ( pointing to JESSIE ) . She did . KELLOG ( quite confused ) . I see . ( Rubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) And then you stole it from her , I suppose ? p. 105 JOSEPH MEADOWS Do I look like a man who steals dogs ? LYDIA WEBSTER ( with bitterness ) . No , but you hire others to do it for you . JOSEPH MEADOWS Lydia ! KELLOG Come on , come on , come on ! ( Looking at all of them out of the corner of his eye . ) Let me get this thing straight . ( To JIM . ) You stole the dog from her . ( Indicating JESSIE . To LYDIA . ) You bought the dog from him . ( Indicating JIM . Again to LYDIA , pointing at JESSIE . ) She stole the dog from you . ( To MEADOWS , pointing at JIM . ) And he punched you in the eye . Is that right ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Well , there 's many an angle to this controversy KELLOG Angle ! ( Getting very angry now . ) You do n't say ? Well , I 'll give you a piece of news . I 've heard all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing look and going over to phone on table R. , speaking in phone . ) Hallo ! Say , my lad , send that porter up here again. The porter. This is the constable that was called in. Yes. Hurry him up . ( Hanging up receiver and giving them all another knowing look . Taking stage C. ) Now listen , either you people are trying to put it across me or there 's something going on here that you 're trying to cover up . p. 106 JOSEPH MEADOWS I 'll give you a very satisfactory explanation if you 'll listen . KELLOG I have listened and it 's the rottenest explanation I ever heard . What did this woman mean  --  that you hire other blokes to steal dogs ? JOSEPH MEADOWS She does n't know what she 's saying . LYDIA WEBSTER Oh , yes , I do . JOSEPH MEADOWS No , you do n't . LYDIA WEBSTER Yes , I do . JOSEPH MEADOWS No , you do n't ; no , you do n't . Your mother said you never knew what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEADOWS an angry look ) . What was your reason for punching him in the eye ? ( No reply . ) ( Repeats . ) I 'm asking you ! What was your reason for punching him in the eye ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Go on , tell him . JIM HURLEY ( after pause ) . He interfered with me and my wife . KELLOG ( grasping the reason . To JIM ) . Oh ! ( Then turning to MEADOWS . ) So , you were foolin ' around with his wife , was that it ? p. 107 JOSEPH MEADOWS ( indignantly ) . Most certainly not . LYDIA WEBSTER ( to MEADOWS ) . Well , you took her to your house and put her to bed ! You told me that yourself . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( giving LYDIA an angry look ) . Lydia ! KELLOG ( coming over to JESSIE and addressing her ) . Is that right  --  were you at his house ? JESSIE HURLEY My husband knows all about that . KELLOG ( to JIM , with a wise look ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JIM HURLEY ( rising and losing control of himself  --  to KELLOG ) . Hey ! Wait a minute . Do n't you say things like that . KELLOG ( quickly and firmly ) . Sit down ! Do n't you try and bluff me , my lad ! JOSEPH MEADOWS ( to KELLOG ) . Well , you be careful what you say . KELLOG ( turning again to MEADOWS ) . Now listen , I did n't like you the first squint I took at you . ( MEADOWS rising with indignation . ) Now , sit down before I go through with what 's in my mind . Do you get me ? ( Shouts . ) Sit down , both of you ! ( MEADOWS sits first , then JIM follows suit , but takes his time about it. ) p. 108 JIM HURLEY ( sulking as he sits ) . Do n't accuse me of conniving . KELLOG ( angrily to JIM ) . That 's enough from you . ( Takes another look at them all again . ) Humph ! I thought there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . The stuff I heard downstairs didn't-sound right to me at all . ( Suggesting that he 's not quite sure of himself as to whether he 's been kidded or not . ) JIM HURLEY ( dead sure at KELLOG ) . No . KELLOG No . JIM HURLEY No . You 're Sherlock Holmes , the big four and the flying squad all rolled into one , are n't you ? KELLOG ( giving him a nasty look for a second  --  then going over behind sofa to JIM with contempt , leaning over him ) . Say , listen to me , my lad  --  listen to me , I 've got a uniform on ! ( Door buzzer rings . ) ( KELLOG checks himself and slowly starts to turn . All look at door . JESSIE has risen the moment KELLOG has gone over to JIM , and as KELLOG is leaning over JIM , JESSIE is leaning over KELLOG . As KELLOG turns he confronts JESSIE  --  face to face . ) Sit down ! ( JESSIE sits quickly on couch . As KELLOG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a contemptuous look and getting up and starting to walk to C. KELLOG turns and JESSIE quickly steps back and sits in chair L. of couch . ) ( The PORTER knocks on door down L. ) ( KELLOG goes to undo the door down L. , speaking as he goes. ) p. 109 KELLOG I 'll find out what I was called in for . ( He unlocks door R.1 . Opens it . ) GEORGE ( as door opens , GEORGE leans in doorway ) . Did you send for me ? KELLOG Yes . Come in here , my lad . ( GEORGE enters and stands below door . KELLOG closes door but does n't lock it this time . ) ( To GEORGE , as KELLOG takes his position C. to L. above table L. ) What do you know about these people ? Who are they ? GEORGE ( points to JIM ) . That man and his wife live here . I never saw the other two before . KELLOG I see . And why was I called in ? What 's it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing is a joke . These people have just been kiddin ' , that 's all . KELLOG ( with surprise and sarcasm ) . Oh ! Just kiddin ' , eh ? GEORGE Just kiddin ' . KELLOG ( getting sore now ) . Well ! What do you think of that ? Just kiddin ' ! ( As he is taking stage C. ) And I was called in just because they was kiddin ' ? ( No reply . ) ( He scratches his chin , and circles round and up stage , then back into C. position . ) I suppose this dog stuff you were pulling was just to get a rise out of me and amuse yourselves , was that it ? Kiddin ' the cop , eh ? Well , that 's a great way to spend the evening . ( To GEORGE , who is at door R.1 . ) My lad , go in that room and see if there is a dog there . If there is , bring it out here . p. 110 GEORGE ( as he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room up L. ) KELLOG ( standing up C. angrily , his eyes all over the place ) . And I do n't mind telling you , if I find out that there is n't any dog here at all , what I 'll do to you flock of birds 'll be plenty . You 're looking at an officer that is n't going to be made an Aunt Sally of  --  not by a bunch of cream puffs like you . JOSEPH MEADOWS ( to KELLOG ) . It is n't necessary to be insulting . KELLOG ( to MEADOWS ) . Now , look here , I keep liking you less all the time . ( At this point GEORGE appears with dog in his arms and brings his words with him . ) GEORGE ( as he comes to KELLOG C. ) . I never knew before that this was a dog . I always thought it was a squirrel . KELLOG ( looking at dog ) . Oh , it 's one of them Park Lane bloodhounds , eh ? ( To others . ) Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you produced some kind of a dog . I 'll tell you that . ( To GEORGE . ) Let 's take a peek at the Pekinese . ( Taking dog . ) What 's the matter , Button-face , are you scared to death ? Humph ! My wife 's been wanting one of these dogs for a long time . ( Nervous movement from women on this . ) ( To dog . ) Hallo there , Foolish-face ! p. 111 JESSIE HURLEY His name is not Foolish-face . KELLOG No ! What is his name ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Cyclone . KELLOG ( pause  --  then to MEADOWS ) . One more comic remark from you and you 're for it . I asked you a civil question . What 's the dog 's name ? JIM HURLEY He answered your question . The dog 's name is Cyclone . JOSEPH MEADOWS It was born in a storm . KELLOG ( a cunning look again at both men ) . Say , you 're having a hell of a time with me , ai n't you ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my own . ( To GEORGE . ) Here , my lad , hold this fish for a minute . ( Hands him dog . ) I 'll make you stop in pretty quick time . ( Goes to phone . In phone . ) Hallo ! Listen , sonny , get me Regent six-four-three-four and ring here as soon as they 're on the phone . Go on , and look smart . ( Hangs up . ) JIM HURLEY What are you going to do ? KELLOG ( as he is coming to C. ) . You 've had so much fun riding me , I 'm going to give you a little ride in return . p. 112 JOSEPH MEADOWS What 's the charge ? KELLOG Disturbing the peace and refusing proper information to an officer of the law . LYDIA WEBSTER You need n't call a patrol . My car 's downstairs . Plenty of room for all of us . KELLOG You do n't seem to mind the trip . LYDIA WEBSTER On the contrary , I shall be very glad to tell my story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JIM HURLEY Keep quiet , Jess . What 's the matter with you ? KELLOG ( looking at her for a second ) . That 's all right , my girl . Scream your head off . Cough it up . We 're all out for a wild time . ( Very much amused at this , laughs to himself , then turns to LYDIA . ) So that 's your Sunbeam downstairs , is it ? LYDIA WEBSTER ( contemptuously ) . It 's not a Sunbeam . It 's a Rolls . KELLOG ( to LYDIA ) . A Rolls , eh ? Well , what do you think of that ? ( To MEADOWS . ) So you pinch motor-cars too , do you ? I thought maybe you specialized in dogs . LYDIA WEBSTER ( indignantly ) . What do you imply ? p. 113 JOSEPH MEADOWS ( seriously now ) . See here , Constable . You 're making a great mistake . ( Giving him his card . ) That 's who I am . KELLOG Yes . ( Reading card . ) Joseph W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at MEADOWS . ) The bankers and brokers ? ( Pause . ) JOSEPH MEADOWS Precisely . KELLOG ( with a wise look at MEADOWS ) . Well , what do you think of that ? Mr. Meadows , eh ? Well , I 'm certainly glad to meet you , Mr. Meadows . ( After giving him another wise look , then turning to JIM . ) And you , too , Mr. Swan . JIM HURLEY Where do you get that Mr. Swan stuff ? KELLOG Well , you 're Mr. Swan , ai n't you , of Swan and Edgar ? This is Mr. Meadows , of Brooks , Mann and Meadows . ( Indicates MEADOWS  --  broad smile now . Glances at the two women , then to MEADOWS . ) Who are the two gals  --  Rothschild 's nieces ? And I suppose this is Rin Tin Tin ? ( Pointing to the dog . ) ( All characters glare at KELLOG with utter disdain . ) ( He turns on MEADOWS suddenly , almost viciously . ) What do you think I am ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding head and smiling , after he has punched again . ) Do n't keep on doing that . Where 'd you steal this card ? p. 114 JOSEPH MEADOWS I have other credentials if you doubt me . KELLOG Yeah ? Well , you need n't waste time showing ' em me . You can slip ' em to the Inspector at the desk . ( Phone rings . He goes to phone , grabs it . In phone . ) Hallo ! Who is this , Arthur ? Give me the desk , Arthur . ( Looks at MEADOWS . ) Mr. Joseph W. Meadows  --  well , what do you think of that ? ( Snickers to himself . ) Kiddin ' the cop , eh ? ( In phone . ) Hallo ! Yes , hallo , this is Kellog . JOSEPH MEADOWS Kellog ! Kellog ! Did you ever hear such a name ? KELLOG Reporting off post. Block of flats King 's Road I do n't know yet ( Looks at all characters . ) Looks like a round-up . ( Movement from all characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sergeant ? I think I ought to handle this myself , Sergeant. No there 's a big car here. Yes. That 's just what I was going to suggest. Sergeant right. ( Hangs up . Goes to GEORGE C. Reaches for dog . ) Give me that dog . ( To GEORGE . ) Run ahead , downstairs , and tell that driver to pull up in front of the door  --  got me ? p. 115 GEORGE ( with surprise ) . You do n't really mean it ? KELLOG Go on , do as I tell you . GEORGE Right , sir . ( GEORGE exits door down L. , leaving door open . ) KELLOG ( holding the C. of stage as he starts giving orders . To LYDIA ) . Now , if you do n't mind , we 're going to accept your invitation for that joy-ride , Miss Rothschild . JIM HURLEY ( gets up and quickly over to KELLOG ) . Look here , what are you going to do ? KELLOG ( snapping at him quickly ) . Another word from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get over there and line up , go on , go on , get over there . JIM HURLEY Over where ? KELLOG ( indicating the door down L. ) . Over there . ( JIM gives him a hard look and takes his position at door down L. , going above table . ) ( To LYDIA , who is in chair at L. of table L. ) You too , come on , hurry up . Get over there and line up . ( LYDIA gets up , gives KELLOG a sneering look , and takes her place next to JIM at door . ) ( To JESSIE , who is in chair R. of couch . ) Come on , please . ( JESSIE rises slowly . ) A little speed ! ( JESSIE gets up and gives KELLOG an angry look , goes in front of KELLOG to take her place next to LYDIA . ) ( To MEADOWS , who is in chair R. of table L. ) Come on , hop into it , Mr. Wheatfield. p. 116 JOSEPH MEADOWS ( as he is getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOSEPH MEADOWS ( takes his hat off table L.  --  repeats ) . Meadows . ( Now takes his coat from back of chair in which he had been sitting and is taking his place above table next to JESSIE . ) KELLOG Oh , yes . I knew it was a vacant lot of some kind . ( All are in line ready to go when KELLOG gives the word . ) JOSEPH MEADOWS ( turning to KELLOG ) . I 'll report you for this . KELLOG Ah , shut up ! ( This whole scene is played with all seriousness and business-like manner from the time KELLOG starts to give the order to line up . ) Now listen . So we all understand each other . When I give the tip-off to go , I want you all to go right out of that door , straight through the hall , down the stairs , out on to the pavement and into that car . Keep looking straight ahead all the time . JOSEPH MEADOWS You ca n't do a thing like this . KELLOG ( snapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' it , ai n't I ? Go on , go on ! ( They all start out through door R.1 E. ) Kiddin ' the copper , eh ! ( They march out , making exit door down L. ) @x The Lounge Hall in the Websters ' House . A handsome oak-panelled set broken up by many angles . An entrance is down L. and another down R. Up stage on the R. in the angle is a door leading to the billiard-room , and in the angle on the L. above fireplace , which is L.C. , is a door leading to the servants ' quarters . L.C. in front of fireplace , with its face front , is a large couch . A table is set behind it upon which is the telephone . On the R. is a library table with arm-chairs on either side of it . A window is up stage C. , a chair by it on the R. An arm-chair is above and to R. of fireplace , and a cabinet on L. of same . A carpet covers all the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At rise of CURTAIN , MR . WEBSTER enters from R. with newspaper , goes to fireplace , looks at clock , then to above table R.C. , takes match out of match-holder and as he is lighting cigar , murmurs to himself . ) MR . WEBSTER Well , it certainly is a great world  --  a great world ! ( MRS . WEBSTER enters from R. , comes into room C. , glances at WEBSTER and starts pacing floor by going down to L. below couch , then back to C. and up to window C. , looks out and comes back to L.C. She shows by the clasping and wringing of her hands , and shaking of her head , etc. , extreme nervousness . It is apparent that she is on edge , and undergoing a great mental strain . ) ( WEBSTER has glanced at his wife once or twice , also showing annoyance and impatience before speaking . ) I left the other room , dear , on account of you pacing up and down that floor . p. 119 MRS . WEBSTER ( continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get over the disgrace of it all . MR . WEBSTER ( going down and sitting on arm of chair L. of table R. ) . Where 's the disgrace ? Twenty years ago , yes , but not in this age . Men and women have come to realize that if they ca n't agree , it 's a great deal better to find it out before marriage than after. Why , engagements are broken every day in the week , now . MRS . WEBSTER ( sits on arm-chair C. above fireplace ) . Perhaps , but for no such nonsensical reason as a disagreement over a pet dog . We 'll be the laughing-stock of the town if this leaks out . MR . WEBSTER ( impatiently ) . Oh , rot ! MRS . WEBSTER We are now for that matter . Why , that piece in the paper yesterday MR . WEBSTER ( with a wave of his hands , as he is reading the paper ) . That piece in the paper yesterday was written by some little two-penny-halfpenny police reporter . MRS . WEBSTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for everyone to see . ( Rising and moving down to below couch L. ) Why , the description of the scene at the police station was the most mortifying thing I ever read . ( Paces up to window C. and down stage again. ) p. 120 MR . WEBSTER ( now sitting in chair at L. of table R. ) . But it was all about the Hurley woman . It was she who did all the wild screaming and carrying on . The paper stated very plainly that Lydia was within her rights and that the dog was awarded to her because legally it was her property . Hurley admitted that himself . MRS . WEBSTER ( sitting on couch L. ) . Oh , but it 's all so cheap and vulgar . MR . WEBSTER What is , sticking up for one 's rights ? ( MRS . WEBSTER gives him an indignant look . ) ( Rising and pacing the floor to above table R. and back to couch . Sitting again . ) Well , that 's all Lydia 's done . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . But if you ask me , I think Joe Meadows is more to blame than she . He tried to force her into giving up the dog . She 's a strong-minded girl and her spirit of independence would n't permit of such a thing . That 's all there is to it . It 's his fault if the engagement 's actually broken off . ( Rising from his chair and knocking the ash from his cigar at table R. ) MRS . WEBSTER A man certainly has the right to assert himself to the woman he 's engaged to . MR . WEBSTER ( now standing at R.C. ) . Yes , but not to act the tyrant . There is n't a woman in the world who does n't have to be humoured now and then . Do you suppose you and I could have sailed along these twenty-seven years , if I had n't given in to a thousand and one of your little whims and fancies ? p. 121 MRS . WEBSTER ( rising and coming C. to L. to WEBSTER  --  indignantly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( firmly ) . Yes , and you hear what I 'm saying , too . MRS . WEBSTER ( resenting this ) . Well , will you please tell me , did you ever MR . WEBSTER ( interrupting ) . We wo n't discuss that now if you do n't mind , Caroline . MRS . WEBSTER ( still very angry , resuming her seat on couch ) . Well , of all the absurd statements MR . WEBSTER ( as he goes to sit in chair L. of table R. Again interrupting ) . There 's nothing in the world could ever induce me to take sides against my own daughter , as you 're doing . MRS . WEBSTER You know very well that Lydia has made a perfect fool of herself over this dog . MR . WEBSTER The dog is n't the real issue at all now . Her object is to prove to him that she has a mind of her own , and I admire the stand she 's taken . It 's big . Proves that she 's her father 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without my individualistic ideas ? p. 122 MRS . WEBSTER There 's a vast difference between individualism and downright obstinacy . MR . WEBSTER I 'm not so sure of that . MRS . WEBSTER So you mean to say bringing this Hurley woman into the house as the dog 's companion meets with your approval ? MR . WEBSTER It certainly does . As Lydia said herself , she fully intended to engage some girl to take charge of the dog . The position was open , so why not give the preference to Mrs. Hurley ? The woman was grief-stricken . I think Lydia deserves a world of credit for working it out that way . MRS . WEBSTER ( shaking her head hopelessly , as she moves up C. ) . You 're as incorrigible as the girl herself . MR . WEBSTER ( rising and meeting her C. ) . I wish you would n't say that , Caroline . We 'd be unnatural parents if we failed to take part at this stage of the proceedings . Now come , Caroline , I know best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he takes her arm . ) After all , she 's our little girl . Am I right ? MRS . WEBSTER ( weakens , but reluctantly ) . I suppose so , dear . MR . WEBSTER ( smiles ) . You know I am . ( Patting her hand . ) Now , I 'll tell you what we 'll do ( At this point the outer door is heard to slam and LYDIA 'S voice is heard in hallway . WEBSTER moves down to below table R. and MRS . WEBSTER remains C. , both looking off L. ) p. 123 LYDIA WEBSTER ( outside ) . It 's all right , Hurley , do n't bother . I 'll carry the little darling . Mamma Lydia 's got him safe and sound in her arms , has n't she , Cyclone ? Yes , of course she has . ( This last part is spoken as she enters ; baby talk to the dog , as she comes brightly into the room , followed by JESSIE in nurse 's costume . ) Did it have a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful park , and did it see all the great big trees and the lovely green grass and everything ? Yes , of course it did . ( By now has reached C. and meets her mother . ) ( JESSIE is up near the door L. ) ( To her mother . ) Hallo , Mummy ! ( Kisses her  --  then crosses to her father below table R. ) Hallo , Dad ! ( Kisses him . ) MR . WEBSTER Hallo , dear ! LYDIA WEBSTER ( turning to her mother ) . Oh , Mummy ! Oh , you missed a glorious drive . You should have been with us . We went right along the river . ( To HURLEY , who is in background up L.C. ) Did n't we , Hurley ? JESSIE HURLEY ( in very much servant fashion ) . Yes , miss . p. 124 LYDIA WEBSTER We only made one stop . That was in Bushey Park , to give Cyclone a chance to romp and roll around in the grass . You should have seen the dear little thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides ached , did n't we , Hurley ? JESSIE HURLEY ( coldly ) . Yes , miss . LYDIA WEBSTER ( brightly as possible . To dog  --  baby talk ) . And the poor little thing just did n't seem to know what it was all about , and he did n't care , either , did he , just so long as he was out in the beautiful sunshine in the great big beautiful car . ( Crossing to L.C. Baby talk to dog as she is crossing . ) His Mamma Lydia never took her eyes off him for the whole blessed trip . Did she , little darling ? ( Cuddles dog . ) MRS . WEBSTER ( who has been watching the situation by glancing at WEBSTER , then at LYDIA , then at JESSIE , has stood all she can ) . My God ! ( MRS . WEBSTER turns and exits R. ) LYDIA WEBSTER ( on hearing her mother , turns and , as her mother exits , looks with surprise ; then to her father ) . What 's wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WEBSTER She 's a bit irritable , dear . We 've been talking . LYDIA WEBSTER Oh , still harping on the reconciliation , I presume ? MR . WEBSTER In a way , yes , but I think , however , that LYDIA WEBSTER ( interrupting ) . I 've got a lot to tell you , Dad . ( Turning up to HURLEY and going to her . ) Here , Hurley . Take Cyclone , I want to talk to dad . JESSIE HURLEY ( taking CYCLONE ) . Yes , miss . ( Starts talking baby talk to dog . ) ( JESSIE exits off R. ) ( LYDIA watches JESSIE off R. , then comes down to chair L. of table R. WEBSTER has also crossed stage to L. and sat on couch . LYDIA is taking off her wrap and hat and is placing them on chair L. of table R. as she speaks . ) LYDIA WEBSTER Listen , Dad . The first thing I did this afternoon was to drive down town to Joe 's office . MR . WEBSTER ( seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( taking off gloves ) . No , but I left a package with his secretary , to be given to him as soon as he returned . p. 126 MR . WEBSTER A package ? LYDIA WEBSTER ( moving over to him by couch on his R. ) Yes . The ruby bracelet . MR . WEBSTER You 've really broken the engagement ? LYDIA WEBSTER Why , Dad , we 'd be perfectly miserable as man and wife unless we had a thorough understanding now . MR . WEBSTER Well , then I 'm afraid that that 's the end , Lydia . He 's as strong willed as you are . LYDIA WEBSTER ( sitting on her father 's R. on couch ) . Exactly . So I daresay it 's best for all concerned . Why , here 's a fair example right here . From all this Hurley girl has told me , her life with her husband has been one long series of battles from the very beginning . MR . WEBSTER Has he made any attempt to get her back home ? LYDIA WEBSTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone again last night . Simply begged of her to come back . MR . WEBSTER Could n't budge her , eh ? LYDIA WEBSTER ( shakes head negatively ) . Dad , her devotion to that little dog is the most beautiful thing I 've ever seen . ( EDWARD has entered from L. on part of LYDIA 'S last speech. ) p. 127 EDWARD ( at L. ) . Mr. Meadows has called . ( WEBSTER and LYDIA look at each other . ) ( Repeats . ) Mr. Meadows . MR . WEBSTER ( after getting nod from LYDIA ) . Show him in , Edward . ( EDWARD exits L. ) LYDIA WEBSTER ( jumps up quickly , crosses , and as she is getting her wraps from chair L. of table R. ) . I do n't want to see him . MR . WEBSTER ( rising , and going to C. ) . You need n't . LYDIA WEBSTER ( glances off up towards the L. entrance ) . Careful what you say , Dad . MR . WEBSTER ( waving her away ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( At the same time MEADOWS comes breezily into the room , followed by EDWARD , who goes to L. and exits , leaving door open . ) JOSEPH MEADOWS ( to WEBSTER , who is at R.C. ) . Hallo , Governor ! MR . WEBSTER Hallo , Joe ! p. 128 JOSEPH MEADOWS Lydia 's home , is n't she ? MR . WEBSTER Yes . JOSEPH MEADOWS I 'm not asking to see her , but I do want to return this . ( Offers small jewel case to WEBSTER . ) She left it at the office this afternoon . It was designed to please her . Wo n't you ask her , please , to keep it , and not to hurt me in this way ? MR . WEBSTER ( taking box and putting it inside coat pocket ) . Well , I 'll do all I can , Joe , of course . ( Confidentially . ) But , you know , a lot depends on yourself . ( Glancing off R. , so as not to be heard  --  to MEADOWS . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't weaken . JOSEPH MEADOWS Yes , Governor , I remember everything you said . I 'm not here to plead for myself , but I do feel a sense of responsibility for the Hurleys ' separation . The poor fellow 's a gloomy wreck . You 'd understand if you could see him sitting in the car outside right now , the picture of utter despondency . MR . WEBSTER ( surprised ) . He 's outside , in the car ? JOSEPH MEADOWS Yes , I brought him along in hopes that I might arrange an interview . Do you suppose it 's possible for me to see Mrs. Hurley ? p. 129 MR . WEBSTER I think so , yes .
