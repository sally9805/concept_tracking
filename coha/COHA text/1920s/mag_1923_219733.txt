William Jennings Bryan , speaking before the West Virginia State Legislature in a campaign for anti-evolution legislation similar to that recently defeated in Kentucky , said : " You need not punish these teachers of evolution . Men who believe they have the blood of brutes in their veins will never be martyrs for any cause . " In a dispassionate and authoritative article in the New Republic , Vernon Kellogg , biologist , and Permanent Secretary of the National Research Council , summarized the present status of organic evolution . Quotations : " I do not know of a single living biologist of high repute-and I do not determine repute on a required basis of a belief in evolution ! - who does not believe in evolution as a proved part of scientific knowledge . " The evidence from . . . these fields ( comparative anatomy , embryology , paleontology , geographical distribution ) ... is over-whelming . " Though a unit on the fact of evolution , scientists frankly admit their ignorance of its causes . Lamarck 's , Darwin 's , Mendel 's theories are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the antievolutionists , let them make the most of it ! We can afford to be honest . "
