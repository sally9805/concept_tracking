MOSQUITOES-William Faulkner-Boni &; Liveright ( $2.50 ) . A dozen mosquitoes gather on a yacht in southern waters . The mosquitoes are : unctuous Mrs. Maurier , queen mosquito , owner of the yacht , collector of eccentric celebrities ; over-mannered Mr. Talliaferro , who carries a malaria germ of artistic small talk ; Jennie and Pete , lower order of flies-by-night invited on the party by Patricia , a young mosquito who , none the less , administers the most powerful sting . Other insects-an author , a smalltime poet with a dull buzz , a sculptor-swarm drowsily in the lethargic air . Love affairs , talk , small business , occupy their time until they all go home again to New Orleans . <P> Written in the mood , somewhat in the setting of South Wind ( sophisticated classic by Norman Douglas ) this book has some of its characteristics-a sharp satire , a style of suave surprises . But through its pages blows not a strong and pungent sirocco ; instead a slow and tepid wind in which insects may hover lazily . Author Faulkner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verge of an important irony which he never produces . His second novel is a step up in technique , a step down in importance from his powerful Soldiers ' Pay ,
