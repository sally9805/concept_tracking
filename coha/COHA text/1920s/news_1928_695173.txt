txt The " Old Gray Mare Band " of Brownwood , Texas , and another musical aggregation started the night session of the Democratic National Convention ' off with a duel of melody . The delegates were slow in assembling and the galleries and other spaces set aside for visitors were even slower in filling than were those of the delegations . A violent thunder shower had cleared the air somewhat and tempered the heat . The rain was continuing when the crowd began to gather in the hall . Huge fan holes in the roof let the rain through and some of the delegations received a wetting , as did some of the 500 newspaper correspondents covering the convention . A soloist made an attempt to sing , but it was all lost in the hum of conversation and the surge of incoming delegates and visitors through the aisles . A little courtesy applause followed the venture at vocal music , but it was half-hearted . Even music becomes stagnant when launched on the heat-laden air in the Sam Houston Hall . When the hands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the time fixed for the night session to begin , the spaces set aside for visitors were about half filled and the delegates appeared to be pretty well on hand . Shaver 's Last Appearance . The huge klieg lights that spread a silvery shimmer through the immense auditorium began to flicker , but steadied themselves as Clem Shaver , Chairman of the National Committee , emerged to call the night session to order a little later . This will be his last public appearance in his role as National Chairman . John W. Davis , four years ago the Presidential nominee of the party , ; ot into Sam Houston Hall and into his seat in. the space set aside for the New York delegation without arousing any attention or any applause at all . To reach the seat he occupied he had traversed the centre aisle for two-thirds the length of the hall . It was 7:50 when Mr. Shaver began to bang his gavel in a wholly ineffective manner . Finally it became a tattoo and the convention began to take notice . It was almost 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rev. William States , pastor ' of the First Presbyterian Church in Houston , who looks quite a bit like Senator Borah , then delivered a prayer . More gavel - work after the prayer was ended and then a secretary with iron lungs came forward and enjoineil silence . Claude G. Bowers of New York was then nominated for Temporary Chairman and Charles A. Greathouse of Indiana ; Secretary of the National Committee , nominated for Temporary Secretary . A long list of feminine Vice Presidents was then put in nomination , followed by a list of other functionaries from parliamentarian to doorkeeper . They were all elected by viva voce vote and then the keynote orator was escorted to the rostrum , where Chairman Shaver surrendered the gavel to him . Keynoter Frequently Cheered . Mr. Bowers was heartily cheered . He made a hit at the very start by declaring that the Democratic Party was pledged to the fight against plutocracy and pillage . This phrase pleased the crowd and the audience cheered . A moment later the delegates and spectators again cheered as the speaker denounced the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech as he referred to the Democratic Party as the party of Jefferson , Jackson , Cleveland and Wilson . Again his auditors interrupted Mr. Bowers as he asserted that Harry Sinclair had paid the Republican Party 's debt . This reference to the oil scandal made a hit with the audience , and they showed their appreciation with a prolonged cheer . Mr. Bowers 's comparison of the political philosophies of Jefferson and Hamilton was listened to with close attention , but there were comparatively few opportunities for applause in this part of his speech . Mr. Bowers struck a militant note which found ready response from his hearers when he declared that the Democratic Party must fight with the Jeffersonian method , the Jacksonian. sword and the Wilsonian spirit . Mr. Bowers kept his auditors roused to a high pitch of enthusiasm by his repeated references to the scandals disclosed during the two last Republican administrations . There was a great burst of cheering when he declared that the record of the eight years of the Wilson Administration was " like a flood of glorious sunshine against the smutty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Acclaim the Name of Wilson . The first big moment of the convention came when Mr. Bowers mentioned the name of Woodrow Wilson . At the sound of the name of the last Democratic President . delegates , alternates and spectators rose and cheered wildly . It was a spontaneous demonstration with real sentiment behind it . The audience showed almost continuous approval of the speech . They laughed at his mention of the " little green house in K Street , " in which Mr. Bowers humorously added , " there were sounds of revelry by night . " Those in the hall liked best those parts of Mr. Bowers 's speech which attacked Republicans . They sat with smiling faces as he charged corruption in nearly every department of the Federal Government during the period immediately preceding President Coolidge 's Administration , and his assertion that Secretary of the Treasury Mellon and a little group who could be crowded into the directors ' room of the Alumimim Trust controlled the Government . His denial that there was such a thing as " Coolidge prosperity " among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He received cheers for his denunciation of President Coolidge 's veto of the bill while he at the same time favored the tariffprivileged classes and signed a bill creating a revolving fund for favored shipping interests . A real demonstration began when Mr. Bowers shouted : " We demand that the hand of privilege be taken out of the farmers ' pocket and ' off the farmers ' throat . " received money sent in a " little black bag . " Discussing the naval leases , he said there was no one in the Cabinet to " blow a police whistle . " Secretary Hoover was in the Cabinet and President Coolidge was Vice President , sitting frequently with the Cabinet at that time . Stirs Laughter on Hoover . Mr. Bowers launched a dart at Secretary Hoover when he said that the latter , when he received a letter of complaint had sent it to Albert Fall , then Secretary of the Interior . Mr. Bowers quoted Mr. Hoover as having said in a notation on the letter : " I should be glad to send any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearers caught the allusion and there was general laughter . The delegates and spectators were equally quick to catch the allusion to President Coolidge when in discussing the oil leases , Mr. Bowers said : " Sometimes I think that the virtue of silence may be overdone . " Chairman Bowers in pursuing his denunciation of the oil scandals without mentioning names made reference to Will H. Hays , late Chairman of the Republican National Committee , " laying aside his saintly function of a deacon of the church to go to Sinclair , getting the tainted bonds and transferring them to the campaign coffers of his party . The convention appreciated this slam at the former Republican National Chairman and roared its approval of the attack . Mr. Bowers said that the prosperity boasted by the Republicans was not there . " You can not judge the prosperity of a people by the prosperity of a privileged minority , " he said . He declared that 4,000,000 jobless and an abundance of commercial failures belied the Republican claims of prosperity . Predicts Democratic Victory . Mr. Bowers said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old landmarks of liberty and justice . He predicted a Democratic victory . " We shall win , " he said , " because our cause is just . " The convention arose to its feet and stood in the steady shimmer of the kleig lights , again turned on , cheering and applauding for a minute or more when he finished after an hour of his high-voltage oratory . Mr. Bowers after finishing his speech called the convention to order at 9:10 , and recognized Justus S. Wardell of California , who offered a motion that resolutions introduced in the convention should go to the Committee on Resolutions and Platform without debate . On motion of Senator Swanson of Virginia the convention adopted the rules of the House of Representatives . On motion of J. Henry Goeke of Ohio , the Secretary called the roll of States , the Chairman of each delegation announcing the members from that State of the various convention committees , the Vice Chairman of the convention and the members of the National Committee . This was a formality , as the delegations in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention . Announcement was then made that various standing committees of the convention would meet at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning . The Resolutions Committee will meet and hold its hearings in the auditorium of the Public Library . On motion of , former Representative John J. Fitzgerald of Brooklyn the convention then adjourned until 11 o'clock tomorrow morning . An Impressive Spectacle . By the time Mr. Bowers began his speech the huge auditorium had filled up . It presented an impressive spectacle with the floor , comparable in size with Madison Square Garden , the amphitheatre tiers of seats rising from base to the ceiling , filled with men and women who only awaited a. cue from the keynote orator to respond with cheers and applause . With the convention on its feet cheering , the banner of North Dakota , erstwhile home of the NonPartisan League , which typified an agricultural revolt in the first instance , began to stir . It was raised from its anchorage and borne out into the aisle , where it began to move forward toward the rostrum . Kentucky first , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrations which follow the nomination of a candidate . Soon the banners of half the States , and by degrees all of them , were being borne through the aisles , while the band was playing and the delegates were cheering . Southern States were prompt in responding to the sentiment expressed by Temporary Chairman Bowers , as were States which can not be classed as agricultural . Nebraska , South Dakota , North Carolina and Kansas were among the early participants . Mississippi , Indiana , Washington , Utah , West Virginia , Alabama , Texas , District of Columbia , Michigan , Nevada , Rhode Island , Wisconsin , Oklahoma , Idaho , Wyoming and Maryland were in the procession before it had moved half way across the hall . New York came next , and that was the signal for the banner of every other State to be up and moving . " We will send Herbert Hoover back to England , where he came from , " shoutea a delegate from Oklahoma , who was the proud banner bearer of his delegation in the procession . Bowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then there was a hush to permit Chairman Bowers to resume his castigation of the Federal Government under Republican control on account of its treatment of the farmers . More applause followed his plea for fair treatment for agriculture and his denial that the Democratic Party was or had been the enemy of business . During the demonstration a Kansas woman on the platform pinned a sunflower , emblem of this farm State , on Mr. Bowers 's coat lapel . The capacity of the audience for enthusiasm had been exhausted temporarily and comparatively mild applause followed renewed attacks by Mr. - Bowers on the Republican Party for alleged misdeeds , and his charge that Republican officials had " framed " a charge against a Democratic United States Senator , a reference to the effort of the Department of Justice a few years ago to charge crime against Senator Burton K. Wheeler . He warmed the audience up again by more references to the oil scandal and a charge that a member of the Cabinet had been implicated and.had            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
