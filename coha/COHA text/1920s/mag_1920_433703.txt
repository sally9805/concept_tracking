PARENTS who have a boy always disclose the fact with a smile , or in a tone of gratification . Then usually there follows the assurance that he is a ' real boy , too . ' Though you might think him noisy and untidy , bent upon his own concerns , and a great tease , rather rough and inconsiderate , yet , for themselves , they do not mind : they like boys . Boys will be boys , and a real boy is the real thing . You meet this ' real boy , ' too , in all books about boys . You even seem to see him constantly on the street and in your neighbor 's yard , or trespassing on your own land . You unquestioningly believe schools to be full of him , and your office-boy perhaps appears to be a sample of him . But among boys whom you really know , which one is really such a boy ? Is your well-beloved nephew that kind of a real boy , or the boys you know well among your pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , or you yourself ? Scarcely . Yet , if this is not the real boy , what is a boy , really ? What are boys like ? Here are hundreds of them passing before us , swiftly , vigorously moving from babyhood to manhood . What definite things do we really know about them ? and if they are not like what we think they are like , why do we think they are like that , and not like what they really are like ? Our habitual assumptions about boys are pretty definite . They have a positive reputation . During the past ten years , I have been collecting what is currently said and constantly written about boys , noting and jotting down each familiar phrase as I happened across it . Putting them all together , I get a popular characterization which runs thus ( everyone will recognize how common the ideas are ) : ? Boys are noisy and decidedly in need of physical activity , for they possess an inexhaustible supply of surplus energy . Boys are dreadfully untidy , very inconsiderate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Boys are pugnacious and athletic , yet they are lazy . To lessons they are indifferent , to it , as well as to disgust and fear ; they spend much of their time dodging their duties , deceiving those in authority , and teasing those beneath them . Boys love so to rule that they are superlatively resistive and rebellious . They are full of creativity , because of which they devote themselves to keen interests , one at a time , with the passion of collector and specialist . At the same time , they are very emulative , and so responsive to competition , that two young boys together are scarcely safe in a dangerous place where either one alone would be perfectly trustworthy , and three together are sure to get into trouble . Indeed , they have such an inclination to show off , that they thus speedily take leave of their common sense when they gather in groups ; but they hate to be shown off by others . In truth , boys have so great a desire to excel , that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become president ; this gives them a high standard in whatever they undertake ; so , if they think they can not reach that standard , they refuse to try at all . Indeed , when you come to know them , you find boys supersensitive and very dependent on sympathy and comprehension , highly objective and very dramatic , and not at all self-cognizant . They are built in compartments , and a real boy can not see one part of himself when another is engaging his attention . Everyone must recognize that this concatenation of contradictory claims and charges , heterogeneous as it is , includes after all only what is currently know do not categorically answer to this description , though we recognize that each is like some part of it . Our own lads are sons and brothers and human souls ; each is a person , different from all others that ever were . The characteristics which all boys have in common seem to us so few as to be almost negligible , and even these few appear in separate boys in very varying degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common that men do not also have ; and most of what makes boy and man is common in girls and women , too . Boy ' probably pointed out originally nothing but the mere fact that a man is young before he is old . There is , we all know , very little which distinguishes a boy from a man , except his youth ? that is , his obviousness in interests , his inexperience , and his inexpertness . In thinking of boys , we are thinking of men , minus responsibilities and skill . Your own boy at twelve or fourteen is as much a full-grown man as Richard the Lion-Hearted ever was ( though not as great ) . He is able , or should be able , to maintain himself in the inanimate world and to handle simple personal relations with some good sense . The only difference between the boy and the man that he is to become is in self-use and in use of the world about him . Nevertheless , in the long ages since there was not even that difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulated in the mere boy , ? in boys as boys , ? somewhat separate from men . The word ' boy ' has a strong collective flavor of its own , and before we discard it as a mere label , I want to consider it in a different way . Instead of collecting what people say about boys , suppose we patiently watch many actual boys , regarding each as if he were our own son or brother , and moving our thoughts about so as to see the boy 's acts as he sees them himself , and so as to guess how he explains himself to himself ; and , in addition , to guess how much of invisible motive and impulse there is which he never explains or thinks of at all : thus we may win at last to understand how the whole conflicting conception of boy came about , and how popular assertions which seem most contradictory are really descriptions of the same traits from divers standpoints of comprehension and incomprehension . The heterogeneous scrap-heap of current notions can , in fact , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensible , continuous , and satisfactory whole . Pursuing the idea boy ' in this way is trying to detach a group from the great flood of life and to define it . This is almost a scientific pursuit . And so , as we set forth to capture that elusive quarry , a definition , let us be sure we know what sort of creature we expect to find in the end . ' In the sciences of Life , a group must be defined , not by its exclusive possession of certain characters but by its tendency to emphasize them ' ? this is sound doctrine and simplifies our search . We do not expect to discover what boys are that no one else is , but only what they emphasize as no one else emphasizes it . Thinking thus , about real boys , my mind runs back , perforce , to the imagined beginning that we all know somuch about . Back there in the Tree and Cave , physical circumstances made the Boy-Man of earliest times inevitably the protector of wife and child , hearth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , from very long ago , his muscles and his temper have bred themselves to strength and pugnacity , activity and self-protection , through the dangers and difficulties of pursuit , struggle , and capture . Consequently , he has to-day , if he is healthy , and usually even if he is not , a natural love of physical activity ; and he possesses the abundant persistent energy made necessary to him by his position as progenitor and protector of the race . This is not to say that he has special toughness against disease , for he has not ; nor has he freedom from fatigue . Likewise , we know that his office as father put upon him the duty of dominance , self-confidence , and ingenuity after its importunate presence made vivid its demands . All this has no direct causal connection with the reproductive impulse . His character is simply the practical elaborate outcome of a responsible position which he took early in history , consequent , of course , upon his possessing the reproductive impulse , but not caused by it . That impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his activity ? a type marked by vigor and immediacy . It established a precedent for the sort of way in which his desire should work , through whichever part of his nature that spiritual force might ever and anon be active . So , through whatever channel a boy is working off his spirits , whether it be muscular , creative , or cogitative , he tends always to move with a sort of generative definiteness . He is subject to sudden overmastering impulses to action . Now it is hunger : hence raids on the pantry . Now it is muscular motion : hence trials of strength and the twisting of other boys ' arms . Always something doing . ' Always generative definiteness , even in doing nothing . This generative definiteness then is his characteristic emphasis : concentration , vividness , intensity , immediacy , exclusion , and selection are apt to control the manner of his activity , whether emotion and passion , steady practical occupation , or mere attention and mental process , be the matter of it . His historic business in life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to be bent upon his own purposes , and to strive to rule and to excel to the very utmost of his native capacity , so that he may preserve life and gain advantage , for himself and for those dependent upon him . Hence it is natural that he should often seem inconsiderate , unobservant , and insensitive , to bystanders who have not his attention and wish they had it ; who are not interested in his purpose and wish him to be interested in theirs . Such was the Boy-Man , by force of his personal circumstances ; but the primitive tribe wanted him to fit also the communal circumstances . It needed good fighters and loyal clansmen . So , side by side with the real boy , produced because his nature sought to answer its own immediate demands , there grew up an accepted type called a boy , which embodied the community-ideal of what a satisfactory boy must be . He must be against his enemies , brave ; and to his friends , good-hearted , generous , open , and loyal . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate lies to his confederates , meanness to his comrades , and all cowardice . He must be insensitive to fear , disgust , and pain , and also to the weakening claims of all the softer sentiments ? because he must be a good warrior and a stern enemy . I think that we all know enough of human nature to know that in such a primitive society , if any individual boy had not these virtues , he must assume them ; he must believe that he had them and make others believe it . Here arose a source of confusion . Internally , for himself and to himself , a boy was , first of ali , a conglomerate human creature , compact of innumerable capacities and perceptions , incapact. ties and obtusities . He could not by any amount of determination or self-deception be other than that particular individual bundle of traits which he happened to possess . He could not by any effort really conform to a type . The most he could do , of course , toward that imperative community demand was to assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do for the race as well as for himself was to develop his own traits , each to its best use , irrespective of whether he resembled in consequence any other boy or any ' accepted type . The early community demanded many more enthusiastic physical fighters than it naturally produced , so the rest of the boys must pretend to these warrior virtues if they could . If they positively could not , the monastery became at last open to them . What these non-fighters did in the earlier ancient days , when opportunities to be priests were comparatively few , it is hard to guess ( Perhaps fewer dreamers were born , since the need for them can have been so little felt . ) But absolute natural conformity to the demanded type was , of course , very rare . And so , from time immemorial , boys have pretended to be what they are not , as all persons do upon whom an unattainable expectation is laid . The pretence has not been conscious most of the time . They have fooled themselves , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations . So boys , personally self-wrapped and uncomprehending of others and of themselves , laugh at each other , traditionally and tribally , for showing personal feeling , special interest , or individual taste . They expect from each other acceptance of the group-demand . Often this is good . To most boys the expression of this community-ideal comes through the ' gang , ' and his gang , whatever it is , ? school , or scout troop , or merely his set , ? is rightly his world . The gang is indeed a boy 's larger self ; it makes possible for him achievements and joys that he could not compass alone ; though he often follows the gang merely because he is made uncomfortable if he does not , yet much of the time he follows it because it provides him with ideas and purposes which he lacks in himself . But even in the gang boys frequently heckle each other because each wants to feel superior to everyone else , and the easiest way to do that is to believe all others inferior , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each other 's ideas , and of being judged by the code . They dread to be thought queer and to be teased , and yet they have to be controlled . Most potent , most firm-bedded in each boy 's own nature is the wish to rule , himself anyway , others if possible . He feels strongly the determination not to submit , the instinct to follow his own purposes , to hitch to his own star , to achieve his own victory . Here is a curious and very real cross-rip ' between the wind of social demand and the tide of self-fulfilment . Threatened and compelled externally by the buffeting fear of pain or disgrace , and of scorn or laughter from his comrades , and at the same time urged internally by the irresistible current of his own self-directive tendencies , he finds himself in a parlous position , falsely interpreted by others and misinterpreting himself . He appears at once resistive and acquiescent , rebellious and gregarious . This is his position among his mates . Similarly , and for the same reasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is : ' I am inwardly urged to do as my ingenuity and interest prompt me . You must master me if I am to do differently . ' It never occurs naturally to him to look at what he does from any point of view but his own . He will accept naturally nothing that does not capture him ; he wants his own way , and if he must seem to submit , his first instinct is to dodge . The average careless boy , for instance , does not ask himself , ' Am I telling the truth ? Am I acting openly ? ' He asks , ' Am I protecting myself ? Am I defending myself or gaining my end ? ' We are so used to this , that we do not ask , ' Why ? ' and ' Is it well ? ' We merely smile or laugh or growl or sigh or reprove or scold or punish , and say , Is n't that just like a boy ! ' Lazy , inconsiderate , ingenious , and self-willed ! By this I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean the average boy in any big school . It is a common saying among teachers that boys are lazy , and among parents that they are self-willed , and ' old grads ' delight in telling the ingenious self-willed devices by which they used to do ' the teachers . So , from an ancient community-ideal embodying an imperative need , has arisen community misconception of what any given boy probably is ; and each individual boy , as he grows out of babyhood , meeting this misconception , faces it out as best he may . The art and manner of assuming to be a warrior when you are not is still handed on from father to son , and from big brother to little one , all of them tragically and ridiculously unconscious of the unnecessariness , in these days , in this country , of this dreary discom-fort fort from counter-blasts to which they are thus daily exposed . Boy learns from older boy a tradition which has ? been ceaselessly handed down from boy to boy since the time when men and boys were one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two simple primitive interests , if he thinks of life in terms of fighting and subduing , ? of conquerors and slaves , rivals and supporters , friends and enemies , ? he will behave accordingly . He will be self-absorbed , rough , and inconsiderate ; or he will be bold , generous , and loyal . Although self-assertion be contrary to his nature , nevertheless , when visitors to the new baby say to the elder brother , ' Your nose is out of joint , ' of course , he will grow jealous . He becomes ashamed of taking part where he can not excel , and so feigns indifference toward things in which he feels no superiority . From the boys just older than himself , and from men , he learns the time-honored bluffs ' by which he may create a surface of protection and gain an outward aspect of invincibility . If , being modest by nature , he thus becomes self-conscious , who has made . him so ? Certainly not the inanimate world ; certainly not himself . He is naturally as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grown folks believe they are eager to see the world-triumph of brotherly love , yet they talk about each other and talk to children as if the old conditions of tribal defense were in full control . No wonder that modest sensitive natures are wrenched , and learn to conceal and to deny their real selves . They do it all in self-defense against a community-expectation which has lost its usefulness in the more civilized groups and yet stands firm and unnoticed , a barrier to further progress . What we want in this modern democracy of ours is not more fighters or more blindly loyal followers , not even an increase of wise leaders : it is more able , cooperative , wide-seeing workers , each capable in his own line and ready to recognize and aid the capacity of others . Leaders are born , not made . So long as we keep our institutions and social customs plastic , natural leaders will rise to the places which need them . We have only to provide conditions by which all may become capable , willing co-workers ; from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not train leaders ; we can train useful , civ. ilized men . Our boys are ready and able now to become such men . But they do not get a fair chance , tradition so stands in their way . It raises this false expectation about them from the time they can turn over in their cribs , and it makes them take this false model for themselves as soon as they can understand a word . The false expectation is that they will be self-absorbed , and impervious to fine issues . The false model is the clan-defender . When I say I think our boys do not get a fair chance , I mean that our present way of meeting them as they come briskly along out of infancy , expecting our companionship , is stupidly inadequate and discourteous . Boys are not young savages , tough and intractable . As a matter of fact , most young boys whom we actually know , most of our own small sons and brothers , are supersensitive and most endearingly dependent upon sympathy and praise and comprehension from those about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to most distressing disgusts and repulsions , fears , and physical distresses . They are very demonstrative . Sentiment is dear to them , beauty is a keen delight , and they are eager to be worthy men and true gentlemen . Yet we incline to treat every little boy as though he knew not fear , pain , or shrinking of any sort , had no sensitive spots , and should be laughed at only to his advantage . If our boy shuns girls and babies , it is because he has been laughed at ; or because by them a prophetic feeling is roused in him for which he finds no immediate use ? so pervasive that it gives him an unpleasant sense of being mastered ? not of mastery . He feels baffled . Because this makes him uncomfortable , he calls it dislike of girls or babies . Just so he looks askance at sentiment and religion . And just so he believes that he dislikes singing and dancing and whatever else hints of a world which he does not understand . He is generally shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks and obtuse arrangements of his elders , instead of being helped along it by good fellowship and sincerity . Boys , in fact , are full of how many qualities ! It is boys who grow into the tender husbands and devoted fathers whom we know . It is boys who become poets and heroes , lovers , leaders , and creators . What a barbarism it is that their abundant pellucid natures should be tormented into rigid bounds or simply thrust into hiding . In most boys does not the stream of inner personality dive underground at about the age of eleven or twelve , and leave a more or less stony surface to the world ? It reappears , perhaps , in college with special college mates ; or not until marriage , when the husband learns to trust his wife 's sympathy ; or sometimes not even until fatherhood has given him the confiding trust of children . Or it actually waits , gloomy and distrustful , until the children have grown to an age of comradeship , and then the real beauty , humor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never reemerge , but the man goes on to the end , puzzled about himself , and misunderstood by everyone else . But more of an obstacle than common sense to inquisitiveness from us and to a lack of reserve in him is the blessed fact that he does not himself know what are his hopes and purposes , why he loves and how he is to create . He evades these thoughts , . instinctively seeking to live in the present and to avoid invasion by serious far-sighted persons . Boy or man , he frequently has no real notions or emotions . So he seldom knows the real reason why he does anything . What he is going to do and be , he knows even less . Much that he does he does instinctively , to conceal from us some feeling or thought which is too strong for him to understand . He is so very demonstrative that he early learns the absolute necessity for control . Of course , the pity of it is that , by poking fun at him , we stupidly drive him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a judicious and satisfying partial expression . In consequence of this tendency to live in the present and to be unaware of his inner self , a boy seems ordinarily to stay young a long time ; he never assumes a virtue until it has become necessary or desirable to him ; he waits to express himself till his knowledge shall have related itself to himself ; and he dislikes to display a power until he masters it . He is not really young , he is only inexpressive . He is growing inwardly , from the centre . Thought will show on the surface in due time . His mind is fixed on immediate purposes and projects , on prompt achievement , and on the masterful handling of his present opportunities , materials , and experiences . HO can , and he usually does with incredible success , shut off from his consciousness all side considerations , all surrounding circumstances , and obvious by-products of his line of thought or action . He can fail to see to right or left , but he sees straight on to the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least tries to see it and thinks he succeeds . So he can be amazingly blind to necessary by-products of his own course of reasoning . This makes him often seem incredibly selfish or stupid . To a boy , life is a succession of experiences . He himself is the centre of life . All things else are events of a drama , elements in a project , obstacles to a purpose , or aids to an achievement . How this , that , or the other action on his part will affect other people or even himself , inwardly , does not concern or occupy him , except as other people 's resulting action may affect his own results in the aim which he is just then pursuing . For this reason we find many chums , but few intimate friends , among boys . Very seldom , indeed , is a boy much interested in persons , and very little of his attention does he give to the significance of human relations : This sort of impersonality is equally characteristic of the most unselfish and of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician as truly as of the boy who becomes the social robber . A boy 's capacity for not knowing the personal affairs of his best friend is limitless . He is absorbed , not in persons but in pursuits ; for him , persons are , as it were , things , elements in his own problems . He senses neither other people as they might know themselves , nor himself as he might be known . That is not his affair . If he is interested in other people 's inward life , it is not for their sake , but to add to his own store of knowledge . So it comes about that we may call boys very impersonal . . But , in another sense , we ma . y call them very personal ; in the sense that they are interested in the whole universe only as it relates itself to their own personal interests . Surely , the fact is that a boy 's conscious life is intensive . I can but think that we do not half enough consider this in trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chances we give him for growth . What he ob . serves in any mood is a narrow portion of his total impressions ; hence his love of making what seem useless collections , and of getting up what seem irrelevant areas of information . ' If you want to know a thing , ask a boy . Ile will know all about it , ' or nothing . If he is interested , he is thoroughly interested . If not , not one whit . Watch a company of boys . Each is intent upon his own way of taking the matter ? even if it be the team-work for the home eleven . The eye of his mind is a dark lantern , the light of his intelligence falls in a straight shaft . His nature is built in separate compartments . This makes it possible for a half-baked boy to be sincerely devoted to his sister and yet tell ribald stories among his boy comrades ? in direct preparation for being a good husband and father , while he tolerates the existence of brothels , and laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , and because of this absorption of theirs in pursuits , not persons , boys are hard to invade and impress . And when we add to this lack of interest the positive impulse to self-rule and the generative quality of their impulses , it is no wonder that boys are not docile . It is no wonder that the question of discipline is ever present . IV Clearly they have to be impressed in some way other than by persuasion or expectation , request or admonition . It is fruitless to drag or drive a boy . Sometimes you can ride him , but generally the way to do is to get beside him and shove with him , so that he feels that you are as himself , pointing out the bad places in the road ahead . A boy can not see that an act is important until it becomes somehow a personal interest to him . Then he does it simply , with his whole soul . A real , capable boy will do a thing because he is interested or because he is compelled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for with a boy there must be either impulse from within or compulsion from without . The force must be strong . Whatever moves him must seem to him to be irresistible . Custom , the crowd , public opinion are compulsion enough for most boys , even quite contrary to their taste ; but one person 's wish is not ? unless a peculiar devotion happens to exist , and this can never be counted upon for next time . A new attraction may have intervened . While boys are still very young , under ten , they generally feel personal control to be as compulsion , and if it is strong , that is sufficient to direct them . Consequently , what they learn to believe with their heart in these years appears to them in the later years as a primary liking , a personal taste or a primal ordinance ; for they soon forget how they came by this prejudice and that predilection . Their native inhospitality toward unmastered experiences makes another reason for starting them young . Later , a boy resents personal control because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes hurt feelings when he breaks over ; but he likes law or military control because it makes authority impersonal and gives him a chance , if he sees fit , to outwit the rules of authority without hurting an individual . If he shuns preachments , it is because he feels that , if they merely bring conviction to his mind , they almost surely will not create sufficient force to make him wish to do the thing . They provide him with a chance to pretend , while they take away his hearty satis faction in looking upon the whole thing as a game between himself and the powers that be . Is not your boy , then , loyal ? Does he not joy to follow a beloved leader ? Yes ? but loyalty which is simpleminded and unquestioning belongs to earlier times . The boy of eight or ten corresponds to the loyal feudatory of the Middle Ages . Our boys of twelve or fourteen have their own independence to establish . A moving cause of acquiescence may at any time be affection or admiration ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he generally refuses the job ; he must believe that he does it because be is interested . Even conviction is but halfway compulsion . If he does it consciously for affection , he does it condescendingly as charity , or protestingly as nonsense , or pleasantly as a mere personal favor . It does not become a habit or take its place among his own preferences . And this is well . A boy who is led merely by his affections is a ' sissy , ' and a man or woman who by affection ' alone produces impulse in a boy weakens him . So a boy 's parents send him to boarding-school because they are assured that there he will be submitted to an impersonal process ; he will be put through a mill , as it were , and properly manufactured ; under compulsion , he will learn to conform to type . They can supply no such assurance at home . Whether the product produced is the best that could have been made of him , they are in no position to know . At all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong pressure . V Suppose your boy has been brought to the age of twelve or fourteen well developed , ? able , that is , to look after himself in the world , and grown-up according to pioneer standards , ? in very truth full-grown . He still has ten years of ' prolonged infancy ' ahead , before he can become a modem man , fit for the complex responsibilities of civilization , able , that is , to act upon principle , to apply a general principle to novel instances , and to see future advantage or invisible good so vividly that self-regulation is a matter of course . The last four of those ten years he will very probably spend in independence at college , under the formative influence of able men , public opinion , and a general atmosphere of intelligent thinking ; or he will go into business and come under steady control , and the necessity to do something useful . But what of the six earlier years ? are they productive as we now arrange them ? Just here is where I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two fundamental truths about a boy clearly are , that spiritually his action is always generative and that mentally his attention is toward pursuits , not persons . Rearranged by these clues , the heterogeneous scrap-heap of current notions ( which I collected in my opening paragraph ) becomes orderly and makes sense . A modern boy , born of civilized parents , we may define as a human being whose nature emphasizes , as none else emphasizes , activity , adventure , and conquest , with strong generative definiteness . And he differs specifically from a man in that he emphasizes activity and adventure above conquest ? the process above the result . From all of which it is plain to be seen that a boy needs for his best development , not only activity , but adventure ; not only adventure , but conquest ; and the more you permit him of true conquest , the more you make a man of him . His way of life should provide these three things for him in abundance . What form they should take would depend on the boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adventure to hear a symphony and a true conquest to play a Bach fugue correctly ; for a scientific boy , the ' adventure may be to pursue a new bird and the conquest to mount a perfect butterfly . But every boy has muscles and lungs which need the primitive joys and violent activities . He rejoices to wrestle with the elements , and to try his strength against the forces of nature ? among which forces are other boys , of course . We , the community , have taken from him one by one all the primitive activities upon which he was wont to expend all his surplus physical energy . Nowadays he must not fight except in self-defense . ' Corporal punishment , hunting , hazing , violent football , daily dangers , gaming , drinking , have all been removed ; fealty , partisan pride , rivalry , jealousy , mastery , tyranny , vaulting ambition ? all these we would taboo . This is not the establishment of civilized inhibitions ; this is stoppage . Fear , pain , and rage and fierce desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generators of force in men since man was . His proper job is to fight a good fight , and pit himself to win against something all the time . If the only obstacles which we offer are rules and masters , he will pit himself against those . It is the old , old instinct , the need to struggle and to overcome . ' Battle ' to him means strife , not carnage . Death and slaughter are mere accompaniments . It is not the blood and the devastation that he loves : it is the vivid conflict , with its visible risk and keen excitement . ' Fighting ' to him does not mean destruction . It means overcoming . It means the chance of conquest . Destruction seems merely a necessary incident , deplorable , but unavoidable . Nor does fighting necessarily mean enmity . Only our stupidity makes it carry that evil connotation . Boys must have danger , vigorous physical struggle , and quick result . If you have a little son who hates to hear tales of fighting , do you not feel an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking virility ? Fighting is not killing ; fighting is the hope of achievement . Adventure and invention are fighting ; so is the pursuit of an ideal , the struggle for a principle , and the capture of a truth ; all these involve fighting , and any private , personal victory brings more joy , though less glory , than a collective victory . Hence , in democracies , where each man is free to have a personal struggle throughout life , men care less and less for wars , and need them less . Fighting is here in the world to stay ? but it is a personal fight ; that is , each man wants to feel that he has done a good thing himself ; any triumph makes him equally glad . Peace must provide fights and physical activity . We in our community have sought to set aside fist-fighting and to discontinue the pain of corporal punishment , that the higher faculties may be developed ? toleration , sympathy , unselfishness , justice , and their mates . But ? here is a flaw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not therefore higher . Usually , because it is newer , it is weaker and more erring . At best , it is but additional ; not higher in itself , but making the whole higher . The high-grade man retains all his faculties , the primitive as well as the recent . Love of power , old though it be , still is , and forever will remain , the only releasing motive of human energy . If our own power is not sufficient , the next best joy is to behold the power of another and to lend our aid to his victory . So soon as the sense of power deserts us , and the possibility of achievement disappears , then life is stale , bitter , and useless ; hence the pathos of old age . 349 Therefore , in setting up any new community ideals we must give the superfluous energy of boys sufficient occupation to ensure them a sense of power , struggle and achievement . If that energy is simply checked , it will and does take annoying side-channels , because boys have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other generations have had independence , responsibility , and adventure ; they have been belligerent in their own way . They have battled with the elements , and tried their strength and cunning against the forces of nature . If we are providing nothing to take the place of such activities except organized athletics and supervised lessons , we must not yet expect a very satisfactory crop of better men . Games and lessons will not suffice . Such things provide no adequate struggle , no independence , no responsibility , or adventure ? only a harmless activity and a formal kind of conquest ; they all are good as far as they go , but ridiculously inadequate for young fellows who are really not children at all , but old enough to be their own masters ? if only modern life were not so complex . Of course , the fact that , for youth , every experience is new and is a discovery , does count for much . But it is not enough . We must get the accidental back into our boys ' life . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must give them something creative to fight for , and something actual to fight against , all the time . We must give them vigorous practical work to do in battling toward common purposes and worthy achievements . It must be a battlefield which aims to cooperate , aid , and construct for others as well as for one 's self . It is well for us to seek peace , that we may have room to work ; but the peace which we seek must not be placidity , or settled order . In it , the boys must use their strength to fight valiantly against all sorts of dangers and difficulties ? only not against people as enemies , that is all . Boys are chiefly interested in ' something doing . ' What they want to do will depend upon what they have learned to find desirable . What they want to fight will depend upon what they have learned to find hateful . They must have action . We elders are responsible for the ideals which prompt any special action . We begin early to mislead their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing at his mysterious , funny little baby brother , Are n't you jealous ? ' And to the fouryear-old , we say , ' Look , Johnny , can you do this ? You would n't let him do better than you , would you ? ' We ask who is the best in the class , and we call his fellows his ' rivals . ' In regard to every discussion , we talk of attack and defense . Ambition we make a wish to excel others , and competition a wish to destroy others . Verily , there is much vocabulary to be sloughed , and many stock ideas to be got rid of , before fathers and mothers can safely speak without thinking before their children . VI Ask yourself what gives you most trouble with the grown-up boys whom we call men , in committee work , in business relations , and in public service ? in fact , in any effort to work democratically , which is to say , cooperatively . It is not chiefly the incapacity of each man to see any point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not chiefly their incapacity , inexperience , or even credulity . It is jealousy ; it is rivalry ; it is treacherous and self-seeking suspicion . Self-importance , touchiness , exigence , fault-finding , the imputing of motives , and the unwillingness to act upon other people 's ideas , all these are signs of jealousy , and they come from the habit of fixing one 's mind on persons as rivals , ? on one 's self versus the others , instead of on the job . They are sadly fostered by the notion that , wherever two things or two persons are juxtaposed , one is best , and should be uppermost . In this country you can not impress upon your boy his life-opinions before he is ten ; but you can impress upon him an habitual expectation , that is , a conception of humanity , and a notion of his own relative attitude toward difficulties and toward persons . What parents say and do in the presence of their children can teach that . You can establish his motives , too . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cohesion reside in a nation just in proportion to the real democracy of feeling that is shown its boys and girls in the nursery and the school . Democracy knows that every man 's interest , rightly used , helps every other man 's , and that men are never natural enemies . In this country we all must fight , not enemies , but obstacles , and not so much against anything as for something . We must see what we want and struggle toward it  --  as does the whole creation . We want to raise our boys to be soldiers , and our boys all want to be soldiers . They are full of fight . We do not want them to spend their fine talents on the primitive vigors of fisticuffs and firearms . But we do want them to be brave soldiers of some sort , and even fighting in the trenches is better than no valor . What they will wish to fight against depends on their intellectual and physical constitution and their basic stock ideas , those cherished notions that they get into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions come largely from the community-ideal . Wherever that shifts in recognition that civilization is really possible , there a new demand grows up . And there a new conception of a satisfactory boy grows up to meet it . A civilized man is a highly artificial product . He is the result of purpose and determination . He does not appear by accident ; he is not a sport or a variation of species . A civilized man is not a pro-duet of nature at all . He comes by taking thought . He is laboriously produced by his own community . Wishing will not bring him . Only according as we deliberately give our boys a chance , will they become men of a new world . The more they are hemmed in by the visible ingenuities of other folks ' brains , the less chance have they for growth . Each invention is one man 's conquest , but another man 's barrier . Inventions have no civilizing power . Unless a boy can learn to jump them or use them to his own ends , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is behavior , and it springs from consciousness of values . It comes , not by growth , but by choice . VII Here then are our sons and our brothers , vivid , immediate , compelling . They have a right to growth and a need to be civilized . They are the pride of our hearts . Eager for mastery , keen for adventure and achievement , ready to devote themselves , in complete self-forgetfulness , to whatever has force to compel or impel them ? they like a thing better , the better it is , if only they apprehend it . They are very real boys ; no wonder their parents have pleasure in them , and no wonder we all rejoice in them . What are their fathers and mothers doing with them that suits their true natures ? What enlarging experience , what satisfying skill , what deep-lying interests does the community allow them ? Here are good material and sufficient force . At present , for six years after they have become equal to pioneer men , they are usually treated as children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate use should be found ? a use productive , creative , and friendly to self-expression , yet at the same time exciting , hazardous , and resistant , so that battles may be waged and strongholds lost and won with cheerful immediacy . War is as natural as earthquake . It should be a purifier and clarifier of hearts and purposes ; as it most surely is , where hearts and purposes are ready to go right . Fear , pain , and rage and fierce desire are good ; not spent in gusts and paroxysms , but used as power to gain some difficult good . Pursuit , struggle , and capture , danger , difficulty , and fatigue are good ; not to gain mean ends , but to make ideals real . These fervent heats are necessary to real life . Real boys must fight , and they must fight for something worth the vigorous conflict and the high endeavor.
