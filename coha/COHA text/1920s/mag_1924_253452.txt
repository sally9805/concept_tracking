At Rome , Pope Pius offered a medal to that one of the Catholic Women 's Diocesan Clubs that would evolve the most attractive modest fashion in women 's clothing . The Clubs had inaugurated a campaign against immodest dress . The Pontiff 's competition is divided into two parts : 1 ) a theoretic demonstration that immodest dress is silly , barbaric , uncultivated ; 2 ) actual dress designs . <P> ... <P> In Paris , La Semaine Religieuse , Catholic weekly , published general orders to the priesthood , advising refusal of the Holy Eucharist to women and girls in " decollete corsage or sleeves not covering the elbows . " Other Paris papers recalled a similar effort of Cardinal Dubois of Paris which resulted in a drop in church attendance . <P> ... <P> The Pope 's antifashion drive is to be assisted in the U. S. by the National Council of Catholic Women , the President of which is Mrs. Michael Gavin , daughter of the late James J. Hill , railroader.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
