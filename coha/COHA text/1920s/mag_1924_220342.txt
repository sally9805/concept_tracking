St. Louis has recently become the scene of a successful musical experiment . In a cup-shaped auditorium seating 10,000 , opera , grand or comic , has been given nightly . The principal singers and comedians are imported ; the choruses are local talent - St. Louis boys and maidens , trained throughout the Winter months . Velvet Summer twilights in St. Louis thrill to the strains of Verdi , Mascagni , Gilbert and Sullivan ; the moon , that vision of still music in the sky , looks down upon declamatory stars in tinsel and brocade . <P> Atlanta sent a scout , one C. B. Bidwell , over to find how it was done . On the first evening of his visit , rain deluged the city at seven o'clock . At eight , he went to the auditorium , found 5,000 people there , heard the light opera The Lilac Domino finely performed . The scout returned to Atlanta and reported to his chief , Asa G. Candler , Coca-Cola man . The latter was astounded by the revelations he received . <P> Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be an open-air auditorium , to hold mony as the inhabitants of St. Louis . A municipal opera is planned , with imported stars , local choruses ; there is to be an open-air auditorium , to hold 8,000.
