( See front cover ) <P> Over the rough and tangled places of the hemispheres trains of men with beasts of burden have forayed during the past winter , as often for sport and recreation as for science . Rich men have vied with institutions to explore , and have made the hardy trips themselves . To do so has become a new fashion . <P> WESTERN HEMISPHERE <P> In the west , outstanding expeditions of the season have been : <P> Maya Curse ( Field Museum of Chicago ) . In southwest Mexico , 35 miles south by southeast of Valladolid and at the western border of Quintana Roo , the Mason-Blodgett expedition sent by the Field Museum of Chicago came upon a highway built by ancient Mayans 40 feet wide and raised ten feet from the ground . <P> Except for trees which in 15 centuries have grown thickly upon it , the road was sufficiently smooth for motor driving . Directly in line with the recently discovered great causeway running southward from Coba past Lake Xkanha , this road seems part of a great Mayan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flight of stone steps going up a dilapidated pyramid 70 feet high . At its top Mayan priests had the habit of tearing the hearts from living human sacrifices , of offering the warm and bloody things to an idol , and of heaving the maimed bodies into a ravine close by . There seemed a fell malison on this spot which the Mason-Blodgett troupe had found . Their muleteers ran fearfully away , carrying with them the supplies . Gregory Mason , scribe , fell from the top of the pyramid and hurt himself ; he fell through the roof of a buried building and hurt himself more ; the tree which held his hammock also fell , almost on him . So the expedition paused for a while . <P> This gave them an opportunity to look over Cozumel , island off the coast of Yucatan , and to discover , in a cave at Ucul ( " hidden water " ) a shrine to the Mayan rain god , an excellently preserved little building whose stucco , after centuries of exposure , is still white . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temple of the Warriors " at Chichenitza , stupendous Mayan ruin in Yucatan , President John Campbell Merriam and Dr. Alfred Vincent Kidder of the Carnegie Institution watched amazed as Earl Morris , their associate on the expedition , scraped away the filth that for centuries had hidden a beautiful mosaic disc containing several hundred pieces of polished turquoise . It had been lying under the carved and painted Mayan altar discovered two years ago and is the " most artistic and elaborate of all known relics of Mayan civilization . "
