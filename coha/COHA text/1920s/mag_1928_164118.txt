Martine . A country girl who fell in love with a casual journalist and who married a yokel she did n't like when the journalist turned his attention to a brighter flame-that is what this quiet but very human little French play is about . But there is apparently some consequence of translation and transportation which leaves such plays weak . The American Laboratory Theatre presents this one with a cast that is clever but amateurish . <P> March Hares . In 1921 , this playfully preposterous comedy by Harry Wagstaff Gribble made two appearances on the Manhattan stage . Twice , with strenuous and pathetic spasms , like a fish in the grass , it flopped . There was a fairly unanimous feeling that the play would have lasted longer had it been played with more cunning and dexterity . When it became known that Richard Bird and Vivian Tobin were to appear in a second revival , theatregoers anticipated something that might brighten the last long week in Lent . <P> To some extent , their anticipations were rewarded . There was Geoffrey Wareham and Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a burden though a source of merriment to the girl 's bewildered mother . The situation in this little group became tense with the arrival of Claudia Kitts , friend to Janet , and foolish Edgar Fuller , Geoffrey 's visitor . Claudia looked at Geoffrey Wareham with timid but tenacious adoration . Squealing soulful come-ons , she caused a scene to occur wherein Geoffrey slapped Miss Rodney 's cheeks . Further complications were engendered when the pasty Mr. Fuller made a pass at Claudia . Not until her hitherto unmentioned husband arrives upon the scene , thereby precipitating one of the most comic lines of contemporary drama , does the demure insanity of March Hares become quieted in a final readjustment . <P> Though Author Gribble was said to have supervised the direction of the present production , many faults could be found in the manner of its production . The leading members of the cast sometimes flung their lines about with just such misplaced vigor as a hammer thrower might use in hurling a toy balloon ; they reached for comedy like a first baseman trying to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cunning , while Dorothy Stickney , who was a mad murderess in Chicago , brought down cheers for making Claudia Kitts as raucous as a finger nail dragged across a blackboard.
