C , " You have been nominated for the most important position in the world . Your great ability and your wide experience will enable you to serve our party and our country with marked distinction . I wish you all the success that your heart could desire . May God continue to bestow upon you the power to do your duty . " * Calvin Coolidge to Herbert Clark Hoover , via telegraph . <P> " The President and I send to you and yours our love and best wishes . " - Grace Goodhue Coolidge to Lou Henry Hoover , via telegraph . <P> Graciously , President Coolidge desired to accept a return consignment of goodwill brought from Mexico City to Washington by Captain Emilio Carranza , 20 , Mexican flying ace . Forced by fog to land at Mooresville , N. C. , in his Ryan monoplane , sister ship of the Spirit of St. Louis , Captain Carranza had refused nourishment , had mused : " I guess the people in Washington wo n't be so glad to see me now and my countrymen wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to provide nourishment and dispel unhappy fears by a public mark of favor . He asked Captain Carranza to lunch . <P> Unhappiness , lifted from Capt . Carranza , descended upon the White House housekeeper . Hours since had the kitchens been scoured , the house put in order for the summer . She faced the President , spoke the truth : " We have nothing in the ice box , sir . " A moment 's hesitation , and the President was master of the situation . Said he : " Very well , we will eat out . " They lunched at the Pan American Union building . <P> Delayed for two days because Mrs. Coolidge had been ill , the Coolidge Special rolled from Washington , D. C. , to Superior , Wis . It was a quiet trip . The President made no back-platform speeches . He did not turn on the radio to listen to the G. O. P. convention . <P> He left the train at Superior and was driven through the streets in the middle of a small parade of American Legionnaires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brule River , 35 miles away , shortly before noon . Mrs. Coolidge appeared at the lodge 40 minutes later , having stayed on the train until it reached a place called Winneboujou , in order to avoid a long automobile ride . <P> The President limped no more , * was in a frisky mood , jested with photographers and allowed them to snap him in several positions . " I brought them with me so I would n't be lonesome , " said he airily flicking his wrist . <P> Almost before anybody could say " Jack Robinson , " the President pulled out a fishing rod and was angling in Brule River from the bridge near the lodge . Then he went to Lake Nebagamon , several miles away ; but no one knew which fish he caught , if any . <P> Facing the problem of Sunday worship , President Coolidge had to make a choice . He might go four miles to the Presbyterian Church at Nebagamon , where expectant elders were viewing new and expensive decorations . Or , he might attend the tiny Congregational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshly trimmed at the staggering cost ( for a congregation of 30 ) of $800 . If he went to Brule , who should have the honor of preaching ? Should gray-haired , blind John Taylor , a mere layman , be allowed to fill the pulpit as usual ? Or should Brule call upon the Rev. B. Ernest Bayes , ordained pastor from big neighboring Superior ?
