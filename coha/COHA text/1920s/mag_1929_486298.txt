THE testimony of Owen D. Young on domestic and international communication facilities before the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce has just been front-page news , and deserved to be . Mr. Young 's words count in business and political circles on both sides of the Atlantic , indeed in all quarters where knowledge , intelligence , honesty , and public spirit matter . The chairman of the Radio Corporation of America came out boldly for monopoly of our air communications , both domestic and foreign , in the hands of a private company under government control , urging the consolidation of the communications division of the Radio Corporation of America , the International Telephone and Telegraph Company , and the cable lines of the Western Union , and advocating the merger of the domestic services of the Western Union and the Postal Telegraph Company on the ground that it would improve service and stimulate research . On the last point he voiced the highly heterodox view that research activities , which are expensive and speculative , would develop faster under monopoly than under competition . More surprising yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that blessed defense of whatever happens to be  --  he would be willing to go even that far if necessary to insure the unification of internal communication facilities . If there be any hesitation in creating a monopoly of external communications in the hands of a private company , he said , " then I beg of you in the national interest to unify them under government ownership so that America may not be left , in the external communication field , subject to the dictation and control of foreign companies and governments . " The national rivalry thus hinted by Mr. Young was brought out even more clearly by General Harbord : " At the present moment there is a race among the nations as to which can plant its flag first upon these radio channels by actual appropriation and use . " All nationalistic questions aside , Mr. Young 's doctrine comes surprisingly from the lips of one of the nation 's foremost business men . In communications , he declares , competition is ruinously wasteful and hinders technical progress ; if we can not get unification without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private operation would be better . Concerning competition in this large field , Mr. Young talks sense . At its best it is costly ; at its worst , intolerable . Mr. Young rightly wants planning and economy , not wasteful duplication , in communication facilities . Hence his sound plea for unification . But that means monopoly , and we are driven either to private monopoly under government regulation , or , if that fails , then inevitably to public operation . Such , insists Mr. Young , is our sole choice , and again we agree . Which , then , shall it be , a glorified Radio-International Telephone-Western Union monopoly company under a Federal Communications Commission , or a United States Communications Service like the United States Post Office ? Departing somewhat , as it seems to us , from the realism that marks his discussion up to this point , and relying more largely on conventional argument , Mr. Young declares for private ownership and operation because of its superiorefficiency , but insists that it must be accompanied by effective public regulation . Let us examine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public regulation necessary ? Plainly because under private monopoly the gains of efficiency are likely to go to the owners and not to the public , as we have seen again and again . Notwithstanding all protestations of " service , " the companies often gather in millions by exploiting the public instead of serving it . They have consequently a huge financial stake in defeating effective regulation . During the past half century , since we first began trying to regulate the railroads , at every step and with a large measure of success the private companies have fought effective regulation . They are fighting it today with all their enormous financial and legal resources . Surely Mr. Young is not unfamiliar with the record of the power companies during the years just past ; surely he does not imagine that they will consent to any legislation that seriously lessens their control over their customers . Pit a great private company with a huge direct financial stake against consumers most of whom have only small sums at issue , and nine times out of ten the company , in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for private monopoly plus effective regulation , however honestly intended , is in fact , we believe , a plea for private monopoly plus ineffective regulation . That , we submit , is intolerable , and we do not believe that the American people will tolerate it indefinitely . They may tolerate it for a good - while , however , because they will cling to the hope that Mr. Young and men like him hold out to them and because they are fearful of trusting serious economic tasks to their government . That distrust has abundant historical basis , but the record of private industry is not spotless , nor is that of government enterprise wholly bad . Even our much-berated federal government has not made a bad job of the Panama Canal , the Mississippi Barge Canal , or the Alaska Railroad , to choose only three instances . Many of the criticisms urged against government industry lie almost equally against large-scale private business , particularly of a monopoly character . The faults are largely the faults of bigness as such . Public business , by and large , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency is much less unfavorable than its critics make out . Government in the past has been largely an agency of repression and order , but today , even in capitalistic states , governments take on increasing economic responsibilities and in so doing change their character and function . We shall probably take Mr. Young 's advice , but we shall not learn the full lesson of his testimony until we have learned to perform these great economic tasks through our own agencies instead of turning them over to private individuals to carry on for their own profit . Private monopoly and public advantage , we believe , are fundamentally incompatible , no matter what regulating machinery we devise . In fields where unification is economically desirable , such as Mr. Young points out , we may accomplish some results in trying to reconcile private and public interests by regulation , but we shall reach in the end no solution short of actual government ownership . The Newsprint Scare T HE outburst of alarm on the part of members of the American Newspaper Publishers Association over a proposed increase of $5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been attended first by heat and then by light . For some weeks it had been rumored that the mills included in the Newsprint Institute of Canada intended to raise the price of newsprint from $55 to $60 per ton . The American publishers , frightened at the prospect of paying some $20,000,000 more a year for Canadian paper than they are now paying , and recalling , perhaps , that the International Paper Company , which is not a member of the Newsprint Institute , has a five-year contract with the Hearst interests at $55 , hurriedly got together at New York and listened to some sharp criticism of the provincial governments of Quebec and Ontario for their alleged attempt to fix prices and squeeze the American newspaper publishers . There were intimations that Premier Taschereau of Quebec and Premier Ferguson of Ontario had an eye to the politics of the situation , and somebody , of course , suggested that the Attorney General at ' Washington ought to be asked to do something . The newsprint industry is not exactly an infant , but it has had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada . Where the United States produced about 95 per cent of the domestic consumption of newsprint a few years ago , it is now producing only about 50 per cent . The American production , which in 1913 aggregated 1,305,000 short tons , reached its peak in 1926 with 1,678,000 tons , declining from that figure to 1,415,000 in 1928 . On the other hand Canada , which produced only 350,000 tons in 1913 , has increased its output every year since , until in 1928 it turned out 2,381,000 tons . For the first eleven months of the present year the Canadian production has reached 2,567,925 tons , against only 1,274,436 tons for the American mills . It is admitted that there has been overproduction , but an appreciable decline in Canadian stocks has been shown this year notwithstanding that Canadian mills are operating at only about 80 per cent of capacity . The price of $55 per ton was the result of a cut-throat . competition which forced down the price from a previous $70 to $75 per ton . Washington was prompt in letting it be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Canada unless it should appear that some American corporation was acting in cooperation with Canadian producers ; and the Newsprint Institute does not contain any American members . Moreover the International Paper Company of Canada , an American-owned subsidiary of the American corporation recently reorganized as the International Paper and Power Company , has not yet announced an increase in price . The attitude of the Canadian producers , too , took on a less aggressive and considerably more reasonable character after some explanations had been made . The manager of the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association , for example , pointed out that the governments of Ontario and Quebec had never interested themselves in price-fixing  --  a disclaimer which should have been unnecessary since the governments possess no such power . What they are con-cerned with is a distribution of tonnage that will keep one company or group of companies from running at full capacity while others run at only half capacity or less . The purpose of provincial regulation , Mr. Beck declared , was to insure that " no more wood shall be taken off in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , " and that communities dependent upon the paper industry shall not suffer through unemployment and trade dislocation : Premier Ferguson of Ontario called attention to the fact that the provincial government is a trustee administering the people 's property , and that the conditions imposed upon the corporations that cut pulp wood aim " to advance the settlement and development of the newer portions " of the province . We are not anxious to see $20,000,000 added to the cost of producing the annual crop of American newspapers , although we doubt whether , even so , a single important American daily would go out of business . But we are equally indisposed to back up hostile criticism of Canada for looking closely after the welfare of its own household . If the Canadians want to keep up the price of newsprint to a remunerative figure , they have only to point to the example of the Federal Farm Board in trying to keep up the price of wheat . As a matter of fact , a considerable offset to the announced raise could be found in the abolition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American newspapers affect . Perhaps , after the row is over , it will be found that Canada has actually supplemented Mr. Hoover 's efforts to eliminate waste . A Moral P estilence A MERICAN members of the Roman Catholic Church have frequently shown a disposition to minimize the importance of certain of the church 's official doctrines . The Nation has defended thern  --  as it did during the recent presidential campaign  --  because it believed in their sincerity and because it was entirely convinced that , to take a specific example , the Americanism of Al Smith was far more deeply rooted in his nature than any Roman doctrines ever had been . But the church itself makes no compromise and it never hesitates to embarrass its liberal members by emphasizing the things which many of them would ' prefer to have left in the background . Thus the very first book to issue from the new state printing house of the Vatican is a revised edition of the Index of Prohibited Books , and the edition is accompanied by a document from the pen of Cardinal Merry del @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the church to the right to prescribe in detail what may and may not be read . Lovers of the picturesque will be pleased . They will see something exquisitely appropriate in the fact that the newly established state should begin in the good old way , and they will be delighted to learn that Catholics are again commanded to remain ignorant of Gibbon 's " Rome , " Darwin 's " Origin of Species , " Kant 's " Critique , " certain writings of Joseph Addison , all the works of Maeterlinck , and the English Book of Common Prayer . They will attribute the fact that no American books are specifically forbidden to the further fact that neither the Pope nor Cardinal Merry del Val have in all probability ever heard of H. L. Mencken . Finally they will read with amazement the Cardinal 's assurance that such a list in no way interferes with the freedom of the individual  --  until they perceive from the context that by " freedom " the ecclesiastic means only the theological doctrine of the freedom of the will . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic church than they are in tolerance ; those who would like to see the liberty of the press flourish in America along with a broad political tolerance of the Catholics themselves , can not be other than distressed to recognize the opportunity which such a document as the present affords to the fanatics who believe that all Catholics are ruled from the Vatican . The Cardinal says exactly what every believer in the Popish Plot would wish him to say . Even the Bible must not be read except in the versions prepared for the purpose of justifying the Catholic position . " Those who wish , " the Cardinal declares , " to feed the Holy Scriptures to people without any safeguards are also upholders of free thinking , than which there is nothing more absurd or harmful . .. . Only those infected by that moral pestilence known as liberalism can see in a check placed on unlawful power and profligacy a wound inflicted on freedom . " It is useless to urge that , in America at least , there are doubtless many thousands of practicing Catholics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have literate habits are accustomed , before beginning a novel by Balzac or Victor Hugo , to ascertain whether or not that particular volume has been forbidden them . They are not , in other words , by any means as ignorant and uncultivated as their leaders would have them nor do they take very seriously certain phases of the authority which they nominally accept . But the fact remains that whatever the habits of these liberal Catholics may be , the doctrine of their church is unalterably opposed to very nearly every tenet of the liberal creed . Liberalism is , officially , a " moral pestilence , " and as long as they remain officially members of the church they can have no logical defense against the accusations of those who assume that in their hearts they believe what their church tells them they must believe . The Nation will continue to defend the political rights of Catholics in this country . It will continue to believe that , as far as the United States is concerned , the Klan variety of Protestantism is more dangerous to intellectual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover it has faith in the liberal Catholic and hopes that he may ultimately have some influence upon the official doctrines of the church . When , for example , it hears of one Cardinal forbidding his followers to send their children to other than parochial schools , it can not but confess the wish that some of these liberals would make its task easier by speaking out more frankly . Their sentiments are known by their conduct ; they disobey many of the commands of the church , and they are willing to explain away many of its doctrines . But it is difficult to defend on pragmatic grounds the members of an organization which stresses its rational consistency . The opinion of individuals can hardly be cited in argument when these individuals declare their allegiance to a sect which denies the right of an individual to hold an opinion . The liberal who follows where abstract logic would lead him can not be other than anti-Catholic , and Catholicism insists upon the supremacy of abstract logic . The Riot at Auburn A GAIN a bloody riot in Auburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the official reaction is one of rage and vengeance . To our deep regret Governor Roosevelt has led the chorus . He will appoint a special trial term of the Supreme Court " as quickly as possible " ; the persons responsible for the riot  --  at least seven convicts  --  will be tried for murder , and " dealt with with immediate and drastic severity . " He does this " in justice to the family of the principal keeper who was killed , to the guards who were wounded , and to the other guards and State troopers who acted with such conspicuous bravery . " Now , we , too , have the deepest sympathy with the family of the principal keeper and with the wounded . But the best way to serve them is not to take further vengeance upon men already in jail for the better part of their lives , but to remedy the conditions which are producing the riotg . Will the killing of seven more criminals act as a deterrent ? We do not believe so . Ever since the July revolt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely no occupation and only one hour of exercise in the yard a day , has been inflicted upon the offenders . Did it deter another outbreak ? It did not , and neither will putting seven to death . Only a change of the horrible conditions under which the convicts are living will end the desperate unrest , The prison is overcrowded ; the food is extremely bad ; the bulk of the men have sat idly in their cells with nothing to do , and the long sentences of the reactionary and wicked Baumes laws , instead of over-awing them , rouse them to bitterness ; the Governor himself is quoted as recognizing the evil influence of these laws which have had no effect in decreasing criminality . Now , after this second riot , a temporary warden has been appointed , Dr. Frank L. Christian , who has at once restored the normal conditions of work and recreation which should have been reestablished long months ago . The officials from Governor Roosevelt down knew that they were sitting over a volcano in Auburn , that the men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To our minds those guilty of the death of the principal keeper and of the convicts , therefore , are the State officials and the Legislature of the State of New York . The Governor should have called a special session of the Legislature after the Auburn and Dannemora outbreaks of last summer to demand a complete reform of the whole prison system . He plans now to put prison reform at the head of the program he will urge upon the Legislature when it meets next month ; but what he will ask is apparently only $30,000,000 for new buildings to be erected over a period of years . What he should tell the State is that the whole treatment of prisoners is wrong , utterly out-of-date , contrary to science , contrary to decency , without reforming value , and actuated only by an abominable spirit of vengeance . Let him point to the recent reforms in Russia , Prussia , and Mexico ; let him demand that the whole prison system be modernized . He would be justified if he should drop everything else and give his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inhumane prison conditions .
