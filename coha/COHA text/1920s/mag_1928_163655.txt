When the thing was settled , there was a moment of political silence . Hoover was forgotten for a minute while politicians considered the men around him , the new faces , the new commanders . First of all they saw a bland , pink-and-gray Iowa lawyer who was saying very little and looking very cheerful . He was James W. Good , who has managed the Hoover campaign , who may well become the new chairman of the Republican National Committee and who , if he does , is well assured of a good cabinet post if he wants it . Newsmen call him " Sir James " for his fine manners . <P> The previous political history of James W. Good is creditable but it is not spectacular . He was born in Cedar Rapids 62 years ago . He served in Congress seven times ( 1909-21 ) and retired when he was chairman of the pivotal Committee on Appropriations . Since then he has practiced law in Chicago and raised potatoes and angora goats in North Dakota . He met the Beaver Man in 1921 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed the Coolidge campaign in the West in 1924 . When Hoover asked him a year ago to Hooverize the U. S. , Good consented with pleasure . Of what he has done since , Mr. Good speaks modestly : <P> " ... A large number of prominent men with experience in politics came forward and assisted to perfect the organization . Then we went ahead and did efficient work . Oh , yes , I will admit that it is an efficient organization . " <P> It is doubtful if this account of the campaign machine would seem accurate to the men whom Hoover beat . To them Good 's success is almost sinister . They see in him an almost Catilinian figure who , by some mysterious and influential energy , succeeded in making use of the most miscellaneous collection of backers that any nominee could have . Able political writers , well aware of this , are equally amazed at Good 's adroit handling of a difficult endeavor . Wrote a thoughtful correspondent to the New York Sun : <P> " Called to command , he found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a few of them outcasts from the G. O. P. He looked again and discovered also in the loose and undisciplined Hoover ranks , in addition to half-ruined guerrillas that were beginning to pluck up hope , an assortment of poets , prophets , hymn singers , professional reformers , unclassified uplifters , novelists , Federal office holders , reformed bootleggers , Anti-Saloon League superintendents , society leaders , social climbers , lame ducks and efficiency experts . This would have dismayed an ordinary general . But Jim Good is not an ordinary general . He took hold of this crowd and patiently instilled into its mixed elements of fanaticism and craftiness , its curiously contrasting elements of idealism and greed , the dependable , cooperative discipline of a magnificent partisan machine . He made them click-the whole lot of them , poets and place hunters-and the result was one of the most sweeping and astonishing triumphs we know anything about . " <P> Other faces in the miscellaneous bodyguard of Hooverism include the following : <P> James P. Goodrich , oldtime rough-and-tumble boss from Indiana , until now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen , journalist and onetime ( 1919-23 ) Governor of Kansas , famed also for his connection vith the globe-circling University Afloat ( TIME , May 16 , 1927 ) .
