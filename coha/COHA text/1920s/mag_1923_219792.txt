Twenty years ago Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt organized the International Woman Suffrage Alliance . On May 12 that organization opens its biennial convention in Rome , and Mrs. Catt has announced that she will finally retire from the Presidency which she has held since 1904 . As a lecturer and woman suffrage leader she is known throughout the country and also as a most prominent advocate of the Nineteenth Amendment . During recent months she has been touring South America , arousing the proponents of suffrage in those countries . Her last official act as President of the International Alliance will be to make a report on the woman movement in these Latin countries . <P> Mrs. Catt 's work in South America may have some bearing on the selection of her successor . Inasmuch as an Anglo-Saxon has been President of the organization since its inception , it is thought advisable to elect a " Latin " woman as the next President . International politics , however , will play its part . If a French or Italian woman were elected there is fear that the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President of the National League of Women Voters and delegate to the Convention from the United States , predicted that the next President of the Alliance would be a South American woman . <P> Part of the program of the convention will be consideration of independent citizenship for married women . Hitherto , in most countries , women have assumed the nationality of their husbands upon marriage . Under the Cable Law , passed last year , marriage does not affect citizenship status in the United States . So if a foreign woman marries an American citizen , although in many cases her native country disowns her , she does not automatically acquire American citizenship . The Alliance wants to do away with these " women without countries " by having measures similar to the Cable Law passed by other nations . Bills to this effect are pending in Great Britain and France .
