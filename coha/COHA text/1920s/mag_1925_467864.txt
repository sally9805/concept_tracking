DESPITE all reluctance to rob numerous grave people of a cherled topic of conversation , I venture to Clare that American " materialism " not the sole enemy of American art .. ; a matter of simple fact , no enemy of e arts is preventing them from enjoy ; various degrees of progress ; and as - materialism , they progress not only spite it but sometimes , as we shall because of it . Incidentally it might . observed that even were the case aerwise , art possesses no magic power which it could transmute this iterialism with one swift gesture . There are , however , two obstacles Lich just now prevent progress from ing much more rapid , and they come ; ically within the domain of art for eisideration . For these hamper all orts made by the organized forces of to quicken the creative spirit widely , they hamper them from within . The first of these two obstacles is the t of degradation . It would be intering but very dangerous to say where s cult probably had its origin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be wrong . But from atever hands its members received torch , they do not now hold it : 11 , but low , in order that no sewer , y escape them . Vow a man 's desire to explore a i'er may be greatly to his credit . rtainly , not one hindrance should n- prevent him from exploring a ; er to his heart 's content . He may . n be praised for wishing to clean out ; ewer . But when he begins to take de in feeling at home in a sewer , and en his friends become evangelistic in ' claiming that a sewer is the one great haven where the unfettered should come to rest , there might reasonably be some question about the man 's spiritual health and about his relation to artistic progress . Without the slightest musty sentimentalism over America , it must be said that this cult seems exotic among us . We may not be the least bit better than any other people on the face of the earth , but we have plenty of fresh air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of sordidness ; we have not been in America long enough to have it otherwise . But those of the cult of degradation laugh at the thought of anything invigorating or wholesome in America . Life is not even a bad dream ; it is just chaos . Life is not even a good joke ; it is just gray dirtiness . Life is not hell for the unfortunate ; it is hell for everybody . And art in America ! Bah ! So they turn in hope to Europe , as all of us do when art comes to our thoughts . But how interestingly they reason ! In Europe , they argue , there has been a great art . There has been also no little dirtiness of one kind or another . So if we will but import the dirtiness , great art will necessarily follow . In the meantime no subterranean passage at home must be left unoccupied if it will help a man to feel debased . Now it is strictly on the basis of art that I have a quarrel with this cult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one of the conditions on which good art is produced is that the artist shall find a relatively disinterested significance in the material he treats . As soon as he grows too eager to use his material as propaganda , his artistic relation with his material ceases to be an honest one . So we have ramping pagans overemphasizing in their stories their particular dogmas of morals . We have anaemic , pimply whippersnappers professing to write the great American novel or play or poem , or paint the great American masterpiece , by bringing into high relief the sordidness in which they find their greatest comfort . Their fellow cultists slap them on the back in congratulation and turn to a mystified public to proclaim that , at last , real artistic genius has appeared in America . In this turning to the public with the propagandist 's zeal lies the chief injury which the cultists do to the cause of a more virile national art . They are understood and perhaps properly evaluated by their fellow workers in the artistic field . But with the public the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of art and yet be in possession of a perfectly sound emotional outlook upon life . So when they see this work of the cultists they feel its essential dishonesty as certainly as they feel the difference between Abraham Lincoln and a ward politician . Before it they experience nothing of the disinterested exaltation which one enjoys before a work of art that has been conceived in high honesty . When they venture to protest they are told that they " do n't know art when they see it " ; they are made to understand that the sewer is sacred ground . People who regard it in any other manner are narrow . So the artist in the rough who is everywhere in the public ? the one who is the forerunner of the man who will do the " great American " art if it is ever done ? turns away sadly or contemptuously . Men who feel something of the mighty struggle , the desperation , the experiment. , and the romance of American life in the large will not enlist when they are appealed to in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only degraded but dishonest . See , then , how this cult of degradation makes the way hard for every hone experimenter in art . Some one mu always blaze new trails . Some one mu explore seemingly arid fields . Some of must make incursions into the sew ( even ? when he feels sure that art lighting his hazardous path . But w will be inclined to give any expo : menter a fair chance when those wl unshrinkingly proclaim themselves to the only true experimenters alwa round up in the same dirt of life ? F the interested public the simplicity the adventure becomes too great ! 2 ways there is temptation to look behi : experiment for a motive that is not t artistic one . So the honest crusad , when he does appear , is always cc fronted with a public predisposed disregard his honesty of intent . He treated as though all " new " art w ( necessarily inconsequential , often nasi and always abnormal . The second obstacle to a wid , quickened spirit of artistic expression the museum habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some kind of inclosure for ex hition purposes . How this habit mind has become well-nigh universal America is not difficult to see . C national culture is a creation , not growth . In order to have any art all ready to hand , we had to huddle together in strategic places . Then began to educate the people in appreciation of art ? by means of amples from the museum . Natura enough , most people thought of art something remote from the every ( world ; few people ? few towns , ever could afford a museum . This habit of mind , the natural o growth of a righteous zeal in the inter of art , has come to be an unbelieva force in causing art to be regarded extraneous to life . One important art whose passion for years has been to h : many people enjoy art and produce has gone so far as to advocate closing of museums to all except art and students of the history of art , ? der that the people might come to link of art aright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) think about it at all . Yet there is such ground for his contention . A ) ung man goes from a small town , or om the country , to see some art . He iters the museum , an able custodian . brass buttons sells him a catalogue , id he plunges into the maze of form and ilor . Once in ten thousand times he ill be so much of an artist at heart ' at not even this overwhelming array in daunt him ; in the other nine rousand nine hundred and ninetyne cases he will be suffocated , eon ? unded , or filled with an inferior relatment . But he does not come to iwn often ; this is art that he is seeing ; is in a museum ; and for social rea'as , if no other , he ought to like it . verywhere about him he sees people ho do . And should he tour Europe he would e the galleries there in precisely . the me spirit . He finds art only in conomerate huddles . He looks at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lifted from the routine of his lily life into disinterested ecstasy but identify , as a schoolboy identifies ewers for a lesson in botany . So he turns from this supposed liberalizing perience more confirmed than ever his habit . He probably did not Link of numerous chateaux and village turches , when they flew by him on his urneys , as art at all , Art is something r exhibition purposes at a fixed price T person . Now this habit of mind would not be harmful if it resulted only in the reirding of art as a part of a museum . ut the converse is just as true . It gards things outside a museum as not ing art . Outside a museum there is label to guide one . If the museuminded person were to come upon an ilabeled Tintoretto in a dingy cabin Snake hollow or on Bristle Ridge , would be unable to say whether or A it was a work of art . Should any question at all concerning it arise in his mind , it would be as to whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple question of his liking it would not arise ; and if it should do so he would be obliged to give himself an evasive answer . How is he to know ? Certainly no one would expect him to be attracted by it as a child is held rapturous by anything which affords a high degree of emotional integration . This is the artistic habit of mind in America outside the larger centers . And sometimes one need not go outside the larger centers to find it ! It makes of the so-called cultured classes a group of passive appreciators . It influences institutions of higher learning so that most of them do not . attempt to offer courses that unfold the creative spirit and make art vital by making it a matter of participation , but instead , courses in the appreciation of museums . It influences the man in the street so that he bewilderingly observes , " Well , I like to go round and look at that picture once in a while ? just stand and look at it . But I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Its entire influence , so far as the uninitiated are concerned , is to make art seem remote . Art springs from somewhere , to be sure ; but not from anywhere close to their own daily lives . Not that I would belittle the museum ! Would that we had numberless additional ones , and that they might be better than any we now possess ! Their function could be extended without undue effort so that some of them might serve chiefly in showing the people how they could use artistically such modest materials as they may have at their disposal . But thus far their influence upon the creative spirit has been most properly that of an historical record , and as a workshop for the initiated . This influence , though definite , is restricted to a relatively small number . And sometimes it has not been so efficacious in moving people to new and vigorous expression in art as in determining social supremacy at the dinner table . Art is sought as a hallmark of culture , as something fine to be busied with , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder that so many think seldom and little of a widely disseminated art impulse such as might help to convert men 's spirits and the world into something of which we need not be ashamed ! When we turn to consider the arts which have stimulated the creative spirit importantly , we find that they are the ones which have least encountered these obstacles and have been looked upon by a great many people as a normal activity which has sprung from sonic yearning of everyday life . Conversely , the ones which have appealed little to creative-minded persons the country over are the ones that have been very consciously thought of as art , as something removed . It was , for instance , long taken for granted ? and in most rural communities is still taken for granted ? that the study of art meant the study of painting . Sometimes it included sculpture , but not often and not importantly in the art schools which young ladies attended in the latter half of the Nineteenth Century ; for sculpture requires the study of the nude , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with colleges ? by the irate parents of these young ladies had the word gone abroad that they were doing nude figures . Painting was more simply managed , as anyone can see by referring to the catalogues and illustrated circulars sent out by the less cosmopolitan and more academic schools of that time . In the numerous " art departments " where it was taught , it rarely developed any strong virtues or any robust vices that would cause people to take it seriously . It was " just art . " As a result of this feeling and practice and the only half-open doors to young ladies who wished to enter the more " masculine " fields of academic stud : the young ladies painted pictures . C to the attics of tens of thousands Middle Western homes to-day ? and many instances to the stuffy , unus ( parlor ? and you can collect carloads such paintings . Go to the dingie household in the seclusion of the Oh or Indiana hills and you will find thethe same kind of " art . " That famihad no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " painted pictures in the sho window of the largest store in the tom not far away , and allowed everyone wf would to observe him at his work . T painted his picture upside down order to mystify still further his publ who stood outside the window . Wh ( lie had finished he flopped the pictu : gracefully over on the easel , and the stood a noble deer looking across silvery lake at mountains which stoc up as regularly as inverted ice-crea cones . And the public bought h " works of art " at one dollar and fifi cents a picture , frame included . Those who view the dusty highwa : of life from a comfortable office in ti top of a skyscraper are always in clang of forgetting that just such trivialiti. in education have given the rural ar smalltown Americans ? and that meal most Americans . even yet ? whatev. background of artistic tradition tilt possess . When it is remembered th ; these communities have provided th ; middle-class life so often appealed to the name of art , it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never looked upon art as matter of life and death . And when 1 is often helped by the cult of degrad tion to see that art is not only trivial bi unwholesome , his relatively sound pre udices direct him elsewhere for ein tional experience . Two arts , however , have established right foundation for rapid and perm . nent growth . These are architecture at the drama . By good fortune all of the preliminai requirements for an architectural renal ince in America have been met . We ave had the necessary material proserity to encourage both business and idividuals to build to their liking ; we ave had a sufficiently long period of - aining in the fundamentals as they re taught in other countries ; we have eveloped powerful and efficacious - ! hools of structural engineering ; and s parts of the most vigorous universies and schools of technology , we have last many high-grade schools of rehitecture . So we have everything appily working for an architecture hich is sound in tradition , yet which - rings from the necessities and the mper of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ut they also want them good-looking . hey intrust their ideas to an architect ho proposes a towerlike skyscraper which , despite all the scoffing of Euromns at the characteristic American ; , line , must in its recent develop.ents be regarded as an object of beauty id majesty . Singularly enough , the meriean business man seems to feel of his universal genius when he intemplates building ; he is usually - ady to give the architect something ) proaching a fair chance . These same isiness men want houses in which to Frequently one man and his miiy must have three or four ! Here gain the commercial genius stands . ady to recognize not only the compeTree but the necessity of the architect 's Iviee . So the architect has ridden on ie tide of material prosperity to a isition where he can actually express ealism in his work . Fortunately , too , he does not restrict imself to planning skyscrapers and . ansions for millionaires . He designs ? pool buildings and hospitals for cities id towns ; lie designs chapels for villages - though none too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tens ' thousands of farmers and modest borers who would build and who have mile to think a little about building as ! autifully as possible . Sometimes the architect has gone so far as to override the politician and design beautiful government buildings ! His way is not a triumphal procession , of course . Yet he occupies the position of an idealist who makes the materialist like idealism , and who makes him pay for it . His dream is not too far separated from the materialist 's life . There it is , vast and brilliant , towering to the skies . And best of all , the architect 's evangelization is reaching every corner of the country , so that architecture is becoming more and more a normal part of everyone 's thinking . Not only hundreds of thousands of readers , but millions see periodicals each month which print drawings and elevations of all types of houses which might interest a prospective builder . These plans , to be sure , are not always the best possible ones ; and if all of the readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be noticeable . But these matters are more or less beside the point . The people are thinking architecture ; and from all of this thought there must spring more and more houses which are not only habitations but in some slight degree works of art . Daily their occupants may look upon them mustlook upon them ; and around them must center all the most intimate associations of a lifetime . This , in truth , is making art a part of the life of the people . Incidentally it is developing among the people a feeling for the one art that helps all the others to attain the architectonic significance without which art remains only a kind of fancywork . The record of the drama , the second art that has so rapidly come to be looked upon as a normal kind of activity in America , is scarcely less encouraging . No one could deny that the career of the American people has been dramatic in the sense that it has been adventurous , picturesque , full of demands for resourcefulness , and ? it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " acting " that will get a man " by . " Yet in the main , only producers of plays of no high social standing , and such vivid interpreters of American life as Buffalo Bill , dared to think of this material as the stuff of which drama is made . The sophisticated commercial theater oscillated between burlesque and " imported masterpieces " ; the sophisticated college communities read Shakespeare , and occasionally , if the religious denomination in control were not too hostile , performed " The Merchant of Venice . " Youth is always ready to become dramatic ; but because the theater so frequently scandalized the people ? notably in the smaller centers ? who turned to it for amusement , there was often an open hostility toward anything that pertained to stage production . When we reflect that students in American colleges were disciplined for having gone to see so recent a play as " The Passing of the Third Floor Back , " we may appreciate how slowly denominational colleges relinquished their hold on the dramatic inclinations of their students . And today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only playwright who has the honor to be represented on the college stage . Nevertheless , some of the colleges did begin to think of drama as something that might have a place outside the recitation room . And American colleges are so constituted that if the champion of a new cause can only prove that some other college has espoused it , no matter where or under what circumstances , lie can enlist virtually all of them , So , under the pressure of the dramatically inclined students , institutions of learning began to accept the drama as a matter of some importance . They were cheered on their way sometimes by finding that some college professor had actually written a play that would " work " on the stage ? such as , for instance , William Vaughan Moody 's " The Great Divide . " So those few who persisted in asking why we might not have an American drama found themselves supported in a unexpected quarter . Here were bodie of young instructors and students i colleges and universities who saw in th writing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a local celebrities who appeared in th glare of the footlights . In this college movement for a dram of national life many tireless men an women have given their intelligence their utmost energy , and their long suffering patience . Professor George I Baker has done more , unquestionabl3 than any other college man of his time Ile also bears the distinction of bein4 so far as I know , the most maligned ma who ever attempted to do anything fc American art . When he decided to tr the experiment of play production in a important way he was railed at h commercial producers , he was denounce by the professional critics , he wa sneered at by his academic colleague : Some of his critics found it so difficul to express an adequate contempt fc him and his work that they had to drat upon the resources of foreign tongue ' Newspaper reporters in New York an elsewhere manufactured interviews i which he was made to say the mix absurd things imaginable about pla production and playwriting . Men wh had never seen one of his performance or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glibly made sarcastic remark about this man who was " trying t make dramatists by formula . " It be came the thing to do ; it revealed one ' superior artistic standing . Most of a to be regretted , some of those who wer privileged to be guests at his " WorI shop " performances did not see th serious significance of what he wa attempting . But he persisted . And now , afte fifteen years of fighting for what of Le must have seemed a lost cause , few me could have greater satisfaction in th fruitage of their labors . We have , as direct result , a number of young wrights who have higher standards ethnic and clearer vision of what the rainatist may attempt than they otherrise could have had . This , I believe it hould be said to his credit , has been his mallest contribution . We have , in the econd place , a group of professional roducers who are less unready to heeve that something may sometimes e learned . We have ? and this seems 3 me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his isciples , and with the disciples of other allege men to whom he gave comfort ' hen they were less strategically situted than he was , who have undertaken 11 sorts of dramatic experiments . Go 3 New Mexico , to Minnesota , to Kansas , ) Illinois , to California , to New York tate , to Dakota , to North Carolina , to ' exas ? and you will find his followers in ew centers of dramatic activity . Their ) 1lowers , in turn , are taking the drama -a better drama than otherwise would ave been possible ? to small towns , to lurch festivals , to consolidated rural pools . One of his students has been ireeting the production of plays ? good lays ? at county fairs ; and he has had iccess . Men and women who never ' fore had seen a play worth seeig ( and probably none at all ) have , ght at their own agricultural fairs , night something of the significance of : ? ama . Now when we see how such work as its ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large and a ) dly company ? must inevitably carry ! w and direct interest in the drama to 1 sorts of people in many places , it is A difficult to understand why young en and women are everywhere atmpting to express the life they know , really dramatic life , in the form of a ay . Not only that ; they are proIcing these plays , and the very people out whom they write are discovering iat there is something dramatic and evated in their own lives . It was ) out the plays written by one such pup of young men and women and ted before the mountaineers of their own state that one of the dramatic critics of New York recently said , " He ( Professor Frederick H. Koch , who directed the work ) is probably doing more to develop an American drama than all the producers and importers in this city . " Other subsidiary activities have grown from this community experience ? masques and pageants and interpretative historical processions . And related to this movement , in spirit if not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theater , by means of which not only young actors but young playwrights have encouragement in a kind of theater which is not commercial yet which is more and more nearly approximating the best commercial producers ' standards of skill . This , to be sure , is a simplified presentation of the case . No one believes that an American drama is made . There is much groping , much floundering ; but there is also much intelligent effort which promises something in twenty or fifty or a hundred years . In the meantime , whatever may he the explanation , it is possible to say that the center of the theatrical world has been shifted to America . Certainly no one who has been in London recently can say that it is any longer there . We have begun to think drama , to feel drama ; drama has become a passion ; it seems to be a very normal means of expression . And when any art is thus looked upon it develops a substantial vigor which can never be found in the art that is looked upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts for specific mention does not imply that the others are not without life . Poetry , which stands next to these on the right groundwork for a national growth , has become one of the important arts among us with such unobtrusiveness that we are in danger of forgetting its vigor . A dozen years ago so few persons read contemporary poetry that most publishers shunned manuscripts of verse as though they were hooks of perdition ? which , financially , they usually were . To-day a young poet may have the good fortune to sell ten thousand copies in one year . And the young who are expressing themselves in verse with sincerity and beauty , and often with distinction , are numerous . If anyone inclined to be skeptical of all things contemporary should wish to see whether or not we are more fortunately established to make progress in poetry than we were twenty-five years ago , let him turn back to the magazines , the weeklies , and other periodicals then current , and spend an hour among the undistilled conceptions and jaded adjectives ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place has been accepted in American letters for many years , but of the young poets who have appeared within a decade : Edna St. Vincent Millay , Du Bose Heyward , Hervey Allen , Elinor Wylie , Muna Lee , Herbert Gorman , Joseph Auslander , Maxwell Bodenheim , Robert Hillycr , Foster Damon , Allen Crafton , Eloise Robinson , and others that can be omitted only with unfairness . Or if he wishes to get the perspective of a longer period , let him turn back , for instance , to the Forget-Me-Not books of 18e6 or 1828 , read there the verse of such young writers as Longfellow , N. P.Willis , George D. Prentice , and James G. Percival , and determine whether we have not in a hundred years come to a more genuine practice of the art of verse . Some one may protest some one always may that we need more writers with breadth of vision . To this it may be replie that the conditions are now beneficen and if they remain so for a time , impartial laws of chance will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important matter is that we have a rived at the stage where poets , and a sorts of non-commercial magazines verse , can actually get a hearing . An excellent case could be made fi the other arts . Painting is still look ( upon as something exotic ; but wii such interesting enterprises as - el , culating libraries " of paintings in Ne Mexico and elsewhere , added to tl distinguished work of many America painters , painting will gain in favo So will music , although we have tl distinction just now of hearing the be performers in the world and of doit far less in musical composition than several of the other arts ? possibly tilt in any of them . But architecture and drama point tl way , because they have induced artist stirrings among the people who mo need art and who , in turn , will mal artistic expression most robust . Tl. problem of building the arts upon ti life of the country as it is must be faced I all of the arts . When it is faced frank the provincial-minded politician need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad to study remains at home . With many at wo in the required high fervor of spir American art ? which is only anoth way of saying good art will ever where be more in evidence .
