Charge d'Affaires H. Dorsey Newson of the U. S. Legation at Ottawa spoke crisply , last week , to newsgatherers : " The Government of the United States has acquired the property at 98-100-102-104 Wellington Street , Ottawa , for the purpose of constructing a building to house the offices of the various Government departments in the Capital . . . . Upon the termination of existing leases , it is contemplated that the two brick buildings now standing on the property will be removed and a handsome new edifice erected , which may be four or five stories in height . " <P> Commentators observed that no matter what the nature of the new building may turn out to be , it will resemble all other U. S. legations to the extent of having for its telegraphic and cable address the code word " Amlegation . " Citizens of the U. S. who rove abroad would do well to remember also that in capitals where the U. S. is represented by an Ambassador his address is " Amembassy , " plus , of course , the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
