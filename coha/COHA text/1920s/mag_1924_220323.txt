Although women may vote in Britain and may sit , if elected , in the House of Commons , the House of Lords still remains the Sanctum Sanctorum of lordly males . <P> For many a long month , the ladies of the land , led by the estimable Lady Rhondda , have sought to soften their lordships ' hearts , but in vain . <P> During the past week , Viscount Astor , husband of the famed first woman M. P. , championed the ladies ' cause . When a bill to permit peeresses in their own right to take their seats in the House of Lords was introduced , Astor exhorted their lordships thus : <P> " Fewer than two dozen peeresses will be affected by the bill . The House of Lords ought to reflect more accurately the opinion of the 8,000,000 women voters in the country . On a large number of questions there is a woman 's point of view ; many men differ from it , but that there is such a point of view is unarguable . Besides , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one woman , Miss Margaret Bondfield , occupies a seat on the Treasury ' bench . " <P> Lord Banbury , embittered antifeminist , exclaimed as he moved rejection of the bill : <P> " I have never met anyone , except members of the Labor Party , who does not regret that we have women in the House of Commons . " <P> " Hear , hear , " interposed Lord Birkenhead , whilom " Galloper Smith . " <P> Continued the irrepressible Banbury , whose nickname is " the Banbury bun " : <P> " One of the ablest members of the House of Commons said only this year of the including of women in Parliament : ' What we have lost in dignity we may have gained in efficiency . ' For ages , this House has been regarded as the ideal of all Parliaments . Are the noble Lords to sacrifice the dignity of this House on the chance of gaining a little efficiency ? " <P> Then up spake the erstwhile Judge of the King 's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit . Said he : <P> " The age of chivalry is passed , when women watched the ancestors of the noble Lords tilt in the lists . In this age we watch cowgirls at a tournament . So why should not women sit in this House ? Would their presence detract from its dignity ? If I were to say what I think - " <P> Then smiling at their lordships under his 74-year-old eyebrows , he added : " But I wo n't , " and sat down .
