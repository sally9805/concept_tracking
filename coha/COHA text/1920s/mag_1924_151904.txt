Closely following his notification in Evanston , and only the day after John W. Davis ' second speech , Charles G. Dawes went to Maine in preparation for the September election there . Until a week or two ago , there was great uncertainty as to which of two candidates was going to be the . Republican nominee for Governor . There was a prolonged recount contest between Ralph O. Brewster , who went into the primaries with Klan support , and his opponent , who was anti-Klan . Finally , only a few days ago , the nomination was given to Brewster . <P> The day General Dawes appeared there , Mr. W. R. Pattangall , the Democratic nominee , aiming to take advantage of the Klan split in the Republican ranks , published in the newspapers two questions addressed to General Dawes : <P> " Do you agree to the proposition set up by the Republican managers of Maine that a vote for a Klan-controlled candidate is a vote for Coolidge and Dawes ? " <P> " Do you believe that the Ku Klux Klan fills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <P> In opening his speech at Augusta , General Dawes launched directly into the Klan question : <P> " The questions of Mr. Pattangall , which appear in the press this morning , are the familiar trick questions of the ordinary politician . They are not the cause of the statement I am about to make . <P> " Let me say at once that I recognize that the Ku Klux Klan in many localities and among many people represents only an instinctive groping for leadership , moving in the interest of law enforcement , which they do not find in many cowardly politicians and office holders . But it is- not the right way to forward law enforcement . . . . <P> " Appeals to racial , religious or class prejudice by minority organizations are opposed to the welfare of all peaceful and civilized communities . " <P> He continued , touching on Mr. Davis ' speech : <P> " Every honest man is as indignant as Mr. Davis is at a betrayal by anyone of the high trust of public office , but they also expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orators seek to present facts in their proper and correct relation to the welfare of the people . Common sense and fairness alike revolt at the suggestion that these individual derelictions , which the Administration has set out to punish , should outweigh , in the judgment of American citizens , the honesty and the accomplishments of the most successful business administration of Government our people have ever had . . . . <P> " American labor knows that its interests are subserved by the position of the Republican party on the tariff . It knows that its welfare depends upon the protective tariff policy sponsored by the Republican Party ; and that the reversal of that policy , demanded by the Democratic Party , means lower wages and a lower standard of living . It knows that the success of LaFollette means chaos , out of which can only come lower wages and lower standards of living for all our people . ... <P> " The benefits of trade unions , honestly administered , are recognized not only by me , but by good citizens generally , whether in or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dignified labor , and in so doing it has been an element in the progress of our Nation . ...
