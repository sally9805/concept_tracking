These are the plays which in the light of metropolitan criticism seem most important : <P> THE LAUGHING LADY-Ethel Barrymore is back in the drawing room . As the somewhat declass Lady Marjorie , she is epigrammatically but insistently prudish about her love affair with the brilliant , married lawyer who flayed her in the divorce court . <P> PEER GYNT-Ibsen 's poetic phantasmagoria of self-sufficient compromise , with expressionist settings . Joseph Schildkraut is the braggart Peer , whose age and locality change with equal celerity . <P> ROMEO AND JULIET-Jane Cowl and Rollo Peters offer a vitalized Romeo and Juliet . The interpretation is not notable for subtlety or profundity . Careless enthusiasm is its chief charm . <P> Moscow ART THEATRE-It is a very trifling barrier that the Moscow players use their native tongue . The reality and expressiveness of the performance make broader meanings as clear as daylight and inconceivably moving . This is the most justly famous group of actors in the world . Plays by Tchekov , Gorki , Tolstoi , are presented . <P> THE GOD OF VENGEANCE-The daughter of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim to her environment in a repulsively explicit scene vith a Lesbian . Rudolph Schildkraut makes the father 's misery immensely moving . <P> MERTON OF THE MOVIES-A skilful dramatization of Harry Leon Wilson 's story of the movie-struck youth who quite unintentionally becomes a great comedian , with a corresponding loss of illusions . <P> RAIN-A devastating attack on the missionary who uses the Bible as a club to drive lost sheep into the fold . The play is distinguished by Jeanne Eagels ' acting and by real rain falling dismally throughout . <P> SEVENTH HEAVEN-Helen Menken begins as the timorous sister of an absinthe-soaked shrew , but at the end of the second act , her courage restored by love , she turns on the sister and lashes her with a black whip . <P> LOYALTIES-The adventures of a rich and disagreeable Jew , persecuted by amiable clubmen , prove that conflicts in loyalties may bring disaster . The play is always interesting , if somewhat theatric . <P> KIKI-Lenore Ulric as the little Parisienne who is not quite naughty and altogether captivating .
