The united diplomatic front so long presented by the powers toward China was seriously weakened last week by the release of a British note calling upon the other powers to grant important concessions to the Chinese . <P> Proposed Concessions : 1 ) immediate granting of permission to the Chinese to increase their customs dues , as was envisioned in the Washington Treaties ; 2 ) gradual abolition of the extraterritoriality system , whereby foreigners are tried before foreign courts in China ; 3 ) renegotiation of the chief Chino-Foreign treaties , looking toward their revision ; 4 ) disavowal by the powers of any intention to " control an unwilling country . " The publication of these British proposals came as a diplomatic bombshell and succeeded last week only in antagonizing all the nations concerned . <P> France . Foreign Minister Briand announced that his Government did not find itself in harmony with the British proposals . In this attitude was seen the influence of French exporters who have profited enormously by Chinese boycotting of British goods . Obviously they will not help Britain to clear herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain is the true oppressor of China . <P> Japan . Baron Shidehara , the Japanese Foreign Minister , took approximately the French stand . Japanese are not willing to " renegotiate " out of existence the loans upon which China owes repayment to Japan . Moreover Japan is on good terms with the North China Dictator Chang Tso-lin ; and sees no advantage in helping the British square themselves with the South China Government which has been maintaining the Anti-British boycott . <P> China . Even the Chinese were suspicious of these sudden British " concessions . " The South China Government had already forced customs concession from Britain so far as it is concerned . Therefore the South Chinese Government saw last week a British scheme to give little or nothing more to South China , but to give to the rival North China Government a chance to collect tax money wherewith to fight South China . In a word the South China Government saw the " concessions " as a British trap . <P> Paradoxically the North China Dictator , Chang Tso-lin , was also vexed , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South China Government , whereas he considers himself the rightful master of all China . <P> Foreigners in China universally pronounced the British note a blunder . Its concessions , they said , came too late , and were too unspecific to allay Chinese suspicion . <P> The U. S. President Coolidge and Secretary Kellogg maintained a pregnant silence , though the President hinted that a change of U. S. policy in the direction outlined by Britain might soon be announced . <P> In State Department circles three points were stressed : 1 ) The traditionally liberal policy of the U. S. toward China is in harmony with the customs and legal concessions proposed by Britain . 2 ) However , the U. S. has always stood for the necessity of a single government of all China ; whereas the British proposals tacitly envision the recognition of the new South China Government on a par with the traditional North China Government at Peking . 3 ) The tone of the British proposal was resented in Washington as implying that Great Britain is the chief defender of Chinese liberty ; an implication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
