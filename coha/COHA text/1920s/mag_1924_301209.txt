Amid the babel of conflicting opinions during the past week , on the future probabilities in business , one strong and uncompromising attitude became conspicuous . This was the " bearishness " of Wall Street . <P> Now the opinion of the business future conveyed through stock market prices is not always right . But neither can it be casually disregarded as merely manipulation . The accuracy of the stock market as a barometer , when one impartially checks the matter up , is impressive . And the stock market during the past week has been quite gloomy as to the industrial conditions just around the corner . <P> Some classes of stocks have taken part in the rally which has occurred since last Fall , and have all along remained at low levels . Such has been the fate of most leather , shipping , rubber and fertilizer shares , and it reflects something tougher than a bed of roses in these particular industries . Now stocks of other classes are beginning to " look sick . " Automobile shares have gone down hill despite advertisements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is little song in the tobacco camp . On the other hand , rails have held rather well . <P> Sometimes the stock market means what it looks as if it meant ; sometimes it does not . But now these have developed outside signs of breakers ahead too . Even realtors are declaring the construction boom , particularly in the East , is somewhat overripe . The usually reliable industrial barometer of steel production has apparently reached its peak and begun to turn downwards , rather the way it did last year . Even the better foreign news has apparently been " discounted " in the markets , and has proved insufficiently cheering to allay a feeling that things are likely to get worse before they get better .
