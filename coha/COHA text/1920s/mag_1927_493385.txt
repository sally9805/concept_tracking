The Week THE surprises in President Coolidge 's message to Congress are few and small . Most of the t 11aings in it he has said before , and he repeats them 0w with a seemin , c , , lack of conviction which lends str - ? rig confirmation to the belief that he does not in-lend to run again . He favors a limited tax reduction , in order to continue to retire the war debt of $18 , - - : 00,000,000 , and avoid the danger of an unbalalled budget . Ile favors some increase in the size the Navy , but not enough to disturb international eaitti ? ns ; the return of the remaining quarter of billion dollars ' WO rth of Alien property , and the - n of z. ; ' federal Department of Education . h'Natio e Wants some sort of federal anti-lynching law ; nandin , oVC/ 0 /C. to tl . states of an increasing hale of responsibility for the Indians ; a Board of 4ediation and Conciliation for the coal industry . cueis willing to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only those which remain 67 ( 111n the Constitution of the United States , which is th the sole power to declare war , He 9POnc - , to government aid for the farmers , ex- ' Pt , , A te . loans ans to marketing organizations . ptiebt ! ivmAnts decrease in the tariff and is againste , ? c operation of Muscle Shoals . Philippine in-vcnclenc:e is so far away that it is not even mentioned , and he is against permitting Porto Rico to elect its governor . The merchant marine should be privately owned and operated . The United States stands ready to cooperate with any government which may emerge in China , and in the meantime will protect its citizens there . He expects a friendly settlement with Mexico , and alleges he is entirely pleased with what has been done in Nicaragua , his brief reference leaving the impression that it was a minor matter , of no importance , and one now ended . THERE are a few things in the . President 's mese sage which we are particularly glad to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regrettable . We welcome his open attack on hired agents of wealth who have conducted propaganda for the repeal of certain taxes , as well as his frank criticism of the Shipping Board for being too much concerned about private interests and insufficiently so about the public welfare . His suggestion that the states should take more responsibility for the Indian tribes within their borders has been made in the New Republic , and , if carried into effect , would help to break the strangling grip of the Indian Bureau . The proposal that a congressional committee should-visit the Philippines every two years should have excellent results , provided the expedition did not de-. generate into a mere junket . We note with pleasure his praise for the United States Employment Service , his support of a federal anti-lynching bill , his endorsement of the badly needed conciliation board for coal and his demand for the return of alien property . Against these items we should set his disingenuous picture of the success of - prohibition and his amazing argument about the tariff . He indicates that it is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of $560,000,000 ? as though it did not alter the prices on domestic manufactures to the value of billions more ! Also , he argues that the farmer is not affected by the tariff , since " everything the farmer now uses in farming is already on the free list . " If the protected manu-facturers do not sell to the farmers , protection must be worth very little to them . It will be news to many . people that farmers do not wear clothing , use steel products , or live in houses . PERHAPS the worst passage in the whole ' document is that referring to Muscle Shoals . Mr. Coolidge knows that the nitrate game is up ; his Department of Agriculture , has told him that " nitrates can probably be produced at less cost by other means than by the use of hydro-electric power . " There remains the matter of the power itself . The President suggests that the plant should be sold , and the proceeds " dedicated to agriculture " by " applying the . revenues received from it to research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to demoistrations and other methods of stimulating its use on the farm . " Was there ever a more absurd linking together Of two totally unrelated matters for the sake of political expediency ? If research into fertilizer is desirable , there is no more reason why funds derived from the sale of Muscle Shoals should be earmarked for that purpose than for similarly setting aside the profits from passport visas . If the sale of Muscle Shoals is desirable , then it should be sold and the profits put into the general funds of the Treasury . As our readers are well aware , the New Republic does not believe that Muscle Shoals should be sold . It regards cheap electric power as of vital importance to the whole nation , including the farmers , and considers that a great plant such as that at Muscle Shoals , in public hands , can serve as a useful pace-maker for an industry which has never been particularly notable for devotion to the public in-. terest , if that public interest conflicts with private IN the New Republic of last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company which may be issued by J. P. Morgan and Company on the score of its doubtful security was based on insufficient information . We are informed that the loan , if issued , will be guaranteed by the Japanese government . The security behind it would , consequently , be just as good as the security behind any other issue of Japanese government bonds . It would differ from the other national obligations of that country only because , in this instance , certain revenues from the South Manchurian Railway would be assigned to meet the interest and principal of the loan . If , as the result of trouble between China and Japan , the property of the Railway Company were injured , the security behind the loan would not be impaired . These being the circumstances , the loan seems to us unobjectionable . It would not mean , as it is alleged to mean , an American underwriting of the Japanese title to the South Manchurian Railway . It would mean merely that American investors were willing to trust the Japanese government with s30,000 , - 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the refinancing of one of its properties and partly for improvements thereon . If it did imply , as the Chinese erroneously think , that Japan was obtaining specific support and endorsement for its position in Manchuria from American sources , the issue of the loan doubtleSs would be and undoubtedly should be forbidden by the State Department . Japan can not reasonably be denied access to the American money market because of its Manchurian policy , but from the point of view of the American investor and of the American policy in the Far East , the Japanese . should be given to understand that its Manchurian enterprise is a liability rather than an asset . PRESIDENT Coolidge and Secretary Mellon deserve unqualified support in their controversy with the United States Chamber of Commerce over tax reduction . The government estimates of future surplus are more to be depended ' upon than any others that are available . Criticism has been unable seriously to shake them . The probable surplus being what it is , it would be folly to risk a deficit by excessive reduction . A deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taxes . Such a policy is bad business for the government and would not be applied to his own business bY , any member of the Chamber . The Committee on : Ways and Means is to be congratulated on recunl ' : mending reductions so little in excess of the amount stipulated by the Secretary of the Treasury . It has also , in some respects , improved upon the specific cuts desired by Mr. Mellon . Most notable is its adverse vote on the proposed repeal of the estate tax . In general , its preference for cutting consumption taxes instead of income taxes is to be commended . We regret only that this tendenc , : was not given greater scope in the Committee framing of the measure . THE bill for tax reduction of the Ways anA Means Committee is , on the whole , politically an economically sensible , but in one respect it petPetu : ates an unfair discrimination against an important national industry and profession . It continues the tax theater tickets which cost over a dollar , and this is a gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama . There is no reason for such a discrimination . Moving Pic : tures can be sold cheaper than spoken dramas , btu that is only because the one photographed perf ? , 11110 ' ance can be more widely distributed . A slic drama which costs three dollars to see and beat is being sold at a much smaller margin above its Is of production than is a moving picture which Os twenty-five cents to see . If amusements are to be  - -  taxed , they should be taxed at approximatelytiro , same rate . It may be sound public policy to pose a tax on tickets which cost five dollars or rn ? 4 on the score of their being luxuries , but a three-clvua. lar seat at a theater is not a luxury or an eXtra , : ch fiance . It is a fair price to pay for an article Wn'co , is one necessity of an interesting life for manY Pod ple , and there is no reason to select it , as eornPa . to cheaper forms of amusement , for peculiarlY but ' densome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Convention of League of Women Voters in Albany , Governor Smith reexplained his attitude on prohibition . It is that he is in favor of the enforcement of the law rather than its nullification , but that he Hdoes not believe in its wisdom , and that he will agitate for its modification or repeal . This assertion of opinion is all very well , but it is not explicit on the really important question . Does he intend to emphasize the issue and try to force it into national politics , as Senator Borah is trying to do ? Or is he pursuing a variation of the official program of both parties which is to put it , so far as possible , out of national political discussion ? It should be added that his reference to nullification was not either candid or illuminating . The law is being nullified more because it is being conscientiously disobeyed than because it is being unconscientiously enforced . The real nullifiers of the law are those American citizens who do not enforce it on themselves . The politician who pretends to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who disdains to obey it himself is not occupying a position which is likely to nourish his self-respect or the confidence in him of his fellow citizens . THE Sacco-Vanzetti case broke into the headlines again momentarily last week as several court cases were decided , growing out of the actions of picketers and others who made other public protest . tight participants in the " death march " were acquitted by a jury , creating a useful precedent that Picketing is not " loitering and sauntering . " Another jury disagreed in the trial of Powers Hap-good and Cosmo Carvotti on the serious charge of rioting , for which heavy penalties might have been exacted . Hapgood was found guilty ( as he undoubte ( lY was ) of speaking without a permit , and fined twenty-five dollars . Does this unexpected leniency indicate that Boston , ashamed and repentant , has experienced a change of heart ? We see no evidence that such is the case . In so far as these results were not the accidental result of the jury 's personnel , they ca n't , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episode as promptly and quietly as P ? ssibre . Boston has won its essential point : it has 3,14 Sacco and Vanzetti to death , and can afford a re harmless magnanimity now . But who can : 3114 that , if there were another such case tomor- nw , the civil liberties of those who protested the l C ? n. of the authorities would again be thrust ' tsid e , as ruthlessly as before ? ONE r the most puzzling aspects of the Sacco-anz ? etti. case was offered by the conflicting testi-on tn ? 4 in regard to the relation between the bullet c'undin b body y of Berardelli , the victim , and the h pio lied by Sacco . After the authorities emad either by the prosecution or by the defense pet 1-I en heard and read into the record , there lip- " ' rd - one Major Calvin Goddard who , as a self-invited expert , made certain tests-by a process of his own , tests which led him to the conclusion that the mortal bullet was fired by Sacco 's pistol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Major Goddard 's findings were published in the Popular Science Monthly . Many people wondered why the defense did not reply . The defense was , of course , concerned with the case as presented by the prosecution . Major Goddard 's testimony was invoked neither by the state nor by the informal Advisory Committee ; it had actually no relevance , but it undoubtedly influenced public opinion . Now , however , in the article in the Nation for December 7 , Mr. Arthur Warner gives an account of the case of one Frank Milazzo in Cleveland who was arrested in connection with the murder of one YOrkell . The mortal bullets and Milazio 's pistol were submitted to an expert who found that the bullets were fired from that pistol and no other . Milazzo was charged with the crime ; but just then the Cleveland News discovered that the pistol had not been purchased until a month after the shooting . The expert was Major Calvin H. Goddard . ( Mr. Varner , with scrupulous fairness , records the fact that Major . Goddard thinks the bullets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) LABOR , the organ of the A. F. of L. railway unions and conservative railway Brotherhoods , is not sympathetic with the I. W. W. , and is known for reliable news reporting . Its special correspondent from Colorado states that the crowd of strikers into whom the mine guards shot on November 21 , killing five and wounding twenty-one , were not armed and were separated e'from the mine by an electrically charged barbed-wire fence . Self-defense on the part of the guards did not necessitate the shooting . The shooting , it is believed by the miners , was deliberately planned in order to forestall a settlement , which was imminent at this non-Rockefeller mine because the principal stock-holder is Miss Josephine Roche , a welfare worker who had expressed her sympathy with the strikers . Such a settlement would have been ethbarrassing to the Rockefeller and other mines , which exert a large share of control over the state government and police . Despite the fact that the I. W. W. are leading the strike and were instrumental in break- ing up the A. F. of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes the strikers have - genuine grievances , and is supporting them . The workers , according to Labor 's correspondent , " would quit the I. W. W. 's in a minute if they could only see a chance to get into a regular union . " This chance is , of course , denied by the Rocko. ' feller policy . E also have a statement from Mr. J. F. Wellborn , President of the Rockefeller-owriell Colorado Fuel and Iron Company , to the effect that the disturbance in Colorado " can not properly be called:a strike at all , " that " miners quit work from fear of violence and not from a sense of grievance against their linedeleted increase in wages or change in working conditions , " that the representative of his company union expressed himself as being satisfied with conditions and argued against joining an independent union , and that most of his employees remained at work until intimidated by mass picketing directed by men who " had but recently come to Colorado from other states where they had definite I. W. W. records and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to operate its mines , at a loss , out of a sense of duty to the miners , who want to work , and to the public , which needs coal . Mr. Wellborn doubtless believes all this ? though it will be instantly recognized as the standard defense of all employers against all strikes , no matter what the facts are . But Mr. Wellborn has no means of proving most of it , because the employees have been denied , by Rockefeller policy , any organ of representation independent of company control or pressure . There is no more tragic mistake for an industrial executive than , first , to believe his employees are always satisfied , and second , to deny them any independent means of showing him whether they are satisfied or not . SECRETARY Work , we are glad to see , sticks to his guns on the Boulder Dam project , in spite of the great influence of the power lobby . It is important to recognize exactly what his position is . In his annual report , he records the fact that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when , in reclamation or other works , power development is a logical incident , the Department does undertake it , and to great advantage . The federal government has a legitimate interest in the Colorado project because of the interstate and international bearings , because of reclamation , flood control and water rights . If the government is asked to undertake the project , it must depend largely on income from the power to be generated , in order to retire its great investment . If the power rights can be leased by competitive bidding so as to achieve this result , ' well and good . If not , the government should have the right to build the power plant , and ' dispose of it at a fair price . And if no fair price can be obtained , the government should be authorized to produce the power and sell . it . This alternative is embodied in the Swing-Johnson Bill . And this alternative is what the power interests are fighting . They want to compel the government to lease the power rights . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive " bidding they can get the power more cheaply . The issue between Secretary Work and the power lobby is not an issue between public and private operation . It is essentially an attempt by the Secretary to prevent stealing of government power from the taxpayers . The chief difference between the oil frauds and the power fraud which is now being attempted , is that the oil steal linedeleted subornation of Congress .
