txt The nation 's ' capital tonight is in the most romantic and picturesque spot it has ever occupied for a temporary period , eleven miles from the Georgia mainland on Sapelo Island , where President and Mrs. Coolidge arrived during the day to be the guests of Mr. and Mrs. , Howard E. Coffin for the holiday season . Into this Old World scenery , with the ruins of a Spanish mission of the fifteenth century still standing and live-oaks covered with ? uncanny Spanish moss , the President and Mrs. Coolidge descended after an all-night train trip from Washington , which carried them through four States and brought them at 9 o'clock this morning to the southernmost point of Georgia . The President 's flag flies over a modern Spanish ? home , luxuriously furnished , built on the : site of the old mission and modeled on the severe and artistic lines of the retreats of the early Jesuits . The island which is the Yuletide playground of the President and Mrs. Coolidge is eleven miles long and four miles wide . On it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiance to the present owner . One of a chain that in the early days was the retreat of pirates and later of the Spanish friars , ? Sapelo now presents a picture of natural grandeur as inviting as when the buccaneers roamed these shores and the priests from here began their Christianizing invasions of the mainland . Moss-covered trees hang overthe temporary island capital , and palms and growing flowers are reflected in the pool facing it , while everywhere are to be seen ancient trees , acres of moss-hung forests through which roam deer and where one may see wild turkeys aria an occasional wild peacobk .. The animals , which habitate mostly the less cultivated northern - section of the island , frequently walk undisturbed into the more settled region . They may be seen drinking from the pool , and birds break the stillness of the virgin forest by their songs . In less ? than ? twenty hours from Washington , President and Mrs. Coolidge , journeying by special train over the Atlantic Coast Line , found themselves in this island of beauty , filled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of De Soto 's time through the buccaneer days down , to the Civil War period . 11 President Coolidge watched the V changing scenery early in the morning from the rear platform of his train . As it rapidly passed toward the coast ; the President began to notice touches of semi-tropics , with scrub palmettos , an occasional palm tree and the live-oaks veiled with moss . But before breakfast the air was chilly and frost covered the trees and grass . When the train arrived at Brunswick , a seacoast centre of 15,000 po ulation , the sun was shining brightly . The frost had melted and grass and trees showed a new freshness . Nearly the entire population was at the station or gathered along the palmstudded wide avenues of this old settlement , which lives quietly and comfortably upon its turpentine industry and vichy springs . Leave Train Clad in Furs . Leaving the train clad in furs , the i President and Mrs. Coolidge found I need for their warmth during the five-mile automobile ride through Brunswick to the Sea Island Yacht Club , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . -d met ' them at the station . Although the sun was warm at this time , there was a stiff north wind blowing and the salt air was damp and penetrating . The trip through the winding ocean inlet that encompasses a dozen islands carried the visitors near some of the early historic spots in American history , and as the curtain was lifted on the intimate struggles and life of those days by Mr. Coffin , who acted as guide , the President learned many things that are recorded only in tradition . The trim yacht Zapelo led the slow movement through the course followed by two boats used by army engineers under Colonel E. J. Williams and a swift Coast Guard vessel which at other times chases rumrunners . The air was bracing and as the sun became brighter some of the warmth of the South appeared . St. Simon 's Island , where the water trip to Sapelo began , is quite as historic as any of these coast islands that are now the homes of the rich , including Jekyl Island , on which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ' own one-sixth of the private ' wealth of the world . From the dock of the yacht ' club is seen , throughpalms- and oaks , . the , Spanish-type hotel , ? the cloister , which in its architeCture from that distance has all the charm of an old mission . President Coolidge , before embarking , looked at this view and was photographed holding the red chow , Tiny Tim . The first log hut standing on the shore of the island , the President was told , was used by : Aaron Burr when he fled after he had killed Alexander Hamilton in their ? duel . An immense oak , whose head touched the horizon in the distance , he was assured , was an offspring of a ' tree which had furnished the keel and ribs for the frigate Constitution . He promised to dedicate Sunday afternoon a tablet which will be placed on the tree . , Church Where Wesleys Preached . As the ? yacht- swung closely to the shore the President caught a glimpse of an old church where John and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a village called Frederica ; in 1736 . It is now used by . Episcopalians , and President and Mrs. Coolidge will attend services there Sunday as it is the nearest church to their island retreat . The next thing to arrest his attention was a fort made of ground-up oyster shells and lime , built ' by General James E. Oglethorpe to defend the island villages and Georgia against the Spaniards . Its granitelike nose juts into the inlet . Hundreds of island ' residents stood on its ramparts and waved flags to the President and Mrs. Coolidge , who were on the bridge of the yacht . It was the first time a President of the United States has entered these waters and it was a great treat to the inhabitants , many , of whom were born here  --  and have never left the isolated region . Darien , an old village on the mainland founded by . Scotch Highlanders , is In sight , just before Sapelo is. reached . This place . of 15,000 inhabitants before the Revolution had a bank with deposits of $2,000,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same bank is still in existence , but it has a present capitalization of $25,000 and deposits not much in excess of that . Darien 's prosperity disappeared when the lumber industry lagged hereabouts . ' For more than two hours the yacht with the President and his party glided between the islands . After a luncheon on board , they landed at Sapelo . Received by Soldier Guard . A troop of soldiers under Captain Cameron of the Eighth Infantry stood at attention as the President and Mrs. Coolidge , accompanied by the military aides , set foot on the island , which in former days maintained more than 300 people by its olive groves and sea Isle cotton . There was- a touch of the modern as ' bright new ? automobiles carried the visitors over crude roads to the Coffin Tesidence four miles away . The ? journey was through an avenue of ' live oaks , and an occasional poinsettia appeared through a growth of firs , holly , stately palms and palmettos . Although - the early afternoon sun was bright , the drive became darker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was penetrated . The first part of the drive was through the less-cultivated section where deer were to be seen and herds of goats . Soon the ruins of the Spanish mission . came in view and then the ocean driveway along miles of white beach . In another turn , the cars came to a sudden stop I at the rambling stucco home of the hosts . It was nearly 2 o'clock when the ride ended . The President had absorbed the atmosphere by this time and he seemed to enjoy- the luxury of absolute rest and recreation that was before him as he stepped from the motor . He was smiling , and posed for the movie and still photographers in the patio of- the house and walking along the pool facing it . Several black and white goats with their young appeared and walked up to the edge of the pool - to drink , , just as the President and Mrs. Coolidge and their - hosts . entered the house . Will Attend Rodeo Saturday . On Saturday President Coolidge will attend a rodeo which will be given by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the church on St. Simon 's Island and the dedication of the tablet on the old . oak , the ? President will , go- to . spend the night at a lodge on a 65,000-acre hunting preserve* owned ' by Mr. Coffin onthe mainland thirty miles distant . He will hunt there Monday for deer and wild turkey . The President also plans to visit the plantation of Charles S. Barrett , head of the Farmers ' ' Union , at Peter 's Point , late . on Monday and return to Sapelo Island that evening . Sapelo is twenty-two miles from St. Simon 's Island , connected with the I mainland , where the newspaper correspondents and some members of the President 's party are staying to expedite the sending of news dispatches and pictures to the metro- ' politan papers . The Sikorsky amphibian plane sent here by the Curtiss Flying Service brought these workers back to St. Simon 's in less than twelve minutes , the plane flying at times at a speed of 135 miles an hour and at an altitude of 2,500 feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic advantage they offer as a military base . The plane , which arrived here from Curtiss Field , L. I. this morning , was piloted by Arthur Caperton . It will carry the President 's mail from St. Simons to . Sapeol Island and be for his use otherwise during his stay . ' Soldiers and secret service men are guarding the President and Mrs. Coolidge , who are in. touch with world events by means of a submarine telephone which connects their bedroom with the Executive Offices in Washington . Colonel James F. - Coupal , White House physician , the military aides and fifteen secret service men . under Richard Jarvis are ' sleeping ' in huts on the island , where the party will remain until after New Year 's .
