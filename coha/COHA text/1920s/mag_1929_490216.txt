IT is the very rich people who are the very well-informed people , on certain subjects . Mingling , as we sometimes do , with preposterously wealthy persons , we find ourself ill at ease and conversationally unfit hecause the talk always gets round to the Chippendale influence on the percolators of the Ming dynasty , and other hard subjects . We did n't use to know why that was , but have found out . It is n't because rich people have the leisure to develop their minds , it is because they have a certain stipulated amount of money which has to be spent , come what may . Consequently , in order to import , with any degree of credit to themselves , a fine specimen of the Etruscan Whiffietree , or to construct a room tastefully in period Albanian , they ' first must know something about it . By Heaven , they learn ! The American millionaire is really a student , through no choice of his own  --  and it seems likely that some day , if he does his homework faithfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police could close speakeasies that sell poisonous liquor , we would favor it . If the police could close all speakeasies , we would favor that . But the police admit that they can not close the speakeasies  --  of which there are now about seventeen thousand . The reason they ca n't do it is that the demand for liquor is constant , and the supply is constant , and hence the sale is virtually constant . The fact that the purblind New York police , without so much as rubbing their eyes , could go into and raid five hundred places in a fortnight is an enlightening commentary on this age of innocence , as well as a pretty good forecast of the immediate future . That the sale of liquor has always been blessed with a certain cooperation on the part of the police , nobody can deny , or wants to . There has been an unavoidable averting of the eyes , due partly to the normal functioning of graft , and partly to the normal human disinclination to kick up a fuss every minute and disrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable and unlovely they are , and lately they have been getting on their feet in a solid business way . XThat the police graft has been is hard to find out , because the police wo n't tell and neither will the proprietors . The only thing known about it is that the consumer pays it , in the price of his drink . Mr. Whalen 's crusades seem to us interesting but doubtful ; they seem to us more spectacular than intelligent . While the ultimate result is difficult to predict , the immediate results are patent : ( 1 ) amount of drinking , same ; ( 2 ) price of liquor , up ; ( 3 ) quality of liquor , worse if anything ; ( 4 ) publicity for the Commissioner , much ; ( 5 ) circulation of the Telegram , up . The only gleam of hope in the whole fiery business is that it may aid the tottering nation to see what a stew we are all in , to the ultimate reconditioning of our Constitubon . Even that seems strangely doubtful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clerk can press a couple of buttons and in , a couple of little electric lights will flash , indicating the seats clearly . Another suggestion to theatre managers : discharge the person now in charge of your box office and hire someone with a quieter spleen . It is no surprise to is that the theatres are having a bad time  --  they eminently deserve it . For some reason which we 've never understood , most theatres go nut of their way to discourage the purchase of tickets by making the operation not only outrageously expensive but unnecessarily disagreeable . OUR attitude toward traffic has changed from the cynical to the statistical . y With little else to amuse us , we have invented a game . The object is to see how many southbound buses we can pass , walking from Fifty-seventh Street to Forty-fifth Street on Fifth Avenue . Our most recent record is thirty-two buses . We publish it on the chance that it may interest the Fifth Avenue Coach Company , or the Traffic Department , or President Coolidge . The previous high record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifty-ninth . The combined stabstics ought to interest someone . Not only is vehicular travel in this district preposterous , but pedestrian travel has to be undertaken in the face of the poisonous gas exuded from the obviously ineffectual common carriers . Titles VICE-PRESIDENT DAWES attended a banquet given for a group of visiting Britishers by the Commercial Cluh of Chicago , of which he has limg been an officer . Next him at the table of honor was one of the foreign guests , Sir Charles Something . Shortly after being seated the latter essayed conversation . " It must he a great responsibility , " he said , " tn he vice-president of a great club like this . " Scotty Etcher HE device on the radiator cap of - 1-  an automobile which may usually be seen standing before a studio in the East Forties is a silver Scottish terrier . The machine belongs to Miss Marguerite-Kirmse , who owes much to the breed . A few years ago a Scotty shared his dog biscuit with her  --  or at any rate did n't object when she reached down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady was very low in funds , and hungry . Later the terrier breed  --  with the help of a Victrola needle  --  again came to her rescue , this time in a more substantial way . One day she idly etched a Scotty on a copper plate with the phonograph needle , and showed the result to a dealer . The latter h  --  came enthusiastic . She then began to make a career of this art and last rear sold more etchings than any other artist . She has made an appreciable fortune from them , and also from those small bronze figures of Scotties which are to he seen in shops on the avenues -- she models most of these and they sell rapidly ( one dealer now wires his to a table because people had been carrying them off ) . Perhaps the artist 's best-known work , however , is the etching of two police dogs on a snowy hilltop , a piece which is becoming one of those standard dog studies r very hod y buys . Miss Kirmse is English and came here fourteen years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professional harpist , but found it hard going , playing in churches and giving lessons fur small amounts . Between whiles she spent much time at the Central Park and Bronx Zoos sketching animals , but her own Scotties -- she has always owned one or two even in hard times  --  were her favorite models . Her first studies of them caught the pi yolarity of this breed at its highest in New York . Now she brings out a new series of half a dozen etchings twice a year and they sell out almost at once . The only complete collection of her etchings besides the one she owns is that of the Governor of Massachusetts . The Queen of England saw , admired , and bought one of a series . The etcher works long and late at her studio in town but spends her weekends playing with dogs on her farm at Bridgewater , Connecticut , where she is known to the neighbors as Mrs. George W. Cole . The place is overrun with Irish terriers and Airedales and , principally , Scotties . In one corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a female Scottish terrier who , in her day , was the readiest of all Miss Kirmse 's pets to split a biscuit with her mistress or sit for a profile . Encounter L 1L Mr. Whalen , accompanied by  - -  / a civilian aide or friend , was coming down the steps of a squalid tenement in hIlcecker Street , having gone there personally to assist in some Italian murder or something , when a polite captain drove madly up in an automobile . He spoke crisply to the Commissioner and his friend . " You men live here ? " We have been unable to learn whether this captain is one of those " broken " or not . Ex-Governor yd ARLY one I morning a woman who occupiesthe penthouse of a building in Riverside Drive was having breakfast in bed , without a thought in her mind of Coolidge or Congress or politics of any sort , when she heard a scuffling of feet on the roof . Rising and peering out a window she saw Alfred E. Smith , the Democrat , walking about . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had n't been thinking of Smith either . The ex-Governor was there , it developed , to look at a second penthouse on the roof , with the idea of living in it . He did n't lease it because it had thirteen rooms  --  too many . As announced last week , he will live at Twelfth Street and Fifth Avenue in a somewhat smaller apartment . Since he retired from office , the Governor has kept his plans much to himself . He had little to say when he moved into his new offices at 331 Madison Avenue last week . As a matter of fact , they are really not new offices . He has quietly used them for the past five years , without many persons knowing- it . Among the eleven boxes of impedimenta which he brought down with him from Albany were the swivel chair he used up there , an Irish shillalah , a small Jewish charm which he keeps on his desk , and a favorite cuspidor . He has had many offers since he was defeated for the presidency , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university . The chair was to he endowed by a certain wealthy man on the condition that the Governor he the first to occupy it . Mr. Smith refused the honor . Many of those who have approached him wanted him to write articles for publication . Several national magazines asked him to name his own price . However , he is restricting his literary work at this time to a hook to he called " Let 's Look at the Record . " This is partially completed , and has already been contracted for by a publisher who , they say , will pay the author a considerable flat sum in addition to royalties . Pair of Holbcins MR . HENRY GOLDMAN , the hanker , for many years acquired paintings with meticulous care until he possessed one of the finest small collections in existence During all the time he has been collecting his eyesight has been failing , and only recently he had the misfortune to become totally blind . Several months ago he came across an exquisite pair of Holbein miniatures in the gallery of Sir Joseph Duveen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his blindness came and whatever intentions he may have had of purchasing them passed from his mind . Early in December another collector visited the gallery and priced the Holbeins but the dealer said they were not for sale . Mr. Goldman has them now , for on December twenty-fifth Sir Joseph sent them to him as a Christmas present . 1 ' riling on the Trail THE flashy electric sign which belts the Times Building was designed , built , installed , and inaugurated by Mr. Frank C. Reilly , who is responsible for most of the moving , or reading , signs along Broadway , and it is , to date , his most conspicuous achievement . It was to have been ready early on Election Night , but at six o'clock it was n't quite finished , and the engineers sent an emissary to Mr. Ochs , the Times ' owner , to express regrets and say that they hoped to have the thing going by eight . The message-bearer , they say , found Mr. Ochs sitting- disconsolately in a chair , saddened by the trend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started at eight or not . It did , however , get Limier way at that hour , and has been going strong ever since . The sign works thus : The frame which encircles the building and on which the moving letters and words appear is controlled by a smaller rectangular affair in a room on the fourth floor . Through this the letters , made of metal , arc run after being dropped in proper order down a chute . Each letter , as it moves along , passes over myriad metal brushes which are connected with the bulbs on the outside of the About fifteen thousand wires make the connections between the brushes and the bulbs . The latter light up for only one forty-second of a second . Special lamps are required for the purpose , as a lingering glow would blur the words . The machinery which runs the things makes a terrific , clacking noise . About eighteen years ago , Mr. Reilly was an electrician with a street-railway system . He had been working on trick devices in his spare time , and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those which show ginger-ale flowing out of a bottle , or tooth-paste oozing from a tube . Being on Broadway so much he established a considerable connection with the theatre . He has written sketches for musical comedies with more or less success and has dabbled in producing plays , among his ventures being " Pickwick " and the recent " A Play Without a Name . " He works in a big , confused office near Times Square with a collection of autographed photographs about the walls . Right over his desk , in honor position , arc pictures of Al Smith , John McCormack , the Prince of Wales , and Father Duffy . He has invented a new type of wrench which simplifies the assembling of automobiles in factories . He keeps a number of these in a drawer , shiny and new , and presents them to callers . Service M11/0 things happened in the book-/. stores this week which we think worthy of setting down . A man , a modest collector who likes to get all the editions of books he is interested in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , " said the young lady , " we would n't have that ; you 'd have to go to a drugstore . " At a smaller shop a West Point cadet incluired for " The Case of Sergeant Grischa . " " All out , " said the storekeeper . " Give you Sergeant York , though . " In the Book AFELLOW who had spent much time alone began to investigate the telephone book , and made several interesting discoveries . He found that not only are Athos , Aramis , and Porthos listed in the directory , but that Alexander Dumas is there himself . Investigation , however , led to disappointment . The names of the Three Musketeers merely designate separate entrances to an apartment house in the Bronx , and Mr. Dumas is prosaically in the insurance business , unaware , probably , that the Musket eers are in the book with him . A major find was the fine lot of Winterbottoms on page 1598 , all in the undertaking business or some calling allied to it . Carleton , Jas . E. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy most of a column . There are even more Santinis in one line of work , the moving-van and storage-warehouse business ? thirty-nine of the family in all being listed . More names begin with " Sch " than with any other three-letter group  --  about thirteen hundred ; the president of the American Association for the Advancement of Atheism , the Mr. Smith who was devilling Mr. John Roach Straton sometime back , is listed as " Smith Chas atheist ; " there is a man actually named Butinsky ; there is a Mr. Valentine Kiss . It seems that the phone company never questions any name or symbol which a subscriber wishes to use . It was n't even curious when the Messrs . Zzyn and Zzyz assumed those names in order to he last in the book  --  the history of that was that Mr. Nicholas Putnam took the name Zzyn to be last and was last until Mr. Lewis Browne won , with Zzyz , the distinction , such as it is . In the same manner the lintel Majestic is listed first  --  it prefixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any title with his name which he likes , without showing his right to it . Recently there was a protest against women being allowed to append R. N. ( registered nurse ) without investigation , but the telephone company disclaimed responsibility for right and wrong in such matters . WHILE gleaning the foregoing , we were reminded of a secret we came upon a year or two ago which was carefully kept by quite a group of people with a sense of humor ; and since Orhal See has passed from the telephone directory , it can he revealed . Orhal See was the Mail de telephone for one Mr. Wood Cowan , an artist . Mr. Cowan went to the phone company 's offices one day several years ago to see about getting his phone service restored . He had gone out of town and had subleased his apartment , phone and all , to a man who ran up a big long-distance hill and did n't pay it . The phone company refused to restore service until this account was settled  --  at least the roan to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the Counter another clerk approached him and asked him what he wished . " I wish a phone , " said the latter , crossly . " What is your name ? " asked the clerk . " What ? " said Mr. Cowan , who had n't heard . " I must have your name , " said the man . " Oh , I see , " said Cowan. " 0 . I. See , " repeated the clerk , " and what is your first name , Mr. See ? " Mr. Cowan was surprised , not to say taken aback , but it seemed as if he were going to get a phone , and he tried to think up a first name for See but had difficulty thinking of one beginning with " 0 . " He invented one , " Orhal , " and Orhal See he became , for under that name he got his phone service restored , in a sort of epic of confusion , and under that name his friends phoned him during the life of at least three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get round , before long , to John Wanamaker . ( We feel safe in assuming that about anybody . ) In addition to the facts that Mr. Wanamaker himself always wrote the little pieces which appeared over his name in his advertisements , never took a drink , never went to the theatre , and never smoked , we can offer one further item of Wanamakiana . Just this : Although Mr. AVanarnaker was sternly sober and a total abstainer , he had a nice old servant who was n't . In his odd moments , the good servitor , named Oscar tippled freely and well , but so innocent was his employer in this matter that he never suspected it . One day Mr. Vanamaker was seated pleasantly before the fire , thinking about life and abstinence , when Oscar entered the room , hearing a glass of milk for the master . The several people present im-mediately saw that Oscar 's physical condition was perilous ; their first concern was whether he would be able to make the long journey over to the fireplace , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . Oscar progressed , grimly , in a grapevine course to his master 's side , handed him the milk , and collapsed on the floor . " Dear , dear , " said Mr. Wanamaker , distressed , " it 's awfully hot in this room for poor Oscar . " Dancing Days BRYANT HALL , the old brick building in Sixth Avenue opposite Bryant Park , is a landmark , and it has its rewards for the visitor who ventures through its high old swinging doors . It contains one ballroom and four assembly halls , which are used for such things as theatrical rehearsals , union dances , and Slovak weddings . The dance-routine people patronize it a great deal , and almost any time of the day or night the thumping of half a dozen pianos and the noise of shuffling feet may he heard on one or all of its three upper floors . The place has lost caste in the present century , but in the seventies and eighties it was the scene of balls of glamour . The building was put up shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A gentleman named Trenov conducted a polite dancing school there , and literary societies met quietly in one or another of the rooms . In changing hands a number of times ( Horn Hardart have it now on a long-term lease ) , the building was thrown open finally to a welter of activities , and such bodies as the Republican County Committee were granted space for their deliber-ations , while axe-handle ma- kers and the like chose one of the halls for their annual dances . Sometimes bedlam reigns . We go in occasion ally , at a quiet hour , for rest and meditation . An old wall mirror is just inside the door , and wide stairs with worn treads lead abruptly upward to the first assembly floor . A man sits in a cage at the head of the stairs , regarding everyone with suspicion , for men who get chilly sitting in Bryant Park try sometimes to slip by . A big sign forbids loitering and a blackboard proclaims where rehearsals are being held most of the producers in town use the hall . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second floor , you will find an old barroom , with its abandoned dark-wood bar . It has n't been used fur years except by spiders , and is a sad place . Placards and programs of forgotten events may he picked up here and there , such as one we found announcing the annual reception of the Spaulding Literary Union , Friday evening , April 6 , 1888 , tickets one dollar . Wandering into the gloom of one of the unoccupied flag-draped ballrooms , you may have a vision of a heyday sixty years ago when people moved smartly about in the figures of the lancers , Then from somewhere above someone yells at Joe to give ' em the music , a piano starts playing , and a line of unseen chorus girls begins to stomp.
