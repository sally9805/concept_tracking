Street car operators and manufacturers of their equipment , who were holding their yearly convention in Cleveland last week , were delighted with the words of their chief speaker-Owen D. Young , lawyer Chairman of the General Electric Co . His company sells service to electric power &; light companies , which in turn sell current to street railways . <P> Few car companies have made money since the War . Cost of equipment and wages has gone up ; motor cars have decoyed passengers and , by crowding thoroughfares , have increased cost of running cars . <P> Many companies by honest explanation of their money troubles or by aid of politicians have succeeded in getting local fares increased-but not enough to pay good dividends on their capital stock . <P> The situation first perturbed Mr. Young , then aroused him . When he is aroused , he speaks sharply . And sharply did he speak last week : <P> " Certainly the farmer in 1928 does not expect to feed his horses half the oats he did in 1914 and get the same service from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is demanding where it still insists on the 5 fare . If a 5 fare is insisted upon where on an average it costs 8 to transport , why talk about private capital doing that job ? It simply can not be done . Nor can it be done any cheaper by public capital , but we can tax the community instead of the individual rider to make up the difference . " <P> Because whatever Mr. Young says is heeded by businessmen , the street car operators at Cleveland last week hoped to get all their communities to permit fares increased to between 8 and 11 a ride . <P> The American Electric Railway Association has made its meeting &; exposition at Cleveland a yearly affair . One attraction is that the Cleveland Railway Co. has the privilege of raising ( or lowering ) fares to provide ample money for dividends on its capital stock and for experiments in street railway operations . Practically every other company in the country is bound by franchise always to charge fixed fares . Cleveland thus is the inspiration and hope of such companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely of aluminum . It is 25% to 33% lighter than ordinary cars , and so cheaper to operate .
