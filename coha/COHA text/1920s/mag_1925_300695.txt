Early last week Premier Paul Painlev submitted to the Finance Committee of the Chamber a definite plan for the fiscal rehabilitation of France . There ensued seven days of picturesque wrangling and wirepulling , which the French press characterized almost unanimously as " scandalous . " As the week closed , the Painlev bill emerged momentarily to public view in a revised and amended form . Only Le Bon Dieu was aware what further and possibly indefinite modifications it might undergo before passing from the Committee into the Chamber itself . <P> The Original Bill may be succinctly described as a tax on everything and everybody . The proceeds would be used to feed a sinking fund for the retirement of the French domestic debt . Specific provisions : 1 ) A head tax of 20 francs ( 80c ) a year on everyone in France . 2 ) A tax on all " real property " amounting in general to one and a half times the income derived from it in 1925 , and payable either in a lump sum or in installments over 14 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-half the average yearly profits for the past three years , and payable in 14 yearly installments. 4 ) A tax upon all securities* and investments , providing that for 14 years 15% of their yield shall be paid to the Government . 5 ) A heavy increase in the income tax , especially in the higher brackets , with severe fines for tax dodgers. 6 ) A tax of 8% on household goods and personal property valued in excess of 50,000 francs ( $2,000 ) payable in a lump sum or in installments over 14 years. + A detailed and extensive sketch envisioned the proposed Sinking Fund as functioning separately from the regular fiscal machinery of the Government ; and a clause was inserted to the effect that its administrators or the Finance Minister should be permitted to resort to a limited inflation of the French currency in case of emergency . <P> The seven days were spent by M. Painlev in endeavoring to parry the efforts of M. Leon Blum and the Socialists to force a definite expression of the " capital levy " ( TIME , Nov. 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government is " supported " by the Radical-Socialists , the so-called cartel des Gauches , nominally headed by M. Herriot . Actually M. Blum split off with his Socialists a fortnight ago and had the Government at his mercy , because without his votes Premier Painlev could not command a majority in the Chamber . <P> In these circumstances , M. Blum flatly demanded a direct levy on capital instead of a 14-year tax on " income . " M. Painlev dared not yield , because it was considered certain that the conservative Senate would kill any such measure even if it passed the Chamber . Still M. Blum insisted . He wanted a " capital levy " inserted " on principle , " though the Senate should tear it up . <P> M. Painlev , backed by President Doumergue , then defied the Socialists and vowed that he would throw his measure into the Chamber as it stood . Said he , " I will not yield . I will fall on the field of battle . " Thereupon he went to bed .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
