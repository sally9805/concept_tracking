They were 171 strong and represented 39 States , but they did not call themselves " We , the People . " They called themselves simply the Socialist Party , a party of protest including much that passes for innocent insurgence on the outskirts of the two big parties . They held the first national convention of the 1928 season , last week in a Finnish hall on the unfashionable upper end of Fifth Avenue , Manhattan . <P> Victor L. Berger was there , the unique Socialist member of Congress . He could point to no legislative victories and lamented the defection of all but three Congressmen , including himself and New York 's vociferous La Guardia , from what was once a bloc of ten House " radicals . " Mr. Berger , as chairman of the party 's executive committee , promised a light-wines- &-beer; plank in the Socialist platform . <P> Other Socialists present were James H. Maurer , the Pennsylvania laborite ; Daniel W. Hoan , Milwaukee 's mayor ; Joseph W. Swarts , candidate for Governor of Ohio ; Norman Thomas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian minister , but left the pulpit for the press ( The World Tomorrow , pacifist monthly ) . Perennially a candidate for something or other , perennially defeated , Mr. Thomas , happy champion of lost causes , was " mentioned for the Presidency " in the pre-convention gossip . So was Pennsylvania 's Maurer . <P> Morris Hillquit , the Latvian-born Manhattan lawyer whose political history is that of the U. S. Socialist party since 1888 ( when he was 19 ) , made a " keynote " speech attacking the corrupt , reactionary Republicans and Democrats . " Only a party like ours , " he said , " can be relied on to cleanse this immense cesspool of political corruption . " <P> The Socialist national convention continued its deliberations . <P> Louis Waldman , onetime Assemblyman of New York , rose and nominated Norman Thomas to be Socialist candidate for the Presidency of the U. S. Cameron King of California cried his swift second to the nomination . The Convention shouted , cheered , applauded . Some , throaty with emotion , sang the Internationale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nomination , said that James H. Maurer ought to have been the party 's candidate . <P> Mr. Maurer , however , was nominated for Vice President , by William Van Essen of Pennsylvania , with Morris Hillquit seconding . <P> <P> People who like coincidences were pleasantly shocked to learn that nominee Thomas was born in Marion , Ohio , in 1884 , the year that Warren Gamaliel Harding became a cub reporter on the Marion Star . Should the Socialists do any electoral " cleansing " this autumn , Mr. Thomas will doubtless be sung by Socialist poets as a savior whose birth was portentous , if not miraculous . <P> A graduate ( 1911 ) of Union Theological School , Mr. Thomas used to assist at the Brick Presbyterian Church , Fifth Avenue and 37th Street , Manhattan . Few strikes of any size in or near Manhattan , few free speech fights or Sacco-Vanzetti trials , are conducted without his assistance . In 1924 he was a candidate for Governor of New York .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
