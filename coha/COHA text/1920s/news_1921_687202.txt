txt A proposal by the United States Government for an arrangement of annual international conferences is expected to be placed before the armament and Far Eastern conference when it reaches the discussion of Article X. of the Chinese de ' mends . Article X. , which some think is an auspicious numerical designation , reads Provision to be made for future conferences to be held from time to time for the discussion of international questions relative to the Pacific and the Far East , as a basis for the determination of common policies of the signatory powers In relation thereto . Although this proposal was put forward by the Chinese , it was not , as was learned authoritatively today , , purely a Chiness.proporial , but. , " a general proposal . " The fact is that it came from the United States Government . Inasinuch at it is likely that a naval agreethent Will be effected before the end of the discussion of the Far East , and inasmuch as Article X. la the last of the Chinese demands , it is apparent that any discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural , toward the end of the conference . If the Administration carries out its expressed intention to call in other powers to invite them to sanction what th'e conference has done , an excellent opportunity will be presented for putting forward a definite proposal of annual conferences . In British , French and Italian circles , as well as in Belgian , Chinese and Japanese circles , there was a sentiment today distinctly favorable to the Harding proposal . However , as a British spokesman pointed out , foreign diplomats could not express any official opinion on a project of which the conference has no formal knowledge . They do not know exactly what the President intends to work for because he has not made that known . The allied nations have a material interest in keeping the League of Nations going , and they will wait to learn the difference between the proposed annual conferences and the assemblies ? of the League before going on record . While Great Britain and France would probably be willing to have the projected conferences meet every year in Washington , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Government will make a proposal that might be open to the intimation that America was trying to make Washington the capital of the world . A Time for Compurison . As soon as the Harding proposal is definitely on the table , and as soon as France , for instance , suggests that the next conference be held in Paris , the American public may be in a better position to compare the relative merits of a. conference of forty-eight nations , sitting in Geneva and discussing land disarmament , for example , and a conference of the same forty-eight nations , plus the United States , sitting in Paris , a few hundred miles away , and discussing the same thing . Whether the only difference will be the absence of the United States from one and its presence at another can be seen only after Mr. Harding makes plain his plans . There was considerable discussion to . day in Washington of a report that President Harding had in mind a " loom 's " association of nations than the League ; that there would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take part which were directly interested in the problem under discussion . For instance , when the conference would be discussing white slavery , only those nations would take part that had white slavery problems . A weak point in the Idea that the number of nations . interested in any one problem , is limited is well shown by President Harding a intention to call to Washington a large number of other nations to sanction what the five assembled here have done or the nine have done , as the case may be . At the Paris Peace Conference there was a prolonged discussion of the point whether an association would work without rules and regulations and provisions for sanctions . It was unanimously decided by some fifteen nations or so that enforcement of world laws could be had only if It cost something to break them . It was recalled that Germany did many things which she was bound by " gentlemen 's agreements " as well as by treaties , pot to do . ** was felt tho , t if there existed in ' the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a non-covenant league seemed to presume , there was little use of a ' league to better international relations by the establishment of a standard of what was honorable . Will Face Same Problems as League . Whatever may be the details of the plan of the American Administration , there is bound to be a certain resemblance in character between an Assembly of nations under the Harding plan and an assembly under the league plan . There will be the same nations , with the same aspirations , with the same fears , with the same quarrels . Participating in either discussion , the American Government would naturally be called on to take a stand with regard to other nations ' problems , just as now at Washington , it can not , if it would , escape voicing its opinion in the submarine debate between France and England , a debate based primarily on their political rivalry on the continent , regardless of what aspect Secretary Hughes would desire to give the discussion . Whether the sovereignty of America would be more imperiled or whether the United States would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nations at Geneva , or an assembly of nations at some other capital , is a question for which it is to be supposed the Harding Administration will have an answer . That answer , however , is not yet publicly known . The larger foreign nations represented here thought they saw an advantage in such conferences as the present one , because of the small number of participants making decisions easier . They have been much annoyed at Geneva by the fact that recognition of the sovereignty of each nation represented , even the smallest , made necessary the urranimity which has made it impos:Able to act upon many questions affecting conflicting interests of different States . But if Harding intends to invite all the nations interested in international problems to the projected meetings than a nice problem is presented of how to deal with the smaller nations . Thus the inauguration of the proposed system of world conclaves confronts exactly the same technical problems that faced the makers of the league at Paris . They tried to settle them by adoption of the covenant . Harding , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaits it .
