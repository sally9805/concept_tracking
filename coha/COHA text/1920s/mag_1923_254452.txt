Clive Bell , distinguished English critic and pontiff of modernism , declares cubism is in decline . It has served its purpose of freeing art from conventional restraints , and is in danger of becoming itself a mere convention . <P> Enrico Caruso , clever caricaturist and sculptor of some merit , left a valuable art collection , which is being sold at the American Art Galleries , Manhattan . The collection includes Limoges enamels , Egyptian and Roman glass , ancient Greek sculpture , snuff boxes , watches . <P> Howard Chandler Christy , commissioned recently to paint the portrait of President Harding has been asked to paint the portraits of six other Presidents of the United States : the two Adams , Monroe , Van Buren , Polk , Garfield . These portraits will hang in the salons of the " President Fleet " of the United States Shipping Board-which will carry Mr. Christy 's fame even farther than American magazines have carried it already .
