txt Luis N. Morones , Minister of Industry , Commerce and Labor , addressing last night an audience which filled the Esperanza Theatre , charged that the Knights of Columbus of the United States were seeking to bring about immediate intervention by the American Government in Mexico . Catholics , he said , have resorted to the expedient , which he termed an old one , of providing an International conflict . " The Government of Mexico . " declared Sefior Morones , " will not tremble before the Vatican . The Roman Pontiff does not govern Mexico and , if he did , we would have gone back 100 years . " The utterances of Sefior Morones , one of President Calles 's most enthusiastic supporters and the most powerful figure in Mexican organized labor , were made in the course of a debate with Luis Mier y ' reran , a Mexico City , student , who , Sefior Morones asserted , was delegated by the Catholics to represent the Church because they wanted it to appear that the youth of Mexico are on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State . Government Firmness Seen . What Sefior Morones said  --  and he could not have been more emphatic was interpreted today by all Mexico City as additional proof that in the present crisis the Government has no intention of accepting any compromise , but will go forward with its program ' regardless of protests from any source , local or alien . The Catholic Church , Sefior Morones declared , has never been and is not now the friend of the working classes . Nowhere is this better illustrated , he asserted , than in the Republic of Mexico . Replying , Sefior Mier charged that Sefior Morones had challenged the Catholics to take up arms in defense of their cause , which , he insisted , wa4 a move that has'received no conSideration by the Catholics , who , he said , . have yet to be defeated on the field of reason . It was evident to all in the big theatre that a large majority of the audience was with the Government 's champion , the applause amounting at times to practically an ovation for Senor MoronesThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the Mexican Federation of Labor . The Catholic Church , he said , had never shown any interest in the welfare of the Mexican workers , but had , on the other hand , sought to keep the workers in ignorance for the benefit of the landowners , who were strong Catholics . " ZrotectIon for the workers ! " exClaimed Senor Morones , and , his partisans gave him an ovation as he added : " Yes , they had them working from sunrise to sunset and , according to the Church , that is what the Lord made ' , them for . " Clergy Are Attacked . The Church , said Sefior Morones , had used its influence with Mexican mothers to force the children to attend Catholic schools so that as workers they would not be rebellious ' against their employers . When the revolution first started , the speaker declared , the priests , especially in the City of Canaan. , warned the workers not to join the revolution and citing the example of Christ , who turned the other cheek , urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining the revolution , which was started to better the lot of the laboring man . " How many of you revolutionists , " continued Senor Morones , " will remember that you received in the heat of the campaign letters from your mothers , wives and daughters , counseled by the priests , begging you to desert the revolutionary movement ? " The priests from their pulpits condemned the revolution . They did not study whether the public had any reaeon to seek to liberate themselves from their oppressors . They continued to try to control , through the souls of women , the destinies of men . " Here followed a short exposition of the Mexican labor movement . Seller Morones charged that the clergy had acted as spies for the reactionary element during the revolution . " There may be . " he said , " those who are honorable and dignified who are followers of the Roman Catholic creed , but they are very few . " Denies Youth Backs Church . He recalled that as a youth he had for five years worked in the ChurcU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years , he declared , he witnessed things he did not care to discuss publicly . " You and I , " the speaker said , turning to Senor Mier , " were brought to the Church , carried by our.fath  --  ra , but you did not see what I in five long years saw , and that is the reason why you preserve your faith . I lost mine , and that is why I am here to defend the truth . " You are young , and sooner or later you will join our ranks . They have sent you here because they wish to compromise your youth , because they pretend the youth is with them . " That is untrue . The youths are in the revolutionary ranks . They are with the free men who preserve their belief . You believe in God . We all do . The campaign is not against God , but it is against the pharisees . " K. of C. Are Attacked . At this point Senor Morones referred to the Knights of Columbus convention last week in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted calling for immediate intervention by the United States . He recalled that a short time ago Senor Herrera y Lasso , a Mexico City lawyer , had pleaded the cause of the Church on the basis of patriotism , and yet , said Senor Morones , " they are using the Catholic press to attack the Mexican Government , and these are they who protest love for their country . " The Vatican . said Senor Morones , has advised Catholics not to respect any law which is against the interest of the clergy . " Do you believe , " he asked , " that the Government of Mexico will tremble before the Vatican ? No , the Pope does not govern Mexico . If he did , we would have gone back 100 years . " Our laws have been made , and they will be complied with not only by the revolutionists but by every one . " You will recall the great British strike involving 8,000,000 men , 8,000,000 families . When these millions risked their future , do you know what these fanatics , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offered themselves as strike-breakers while the miners were dying of hunger and still continued to strike . " That is the work the Church has done in favor of the workingman . This not only shows lack of help on the part of the Catholic Church but proves that the Church ie always against the labor movement . This is because they believe international labor is a menace to the Vatican . " Catholic . Orator Replies . In reply , Senor Mier declared that it was an indisputable fact that the Church had no liberty in Mexico . " The Catholic Church in Mexico , " he asserted , " is again living in the catacombs . It has been denied the right to think in Article 3 of the Constitution , which even prohibits it from teaching . " How can you demand that we comply with this law ? Slaves may plead and ask that their chains ' be broken . " As a matter of fact , argued Senor Mier , since 190a the Catholic Church in Mexico had favored the cause of labor , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican revolutionary movement . In the face of the facts , he declared , Sefior Morones 's assertions about the attitude of the Church toward labor would not stand careful scrutiny . Senor Mier was brief in his reply , and neutrals in the audience noted bow sparing was the applause given to him compared with the demonstration accorded Senor Morones.
