yOU can not lecture in America for four or five years without realizing that the visiting English lecturer is by no means a universally popular figure . Indeed , you find that there are some circles , notably the more literary , and the more serious in New York , where the fact of being an English lecturer is a definite handicap to establishing friendly relations . You may be deceived for a time by the number of tea parties to which you are invited and by the amount of printed matter highly complimentary to you provided for public edification , but sooner or later you must find out . The revelation probably does not come through anything you hear said about yourself , but through what you hear about other English lecturers , not at public teas , but in private , where people speak as cat to cat ; and what you hear about them gradually makes you more and more uneasy about what they hear about you . I propose to analyze some of this ill-feeling and to defend my fellowlecturers ; and in doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I frankly admit that I am accusing them and myself as well . We do behave badly , we are open to censure , as much and perhaps more than any other group of human beings ; and , as always , part of the fault lies in our heredity , our nature , and part in our environment , that is in America itself . There is , of course , part of this dislike for visiting lecturers which may be discounted at once as trivial and uninteresting . It is the dislike which is naturally felt by natives when they see crowds listening to and staring at speakerssimply because they are foreign and a little exotic . I have often wondered what an English nightingale , perched at liberty on a tree in Regent 's Park , must think when it sees hundreds of people going through turnstiles and paying at the London zoological gardens to hear some gaudy South American parrot screech and chatter in a cage . Is it content that no hungry generations tread it down , or would it like to be paid for singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but no one can blame it nor the American literary man for disliking a foreign competitor , whose strong suit is not talent , nor grace , but simply the fact of being foreign . You pay a nickel less at a sandwich shop for an American cheese sandwich than for one built of Swiss cheese ; and I always buy the former , not merely to save the nickel , but out of a sentiment of sympathy for the American cheese thus slighted , though its merit is certainly equal to that of its rival . But when we have discounted this very natural source of irritation , this well-founded and most excusable form of jealousy , we are left with a truly formidable stream of accusations and criticisms , persisting despite enthusiastic audiences , increasing engagements , unstinted hospitality , and loud-voiced publicity , following the English lecturer around the country . It is , as I have said , not so much what be hears about himself , but what he hears about the others , which disturbs him out of his well-satisfied sense of popularity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE VISITING LECTURER 563 the cause of Anglo-American friendship is really served by all this talking ; whether it would not be better if the British government were to place an embargo on the export of all subjects not palpably deaf and dumb ; whether English lecturers do not serve the same evil function as a certain type of American tourist in Paris and elsewhere . He wonders too why pressure is not brought to bear on the American government to put a high tariff on foreign talkers , seeing that current political dogma believes that the best way of encouraging local industry is to put a prohibitive tax on the foreign product . And then perhaps he stops wondering and begins to argue , to defend and to counter-charge . And at this point he writes this article . II Why is the English lecturer in vacuo often unpopular with nice intelligent people ? What are the charges ? It is stated against the English lecturer that his manners are abominable ; and at once it must be admitted that some English lecturers are sometimes disgracefully ill-mannered . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories lying around for the evilly disposed to collect and embellish . The scene was a large room in which were seated after dinner half a dozen or so Americans and two English ladies , one a lecturer , the other her companion . The lecturer had put through a long-distance call , charged up to her hostess , to an unknown cousin who had invited the two of them to his country house . " I do n't think , " she said to her companion , as she laid down the receiver , " that we shall like him ; he sounds very American ! " The half dozen Americans continued to sit there , laughing inwardly , for the incident was only one of a succession of like incidents with these particular specimens . You could not have a better example of a certain naive category of the accusations levelled at the English lecturer and his alleged illconcealed contempt for his very kind hosts . Can it be defended ? It can not quite be defended , perhaps , but it can be explained ? but even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appalling things said and done by an enfant terrible ; and it is as an enfant terrible that the English lecturer abroad can best be explained and even defended . For the English lecturer is rather like a child suddenly freed from all sorts of restrictions , with the result that this freedom sometimes goes to his head . Watch a well-brought-up child at a birthday tea ; freed of the rule " bread and butter first , " he will almost certainly eat too much cake . Or watch a child who has usually been kept in his place by adults ; some grownup allows him to take liberties with him , and quite soon the child has snatched the proffered inch of friendship and taken a mile on his own . Now that is the psychological state in which every English lecturer constantly finds himself in America ; freed from restrictions and rules which have supported his character and behavior hitherto , he very soon loses his head and becomes a nuisance , and he does things which he would never do in his own country , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment at the English lecturer in his native habitat . He is usually a person of very slight importance ; he may have written a promising book , or been a member of Parliament , or even done a little capable scientific research ; but ninety-nine out of a hundred of his fellow-countrymen are getting through life happily and healthily without ever having heard of him . True , there are exceptions : greater lights , suns not satellites , who venture now and again to shine upon these shores ; but as a general rule these prove inaudible and , after pocketing large fees for whispering variegated nothings to the front row of their audiences , return to their native land , and America knows them no more . Of these we need not speak , as they are a class apart . The ordinary English leeturer who makes a habit and a profession of his tours alone concerns us . Not only do ninety-nine out of a hundred know and care nothing about him , but most of the small minority who do , disagree , disapprove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly on all suitable occasions . No one is ashamed of not having read his books , no one pretends to understand his scientific experiments when they have not had the necessary training , nobody agrees with his politics when they really belong to another party . And then be comes to America , and everything is done to make him have a colossal opinion of himself : people buy his books in the morning and know the names of the characters by the afternoon ; what he has to say about science just thrills them ; his political descriptions assume the proportions of an apostolic message . " We have the greatest admiration for Ramsay MacDonald , " says the lady in a smalltown club in Wisconsin to the labor party lecturer , and then later , " I am sure that nobody in your audience would dream of voting for a man like La Follette . " All this , done for politeLess , naturally makes a man conceited , and how can it fail to make him rude , seeing that rudeness is the fruit of the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good manners than to be taken as omniscient . That is one of the first restrictions removed from these poor innocent children abroad ? the restriction of disagreement . There is also the restriction of poverty and material discomfort ; these drop off them instantly . They find themselves feted , cherished , entertained by people who are willing and able to surround them with undreamed-of comfort . For the asking , all sorts of luxurious treatment is given them , and quite soon they are complaining of the minutest little details of the arrangement of their bed or bath ; having swallowed camels galore in their own country , in America they very soon strain at a gnat . An English lecturer who stayed for weeks the guest of a very wealthy and kindly lady , went about saying , " Well , you would expect comfort there , but do you know I had to get out of bed to turn out the light " ; while another complained that where he was staying there was one bathroom between two bedrooms serving them both . One is surprised at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers that in his own house in England there is probably only one bathroom to the whole establishment , and that at the end of a chilly corridor , with one bath towel to last out the week . True , it is surprising that an educated man should complain of his host 's bathroom at any time , but in these cases an enormously heightened standard of living and a bottomless hospitality destroy all sense of proportion , all sense of decency . Having been given so much , the spoiled child loses his landmarks and does not know where his demands should stop . Here is another instance : a well-known English publicist was asked to lecture at a certain club , and inquiries were made as to his fee . He accepted the invitation but declined the fee , asking only that his expenses should be paid . The generous fellow arrived with his wife several days before the lecture and immediately complained of the rooms in his hotel . They were moved up higher , but without satisfying him , until , as a last effort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was across the Canadian border ? and there they stayed after the lecture was over for a full week . The hotel bill far exceeded anything in the way of a fee ever paid in the club 's history . And yet the publicist went home , wrote a most appreciative book on America , and regards himself as one of the strongest links in the chain of Anglo-American good will . He simply lost his head , like a child taking not only the proffered inch of friendship , but a mile or so more on his own . IH I do not , however , propose to publish an anthology of regrettable incidents AN APOLOGY FOR THE VISITING LECTURER 565 such as these to be taken down and used in evidence against all English lecturers whatsoever . Nor will I waste time , like a medieval monk with plenty of years before him , in an attempt to rebut the general accusation ; in pointing out that this is not proof that English lecturers are bad-mannered , but simply evidence to be weighed against other evidence to the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like accusation ; in deprecating all attempts to argue from the particular to the general , I must take a shorter cut and affirm that if the manners of English visitors are admittedly bad , then it is to a large extent the fault of their American hosts . We have already seen that America corrupts the good manners of English lecturers by removing the restrictions which limited their behavior on the other side of the Atlantic , by contradicting them too little and by giving them too good a time , by demanding , positively demanding , to be treated as an enfant terrible treats unfortunate strangers ; but America does not stop at these methods . She insists further on taking away from him the English lecturer 's ultimate prop , that valuable asset , so unjustly ridiculed , " British Reserve . " The skill with which the lecturer 's reserve is undermined is nothing short of diabolical . For the English lecturer would like nothing better than always to be both polite and sincere ; and the only way in which you can safeguard both these virtues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and above all never to ask personal questions nor answer them . Suppose , for example , a man enters a house for the very first time and his hostess asks him , " How do you like my carpet ? " The American knows that this is just a formality like two ants touching each other 's heads and passing on , or like any question about health or any statement about the weather ; he , therefore , says , " I think it 's just the cutest thing , " or " I 'm simply crazy about it " and passes on to the next conversational gambit . The Englishman genuinely believes that his personal opinion has been asked , and after due consideration says , " I hate imitation Axminsters " or " I prefer polished boards , " and the next English lecturer will hear that he has been complaining of the furniture in his host 's house . I do not suggest that it is always or often my lady 's carpet that causes the trouble , but it may be any one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , the family heating system , the small-town high school or insane asylum , prohibition , the American Constitution ; it is all one , Englishmen find it difficult to say , " I think the American Constitution is simply the cutest thing I ever heard of " or " I 'm just crazy about your insane asylum , " and in consequence they are always getting into trouble . It would not help him to have read Bryce , or all the text . books on psychiatry and asylum construction ; for it is not an opinion based on knowledge that is required , but an emotion attuned to the people who ask him these silly questions . He is asked constantly for his opinion upon things about which his opinion is unprintable ; but even this is not the worst , for he is asked about things about which his opinion is sublimely worthless . And what can be a greater strain on good manners than to be treated as if you were omniscient ? Then again , the English lecturer is unfairly trapped by another notoriously common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we love you to talk about us ; it does not matter how much you criticize so long as you do n't stop talking about us . " If that is meant to apply to all Americans , why it is a cunning , thumping lie , contrived to entrap the enfant terrible , the innocent abroad , to double him up , and drag him down and damn his soul alive . The truth is that the Englishman , asked his opinion on anything , and taking the question seriously , is as often as not doomed forever ; for not only may he not criticize , far less may he approve , and least of all , may he have no opinion at all . Just look at what happened to Charles Dickens , the great if not the first of English visiting lecturers . He said that from his own personal observation there was a great present , and if customs did not change , a great future for the American cuspidor industry . He has not been forgiven until this day . Why he said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could change it , as he had changed poor houses , by saying it ; how little he knew the forces against which he was contesting . I have had to conduct personally a chewinggum count on a square yard of sidewalk on Michigan Avenue in order to convince one Chicagoan that the end product of the Wrigley building finds itself deposited indecently and in public from time to time . But you must not mention the thing to your audiences ; for , as one public notice puts it , " Spitting is UnAmerican . " On the other hand your English lecturer must be careful how he praises anything , for that is almost as dangerous as criticism . When you are feeling really enthusiastic about America , and lost in admiration for its people , learn to keep silent . Thus , if you are thrilled by the vitality and energy all around you , by the wonderful way in which Americans organize to get what they want , keep silent , otherwise you will he contradicted : " Vitality ! why it 's simply nerves ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to prevent us ever having the time to think . " And just try saying that to you New York is the most beautiful contemporary city , especially coming iu from the sea ; not only will your audience assume you are laughing at them , but you will be taking out of their very mouths the favorite remark west of Poughkeepsie , south of Newark , and north of Rye , " New York is not America . " If to criticize or to praise is equally dangerous , surely it is safe to have no opinion at all ? It is not safe , it is fatal . You will he asked , throughout your tour , twice a day , what you think of the Prince of Wales . Do not attempt to tell the truth . It is virtually impossible for an American to conceive that days pass without your ever thinking of him at all ; do not say that you never met him ; say that he is cute , or if the girl says so first , agree with her without a pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question in America , is in the same position as the famous one known to chess players where the pieces are arranged in a certain way and your opponent says , " You may take black or white and say you will win , lose , or draw , and whatever you say will be wrong . " And this is why it is so gross of Americans to deny the English lecturer his native breastplate , reserve . IV Worse than to be rude is to be contemptuous of those from whom you accept kindness ; and this black vice is imputed to us . To a limited extent it is true , and we can best strengthen our defense by defining the extent to which we are defenseless . Wherever we go we find people whom we have every desire to respect insisting upon a pretended interest in our doings , when we know perfectly well that they are bored and indifferent to all that seems worth doing to us . It is this eternal treating of the English lecturer as if he were a child . " Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , displaying a worthless example of his handiwork . " Oh , is n't that lovely , I do like that very much , may I have it ? I want it so much , " says that liar , his father ; and the child is generally satisfied . The English lecturer is nut as young as this , moreover , he does not expect or desire the business man or his wife to have a consuming passion for poetry shall we say ? in general , nor even for his poetry in particular . And when they pump up a show of such passion he does tend to despise them . On the other hand there is nothing more delightful than an hour 's AN APOLOGY FOR THE VISITING LECTURER 567 talk with some turpentine king , or watch king , or super-plumber , when these people tell you all about how they did it and what it means to their own ego that they have done it . When this happens the English lecturer is flattered , for he has been treated for a rare moment as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess I know nothing about your books , though my wife has surely bought them ; I leave culture to her as I 'm too busy to give any time to it myself . Will you try these cigars ? " That is the prologue which offers hope of a pleasant evening . Moreover , there is another point which should be emphasized in this context : even in cases where the English lecturer is more than usually vain and can be swamped with compliments without despising the source from which they flow , he is generally able to keep his judgment about the other English lecturer who preceded him last week . He knows that this fellow has practically no right to any opinion on any subject whatever , and when the memory of him and his table-talk is evoked with rapture , why his contempt is even more apt to dawn than in the other case . And then there is the more serious fact that in wandering round America the lecturer is brought up against a particularly serious fault which is perhaps peculiarly American . Let us give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These incidents all relate to one and the same tour of two or three months and they have to do with race prejudice . First the lecturer found himself in a woman 's college of a Southern state where his subject was The Scientific Attitude to Race Prejudice . After the lecture , " I quite agree , " said the President 's wife to him . " Race prejudice is a dreadful thing , except in the case of negroes , where it is all right , for in the Bible it says , ' God cursed the children of Ham , ' and the children of Ham are the negroes . " Could he help a certain amount of contempt for this ? Could he be blamed when , castingchivalry aside , he cited it later as an example of the Devil quoting Scripture ? Next he went to California where he learned that the country was being ruined by the Japanese . He learned here , incidentally , that all Catholic priests exercised the right of jus prime noctis over Catholic brides and that nuns ' dresses were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida a millionairess told him that the American Civil War was not fought over slavery at all , but because the Catholics and Jews of the North made a conspiracy to capture the Southern railways . In Pennsylvania he was told by a young actress out of a job that the Jews were ruining the stage in America in a deliberate attempt to undermine Christian morality and to sully America 's name abroad . " That explains Hollywood , " she added . In Ohio he heard from his hostess 's lips of a great negro plot to overthrow white America , and in New York State he was told that the Irish in Boston were responsible for all political corruption . In Chicago he found that Lhe homicides were due to the masses of Italians ; though why the homicide statistics of Chicago were higher than those of Naples and Rome the informant did not explain . Of course he also learned with astonishment of all the British bees in the bonnet of the worthy though uncritical Mayor Thompson . And then in another state his host boasted of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . Now are there no grounds for contempt in all this ? In England he would have slammed the door on anyone who spoke in this way ; in America his course of action is more difficult . It is difficult to be the guest in turn of so many different unassimilated groups all hating one another ; and it must be remembered that on this tour the English lecturer had lectured to , or been the guest of highly cultured negroes , Jews , Catholics , Irish , and Italians . It is hard to say what he should do when a generous and charming host or hostess vilifies en masse the groups to which other hosts and hostesses equally generous and charming happen to belong . It may be claimed with confidence that no English lecturer has ever despised Americans with anything like the same fervor as one group of Americans feels in despising another . He does not even despise the Middle West as much as the New York intellectuals do ; his experience and his inclinations put him altogether on the side of Booth Tarkington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt for his audiences : I can only give my own feelings for audiences as some little guide to what most English lecturers probably feel , and 1 would begin by describing a little incident from the real life of a lecturer . It was a sort of variety show attended by about fifteen hundred zealous self-improvers who sat through three lectures of forty-five minutes each and then remained for an hour 's question period . The three subjects were British Labor Politics , British and the Middle East , and What Is Art ? I am not certain of the exact title of the last , but in any case the subject matter was mainly an impassioned appeal to these fifteen hundred citizens to rise up in their moral might and strike a blow for freedom by demanding that James Joyce 's Ulysses should be admitted to American shores . In the question period we all got our share of things to answer , but most of the audience were clearly anxious to concentrate upon finding a definition for the term " indecent hook . " Presently a firm-mouthed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most indecent book I have ever read is Slosson 's Creative Chemistry , " and then sat down . There was some sensation , and doubtless next day a run on the works of Professor Slosson , but the incident led me not merely later to read up a great deal about aniline dyes but to ask the lecturer what he thought of his audiences , and how he reconciled himself to ladies such as this . " I always believe , " he said , " that in every audience there are two or three lonely spirits who may be taught to have courage and think their own thoughts by some chance words of mine . " Now what better attitude can any man have than this ? in England two or three would be a high percentage to hope for in a crowd of a thousand , but I can honestly say that I have always found more than that in any American audience , East or West , small town or New York . After all , when any concourse of people reaches such figures as must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not expect a remarkable level of general intellect and one is at liberty to be thankful , on the whole , for what is actually found in America . Looking for the lonely minds , the timid thinkers with a little originality , the honest brains patiently organizing their fellow club members who do not see so far , is not really as difficult as looking for a needle in a haystack . V If the English lecturer is put in a difficult position , as we have hinted , by being both a guest and a professional employee at once , he is also made to feel his task made hard by his having to combine very often the role of popular educator with that of vaudeville entertainer . Even though he lectures on serious sociological and political problems he does well if he insures himself against loss of complexion , loss of hair- and loss of figure ; and even if he is ugly he will do well to work out in a looking glass those postures and expressions which use his ugliness to the best advantage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bank rate he must be prepared to sign copies of it as if it were a volume of love poems . One lecturer has made an art of this side of his profession : having spent two hours in dressing himself immaculately , he turns to a lady member of the committee and says , " Would you please look me over AN APOLOGY FOR THE VISITING LECTURER 569 and see if I 'm fit to go on the platform ? " He pins a white flower to his bosom and when the lady chairman says , at the end of the lecture , " I 'm sure we are all very grateful to hector Bumkin for his delightful message , " amid the answering applause he tears the flower off and presents it to her . He does several other things which are not for public recitation , and I am only sorry that I can not afford time to say more of him save that he happens to be an American and not an English lecturer . That is probably why he knows this particular job better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avoiding notoriety , while he goes right ahead . After all , the lecturer in modern America whatever his nationality , foreign or homegrown. , fulfils in the social organism much the same function as an eleventh-century troubadour . He is expected to be gallant , charming , inebriating , and if he knows how , why should he disappoint expectations ? We soberer folk who lecture on the duller or at least the less romantic subjects should hardly be despised because our more flashy brethren do their star turns according to plan and , usually , at higher fees . The trouble is that even the more solid talkers can not help in some measure attending to their entertainment value ; they must publish their personalities if they are to have fees or hearers , and it is so difficult to do this gracefully and at the same time not forget the other indispensable thing , The Message . I think perhaps The Message is the English lecturer 's great difficulty . Remember that , as we have already seen , the English lecturer is a child , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some lady to say , " I suppose you are not too old to be kissed ! " " Yes , I am , " I , for one , used to say , blushing violently , though in truth I was really not yet old enough to be kissed . Well , so it is with a message . The English lecturer asked by the lady president , " What is your message ? " instinctively replies , " I have n't got one , " although in fact he may have one all the time ; for he feels himself too young , too inexperienced to claim a right to a message ; he hates the word although he may not hate the thing . And when at the end of a lecture a lady says to him , " Thank you for your message " it is as blighting as it would be in other circumstances for a lady to say , " Thank you for your kiss . " And when , as has actually happened , three ladies running have said respectively , " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; " Thank you very much for your message , " and " Apart from what you said , the way you said it ! Your Oxford accent ! Why , it was better than Grand Opera ! " what can the poor English lecturer be expected to do ? No , no ; let Americans , even New York intellectuals , be fair . We visiting lecturers are faced with some pretty problems of conduct to solve , and when children are set problems which are too difficult they can not be blamed for failing in them ; for the fault lies with the devisers of problems themselves . And so I blame America for most of our failure to be as well-mannered in America as we are at home .
