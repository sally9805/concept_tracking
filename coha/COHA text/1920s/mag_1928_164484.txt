Sir Arthur 's eyes brimmed with tears of relief and triumph because he had just wiped a nasty smudge from his honor by winning a libel suit which has been reported in Canadian papers at Peaches-Browningesque length for many a week ( TIME , March 26 ) . <P> General Currie sued for $50,000 libel damages when a prominent news organ , the Port Hope Guide , charged last June that on the day the World War Armistice was signed ( Nov. 11 , 1918 ) there was " deliberate and useless waste of human life at the capture of Mons by Canadian troops for the glorification of the Canadian Headquarters Staff . " This and supplemental statements were generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the signing of the Armistice he ordered Canadian troops into an action during which several were killed on Armistice Day . <P> The Cobourg jury declared these charges libelous , awarded to Sir Arthur Currie $500 , or 1% of the $50,000 for which he had sued .
