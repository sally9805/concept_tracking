Are scientists irreligious ? <P> A valuable handbook , soon to be published , will be Who 's Who in American Jewry . To the Hebrew scientists whose names will appear therein was despatched a questionnaire to determine their religious affiliations . Seven percent of the scientists had none , 4.6% mentioned none , the rest had definite religious affiliations . <P> Are rural communities devout ? <P> At the Congregationalist conference in Chicago , Dr. Malcolm Dana , Director of Town &; Country department of the Congregational Church Extension Board for the past ten years , made a lugubrious confession . He said : " As a result of four years study of rural conditions , we find that only one-fifth of country people go to church . There are 101,000 town and country churches in America . Two-fifths of them are standing still or losing ground . There are 38,000 rural churches , or 42% of all , which have no pastors . . . . "                    @
