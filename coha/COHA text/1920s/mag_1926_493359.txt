Ownership Love not a loveliness too much , . For it may turn and clutch you so , That you be less than any serf , And at its nodding go . Be master ; otherwise you grow Too small , too humble , like to one Long dispossessed , who stares through tears At his lost house across the sun . Wild carrot in an old field here , Or steeple choked with music there , Possess , as part of what is yours ; Thus prove yourself the heir . Your barony is sky and land , From morning 's start to the night 's close ; Bend to your need Orion 's hounds , Or the small fagot of a rose .
