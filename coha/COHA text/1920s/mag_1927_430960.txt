Do MEN make history or does history make men ? This en gaging query has as ready a solution as the puzzling priority of the hen or the egg . The psychologist is committed to seek in human events no less than in human lives , the play of personality , to find the common motive forces in careers significant and insignificant . For in whatever setting , the nobilities and achievements , the inconsequences and failures , the vices and degradations of men are of one nature , one source . Man 's nature and his works are equally exhibits of his traits ; they are his making and undoing . Much of circumstance is of the same human making , the working of the same psychological forces , but on so monumental a scale that the beating of any ordinary pair of wings against them is helpless . The heroic is exceptional . The human story is the shifting interplay of personality and social circumstance , both ultimately of one origin . Now and then a commanding personality converts a cry in the wilderness into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stress of economics , in the formulations of philosophy , in the expressions of literature , appear the issues of human urges playing their part in the span of a life ; a conflict humble or glorified among universal needs and their satisfaction in a thousand settings . In recorded fact or liberated fancy the dramatic may enlarge the worthy to the heroic and conceive the superman . Yet glory and power may lie in circumstance , with personality lacking in distinction or even handicapped by the clinical frailties of the human lot . The modern note in psychology aims at insight through analysis . Looking upon the drama of personality contending with circumstances or bending them to motive or ambition , it claims a voice in the interpretation of human behavior called history . In one momentous instance the theme may find an emblem in the withered arm of the last of the Kaisers . Herr Emil Ludwig is his psychobiographer . He sets forth that because Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert von Hohenzollern was born in 1859 with a minor deformity , his subsequent behavior was such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call the World War . When Freud comes to replace Grimm in nursery tales , children may read " The Story of the Withered Arm " ; or some psychoanalytic Poe may tell the college  | version as " The Strange Case of an Inferiority Complex . " The problem of William II , like that of many of us , was a problem in personality but was given a definiteness by fate of birth and a stage by fate of circumstance which he roughhewed into history ; the problem of concealing , outwitting , defying a withered arm . Despite it , because of it would say the Freudian Adler ? with a motivation like that of the tongue-tied lad who became Demosthenes , but with dire contrast in issue ? he made of himself a good rider , a skilled if bagging marksman , a martial figure in appearance , an overlord in reality . " The moral victory over his physique was his destruction . " In these oracular words his biographer has carved his epitaph for Wilhelm 's exiled eyes to read . History , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the psychoanalysis of personality . One withered arm upsets the peace and transforms the map of Europe and shapes the map of life of millions of souls animated by the same urges and compulsions , because of the consequential stage that the maneuvering of human motives called politics provides for the star players . The issue hangs not upon the hazard of a diplomatic stroke , but upon the uncertainties of a psychoneural constitution . If the accoucheurs had been more skilful , or if the loyal child had been of other psychic make-up , or if despite his station the young man could have been diverted from Berlin to Hollywood and persuaded to accept the tinsel glory and the matinee idolatry of a " movie " nation , instead of insisting , centuries too late , upon the divinity that once did hedge a king ; what we agree to call history might have been a different story , and all of us might be living and thinking differently . So far as this is true , is all this doom the cost of permitting one neurotic individual to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in the indulgence of fantasy , or experience through the creations of literature , or in what reasonable romance life affords ? The play that many a striving self produces in a private Freudian " little theater " with sporadic uprushes into reality , follows the same plot that holds the stage in the momentous worldtheater so fatefully circumstanced for the last of the Kaisers . The persistent key-note in low life and high life and in the " all highest " is the parent motive of domination . The nurse 's , the parent 's , the schoolmaster 's , the economist 's , the statesman 's problem is all one : to control and adjust the ego-lust , the desire for dominance , the will to prevail . Yet , if crudely restrained or crushed , ambition would fail , and the servitude of dumb driven cattle be the common lot . Masters and slaves in some measure we must be , though in no dread approximation to a Nietzschean world ; for the hazard of it is emblazoned in Freudian characters on the deserted palace walls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insights , two large comprehensions of the public human drama on whatever official stage it may be set . The one is the motivation plot called psychology ; the other  | the " reel " of incident and circumstance called history . Conflicting enterprises , conferences , parliaments , decrees , drawn battles , maneuvers , strategies , armistices , alliances , treaties , victories , subjections , compromises , tell the one tale ; the consequential one . Ambitions , rivalries , lusts , dreads , animosities , triumphs , debasements , tell the other ; the psychological one . The double trend ? manifest content , and latent meaning and determination ? that Freud discovers in the network of the dream , pervade reality . The ostensible plot , the staged conscious conflict makes the record of the conventional historian . By bringing forward the latent subconscious version , the psychologist remodels the technique . We are no longer content , refuse to be blinded by the glamour of diplomacy , the confusion of action , the alleged inevitability of man-made forces . We look behind the scene for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The suppressed secret plot is hidden but not securely buried in the psychoanalytic crypt of Adamitic urges . History supplies the censored version for the populace and the text-books , and to uphold national pride and engage academic profundity . The exposures released by the post-war dismissal of the Freudian censor , contribute to the emancipation of our " now-it-may-be-told " era . The case of Wilhelm Hohenzollern as reported by a social worker would make an interesting assignment . An unfortunate heredity , a birth palsy , a childhood troubled with nervous and allied maladies , disturbed family relations , an unsympathetic mother showing marked preference for her more normal children , a father distrustful and depreciative of his first-born son and heir , absence of sisterly and brotherly affection ; fear of betraying physical weakness unbecoming to a soldierly station and destined career , a natural vanity reinforced by fawning associates ; a lack of true companions , of adequate corrective control , of respected guides , philosophers or friends ; a temperament imperious and bullying by nature as well as by prerogative , with no discipline of enforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissensions ; an impulsive , restless , rebellious , indiscreet , overweening , distrusted , fear-ridden youth , resorting to concealment and pose ; all converging inevitably into a seriously maladjusted personality , ? a tragic combination of a handicapped nature with an aggravating nurture . A devoted marriage ? if that were possible to so ego-bound an individual ? to a perfect mate endowed with skill or charm to subdue unruly nerves , might have brought the redemption of home life ; but as actually arranged was uninspiring and invited further estrangement and avenues of escape for unsatisfied urges . In the Ludwig version : " What went on behind closed doors in this conjugal relation of a gifted nervous man with a sweetnatured , narrow-minded , devout country-girl was revealed to few and by fewer reported ; compassion for the hapless consort of an hysterical autocrat disarmed all criticism . " A noble friendship might have brought salvation or mitigation . Of  | the few intimates in the procession of Wilhelm 's private attachments , paralleling the frequent shifts of his political " pilots , " the most constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole a humanizing influence , bemoaning the trials of his artistic temperament in a diplomatic atmosphere . But when he was involved in more than rumors of a coterie given to the nameless perversion , his long loyalty did not save him from dismissal . His comments when unreserved , were discerning ; the sight of the Kaiser at the maneuvers aroused " that fear of megalomania which I combat incessantly . " The " snapping , " the " hating , " the " lying , " the " betraying " of the Court made him feel as if he were " living in a mad-house ; insane narrowness , insane controversies , insane arrogance ; bedlam , bedlam , bedlam ! " For the rest , the psychoanalytic interest lies in disclosing the personal in the political Kaiser . The strutting pomp and ceremony , the constant change of costume to look the part , the lime-light processioning , the theatricality of the Reise Kaiser , ever on tour , everywhere seeking to impose and receive the plaudits of the crowd ; a conquering hero in any and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , at sea , at court , in his shooting-box , ever insatiable . The golden letters on a block of granite tell the tale : " Here his Majesty , Wilhelm II , brought down his Most Highest 's fifty-thousandth animal , a white cock-pheasant . " Aspiring to be his own chancellor , his own field-marshal , his own admiral ; orator , preacher ; a confident critic dictating to architects , sculptors , painters , dramatists , writers , thinkers ; a self-appointed , selfanointed superman , invoking the divine only to confirm his kingship . We have next to consider Wilhelm as a neurotic . The authoritative diagnosis of Dr. Morton Prince has the added value of a clinical prediction . " The Psychology of the Kaiser : A Study of His Sentiments and Obsessions " was written in 1915 upon the evidence supplied by the Kaiser 's passion for expression , characteristic of his neurosis . " It would be absurd to say as some have said that the Kaiser is afflicted with parancea , but it is true that in normal people we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in this case is a systematised delusion . . . . It would be extravagance to say that the Kaiser 's delusion is anything more than a normal fixed idea which he could change if he wished to , but this fixed idea is so strong , so deeply rooted in his personality , and so directly the expression of a cherished and cultivated wish , conscious or sub-conscious , that it dominates his interpretation of facts which to an ordinary person flatly contradicts it . " Both when his accession was imminent and later , the fitness of the Kaiser to rule was discussed . Herr Ludwig , though he speaks only with the lay authority of a journalist , reaches an acceptable diagnosis . " As a private individual , William the Second would not be declared legally irresponsible in any court of law , by a physician who knew his  | business . It is true that such gifted and complex natures as his are never normal ? they are always on the dividing line ; but while it may please the psychiatrist to write him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be particularly careful to avoid this flight into illness , ' a Freudian formula and will seek to account for him simply and naturally as the inevitable product of heredity and environment , unmodified by controlling and counteracting influences . " It thus appears that the withered arm was but an aggravation in the neurosis , perhaps no more than the last straw on a back constitutionally unsuited to bear responsible burdens steadily and safely . The type of the Kaiser 's emotional instability can hardly be placed anywhere except in the protean clinical picture of hysteria . Because this neurotic liability is more common in women , it must not be hastily inferred that the Kaiser 's neurosis displayed feminine traits ? though these are in evidence ; the paranceid symptoms referred to by Dr. Prince are more common in men . It is this tendency that develops delusional beliefs . They may occasionally find a culture-bed in hysterical soil ; the fusion is expressed in the masculine phases of domination . The Kaiser 's delusions are fixed no deeper than the hysterical level . Had his hysterical instability not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paranceid trend beyond any ordinary hysterical orbit , it might have proved fairly innocent however difficult to those who had to bear with it ; and we should not be tempted to give it a large place in the protocol of history . The delusional beliefs of the Kaiser , integrated closely with the exaggerated and unbalanced traits that express his neurotic nature , have acquired a public , an historical interest . Delusion , Dr. MacFie Campbell tells us , is an attempt of a personality , usually a burdened , distracted , stranded or otherwise illadjusted one , to deal with special difficulties , ? " to neutralize some disturbing factor , to compensate for some handicap . " One can not ascribe to the Kaiser 's belief-complex any deeper place in his maladjustment than we assign to his other vanities and overbearings . Because in part they follow , as Dr. Prince indicates , the prototype of parancea , they do not make the Kaiser a paranceac , or in popular phrase a crank , wholly or in spots . Whether , if his symptoms could be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered as a psychopathic personality is questionable . His place in the gallery of deviation , where portraits of royalty or nobility appear about as in other strains , is much nearer the normal , and is readily paralleled among all sorts and conditions of men . If he had taken his place incognito in the waiting-room of a neurologist 's clinic , the entry on the case-book would hardly have attracted unusual attention . His phases and symptoms of exaltation would have been dwelt upon ; but it is his political exaltation that gave them moment as well as an extraordinary opportunity for gorgeous and imposing , psychologically imperial expression . Moreover , he found  | ready to hand a rationalization of his delusion in the " divine right of kings . " In this device he differs little from other neurotics who utilize similar defense mechanisms . What is unusual is to have at command a body of followers ? the Junkers ? who by tradition were ready to echo and support the pretensions of their war-lord . " What counts psychologically is that the Kaiser believes that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this age , a man who has shown such marked ability in certain directions can be such a fool ? I mean psychologically , of course ? as to persuade himself to believe such stuff , is another story , " the clue to which , Dr. Prince finds in the wish . Whether the Kaiser 's neurotic folly could have been knocked out of him by a course of fagging as administered to youths of high station in the public schools of England , or by any more diplomatic pedagogic device , is a matter of conjecture . His megalomania seems to have gone into retirement with his exile ; but " fifty-nine " is not " nineteen " nor " twenty-nine , " and neuroses run their course . One could trace the shifting expressions of the " kaiser-complex " with the years , and find in them abundant confirmation of the diagnosis . On the circumstantial side there is the shift of excited hostility from family to national rivalry , and then to the menace to his superiority presented by democracy . This became the focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hereditary foe ? or most vehemently toward the enemy within the gates , the SocialDemocratic party , or outside toward any movement favoring the democratic-parliamentary order . Presidents of republics were irritating persons prone to " imagine that they are quite respectable people with whom Royalty can consort and sympathize . " " Republicans are by nature revolutionary , logically to be regarded as people who will one day have to be shot or hanged . " " Take my word for it , Nicky a letter to the Czar , 189s , the curse of God lies ever on that Nation France . A sacred duty is imposed by heaven on us Christian Kings and Emperors , ? to uphold the doctrine of the divine right of Kings . " The Social-Democratic party was a red rag and a bete noir in one ; his irresponsible utterances under this irritation are notorious . In his comment upon the Hague conference any diplomatic reserve is overcome by the neurotic urge to expression . " In practice , I , at any rate , will henceforth rely and call upon God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolutions . " Wilhelm the neurotic dominates above William II the Emperor of Germany . The political role , even when it occupies the stage , takes its clue and color from the neurotic one . The neurologist sees the resulting picture as a kaiser 's neurosis ; the historian , as a neurotic on a throne . When dealing with a case in which every act and attitude of personal life is determined by station , it requires an extraordinary detachment to treat a weighty " scrap of paper " as if it were a private note disclosing a personal failing . Writing from Berlin to St. Petersburg , as one anointed to another :  | " I do n't in the least look forward to enjoying the Prince of Wales ' visit ? forgive me , he is your brotherin-law after all ? but with his intriguing disposition he will certainly try to play some political game with the ladies . May Allah consign him to perdition , as the Turk says . . . It is to be hoped that the Mandi will drive all these English into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have passed from one greengrocer to another about a rival who chanced to be connected by marriage , and if presented in a court of domestic relations as an exhibit of common human failings would have been dismissed in a ten-line notice in the daily news . The diagnosis in such neuroses always looks for symptoms in the depressive phase as well as in exaltation ; looks for inhibitions , repressions , fears , timidities , shrinkings , and reactions of dejection that are at times suggestive of exhaustion , alternating with the more typical exaltation . The psychologist detects them here in the vindictive hatreds , the insensibilities , the envies , of the aggressive excitable neurotic . Herr Ludwig records that the Kaiser was subject to " intermittent nervous irritation invariably followed by characteristic depression . " To this may be added his abnormal fear of exposure to contagion , the careful police patrol of his person , his private thrift in contrast to public extravagance , his cowardly desertion of friends in trouble , his shirking of real work and absence of deep interest , and , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exile . Many passages from his stream of addresses are more convincing as neurotic extravagances than as political appeals ; and the urge to utterance , " the bad fairy 's gift to Wilhelm , " is itself a typical symptom . Much of it is bluster to conceal a shrinking defensive . There is as much vehement denunciation as lordly admonition . An outlet in words is often a compensation for a shrinking in deeds . It was all part of a restless vivacity that in an amiable mood had its redeeming side . But when playful it was gruffly so with an uncertain touch leading to poltroonery , mingling jest with insult , ? a rather cheap raillery , often to the consternation of Court circles . It completes the picture of nervous , febrile , tense , uncertain energy , spending itself impulsively , and in the delicacies of diplomatic life converting what may have been meant as a harmless fire-cracker into dynamite ; even on state papers occur such comments as " sheer imbecility . " Clearly a more fateful psychic makeup for a leading role on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Machiavelli himself . To all this the circumstantialist historian replies that the position of the Emperor of all the Germans remains the determining factor in the life of Wilhelm , and that the vagaries in the conduct of the imperial responsibility are but incidental . The march of events , the historian says , took their course , and his part in them is the significant record to be written by those expert in such affairs ; the rest belongs to private memoirs where it may well remain undisturbed . The psychologist can not concede this view without abandoning his case , though admitting  | that the mailed fist and " Deutschland iiber alles " policy might have caused an eruption in volcanic Europe under any auspices . For a normal , reasonably extroverted , profitably occupied man , the enterprise of career ? the life work , the job ? in large part shapes and absorbs the man ; the personality extends in it and through it . For the introverted neurotic , this transformation is partial , imperfect , arrested , and in the extreme impossible . The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a Lincoln , in whom a supernormally poised control and humane devotion to a noble goal , gave to a career just that inspiring infusion of personality that makes the man shine through the emancipator . There , psychoanalysis would be an impertinence . For a marked neurotic the career is the personality in a public relation . For most of us , personality and career are fused with shifting values of the one or the other influence . In the case of the Kaiser , Germany was the career . There is little to show that the Kaiser attained to a responsible , objective pursuit of policy or a leadership in sentiment and opinion . The Teutonomania that prepared for the war and rose to irresponsible expression in it , was cherished and embraced by the political Kaiser as an aggrandizement of the personal one . He encouraged but did not originate the doctrines or the propagandist campaign ; he seems to have taken an active part in the promotion of the cult and took under his patronage its spokesman , the English renegade Houston Chamberlain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend the greatness and the terror of Germania to the farthest East , was a bombastic bluster that proved to be the deadliest boomerang of all times ; Wilhelm 's neurosis gave to history the sinister ' modern reference of the Hun . Councils , official and secret , record complications rather than aid and direction , which the will of the Emperor introduced . Wilhelm 's career as a ruler has its modest place in the current of events in which he was inevitably an important participator ; his personality prevented him from making it a significant career in any other relation than that of estrangements , which he aggravated so definitely that perhaps he will be said to have created them . The isolation and encirclement of Germany that were resented as a political conspiracy , could hardly have assumed their proportions without the unfortunate neurotic stimulation of the Kaiser under the aggravation of the withered arm . The withered arm is more a symbol than a text ; and what parable it holds may be turned to the aving grace of normality to carry heavy burdens , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A wellbalanced nature would accept any such not too incapacitating stigma naturally ; as naturally as Lincoln made , a jest of his niggardly dower of personal attraction , or as Rostand engages a kindly sympathy for a romantic Cyrano unkindly deprived of his part by nature 's too generous dower in the matter of a nose . And those who listened to President Eliot 's words paid as casual attention as he did to the  | accident that one side of his face was discolored . The normal-minded escape complexes by encouraging their strengths and by disciplining their weaknesses ; we all build character by the aid and the control of temperament . " With most men , sick or well , " observes Mrs. Shaler , who in her " Masters of Fate " assembles the heroic notables who have achieved in spite of incapacities , " the battle of life is fought uphill . . . . " " The cripple has a chance of heroism always at hand , Fate has set a combat in his soul and it may be his own fault if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an artifact , ? the issue of a selected interest , often as conventional as the traditions of the stage or the customs of society . Men are men ; and most consequentially motives not manners make the man . The reconstruction of a circumstantial record into a psychological one must be included within the historical horizon . Dr. Campbell holds that the millions of men who were wiped out in the World War were destroyed neither by machine-guns nor poisongas , nor by famine or pestilence , but by the inadequacy of the beliefmechanisms which civilization has been able to establish , for translating motive into action . The greater war and the greater salvation must be there fought and won . If we accept as the ultimate goal of all knowledge , its convergence upon human control , we face not an alternative but a dual adjustment : so to shape the machinery for control as to place in command those of fittest endowment for direction ; so to train and encourage those qualities of nature that are of choicest value for the enterprise . The one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for human quality ; the other a control of human nature to fit it to worthy roles , competently performed . Expressed educationally , it is what we educate for , and what we educate and educate with ; changing human circumstance and changing human nature to their better adjustment under an increasing sense of purpose . Expressed politically in an acceptable American formula , it is the problem of making the world safe for democracy , by making democracy safe for a redeemed human nature . In the career reviewed , which ' resulted in the decree that this shall be the last of the kaisers , there was a lamentable failure , a conjunction of misfortune , in both phases . It seems to emphasize the hazard of setting a stage in which such a tragedy is possible , and the penalty exacted of an inadequate assignment of parts when the stage is all the world . Life is the consolidation of personality and circumstance , or in Emersonian phrase : " Know . in thyself and the world one selfsame soul . "  |     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
