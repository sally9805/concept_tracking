Experience has taught the U. S. Post Office Dept. that the public uses about 3,200,000,000 stamped envelopes each year . Accordingly , finding its supply low , it advertised last month for bids to supply envelopes over a period of four years , in the amount of 12,800,000,000 . <P> Unusual attention met the appeal of the Post Office Dept . For the first time in 58 years , more than two companies submitted bids . And when the three offers were examined , last week , Postmaster General New found that low bid was 22% less than the present contract ( with Middle West Supply Co. , Dayton , Ohio ) , would add some $5,000,000 to the shearings and scrapings so insistently demanded by Budgeteer Herbert Mayhew Lord . Postmaster General New named a committee to study the bids , probably to recommend awarding the contract to the low International Envelope Corp. , subsidiary of the ( world 's largest ) International Paper Co.
