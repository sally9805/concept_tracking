PROBABLY none in all the city is merrier at Yuletide than we ourself . But it is a merriment arrived at after facing fearful odds . The odds are : four postmen , four ashmen , two elevator boys , a night watchman , two delicatessen delivery boys , sixteen hotel doormen , four club waiters , two wine merchants , a cook , two janitors  --  toward all of whom we feel kindly until they get that holly-berry look in their eyes . The look begins to come there about the first of December , and although we are not one to discount the jollity of giving gifts at Christmas , the process has taken on businesslike proportions undreamed of in the days when reindeer were reindeer and when a postman was a postman , not four postmen . WHILE making a very important train journey recently , we discovered  --  quite by accident  --  what actually happens to the old razor blades which are deposited in the slots provided for the purpose in Pullman smoking-rooms . The blades drop down a cleverly concealed chute , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the train , they are later removed stealthily at night by the brakeman , who sells them under an assumed name , the proceeds going towards the purchase of new rolling stock and more confusing terminals . The way we discovered this ( and the railroads are doing everything they can to keep it quiet ) was by talking to a brakeman . IT was a friend returned from Italy who put the idea into our head . He said that in the high and beautiful tower of the cathedral of Milan is a little bar , discreet and well managed . There , roof-wanderers and tower-climbers refresh themselves with wines . For the life of us we ca n't see why the good people of Morning-side Heights can not profit by this example in their effort to raise enough money to complete the new St. John 's . A little Italian wine , at market prices . would rear a cathedral whose proportions could easily surpass the trustees ' wildest dreams . IT is reasonably clear ( at any rate we think it is ) that there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fantastic nature , such as we already have suggested . Valvular exits would solve it . Depopulation would solve it . But chipping off a section of sidewalk here , hacking away apiece of park there  --  these are the putterings of an administration whose intentions are good and whose vision is merely normal , in a city whose boundaries are fixed and whose occupants are excitable . The very operation of widening one street obstructs and clutters up another . It is conceivable that private cars will some day be prohibited on Manhattan , and the number of cabs , busses , and trucks held to a definite limit . Even that would n't sclve it . Maybe traffic is like religion : everybody has to solve it for himself .

GEORGE CREEL is telling the story of a lady who , usually devoted to fiction , recently became engrossed in the opening chapters of Ludwig 's " Napoleon . " A little to her surprise she found the biography , she told a friend one day , perfectly thrilling . The friend , it turned out , had just finished reading the book and after making several comments on the writing of it asked , " Have you come to the retreat from Moscow yet ? " The other interrupted her hastily . " No , " she exclaimed , " but do n't tell me  --  do n't tell me ! " About Colonel Lindbergh Pr HE tumult and the shouting hay -- I ing died , temporarily at least , Lindbergh , before Washington put its spotlight on him , was able to get about town without too much ado and was a big success socially . From the fact that he was reported here and there in the more active social circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for receptions , teas and dinners . At least three of his hosts likewise entertained Tenney about a year ago . This , as Arthur Brisbane would observe , is interesting . We heard not a single word of criticism about the young aviator . He seemed to say and do the right thing . We saw him once at a tea where he was surrounded by several young ladies with whom he was talking over his flight across the Atlantic . They found him still willing , even eager , to discuss his experiences and emotions on this adventure . We also were in Abercrombie &; Fitch 's one day when he came in and , while this resulted in some embarrassment to us , it happened to give us an opportunity to see the mass public in action . His arrival in the men 's department of the store caused no particular flurry . Indeed , he was for once rather ignored . He was actually forced to wait a minute or two until a salesman finished with another customer . As a result he seemed happy . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he whistled one or two notes of " All Alone " and wiggled his toes contentedly . He was not even blushing . With our stepped happily into the elevator and asked to be let off at the women 's department , to which we were bent on a Christmas errand . There our dreams of the sanity of the human race were shattered . Packed before the elevators , lips parted and handkerchiefs ready to wave , a dozen or two ladies were banked , craning , stretching , peering for a glimpse of the young colonel as he passed the floor . Into this throng were we delivered , and as the elevator closed behind us we were met with such a barrage of frowns , sneers , scornful glances , groans of " Oh , it 's not him ! " and " Who said that was Lindy ? " that , with burning ears , we sneaked to the rear of the store and made our way out through a door labelled " Emergency Exit . " ?

Republic Theatre , 2nd Year . " Where Is Harlem ? has never been a district to us so much as an emotional state , hence we were surprised to learn the dusty answer that researchers recently got when they sought to determine the official southern boundary . Ancient books and maps showed that it begins at Seventy-fourth Street and Avenue A and from there runs diagonally to One Hundred and Twenty - ninth Street and the Hudson River . The measurements were discovered when the Reformed Church of Harlem decided to move from Lenox Avenue and One Hundred and Twenty-third Street to Park Avenue and Eighty-sixth Stree t . What was everyone 's polite confusion to learn that an old bequest of a million and a quarter dollars for the upkeep of the church bore the proviso that it be expended solely for religious enIightment in the town of Harlem . The records disclosed , besides accommodating boundaries , the story of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place as a separate city . It was claimed New York City had taken it without legal right or a by-your-leave . Nothing was done about that . A Violinist Abroad WE have heard of some scheduled things that ? ? THE NEW YORKER 19 during Heifetz ' recent long tour of far countries , and print them here in connection with hit coming to town this week . What should happen ( not to be chronological ) but that he should be apprised on his way into Honolulu harbor that it was against the law to import the two bottles of 1811 brandy he had got in New Zealand . Working swiftly , an admiring and influential passenger procured permission for the violinist to " use intoxicating liquors for medicinal purposes . " Everything was fine until the customs officials became technical and asked him whether he had a permit from Washington to land medicinal intoxicants . He said " no " and they said " ah , " but , because they seemed not too unhappy at the prospect of retaining the contraband , he requested permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heifetz poured the brandy down a washbowl . In Australia Heifetz was forced to adhere to the custom of opening every program with " God Save the King " and , having played it a couple of dozen times he was about to render it at his first concert in Honolulu when he luckily glanced over his shoulder and saw that his accompanist was preparing to play the Vitalli Chaconne . So Heifetz played that . Melba was in Sydney when he was there and she presented him with a laurel wreath at his opening concert and later , hearing his violin in the apartment next to hers , sent him in a bowl of red apples . In Melbourne he alarmed his entourage by twisting a finger painfully in getting out of a car . It bothered him for two weeks and once , we are told , he made as if to quit in the middle of a Paganini selection , but stuck it out . In his hotel lobby in Perth he found one day a large group of people , each with a genuine Guarnerius or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to tell the proud owner of each violin that it was not genuine . During his tour , which ranged from San Francisco to Rangoon , his chief diversion was the movies , and in Sydney he bought a movie camera . He did n't take any pictures , however , except a few snaps of Fiji Islanders , for which he had to pay the natives . They also sold him a dozen bananas for fifty cents , right off the tree . He did n't play for them or for the white folks an the island . With his companions the violinist drank water out of canvas bags swinging from the platforms of trains in the interior of Australia and took a bath in Rangoon by means of a sawed-ofF barrel and a dipper . An associate reports that this city will find his playing has become " freer and warmer .

Upon his entrance he noted a knowing expression on the face of the flunkey who guarded the gate and was surprised to find himself ushered unannounced past half a dozen offices to and through the sound-proof doorway of the prince of commerce . An argument at once ensued between the latter and his menial , the executive bellowing that he had given orders not to be disturbed , his man replying with smiles and winks and pointing towards the package under the caller 's arm . The mystery was quickly solved , of course . " With a package like that , " growled the executive , " the boys out front would think my parson was a new bootlegger ! " The Art of Uplift AGRIM-MOUTHED lady of about fifty entered a Fifth Avenue bus this week and chanced to sit down opposite a young and by no means unpretty girl of perhaps twenty . The latter she regarded sternly for some moments and then said in a tone that the entire bus could hear , " Pull your skirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even allowing the command to break the rhythm of her gum-chewing . The alder , now militant , again ordered in an even louder tone , " Pull your skirts downl " and , this again producing no results , thwacked the object of her uplift several times over the knees with a newspaper . At this point the conductor en- ? ? tered . It was obvious that he thought he ought to do something about the matter , but it was also obvious that he did n't know what . The militant lady , however , took the initiative . " Sir , " she demanded , " do you countenance this on your busses ? " The conductor gathered himself , inspected the girl ( whose skirt was not unusually short ) and said " Yes , ma'am . " The elderly reformer thereupon arose and , carefully unfolding her Times , pointed to an account of the Lilliendahl trial verdict , leaned over to the girl and said scornfully , " It 's people like you that bring about these things . " She then got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I : learn of a cycle of communications between Mr. Coolidge and a classmate at college . The latter was among the first to send a note of congratulation when our President became Governor of Massachusetts . Mr. Coolidge acknowledged the good wishes in a letter beginning " Dear Jim " ( we ? will call it Jim ) . The exchange took place again promptly when the statesman became Vice-President . This time the salutation of the acknowledgment was " Dear Johnson . " A third note was sent when Mr. Coolidge was elected President . It must have been one of thousands , but the Chief Executive answered it right away . It opened , however , " Dear Classmate . " We Meet Mr. Claus AS everybody knows , there is more than one Santa Claus . The one we cornered is known to census takers , who do n't go in much for symbolism , as Eugene S. Todd . Just now he is the Santa Claus at Macy 's . In other seasons he is a model and salesman . From him we learned that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , and commercial jealousies . Mr. Todd , for example , is ? a " throne Santa , " which is the kind that sits in a store and talks to children and is the best kind to be . Throne Santas have little truck with street-corner Santas . A throne Santa Claus dismisses the latter as being probably opportunist sandwich men , disabled laborers , and such . Throne Santa Clauses , however , are men of an established guild , like actors and circus clowns . Mr. Todd has met all the throne Santa Clauses in town and he says the Abraham &; Straus Santa Claus would he the most perfect one of all because he has the best face for it , except that he has no heard of his own and must wear an artificial one of cotton . Mr. Todd 's isolated splendor as Saint Nicholas is a real beard that comes down to his fourth vest button , and natural hair that falls over his shoulders . He mentioned as outstanding Kris Kringles the one at Bamberger 's DECEMBER 17 , 1927 in Newark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a professional actor , and Albert Graham , who has worked in various stores for years . Santa Todd became one of the Claus family by accident . He was selling magnetite , which is lodestone and lucky and can divine the sex of unborn babies , and was making about fifteen dollars a day at it , when his sister fell ill . Taking care of her and the household , he did n't have time to shave or get his hair cut , and one day he encountered an artist on the street who asked him to pose as Moses . He has posed since then for many artists ; he has been every notable with a heard , from Neptune to Michael Angelo , Joaquin Miller , and Walt Whitman . It was an artist who told Wanamaker 's about him some years ago , and for several years he played Saint Nick at that store . Mr. Todd is proud not only of his hair and beard but of his handling , which is the technical term for a Santa 's manner of talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a twinkle , speaks in a gentle voice , and has won the hearts of thousands of children , all in fact save one grimly realistic lad who , told that Santa would bring him anything he asked for , replied skeptically , " Says you . " Girls are more gullible , he reports . They prefer dolls even to jewelry . Boys , these days , lean toward mechanical toys rather then live ponies , and there was one who requested a fully equipped surgical operating room . Mr. Todd is spelled every two hours by an assistant Santa , whom we heard the other day saying gently to a demure lass , " Come to Santa , little goil . " This Santa Claus is a former circus clown . Mr. Todd does not approve of this pronunciation ; although born in Manhattan , he says " girl . " He has a little grandchild who does not believe in Santa any more . She has inevitably heard too much shop talk . We watched him speak to a tremulous parade of a hundred youngsters the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to her mother , " He 's been caught . " By this we knew at once that she meant he ought to be up on the roof in the open air . Keeper of the Light AYOUNG lady and gentleman were walking along Sixth Avenue after the theatre one night lately when they saw a passer-by slip and fall THE NEW YORKER 21 into one of our chronic street excavations . The young man hastened to lend assistance but unfortunately suffered a similar fate , tumbling also into the hole . Although thoroughly frightened , the young lady acted quickly . Seeing a traffic policeman a block away , she ran to him and begged for assistance . The officer hesitated . His instructions were never to leave his traffic-light switch . Finally he decided to temporize with authority . " All right , " he said , " you mind the traffic and I 'll go see what I can do . When that light , " he added , pointing , " changes , you move the switch over here , and when it changes back you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes the young lady , in evening dress and filmy gown , managed , like the lighthouse keeper 's daughter , the light that must never be dimmed . curately for ninety years that two watchmakers have asked the right to probe for the secret of its precision . Until long after 1865 the bank 's water was drawn from a well sunk in the cellar . During the Civil War , when several persons were killed in draft riots in streets not so far away , the directors of the bank became panicky lest some ruffian might enter the building and open the iron box without bothering to look for the key . The gold was concealed in old-fashioned ledgers whose leaves had been cut out , and lowered into the well , against more settled times . The bank has among its depositors some of the oldest residents of the city , one of them John R. Voorhis , ninetyeight-year-old President of the Board of Elections . His agreement in 1862 to accept paper money in lieu of goldis still preserved among the institution 's documents .

The landlady was prepared for the news that a wall had collapsed when the tenant burst out with her grievance . " I wanted you to know , " she said , " that I was kept awake last night by a cricket .
