The Roman Catholic Church in England is proceeding industriously in the work of elevating 252 British martyrs to the rank of Saint . <P> In 1874 Cardinal Manning and the Roman Bishops of England petitioned the Pope to " introduce the cause " of 315 persons who had been executed for heresy in the reigns of Henry VIII , Elizabeth , James I ( 1509-1625 ) . The Pope granted the honor of beatification ( Sainthood ) to 54 of them and as signed their general feast to May 4 . <P> The remaining 261 were given the lower rank of " Venerable Servants of God . " Later , 9 more were proved to be Saints and were beatified accordingly . <P> Last year the Pope granted a Court of Inquiry into the cause of the remaining 252 . <P> The Court sits at Westminster Cathedral . It convenes twice each week to examine and pass on the evidence . <P> The 252 causes will require about two years ' work . Final decision rests with the Pope after the ecclesiastical law yers have completed their arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long dead , whose degree of holiness is the subject of such intense investigation , are representative of every county in Great Britain . <P> Some were persons of high degree , some of low ; for example , the candidates for Sainthood from London are : <P> Name and place of execution : <P> William Carter , printer ; Tyburn , 1584 <P> John Lowe , priest ; Tyburn , 1586 <P> Thomas Felton , priest ; Brentford , 1588 <P> Richard Leigh , priest ; Tyburn , 1588 <P> Polydore Plasden , priest ; Tyburn , 1591 <P> Edward Waterson , priest ; Newcastle , 1593 <P> Earl of Arundel ; Tower of London , 1595 <P> Thomas Garnet , S.J. ; Tyburn , 1604 <P> Hugh Green , priest ; Dorchester , 1642 <P> John Gavan , S.J. ; Tyburn , 1679 <P> Viscount Stafford , Tower Hill , 1680 <P> Executions of heretics can not properly be understood unless it is remembered that high treason , in those days , was heresy . That high treason was heresy was a ruling of the Roman Catholic Church which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Rome . This same doctrine is still technically the law of the Roman Church , and received explosion as late as 1864 , when Pope Pius IX ( Pio Nono ) issued his tremendous Syllabus of Errors* <P> " It is an error to assert that every man is free to embrace the religion he shall believe true , guided by the light of reason . " <P> " It is an error to assert that the Church ought to be separated from the State and the State from the Church . " <P> " It is an error to assert that in the present day it is no longer expedient that the Catholic religion shall be held as the only religion of the State , to the exclusion of all other modes of worship . " <P> " It is an error to assert that it is allowable to refuse obedience to legitimate princes . " <P> <P> *This was the Syllabus in which the Pope said : " Si quis dixit : Romanus Pontifex potest ac debet cum progressu , cum liberalismo et cum recenti civilitate sese reconciliare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman Pontiff can or ought to come to terms with progress , liberalism or modern civilization-let him be accursed .
