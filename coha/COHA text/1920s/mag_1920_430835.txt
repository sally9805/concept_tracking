 | A MOST significant change that is beginning to take place today with the quiet , slow surety of growth from deep roots is in the courts of America , where instinctive mother-sense , slipping in underneath the law and its application , is slowly but surely moving toward a lifting of the whole cumbrous fabric out of the control of ceremony , technicality , censure , and punishment , into that of the diagnostician with reclamation and reconstruction as the end in view . Mother instinct , that divine gift bestowed on woman for the safety of human kind , in coming out of the closeted nursery into the big , troubled nursery of the world , has nowhere found a broader , more basic application to human ills than here . We are accustomed to think of the law as an intricate , technical matter , the court 46 as an awesome place of ponderous officialdom ? the cold-eyed jurist on his high bench , the nervous witness in the box , the bailiff , the policemen walking about with their big sticks , the law-picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composite rests the title to the law , with the culprit clearly on the outside . Reduce all this to human terms of human beings trying to arrive at a solution of a human problem , under a law intended to be equitable and in the reach of every one , rich and poor alike , never technical ? for the original purpose back of all law was the safeguarding of humanity , the prevention of the high sense of the community from outrage at the hands of the few-and the dreaded court becomes a haven of friendly help . And this humanizing of the court ? a thing that affects the state quite as vitally as it does the culprit ? is the big change that the coming of women into judgeships is starting . This conclusion is based on a visit to the court of nearly every woman acting as judge in America , and a following out of the ramifications of her constructive work , which has grown out of her favored insight into conditions . Women know the terrific cost of bringing a human life into being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too costly , and no application of a curative plan too involved , if it will tend toward that life 's proper adjustment to the world in which it is asked to serve . Human reclamation is not philanthropy ? rather , it is economy ? and the price , however high , is low compared to the cost to the state if that life is not reclaimed . The mother nature sees reclamation as the thing , as against destruction for the sake of exam-  | ple , and this is the theory on which women judges proceed . Judge Jean Norris , the most recent accession ' appointed by the mayor of New York in October last to the Court of Inferior Criminal Jurisdiction ? the only woman judge of a crimi-ial court in America ? rotates between the Domestic Relations and the Woman 's Court . Judge Norris is a New York woman , a graduate of New York and Fordham universities . She practised law in New York City for ten years and is president of the National Association of Women Lawyers . She has always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been counsel for the International Child Welfare League ? and it is easy to see , after a day in her court , that the mayor has made no mistake . Her appointment was strongly advocated by numerous influential bodies of men and women . She sits daily ? including Sundays ? and handles the problems of the lowest dregs of the unfortunate humanity of a great city the prostitutes , shoplifters , debauchces , drug addicts , etc. ; and in the Court of Domestic Relations , all the varieties of human tangles that grow out of domestic friction . She sends diseased women and drug addicts to hospitals for treatment , and young girls ? when possible ? back to their relatives on probation . Already , in her short experience as judge , she has returned to their home towns many of those rounded up ? to the Pacific Coast , to Cuba , and to Canada , the court paying their expenses . Judge Norris sees in her office a wonderful opportunity to help human kind and is working out many plans- for improvement of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women prisoners . Seattle has two women jurists , Judge Othilia G. C. Beals and Judge Reah M. Whitehead , both regularly elected Justices of the Peace who handle all kinds of civil cases without discrimination as to sex . Judge Beals , a beautiful woman of what is generally termed the society type , is a magnetic public speaker as well as a judge of fine discernment . She comes from an old family of well-known lawyers and jurists and received the first Bachelor of Laws degree conferred on a woman by the University of Washington . She practised law , specializing in Admiralty , for a short time , was then appointed judge to succeed her brother , Major John E. Carroll , who was called to France , and was regularly elected the following year . Shortly after taking office she advocated a change in the existing procedure in the litigation of small . amounts , going before the legislature with a bill to establish a department for the trial of small claims in the Justice Courts . She wrote the bill , presented it ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By its terms a small claims department is created in every Justice Court in the state , wherein civil matters involving not more than $20 can be tried at a maximum cost of $1.50 . Lawyers and witness fees are eliminated , and the procedure is simple and direct . The law went into effect last June , and Judge Beals has had the pleasure of  | trying a great many of these claims . The department meets a real want , enabling the than or woman of small means to litigate claims that otherwise would not be adjudicated , as the regular cost would prove prohibitive . Judge Reah M. Whitehead brings another I angle to bear on her administration of justice . She was a stenographer , studied law at night school , passed the bar examination , was employed in the prosecuting attorney 's office , was appointed deputy prosecuting attorney ? the first woman to hold this office ? filed for the judgeship in 1914-ten others filing for the one vacancy ? was elected , and in 1918 was reelected by the largest vote cast on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support . Like Judge Beals , Judge Whitehead 's experience in the civil courts has opened her eyes to much needed legislation . She drafted the new Reformatory bill which will provide Washington with a Zoo-acre farm where unfortunate women may be rehabilitated ; also the Affiliation bill , which will provide care and support for the children of unwedded mothers . Just now she is pushing a movement suggested to her by the practise in the army of giving men accused of a crime a psychopathic test to determine whether or not they are fully responsible and non-defective persons . If this is a just measure in the army , argues this business-like young judge , it is just in civil life ; and what she has advocated so far , her constituency has seen fit to back up , so the psychopathic test will undoubtedly become one of the new factors in criminal judging in the far western city . The Suitcase Movement Mary M. Bartelme , of the Juvenile Court of Chicago , a strong , understanding sort of person with kind brown eyes that light up like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really dean of women judges of America , though she has the title only through courtesy , hers being one of the states whose constitution does not provide for actually elected or appointed women judges . For seventeen years she has been the official guardian of Illinois girls who need guardianship , and for seven years assistant to the judge of the Juvenile Court , hearing all cases of girls up to sixteen , and recommending all rulings . She has a small , private court room where delinquents are brought and where their troubles are heard with only women present . Judge Bartelme has two practical plans , and she carries them out . She believes , first , that self-respect is inculcated by appropriate dress , and second , that normal life makes normal conduct , and normal life is home life . To meet the first need , she has instituted the suitcase movement . Philanthropic-minded women of Chicago provide her with suitcases for her girls , each beautifully fitted out with a complete change of clothing and all necessary dress and toilet accessories , and the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive serge dress made from her own measurements . " You can talk and advise , " said judge Bartelme , " but you 've got to back up your advice . You ca n't say to a young girl , I want you to make good , ' and look her in the face and know she has n't a rag to back up her selfrespect . If you could only see the joy that lights up a girl 's face when she is handed one of these suitcases and realizes that it is-to be all her own , you would want to tell all the women of America about it , so that in every town they would meet together and make this simple provision for their unfortunate girls . Further , being decently clothed helps the girl to find a new job and hold it . " The second need , of turning girls back to homes , judge Bartelme has been able to meet in a measure through what are known as the @#  | Mary Clubs . Chicago has two of these , well managed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way stations for girls who have been indiscreet , perhaps , but are not reform school cases . Fully ninety-eight percent of those given the advantage of the Mary Clubs have been restored to useful womanhood . Gratia L. Rice , a lifelong educator , an art lecturer , and one of the most pleasing personalities in public life today , is another woman doing all the work of a judge . is termed " judge " by courtesy , and has won the gown spiritually anyway , though the law of her state does not permit actually elected woman judges . Three years ago fifty prominent women educators got together in New York City and pledged themselves to go wherever upbuilding work was to be done in America and do it . Gratia L. Rice 's pledge landed her in the Juvenile Court of Bridgeport , Connecticut , a town with a voting population of 20.000 and an actual population of 226,000 ; largely foreigners who work in the factories . have little respect for American law and order , and an abiding faith that this government of ours will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pieces as much of it as is within their reach , while waiting for the big crash for superior looting opportunities . They draw wages unheard of in any European experience , and naturally have little conception of what to do with their money . They own no property , take no interest in the country , send their children to their own schools where they are taught in their own tongue , and put religious mandates above those of the state . Americanizing the Foreigner The conservative population of the New England coast-line mostly shuts its eyes to the situation which is honeycombing them with danger . Connecticut has had very little constructive legislation since the putting into effect of her old , original " Blue Laws , " and thus , without laws to back her efforts and without wide-awake cooperation from the American element , Gratia L. Rice has had to depend almost altogether on personal suasion . She has hunted out a good mother in each block of foreigners and made her ? " block lieutenant " to assist in breaking up lawlessness . She organizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is working them over , boy by boy , into a better understanding of American freedom . Her work is really Americanization of the most practical order , and perhaps this is what all Juvenile Court work will resolve itself into , for many of our young people need to be aroused to a keener appreciation of their opportunities and responsibilities if we are really to stop the old boat from rocking . And then there comes Judge Orfa Jean Shontz , of the Juvenile Court of Los Angeles . I felt , after spending several days going into her work and its spreading rays , that here at last , on the far western rim of our continent , where the population is principally American , is the perfect blooming ? the woman doing for the child , unhampered by financial or legal limitations , just exactly what every motherhearted woman would want to see done for her own child , were it in trouble and she powerless in the matter . Proper readjustment , like everything else , comes high . It requires trained specialists and scientific appliances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done and common , primitive mothering . And only Los Angeles , it seems , has been ready to undertake the job and pay the bill . It must foe remembered , therefore , in putting Judge Shontz 's work at the very top of that being done for rehabilitation of humanity through the courts all over America today , that she has this splendid cooperation of her city and county to the extent that whatever course , in her judgment . is needed to make a real citizen out of the young offender-she has jurisdiction over girls  | up to twenty-one and boys to thirteen ? is hers to follow . No strings are drawn tight over the money purse just at the critical moment ; and every woman knows that however clearly you may see a solution to a problem , you ca n't apply it if you have n't the money . You ca n't send a girl away to school unless you can pay her bills , and you ca n't bring up a subnormal child 's weight without sufficient milk and eggs and other good wholesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are as chaff before the wind . I found Judge Shontz in her attractive office in the Hall of Records , a fair , earnest little person with the level gaze of one who looks through and through you , but is kindly rather than critical . She is n't a particle aweinspiring , and yet you know in a flash that you 'd never try to put anything over on this judge ; it would n't be a bit of use . I told her at once my mission , that I wanted to visit her court and watch her try cases . " Then you are just in time , " she said , pinning on her hat , " for I was just starting *gut . " Out ? Where , I wondered , for her offices opened off the customary court room with its customary furnishings . " We do n't bring young people here , " she explained . " They scarcely realize they are in a court room ? and we do n't call them trials , just hearings . We- hear their troubles at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protects the Children She took me along in her car and on the way told me something of herself ; a graduate of Ames College , Iowa , and of the University of California , she was first a business woman , then a probation officer , where she saw the need of law for women , was induced to take up its study , practised a year and a half , became secretary to the Probate Court , and in 1915 was appointed to her present office which she has held ever since . " Ours , " she explained , " is a socialized court . It stands in the place of a guardian . When the home fails , the court steps in , and no legal technicality is ever allowed to stand in the way of our doing what seems best for the child . Our aim is to find the trouble back of the trouble and apply a cure ? never to convict and punish . The children of Los Angeles ? and this includes girls up to twenty-one ? are wholly in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ever supposed to arrest or touch in any way one of our girls . The court is the refuge of the troubled young person , and whatever the difficulty ? faulty parents , faulty teeth or tonsils , faulty food , faulty conception of mine and thine and right and wrong ? all these things under which the young suffer so unfairly are looked into with the aid of a competent staff of skilled specialists , and the trouble is accurately diagnosed before any curative remedies are applied , just exactly as if , in a case of skin eruption , the physician would first determine whether the trouble were chicken pox ? or measles before applying a remedy . All this work is done at Juvenile Hall , where the child is brought on petition of his parents or others , and where he is kept till he has his hearing . The average length of stay runs from three to eleven days , though he always gets a hearing within three days ; he may he held there afterward for additional observation or treatment . " Juvenile Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built over a decade ago for a childre- jail , on old-style principles which included heavily-barred windows , dreary rooms , cells for solitary confinement , and all the other horrors of the earlier onception. while armed male guards stalked the place and kept terror in young hearts though they failed to frustrate insubordination , escapes , and scandals of every kind . Naturally , with this sort of equipment , the best of Juvenile judges could accomplish  | little of real value : so two years ago the Los Angeles fathers let down all the bars and invited women to go in and apply woman-sense to the management of youth all the way through . And I was to see what they had done . The buildings themselves are low-spreading and friendly , and on the exterior , at least , had needed little reconstruction . Vines climbed over windows , and flowers bloomed in the dooryard . We rang the bell . A pleasant-faced woman in nurse 's uniform opened the door and greeted us as any hostess might . We entered a lobby which gave an immediate impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered about , happy pictures were on the walls , and children 's laughter came in through the many windows , which opened on the play court . One could scarcely believe one was in a jail , and indeed the word is never used . So many of the old terrorizing words have . een inked out of the vocabulary here that the old terrorizing atmosphere seems completely inked out with them . And just as I was thinking how much there was in a name after all , the superintendent came to meet us , and 1 was again agreeably surprised , for the superintendent ? Doctor Marion Van Waters-is nothing but a splendidly cheerful , jolly , wise , and courageous college girl who got her Ph.D . a few years ago at Clark University , did Juvenile Court work in Boston and in Portland , Oregon , and then tackled her present job . She is really close enough to youth herself to be an ideal big-sister sort of companion to the older girls . Court Convenes in the Sitting-Room She promised to show me over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judge . She took me , however , for a peep into an adjoining *oom where the children waited . Several young girls were busy over their needlework , apparently perfectly at their ease , waiting for their hearings . The needlework ; the doctor explained , tended to take up their attention and keep them from getting nervous while they waited . Then we went into the court room . Court room , did I say ? Visit the children 's court ? and the grown-up court where children over sixteen are heard ? of your own town , you who read this story , and then come with me to this one . It was nothing but a homey-looking sitting-room , marked by harmonious colors and attractive pictures , with soft curtains in place of bars at the windows , and a huge bowl of roses in the center of the long library table , to one side of which the judge sat between the court reporter and the clerk ? both women . Not a man was in the room ; not a suggestion of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The doctor , who had now become bailiff , went to bring in the first case ; meanwhile the judge was reading the detailed report , which is really in the nature of a diagnosis , physically , mentally , and socially . John , aged nine , a squarely-built , solemn-eyed Russian , came in and took his seat opposite the judge . It seemed that John stayed out nights , and his mother had filed a petition to have him looked into . His sixteen-year-old sister was there to speak for the mother . " Well , John , " said the judge in a pleasant conversational tone , and smiling humanly at the little boy , " what 's the trouble ? Tell me all about it . " John told his troubles .. He did n't have many , or many words to tell them in : a man of the world , over-young , insisting on his rights , that was all : for John sold newspapers downtown nights , and when he got through he would put up at one of the newsies ' hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that John had twelve brothers and sisters and had to sleep with three of them , and he wanted a bed to himself .  | All right , the judge ruled , there was nothing unreasonable about that . John was doing his manly part in the work of the world and was entitled to a bed . A bed was ordered for him , and it was ordered kept clean and priv ate for John . He was sent home with this order to his parents , and the further provision that the court would supply the bed if the parents were not able to do so , but at all events John was to have his bed . The next was Jimmy , ten , , unruly , and refusing to obey his mother , there on her petition with his father in attendance . His diagnosis had shown an unusually bright child in perfect health , too lively for his tame environment . The judge talked it all over with him very seriously . Jimmy wanted to go back home more than anything else . She then made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil , she told him to write out all the things he meant to do and not to do , if allowed to go back home . Jimmy went to work , twisting his head to one side , thinking hard , and writing ' diligently . When he had finished , he handed his paper to the judge , who read it , agreed to its terms , and asked him to make another copy for.her . They both solemnly signed the compact . Jimmy put his in his pocket and went out with his father . The judge had talked with the father while Jimmy was writing , and told him to look up the Boy Scouts of his community and find , through their organization , a wholesome vent for the boy 's superabundant energies . " When he has said it , or written it out himself . " the judge explained as the door closed on father and son , " the compact becomes his code , and he is very apt to live up to it . Many people are making trouble in this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had never said it . they would never have done it . Likewise , when it 's an honorable statement that their lips utter , their lives are very apt to exemplify that . That is the chief value of a pledge . " @# El Retiro is a Reward for Merit Then there came in a plump , rosy , bristling haired , tempestuous young girl who had just one plea : " I want to go back to El Retiro : " And there was her mother , hysterical and backed up by sentimental neighbors who could n't bear to hear a mother moan and cry because she was separated from her child . The mother wanted the child to come home . a home from which she had been rescued because she had not had proper looking after . After hearing both mother and daughter , the mother getting more unreasonable and hysterical every minute , and the daughter more insistent , the judge kindly said : " Now , Polly , you take your mother outside and talk this all over with her , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go back to El Retiro , and see if you ca n't work it out together so she will he satisfied . " The two went out . Other young girls came in : would-be movie- $6.25 queens with beautiful eyes and Mary Pickford 6 ? curls who had been lured to the southwestern city by the dream of becoming stars with million-dollar incomes , and had fallen into bad hands . What with her climate and her movie studios , Los Angeles gets the nation 's problems . Young girls , unusually bright and attractive , with an instinct developed to its highest pitch at a time when they are least able to take care of it , move on Los Angeles in shoals . A few weeks of wandering from studio to studio , mid they are penniless ? often entirely alone- with no one to turn to for help , and naturally they become the prey of unscrupulous exploiters . With each of these young girls ? there were three ? the judge was as tender , as kind , and considerate as some elder sister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had her diagnosis , so the judge knew exactly the timber she was handling .  | " You are undernourished and very nervous . " she said to a girl of eighteen . " I think we will keep you here for a while and get you good and well ? put some more flesh on you ? and by that time we can get word to your father and see what is best . " Another , only fourteen , was badly diseased ; she was sent to the hospital for treatment . The third had nogparents . " How would you like to go to El Retiro to school ? " the judge asked her . Polly now came in , beaming , and leading her mother by the hand . She had won , and her mother was now satisfied to let her go , provided she could come home for Christmas , a promise the judge readily gave : As I watched the procedure through a long day , I discovered that no child or young person was ever convicted of a crime . The affair that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely a symptom of his situation , a manifestation that let the court into his condition and state of mind . He became a ward of the court ? the evidence being that he needed a guardian ? and the guardianship was looked upon as a sacred trust ; the court was now responsible for his future . To take care of this future , Los Angeles has provided suitable equipment : for the defective child there is an excellent school ; for the diseased , a hospital with standard equipment ; for unfit parents , a fund with which to board children in the country or send them to a good school . When parents are willing but unable to care for their children , they arc allowed $20 a month for each child to insure his proper feeding . In a serious case of undernourished condition , the child is kept at the Hall on a special diet ? with milk and raw eggs twice daily in addition to his daily pint of milk ? till his weight reaches normal . For cases needing discipline , there are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Reformatory for those over sixteen . For the girls there are similar provisions , ' witu the crowning glory of El Retiro . The big purpose back of all this investmentis reclama- tion , always reclamation . A good citizen is the state 's greatest asset , a bad one its greater ( liability ; and if you 're to make good citizens , you must catch them in the making . Laws Back up the Judges Judge Shontz has the advantage of laws that back up all this constructive work . There is one law to this effect : " Any person who commits any act or omits performance of any duty which tends to encourage any person under twenty-one to commit a wrongful act is guilty of a misdemeanor . " This gives her the necessary authority over parents , who are frequently brought in on contributory charges . They are not permitted , through ignorance , sentimentality , or an European conception cf property rights in the child , to mar his life . Neither can any Catholic , Protestant , or Jewish body say to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him . " The court says : " You had this child all his life up to the present , and here is the result . Now we will take charge . " In an hour or more 's tour over the Hall T visited the pleasant recreation rooms , the dining rooms with their tables daintily laid wit h silver , white linen , and flowers , the sunny schoolrooms , the small private bedrooms ? of what had once been a jail and was now a big . cheerful , overflowing sort of home ? with no armed male guard , with the old solitary cells turned into gymnasium lockers , with a swimming plunge , shower baths , and outdoor sleeping porches . I visited the garden , the poultry yard with its electric brooder and blooded stock ? many of these birds bringing $r3o apiece , and the yard yielding three hundred dozen eggs annually , all of which are used for the children in the Hall ; the pigs ? the Hall j realized $67o last year , from pigs that cost virtually nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-provisioning home going on in the most scientific way , and all of it the work of the children under the leadership of women . I visited the nursery where babies of domestic friction are cared for , treated , and provided with outdoor playgrounds , sand-piles , swings , story tellers , and a trained nurse assisted by the pure young girls who find their way into the Hall ; the hospital . the dental clinic , the o : ofdoor dental lavatory , and the " egg-nog kitchen " where romping , sweating youngsters file up from their play twice daily for this extra nourishment of pure rich milk and eggs , sweetened and beaten to a delicious foam . " We make the child conscious , " the doctor explained , " that there is a problem and that we are trying to solve it , and we do it in a way that will get his cooperation . There is little Tony who was thirty pounds underweight , putting on flesh regularly every day now and tremendously interested watching his curve rise . Each child has his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves how they are gaining , and they invariably get interested in doing the things that will make them big and strong . in the new interest they forget the djstructive naughtiness that brought them here , and in the new health their nerves are quieted , they sleep , and they become normal in their tendencies . " It was charming to see the way all these youngsters greeted the doctor , hurrying to meet her , the little ones throwing their arms about her ; while it was " Oh , doctor ? " this , and " Oh , doctor ? " that , all the long way . And from the doctor toward them was unfailing courtesy , chivalry , and consideration . I beg your pardon , " she'said , opening the door of a big boy up for burglary and finding him unexpectedly in . Her attitude toward them in their own particular private quarters was exactly what she would expect from them on entering hers . One young girl we found waiting alone in her room , but she looked up and smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that this girl had telephoned to her the night before please to come and get her . She had got into a difficult position , and not knowing how else to escape , had thought of Juvenile Hall . not as a place to fear , but as a place of refuge . And this is the attitude the doctor and the judge constantly seek to establish . They want to break down completely the old-time dread of the court and its prescriptions . They want every young person in Los Angeles to feel that here they will get a square deal . Juvenile Hall is Cheaper than the Jail It is a big story in itself , this story of Juvenile Hall , and the result of putting mother-hearted women in the place of an armed male guard . It must not be inferred , however , that no men are employed . There are four : a storekeeper , an attendant for the large boys ? they are sent to the Hall for all crimes but murder , up to twenty-one ? his relief , and a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilled mechanic , an ex-seaman , and was at one time a teacher of boxing to English boys . He became converted to Christian ideals and offered himself for the work for rehabilitation among the older boys at Juvenile Hall . He superintends their work , their sports , teaches then to box ; and needless to say , the boys adore him , looking upon him as a hero . No uniforms are worn here , though the boys generally prefer the Boy Scout suits and the girls , middy blouse school dresses . They can choose what they please . And ? for these who think best in dollars and cents ? all this change to human , kindly , curative living with women in charge of every detail ? even the buying of the stores and the disposal of the crops ? costs actually less per capita per day , now in the high cost of living era , than did the old-time management . The cost now averages $1.26 per capita , while the old-time , pre-war cost was $1.30 per capita.  | and the average institutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I must tell you , if only a little . about El Retiro , that pleasant , Spanish name that kept bobbing up all day in the Court . EI Retiro is the new school estal lished for supernormal girls , those brightminded , adventurous-natured girls who are bound to get into trouble over the misuse of their energies if there is no strong guiding hand at the helm . This is the first really constructive work ever started for girls of inherent ability but handicapped by fate . It is an honor to go to El Retiro , for it means that you have tested above the average and are an unusually good prospect for useful womanhood . The doctor took me to visit the school the following day . twenty-three miles up the San Fernando valley , along a way of pepper trees and palms , and over a road like glass , surrounded by the beauty that is Southern California ? orange groves dripping with golden fruit , olive groves jewelled in purple , the valley closed in by tawny hills , and beyond , the sky-piercing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted to olives and now in full hearing . The main building is of the pleasing . low-spreading bungalow type , spacious and many-windowed , while grouped to the rear are twenty or more small outdoor bungalows , each one a little individual home with sleeping-room in the open . bath , and all modern conveniences . And these are the homes of the students , every one with her own little house , hers to keep , to beautify , to love , and snuggle up in , where she may feel that she has a place in the world all her very own . Each Girl Has a Home of Her Own The doctor had stopped the car near the little bungalows , so we visited them first . There are no keys at El Retiro . We opened doors and went into one after another , for the girls were at their lessons ; and such neatness and orderliness as we found , such immaculate linen and bureau drawers . Mottoes , pennants , and pictures adorned the walls ; a kodak was here , a big doll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the various girlhood types but everything so beautifully kept ! I wondered just what that degree of cleanliness and order , liness might do for the young of the nation if applied to all the private homes . These girls do their own housekeeping under efficient training , inspection , and competition . We went on and saw the garden , the cowyard ? scarcely less immaculate than the girls ' own quarters , and kept by them . We visited the electrically equipped laundry , the fruit cellar well stored with the work of the students , the long , light , airy kitchen with its electric range , its tireless cooker ? every convenience for securing the best results with the least friction and labor . And then we came on around to the main part of the building and went into the lobby , which gave the same general impression of comfort and hominess . And here at last we saw the real product of all this excellent equipment ? the girls themselves : just natural , happy , lively girls from fourteen to eighteen , talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation hour preceding lunch . It was pe fectly evident that there was no old-fashioned domesticity about El Retiro. the kind that put the care of the house first and left the caretakers tired , worn drudges , that thing that has made women flee the home . These girls . attractively dressed , turned as we entered , and several came forward at once to greet the doctor , pleasure in their faces . I met and talked with every one of them=I think there were twenty ? and they were all eager . bright-minded , meaning to make good , reach for suggestions . Some wanted to be writers and asked all sorts of questions about real editors and magazines and authors . Others wanted to be business women ; one , a physician ; another , a musician ; another , a proba-  | live . The guardianship continues as long as the girl needs it . " In other words , at El Retiro the work of the hands is perfectly coordinated with that of the brain ; an hour of digging in good mother earth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry . The girl is made to see the dignity of labor , that culture of the hands must go along with culture of the mind , if one is not to be lopsidedly developed . No graduate of El Retiro ? for they will have their regular graduation , with diplomas , class pins , and every thing ? will ever go helpless through life . She will stand , a regal figure , balancing the work of her brain and her hands , respecting one quite as much as the other , because she will have learned the beauty of all work when done with skill and understanding . Now , does n't it look hopeful , this one complete demonstration of the good results of applying woman-judgment to the case of youth all the way through ? Does n't the old destructive method of the courts ? punishment for the sake of example ? seem barbaric in comparison ? And ca n't you see the splendid work of all these other women judges as just so many entering wedges into a better day when there will be reconstructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , men as well as women ? Perhaps it is given only to women fully to realize that the child starts out virtually a little animal and is gradually made into a human being through the experience that life furnishes him . At first he is plastic and receptive , all potentiality ; later , he merely throws back upon the world the fruit of the seeds that were planted . If this fruit is to be wholesome , there must be wholesome seeds . Only divine mother-sense , perhaps , fully realizes that much apparent bad is after all only superabundant energy gone wild . The child who never does any so-called " bad " thing is not very apt to contribute anything particularly valuable , later . He may be good ? but good for what ? Society progresses through the rightly directed energy of the little window-smasher . All greatness comes out of struggle . Mother-sense knows , then , that the thing is not to repress and restrain and crowd down until there is conventional behavior through the force of overhead power , a process which all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the co-operation of the spirit of the child through a right employment of his energies and a wise direction of his thoughts , and help him to grow from the inside out into a correct understanding of life and his obligations to society . And ? to the mother-spirit ? the grown-up is only a big child needing equally humane handling for worth-while results . @#
