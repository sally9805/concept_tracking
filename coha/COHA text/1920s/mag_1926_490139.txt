WE HAVE had our ear to the ground and think we detect the presence of an increasing number of pineapples in New York . Stands which formerly sold orange juice now offer the sickly squeezings of this prickle from the tropics . inasmuch as we do n't happen to like pineapple we have managed to recollect that the wholesale importation of sweetish tropical fruits has always been one of the signs of a decaying civilization . Remembering Rome , New York had better watch out . IT IS hard to tell when one is going 1-to reach a momentous decision . The other day as we paused in front of the London Dog Shop wishing we were a Chow puppy , on one side of us stood a little girl cooing with innocent delight and on the other a little girl sobbing with chagrin and covetousness . And right then and there we decided that had we been ten years younger and had they been ten years older and had all of us been unmarried , we should have taken to wife the cooing one rather than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ham sandwich in a polo box at Meadow Brook is paying for a purchase in Woolworth 's with a ten-dollar bill . They ring a bell . They actually do . It seems that sales girls may not handle such large sums , for no sooner had we tendered the pretty black and yellow ten-dollar note in payment for a red mouse trap than the girl pounded on a bell and shrilled loudly for Mr. Kempler , Mr. Kernpler . Pretty soon Mr. Kempler came , took hold of the situation , and in less than five ininutes , we fought our way out through admiring throngs , with nine dollars and ninety cents in change , half expecting the crowd to break out and cheer us to the echo SIGNS of the changing season are SIGNS plentiful . A thief broke into a tailor 's store on Forty-fifth Street last week and took one winter suit  --  n()tiling else . THIS is a wonderful age , no doubt , but there are some things about it we do n't like . One concerns the New York Central railroad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hudson , you will see great all-Pullman trains flash by . The earth trembles with them . Where used to sit the engineer , his face streaked with soot , his eyes hawklike , his visor pulled low , his hand firm upon the throttle , now sits a complacent , bored , straw-hatted individual chewing gum , his hand on an electric switch . AFINAL echo of the fight comes from a sporting friend . " At last , " he announced , " we 've found a name for the last puppy of the litterTunney . " It is a euphonious and usable canine cognomen and , to our minds , one good dog named Tunney is a more flattering reflection of glory for the new champion to contemplate than all the little Genes whose arrivals in the city 's hospitals the newspapers have been announcing .

" Now , " said Mr. Griffith during recent shots of a cer-tain love scene , " I want you to reg-ister a cold , white , icy passion in this scene , superbly reserved and repressed . " Whereat the actress clutched the lead-ing man in such wise that he uttered a scream and rushed from the set . THE NEW YORKER Three stitches had to be taken in his lip . This matter of coaching performers recalls the old one of the actor who was asked to give a " full , rounded , rolling tone " to a line .

" " Chicago " THE usually imperturbable theatri-THE producer , Mr. Sam H. Harris , is reported in a state of embarassment . It is a : fair , soft-spoken , but caustic young newcomer from Kentucky who has achieved the feat of embarrassing him . He has already accepted her first play , a mean , withering , and , report says , brilliant comedy about a gaudy murder trial , a satire nicely calculated , one would think , to provoke at least a faint discomfort in any American community . But , just as a gratuitous parting shot , she has been so impolitic as to call her piece " Chicago . " Mr. Harris ' admiration for the play is warm but , after all , he has business interests in Chicago and would like to be able to drop out there from time to time without adding to the familiar depression of such a pilgrimage the disquieting prospect of being obliged to join our feathered friends . The present odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , but under the title , " The Brave Little Woman . " The nature of the play can be gathered from the fact that the cast of characters describes its heroine as the prettiest girl ever tried , for murder in Chicago . There is said to be one affecting scene in the detention room where four lady murderesses compare scrapbooks . Maurine Watkins , who wrote it , was once a newspaper reporter in Chicago . She is blonde , comely , chic , and considerably under thirty  --  a pleasant way to be . They say the leading role was offered to Miss Jeanne Bagels , who is in the painful plight of needing a part which will not seem too precipitous a descent from the giddy heights of Sadie Thompson in " Rain . " She declined to appear in " Chicago " but softened her refusal by immediately offering to finance its entire production out of her own pocket if only they would give her half the profits .

No repairs were being made and the American was puzzled . " Oh , that often happens , " explained his Italian companion . " You see , Mussolini lives in that square and whenever he wants to work , he just closes the traffic in all the streets approaching his palace . He does n't like noise . " Funeral THAT picturesque and historic old edifice at the corner of Bleecker and Downing streets known as the Church of Our Lady of Pompeii , has been the scene of what is probably its last enormous and spectacular funeral . The services held there for Little Italy 's beloved " Dr. John " Perilli and the procession in which several hun- ? ? dred , automobiles and thousands of marchers participated , was its own funeral as well . It is to be razed within a month that Sixth Avenue may continue southward as far as Laight Street  --  an extension designed to be an aid to traffic . Once the home of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pompeii for years now has been the religious and social center of Little Italy . Wedding automobiles have lined the curb in front of the church , rubbing wheels with pushcarts , and stared into by all of the million children of the neighborhood . Any one who was any one in Little Italy was married from Our Lady of Pompeii . All the processions for the fiesta days started there , the effigies of innumerable saints were carried through the church 's doors . And of course , ' all of Little Italy 's funerals were held there : The Italian brass band , and the long procession of mourners first followed the casket out of the church to there begin their long , sorrowful march to the grave . The new Church of Our Lady is already planned and the site purchased on Carmine Street , but the charming old temple can scarcely be replaced so easily nor will its situa-tion be duplicated on the oblique angle of its narrow old-world street .

Union Square , yes ; Washington Square , yes ; the Public Library , yes ; but not , until now , the Plaza . They are on the average about four feet tall , though most people tell us they prefer to employ those of three feet and under . When they have become extended to five feet they disappear into the entrails of the Grand Central Station or the Astor Hotel . They are one of the most charming bits of New York color , and it is always regrettable ( for what is education any way ? ) when school thins out their numbers as it did last week . They are sublimely indifferent to anything above the ankle . And now at least one of them has pushed as far north as the Plaza . Whether this means that the uptown valets are beginning to fall down on their jobs , we do not know . We shall await further advices .

" Number , Please WE HAVE had occasion , before this , to comment on the valiant but unsuccessful efforts made by Mrs. Robert Bacon to preserve for her own use the number , " 1 Park Avenue , " for the old red-brick mansion at the northeast Thirty-fourth Street curnen The Board of Aldermen having awarded the number to a large business building a few blocks farther down on what used ' m be the northern end of Fourth Avenue but is now.the southern end of Park Avenue , Mrs. Bacon has a further grievance .

" Heart Throb SUBSCRIBERS to the daily pa-pers may have come to believe that " sob stories " are manufactured , but here is a true one . Petey is back in his cage in an office on the seventeenth story of an office building in the West Forties , and happiness again reigns among the stenogs and clerks . Peter is a canary who suddenly appeared from no one know where one hot day not so long ago , and was received with open arms by the business world . He was very tired , as though he had flown a long distance . One of the office boys made him a temporary cage out of a cardboard box and the next day every one , including the boss , chipped in . and bought the little fellow a gorgeous cage . They do things well when they do them in the business world . Then one morning black tragedy stalked into the office . One of the girls , as girls are , was unable to resist the temptation to stroke Petey 's downy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door a bit too wide . In an instant there was a flash and he was gone  --  seventeen stories above the ground . For a single instant he poised , hesitating , on the window ledge , and then fluttered away into the cruel world . Some of the girls did not go out to lunch that day but remained in the office to lament . But Petey 's fame had spread , and that afternoon two girls employed in the same building were waiting on Fifth Avenue for the lights to change . One of them , glancing down at the curb , caught sight of a bit of yellow . It was a canary . They caught it without difficulty , and knowing of the lamentations on the seventeenth floor took it up for identification . It was Petey sure 20 THE NEW YORKER enough  --  and the cheering , they say , was heard in the street . Cheerio ! Paramount Theatre MORE AND more it becomes certain that the Paramount Valhalla on Times Square , which the public will look into for the first time soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that the moving picture industry can make it . In addition the lobby , which , of course , will he five stories high , and the auditorium with an orchestra pit arranged on a huge elevator so that it can appear and disappear when the movie magnate waves his wand and cries " Hokuml " , there are to he twenty-six lounge rooms where patrons can meet friends and relatives before the FA-fart/lance . These are to be elaborately decorated in sundry fashions . There will be a University Room , Fraternity Room , a Marie Antoinette Room , an Elizabethan Room , a Della Robbia Room , and so forth . It is well known that patrons of the motion picture are becoming so sensitive and cultured that it would n't do to make them meet just anywhere , and that they must be supplied with rendezvous suited to their testy preferences . The cynical are always with us , however , and we did hear one say that most movie fans would think Della Robbia Room means Dressing Room in Italian and that this particular lounging place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ritz might envy will be the " longest rug in the world " which at the present writing is being woven by Czecho-Slovaks in their native mountains . It will grace the floor of the balcony foyer . Of somewhat less concern to the upper class is the fact that the floor of the stage will be made of a special material warranted not to run splinters into the feet of barefoot dancers . Ushers will be dressed in maroon uniforms and will salute upon receiving ticket stubs . Female patrons going in may experience the exquisite sensation of imagining they are the wives of army officers . We are further told that the authorities are going to take to heart the sad experience of a theatre in Chicago ; the ushers ' salute will not be too military . When saluting-ushers first became the fad ) the movie people ? naturally concluded that the thing to do was to glorify the salute to the nth power ; so they hired a West Point cadet and told him to " make the boys salute  --  it do n't cost any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and formal that the public suspected that it was being high-hatted instead of being treated ritzy . At the new Paramount the ushers will salute informally . Last but not least of this wonder-building 's beauties is a clock on the summit , which is to be such a wonderful clock that we are afraid no one will be able to tell time by it . It will be the largest glass ball in the world . Merry Mermaid THOUGH the Newport season is practically over , ocean bathing has continued popular there and , Consequently , a certain party of young revellers , tiring of the pomp and fashion of Bailey 's Beach , decided to find a more secluded spot and swim through water , not seaweed . Motoring to a far-away sunny beach , they climbed from their cars and , clad in bathing suits , made for the pleasant water . Suddenly , rounding a sand dune , they spied a well-known and somewhat ancient Newport bachelor and two men dressed in chauffeurs ' uni ? forms standing nervously around a red-striped , collapsed tent . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kicking , bare foot protruded . With every bound the three men winced , yet continued to remain at a distance . Suddenly the tent gave a mighty heave . " I ca n't find my clothes and I ca n't find my bathing suit , " came a loud voice . Then the tent flap parted and out poked the tousled head of one of Newport 's hest-known dowagers . She , ton , accompanied by chauffeur , Footman and gallant escort , had had the idea of seeking a secluded beach . But unfortunately her tent had collapsed at the crucial moment and , under the circumstances , no one could go to the rescue . Gangway EVEN AT this date we ca n't re-sist telling a Krishnamurti story .

Whereat the trembling copy reader explained that the thing had gone through at the last moment and that he had thought a sub-editor had told him the caption was satisfactory .

Send a copy boy out and buy him son-ie teeth and charge it to the office . " Story About a Story RECENTLY a certain general , well-known as a raconteur , went to Pelham and told a story to some gentlemen which , it is rumored , forced three clergymen to leave the room . Somehow the story crossed the gulf between the sexes , and a few days afterwards in New York alady coyly approached the general . " Tell us , General , " she begged ; and when he professed innocence , " Tell us the story that drove out  --  you know . The one about " " I swear I do n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You tell me .

Old Regime A REAL BIT of old New York is not so easily found these days , but there is a restaurant on University Place called The Old Farm and run by one Bill Pause . Once upon a time , in Bill 's father 's red-blooded day , sailors , authors arid statesmen regaled themselves in this jolly cellar on things far stronger than ginger ale . We happened in there a few nights ago carrying a cane and were rather nonplused to have Bill acknowledge our greeting with the obstreperous question : " Whatcha Join ' with that damn stick ? " Theodore Roosevelt was a frequent patron of the place , we were told , as were also F. G. Atwood , John Kendrick Bangs , John Taylor Johnston , Allan Thorn-dike Rice , Roscoe P. Conkhng , John Raines , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankrolls there for safe keeping during shine leave , and Bill kept some seventy-five suits of civics upstairs for the convenience of the boys . Now that Volstead has swept the land and sailors drink malted milk , Bill finds himself much alone , with one shell-shocked Russian waiter and a nephew of P. T. Barnum . No lover of the old regime has clung more desperately to the past than Pause . For instance , though far from prosperous , he still charges thirty-five cents for a dinner , the reason being that his father charged thirty-five cents . It has been a brave struggle which brought him twelve times in conflict with prohibition agents and to final defeat last year . One memorable night in 1925 , the famous bar , handed down from father to son , was removed . An odd-job carpenter dismantled it and reduced it to firewood . On the night this occurred , Bill , an abject figure in a dim corner of the restaurant , tears streaming down his face , sat rocking to and fro with the plate from his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is old prints . He showed us his rare collection , among which were some charming ones of the New York City Fire Department in action during the eighties , those good old days when fires were fires . More unique than prints , however , is Sam Barnum , Bill 's sagacious henchman . This nephew of the famous P. T. , is a college graduate . Now he does chores for Bill , mends windows , paints walls and earns his board and keep . Also Sam talks . The other night , his thesis was a trip to the Klondike with Rider Haggard , a long drawn out tale of arctic told , shortage of food , and a free-for-all fight over the last pot of jam , in the midst of which Haggard 's beard became entangled in Sam 's shoes . A fit tale , indeed , for a Barnum to tell in the Victorian atmosphere of the Old Farm .
