A Note on Ulysses ONE of the most curious indirect effects of the ap-pearance of Ulysses was to show that in literature our age was far more opulent and revolutionary than one had thought . It not only threw open a new kingdom of life in doing so ; it gave a key to a body of literature already in existence which prophesied in dim semis the advent of that kingdom . It breathed meaning into works which were to most people without significance and yet interesting , they did not know why . It gave a richer content to the poetry of writers like Miss Edith Sitwell , whose genius people acknowledged while it puzzled them , and to that of Mr. T. S. Eliot , who seemed to be penetrating more deeply into pedantic and barren places of the mind and did this by revealing encyc/opxclically the uncharted province on which they had been working ; but chiefly it provided in itself a central work in whose shadow the lesser achievements of the age shone for the first time with their fall lustre . It put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graves , Mrs. Virginia Woo/f , and half-a-dozen other writers in their places , and it gave them a rank higher than as solitary , unrelated peaks they would have had , making possible for the first time a real criticism of their work ; for Ulysses was the earliest assertion in art of the value by which they were to be appraised . It gave a new prominence to Mr. D. H. Lawrence , whom mast people had regarded as the alternative to Mr. Joyce : he re-appeared , in spite of Ulysses , and because of it , a great writer , less than his rival , but somehow by the individuality of his expression evading compar And the more faunal but exquisite talents of the time-Mr . Lytton Strachey , Mr. David Garnett , ? sparkled more convincingly now that we could regard them as ornaments rather than luminaries . One great writer and an abundance of brilliant but secondary talents is enough to make what is called in literature a great period , and by virtue of these the literature of the English speaking peoples ismore opulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The generation of Mr. Shaw , Mr. Wells , Mr. Conrad and Mr. Bennett could show no book like Ulysses , no figure like Mr. Lawrence ; it had nothing of the first rank . Our age possesses a work of the first rank and , what is almost as important , a number of works of the second and third . Ulysses showed the direction in which literature for ten years had been moving ; it showed also the direction , or rather some of the directions , in which , perhaps for ten times ten , it will move . Into it various currents , Irish , cosmopolitan , personal , came together , and out of it they issued again clarified and ' transformed . Analysing Ulysses one could have drawn a chart of the future of literature , showing not only what would be attempted , but aim what with good luck would be achieved ; or rather one could have done so if among the various streams collected together M Ulysses there had not been one , and the most potent , which , mingling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occult . This was Mr. Joyce 's genius , over which nobody but himself had control . For the rest he not only hammered out a new grammar of literary art in Ulysses ; he discovered a new field of aesthetic experience ( a field on which others had labored without knowing what it was ) ; and to describe it he invented a magic of speech unessayed for centuries , and never before essayed on consciously . It was because he went back so far to the fundamentals of art that his book had its enigmatic , primal atmosphere , and seemed , in spite of its modernity , hoary with years . One did not know whether to be astonished most by Mr. Joyce 's systematic method or his discoveries , by his discoveries or his inventions . As a conscious practician of art Ile was not only accomplished , he was masterly ; as a discoverer of hidden riches he was as mighty in his own field as Dostoyevsky was in his ; in his evocation of the hidden magic of words he stood by himself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which artists would for some time express is He found the language for which Mr. George Moore made an unsuccessful voyage to Dublin , but which was there , and in other parts of the world , all the time . He evoked in certain collocations of words a malignant necromancy such as poets have found in certain landscapes , calling out their hidden evil . That his magic was always black magic was the chief sign of his limitation as an artist . He was concerned with the roots of life and not with its flowering ; and where life has not yet blossomed , where the unconscious has not yet freed and attenuated itself in the con- scious , as for example in the lives of primitive peoples , in our dreams , in our blind desires , all magic is black magic . Mr. Joyce went over the conscious life of men like a plough and showed the richness of the soil ; and Ulysses gives no the sense of Hack magic which ploughed fields sometimes evoke . This feeling is probably a racial memory of times which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upturned earth was an image to men of blasphemous violation and of inexplicable increase . But everything in Ulysses has this mythical quality , and the humor is , like that of primitive peoples , the humor of size . Whatever validity there may be philosophically in Mr. Joyce 's symbolical construction , in which each part of the book represents an organ of the human body , and the whole thy human form divine , its humorous virtues are to clear that they leap out and strike the eye . Mr. Bloom is conceived on such an extravagant scale that he gives the effect of one of those Brobdignagians who to Gulliver must have had the appearance of a landscape with spreading plains , rising peaks , thick woods and flowing streams . Now and they a single feature springs into grotesque prominence ; we regard a nose as big as the side of a mountain , we climb over it , survey it , measure it ; we see cheeks swelling like hills , eyes gleaming like lakes , the mouth a vast red crevice with a horrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard things in this may was a secret of primitive humor , and it found expression in the preoccupation of early man with giants and with the vast creatures which we call dragons ; for these had an aspect comical as well as dreadful . It is the method which Mr. Joyce practises on Leopold Bloom , going back here , Alm , to the sources of aesthetic emotion . In Ulysses he has sounded , for the first time since Rabelais , all the stops of humor ; and Mr. Bloom is one of the greatest comic figures in liter- ature , as great as Falstaff . He is humorous not only iw the tricks of his temperament and his mind , but like Falstaff in those of his body ; and it is an artistic heresy to hold that the body is unworthy the regard of the comic spirit , and that Falstaff 's belly had any less right to aesthetic expression than the lids of Juno 's eyes . Asa comic figure Mr. Bloom is so completely , on magnificently shown , that in regard-ing him we seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the processes of life . Mr. Joyce has pursued comedy down to its source , penetrating to the cells , to the dust out of which man rises . Through its minuteness his humor attains the cosmiml , and gives one the feeling that not only men could feel warmed by it , but all the forms of that nature in which copulation and reproduction are so omnipotent . It is a humor entirely of the earth , as perhaps all humor is . It is a humor , too , in which extravagance is reinstated after being banished for a long time as childish and contrary to mature taste , In primitive humor there is always mmeshing outrageous , and the humorist not only discloses the foibles and indecencies of his audience but flaunts his own , piling them up in a mountain and squatting upon it . This humor was an intellectual parody of the saturnalia , a little mare wild in its imaginary excesses than the original . It w. a great emotional and intellectual release , and it carried with it a total abnegation of dignity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh re tamed a sober countenance , admitting no fellowship with the frailties and lusts which in describing he satirised or excused . This has been the fashion of the last three centuries , a polite fashion in which the original flavor of humor was refined away . Comedy in this style amused men and made them resigned to their lot , thus fulfilling both a social and an ethical purpose ; but it no longer gave them release . It was something different from humor in its first rude state , its restraint and economy where originally means they had been extravagance and grotesque abundance . Disregarding the fashion of centuries Mr. Joyce has recaptured the boundlessness of primitive humor and has set laughter back on its roots . He has not been ashamed to play the clown , to resurrect the mock-heroic , which everybody thought was safely buried , and to practise parody , which nobody considered a form worth the notice of an artist of serious purpose . And to all these he has given new significance , proving their possibilities , carrying them by that sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmic absurdity . The part of Ulysses where the thoughts af Gerry MacDowell are presented in the manner of a penny novelette is not only parody ; it is a unique and poignant form of expression , a doubly indirect , a multiple utterance , in which almost everything is left to be implied and the triteness of the words conceals half-a-dozen meanings , some of them of an ethereal beauty . In handling subject-matter so trivial and so hackneyed as this Mr. Juice shows most dearly the originality of his mind and the incisiveness of his art . His parodies of the daily newspapers do not merely amuse ; they evoke a gigantic image of the fatuity of the mind . Things which we accept with an ineradicable laziness as modes he portrays as aspects of a profound folly , a still more profound stupidity ; and , recognizing that it is not the press but the human intellect that he is parodying , we are not merely diverted , we are amazed . He uses parody as a means of anatomising the mind , showing that it , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavoidable , in spite of its dignity , as those of the body ; and by an extravagance calculated in its seeming excess he reaches the essential in a new way . And he has discovered anew the mystical power of extravagance in itself , scarcely recognized by anyone since Rabelais ; and in the pub scene he has carried it to the length where nonsense has a meaning . But as if in doing all these things he had not done enough he has described dearly for the first time the realm only half-glimpsed by writers such as . Mr. D. H. Law- rence , Mr. Sherwood Anderson and Miss Dorothy Richard- son . He has revealed the swarming world of sub-conscious and half-conscious thoughts which constitute three-fourths of our life , and he has shown that it has a magical and excessive beauty . In hardly any other work of modern times is there such an overpowering sense of the inexhaustibility of human life , a sense of richness which may well be too strong for the literati . Whether he has succeeded in articulating completely a new world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one feels that here and there he has won only an approximate success ; but that he has achieved so much is astonishing . Hell . made at least a rough anatomy of the dark god whom Mr. Lawrence sees only in glimpses and mentions only in hints ; and if the outline is cloudy it is chiefly because the lineaments are huge . In Ulysses the total articulation of the sub-conscious body of man is obscured by the separate features , but by study if not by intuition they can be put together . The separate merits of the book we can apprehend immediately as we apprehend anything that in art is beautiful , but to appreciate its total beauty we have to draw upon reflection . This fault Ulysses has ; it has another which is more serious . For such a huge and multifarious work it is too continuously on one key . Rabelais , whom Mr. Joyce recalls constantly , wrote encyclopsedically and minutely of the physical part of man , but he wrote also of man 's spiritual part , giving it , too , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanly satisfying . Mr. Joyce is encydopmlic ; he is learnedly minute ; his hook is , what Rabelais 's works were not , firmly and severely constructed ; but he is not satisfying for u because one part of life he almost completely ignores ; and by its one of relief Ulysses sometimes oppresses us : the complementary part of our nature is interdicted expression . Mr. Joyce 's masterpiecehas neither the breadth one the sanity of superior comic art ; its richness is not quite that of nature : the atmosphere is overheated , and the horizon is too narrow for the objects which are crowded into it , In Ulysses life presses in too closely upon no on even : side . too closely for us to see it dearly . That is as much as to say that Mr. Joyce has not won a omplete artistic triumph over his subject-matter . Butc this attempt is great , and his measure of succe. , considering the magnitude of the task , astonishing . No imaginative work of our time has in it m much of the occult and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought literary art back to its sources , and he has remained at them , drawing continuously from the fountainhead . The book has the quality which the Germans call ursprunglich ; it is not a new mode of art , but rather a fundamental assertion of it . Consequently 410 work of our time has to completely the atmosphere and the authority of a scripture . It is the full utterance , enigmatic but not to be ignored , of one man . And like all scriptures it contains within it a principle of differentiation ; many streams lead out from it , and it may well became the central point of a literature . The danger is not that it will remain unrecognized , but that in time it will overshadow every other potentiality of our age . Yet , though it may fetter the talents of a few artists , to the many it will give a clear road and their oitimetunity . On every side it is a beginning , and a beginning is what our generation has chiefly desired ,       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
