One of the strangest pieces of mail which Senator Robinson of Arkansas , the U. S. Vice-President-Reject , has ever received , was a letter which he gleefully showed to colleagues last week . The letter warmly , sincerely , personally thanked Mr. Robinson for " the cordial support you gave me in the campaign . " It was signed by Charles Curtis , the Vice-President-Elect . Senator Curtis laughed as hard as anyone . No one in the Senate needed to be told how it is that such slips occur when one answers each &; every one of one 's congratulaters after an election by warm , sincere , personal form-letters.
