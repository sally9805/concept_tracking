As thousands and thousands had safely done before , 14 people went up sightseeing in a trimotored Ford plane at the Newark , N , J. , airport last week . Motor trouble developed . The pilot tried a forced landing near railroad tracks . He could not prevent his machine , which was traveling 70 m. p. h. , from smashing into a gondola filled with sand . All the passengers were killed . It was the worst air accident in U. S. history .
