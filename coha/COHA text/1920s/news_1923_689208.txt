txt Prohibition and Other Laws . To the Editor of The New York Times : In the articles of Commissioner Haynes on prohibition enforcement there is a dominant note which so far has escaped criticism . viz : His utter disregard for all law except the law he is given to try to enforce . The prohibition law does appear to supersede all other 1/rw ? being so conspicuously placed on the Constitution . Does It supersede the security of life ? Does Its violation involve the death penalty without trial ? Does It supersede the Ten Commandments , which are the the base of the Constitution and law of all other nations ? Is Mr. Haynes justified In carrying on a civil war against those who fully believe they have a moral if not also a legal right to possess and transport certain goods ? In any case it would be interesting to know how many men are under arms . How many have been killed and wounded on both sides . And when this disgusting state of affairs may be expected to end .
