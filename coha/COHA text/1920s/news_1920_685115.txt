txt Without striking a single blow in its defense , the Socialist Democratic Catholic ' regime has fallen , and as I write Berlin is completely in the hands of the new Government , headed by Dr. Kapp . It has been an amazing day and an extraordinary revolution . Tonight I am writing this message at 9 o'clock  --  the city wears quite a normal aspect , save that there is some barbed wire about the main streets and soldiers with artillery and machine guns are still posted at commanding points in the centre of the city . The restaurants are a : , full and as gay tonight as ever , and , although the dancing palaces have been closed , the theatres remain open and attract the usual audiences . But , to go back to the beginning of the coup , the movement had been very carefully prepared . It had its headquarters at ** where lay the marine division , under Captain Ehrhardt , and other u : ts . Not till yesterday , afternoon did the old Government inform the public ti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended move . It then issued a communique which was so optimistic and misleading that practically all Berlin went to bed last night thinking that the Government had the situation well in hand . But toward midnight of Friday and Saturday Herr Noske began distributing his troops . Through and among the sparse night traffic there rolled armored cars and field kitchens . I saw armed troops in full kit marching through the chief thoroughfares , and artillery and machine guns were much in evidence . I have since learned that the plans of the conspirators at Dtiberitz had been betrayed , but the heads of the movement there decided that they would not postpone their attempt . An ultimatum was sent the Government  --  I now write of the old regime ? demanding a new Government , and new elections and the withdrawal of the warrants issued against Dr. Kapp and others . Cabinet Tried to Negotiate . The Cabinet met to deliberate on the matter and made an attempt to negotiate , sending , according to the Tageblatt , Admiral von Trotha to DOberitz . There , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new rebel ultimatum was delivered , demanding the resignation of the entire Ebert Government by 7 o'clock in the morning . Failing that , a force would advance and occupy Berlin . On the receipt of this information another Cabinet meeting was held at an early hour this morning . It had then become clear that the Govern ; ment had not a sufficiently strong military force behind it to put up any effective resistance . When I was in the streets at 2 o'clock this morning I saw several detachments of soldiers leave their posts . It was said that orders had been received to move all troops eastward . I learned later , however , that the Government had ordered its forces to withdraw and to make no resistance . The DOberitz force set out on its march toward Berlin at midnight and a little before 6 o'clock this morning the main-body reached the wide space behind the Brandenburg Gate . There a halt was called till the time limit of the ultimatum had expired . No hitch in Rebels ' Program , So far the plans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There has not been the slightest trouble . In the centre of the city the people treated the day as a holiday . The big crowds which kept on parading the streets till late In the afternoon were not hustled about by the military or police , but were allowed to satisfy their curiosity to the full , and passed their time discussing the dra- matic and sudden upheaval . The midday papers issued vast editions , but , with all their efforts to meet the demand , each copy had to serve for a small crowd . Occasionally in the course of the afternoon there were military demonstrations on a small scale . A small tank , for instance , would go down linter den Linden , while handbills were distributed to . the people ; but nothing in the nature of speechmaking to large crowds , as in the revolution of November , 1918 , has taken place . Business went on everywhere practically as usual . On the Boerse there was an inevitable decline in the mark , the quotation for the pound sterling dropping from 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a somewhat anxious day . It is stated that a general strike will begin and will extend even to the waiters in hotels and restaurants . Indeed , it is reported that the last act of the Government under Chancellor Bauer was to proclaim a general strike to begin Sunday . The means of communication , however , have not so far been disturbed in any way . As the day wore on the scenes in the central streets became much more animated . Unter den Linden and the Wilhelmstrasse are commanded at either end by artillery , . and on several Government buildings the marine flag has been hoisted . Additional c:Irces continue to arrive , and it is delared that the bulk of Noske 's troops : lave already gone over to the new ? egime . The Wilhelmplatz , in the entre of the Government quarter of he city , looks like a military eneinipment . One of the first acts of the new 3overnment was to issue a proclamaion over the name of Dr. Kapp as Imperial Chancellor . Negotiations are going on between the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend upon the result . Dr. Kapp , the new Chancellor , has not yet completed his Cabinet . General von Liittwitz will be Minister of Military Defense , Herr Schiffer Minister of Justice , Herr Bang Minister of Finance , Herr Schifle Minister of National Economy , and Dr. Traub minister of Education . It is thought probable that Gottlieb von Jagow will become Minister of the Interior for Prussia . Rumors have been In circulation during the day that members of the old Government have been arrested in Dresden , but at the moment of telegraphing no confirmation is to hand regarding such reports . In official quarters they are regarded as untrue , and it is declared that the whereabouts of the Ministers who fled is unknown . Another report has it that . Herr Fehrenbach , Preside-nt of the National Assembly , which the new regime has dissolved , has called upon that body to meet at Stuttgart . There is not a great deal of news from the country in general . strikes are reported from the Ruhr region , Frankfort , Hamburg , Breslau and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other parts of Germany . No Papers Till Monday Afternoon . I learn definitely That no nmvspapers will be allowed to appear till Monday afternoon . In circles closely connected with the new regime I have been informed that the first parleys between General von Ltittwitz and the old regime concerned Liittwitz 's demand for the appointment of General Hoffmann as commander in Berlin . The reason for that demand was the fear entertained concerning the Ebert Government 's negotiating with Moscow . The representative of the old Government refused to agree to this request , and thereupon those w ho have now assumed power made up their minds that the time had come to act . In the same circles it is insisted that the new Government will carry ( nit the terms of the Peace Treaty to the utmost of its powers , and is ready to act in all matters of European concern where joint action is advisable and necessary . Especially does the new regime think a united front is demanded against Bolshevist influences in the nrosent state of Europe .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
