Last week , three months after it met , the 70th Congress had the aspect of a thoroughly political Congress , which is what any truly professional Congress is expected to be in a presidential year . Its routine work was pretty well out of the way , but matters of intimate consequence to citizens , and therefore of private anxiety to Congressmen , were in a state of turmoil which portended a legislative jam when it comes time for the Congress to adjourn in June . <P> Work Done . The first thing the 70th Congress did in December was to make amends for things left undone in the filibustering 69th Congress , by passing a Deficiency Bill of appropriations to pay the back bills of assorted Government branches . Also , the House shoved along to the Senate with dutiful promptitude , appropriation bills to run the Government until July 1 , 1929 . By last week all but two of the ten Departments , and most of the independent bureaus , had been provided for . The two Departments yet to be provided for were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $143,000,000 ) were voted by the House . <P> The one other large piece of legislation passed by both houses was the Alien Property Bill , to return or pay for seizures made eleven years ago . This measure carried riders increasing various clerical salaries , which irked President Coolidge , but not seriously enough to invite a veto . It was signed last week . <P> For the fourth time in five years , the Senate passed Senator Norris 's common-sensical resolution to amend the Constitution so that Congress , including newly-elected members , would meet on a set date ( Jan. 2 ) each year and remain seated until its business is finished , instead of making new Congressmen wait 13 months to be seated and adjourning on March 4 every other year , as now ; also , so that the President would take office Jan. 15 instead of March 4 . Last week the House hemmed and hawed as usual over this attack on " lame duck " sessions and modified Senator Norris 's resolution beyond recognition . Then , as usual , it voted down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Representative La Guardia of New York promptly filed a bill to abolish " lame duckery " without amending the Constitution . <P> Both houses passed , and President Coolidge signed , a measure providing some 100 millions for new Federal buildings here and there throughout the land . For buildings in the District of Columbia , funds were authorized in a separate bill . <P> Work Half-Done . Outstanding upon the 70th Congress 's list of good intentions when it met were eight measures , varying from a flood control outlay to radio legislation . Of these eight intentions , four had been debated , three passed by one or other of the houses and five not yet acted upon by either house , up to last week . The half-done work was as follows :
