AFTER two years in France with the Bed Cross , I went home in the autumn of 1919 , determined to get back to normal ' and settle down . But I soon discovered that normal is a synonym for dull , and I just could n't make myself settle . One morning after I had been normal for about a month , I received a note from Miss Andress : ' Will you go to Tiflis with me in two weeks ? ' I would , yes ; and we sailed on November 21 , my sister and I. We were assigned to duty at Delijan in the Caucasus , where we passed abusy and not uninteresting winter , in charge of six orphan asylums . On the first of April , we received orders to move on to Kars , where I was appointed Director of Education and Agricul ture . I was just getting things started ? the fields ploughed and the five thousand children separated into classes ? when , on May 2 , we suddenly received orders to evacuate the Caucasus . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S.S. Pittsburgh , ? fifty-six women on a battleship ! ? we arrived at Constantinople , and were quartered on one of the islands . The first week in June , 1920 , came a wireless from Colonel Haskell , asking for fifteen women to he sent to Batoum , as things had quieted down . We traveled up the Black Sea from Constantinople on a 1500-ton cargo boat , and were greeted by the news that we were to turn right round and go back again , as the British were really evacuating the port this time , and under the circumstances it was decided not to send women into the interior . Fortunately for my sister and me , they were shorthanded at headquarters , and we were asked to stay and help out . I went to work as a typist , while my sister took charge of the officers ' mess . The military control of relief in the Caucasus ended on July 1 , and Colonel Haskell turned the organization over to Mr. Yarrow . My sister and I volunteered to go in under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of July found us in Kars , the first American women back in the field . It was worth waiting for . Spring had transfigured Kars . It had rained every day during May and most of June , and when we arrived , the hills were ablaze with flowers ; I have never dreamed of anything like them outside of a florist 's window . And then , besides , there were lots of funny little bright-colored birds , and skylarks singing high up against the sapphire sky . Kars was one of the strongest fortresses on the old Russian frontier . It is ringed round with forts of modern construction , sonic dating only from 1914 . The modern town was built by the military , and must have been quite imposing . The Armenians partly destroyed it in their retreat before the Turks in 1017 , when the Russian Army turned Bolshevist ; and there is little left except the wide , well-paved streets and a few smoke-grimed fa ? ades to show what the town once was . The garrison during the Russian regime numbered thirty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the citvend in the valley where our personnel house was situated . The committee was caring for six thousand children in these buildings when I went back to Kars . Mr. Fox , the District Commander , had worked tirelessly after our withdrawal in May , and had not only kept the organization in fine order , but had made many improvements . There were seven orphanages and six hospitals to look after ; my sister was assigned to the orphanages , and I went into the hospital department . I once took the Red Cross course in Home Care of the Sick , ' but there Was nothing in it about how to be a hospital superintendent . I also worked in a New York hospital for three week , and learned how to clean bed-tables very thoroughly . In France I was assigned to duty in evacuation hospitals , served through three big drives , and grew very proficient in washing feet . But I had never run a hospital . In Kars I roan . aged seven , and was responsible for about eighteen hundred patients . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death-rate did not increase . In the Caucasus a ' sister ' is is very superior thing . All you have to clo become one is to wear a white headdress and talk about prestige . Prestige means that you ca n't make beds or open a window or bathe a patient ; and eight duty is unheard of , for it gives you wrinkles and interferes with your social engagements . Iliad sixty sisters on ley staff , and only three of them knew how to give a hypodermic . One of the first things I did was to establish a nurses ' training-school ? and I almost started a revolution at the same time because I insisted that the pupils should learn to scrub floors and make soup before they were allowed to dress wounds and give medicines . Prestige and closed windows were my ! palest worries . But they were not Llae only ones . Every morning my desk would be elbow-deep in notes . The Armenian loves above everything to write letters , and will do so on the slightest provocation . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his problems were very vexing ; for instance : ? To MISS BETTY ANDERSON , Hospital Manager . It is stated by the housekeeper of the hospital No. 1 that the pigs of the hospital do not receive food and they do not obey to the pig keeper . She prays therefore , to have ordered an arrangements about that pigs , who never want to obey , without food , to the pig keeper , please . And then , no sooner was the pig question solved , than I received the following : ? To Miss B. ANDERSON . To-day no drop of water too . No baril coming no pipes giving . Please have done your insinuations about . I was on my horse from morning to night , making my rounds . In about six weeks an American doctor arrived and took some of my cares , but I still had enough left to keep me amused . The District Commander and my sister struggled tirelessly with the orphanages . Mr. Fox decided that something must be done to make the listless , morbid children more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun , and rouse themselves only to eat . So he designed merry-go-rounds , swings , and see-saws ; and for weeks went to the orphanage and demonstrated the broad jump , high jump , quoits , and blindman 's buff . The children loved to watch him and would mechanically do as they were told ; but immediately afterward would sink back into their lethargy . The teachers were ordered to make the boys play ; and so each in turn was forced to swing or see-saw or something , for five minutes at a time . They looked so thoroughly miserable , and play seemed so utterly distasteful to them , that at last the playground was admitted a failure . My nurses , however , loved the swings , and whenever I missed one on the wards , I would know just where to find her . My contract with the N.E.R . expired on September 30 , and I planned to leave at once , with my sister and Mr. Fox . Toward the middle of the summer , three girls and a man arrived to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as our contract s were up . It was just about this time that the wood-problem became serious . Kars District is barren of forests , and all our fuel was brought by rail from Sambamish . During the summer months there had been constant fighting between the Armenians and the Kemalist s . The Armenians were confident of pushing on to Erzerum , and bad mobilized every man of fighting age ( incidentally leaving the harvest to take care of itself ) . The British had sent equipment , arms , and ammunition for an army of forty thousand men , and prospects seemed bright . And then , suddenly , on Sep-bomber es , the Turks captured Sarakamish , an important strategical stronghold on the Armenian frontier , about sixty versts from Kars . We had heard rumors that things were not going well , but at that time we looked upon the ' war ' as something rather amusing , and not likely to affect us at Kars . With the capture of Sarakamish , however , things began to look serious : our wood-supply was cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages , and the people of Kars were panic-stricken . On the night of September 30 , the Kemalists advanced again and entered the village of Begliahmed , about fifteen versts from Kars . At a meeting in town late that night it was decided to evacuate the women and children . Up to that time no one had been allowed to leave the city , because it was thought that it would have a bad effect on the morale of the troops . A panic started , and at one o'clock in the morning a message was sent to us at the personnel house saying that the situation in town was bad . Up to this time we had all been sleeping at home . Mr. Fox made late nightly rounds of all the institutions , and it did not seem necessary to change our usual routine . He had assigned a post to each of us in case of trouble ; and on the morning of the panic we were aroused from our peaceful sleep , and having swallowed a hasty cup of coffee , scattered to our various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark to make the tour of my six hospitals . The two in the valley were quiet , although the personnel besieged me with questions and begged for advice to stay or go . We could not assure protection , of course , as we had no idea . what attitude the Turks would take toward the Committee ; but Mr. Fox promised to do all he could for our native employees and their families . When I reached the outskirts of town , swarms of my hospital personnel met me and clung to my stirrups , the horse 's tail , my hands , sobbing , kissing my feet , begging to be saved . I could only urge them to be calm , and beg some of them to go back to the hospitals , where they had left the sick children entirely alone . With daylight came a return of confidence . The authorities decided to let no more civilians leave the city ; report hail it that the Turks were not advancing beyond Novo Salem , about eighteen miles away , and the morale improved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , I did n't sleep , because there were fleas , ? and the fact of my presence seemed to relieve everybody 's mind . If they had known how extremely small I felt , and how seared I was , I do n't lie . lieve they would have been so coo However , nothing bothered me the fleas . Kars , after the II capture of Sitrakamish , was overrun by the Mauserists , or Volunteers , a semi-military organization under a leader named Saha . These Mauserists ( so-called because of the gun they carry ) were not paid by the government , but grew rich from Ihr loot they gathered when they follin ed on the heels of the regular soldiers . In all they numbered about fifteen 16u-sand , and they were a law unto Otani-selves . Without hesitation they would take supplies from our wagons , and exchange a tired horse for a fresh one out of one of the Russian teams . The Ressians belonged to a religious sect called Molikan , similar to the Mennonites of Pennsylvania , and believed in non-resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let- the Armenians do as they pleased . So an American had toga with every convoy of wagons , to protect the food intended for Armenian children from the Armenians themselves . A nurse now arrived to relieve me or my duties in the hospitals , and my days were spent in the saddle , escorting hay-and wood-wagons . It was a pleasant task in the beautiful autumn went her . We would go perhaps fifteen versts . and I would lunch in some hospitable Russian kitchen while the wagons were loading , and then start for home about dusk , always with the prospect of at least a verbal battle on the way . On these trips I was within sound of the guns , and could see the Turkish posts on the heights overlooking the plain . The lurks held the same line for several weeks . The town gradually quieted down , and nobody was allowed to leave . Hundreds of cattle , which the Armenian , had captured from the Kurds during the summer , grazed on the plains outside the town , and encampments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Armenians were to make a big attack . Everyone knew about it beforehand , and it was the one topic of conversation . For some reason the drive failed , and the Armenians fell back to new positions . The reason given me for the failure of the drive was that the new British rifles had been issued only the day before , and the soldiers had never fired them ; but I am not sure that this is true . It was shortly after this that Mr. Fox , ridding to my request to ' see the front , ' took three of us out to visit Colonel Miramanoff in his dugout . He had been there only two days before ; but when we reached the place , we found the camp deserted , and drove on to discover headquarters . We thought that the Armenians must have made a successful drive , for we went on without seeing a living soul . Begliahmed , which is just a straggling settlement of mud-houses , was deserted , and we drove on to Novo Salem . Here Mr. Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied that Russian village several weeks . He stopped the car and sent the Russian chauffeur ahead for news . We waited on the hill overlooking the village . It was a peaceful scene : the red-roofed houses , each with its stork nest , clustered beside the winding river , neat fields rising to the snow-capped mountains beyond . It was Sunday , and the Molikans , dressed in the brilliant colors they so adore , were strolling about , or standing to gossip in groups . The moment they caught sight of thecar , the groups scattered , and even the children ducked into the houses , so that . presently- there was not a soul to be seen . George hurried back , breathless . ' Turks here ! ' he gasped in Russian , and there ? there ? are Turkish batteries ! ' While he was speaking Mr. Fox swung the car around and jammed his foot down on the accelerator . He drove an ambulance in France , but I am sure that , even with whiz-bangs sailing 0 V or-head , he never went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were crawling at fifteen miles an hour , but he says we were making fifty . For fully five miles we were in sight of the Turkish batteries , and could see the men watching us . We hardly breathed until at last we reached a small group of Armenian soldiers on the other side of Begliahmed . This was the outpost of the Armenian army , but it had never occurred to them to stop us ? in fact , I remember they had stood at attention and saluted Mr. Fox when we passed . One of our party , stroking dawn his hair , which had stood on end during our dash to safety , was heard to murmur , This is a hell of a front ! ' On the night of the twenty-eighth the Turks cut the railroad to Alexandropol . This was the most serious thing that had yet happened , for it broke our communication with the outside world ; and it looked as if we were in for a long siege . At that time we had only about a month 's food-supply for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was convoying wagons of milk and flour to the city hospitals . Winter had set in , with sleet and snow , and the convoy business was no longer a pleasure excursion . Town seemed as usual ; the guns were not firing so often , I thought . At eleven o'clock I had just delivered ten loads and was starting back to the 700 HUNTING TROD warehouse , when hell suddenly broke loose in the city . People poured from the houses ; the streets became jammed with ox-carts , horses , soldiers , dogs , babies , sheep , and animals of every description , with bedding hastily strapped on their backs . A pandemonium of excitement , which reminded me of the great movie scene in the Last Days of Pompeii . Turk egaee ! ' screamed the people ; the Turks are coming ! ' Panic-stricken , the throng milled like frightened cattle . My Russian teamsters , stolid and dependable , looked to me for orders . I pointed to the warehouse and spurred my fidgeting horse through the crowd . We did not go far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and I saw the loaded wagons coming from the warehouse . Mr. White rode at the rear and asked me to take the head of the column . As we passed the hospital gate , my sister ran out . ' They say the Turks are in the city , Betty ; I 'll stay here ? take care of yourself ! ' There was time for only a hurried hand-clasp , and I rode on . I shall never understand how we succeeded in keeping those forty wagons together in the jam . I kept hitting soldiers off the fourgons , already overloaded with rice , flour , and milk . Mothers tried to force their babies into my arms ; sheep 's horns got caught in my stirrups ; my horse shied at a camel and almost climbed into an ox-cart ; but still we moved on , caught in that panicky jam of humanity . It was each one for himself in that flight . I saw soldiers , with tears of terror streaming down their cheeks , push women and children aside , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank , fear-stricken look that I can never forget . The moans and sobs of thousands mingled with the rattle of the ox-carts , the hafting of the BLE IN ARMENIA sheep , and the lowing of the countless cattle . As we left town and entered the val . ley , a new sound came to my ears : the crackle of rifle and machine-gun fire . The valley is narrow ? you would call it a canon at home . The swift Earschi flows through it , with a road on either bank , and the sides of the gorge rise abruptly about eight or nine hundred feet , and are crowned by the fortifications . Steep flights of stone steps scale the precipice . I saw Armenian cavalry leading their horses down those steps at a run , while the infantry poured down the zig-zag cattle-paths , throwing their rifles away as they ran . Just across the river I saw two officers try to stop the rout . They dismounted , drew their horses across the road , and shouted at the oncoming mob . Still it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank ; two men fell , but the rest swept on and I could not see what became of the officers . The rattle of fire was continuous , and I could see men on the crest of the hill silhouetted against the sky . I new know these were Turkish soldiers , who had captured the fort and were firing on the fleeing enemy ; but at the time I thought they were Armenians . At the personnel house the supply officer took charge of my wagons , and I galloped on to Hospital No. 2 , whore I found things in a terrible mess . It was the first American building in the path of the refugees and soldiers , and they were pouring into it through the doors and windows they had broken . From my horse I banged down with my gas-pipe on the heads below me . I screamed in Armenian that this was a children 's hospital and that soldiers must not take refuge there ; but with blood trickling from their broken heads , they swarmed in , and I saw that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the children out and up to Hospital No. 1 , on the hill . They were 001 bed-patients , but were all suffering from ferns , the scalp-disease . Mr. White rode on to make a place for them , while I tried to gather them toget her . I had a terrible time getting into the building . To get upstairs I had to climb user the heads and shoulders of the people crowded there . The nurses had tried to keep the wards clear ; but the crowd had got entirely beyond their control , and the people were swarming in , onto the beds , under the beds , every , here . My four hundred kiddies were lost in the mob and greeted me with shrieks of joy , I gathered up the babies and gave them to the bigger girls to carry , then began to strip blankets and sheets from the beds , intending to lock them in the storeroom . The nurses , of course , were hysterical , and the Armenian doctor was wringing his hands . Suddenly a new sound was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullets breaking glass . One , two , three whizzed in , I knew it would be madness to attempt to move the children under rifle-fire , so I told them to lie flat on the floor , while I hurried down to the door . Everything was silent in the building now ; the people had stopped their moaning and had sunk into dumb terror . The crowd outside the door had melted as if by magic . From the height across the river came the rhythmic tat-tat-tat of a machine-gun , and I drew back as a bullet whistled uncomfortably close to my ear . The Armenian doctor was literally ! wring his hair . They are coming ! ' he moaned . ' Soon they will be here ! What shall I do ? ' Two small rooms used for officers opened off the entrance-hall . The door was locked . A big Armenian soldier stood cowering before it . ' Break open that door , ' I ordered . Then I told the doctor to collect all the nurses and older girls and bring them to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the butt of a rifle , but I never thOught that I should take such a keen personal interest in the proceeding . It seemed to take an hour . The big soldier was so frightened that he had no strength ; so at last one of the big orphans seized the gun and crashed in a panel . The first person inside the door was that big soldier . Get out ! This room is for the women , ' I told hint . He started to crawl under the sofa , but I pointed my revolver at hint and he crawled out of the door instead , muttering somet ling uncomplimentary about American women in general and me in particular . As I look back on it now , I am horrified to realize that I came very near shooting that creature . The doctor brought in about thirty women , and I herded them into the back room , where they crouched , almost insensible front fright . Hardly had I got them settled , when a boy dashed in to tell me that there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get out of the door , so jumped out of the window and ran round to the back of the house . There I found about a hundred soldiers . Some of them were wounded , and a dying horse was making the most horrible sounds . In Armenian , I shouted to these men that they were endangering their own children by hiding there ; but they only stared at me stupidly , and one man , sick with fright , vomited . The bullets were too thick to let me run round the front of the house again ? I could hear Glens spatting against the wall . So I crawled through a back window and fought my way to the office , where I could at least breathe . The people whined and kissed my feet ' 102 HUNTING TROUBLE IN ARMENIA as I passed . Some of the soldiers were taking off their British uniforms and putting on rags I he refugees gave them . I was seized with a revulsion of feeling ? a disgust for the whole cowardly lot of them . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched creatures . I guess I was pretty badly scared , and I believe I Would have run away had it been possible . Fortunately I did n't have any more time to think about myself . Several holly wounded children were brought to me , and I was kept busy . One little girl had been shot through the abdomen by a due-due , and her intestines were protruding . There were no bandages available , so I pulled down the window-curtains , tore them up , and st tared them into the wound . I made t he child as comfortable as I could with a blanket and pillow , but I knew it was only a question of minutes with her . I had just finished binding up the other wounds when Mr. White appeared . The firing has stopped , ' he said , ' Doctor Surian , up at Hospital 1 , is badly wounded ; send your doctor there right away . ' Karakashian at first refused to go ; but after two or three minutes , when he found that the firing did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. White said that he thought things must be going pretty well , and that the Armenians had repulsed the Turks ; but the words were not out of his mouth before Egtrakashian dashed back . " rile Turks are here ? at the door ! ' he gasped . ' Sit down on the flood ' The refugees were perfectly quiet ? you could have heard a pin drop . All I can remember is the husky breathing of the dying child at my feet . I looked out of the window , and on the crest of the la opposite I saw a column of men marching as if on parade . At the head of the column was a red flag bearing the star and crescent . I have never felt so alone , so en irch helpless , and so thoroughly frightened . I picked up the American flag from the floor where the doctor had dropped it , and stepped to the door . It was a little home-made flag , with just ten stars an it , but to me it felt like armor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cautiously , about on a level with my stomach . Behind it appeared a face ? drawn , sweaty , eager , mean . American ! ' I quavered ; trying to say it with a Turkish accent , and holding out my flag . Up went the bayonet . and off went the gun right over my head . It made a terrible explosion in the narrow little entry . I staggered against t door-frame and said , ' American , ' again , rather feebly . I think the Turk smiled . IIe lowered his bayonet and backed me into the room , Five or six more soldiers entered and went on into the building . My Turk , I now took time to see , was about six feet tall , and fair-haired . After looking us over he patted me on the shoulder , told me to stay where I was , and it ft me . Two other soldiers came in and ordered Karakashian and Mr. White into the hall . One of them snatched at my wrist-watch , bracelet , and ring ; t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next he tugged at my riding-breeches , pointed to his own rags , and told me to take mine off . I shook Inc head determinedly , but he tugged all the harder . They are too small for you and I wo n't take them off ! ' I said in English , which of course he could not understand . We argued for several minutes , ? he in Turkish and I in English . ? growing more desperate every moment . ' I wo n't , wo n't , wo n't ! ' I protested . Then he laughed , and mimicked me : ' We , wo , wo ! ' I knew I had won , and sent him off happy by geneously presenting him with somebody else 's raincoat . just then Mr. White came back . At first I did not recognize him , for the ' lurks had stripped him , leaving him barefoot in his B.V.D. 's . Karakashian followed , clad only in a linen shirt reaching to his knees . They looked so utterly miserable and so entirely absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks . As soon as I could stop laughing I handed them each a blanket , which they draped around themselves like togas . They did n't think it was at all funny . A sergeant came in . Something prompted me to address him in French , and he answered courteously in the same tongue . He had heard of America , but did not know there were any Americans in Kars . He said that he was going to march all the refugees down to his officer on the bridge , and that we must come too . I begged to be allowed to stay with the children ; but he refused . He stooped to stroke the head of one of the wounded kiddies on the floor , and said it was too bad they had to suffer . The nurses had by this time passed from voiceless to vocal terror , and he stepped to the door , spoke kindly to them , and told them they had nothing to fear . Still they howled , and he turned to me with an expressive gesture of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While this was going on , terrible shrieks were coming from the floor above . Presently the sergeant went up and the noise stopped . Two men in the doorway had either refused , or had been too terrified , to move as the Turks ordered , and they had been bayoneted . As for as I could discover , those two men , one other , accidentally shot , and the little girl , were the only deaths in my hospital , and I do not know per sonally of one case of deliberate murder , either then or later . The order was given to clear the building , leaving only the children . While they were getting the soldiers out , from under the beds , I had a chat with the soldier who had almost bayoneted me . We smoked a cigarette together , and conversed in Russian . He knew twelve words and I know eleven , but we got on famously , and he seemed like any one of the thousands of Tommies and Poilus and Yanks with whom I had chatted in France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . I led the procession ( very thankful for my riding-breeches ) , with my American flag on my arm . Mr. White and Karakashian , solemn , and stepping tenderly over the sharp stones , were followed by the grinning sergeant , and the two thousand or more refugees and soldiers shuffled after . The road was well-nigh impassable . We had to pick our way over dead people and dying animals , and climb over ox-carts , household effects , sacks of flour , bedding , sheep , chickens , cats . All the worldly possessions of the miserable refugees were there , and already the Turkish soldiers were picking over the loot . On the bridge we found a crowd of other refugees who had been rounded up in the valley . A smart young Turk ish officer , with turned-up black mustaches and snappy black eyes , was standing under a white flag . We went up to him , and through an interpret er told him we were Americans . He was polite but uninterested , and told us to stay with the crowd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came onto the bridge , but none of the personnel from our other institutions , 704 HUNTING TROUBLE IN ARMENIA and no other Americans . Our Russian teamsters were standing on the parapet , and their huge bodies rocked with titantic laughter when they saw Mr. White 's costume . We were jammed in like sardines . The people had begun to moan again ? a low wail , impossible to describe , and once heard never to be forgotten . Directly behind me was an Armenian soldier with tears streaming down his cheeks . Between sobs he told me that he had been to Los Angeles , that God was good and was waiting for us , and that it would n't be long now . A woman sidled up to me and thrust a bit of jewelry into my pocket ; she said she did n't want the Turks to get it when they killed her . All the unfortunate creatures seemed absolutely sure that they were going to be massacred , in spite of the kindly attitude of the soldiers and the patient officer . We stood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at last , I caught sight of Mr. Clark and a Mohican on horseback on the road above . I waved my flag until my arm was stiff , and finally they saw me and turned their horses down the path . Fred , the Molikan , has been in America . He is over six feet tall , with an engaging smile and a fine sense of humor . We had grown to be good friends during the weeks that I had convoyed his wagons . I went to meet him and took hold of his great horny fist . ' Fred , get me out of this ! ' Sure I 'm going to get you out , ' he grinned . ' What is this keeping you here for , anyhow ? ' He put the question more politely to the officer , and added that the Pasha would be very angry if he learned that I had been held as a prisoner with the refugees . The officer 's manner changed . He said that Mr. White , Karakashian , ? whom we passed off as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personnel house under guard , if we would promise to remain there until further orders . I asked what was going to be done with the other prisoners , and he said that , with the exception of the soldiers , they would all be released when they reached town . When I started to leave the bridge , the whole mob tried to follow me . I suppose the heroic thing for me to do was to stay with them ; but by this time I had had about all I could stand ? my one idea was to get away from the sound and smell of them . The house was in terrible disorder . Fortunately Mrs. White had locked my room , and nothing was missing . I was beyond caring for such unimportant things at the moment , however , for I could think of nothing but my sister , and what had happened to her . We had always thought that in case of trouble the city would be the most dangerous place ; and knowing what I had been through , I feared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in the house only a few minutes when I heard the purr of the Dodge coming up the hill , and rushed out to meet it . There was a large Red Crescent flag fluttering from the windshield , and Mr. Fox chatting with a distinguished-looking Turkish officer on the back seat . I have never been so glad to see anybody . Of course , the first thing I asked was , ' How is Frances ? ' Perfectly all right ? no trouble in town . What happened here ? ' We had tea while we were telling our stories , and afterward Mr. Fox started off to find the Pasha . The officer asked us not to leave the house again that night , and advised me to make armbands bearing the red crescent for all the Americans . Little by little I pieced together the story of the capture of Kars . The Turks had advanced across the plain in open formation , and had met with no resistance . Not one of the big guns of the inner forts had fired a shot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Armenians ran out the other . The Kemalists captured an enormous amount of booty in Kars . Besides the big guns and great stores of ammunition , there were three hundred new machine-guns recently received from the British , and never taken from the packing cases . I was told that a few of these guns , well placed , could have held the fort for days , as the Turks had to advance without cover over a line system of trenches , barbed wire , and moats , to approach the strongholds themselves . Many British rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition were also taken , in addition to food , clothing , and equipment of all kinds . I was told that the Armenian army in Ears District numbered about fifteen thousand , and the Kemalists seven thousand ; but I can not vouch for the accuracy of these figures . Kazim Karabekir Pasha , the commander of the Turks , made a tour of our institutions the day after the occupation of the city . He was much interested in our system and organization , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had nothing to fear . He asked Mr. Fox to continue with the work as before , and promised every protection and assistance within his power . After the inspection he came to the house to tea , with his aide , and Rushti Bey , who was to be the Military Governor of Kars . The Pasha is a man of stocky build and of medium height . He has a firm chin , a dark mustache curled upward , a straight nose , and unusually kind and humorous brown eyes . He wore a trig gray uniform and overcoat , with no decorations or insignia , spoke excellent French without a trace of foreign accent , and had charming manners . He apologized for the soldier who had taken my watch and bracelet , and promised to try and get them back for me . He also congratulated me on having kept my breeches ? by this time the story had got around , and I was known as the girl who kept her trousers . ' If there had been five American women stationed on the forts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers would not be in Kars to-day . ' Turks are delightful . Early in the morning the day after the battle , I plastered myself with red crescents and started out to see what was going on . Hospital No. 2 was the most terrible-looking place I had ever imagined . The Turks had ripped open every mattress and quilt , and one waded knee-sleep in feathers . There was a lot of blood everywhere , and the two bayoneted men at the limit of the stairs had messed things up frightfully . The building reeked of refugees and rubbish ? every blanket and sheet had been stolen , and all the food-supplies . The only things I found were five miserable babies sobbing among the feathers , and a sixth half-drowned in a wash-tub . I gathered these up and went on to Hospital No. 1 . I had also to keep my eye on the three valley orphanages . There were constant alarms , and I would rush out , expecting to find that all the girls were being kidnaped by the terrible Turks . I usually discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a better pair on an Armenian . I would lead him through the orphanage , and if he 8:1W anything that he fancied on our personnel , I would superintend the exchange , give him a cigarette , and send him off happy . They were always most courteous to me and amiable . During the day a guard was posted at all our institutions . These were not regular Kemalist soldiers , but Kurdish volunteers . They were ragged , untrained villagers , but thoroughly good-natured , and obeyed absolutely the orders given by their officer . I found my two guards squinting down the barrels of their rifles with great interest , and wondering how the thing went off . I showed them all I knew and they were very grateful , explaining ( all this in pantomime ) that they relied on their wicked-looking knives when it came to a pinch . All of our personnel and orphans were in such a panic , that for days we could do nothing with them . I got Hospital No. 2 cleaned , and the children back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lungs . The worst of all was burying the bodies . Armenians are superstitious about corpses , and will not touch them . To move the bodies , I had to tic rope around t hem myself , and then order the men to drag them out and dump them into the grave . For a week after the battle I was constantly discovering wounded people who had crawled into secluded corners to hide . It was interesting that invariably these cases were reported to me by Turkish soldiers , who would go out of their way to come and tell me about some woman or child they had found who should be taken to the hospital . This was pure kindliness on their part , for , had they cut the throats of those unfortunates , no one would have been the wiser . The Turks quickly restored order in the town . As is the custom in that part of the work ! , the conquering army was allowed three days ' looting . After that , all offenses were severely punished , and strict martial law was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-six were deported to Sarakas mish , to work on the railroad and in the lumber-camps . None of the employees of the Near-East Relief were taken , however , and they were allowed every freedom . Our warehouses were sealed , and to get into them we had to ask the permission of the governor . One al . cer in the quartermaster 's department broke into the medical storehouse and helped himself . When this was tliscov. ered , the officer was removed and every apology offered . The Turks seemed well supplied kith everything . Some of the soldiers were ragged , but for the most part they were warmly clad . One of the crack regi. ments wore American uniforms ; I saw lots of S.O.S. insignia , and some Sec. and Army ? wound-stripes , service . stripes and all ! These uniforms had originally been bought by the British , and sent by I hen , to Denikin 's army , from whom they were captured by the Bolsheviki , nho sent them to the Kemalists ! The American personnel were given military passes written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /xis , said : ' This is the little Miss Anderson : do not touch her , and allow her to pass freely in Kars . ' But we were prisoners just the same . Mr. Fox 's request that he be permitted to go to Alexandropol was politely denied . Turks never say no flatly , but tell you that perhaps day after to-mor. row it will be possible . When day after to-morrow conies they say , ' In ton days , ' and so on . During the year I had been in the Caucasus very few Armenians had called at our house , and I had never been invited to their homes except to formal official banquets . But with the Turks it was different . The officers loved to come to the house ; and although it was a two-mile walk from the town , they would often come out in the evening , to it by our fire , make Turkish coffee . and talk . They were all men of cultivation ; most of them spoke French well , ; old had been educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cut off from the world . Jellaladin Arif Bey , the President of t he Kinnalist Parliament , was one of our guests , and Nuri Pasha , the half-brother of the famous Enver Pasha , another . Arif Bey weighs about three hundred pounds , loves to dance , and never tires of talking about Paris . Nuri is a man of thirty , a dreamer and an idealist . Ile is a clever artist , and hopes that sonic day he may go back to Vienna study . : 111 the officers spoke enthusiastically about General Harbord , referring to him always as ' His Excellency . ' They are eager for American friendship , saying that see are the only nation who Call disinterestedly help them . They want American industries and American trade . One and all they hate the English . We had been led to believe that the object of the Turkish advance was to join the Bolsheviki ; but the Turks never confirmed this . They joked among themselves about Bolshevism , discussed its advantages and disadvantages , and even expressed the opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed that all these men were plentifully supplied with Russian gold , and I wondered how they had got it . The situation among the refugees in town was desperate . Two thousand women and children and old men were housed in one of t he buildings that we had once used as an orphanage . For t he first few weeks these people lived on the wheat and barley they had brought from their villages ; but soon this supply ran low . Toward t he end of October they began to starve , and were eating the putrid flesh of the cows and horses that had been killed during the battle three weeks before . The Turks realized the danger of an epidemic , and they were planning to send the people back to the villages , Where food , t hough not . plentiful , was not altogether lacking . They were taking a count of the refugees and planning to issue a bread ration . On December 1 we Were at last given permission to leave Kars for Alexandropol . The chief of staff gave us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Clark , my sister , and I made up our party , and we were a very cheerful foursome . We were leaving plenty of Americans to swing the job , the Turks were giving every assistance , and the institutions were running as usual . At Constantinople they wanted to make heroes of us , but we preferred to hurry on and hide our light under the shadow of Eiffel Tower . Somewhere between Constantinople and Paris I was robbed for the last time ( I hope ! ) , and lost two handsome gold goblets that had been given me by the Armenian doctor who thought I had saved his life . Nothing is left me but my famous riding-breeches !
