A sharp rattle of handclaps and a booming salute of " hoch ! hoch ! HOCH ! " greeted Prince August Wilhelm , fourth son of Wilhelm II , last week , when he entered a Berlin auditorium into which 5,000 rabid Monarchists had jammed with intent to demonstrate . <P> <P> Soon fiery Count Kuno von Westarp , leader of the second largest political party in the land , Die Deutschnationale Volkspartei introduced a still more rabid Monarchist , Col. von Struense , who proceeded to utter things which Count von Westarp , because of his political status , dare not say . Bristling and bellicose , Col. von Struense roared : " A turning point in German history has arrived-this evening marks the beginning of a fight which can end only in the coronation of a German Kaiser ! " <P> That was about all , except that Prince August Wilhelm and Count Kuno von Westarp and the Colonel went on later in the evening to several more Monarchist rallies , with a total attendance estimated around 15,000 . <P> At each rally Col. von Struense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained that Monarchists should busy themselves with drumming up 20,000,000 votes , the legal number required to make effective a referendum on the question of whether Germany shall remain a Republic or revert to the status of Empire . <P> Count Kuno von Westarp is certainly too shrewd to imagine that the 20,000,000 votes will ever be polled ; but he needs an issue around which to rally supporters to his Party , and apparently he has decided that by backing the " Kaiser Referendum " he can win the support of the few thousand super-Monarchist revolutionaries who have heretofore kept up their own party organizations . <P> Ineffectual Prince August Wilhelm is just now the freak in Count von Westarp 's Monarchist side show . His plump , effectual onetime spouse , Princess Alexandra Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein , divorced him in 1920 . Their son , Prince Ferdinand , just about to turn swart 16 , already drills with a Monarchist " Youth Corps. "
