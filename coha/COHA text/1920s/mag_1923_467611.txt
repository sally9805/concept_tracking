This is the first of a series of remarkable experiences of a woman school-teacher in the sparsely settled districts of the West . In these " far places " ? remote from town and railroad ? a rugged and picturesque life is being lived to-day by tittle polyglot communities of immigrants . For ten years Miss Zerr has here found the role of school-teacher an extraordinary adventure , and her graphic chronicle is a moving and intensely human story. ? THE EDIT0118 . I AM a close relative of the town 1 drunkard . The town drunkard and I are a scandal to our friends and family , who love to lift us up out of the gutter and plead with us to live better and worthier lives , asking us why we insist on wasting our talents and strength in ignoble pursuits when , with a little will power , we could easily be rich and successful and a credit to our folks . I do not deny that I am clever , probably even cleverer than the town drunkard ; and when my old friends meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then spring the reproaches , I have nothing to say . I admit that ! should be doing something with my talents : here is a world going to the dogs , with business at a standstill , and political problems puzzling the best minds , and yet I roam at large , with no responsibility and no worry . It is not right , and sometimes remorse seizes me and I toss on my pillow and moan , " My misspent life ! My misspent lifer " like the drunken hero of the ancient melodrama . Can I help it ? To please my friends I go to work regularly every June , and for a month or so my employers flatter me and tell me what a great future I have in the blessed realm of sight drafts and bills of lading . Then I needs must tire of the commonplaceness of regular folks and the dreariness of regular occupation , and I take to gazing at the pink and purple sections of a map , which represent such untold adventures and unsung lives ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and finding I am still a recognized though by no means glittering member of the despised profession , I soar joyfully to some level at five thousand feet up in the snow , and am at home in a foreign land . I take no stand politically on the question of immigration , but as an authority on the foreigners in the barren places of this foreign land of ours , I do stand ( modestly ) alone . And of all foreign parts , 1 know of none foreigner than the waste lands of my country . In ten years of moving onward I 've never lived in an American community . We of the cultured set ( " book artists " in popular parlance ) do n't expect to . When we " receive a call , " we hunt up a sister-sufferer and ask , " What are the people ? " The answer comes in terms of nationalities : " Swedes , Austrians , or Wops , " as the case may be . One becomes a globe trotter . In the confines of a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of great capitals , to be sure , but the deep-cut , age-haunted , mysterious life of European peasantry . How can one , then , after having held the black-eyed baby of Italy , swathed from shoulders to feet like a Raphael bambino , and having learned to lisp languorous syllables from an angel-faced Madonna ? how can such a one be contented to put in a lifetime in the composition of such airy persiflage as " Yours of the twentyninth received and in reply would state ? " which is considered a proper occupation for a young woman of undoubted ability and energy ? I can not make my friends understand this , however , and yet I yearn to be understood . And if the story of Maggie O'Brien is n't convincing , maybe the one about Mary Krakoviteh will be ; for I swear to you that the Imperial decoration which the Krakovitches lost did come back to them , and all the way from America to Austria and back again , which I should never have known had I not wandered from the straight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circled me round about . This is the story of triumphant Ireland . Not that I take any political stand on the Irish question , regardless of my plain duty to settle the matter ; but who could know Maggie O'Brien and not cherish the same emotions that the poets tell us are entertained by the Blithe-heart King ? Maggie was said to be hard to get along with ; she had pugnacious black curls that stuck up belligerently , and roused you to an exhilarating sense of combat ; she had a bright blue eye that snapped lightnings , and a tongue as sharp as a needle . Arrah , but she was a colleen ! She used to cone out of her cabin every morning as I went by to pass the time of day with me , and many 's the fine hit of gossip we had against the rest of the neighbors ; for I love to hear the doings and the happenings of all around me , and Maggie 's recitals were always peppered and spiced most appetizingly with bits of malice and cubes of wickedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure , and they 're too good for me , " she would flaunt , dancing from corner to corner of her little cabin on endless unnumbered tasks . I suppose they were patronizing , but would you have them less than human ? They all had flocks and herds and credit at the bank , whereas Maggie had nothing in the world but Mike and the twins and the other two little boys , none of whom could be considered anything of an asset . Mike had landed in that barren valley ten years previously with her and the twins , and a rash balance of fifty dollars . They worked on the ranches when they could get work , bought a bit of stock here and there , and finally got enough together to settle on a homestead . When I went to live with them , after having been mercilessly evicted from my sumptuous dwelling place which included , all in one price , private pond , rowboat. , automobile , and running water , they had got around to building everything but the house . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a splendid big barn . They had been living in the schoolhouse , but when school began , of course , they had to move out , and Mike put a temporary floor in the barn , and there they settled down , all cozy and comfortable , with sliding window sashes and latchstrings instead of doorknobs . I walked in with my suit case and announced : " I 've conic to live with you . Mrs. Garrison bounced me out . " ( I affect the vernacular . ) " Well , come into the parlor , " said Maggie , hospitably , " where we can talk it over . " To ask you to step into the parlor or library or " boodore " was Maggie 's favorite waggery , the divisions of her cabin being purely imaginary . You might think a one-room house would be inconvenient , but it is amazing with what decorum and modesty people can live in one . Many a winter night , as I have sat before the lamp with my embroidery , I became aware of a , stillness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grandfather and the grown nephew were all quietly slumbering in their places with their clothes in neat piles on the floor . How they did it I know not ; it is one of the triumphs of the Irish ! On Sunday nights ( so they would all be clean for school ) Maggie hung a curtain and behold , she had a bathroom ! The same curtain made a private bedroom for specially distinguished guests . But not for me ! I must have the best of all there is in these foreign lands , and Maggie was not to be behind in the showing of manners . Offhand , as a mere matter of the day 's routine , Mike , that very afternoon , brought in lumber and boarded off a stall to make a room for me ; and Maggie lined it from top to bottom with clean flour sacks , so it shone out spotless and fair ; and dragged in the skin of the calf that had blown into the creek the winter before , to serve me for a rug . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and a chair , and I had the wool comforters and the linen sheets and clean towels and wash things . Never was so sweet and dainty a room as that one into which Maggie converted the stall of the barn ; and most cozy and companionable it was , too . If I did not drop to sleep immediately when I crawled in at half past eight , I could start up a conversation with the ones who were sleeping in the hayloft , or in the room outside . Or I could close my door for an afternoon nap , and still know all that was going on without . And the things that happen when you arc hidden from observation are always most charming . You can laugh unrestrainedly or you can scowl with impatience and it makes no manner of difference . You are under no obligation to be amused , but if you should be , your appreciation comes as a gift to those outside . One night , for example , just as I was cuddling down between my mail-order catalogues and flat irons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the little boys in the hayloft . " What 's the matter up there ? " I inquired . The little boy 's shrieks and chuckles left him gasping for breath . " Oo-ee ! " lie chortled . " I was going to lay my head on the pillow and I hit a pile of snow ! " We have magnificent winter weather , starry white at night and Wedgewoodblue by day ; but the fall , before the winter settles down , is apt to be trying , on account of blizzards and high winds . Of course , if you get your cabin chinked up early enough , you are all right , but not one man in ten gets around to it . As you probably know , through the summer the mud dries from between the logs , and it makes no matter , because it 's warm ; but the cracks get bigger and bigger as the years go by , and the logs dry out and shrink , and then you ought to chink it up every fall . I had the wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good wool bathrobe and sweater and socks and mittens , and I put all those on to go to bed and took two hot flatirons and two of the heavy mail-order catalogues , and so kept pretty warm . The catalogues were my own discovery , and a welcome one it was . You put them into the oven before supper and by bedtime they are heated through . Then you put your feet between the leaves and you can turn pages all night , finding warm ones as you go along . As soon as your feet get cold on the diamond necklaces you can turn over to the harness and saddles , and find them quite hot . By morning all these things were cold , though , and we always got up at live to make a fire and get warm . I had the best place , of course , but at that the cat used to crawl into my room from between the logs , and I hid my clothes under my pillow so they would n't be snowed under by morning . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , I learned that if you put your tooth paste tube under your pillow you can squeeze the paste out in the morning without any difficulty . And one day , after one of the all-night dances I had a bad cold and felt so miserable that I could n't sleep . So although a snowstorm was raging , I decided to take a hot bath . I dragged the tub into my room , filled it , and plunged in . And the wind whizzed around the cabin and the snow flew all over me from the cracks , and certain spots of me were boiling hot , and the others were all excited with steam and snow , not knowing what was expected of them , and when I was dressed again , and the tub emptied , I had no more cold than a jack rabbit . Was that a valuable discovery ? Rather ; only it is difficult to find conditions at all times so propitious . We always wore our wool socks and overshoes all day , and when it was necessary to stand still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more hot catalogues to stand on . " Stepping around on snappy stories , " one of my Friends describes it witheringly , as a blast of sarcasm when I yearn too audibly for the wondrous times I have known . Maggie did n't have much to do , fortunately , but make beds and shovel out snow Maggie was an ardent feminist , and stood solidly on her rights . The rest of the neighbors reviled her ? " I suppose she 's a good housekeeper but she do n't know where a cow stands in the barn . " Maggie would not milk cows ; she pretended to be afraid of them ; she would not feed the chickens ; she would carry neither water nor wood . Naturally enough , her husband and children adored her , and she did have the dearest and daintiest house in the valley . But to put parlor , library , kitchen , drawing-room and " boodores " in order every morning meant an eternal folding up and stowing away of bedclothes ; an eternal shoveling of snow and mopping up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hayloft floor , it soaked through the ceiling into downstairs , and during the three days ' blizzards of which I shall tell , I used to move from one spot to another all over the room , as the drops hit me from above . She never got cross about it , at least not with Mike , and there was never any occasion to be cross with the children . As I said , they all adored her . They were most amazing poor , but she let them have all manner of puppies and kittens and lambs , and when they got tired sawing wood she would go and sit on a log to entertain them ; when she called them they came flocking without delay , because it was just as likely to be a currant bun as a hox on the ear which she had to present to them . Mike was the same : he barely provided food for his family ? clothing and shelter they got as best they could ; but hilarity and freedom and delirious happiness he contributed in never-failing abundance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , which Maggie could make over with immense skill for all of them . And when it came to buying other things , she just sat down with the catalogue and made out her order ; then cut off the things she did n't need quite so much ; then the next in order of necessity , and so on till she got down into the limits of her cash balance . Of all the blessed talents of the Irish , I think there is none so charming as this genius for being poor . There was always enough to eat , and Maggie was a good cook ; even when we ran out of butter and sugar and flour , she could still think up appetizing things . To be sure . food was usually cold by the time it was passed around , but that did n't matter ; if the gravy froze into grease before it could be conveyed to our mouths , all we had to do was to carry our plates to the stove and warm them a little ; and when it was extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the heating stove to eat , all cozy and sociable . We were n't careless with our food , either . You never heard of our canned goods freezing , like some people 's . Maggie piled all the cans up against the heating stove every night , and the little boys took turns sleeping with the potatoes . I taught the little boys to knit , and every evening I tore and sewed rags while they knitted a rug of stupendous proportions , which when finished overflowed the parlor into the living room ; and Maggie carded wool , and Mike planed pieces of furniture ? all very primitive and pretty . We had more clean wool than most rich folks . Sheep herders passing through in winter or fall were always willing to donate a stray lamb or sick sheep , and Maggie nursed it lovingly , and cut the wool , and saved it every spring as long as the sheep lasted , but coyotes usually got them before they had a chance to lose the innocence which poets advertise . Indeed , it was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost my standing with the Garrisons . " The poor little thing , " I said , patting its weak , shivery little anatomy , " they went and sheared it too close . " " They do n't shear day-old lambs , " Mrs. Garrison informed me , almost choking with contempt . She repeated it everywhere with despairing comment on my ignorance . I may say , however , that her resultant hostility was one of the things which endeared me to Maggie . " Sure , and you want to be takin ' on a little education from Lett , " she would say at every recital of my many encounters with that alien enemy . I never had to explain my pleasantries to the Irish , and Maggie 's whole-hearted roar was as the piping of meadow larks to my tired soul . The aliens , of whom there were two families , usually referred to the school as the Irish College , arid were always on the point of moving to town where they could associate with a better class of people . Well would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of this narrative is to relate how through me as a humble instrument in the hands of a humorous Providence , Maggie 's children , poor as they were , and despised by the more fortunate as houseless outcasts , even these rose to a pinnacle of glory never to be touched , but to be envied to this very day with all the agony of hopeless yearning . And if the triumph that came to the family of Maggie is not as the glory that fell on Mary Krakovitch , yet in its measure , it is perfect , and I 'm sure Maggie would rather laugh in glee than glow with pride anyway . It came about through the puppy liking me so much . Of course , there is nothing noteworthy about a puppy 's liking anybody who will stand and talk idiotically to him by the hour ? but the consequences of this special attachment were portentous . The boys had sneaked in with him the first day of school , and I had asked him if him was a puppy , or was him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't him a great big doggie like him 's mamma ? The little boys were entranced , and the puppy was frantic . The next day more dogs came , and then more , and more and more , until everywhere you stepped , you fell over an animal . They behaved exactly like children , starting in full of romp and play , and gradually learning the sacred stillness of school , they grew to come in quietly , group themselves about the stove and sleep until recess , when they would arise and march out gravely - with the children . I could n't drive them out ; when I attempted it they would get up and wag their tails , and leap up to kiss me , under the impression that my advances were friendly . All I could do was open the door and say " Sic ' em ! " to which clarion call they responded , to a dog , galloping trustfully down a road where the farthest reach of human eye could see naught but the massive wastes of barren land and moi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Mrs. Garrison took the children away for a week 's vacation , the pup came to me first to ask where they were . took him on my lap and held him all afternoon , while I conducted geography and language ordeals , and he laid his chin on my shoulder , gazing unutterably , with an agony that made the little boys restless and miserable . Well , school went on , and the Irish pup came to school day after day , always faithful , always prompt . We did n't have school very regularly on account of the blizzards ; the snow drifted in so fast , and when there was wind it was too cold even close to the stove . I could sweep up the snow into the cracks and when it froze it was pretty effective in keeping out the wind , but the air never warmed ? once we tried to write by setting the ink bottles in warm water , but the ink froze on the pens while they were being carried from the bottle to the paper . And , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go out of the house at all . So nobody but the O'Briens ever knew whether we were having school or not ; and besides , the aliens did n't like their children to be in the cold schoolhouse all day . Down at the ' Railroad it was better ; on account of prohibition , there was no particular use for the saloon , and so the proprietor allowed the children to have school there when the weather got too bad to use the schoolhouse . The O'Briens , therefore , and the O'Briens ' pup came to school always , and Maggie used to boast about their " educated pup " : " Sure and it takes the Irish to lay on an education , " she would say , especially when one of the alien enemy was close at hand to hear . I do not know whether it was solely the episode of the pup , or whether the incident of the talented kitten had something to do with it , too . It may be that one merely fanned the flame of the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; however , since it aroused the first storm of jealousy that finally raged around the O'Briens it is worth recounting . We had that winter , as I said , two lambs , a pup , a visiting dog , a cat , and three kittens , all on intimate terms with the family . The cats sat patiently by our chairs throughout a meal , while the dogs circled the table expectantly . One day when I dropped an offering , a kitten got it , and growling like a baby lion , darted behind the stove with her prize . I was enchanted . From then on she was my special pride , and I went about boasting of the kitten and its wondrous powers until the children of the enemy grew restive . " The O'Briens must think they 're the only people that got a eat that can growl , " began one of these spoiled darlings , essaying contempt . The O'Brien boys smiled in calm security . The little girl sought evidence to prove the worthlessness of our boast . She began to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cats do not growl . Theirs did n't , the Garrison 's did n't . On slyly questioning , she found nobody who had ever had a cat that growled . Then she began to cry for that kind of a cat , and her hapless parents , who showered on her every- - thing that money could buy , sought in vain for the rare product of felinity . It is my belief that they would have sued piteously of the O'Briens for that cat if it had not been for the long-standing feud between them . But money could not have bought that eat . The boys were puffed up with pride , and Maggie was jubilant . Children never analyze their blessings ? it is enough that blessings come ; and Maggie , being Irish , never cared what the disturbance was about , so that it was there . Singularly , I got no blame for this . Of course , I stopped boasting when the trouble arose , and I was innocent is a lamb of evil intent . No one ever thought of me as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rare species , and the O'Briens , by some strange perversity of fate , were the unworthy possessors of the treasure . " Sure , it pays to have a good advertiser in the family , " chuckled Maggie , as the storm howled without . In the course of time the kitten would have grown to cat 's estate , and got enough to eat , and learned to purr instead of growl , and alien children , finding happiness in the possession of store toys and valuables , would have reduced the O'Briens to the obscurity of the unsubservient poor . But the Irish pup continued to adore me . I always took his part against the visiting dog , and I always left a bite of something in my lunch bucket for him . So when I started out for school the day after the big blizzards , the pup insisted on going , too . The wind had shrieked about the cabin for three days with no pause , except when it changed direction , and when those curious calms came we would laugh to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . Bill had fed the milk-cows out of gunny sacks because the wind blew the hay off the forks ; and he had made dangerous trips to the creek for water , otherwise nobody left the house . The little boys rolled on the floor with the lamb and the puppy and the cats and the visiting dog ; Maggie shoveled snow from the hayloft ; I moved from corner to corner with my embroidery ; the grandfather filed saws excruciatingly ; and the grown nephew played the mouth organ . For three days we lived in an agony of noise and discomfort and cold ; and then , at some unknown hour of the night , we suddenly ceased tossing , and knew nothing until the sun shone on us through the cracks and a celestial hush circled us round about , and when we looked from the door we saw a world like a Portland vase : dark blue , light blue , and glistening piles of white . Every atom of everything had been swept out of the air , and you could see all the Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I said I would have school that day , but the boys need n't come , and I got my snowshoes and started . ( It 's a school day if the teacher is there , and she can draw pay for it ; otherwise not . ) The boys were satisfied , but the pup was not . If there was going to be school , to school was he going . Up he got , vor .. CXLVIL ? No. 877. -7 stretched himself , and was ready . Life in the cabin was , of course , unendurable without the pup ; so presently Maggie had to dress the boys and send them after us . We had a struggle to get the schoolhouse door open , and when we succeeded , we paused in amaze at the sight before us . Snow had drifted all over the desks , and frozen to every crack in the walls . It rayed out all along the stovepipe and from pictures and decorations in fantastic and fascinating designs . We roared most Irishly ; and then set to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , we could n't have any lessons , but we stayed the allotted time , and went back the next day , and so on until the end of the month . I had to , to draw my pay . The pup would not stay at home without me , the boys would not stay where the pup was not , and the days were magnificent . I would have stayed all winter , because I had some traps out , and my trapline crossed at several places the trapline of a. most fascinating young trapper from " the outside , " but I felt it tactful to give up my room to Maggie 's family , so when the month came to an end , I collected my pay and departed . But all unwittingly , as I wrote and signed the various documents , I did the deed that brought anguish to the hearts of the aliens and everlasting glory to the house of Ireland . I was spreading my penmanship over some beautifully lithographed , suitable-for-framing , gold-seal certificates of perfect attendance for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , on the splendor of their achievement ( for I love the sound of my voice ) , when suddenly I became thoughtful . As ever , the pup was beside me , wagging his tail , and cocking his ears expectantly . ( He thought I was eating . ) But if it had n't been for Tippy , they would n't have gone every day , " I said , " Tippy 's the one that ought to have a certificate . " A breathless hush fell on the room . " Tippy shall have one , " I proclaimed , splendidly . And I inscribed , in pugnacious characters , the name of TIPPERARY O'BRIEN , as one entitled to honor for perfect attendance at school and exemplary behavior therein , and I delivered it to his guardians , myself taking his head in my hands and telling him what a wonderful thing an education is , and what a proud dog he should be to have . won this magnificent memento of his industry , and how generations of dogs would delight to call him their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their mother and back again , not understanding why she should laugh . And I packed my trunk and rode blithely away through the snow to a land of steam heat and bathrooms , and knew that lovely spot no more . But Mike got some pieces of smooth lumber and cut up some broken window glass with a piece of oiled string , and made frames for the certificates of his children , and also , in consideration of their howls , made a fifth one for the certificate of Tipperary , the pup . This one was likewise hung on the wall , whereupon the children of the enemy gazed , and comprehended the magnificence of the tribute . For themselves , they did n't care ; they had guns and sleds and polished skis and webbed snowshoes , and gold watches , and all manner of things that the O'Briens lacked ; they did n't care whether they had certificates or not . But that their thoroughbreds should be humiliated by the glory of an ignorant Irish pup ! They went home full of hopeless anguish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always gone to school as much as the O'Brien pup , and ought to have one , andwhy could the O'Brien pup have a certificate and not their dog ? And maybe if they 'd been to school the last day the teacher would have given their dog one , and " it 's all your fault , mamma , ' cause you would n't let me go , and now you have to write to her and ask her to send Jeff one ; will ya , mamma , now will ya ? " Whereupon the mothers denounced me as partial to the Irish , and a mischief-brewer , and declared I had " lots to do " to make trouble in a neighborhood that was always peaceable and friendly before I came to stir up dissension . And the fathers , who would sell a steer any day to buy their loved offspring some bit of expensive nonsense , were helpless in the face of the absolute unobtainability of the one thing which the offspring sickened and well-nigh died for . But the O'Brien boys moved , quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unspoiled by fame , wagged a still friendly tail toward all lesser dogs . They moved on an eminence , these four , for were they not the owners of Tipperary , the sole and only dog in all the world to be possessed of an edueationa/ certificate , signed and sealed and properly displayed , to the lasting fomentation of discord and joyous tur-bulence ? The boys ' happiness is tinctured with the seriousness of childhood , but on the blithe heart of Maggie there is no cloud of gravity . Her black curls rise with exuberant belligerence when the eye of the enemy rests , as perforce it must , on the framed abomination on the wall . " Sure , with the growlin ' cats and the educated pups , it 's hard to beat the Irish ! " she chants , in triumphant mockery . And rapturously the battles rage .
