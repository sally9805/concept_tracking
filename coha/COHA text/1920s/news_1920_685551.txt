txt Opposition to the policy of American supervision of Mexico rests upon the assumption that American interference is necessarily brutal , destructive , and exploiting . It assumes that if tike Americanpeople should give Mexico the benefit of their civilixa ? Lion they necessarily would outrage and rob the people of Mexico , making them wretched and enslaving them . It says that the United States can not be trusted to give Mexico order , peace , and prosperity , and that it is not the intention of the United States to do so . It says that the United States , if it enters Mexico , will do so as ' a robber , and will mistreat a people to give profit to rich American . interests . From what particular source in American history dciee this assumption flow ? From what particular exhibition of American character does it come and upon what experiences is it based ? The United States went into Cuba , and there is no evidence of rapacity there . The Cubans , arejtot bowed down and they are not held in serfdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Porto Rico , and there are no evidences of inhumanity to be found there . The natives are not Imposed upon and they are not robbed of their resources . The United States is in contact with some of the Polynesian peoples , and the ones with which the United States has to do , under navy management , are the only peoples of the south seas who are Increasing . They are protected froin diseases which are carrying off other natives , and they have security and prosperity . The United States is an easy overlord in Hawaii and an easy one in the Philippines . Wherever the flag is or wherever American influence has been controlling there is prosperity , freedom for the individual , and peace . The United States has improved living conditions and has advanced . civilization . It has not robbed and it has not caused suffering . Upon what foundation , then , does the opposition rest its assumption that the purpose in Mexico would be contrary to the revealed purpose of the United States else ; where ? What would so completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard ? It is not a flattering assumption , with its charge that the United Stlites would become a robber na tion by intervening is Mexico , bat has it the faintist suggestion of truth ? The exploitation of Mexico by ' American money could ask for nothing better than a continuance of dishonest Mexican government . That , and not American supervision , will give the opportunity if it is wanted . If American interests . want to raid Mexico all they need do is to subsidize the strongest Mexican government . With enough money they could reestablish slavery in Mexico . American money does not need and would not want the American government in Mexico . Mexican government is made for that purpose . The American 's knowledge of himself and his nation refutes all these slanders . The United States could do for Mexico what it has done for Cuba . It could remove the blight of disorder and raise the living standard of the Mexicans for the good of the entire continent . Mexico is the - disgrace of the United States and its conditions are a reproach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
