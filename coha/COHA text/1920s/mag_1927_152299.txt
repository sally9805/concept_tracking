At Cornell University is the Wilder collection of preserved brains . From their evidence , Dr. James W. Papez , curator , last week concluded scientifically that all physical qualities , such as mass , formation , wrinkles , surface area , prove the female organ equal to the male . Chief among the exhibits in favor of women was the organ of Mrs. Helen Hamilton Gardener , ardent feminist but reasonable debater . Live , she had sought to prove such equality in a book , Sex in Brain . Dead ( in 1925 ) , she had willed her brain as mute , tangible evidence to clinch the argument . In the Wilder collection last week , no brain was found superior to hers .
