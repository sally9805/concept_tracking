It was an Adair who was the conductor of the first railroad train that ever entered Atlanta ( 1845 ) . It was an Adair who was prominent in the rebuilding of Atlanta after Union troops burned the city during the Civil War . Forrest Adair Sr. , present head of Adair family , is a Past Illustrious <P> Potentate of the Shrine ( social organization of 32-degree Masons ) . Thus the failure of Adair Co. was the failure of a great institution . <P> Last week , however , this failure was at least freed from any suspicion of fraud . Forrest Adair Sr. , Forrest Adair Jr. , Frank Adair and E. A. Erwin , officials of the bankrupt firm , were acquitted of using the mails to defraud in connection with the building of three southern hotels which never were completed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month 's trial , a jury decided that the Adair failure was legitimate .
