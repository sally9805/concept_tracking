Dazed and incredulous , the Rumanian people strove to realize , last week , that they and their Royal Family are free at last . Since the foundation of the Kingdom , in 1881 , both people and sovereigns have obeyed , until last fortnight , a family of Dictators . The last of these , Prime Minister Vintila Bratiano , has now been forced to resign ( TIME , Nov. 12 ) ; and last week saw the victorious leader of the National Peasant Party , smart Dr. Juliu Maniu , called upon to form a Cabinet . <P> Up the steps of the Royal Palace in Bucharest bounded Dr. Maniu with a stride swift and confident to the point of indecorum . Pompously the Three Regents of Rumania , who reign for Boy King Mihai , bade Peasant Maniu welcome and requested him to take steps to form a Cabinet . <P> " Here it is ! " cried he , producing from his pocket a crumpled sheet on which was typed : <P> Prime Minister Maniu <P> Foreign Minister Mironescu <P> Interior Vaida-Voevod <P> Finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Health Severdon <P> Public Waterworks Kalippa <P> Transportation Alevra <P> Agriculture Mihalache <P> Justice Junian <P> Culture Aarelolad <P> Commerce Madgearn <P> Most , if not all , of these persons have been hounded by Bratiano secret agents for years . They have seen ballots cast for their candidates torn up and burned by the Bratiano police . Today their turn has come at long last . Down Bratianos : up Peasants ! <P> Two steps at a time the new Prime Minister descended the palace stair , sped to begin work . By a penstroke he abolished the traditional Bratiano censorship of posts , telegraphs , telephones , press . With hearty handclasps he sent his colleagues off to their new Ministries . Then to eager correspondents Dr. Maniu said : <P> " Ours is the triumph of Constitutionalism over Despotism . We shall immediately call for the dissolution of Parliament and hold new , honest elections . . . . <P> " We shall guarantee every citizen full political liberty and establish complete liberty of the press . We shall discuss stabilization of the currency and negotiate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining law passed by the late Prime Minister Jon Bratiano in 1924 , as well as other laws which have made Rumania a most unpopular country abroad . We shall abolish restrictions on foreign capital , which henceforth shall have the same opportunities as local capital . ... " <P> Speculation focused upon whether Prime Minister Maniu will be able to organize a sufficiently stable regime to obtain the vitally needed loan of which he so confidently spoke . That dicker , involving $250,000,000 , was on the point of consummation by Vintila Bratiano , last fortnight , when he was forced to resign as Prime Minister . <P> To trace the obscure rise of Juliu Maniu is to turn back to the days when Rumanian Transylvania was ruled by His Apostolic Majesty , Franz Josef , Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary . Among the least of those who sat in the Hungarian Parliament was Juliu Maniu.
