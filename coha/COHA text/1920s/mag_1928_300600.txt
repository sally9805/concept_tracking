THE CASE OF SERGEANT GRISCHA-Arnold Zweig-Viking ( $2.50 ) . <P> The Story . Much as he liked his German guards and his fellow Russian prisoners , Grischa had had enough of prison camp . True , he had heard that Russia was done for and the War near an end-it was blustery March of 1917-but enough was enough , and he yearned Eastward toward his wife and little girl . His monotonous duty was to pile timber in freight cars bound for the front . At the end of one carload he neatly constructed a cavity for himself , and that night slipped out of the bunk house . Under cover of his comrades ' merrymaking he crunched across the snow to the wire enclosure ; under cover of the wind screaming through ice-ribbed pines he snapped the twanging wires . Three days later he climbed stiff and jolt-bruised from his living coffin , and stumbled into the forests of-Prussia ? Russia ? Poland ? <P> A lynx will not attack a man . But , emboldened by the tastiness of chance corpses that War-winter , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed her crouching to spring . So drolly did her crooked eyes and fringe of whiskers remind Grischa of himself , that he burst into a roar of terrifying human laughter , and unwittingly saved himself from fangs and evil claws . <P> The limpid spring months he spent at an outlaw camp , favorite of the only woman -a girl whose hair had turned white with the War . Babka weaned him body and soul from the starvation of trenches and prison ; then reluctantly sent him on , his identity of escaped prisoner well camouflaged by the clothes and identification-tag of dead Bjuscheff , Russian deserter . <P> In seven languages-German , Russian , Lithuanian , Polish , Yiddish , Lettish , Esthonian-the Germans posted their proclamations , but Grischa could read not one of any seven , and in a few hours he was imprisoned again . For , the newest ordinance read that in the name of discipline all Russian deserters would be executed-dour example to weary-hearted German soldiers . Grischa , alias Deserter Bjuscheff , was promptly sentenced , whereupon he took refuge in confessing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guards , officers , and even old Commander von Lychow . <P> But the " case , " stripped of its humanity , happened to come before Schieffenzahn ( said to be Ludendorff ) , engrossed as he was with annexation , colonization , Germanization , of the whole new border territory . In wholesale efficiency as to forestry , mineral resources , new currency , savings-banks , travelling incinerators , German bookshops , and paper factories for newspapers , insignificant Grischa fell under the category of discipline necessary to state maintenance . In vain did old von Lychow , beloved of his men , argue that it is justice preserves the state : " I know that justice and faith in God have been the pillars of Prussia , and I will not look on while her rulers try to bring them down . " <P> Grischa was shot , having meticulously joined his own coffin , lustily dug his own grave , manfully marched to his death .
