The bugbear of the oil industries has been the large stocks of both crude oil and gasoline on hand . Yet some months ago , as soon as the excessive preceding production had begun to slow up , prices for both crude and gasoline were rapidly jacked up . The oil men in adopting this policy were obviously trusting that production would remain steady or decline further , while consumption would be record-breaking . <P> The lack of enthusiasm current concerning the oil industry has directly resulted from this policy of higher prices . Consumption of gasoline , while in heavy volume , has nevertheless been much less than anticipated , owing to the late Spring and the curtailed motoring season . As a result , gasoline stocks , although declining , are still 2,148,577 barrels . But the higher prices for crude at once stimulated higher production . For the week ending Aug. 16 , output for the country was 2,029,650 barrels- an increase of 19,000 barrels over the preceding week , and only about 235,000 barrels behind the smashing production of mid-August , 1923 . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil , and a lower price level all along the line is expected in some quarters . Only by such means , it is argued , can the large stocks of refined and crude oil be successfully disposed of .
