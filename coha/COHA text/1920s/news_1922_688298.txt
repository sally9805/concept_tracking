txt Protection and Wages . To the Editor of The Neu ; York Tones : In your editorial , " Evading the Main Issue , " you assert that a minimum wage is economically unsound and you call attention to the objections of many working women to " protection " ( personal , not economic ) , they regarding It as injurious interference . Logic and justice might be on the side of your contention if wage earners In.d the right to purchase the necessaries of life at naturally competitive prices ; but with protection accorded to manufacturers , enabling the latter to get fictitious prices for their output , is it any more than fair that laws should be enacted to compel a wider distribution of the benefits of protection ? Presumably it would also ho unsound to limit by law the earnings of protected industries to a maximum percentage and it would be objected to as further interference . Such a limit Would cause a still wider distribution of the earnings of protected industries ? earnings greatly augmetind by tile interference of protection . By Itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the era of high protection is not some device , designed to offset the burdens of the cost of Heine based upon fictitious prices , justifiable ? Or would it be more sound to compel she urge earner and consumer to bear the burd:as artificially imposid upon t1:01:1 till the millennium of taxes based upon the necessities of the Government is reached ? However much one should believe in the justice of the principle of taxation for revenue only ( as I do ) , I think it must be conceded that a sudden reversal to that policy would bring chaos , and the enactment of relief legislation occasionally , intended to effect a wider distribution of the benefits of protection , might tend to gradually bring about ultimate justice in taxation .
