Plump and ever smiling Gaston " Gastounet " Doumergue , bachelor President of France , had brutal murderesses on his hands last week and did n't know what to do with them . If any woman deserved the bloody office of the guillotine , here seemed four worthy candidates : <P> Junka Kures , a Serbian ( TIME , Nov. 19 ) , strangled a little girl with a shoelace and then abused the corpse . <P> Rawboned Marie David crammed a sponge down the throat of a neighbor 's baby that cried too much . <P> Blanche Vabre , even bigger and more forbidding than Mme. David , chopped off the ten fingers which her 16-year-old stepson had raised in terror to protect his throat , and with another slash almost severed the boy 's neck . <P> Juliette Brucz , with a passion for Dumas novels , turned the gas on her sleeping husband and went upstairs to read The Count of Monte Cristo . <P> So brutal were these crimes that the French press was led to believe that the long-standing tradition might be broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1887 . But kindly " Gastounet " ended by commuting all four death sentences to penal servitude for life . They will never go free . " Life imprisonment " in the U. S. often means 20 years in jail , with time off for good behavior . In France it is a sentence that means just what it says .
