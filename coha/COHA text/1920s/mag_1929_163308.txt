As a result of the ending of Mexico 's religious troubles 80 nuns were ordered released from the penal islands of Tres Marias ( The Three Marys ) . But Madre Maria Concepcion Acebedo de la Llata , " intellectual author " of the murder of President-Elect Alvaro Obregon ( TiME , Sept. 3 , et seq. ) remained behind . <P> Remembering bloodthirsty stories of France 's Devil Island and Italy 's Lampedusa , meticulous Robert A. Maier , Mexican correspondent of Berlin 's Lokalan-zeiger anticipated the first anniversary of General Obregon 's death by going to visit Mother Concepcion , to see for himself what a Mexican penal island is like . <P> The Three Marys-Maria Magdalena , Maria Madre , Maria Cleofas-lie off Tepic on Mexico 's West coast , 60 miles out in the Pacific . They can only be reached by a wheezing , blunt-nosed government steamer from dusty Mazatlan . Armed with dark glasses and a large cotton sun umbrella , Newsman Maier took this steamer , chugged out to Maria Madre , the largest island . There he found Mother Concepcion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knitting undershirts . Breathlessly he told her of the end of Mexico 's religious troubles . Mother Concepcion laid down her undershirt , smiled composedly . She was " full of faith in the future . " <P> Fears of the pious that Mother Concepcion was imprisoned in a melodramatic Living Hell were quieted by Herr Maier 's article , published last week . Excerpts : <P> " The greater proportion of the prisoners seem to have become accustomed to their lot . Most of them , especially those convicted of capital crimes , are carefree and gay . . . . Their treatment by the guards , mostly trusted prisoners , is humane . Corporal punishment has long since been abolished by the Governor of the island . <P> " I tasted the food and found it palatable . Mostly highly seasoned cooking that people hereabouts like . <P> " Keepers and supervisors have their own little cottages surrounded by attractive little gardens planted by the prisoners . <P> " Convicts here are divided into four classes in accordance with their behavior . Privileges consist of extra food and extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement without any supervision . "
