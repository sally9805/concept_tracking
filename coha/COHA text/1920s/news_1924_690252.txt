txt Our club editor , Miss Webber , attending the annual convention of the Illinois Federation of Wmnen 's Clubs , reports that applause greeted the recommendation of the president . lire . George T. Palmer , ' that clubs observe due caution In joining ostensible peace organizations and against being carried away by peace-abany.price talk , which is a cloak for sedition . May we hope this sensible warning and the approval with which it was received testify to an awakening among normal women to the interrelation of revolutionary ; radicalism of all varieties , foreign propaganda and pacifism ? Once that interrelation is realized the widely organized pacifist movement , which has of late come conspicuously ' to the-surface in several of the evangelical churches and In the colleges , will meet proper resistance . Confusion of thought will be done with and well meaning organizations will escape the danger of giving support to demomlizing.influences the nature and ends of which the American public is only beginning to suspect . The peace movement in America long antedates the world war , and , though , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinister foreign influences , it was during the war and since that its most mischievous characteristics have appeared . ' We saw , how enemy propaganda allied itself at once with pacifism and radicalism to weaken the country in its war effort , and while conditions have changed in some degree , the ' for -- eign influence in our pacifist movement is still clear .. The representative of - the German youths ' peace movement , speaking at the pacifist confer once at the University.of Chicago , called the campaign of foreign pacifists " an invasion of the United States . " and her description was far more significant than she probably intended . The United States is suffering from a most powerful , persistent . and many sided Invasion of foreign interests . This invasion is directed against our traditional international  |p3licy  , against our institutions and principles , against the organization of the nation 's defense . It is at . work to involve us in European political entanglements , through the gate of the league or otherwise , to stimulate partisanship in European quarrels , to obscure our sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our defenses and discredit our patriotism . This is indeed an invasion , a mischief more likely to be victorious than an armed invasion , for it Is more insidious , and therefore , less . likely to be combated . Alrenily we see in the churches and colleges the extent of its advance , The tendency of organizations , inexperienced and uninformed as most of us In America are as to European conditions and methods , to accept at face value appeals on lofty altruistic grounds , is also apparent . American woman , with her ideals of service , her pity and generosity , is naturally receptive to such appeals , and , possessed of the vote , can register her emotion in the policy and upon the fate of her country as never before , This is to be welcomed , provided nisvays it is directed by Intelligent consideration of realities . Amerlean women 's duty and interest to protect our birthright are identical with American men 's . It is theirs to help defend the fireside and keep our strong and long-proved roof over our henda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement in the face . They will ask how it is that he most pacific power on earth is being exhorted by alien emissaries to be peaceful . to put by its time tried policies , foreign and home , and to retrace O. ! steps of our forefathers , who wisely and beneficently left the old world to be tree front its immemorial strife and free to follow a new destiny . Although America threatens and oppresses no one , our pacifists tell us that we dare not be strong lest we abuse our strength . Whether honestly confessed , or , as in most cases , evaded , that is a policy of . nonresistance. - Quibbles and sophistries should not deceive us . Pacifism works for an America too weak to enforce its right or defend Its existence . Normal . clear eyed American womanhood can . no more adopt such as doctrine than American manhood . It is the duty of both to refuse to adopt It in the sophistical guise of a false altruism.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
