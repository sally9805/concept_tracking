txt It Is a year since the average price of twenty railroad stocks recorded the figure of 84 . It was , in fact , in the early part of June , 1923 , that this joint was reached with a rally from below 81 which did not hold . Since August 4 of last year , however , the railroad average had not been as low as 75 or as high as 84 . Since the middle of January it has not touched 78 or crossed 84 until the advance of June 11 . There has , in fact , been a " line " for six months past , within the narrow range of four points , and the average has now emerged on the upward side . In discussing the stock market barometer in this place , not for tips on the stock market but for its forecasting value as regards the business of the country , it has always been pointed out that the averages should confirm each other . There has been no such corresponding line in the industrial stocks , although something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a range of rather over five points , and the industrials are now close to the upper side of that line . What is significant in the barometer is what the railroad average has done , or , perhaps more exactly , has not done , without contradiction by the industrials . A little thought will show no paradox in saying that accumulation and distribution mean nearly the same thing . With the present public investment interest in the market what looks like accumulation by the line in the averages has really been a wide distribution into the safe hands of the small investor . In the old days there was such a thing as buying for accumulation by a single interest or small group of interests . But the days of capturing the control of a railroad by purchase of the stock in the public market have gone by . The railroad stocks have been bought on their investment value , dividend or no dividend , and it is significant that any line of value calculated upon the actual dividends and the surplus available for distribution would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad stocks . This is a good sign because it shows that the vagaries of Congress in the past six months have not disturbed the confidence of the permanent investor and this argues an underlying confidence in the general business of the country . It may even be that the tax bill as finally passed into bziw has stimulated the small investor , with a maximum income from all sources of not More than $10,000 a year , and perhaps much less . This is not to say that the Mellon plan would not have been better for him , for it would have tended to give him a cost of living a thousand dollars lower as against a reduction in income tax of a tenth of that amount . Whatever the varying causes may have been , the bull point in the railroad averages is an uncommonly cheerful sign . The course of the market after it was recorded seems to indicate that a higher level would have to be established in order to provide a floating supply of stock equal to growing investment requirements .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
