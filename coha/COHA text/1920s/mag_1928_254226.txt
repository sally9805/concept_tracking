The dusky , lustrous eyes of Roman citizens grew large and moist with awe , last week , when a Papal medal as big as a smallish soup plate was borne pompously across the " Eternal City . " <P> He for whom the medal had been cast was no happy man . Pain twitched his broken leg . Enemies were reviling him as , " That Coward Nobile ! The first airship captain who was first to leave his ship ! " ( TIME , July 23 . ) <P> Such lashing words must have cut deeper than pain ; but suddenly their sting was soothed , as the great , soup-plate-like medal arrived and was placed in the trembly hands of General Umberto Nobile . Immediately his careworn features relaxed , and he seemed to bask at length in Peace . <P> Protestants might scoff , or heretics sneer . The slant eyelids of infidels might even lower in sedate winks . But General Umberto Nobile clung to the medal as tangible proof that his pious deed of dropping a large Papal cross on the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor in the eyes of the Most Blessed Father and Supreme Pontiff , Achille Ambrogio Damiano Ratti , Pope Pius XI . Enthusiastic , His Holiness sent along with the medal his " warmest congratulations , " and finally imparted a solemn Papal blessing . <P> Said the grateful and pious Nobile : " Part of our motion picture film was lost . We had to burn it in an effort to keep warm . But we spared the footage showing me in the act of dropping emblems* upon the North Pole . " <P> Blessed and congratulated , General Nobile eventually told correspondents that he carries in his head a number never known to man , a number which may prove to be the crowning achievement of his expedition , a number which he described as " the horizontal component of the magnetic field . " <P> A short time before the Nobile dirigible Italia plunged to destruction the " magnetic component " was worked out by Professor Aldo Pontremoli , who is now missing on the Polar ice . " He came toward me radiant with joy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calculation at last . He told me the figure , which , fortunately , I can still remember . Whoever is acquainted with these scientific problems will realize the immense value of this discovery . " <P> <P> * Beside the Cross there were dropped the flags of Italy and Milan ( Nobile 's native city ) .
