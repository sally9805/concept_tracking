The dark unrest that lurks at the bottom of the coal industry , even at its best , broke out again last week in Mather , Pa . The Mather mine , owned and operated by Pickands , Mather &; Co. of Cleveland , is one of the model mines of the U. S. In its shafts are all the modern appliances for air , light , production , safety . Run on an open-shop basis , it employs some 750 men steadily , 300 days in the year . The town is clean . The Mather men are contented . <P> One afternoon last week , just as the night shift was going down to its subterranean duty , a convulsion shook the galleries , a blast of air rushed up the shafts followed by a belch of hot , black smoke . The night men scrambled back for safety . Some were killed in the tunnels by falling roofs . Some bratticed themselves in offsets and telephoned for help . Then came the deadly " afterdamp " ( carbon monoxide ) . <P> How many men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was impossible to tell . Perhaps 200 men had been in the workings when some improbable spark ignited the lurking mine gas . Rescuers pressed in , passing by corpses , to look for survivors , carrying canaries to test the air . At the shaft mouths , miners ' families waited in silence . A score of bodies were taken out , then a dozen more . Rescued men told their stories . The neighborhood and the industry mourned , condoled , tried to forget . ..
