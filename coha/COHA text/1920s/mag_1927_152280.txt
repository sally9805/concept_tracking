Her majesty Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes , Queen over the British Commonwealth of Nations , bent her knees and lifted her feet in dashing oldtime dances at Balmoral , royal Scottish home . <P> It was at the gillies ' ( servants ' ) ball given by the King and Queen to 300 tenants and employes on the royal estates in Scotland . Clasped by gardeners , game wardens , footmen , chefs , guests , Queen Mary reeled and pivoted in twelve of the 14 Highland flings , polkas and Circassian circles that were on the program . <P> Noted was her glee ; but haughty aristocrats , perforce , put on a grin that hardly covered their disdain : a Queen hobnobbing with servants !
