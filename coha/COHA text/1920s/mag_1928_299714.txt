Straw Hats Sirs : <P> <P> This story-under Miscellany-will , I believe , prove of interest to your readers . <P> <P> FRANCIS W. CLINTON <P> New York City <P> The story , no Miscellany , is as follows : <P> <P> ' ' The custom of discarding straw hats on September 15 is not a new one . It originated forty years ago . <P> " In those days horses were outfitted with straw hats to protect them from the sun . In the Brooklyn firehouses on September 15 , the fire gong would ring and , with great formality , the horses ' straw hats would be destroyed . <P> " The hatters of that time took up the notion , erected gongs outside their stores , and established the fifteenth as the date when no he-man would continue to wear his straw hat . " <P> <P> To Subscriber Francis Wright Clinton , President of the Danbury Hat Co. , thanks and $3. - ED . <P> Advertising , Circulation <P> Sirs : <P> Here 's one letter you wo n't publish . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 4 names-count ' em-and how you fellows fawn before wealth ) you neglected to state that this prominent member of the nouveau riche is the wife of a man , who after growing rich under Republican regimes and policies , deserted his party SOLELY FOR RELIGIOUS REASONS . His talk about prohibition is THE BUNK . He obeyed his master the pope , in the same way that " Everything " Al would obey that master . <P> This man Raskob had more to do with injecting the subject of religion into the campaign than anyone else and I have heard him called some pretty hard names . You however , in view of some big advertising contracts that you already may have , have evidently singled him out for unlimited esteem . <P> But in order to get and hold these contracts , you might at some future date , have to show increasing circulation , and it will be this writer 's delight to keep said circulation below normal . I have spent my last 15 for TIME . <P> The rumor ( more or less verified here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend $100,000,000 to elect him by foul means or fair , but it is not believed that that amount of money can buy the self respect and conscience of America . It 's a dirty business they 're engaged in and I regret to see a magazine I once admired collaborating with men determined to buy the Presidency of my country . <P> <P> R. J. WILSON <P> San Francisco , Calif . <P> <P> In Minneapolis Sirs : <P> <P> Being one of the original subscribers to TIME and knowing your interest in the unusual , I thought that you would be interested in an unusual , and interesting type of building that is being erected at the present time at Minneapolis , Minnesota and for which we are the Architects and Engineers . <P> This building which is 32 stories in height is being erected for the W. B. Foshay Company who own and operate electric power utilities .
