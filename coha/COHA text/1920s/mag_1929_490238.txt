MAYBE New York never was as torn up as now , though one loses a sense of comparison after hearing that from childhood on . Anyhow , the turmoil is not without a special charm . Rebuilding in Manhattan is always exposing remote corners of Nineveh , out of a forgotten past . The commoner may stand , and does , before a marble palace like a doll 's house and picture just what happened , and where , in the days when there was a floor in the room instead of only the housewrecker 's void and the outline of a mantel on the wallpaper . We were reminded of this fleeting charm by the northeast corner of Sixth Avenue and Thirty-fifth Street . A building has come down and exposed the next wall , that of the Garrick , once Harrigan 's , on which in paint still bright one may read : " Francis Wilson in ' When Knights Were Bold .

There being more pauses , there is more chafing at red lights , and more spurting between them . That gives the feeling of swift progress . Very likely it will be a generation before the full effects of the quickening become apparent enough for the scientific Fellows to measure them . These machinal rhythms are really very subtle ; it is by such nice devices that man supplants the urge of hours and tides and the phases of a moon which he never sees . The signals are the pulse heat of the mass . The individual reacts to them knowing it or not . He : len his reflexes conditioned . Twenty --  five seconds for east-west instead of fifty-five . Eighty-five for north-south instead of a hundred and fifteen . The macrocosm has a new rhythm and the microcosm is regimented to fit in like a corpuscle . It is wearing . It is also boring .

These lights have n't enough imagination . SOMETHING will soon have to be done about the hook situation , which has got even worse than the traffic situation and may have to he solved first . Five thousand hooks , a new record , are on the publishers ' fall lists . Biographies alone far outnumber automobiles now , and they are .. 5+1 multiplying like rabbits . They leap out at you like rabbits too , from unexpected places . Most recently they began to leap out From cigar stores , for Schulte 's , or United , or perhaps both , have just begun to sell publishers ' leftovers at two-thirds off . In one store we were in , the book counter took up more space than the cigar counter . This uses up a busy man 's time , for it is impossible to ignore a book sale completely , and just walk away .

AT the corner of Madison and Fifty- ' 1- seventh there is a sign that has , it seems to us , its cosmic intimations . It goes like this : " Kaskel , Kaskel Dunlap will open a new shop , devoted to men 's haberdashery and women 's sportwear . " Are we wrong in ascribing to this new venture a more than casual recognition of the tender passion ? Where better can the young men of the town meet the young women than at a store dedicated to their joint whims ? Where else can they see each other in so true a light as in a store where the men , all haber and dash , are purchasing cravats , and the girls , all sportive and wearing , are buying polo shirts ?
