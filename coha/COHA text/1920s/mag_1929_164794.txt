MY LIFE OF MAGIC-Howard Thurston - Dorrance ( $2.50 ) . <P> For 40 years Thurston , successor to the late great Kellar , has been extracting rabbits from the collars of old gentlemen 's overcoats , smashing expensive watches , bisecting young girls , making them disappear , float in the air . He has had three challenges ( in foreign countries ) from young men whom he humiliated in public by demonstrating that they concealed a duck on their persons . He began with $00.25 , and now has a home on Long Island . In this book he tells his adventures as a showman . <P> At ten , he ran away from Columbus , Ohio , hovered about racetracks , sold papers , learned how to bum .

He joined a roadshow , a circus , organized a show of his own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as junior partner , succeeded him . Now he is 60 , successful , reminiscent . <P> Thurston is now Houdini . He describes his tricks , but never explains them . His most sensational " illusion " was chopping off a friend 's head . Because women fainted he never repeated it . He is contemptuous of Oriental " magic . " Out of three thousand fakirs he examined in India , not one had even heard of the rope trick . ( A rope is thrown into the air , is mysteriously suspended while a boy climbs up it , disappears . ) The easiest people to fool , says Thurston , are scientists , men-of-letters , psychologists . The hardest are lawyers and preachers because " they do not lose their poise " when invited on the stage . <P> Thurston was a great success in China . He likes the Chinese . Once he gave a performance at the White House , borrowed Calvin Coolidge 's watch , seemingly smashed it to bits . Mr. Coolidge was imperturable , said nothing . Thurston returned the watch unharmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion for the world . "
