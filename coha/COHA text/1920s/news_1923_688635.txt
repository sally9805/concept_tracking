txt The endowment fund of the New York l'uttlic Library was increased $6,000,000 yesterday through gifts of 83.000.000 Made by John D. Rockefeller Jr. , $2,000. - 000 by Payne Whitney , a trustee of the library . and 51,000,000 by Edward S. Harkness . also a trustee . The large donations to the endowment fund of the library were announced by Lewis Cass Isedyard . President of the Board of Trustees , at a regular meeting of the board yesterday afternoon . It was explained . however , that : the generosity of Mr. Rockefeller . Mr. Whitney and Mr. llarknees would by no means relieve the institution from raising additional endowment to provide for the demands of a rapidly increasing reading public . and that a further increase of at least $500,000 a year would be needed to provide for the normal growth of the library . The fund created yesterday will be devoted to the reference department , enabling it to operate for the time being . without deficit and to . make up arrears in binding , cataloguing and book purchasing , necessary functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tile eelst of operation during and since the war . Mr. Ledyard. in his statement . which sketches the history of the library 's financial status , says : " The building belongs to the city , but isaw.erlso the Library , which furnishes the books and pays the whole cost of operation , except the physical repair of the building , out of the income of the endowment fund of the Library . Growth of Endowment Fund . " In November . 1922 , the endowment fund of the Library amounted to nearly 515.500,000 . Thiswas an increase in eleven years of about 50 per cent . The increase in the use made of the Library by the public and in the service rendered by it , and in the consequent cost of operation , has , however , greatly exceeded the increase in endowment . During the eleven years from 1912 to 1922 , while the endowment was Inc n-ased a little less than 50 per cent .. the number of books annually consulted increased 100 per cents from 1.307.676 Ir ' 2.649. tsi0 , and the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1.225,77S . " This increased service had to be rendered while the purchasing power of the Library income was reduced almost to one-half by the immensely increased cost of all labor and material . Accordingly , with the strictest economy , the cost of operation during these eleven years was increased 113 per cent. , from 5424.306.63 in 1912 to . S905.961.33 in 1922 . Because of the increase of service and the increase in the cost of living , the salary roll had to be increased during the eleven years from 8:257,104.22 to $672.079.84 , or about 160 per cent . This was absolutely necessary : otherwise the Library would have had to close . Indeed , it is the fine loyalty of the staff rather than their compensation which keeps the force in efficient service . Annual deficiencies came to be regularly incurred . In 1919 there was a deficit of about $60,000 , in 1920 $251,000 , in 1921 $151,000 , and in 1922 $14- ' , 000 . Each year these deficits were made up by the personal gifts of trustees and friends of the Library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was only through such gifts that the Library was able to buy books . The endowment supplied no income available for that purpose and the Library was beginning to be starved front insufficient appropriations for the purchase of books . A library , of course , that does not keep abreast with the times in all branches of human knowledge ceases to be useful and becomes a mere storehouse . Under these circumstances the gift now announced is of the most vital importance . It came about as follows : Early in 1922 a thorough and systematic study of the oserations , the efficiencyand the needs of the Reference Department was undertaken by experts . These experts were independent and di ; - interested examiners . Their examination was thorough and complete , and upon the facts ascertained and analyzel by them they reported that an addition of not less than ** to the endowment fund of the institution was absolutely necessary to its continued efficient operation , and that a further annual increase of that endowment of an average of at least 8500,000 in each yea. - will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They realized that the amount thus found by them to be necessary was a very large one . ? However , ' they added , ? it does seem that the time is propitious for rendering an important god permanent service to an unusually - useful and well-managed institution . ' This situation being presented tG ** D. Rockefeller Jr . he offered , in substances to contribute to the endow- ment fund of the library up to 53,000 , - 000 , provided an equal amount was given by other persons , and his offer having been made known to two of our trustees , Payne ' Whitney and Edward S. Harkness , Mr. Whitney agreed to contribute $2,000,000 and Mr. Harkness agreed to contribute $1,000,000 to secure the full acceptance of Mr. Rockefeller 's offer . " The income to be produced by this great addition to our endowment fund will enable the library to operate its reference department for the present without a deficit . and . In addition , will enable it to make up some of its arrears in binding , cataloging and book purchasing ; hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will not relieve the institution from the necessity of raising additional endowment to provide for the ever increasing demand upon its service to the Public . " The foregoing statement relates only to the Reference Department of the New York Public Library and the Central Circulating Library , Which is operated in the main building at Forty-second Street , both of which are maintained by the endowment fund of the institution . 1r In addition to this , the New York Public Library operates a system of branch circulating libraries throughout the Boroughs of Manhattan . Richmond and the Bronx , consisting of fortytivo branch circulating libraries and six sub-branches . " Substa.ntially , the whole cost of maintenance and operation of this latter system is contributed by the City of New York . The appropriations made by the city for this purpose in each of the last four years have been in excess of $1,000.000. "
