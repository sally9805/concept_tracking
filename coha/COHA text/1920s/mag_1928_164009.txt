Last week the British Empire Leprosy Relief Association announced that a positive cure for leprosy had been effected . Hydnocarpus oil is the new remedy . For ten concentrated years scientists have been working to extract an oil from the dried fruit of the hydnocarpus tree that could safely be used in the fight against leprosy . The virtues of this oil have long been known , but its use was restricted because it blocked the veins and choked off the blood stream . Since bacillus leprae exists in the circulating blood as well as in the organs and tissues , a destructive agent that could be released directly into the blood stream was desirable . Hitherto the treatment of leprosy has consisted of injections of chaulmoogra oil into the muscles , which is a less direct attack on the microbe . As now perfected , hydnocarpus oil has a 100% efficiency in the early stages of the disease , and 30% in the advanced stages . <P> The Leprosy Relief Association plans to establish a chain of relief stations fully equipped with drugs , throughout the Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be planted in all the British possessions . <P> Leprosy is not an infectious disease , the germs are not carried through air or water ; but it is contagious and is communicated by direct contact .
