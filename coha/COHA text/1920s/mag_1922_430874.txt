IT is only by removing oneself some distance from a thing that one is able to see it in its proper perspective and value . And that holds true whether the thing in question is a mountain-peak or a picture , or a reversal in business or in love , or a world-war , or the forward march of women . The close-up view is rarely the true view . Accordingly , when I first returned to America , after a three years ' absence in Europe as war-correspondent ? three violent and absorbing years spent in constant traveling to and fro and up and down the face of that ravaged and distracted continent , in Italy , France , Belgium , and Germany ? I rediscovered American women . Coming upon them thus , after such an absence , and from such a distance , I got , for a moment , a detached , an impersonal point of view . It was like catching a sudden glimpse of the firm outlines of a mountain-peak from the tail of a speeding observation-car . My observation-car or coign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in history ; the mountain-peak was the American women in the mass , of which I had never before caught the bold and significant outlines for the simple reason that , hitherto , I had been part of the mountain myself ? one of its millions of atoms ! Soon again I would fuse with those atoms , become a part of the mountain , and lose the external point of view . But in that illuminating moment of transi- tion , I viewed them as a foreigner might ? and it was almost like coming upon a new race ! Let that stand as my first , clean-cut impression of American women , after a sojourn among continental peoples for three years . How they loomed ! How amazingly independent , intelligent , competent , and alive they were ! How coolheaded in planning , how business-like and sure in attack ! What superb confidence ! What breezy get-thereness and elan ! In Europe , women are still swaddled in the cramping bonds of tradition ? even the English women . With the women on the Continent ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans ? these bonds are still worse ; worse than we or they can realize . And it is only by an abrupt juxtaposition of the women of the two continents , such as the late war afforded , that one can see how far along the road of individual liberty the American woman has come . Thinking of the forward march of women as a stupendous , far-flung battleline whose ends are the dark places of earth , the American sector is marked by a sudden big jutting salient , a fine , bold , outward sweep of advance . Regarded thus , in the large , American women hold the advanced skirmish-line ? which is as it should be , if America is to make good her proud boast as the pace-maker in democracy . Looking more closely ? though still from a bird's-eye point of view ? at our own particular segment of that mighty battleline of women struggling toward the light , one fact immediately stands forth clear . Our portion of the line is uneven . At one point it is carried far forward in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it drops away . This sudden sharp forward thrust in the line is the American woman 's remarkable advance in industry , in economic independence ? an advance such as the world has never before seen ; the corresponding drop is her present position in politics , where , as compared with her progress in industry , she lags far behind . The reason for this unevenness of advance is that America 's biggest development has been , not along political , but industrial lines , and the women have simply followed the national trend . In industry , women have behind them approximately three generations of schooling ; they are experienced , poised , alert . In politics , they are still in the primer-class . They are like chicks which have just burst their shells ; the world before them is theirs , but they do n't know what to do with it ! Therefore , just as a kind of historical guide , a unit of measurement , so to speak , in this new field of politics , let us take a brief backward glimpse at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how it came about . The advancement of America to her present powerful position as world-leader in industry is due to three prosaic factors : coal and iron and steam . Before those three titan-forces of nature began to change the stream of its development , the country was largely agricultural in character , simply because it had no means of cheap transportation . So the women lived in their homes , and their occupations were home occupations . This was before 1840 . Up until that period , it is recorded , there were but seven occupations by which a woman might gain a livelihood . These consisted of teaching , needlework , keeping boarders , working in cotton-mills , at bookbinding , and type-setting , and household service . Compared with the wide range of women 's occupations today , what a scanty list ! But before r84o , women were kept busy in their homes . For in those times , much more than now , the unit of the nation was the family ? and the care of the family was largely the woman 's affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity centered . Each family produced the bulk of its own food , clothes , and , not seldom , its own furniture . Educational and religious instruction was part of the daily regime . Even the amusements were home-made ! Each home was a small solar system , of which the mother was the life-giving sun . But with the discovery and application of steam as a propelling power , a tremendous change was inaugurated . Swift trains replaced the slow prairie-schooners ; steamboats began to ply up and down the great rivers . Cheap transportation opened up our vast western territories for exploitation , and the smoke from innumerable factories and foundries began to darken and pollute the sky . Before 184o , America was a hand-made nation , her chief motive power in the family ; after 1840 , she became a machine-made nation ? an iron- and coal- and steam-made nation , whose chief motive power was in her industries . The title of this chapter in American history might ironically be called , " Exit the American Family ! " Very few people today realize this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speeding up of American life and its direct influence upon the women . For the very first thing these three powers of iron and coal and steam did to women was to drag them out of the home . Gradually , most of the occupations which had hitherto been performed in the family , the washing and the baking and the spinning and the clothes-making , began to be done on the wholesale plan outside . Factory towns , like monstrous mushroom growths , sprang into being almost overnight . With the stupendous demand for unskilled labor of every description , women were pressed into service , and still the supply came nowhere near meeting the demand , and vast floods of immigrants began to pour in upon our shores . So began that tremendous tidal wave of industrial development which struck America , induced by those three great kings of nature , King Coal and King Iron and King Steam . The seven original occupations of women increased and multiplied into thousands , alphabetically listed and card-indexed , until now it is no longer astonishing to learn in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a marineengineer , or that , with the appointment of police-women in New York , the hand that rocks the cradle rules the traffic of the business world . It should be noted in passing that , as a class , the American women did not , with malice aforethought and aggressive eagerness , leave their homes and their children to fare forth into this strange , new , clangorous industrial world . The female of the species does not do that sort of thing . And the American female is just the same as any other kind when it comes to guarding the home . The fact is , they went with dragging and reluctant feet , troubled and afraid . But the vast , irresistible stream of industry had caught them , and they had to swim with the tide ? or sink . Conservative preachers of that day thundered at them from their pulpits . Fathers scolded . Mothers wept . And their daughters , the younger generation , went out into the world just the same , as youth always will ! That was the transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have rooted and established themselves in the economic life of the nation ; they have reached out into practically every field of business endeavor ; they have become experienced , resourceful , alert . In a word , they have proved themselves . They have made good . Nor did they , after the war , lose any of their industrial gains , as has been the case abroad , notably in France and England , the reason being that in America women did not owe their economic independence to the war . They had won their spurs long before ! This transition period in industry , already blurred and forgotten in our phenomenal advance , is now being once more enacted ? this time in the field of politics . Where women stood three genera-tions  | ago , uncertain , troubled , and afraid , thundered at by the conservative elements of the church and press , on the threshold of an industrial expansion vast beyond any man 's dream , they stand again today , in the arena of politics . And as they went into industry , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as factors in the mighty industrial march of the country , so now they are entering this new field , not to exploit their own personality , but in response to a clarion call of need . Today , America stands at the . cross-roads . Her development as a nation calls for a clean-up in politics ; a revitalizing of the old forms ; more conscience , more character and honesty in public office . Thinking men all over the country have realized this need . Now is the time to affirm and reaffirm the power of the human will , imagination , and intelligence to bring about something in politics which approaches the fulfilment of human nature . And the opening  | of the political door to women is an admissior that they are needed to help negotiate the dangerous curve in the national life which lies directly ahead . That , in a word , is woman 's job in this new partnership with man ? to put a conscience into politics . This task is not one which can be performed in a day , Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics overnight ? as some of the recent elections have proved . They have the vote , it is true . But they are still uneducated , incoherent , unmobilized . They do not know what they want , or even what they think they want . Hence , their present advance is a wabble . This is largely due to lack of experience , confidence , poise . How shall they run before they can walk ? Women Need Political Education Their greatest lack at this juncture is education ? education along practical lines . They must be taught the abc of local politics which touch directly the welfare of their homes and their children 's lives . Hitherto , they have been prone to think of politics as something cloudy , vague , remote , such as voting for a President ; and , unfortunately , the first big general election in which the women of the nation participated , confirmed that false point of view . Many women , even the trained leaders , were deeply disappointed at the outcome of the elections ; they had hoped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to operate at one hundred percent efficiency to regenerate politics . But it did not work out that way . It never does ! For to put character and conscience into politics , women must begin , not at the top of the pyramid , at national conferences and grand pow-wows , but down at the bottom , in the sub-cellar basement of the structure , in prosaic municipal affairs . In this task of educating the women in the abc of practical , every-day local politics , two agencies , the National Federation of Women 's Clubs and the National League of Women Voters , have done yeoman service . For some years the Women 's Clubs have had a special department for the study of municipal administration , and now that women actually possess the franchise , these departments have become centers from which trained workers " have gone forth to fight for better conditions in thousands of towns . These departments can be made inestimably valuable in educating women in municipal affairs . Here the records of local party leaders should be kept , with a blunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to the query : " In view of the above record and personal character , should this man be elected to office ? " It goes without saying that the worth of such a record depends absolutely upon its non-partisanship . This department , also , should be the center from which political clinics and classes are established in the more congested districts of the town , much as health-centers and milk stations are at present established . These , as elections approach , render great service by imparting non-partisan information and preventing intimidation at the polls . To one such political clinic came the wife of a local fruit-dealer , an Italian , who betrayed no interest in the proceedings until one night she discovered that she did not have to vote like her husband ? that she could cast her ballot in secret and he would never know . After that , there was no more eager questioner in the beginners ' class ! She had discovered that her vote , like her conscience , was her very own . In cities and towns these abc-classes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But in the country , and especially in the more sequestered sections , the situation is different . Here , the main question is to get the women together . Bad roads , lack of transportation , or manifold duties keep the country woman isolated , homebound ; and yet it is the country woman , even  | more than her city sister , who stands to be benefited by actual participation in local affairs . This ? problem is a knotty one , and it has not yet been adequately solved , but both the clubs and the granges are attacking it sturdily . The other agency which has been extremely active in educating women in the abc 's of practical politics is the National League of Women Voters , which has established branches in every state and scattered its teachers broadcast . Upon a recent occasion , I accompanied one of these teachers to her afternoon class . While on our way , at a crowded street-corner , . we encountered a crowd of boy-hoodlums , ogling the girls , whistling , and calling out , " Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they passed . The teacher took note of these demonstrations and marked that there was a large public school near . From the traffic policeman she gathered the significant fact that three thousand school-children passed that corner each day . Armed with this knowledge , the teacher had the first sentence of her primer lesson all ready when she faced her class . " What about that gang of young toughs which I saw operating on the street-corner ? " she began abruptly . " Sure , " said a woman , rising from the rear row , " they fair pester the life out of the childer coming home from school . " " I have to stop work every morning and take my two girls to school , and then go an fetch them home again ! " declared another irate mother . Others testified eagerly . The upshot of the discussion was that a committee was formed which complained in person at the City Hall , and the gang was promptly dispersed . At the close of the meeting , a mother approached the teacher . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics ? " she demanded . " That 's just what it is ! " said the teacher . " Well , well ! And I always thought politics meant me old man getting full when he voted for the President av the United States ! " Bringing the Problems Home Perhaps , in her next primer lesson , the teacher will take up the case of those same young toughs , showing that something might be said in their behalf . A gymnasium or a boxing-club may be the means of saving their immature , adolescent natures from running to waste . Possibly it is the fault of the half-time schools which afford opportunity for mischief to eager and idle young brains . Or perhaps the teacher of elementary politics may take for the text of her primer lesson the cases of typhoid , arising from impure milk or water supplies , which have carried off some of the children of the neighborhood . Or she may point out how bad roads keep young people isolated , away from the school and the normal pleasures of youth , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the boys run away from home . ' But , women ask , is the regulation of such simple things politics ? It is the very quintessence of practical politics . It is politics in the egg . And when women have learned I these first primer lessons ? lessons which concern themselves , not with presidential eke- I tions and interallied conferences , but such plain , humdrum subjects as clean streets , good schools , pure milk and water supplies , decent environment , and respectable pleasures for the young ? and when they have put into practical demonstration these primer lessons in their own home communities ? then they may begin to think of graduating into a higher class . But for the next decade , at least . they will do well to stick closely to these fundamental abc 's . And after they have builded conscience and character into the political fabric of their own home community , they may begin to reach out to the wider vision of the nation ? which is , after all , only the home community writ large . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
