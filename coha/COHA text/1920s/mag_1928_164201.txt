Citizens of Birmingham , Ala. , held a meeting some evenings ago to discuss politics . The discussion was opened by dragging in an effigy of Nominee Smith . " What shall we do with him ? " cried the presiding officer . <P> " Lynch him ! " yelled the citizens . <P> A man with a knife fell upon the dummy 's throat and gashed it open . He then splattered a red fluid ( mercurochrome ) around the wound . The Birming-hamians howled for joy . Some fired revolver shots into the " corpse . " Others kicked it , spit at it . Others got a rope , noosed it , dragged it around the hall for a hanging . <P> That , of course , was a Ku Klux Klan demonstration as well as a Southern demonstration . Nevertheless , its sheer , insensate violence made people wonder how serious was the likelihood of many Southern Democrats splitting away from their Northern brethren over Nominee Smith this autumn . <P> A fortnight ago reports and opinions conflicted . Nominee Robinson warned his party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ticket in the South . An anti-Smith caucus was called among Texas Democrats . A " scratch Smith " movement was reported among North Carolina Democrats . To combat this sort of thing , regular Democrats threatened to keep " bolter books " and expel from the party any Democrat who abandoned the nominees . <P> <P> Nominee Smith 's reply to his colleague 's warning was a decision to let well enough alone and not have any Southern campaign headquarters . To do otherwise , he thought , would be to admit and thus foster uncertainty about the South . Following this news , National Committeeman John S. Cohen of Georgia was reported to have laid aside his anti-Smith sentiments . And from North Carolina came word that the last really potent political boss against Smith-Senator Furnifold M. Simons-was going to " stand hitched " and perhaps even draw his weight . <P> Such was the state of affairs when Senator Fess of Ohio , a most optimistic Republican , said : " Governor Smith will undoubtedly carry the Solid South . We have a fighting chance in North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning the electoral vote of any other Southern State . " <P> But the largest-looming effort to split the South was yet to come , and did come , last week at Asheville , -N . C.-the " nonclerical " Dry conference called by Bishop James Cannon Jr . of the Methodist Episcopal Church , South , and Dr. Arthur J. Barton . Georgia Baptist . <P> Bishop Cannon is a quiet , prosy , tenacious little Virginian , a son of the W. C. T. U. His name is a synonym for the militant , reforming , social-working element of the Methodist-Episcopal Church , South . He has long sought to reunite the northern and southern wings of his faith , which split over slavery in 1844 . His lifelong ardor for Prohibition is explained , in his own words , as follows :
