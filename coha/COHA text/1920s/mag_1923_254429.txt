The Best Books The following estimates of books most in the public eye were made after careful consideration of the trend of critical opinion : <P> THE WORLD IN FALSEFACE - George Jean Nathan - Knopf . Mr. Nathan is a conscientious professional iconoclast . He continues to knock down his favorite idols and to scatter the ruins . His victims range from the more eminent of modern dramatists to the more generally accepted of modern doctrines . His endorsements are few . They include Hauptmann , Flo Ziegfeld , Eugene O'Neill , the younger Guitry , George M. Cohan . <P> PERADVENTURE - Robert Kerble - Putnam . Our hero starts for the church , but gets lost on the way in the thickets of theology . After an interminable succession of spiritual mishaps , he ends up satisfactorily enough in the arms of a woman and in the pleasant meadows of her paganism . On the way he is so busy wondering about the meaning of life that he can give very little time to living it . <P> CHALLENGE - V. Sackville-West- Doran . Whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The drama of Eve , whose passion is masked by her frivolity ; of Julian , her cousin , whose cause she betrays for love of him ; of Kato , middle-aged and stalwart woman who dominates him , is played against a glowing kaleidoscope of political intrigue in the Greek islands . <P> His CHILDREN 'S CHILDREN - Arthur Train-Scribner 's . Old Peter Kayne was a Wall Street pirate . His son Rufus acquired a social veneer over his inadequacies . The third generation consists of three daughters , each of whom meets catastrophe . The last thing to fall is the Kayne fortune . Whatever the accuracy of its depressing picture of modern society , the novel is interesting and often extremely penetrating . <P> MYSTERY AT GENEVA-Rose Macauley-Boni . Twenty years from now the League of Nations assembles , at Geneva . A plot for kidnapping the delegates one by one is conceived by a group of assorted super-criminals . The reason for their dislike of the League is obscure , in as much as it is depicted as a majestically futile assemblage . The story brandishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satire . Both are equally keen , and the result is a complete conquest of the reader . <P> HOMELY LILLA - Robert Herrick- Harcourt . Lilla is even more stupid than homely . As she grows up she gradually discovers that , despite her plainness , she has a considerable power over men . She marries an amiable school principal , is completely unhappy with him in a dull , acquiescing sort of way , and then leaves him . She finally finds a degree of happiness with another man . The book is a painstaking and outspoken examination of her problems .
