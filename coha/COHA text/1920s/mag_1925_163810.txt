Two Irishmen negotiated a difficult compromise with that amiably typical John Bull , Premier Stanley <P> Baldwin . The two Irishmen were Sir James Craig , Premier of Ulster , * and President Cosgrave of the Irish Free State. + <P> The compromise which they at length agreed upon concerned the much contested frontier between Ulster and the Irish Free State- between industrial Protestant Northern Ireland and agrarian Catholic Southern Ireland . For many months the Irish Boundary Commission , created under Article XII of the Treaty of 1921 between Great Britain and the Irish Free State , has been attempting to decide how this vital if imaginary line could be drawn " in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants , so far as may be compatible with economic and geographic conditions . " The plain truth of the matter proved to be that " the wishes of the inhabitants , " so blandly referred to by the Treaty , were apt to lead straight to civil war . If the boundary were changed , " Ulster will not yield an inch ! " Equally there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since " the Free State will never rest until the Catholic provinces of Ulster are on true Irish soil ! " <P> With the nationals of both districts so inflammably minded , the labors of the Commission in trying to take account of the many quirks in the frontier which are economically and geographically irksome , ** proved vain . One of the three Commissioners resigned , and it was feared last week that if the other two should publish their report- any kind of report-Ulsterites and Free Staters might begin the age-old game which is now played with rifles instead of blackthorn sticks . <P> In these circumstances Premier Craig and President Cosgrave met with Premier Baldwin and decided that , since nobody dared to touch the frontier , the only thing left was a settlement in cash . To them Article V of the Treaty of 1921 seemed to offer a chance for such a settlement . It provided that another Commission ( never convoked ) should at some date decide how much of Britain 's War debt the Irish should pay . Since the Irish Free State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no payments would ever be made . Why not release the Free State from this " impracticable obligation " on condition that Free Staters cease to demand that part of Ulster be ceded to them ? <P> Shorn of legal verbiage the agreement signed by the Englishman and the two Irishmen* last week amounts to exactly the compromise stated . Articles V and XII of the Treaty of 1921 are to be scrapped , the boundary is to stay where it is , and the Free State is to be released from its obligation to pay part of Britain 's War debt , pensions , etc. , while agreeing to compensate victims of the active fighting in Ireland which immediately preceded the present status quo . As a final touch , the abortive Irish Council , which has never met , was scrapped , and its never exercised powers , so far as they affect Ulster , transferred to the Ulster Government .
