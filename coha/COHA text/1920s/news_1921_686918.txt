txt SANTO DOMINGO 'S FREEDOM . To the Editor of The New York Times : Your correspondent A. Pereira , in Sunday 's TrmEs , states : " I ' read in the newspapers of this country criticism on the American occupation of Santo Domingo on the ground that this constitutes a violation of the sovereign rights of a small sister republic . " After saying that politics is controlled in Santo Domingo by a ring of politicians who elect as President one of their own number ( a condition not unknown in these United States ) , he announces that " the inhabitants of Santo Domingo are a kindhearted , good people who-love peace and good order , and they heartily appreve the American occupation there . " " Let the American Marines stay in Santo Domingo until they break up the ring of politicians . " Evidently Mr. Pereira did not know that 15,000 persons , led by the venerable Archbishop Noueliall the ' members of the Supreme Court of Santo Domingo and the Faculties of all the universities , assembled in an indignant demonstration in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal : of the forces of occupation . The Aenneated Press reports that one of the grounds of their protest was the loan of $2,500,000 , netting as ' high as 10 per cent . interest , floated in this country in opposition to the wishes of Santo Domingo . Another ground of protest . by these Dominicans who , Mr. Pereira sayn , " heartily approved of the occupation , " was the demand that they ratify unconditionally all khe acts of the occupation , many of which they termed , incompetence , graft , murder , arson and pillage . This does not breathe a spirit of deep content on the part of these representative Dominicans . Will Mr. Pereira tell us what the marines are doing to " break up the ring of politicians , " and where , and how ? Granted that Santo Domingo was an independent , self-governing nation , what right had we to attempt to govern it according to our ideas of self-government ? H. C. HILL . New York , Aug. 31 , 1921 . MISSOURI COMPROMISE To the Editor of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centennial - of the Missouri Compromise is valuable to every teacher of American history in our schools . Every teacher of . United States history manages to impress the Missouri Compromise upon her pupils and the article is a valuable horizon-widening aid ; so , I doubt not , it will be clipped and added to the notes , of many city teachers . I regret that the ' writer accuses Napoleon of being " a bad . prophet " in the prediction he made ; for our navy . in the War of 1812 , which some would mistakenly strike out of our school text-books , verified his prediction . Napoleon never dreamed that dire necessity would ally - France and Great Britain in a ? that exactly parallels the Napoleonic struggle . for ' , domination of Europe , Africa and Asia Minor . H. G. SCHNEIDER. , Murray Isle , N. Y. , Aug. 11 , 19214 ' Cheaper in the Long Run to Pay Them Direct to the , Government . To the Editor of The New York Times : A plan of taxation published in one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the increased reduction allowed individuals of small incomes . If we take this $70,000,000 off one class and tack it on the wealthier class , is it not at least probable that they will add that sum to the price of their commodities , whether they be merchandise , loans , professional services or whatever source from which their profits are derived ? And is n't it usually the custom , perhaps rightly so , to add a little bit more for the trouble and risk ? Therefore it seems to me that the $70,000,000 reduction , distributed as it will be among several millions of buyers , would be not only an apparent relief but rather an added burden . Now , from a psychological viewpoint , would it not be better'to reduce the exemptions to half the amount , so that every man and many women would have to pay acdirect tax , small though it might be ? We are afraid of taxes . Our statesmen and politicians approach the-'tax question with fear and trembling . Why ? Because in most cases they are afraid to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a trait of human nature to kick when the tax bill comes in or when we pay an income tax . Kicks are unpleasant things , and fewer will be heard if fewer are taxed . Hence the effort to let the average rna.n down easy . But the average man must pay those taxes just the same , although in another form of increased profits , to some one else . Then he will kick because prices are high , because big business is getting more than its share , because he has to pay 8 per cent , for loans instead of 6 per cent . That . will divert the attention of the minds of the public from Government to big business . But is that plan wise ? Only the thoughtless can believe that millions of citizens with incomes up to , say , $3,500 , can be entirely exempt from a direct tax unless they " pay the fiddler " in some other way , and only a little thought should convince them that the cheapest way to pay their share would be direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baker and candlestick maker " to usurp Uncle Sam 's duties . H. W. BROWN . Saugerties , N. Y. , Sept. 2 , ; 1921 . CRUSADE FOR WOMEN . To the Editor of The New York Times : A letter in THE SUNDAY TIMES for Aug. 21 , speaking on the League of Nations , asks : " What do the women think of it ? " And adds : " Here is a wond8rful opportunity for them to prove the wisdom of making them voters . " Will THE TIMES kindly grant me space to answer for myself ? I have believed in the League of Nations from the first . I have talked for it , ' written for it , hoped for it . I was shocked when the United States , through the bad behavior of the Senate , failed to sign the treaty  --  shocked , then grieved , then ashamed . That men chosen for such high duty as that devolving upon Senators could be ruled by party spirit at such a moment , the supreme moment in the history of man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity prayed for and long foretold , by refusing to sign that now immortal document , was indeed matter for grief and shame . But the League of Nations is now at work attending to the world 's business , and has some serious problems before it . I am reading Sarah Wambaugh 's articles in THE TIMES with the deepest interest , and my faith is equal to my interest . If women were fully awake to their duty they would be crusading against big navies and standing armies as once they crusaded against the saloons . If they realized their power there would be no more money wasted on munitions of war , and the $6,000,000 just gone up in the smoke of the ZR-2 would now be available for use by disabled soldiers . EMILY BURTON , Palacios , Texas , Aug. 31. 1921 . LONG-LOST LETTERS . To the Editor of The New York Tunes : In today 's issue of your paper I read with rhuch amusement your account of the journoyings of a letter , addressed " S. I. , " to the Solomon Islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sent a letter to my home town , Patchogue , and appended the innocent " L : I. , " meaning , of course , Long Island , as well as New York . To my utter amazement it traveled to Luzon Island , one of the Philippine group , before it finally reached its destination . There had been quite a little in the press at the time about the Island of Luzon , so I attributed the psychology to that association of ideas . ? My message had a world ttour for 2 cents . Now that the atmosphere of the Post Office Department is less dense , more Haysy , so to speak , these things may not occur so frequently . MRS . L. L. EBSEN . Wilkes-Barre , Pa. , Sept. 1 , 1521 . A LEAGUE SHOCK . To the Editor of The New York Times : If George Harvey is as intellectually penetrating as he is superficially bright , the irony of facts connected with the League of Nations hurled at him , at the Paris conference , when England , France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silesian difficulty to the League , should have bowled him completely out . It must have been with many inward , gleeful chuckles that the grave Ambassadors contemplated the hole into which their vote had hurled Harvey , Borah , Johnson , President Harding , et al. , who for the last two years have shouted . " The League is dead . " THOMAS B. PAYNE . Brooklyn , Conn. , Sept. 1 , 1921.
