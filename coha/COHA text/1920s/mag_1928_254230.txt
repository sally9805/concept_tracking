Up the tall hill on which perches the citadel of Prague sped the sleek limousine of Lewis Einstein . When Commoner William Jennings Bryan was U.S. Secretary of State , he once called Mr. Einstein an " invaluable adjunct " to that Department . Lion Hunter Theodore Roosevelt declared in 1918 , " Mr. Lewis Einstein . . . foresaw the War . He foresaw our entry into the War . " <P> Last week the sleek limousine of Lewis Einstein , rich and smart " career diplomat , " and U.S. Minister to Czechoslovakia , was accorded every mark of respect as it wheeled into the courtyard of the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry . Alighting briskly suave Mr. Einstein stepped within and soon deposited a formal demand from the U.S. State Department that the annual quota set upon U. S. motor cars imported into Czechoslovakia shall be raised this year by a cool 1,000 . <P> Naturally U.S. motor men are vexed by the motor quota system , just as are Czechoslovaks by the U.S. immigration quota . But the need of developing a Czechoslovak motor industry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the Allied countries which secured independence for Czechoslovakia after the War . However , the " demand " presented by Minister Einstein , last week , was courteous and purely formal . Negotiations have long been smoothly under way to raise the U.S. motor quota to an annual total of 30% of present Czechoslovak production . <P> As the Einstein limousine purred down Prague 's hill , many a non-Semite looked with envious eye . Well known is the fact that the U.S. Minister 's rich father ( wool ) cut him off with $125,000 when he married his present spouse , because she had been twice before a wife . But later a rich sister placed at Son Einstein 's disposal for life an income of $20,000 per year . In the opinion of William Jennings Bryan the present Mrs. Einstein became a distinct adornment to the diplomatic personnel , and deserved all praise for remaining in Constantinople with her husband through the entire Turkish Revolution of 1908 , at which time he was successively Second Secretary , First Secretary and Charge d'Affairs.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
