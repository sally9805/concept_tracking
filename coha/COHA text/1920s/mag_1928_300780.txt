At Evanston , Ill. , last week , the American Chemical Society Institute continued its expositions of chemistry 's newest discoveries and applications . <P> Wherefore . " Chemistry is a philosophy working in man 's mind , leading him to search for fundamental truth and in the end to power in world . affairs . Science knows no frontiers . " - Sir James C. Irvine , acting chancellor of St. Andrews University , Scotland . <P> Motor Gasoline . Dr. Gustave Egloff , research director of Universal Oil Products Co. of Chicago , declared that motorists could save 3,000,000,000 gallons of gasoline and this year $400,000,000 if motor vehicle makers made their motors for higher compression . <P> Idiosyncrasies . From an island in New York Harbor where the city 's refuse is burnt , a smoky stench pervades the neighborhood . It bothers some people of the city . They sicken peculiarly because , health officials have just declared , the proteins in the smoke are poisonous to them . Other communities whose refuse is burned , unwittingly suffer in a like manner . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke , just as other people are sickened by strawberries , bananas or tomatoes , by plant pollens , by cocain or morphine . Just why , scientists have not yet learned . It is impossible to measure the poison liberated by the various irritants . But by combining the technique of pharmacology , immunology and bacteriology and working from a chemical viewpoint , slow progress to discovery is being made , said former Dean Arthur I. Kendall of Northwestern University Medical School . Serums are proving useful . <P> Minerals for Diabetics . Analyzing insulin , whose active principle has not yet been isolated , * chemists find minute traces of cobalt and nickel , so some diabetics are now being experimentally fed with cobalt and nickel salts . Scientists coupled this observation with the known fact that soil qualities modify the characteristics of peoples through the plant life eaten directly or indirectly ( through herbivorous animals ) . Example : In Switzerland where iodine is rare , goitre is common . Feeblemindedness and dwarfism are therefore frequent . The recommendation of Dean Jacob G. Lipman of the Rutgers College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what proper elements their soil lacks and intelligently supply the deficiency in fertilizers . <P> * Of the hormones known to be secreted by the ductless glands thyroxin from the thyroid and epinephrin from the suprarenal have been reduced to purity .
