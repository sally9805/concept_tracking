An humble , not to say abject apology was made , last week , by Prime Minister General Baron Giichi Tanaka to the Sublime Emperor , Hirohito , whom Japanese honor as the lineal descendant of the Sun Goddess . <P> The Prime Minister 's fault was that he had kept His Majesty insufficiently informed of certain complex political developments which finally resulted , last week , in the resignation of Minister of Education Dr. Rentaro Mizumo . The affair was so ineptly bungled as to allow it to seem for a time that Emperor Hirohito had desired Dr. Mizumo to continue in office . <P> So appalling and calamitous was this accidental tarring of the Divine Emperor with an earthy , political brush that last week members of the House of Peers seriously conferred as to whether they should banish from their ranks Penitent Baron Tanaka.
