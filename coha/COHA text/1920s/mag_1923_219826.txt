Mr. Secretary Hughes has finally sent to Mexico City two competent lawyers to arrange for the " recognition " of the Obregon Government . <P> For it is now chiefly a legal question which must be settled before American recognition is accorded : By Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution , the Mexican government was given all the subsoil of Mexico , including oil , minerals , etc . This was manifestly unfair to foreigners who had previously acquired rights to subsoil properties . Obregon has said that he would recognize these rights obtained by American investors before the Constitution went into effect . But Secretary Hughes does not trust his word . He wants the promise written down- preferably into a " treaty of commerce and amity . " <P> This Article 27 , together with Article 33 , has been the basis of the new freedom of Mexico because it has given the land back to Mexicans . Hitherto , Obregon has been unable to yield on it for fear of being accused of " selling out to America . " <P> Obregon , as has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet assure the people he is n't doing so . " His position is now so strong that it seems certain the Mexican people will accept whatever arrangement he makes with America . And the American commissioners , John Barton Payne and Charles B. Warren , are likely to meet Obregon half way .
