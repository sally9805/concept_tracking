Newark , N.J.'s. airport , built to be the great western terminal of transcontinental air lines opened last week . To land there are the Manhattan-bound mail planes from Philadelphia , Washington , Atlanta , Cleveland , Chicago , Boston , Montreal . The port has two 700-ft. runways each a half mile long , a postoffice building , radio station , meteorological station besides the usual hangars , administration buildings and machine shop . Eventually an elevated highway without crossings will be constructed towards New York Harbor so that plane mail can be rushed into the city in 33 minutes . The lag now is nearly an hour . <P> Portland , Me . In a biting wind through clouds that threatened snow , 50 military and commercial flyers raced and stunted near Portland , Me. , last week to commemorate the opening of its airport at Scarboro . It is the first port in a chain of 25 that the Curtiss Flying Service will operate in the East .                  @ @ @
