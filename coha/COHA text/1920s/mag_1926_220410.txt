Maimed German War veterans exhibiting their stumps , shouting " We fought ! You vote ! " were motored by Communists and Socialists about German cities last week in an effort to rouse sluggish citizens for the great Referendum ( TIME , June 21 et ante ) held to deprive Wilhelm II and the erstwhile German nobility without compensation of property valued at five billion gold marks previously seized by the Reich . <P> " Referendum Sunday " dawned warm , blue-skied , inviting . Millions of Germans went a picnicking , neglected to ballot . A drenching afternoon rain fell alike upon the picnickers and the snug houses of several million more Germans who refused to venture out-even jeered the War veterans riding in open motors through the rain . <P> Sixty per cent of the electorate abstained from voting . Thirty-five per cent ( 14,889,703 ) voted for " confiscation without compensation . " That was not enough . Twenty million votes were required by law to sustain the plebiscite . Five per cent of the voters ( 542,311 ) strode to the polls and gratuitously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their votes had no immediate bearing upon the referendum . <P> Once again Wilhelm II quaffed the mead of a triumph presented to his lips by Fate or Chance . It is scarcely realized today through what extraordinary vicissitudes he has passed . " The Supreme War Criminal " ( 1918 ) - Mr . Lloyd George haying actually won an election with the slogan " Hang the Kaiser ! " : " Wilhelm of Doom " ( 1926 ) - Herr Hohenzollern having already received from the Reich a sum equivalent to $1,000 for every day since his abdication. * <P> How It Happened .

" The Feldmarschall declared : " Your Majesty , that must be said which I can not , as a loyal Prussian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ludendorff ) responded to a curt inquiring nod from the Kaiser : " Sire , the Army will march home in peace and order under its own generals , but not under the command of your Majesty . " <P> " Excellency , " rapped the Kaiser stiffening , " I demand from my generals in writing a statement that the army is no longer under the command of its Supreme War Lord . . . . " <P> Adjutant telegraphers and telephonists interrupted momentarily the Kaiser 's audience with his generals . The Imperial Chancellor , Prince Max of Baden was telephoning from Berlin . Local revolutions , prepared throughout Germany by the Independent Socialists had broken out at Kiel ( Nov. 6 ) , Hamburg , Cologne , Munich , Magdeburg , Dresden . ... At Berlin a tide of civilian workers and mutinous soldiers was milling through the streets . Prince Max demanded that the Kaiser abdicate . The populace , he declared , had been convinced by Allied propaganda that the Allies would never make peace with a Hohenzollern , would trample across Germany to Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
