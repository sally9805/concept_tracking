" **25;10659;TOOLONG . " <P> Milton Wright , Associate Editor of the Scientific American , was reading aloud : <P> " Eureka , " " Mizpah , " " Mother Machree , " " Jim , old boy , I am here . " <P> A little group , assembled in the offices of his magazine in the Woolworth Building , Manhattan , stirred uneasily . Each phrase read by Editor Wright came from one of 284 epistles which were being expertly opened by Publisher Orson D. Munn . <P> " Watermelon , " " Welencei Boldosag , " " Amen , " " A peacock feather . " <P> Everybody in the room realized the significance of those words , for they knew the story of an agreement which a certain Dr. J. Allen Gilbert of Portland , Ore. , had made with his wife just before she died eight years ago . Both had been interested in spiritualism . While the woman lay ill they made a pact that if she died she would try to communicate with him through a medium . To defeat fakery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sealed it in an envelope . It consisted of the date of Dr. Gilbert 's birth , of his wife 's , of their daughter 's . <P> Mrs. Gilbert died . The Doctor offered a reward of $500 to any medium who could give him a message from her-certified of course by the countersign . First 139 mediums tried for the money , but to none of them had the dead Mrs. Gilbert communicated the password . More letters began to come in . Dr. Gilbert asked the co-operation of Editor Wright . The strange abracadabras that the editor read aloud in the hushed room in the Woolworth Building were the attempts of 284 mediums to prove that they had talked to a dead woman . <P> " Pure White Valentine , " " Moonlight Star , " " James , James , I Am So Far Away , " " Gosh Darn , Old Cooty , she 's easy . " <P> Listeners well knew what such phrases meant . They meant that 284 mediums were fakes.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
