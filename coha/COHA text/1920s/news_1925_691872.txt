txt In Montana one man.holds the offices of Warden of the State Penitentiary and Commissioner of Motor Vehicles . This curious fact is cited in an article upon legislation to regulate the use of motor vehicles by HERBERT L. TOWLE in The Review of Reviews . " In , New Jersey , " Connecticut and Massachusetts , which " have the most crowded roads in the " country , the Commissioner , " says Mr. TOWLE , " is a veritable czar , and he needs to be . " The highways in Mon- , tana are not so crowded , but the careless driver must realize that the Commissioner may be his jailer if he falls into the hands of the traffic policeman. , In the forty-eight States there is a tendency toward uniformity of regulation . Motor vehicle officials have acquired the convention habit . To compare notes is to urge the enactment of better laws . Wyoming seems to be the only State that is satisfied to require a " reasonable and proper speed . " Such tClaw is advocated by many who believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their responsibility . In most of the States there is a speed limit of from thirty to thirty-five miles . Kansas al= lows forty miles , and Nevada , which does not boast the best roads in the country , sets the speed limit at fortyfive miles . Connecticut has a minimum speed law : vehicles that can not make twelve miles an hour are not registered . Lower speeds for heavy trucks are enforced in many of the States . Local police regulations differ to such an extent that visiting drivers are often confused , which tends to increase accidents . Stops on overtaking standing trolley cars , except in safety zones in cities , are generally required .

New Hampshire , Vermont , Massachusetts and Connecticut allow to owners living fifteen miles outside the State line a year 's registration for a nominal fee . In headlight laws there is an embarrassing lack of uniformity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road for 200 feet ahead . Lenses or diffusing reflectors are required almost everywhere . California , Oregon arid Texas go into details of candle power . A common rule is that the top of the headlight beams shall not be more than forty-two inches above the ground . New Jersey prohibits the spotlight . Both trucks and passenger cars with tops must carry mirrors in that State . Tourists should be warned that in some of the States cars that are left standing must be locked . To make heavy trucks pay adequately for the damage they do to roads , stiffer license fees are being charged . They are " still further reached by the recent device of the gasoline tax . " In Vermont , Rhode Island and-Delaware heavy trucks may be limited to certain roads . Restrictions on weight of loads are imposed in , an increasing number of States . In California and West Virginia it may prove expensive to disregard the law in this respect , for weighing patrols are out to insist that excess weight be unloaded at the owner 's risk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as common carriers . In many of these States such vehicles must have a certificate from the Public Seryice Commission or a similar body . Owners are bonded for , insurance against accident . More and more are owners who
