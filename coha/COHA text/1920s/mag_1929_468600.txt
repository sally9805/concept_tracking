IT IS out of fashion in these days to look backward rather than forward ; and about the only American given commonly to this disgraceful conduct is some unreconstructed Southerner , who persists in his regard for a certain ter ? rain , a certain history , and a certain in ? herited way of living . He is punished as his crime deserves . He feels himself in the American scene as an anachronism , and knows he is felt by his neighbors as a reproach . Fortunately , he is a tolerably harmless reproach . He is like some quaint local character of eccentric but fixed principles who is thoroughly and almost pridefully accepted by the village as a rare exhibit of the antique kind . His position is se ? cure from the interference of the police , but it is of a rather ambiguous dignity . I could wish that he were not so en ? tirely taken for granted , and that as a reproach he might bear a barb and inflict a sting . His fierce devotion is to a lost cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure it is lost . They are so far from fearing him and his example that they even in the excess of confidence offer him a little honor , a little petting . As a Southerner , I have observed this in ? dulgence , and I try to be grateful . Ob ? viously , it does not constitute a danger to the Republic ; distinctly , it is not treasonable . They are good enough to attribute a sort of glamour to Southern life as it is defined for them in the popu ? lar tradition . They like to use the South as the nearest available locus for the scenes of their sentimental songs , and sometimes they send their daughters tothe Southern seminaries . Not too much is to be made , of course , of this last graceful gesture . For they do not ex ? pose to this hazard their sons , who in our still very masculine order will have to discharge the functions of citizenship , and who must accordingly be sternly ed ? ucated in the principles of progress at progressive institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much differ ? ence what principles of a general charac ? ter the young women acquire , since they are not likely to be impaired by princi ? ples in their peculiar functions , such as virtue and the domestic duties . And so , at suitable seasons , and on the main-line trains , one may see them in some num ? bers , flying south or flying north like migratory birds ; and one may wonder to what extent their philosophy of life will be affected by two or three years in the South . One must remember that prob ? ably their parents have already made this calculation and are prepared to answer , Not much . The Southerner must know and , in fact , he does very well know , that his antique conservatism does not exert a large influence against the American progressivist doctrine . The Southern idea to-day is down , and the progressive or American idea is up . Nevertheless , the historian and the philosopher , who take views that are thought to be re ? spectively longer and deeper than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Southern idea rather than the American has in its favor the authority of example and the approval of theory . And some prophet may even find it pos ? sible to expect that it may yet rise again . I will propose a thesis which seems to have about as much cogency as general ? izations usually have : The South is unique on this continent for having founded and defended a culture which was according to the European princi ? ples of culture ; and the European prin ? ciples had better look to the South if they are to be perpetuated in this country . II The nearest of the European cultures which we could examine is that of Eng ? land ; and this is of course the right one in the case , quite aside from our conven ? knee . England was actually the model employed by the South , in so far as South ? ern culture was not quite indigenous . And there is in the South even to-day an Anglophile sentiment quite anomalous in the American scene . England differs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notably in the fact that England did her pioneer ? ing an indefinite number of centuries ago , did it well enough , and has been living pretty tranquilly on her establishment ever since , with infrequent upheavals and replacements . The customs and institutions of England seem to the American observer very fixed and an ? cient . There is no doubt that the Eng ? lish tradition expresses itself in many more or less intangible ways , but it ex ? presses itself most importantly in a ma ? terial establishment ; and by this I mean the stable economic system by which Englishmen are content to take their livelihood from the physical environ ? ment . The chief concern of England 's half-mythical pioneers , as with pioneers anywhere , was with finding the way to make a living . Evidently they found it . But fortunately the methods they worked out proved transmissible , proved , in fact , the main reliance of the succeed ? ing generations . The pioneers explored the soil , determined what concessions it might reasonably be expected to make them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived bypainful experiment at a thousand satis ? factory recipes by which they might secure their material necessities . Their descendants have had the good sense to consider that this establishment was good enough for them . They have elected to live their comparatively easy and routine lives in accordance with the tradition which they inherited , and they have consequently enjoyed a leisure , a security , and an intellectual freedom that were never the portion of pioneers . The pioneering life is not the normal life , whatever some Americans may sup ? pose . It is not , if we look for the mean ? ing of European history . The lesson of each of the European cultures now ex ? tant is in this ? that European opinion does not make too much of the intense practical enterprises , but is at pains to define rather narrowly the practical effort which is prerequisite to the re ? flective and m.sthetic life . Boys are very well pleased to employ their mus ? cles almost exclusively , but men prefer to exercise their minds . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of least resistance , in order to put the surplus of energy into the free life of the mind . Thus is en ? gendered that famous , or infamous , European conservatism , which will ap ? pear stupid , necessarily , to men still fascinated by materialistic projects , men in a state of arrested adolescence ; for instance , to some very large if in ? definite fraction of the population of these United States . Perhaps England is being " quick ? ened " or Americanized ; then , taut pis ! I have in mind here the core of unadul ? terated Europeanism , with its self-suffi ? cient , backward-looking , intensely pro ? vincial communities . The human life of English provinces long ago came to terms with nature , fixed its roots some ? where in the spaces between the rocks and in the shade of the trees , founded its comfortable institutions , secured its modest prosperity ? and then willed the whole in perpetuity to the generations which should come after , in the ingenu ous confidence that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the character of a seasoned pro ? vincial life that it is realistic , or success ? fully adapted to its natural environment , and that as a consequence it is stable , or hereditable . But it is the character of our urbanized , anti-provincial , progres ? sive , and mobile American life that it is in a condition of eternal flux . Affections , and long memories , attach to the ancient bowers of life in the provinces ; but they can not attach to what is always chang ? ing . Americans , however , are somewhat averse to such affections for natural objects and to such memories . Now memories of the past are at ? tended with a certain pain called nostal ? gia . It is hardly a technical term in our sociology , or our psychiatry , but it might well be . Nostalgia is a kind of growing-pain , psychically speaking . It occurs to our sorrow when we have de ? cided that it is time for us , marching to some magnificent destiny , to abandon an old home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living to which we had become habituated . It is the complaint of hu ? man nature in its vegetative aspect , when it is plucked up by the roots from the place of its origin and transplanted in foreign soil , or even left dangling in the air . And it must be in fact nothing else but nostalgia , the instinctive ob ? jection to transplantation , that chiefly prevents the deracination of human communities and their complete geo ? graphical dispersion as the casualties of an insatiable wanderlust . Deraeination in our Western life is the strange discipline which individuals turn upon themselves , enticed by the blandish ? ments of those fine words , Progressive , Liberal , and Forward . The progressiv ? ist says in effect : Do not allow yourself to feel homesick ; form no such powerful at ? tachments that you will feel a pain in cutting them loose ; prepare your spirit to be ever on the move . According to this gospel , there is no rest for the weary , not even in Heaven . Did not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment he entered into his re ? ward , to " fight onward , there as here " ? And the progressivist H. G. Wells has outlined very neatly his scheme of prog ? ress , the only disheartening feature be ? ing that he has had to revise it a good many times , and that he has produced for the period required to carry it out a variety of estimates , from hundreds to millions of years . Browning and Wells would have made very good Americans , and I am sure they have got the most of their disciples on this side of the Atlan ? tic ; they have not been very good Euro ? peans . Actually , if perhaps uncon ? sciously , the true progressivist intends to have a program so elastic that he can al ? ways propose new worlds to conquer . For if his utopia were practicable really , and if he should secure it , he would then have to defend it , which would mean his transformation from a progres ? sivist into a conservative . And this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? velopment , which does not reflect great credit on the supposed capacity of our species for formulating its own behavior . Evidently the formula may involve its practitioners just as readily in self-tor ? ture and suicide as in the enjoyment of life . In most human societies man has adapted himself to environment with plenty of intelligence to secure easily his material necessities from the graceful bounty of nature . And then , ordinarily , he concludes a truce with nature , and he and nature seem to live on terms of mu ? tual respect and amity , and his loving arts , religious , and philosophies comes spontaneously into being ; these are the blessings of peace . But the latter-day societies have been seized none quite so violently as our American one ? with the strange idea that the human destiny is not to secure an honorable peace with nature , but to wage an unrelenting war on nature . Men , therefore , determine to conquer nature to a degree which is quite beyond reason so far as any specific human advantage is concerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man is boastfully declared to be a natural scientist essentially , whose strength is capable of crushing and mak ? ing over to his own desires the brute ma ? teriality which is nature ; but in his in ? finite contention with this materiality he is really capitulating to it . His engines transform the face of nature ? a little ? but when they have been perfected , he must invent new engines that will per ? form even more heroically . And always the next engine of his invention , even though it be that promised engine which is to invade the material atom and ex ? ploit the most secret treasury of nature 's wealth , will be a physical engine ; and the man who uses it will be engaged in sub ? stantially the same struggle as was the primitive Man with the Hoe . This is simply to say that Progress never defines its ultimate objective , but thrusts its victims at once into an infinite series . Our vast industrial machine , with its laboratory centers of experi ? mentation , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state which is organized strictly for war and can never consent to peace . Or , re ? turning to the original figure , our pro ? gressivists are the latest version of those pioneers who conquered the wilderness , except that they are pioneering on prin ? ciple , or from force of habit , and without any recollection of what pioneering was for . The Southern states were settled of course by miscellaneous strains . But evidently the one which determined the peculiar tradition of the South was the one which came out of Europe most con ? vinced of the virtues of establishment , contrasting with those strains which seem for the most part to have domi ? nated the other sections , and which came out of Europe feeling rebellious towards all establishments . There are a good many faults to be found with the old South , but hardly the fault of being in ? temperately addicted to work and to gross material prosperity . The Southnever conceded that the whole duty of man was to increase material production , or that the index to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his material pro ? duction . His business seemed to he rather to envelop both his work and his play with a leisure which permitted the activity of intelligence . On this as ? sumption the South pioneered her way to a sufficiently comfortable and rural sort of establishment , considered that an es ? tablishment was something stable , and proceeded to enjoy the fruits thereof . The arts of the section , such as they were , were not immensely passionate , creative , and romantic ; they were the Eighteenth Century social arts of dress , conversation , manners , the table , the hunt , politics , oratory , the pulpit . These were arts of living and not arts of escape ; they were also community arts , in which every class of society could participate after its kind . The South took life easy , which is itself a tolerably comprehensive art . But so did other communities in 1850 , I believe . And doubtless some others do so yet ; in parts of New England , for example . If there are such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are settled . Their citizens are compara ? tively satisfied with the life they have in ? herited , and are careful to look haekss and quite as much as they look forward . Before the Civil War there must have been many such communities this side of the frontier . The difference between the North and the South was that the South was constituted by such communi ? ties and made solid . But solid is only a comparative term here . The South as a culture had more solidity than another section , but there were plenty of gaps in it . The most we can say is that the Southern establishment was completed in a good many of the Southern com ? munities , and that this establishment was an active formative influence on the spaces between , and on the fron ? tier spaces outlying , which had not yet perfected their organization of the economic life . The old Southern life was of course not nearly so fine as some of the traditional ? ists like to believe . It did not offer serious competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the grandeur that was Horne . It hardly began to match the finish of the English , or any other important Euro ? pean civilization . It is quite enough to say that it was a way of life which had been considered and authorized . The establishment had a sufficient economic base , it was meant to be stable rather than provisional , it had got beyond the pioneering stage , it provided leisure , and its benefits were already being enjoyed . It may as well be admitted that South ? ern society was not an institution of very showy elegance , for the so-called aristo ? crats were mostly home-made and coun ? trified . Aristocracy is not a word which defines this social organization so well as squirearchy , which I borrow from a re ? cent article by Mr. William Frierson in the Sewanee Review . And even the squires , and the other classes too , did not define themselves very strictly . They were loosely graduated social orders , not so fixed as in Europe . Their relations were personal and friendly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for it was a failure if it can not be said that peo ? ple for the most part were in their right places . Slavery was a feature mon ? strous enough in theory but , more often than not , humane in practice ; and it is impossible to believe that its abolition alone could have effected any great revo ? lution in society . The fullness of life as it was lived in the ante-bellum South by the different social orders can be estimated to-day only by the application of some difficult sociolog ? ical technic . It is my thesis that all were committed to a form of leisure , and that their labor itself was leisurely . The only Southerners who went abroad to Washington , and elsewhere , and put themselves into the record , were those from the top of the pyramid . They held their own with their American con ? temporaries . They were not intellec ? tually as seasoned as good Europeans , but then the Southern culture had had no very long time to grow , as time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better fruit eventually . They had a certain amount of learning , which was not as formidable as it might have been ; but at least it was classical and humanistic learning , not highly scientific , and not wildly scat ? tered about over a variety of special studies . It seems important to reflect that the South as a going society would not have countenanced the innovation of an elec ? tive college curriculum . The first aim of such a society is to protect its social con ? cept , and this means the ascendancy in education of that group of studies which has social significance ; they used to be called the humanities , before they were forbidden the use of so proud a term . The admission that one study is as im ? portant as another is a plea in spiritual bankruptcy , and it invites and produces just that ceaseless dissipation of human energies which now defines our intellec ? tual Americanism ? it pictures man as a creature without a center , without a sub ? stantial core of interests , and unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true society there are historical and phil ? osophical principles which compose the staple of an educational requirement , leaving the physical sciences to shift somewhat for themselves . And beyond the learning prescribed for its lay leaders , it is logical for this society to give an educational preference to certain pro ? fessions which are peculiarly committed to its defense . Such professions are the Church , the bar , and the higher teaching profession ; when they lose caste society is in danger . Rut this is somewhat of a digression ; for in 1860 there was not much difference between Northern and Southern ideals of education . Certainly there was less difference between North ? ern and Southern colleges than there was between North and South . The col ? leges tended to be conservative social in ? struments everywhere . Then the North and the South fought , and the consequences were disastrous to both . The Northern temper was one of jubilation and expansiveness , and now it was no longer shackled by the weight of the conservative Southern tradition . Industrialism , the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtook the North , and in due time has now produced our present American civilization . Pov ? erty and pride overtook the South ; pov ? erty to bring her institutions into dis ? repute , and to sap continually at her courage ; and a false pride to inspire a distaste for the thought of fresh pioneer ? ing projects , and to doom her to an in ? creasing physical enfeeblement . It is only too easy to define the malig ? nant meaning of industrialism . It is the contemporary form of pioneering ; yet since it never consents to define its goal , it is a pioneering on principle , and with an accelerating speed . Industrialism is a program under which men , using the latest scientific paraphernalia , sacrifice comfort , leisure , and the enjoyment of life to win Pyrrhic victories from nature at points of no strategic importance . Ruskin and Carlyle feared it nearly a hundred years ago , and now it may be said that their fears have been realized partly in England , and with almost fatal completeness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of false promises and generally fatal to establish ? ments since , when it once gets into them for a little renovation , it proposes never again to leave them in peace . Indus ? trialism is rightfully a menial , of almost miraculous cunning but no intelligence ; it needs to be strongly governed or it will destroy the economy of the household . Only a community of tough conservative habit can master it . The South did not become industrial ? ized ; she did not repair the damage to her old establishment , either , and it was in part because she did not try hard enough . Hers is the case to cite when we would show how the good life de ? pends on an adequate pioneering , and how the pioneering energy must be kept ready for call when the establishment needs overhauling . The Southern tra ? dition came to look rather pitiable in its persistence when the Twentieth Century had arrived , for the establishment was quite depreciated . Unregenerate South ? erners were trying to live the good life on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their effort to make an art out of living when they were not decently making the living . In the country dis ? tricts great numbers of these broken-down Southerners are still to be seen in patched blue-jeans , sitting on ancestral fences , shotgun across their laps and hound-dog at their feet , surveying their unkempt acres while they comment shrewdly on the ways of God . It is their defect that they have driven a too easy , an unmanly bargain with nature , and that their aestheticism is based on in ? sufficient labor . But there is something heroic , and there may prove to be yet something very valuable to the Union , in their ex ? treme attachment to a certain theory of life . They have kept up a faith which was on the point of perishing from this continent . Of course it was only after the Civil War that the North and the South came to stand in polar opposition to each other . Immediately after Appomattox it was impossible for the South to resume even that give-and-take of ideas which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered such terms that acquiescence would have been ab ? ject . She retired within her borders in rage and held the minimum of commerce with the enemy . Persecution intensified her tradition , and made the South more solid and more Southern in the year 1875 , or thereabouts , than ever before . When the oppression was left off , nat ? urally her guard relaxed . But though the period of persecution had not been long , nevertheless the Southern tradi ? tion found itself then the less capable of uniting gracefully with the life of the Union ; for that life in the meantime had been moving on in an opposite direction . The American progressive principle was like a ball rolling down the hill with an increasing momentum ; and by 1890 or 1900 it was clear to any intelligent South ? erner that it was a principle of boundless aggression against nature that could hardly offer much hospitality to a so ? ciety devoted to the arts of peace . But to keep on living shabbily on an insufficient patrimony is to decline , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crisis in the South 's de ? cline has been reached . Industrialism has arrived in the South . Already the local Chambers of Com ? merce exhibit the formidable data of Southern progress . A considerable par ? ty of Southern opinion , which might be called the New South party , is well pleased with the recent industrial accom ? plishments of the section , and eager for many more . Southerners of another school , who might be said to compose an Old South party , are apprehensive lest the section become completely and un ? critically devoted to the industrial ideal precisely as the other and dominant sections of the Union are devoted to it . But reconstruction is actually under way , and it is an industrial reconstruction . Tied politically and economically to the Union , her borders wholly violable , all the South now sees very well that she can restore her prosperity only within the competition of an industrial system . After the war the Southern planta ? tions were often broken up into small farms . These have yielded less and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will never yield a good living until once more they are integrated into large units . But these units will be industrial units , controlled by a board of directors or an executive rather than by a squire , worked with machinery , and manned not by farmers living at home but by " la ? bor . " Even so they will not , according to Mr. Henry Ford , support the popula ? tion that wants to live on them ; in the off-seasons the laborers will have to work in factories , which henceforth are to be counted on as among the charming fea ? tures of Southern landscape . The South ? ern problem is very complicated , but at its center is the farmer 's problem , and this problem is simply the most acute version of that general agrarian problem which inspires the despair of many thoughtful Americans to-day . The agrarian discontent in America is deeply grounded in the love of the tiller for the soil , which is probably , I must confess , not peculiar to the Southern specimen but one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiller as progressive as he may . In proposing to wean men of this foolish attachment , industrialism sets itself against the most ancient and the most humane of all the modes of human livelihood . Do Mr. Hoover and the distinguished thinkers at Washington see how essential is the mutual hatred between the industrialists and the farmers , and how mortal is their conflict ? The gentlemen at Washington are mostly preaching and legislating to secure the fabulous " blessings " of in ? dustrial progress ; they are on the indus ? trial side . But though the industrial ? ists have a doctrine which is monstrous , they themselves are not monsters , but forward-lookers with very nice manners , and no American progressivist is against them . The farmers seem boorish and stubborn by comparison ; American pro ? gressivism is against them in the fight , though their traditional status is still so strong that they are not too flagrantly antagonized . All the solutions recom ? mended for their difficulty are really en ? ticements held out to them to become a little more co-operative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , a little more industrialized . But the farmer who is not a mere laborer , even the farmer of the comparatively new places like Iowa and Nebraska , is necessarily among the more stable and less progressive elements of society . He refuses to mobilize him self and become a unit in the industrial army , because he does not approve of army life . I will use some terms which are hardly in his vernacular . He identifies himself with a spot of ground , and this ground carries a good deal of meaning ; it defines itself for him as nature . He would till it not too hurriedly and not too mechani ? cally to observe in it the contingency and the infinitude of nature ; and so his life acquires its philosophical and even its cosmical consciousness . A man can contemplate and explore , respect and love an object as substantial as a farm or a native province . But he can not con ? template nor explore , respect nor love a mere turnover , such as an assemblage of " natural resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce , a market , or a cred ? it system . It is into precisely these intangibles that industrialism would translate the farmer 's farm . It means the dehumanization of his life . However that may be , the South at last , looking defensively about her in all directions upon an industrial world , fingers the weapons of industrialism . There is one powerful voice in the South which , tired of a long status of disrepute , would see the South made at once into a section second to none in wealth , as that is statistically reckoned , and in progressiveness , as that might be es ? timated by the rapidity of the industrial turnover . This desire offends those who would still like to regard the South as , in the old sense , a home ; but its expres ? sion is loud and insistent . The urban South , with its heavy importation of regular American ways and regular American citizens , has nearly capitulated to these novelties . It is the village South and the rural South which supply the resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vast quantity of inertia . Will the Southern establishment , the most substantial exhibit on this con ? tinent of a society of the European and historic order , be completely crumbled by the powerful acid of the Great Pro ? gressive Principle ? Will there be no more looking backward but only looking forward ? Is our New World to be dedicated forever to the doctrine of newness ? It is in the interest of America as a whole , as well as in the interest of the South , that these questions press for an answer . I will enter here the most im ? portant items of the situation as well as I can ; doubtless they will appear a little over-sharpened for the sake of exhibition . ( 1 ) The intention of Americans at large appears now to be what it was always in danger of becoming : an in ? tention of being infinitely progressive . But this intention can not permit of an established order of human existence , and of that leisure which conditions the life of intelligence and the arts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be de ? fined in a word , practiced the contrary and European philosophy of establish ? ment as the foundation of the life of the spirit . The ante-bellum Union pos ? sessed , to say the least , a wholesome variety of doctrine . ( 3 ) But the South was defeated by the Union on the battlefield with re ? markable decisiveness , and the two con ? sequences have been dire : the Southern tradition was physically impaired , and has ever since been unable to offer an attractive example of its philosophy in action ; and the American progressive principle has developed into a pure industrialism without any check from a Southern minority whose voice ceased to make itself heard . ( 4 ) The further survival of the South ? ern tradition as a detached local rem ? nant is now unlikely . It is agreed that the South must make contact again with the Union . And in adapting itself to the actual state of the Union , the Southern tradition will have to consent to a certain industrialization of its own . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will permit herself to be so industrialized as to lose entirely her historic identity , and to remove the last substantial barrier that has stood in the way of American progressivism ; or will accept industrialization , but with a very bad grace , and will manage to maintain a good deal of her traditional philosophy . The hope which is inherent in this situation is evident from the terms in which it is stated . The South must be industrialized ? but to a certain extent , and in moderation . The program which now engages the Southern leaders is to see how the South may handle this fire without being badly burned . The South at last is to be physically reconstructed ; but it will be fatal if the South should conceive it as her duty to be regenerated , her spirit re-born with a totally dif ? ferent orientation towards life . And fortunately , the Southern pro ? gram is not perfectly vague , but is capable of a certain definition . There are at least two lines , along either of which an intelligent Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may even move back and forth between them and still advance . The first course would be for the Southern leaders to arouse the sectional feeling of the South to its highest pitch of excitement in defense of all the old ways that are threatened . It may seem rather ungrateful towards the indus ? trialists to accept their generous services in such a churlish spirit . But if one thing is more certain than another , it is that these gentlemen will not be found standing by while they wait for human sympathy . They are already on the scene , and manifesting an inextinguish ? able enthusiasm for their role . The only attitude that needs artificial res ? piration is the resistant attitude of the natives . The resistance will be the fiercest and most effective if industrial ? ism is represented to the Southern people as ? what it undoubtedly is for the most part ? a foreign invasion of Southern soil , which is capable of much more devastation than was wrought when Sherman marched to the sea . From this point of view , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion will now and then forget itself by sonic in ? discretion and be less peaceful . The native and the invader will be sure to come to an occasional clash , and that may offer the chance to revive ancient and almost forgotten animosities . It will be in order to proclaim to Southern ? ers that the carpetbaggers are again in their midst . And it will be well to seize upon and advertise certain Northern industrial communities as horrible ex ? amples of a way of life which Southern ? ers traditionally detest ; not failing to point out the human catastrophe which occurs when a Southern village or rural community becomes the cheap labor of a miserable factory system . It will be doubtless a little hit harder to impress the people with the fact that the new so-called industrial " slavery " not only fastens upon the poor , but blights the middle and better classes of society too ; and to make this point it may be neces ? sary even to revive such a stale antiquity as the old Southern gentleman , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a policy as this would show decidedly a sense of what the Germans call Realpolitik . It could be nasty and unscrupulous , but it could accomplish results . Its net result might be to give to the South eventually a position in the Union analogous more or less to the position of Scotland under the British crown ? a section with a very local and peculiar culture that would , nevertheless , be secure and respected . And Southern traditionalists may take courage from the fact that it was Scottish stubbornness which obtained this position for Scot ? land ; it did not come gratuitously ; it was the consequence of an intense sectionalism that fought for a good many centuries before its fight was won . That is one policy ; and though it is not the only one , it may be necessary to employ it , with discretion , and to bear in mind its Scottish analogue . But it is hardly handsome enough for the best Southerners . Its methods are too easily abused ; it offers too much room for the professional demagogue ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South stake upon it her whole chance of survival . After all , the reconstruction may be undertaken with some imagination , and not necessarily under the formula of a literal restoration . It does not greatly matter to what ex ? tent the identical features of the old Southern establishment are restored ; the important consideration is that there be an establishment for the sake of stability . The other course may not be so easily practicable , but it is certainly more idealistic and statesmanlike . That course is for the South to re-enter the American political field with a determi ? nation and an address quite beyond any ? thing she has exhibited during her half ? hearted national life of the last half a century . And this means specifically that she may pool her own stakes with the stakes of other minority groups in the Union which are circumstanced similarly . There is in active American politics already , to start with , a very belligerent if somewhat uninformed Western agrarian party . Between this party and the South there is much com ? community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , the practice of leisure , and the natural enemy of both is the insidious industrial system . There are also , scattered here and there , nu ? merous elements with the same general attitude which would have some power if united ; the persons and even communi ? ties who are thoroughly tired of pro ? gressivism and its spurious benefits , and those who have recently acquired , or miraculously through the generations preserved , a European point of view ? . sociologists , educators , artists , religion ? ists , and ancient New England town ? ships . The combination of these ele ? ments with the Western farmers and the old-fashioned South would make aformidable bloc . The South is nu ? merically much the most substantial of these three groups , but has done next to nothing to make the cause prevail by working inside the American political system . The unifying effective bond between these geographically diverse elements of public opinion will be the clean-cut policy that the rural life of America must be defended , and the world made safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me that against the power of the industrial spirit no such hope can be entertained . Rut there are some protests in these days rising against the industrial ideal , even from the centers where its grip is the stoutest ; and this would indicate that our human intelligence is beginning again to assert itself . Of course this is all the truer of the European countries , which have re ? quired less of the bitter schooling of experience . Thus Dean Inge declares himself in his Romanes Lecture on " The Idea of Progress " : " I believe that the dissatisfaction with things as they are is caused not only by the failure of nineteenth-century civilization , but partly also by its success . We no longer wish to progress on those lines if we could . Our apocalyptic dream is vanishing into thin air . It may be that the industrial revolution which began in the reign of George the Third has produced most of its fruits , and has had its day . We may have to look forward to such a change as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Penguins , when , after an orgy of revolution and destruc ? tion , we shall slide back into the quiet rural life of the early modern period . If so , the authors of the revolution will have cut their own throats , for there can be no great manufacturing towns in such a society . Their disappearance will be no great loss . The race will have tried a great experiment , and will have rejected it as unsatisfying . " The South has an important part to play , if she will , in such a counter revolution . But what pitiful service have the inept Southern politicians for fifty years rendered to the cause ! Their Southern loyalty at Washington has rarely had any more wildly imagi ? native manifestation than to scramble vigorously for a Southern share in the federal spoils . They will have to be miraculously enlightened . But I get quickly beyond my depth in sounding political possibilities . And perhaps I may as well expose my limita ? tions conclusively by uttering one lastfantastic thought . No Southerner ever dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without providing room for the Democratic party . Is it possible that the Democratic party can really be held to a principle , and that the principle can now be defined as agrarian , conserva ? tive , profoundly social ? It may not be impossible after all . If it proves pos ? sible , then the South may yet be rewarded for a sentimental affection that has persisted in the face of many betrayals.
