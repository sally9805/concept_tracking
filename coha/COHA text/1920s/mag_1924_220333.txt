Said he in Moscow : " England is now the chief task of the Communist International . If we succeed in creating a mass Communist party there , half the European victory will have been achieved . We must not set too low a value on what is going on in England . We must organize a daily Communist paper and create a left flank of trades unions . We must set to work in the British colonies .
