In the Free City of Danzig , which is joined to Poland by a corridor through East Prussia , and which is shepherded by the League of Nations , a postal war was fought last week in novel hues . <P> Germans awoke one fine morning to find that all the mail boxes had been painted white and red-the Polish national colors . The Danzig authorities protested , stating that Poland was permitted postal sovereignty only within the Polish postoffice . The protest fell upon deaf ears . The next night , Germans repainted the mail boxes black , white and red-the old colors of Imperial Germany . Poles , angered , demanded an apology . No apology was given ; the authorities instead asked the League for a ruling . <P> At Warsaw , Polish capital , national ire scaled great heights . The press fumed , warned Danzig that , unless it were more careful , it might become heir to a military occupation . It also reminded the unhappy Germans in Danzig that Poland " has powerful friends " - France , Czecho-Slovakia , Rumania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
