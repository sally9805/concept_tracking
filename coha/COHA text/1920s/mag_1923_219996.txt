Crumbs- <P> A New Novel By The Author of Miss Lulu Bett <P> The Story . By the death in unexpected poverty of her father , Leda Perrin was left at the mercy of her cousins , the Crumbs , of the town of Prospect . The Crumbs are " good folk who are wicked . " They need no description . There are Crumbs everywhere-the intolerable product of the standardization of humanity . They think the same thoughts , eat the same food , do the same things and do them always in groups . A Crumb , finding himself alone in anything would very possibly go mad . They are gross , suffocating vulgarians . Among them are Orrin , the Gideonite salesman , bristling with esprit de corps ; Tweet , his wife , " a fair thick being " ; Mama Crumb , passive housewife ; Pearl , " a lovely , listless sister , a too mellow fruit " ; Richmiel , sleek and perfumed , " whose body had seemed nine-tenths of her being " Grandfather Crumb , old , defeated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above them . Leda 's defenses were being beaten down by the sheer gross weight of the Crumbs when Barnaby came . He was the divorced husband of Richmiel , and he came to take from her silken clutch their boy Oliver . It was inevitable that Leda should find in the imaginative nobility of Barnaby a possible release . And it was equally inevitable that Barnaby should find in the clear glass of Leda 's sensitive beauty the reflection of his need . Richmiel , feline in her jealousies , refused to let Barnaby have his son unless he would go away , leaving Leda behind . He goes . But he comes back , just as the Crumb morass is closing again over Leda 's head , and in the end they find happiness in a spiritual union . The Significance . Miss Gale has made her study by taking two extremes , the extremely sensitive and the extremely coarse , and putting the former at the mercy of the latter There is in this book something more than a minute and ruthless picture of Babbitts at play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at the other side of the picture , even though it may be turned to the wall . There is no tragedy here except the unconscious tragedy of the Crumbs . The beauty of Leda and Barnaby , and the " faint perfume " of their love , rises above all the reek and crassness of the Crumb materialism . If anything , Miss Gale errs on the side of the sentimental . She does not allow the Crumbs the inevitable victory of the harsh over the delicate . <P> The Critics . Dr. Henry Seidel Canby , of The Literary Review , calls Faint Perfume " one of the interesting books in the history of American fiction . " Heywood Broun remarks in The New York World : " We do not know any modern novelist who has achieved such admirable compression . " Other commentators have protested at the " happy ending . " But the book has generally been received as a masterpiece of its kind and as in most respects greatly superior to the much-praised Miss Lulu Bett . <P> The Author .
