ACOLLEGE girl who worked in a department store during the Christmas rush tells us that the high point of her experience came when Mrs. Kip Rhinelander drifted in and bought a scrap basket made out of old bookbindings for $115 . Our friend 's feeling was that it pays to be an honest woman with the law on your side . TT is disappointing to note that 1 judges on the bench continue trying to be funny . It seems to be a growing abuse . Schoolboys have to laugh when the headmaster makes a joke , and similarly the court room always has to chortle with the judge . Humor , however , is rarely the gift of the legal mind ; and almost universally the joke from the bench is the joke of a bully .

WE think less than nothing of the Eskimo who recently received publicity by saying upon his arrival that the thing he noticed most was the cold . We were brought up to believe that the cold is more noticeable in the Arctic than here . The reports of sundry explorers have confirmed our opinion . We therefore conclude that the Eskimo was misquoted .

THERE are a few rebels in the movies , most of them occupying inconsequential positions , so the source of the following screen tale is , obviously , one of the lower five and not of the upper ten . Rin-Tin-Tin , one of the intelligent canine heroes of film dramas , was standing about the studio , waiting his director 's needs ; and in attendance upon the stellar dog , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the species .

Beginning of Wisdom IT is n't often that the clergy of our suburban Methodist churches get a chance to see how the great big world works . Out in one of the Oranges , however , a new wail is going up about the wickedness of sin . It seems that the meek little dominie of this community ran out of gas one night while driving home in his Chevrolet after visiting a parishioner . In great perturbation of spirit , he decided that the only thing to do was to signal a passing motor . The first vehicle was a five-ton truck , the second a smaller and faster truck ; and neither would stop . Probably he was not insistent enough . So with the arrival of the third truck , he ran out boldly and held up his arm  --  and it stopped slowly , quite a distance down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make his trouble known , when the driver slipped an envelope into his hand , stepped on the gas , and hurried , on .

PAUL WHITEMAN , assisting George Gershwin , Ferdie Grofe , Deems Taylor , and other with his estimable orchestra , put New York into a bag last week and shuffled it together . The result was that the audiences in Carnegie Hall Tuesday and Friday took the cake for being representative , and will probably keep it for some time . Side by side sat a heavily coiffeured patron of Baghy 's Musical Mornings , an obscure but intellectual member of the Beethoven group , the second violinist of a night club , playing hooky , a music teacher from Newark , a well known Metropolitan contralto , a jazz lover in a brown suit , with his girl friend , and the season 's most popular undergraduate football hero , who was twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our seat was a young man in golf stockings with beautiful tassels and a youth with a flare for dressing up which would not prevent his following in his father 's footsteps as a cloak and suit man . And next to him was a full dress suit , with accompanying girl in low neck and spangles . Beyond that was the unimportant and noncommittal costume of a musician ; and then a man in an alpaca coat . On the stairs we saw Otto Kahn , Elinor Wylie , and the girl who takes the tickets in a moving picture theatre near Washington Square , all elbowing each other . Everybody pushed everybody else , Carnegie Hall being much too small . Also a lot of English were there , pushing like mad and indicating , as only they can do , their instinctive conclusion that anybody who gets in their way must be rather an inferior sort of person . We hope they got out of the building safely . Altogether it was a wonderful proceeding , the keynote of which was struck when Whiteman came forward before one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jazzy voice .

Ritual VIES ELSIE DE WOLFE alI-YA ways has possessed a real gift for setting the stage , whether professionally or socially , but her genius in this respect seems to have achieved its greatest triumph in what is to everyone else a commonplace and sometimes irritating rite ; that is , in writing checks . Miss de Wolfe 's check book is bound in rich leather . It is placed on a rare Italian piece which , elevated as an altar , dominates her chapel of interior decorating . When it is necessary to write a check , Miss de Wolfe mounts the altar , draws on her slender hands a pair of gloves which match to the last shadow the shade of the leather binding of her check book , and , arrayed for the function , proceeds to pen the document to the order of whoever it may be , Season PLENTY of old timers are about bemoaning the days of the ballrooms that are gone , the dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten , but my impression is that this season is as kindly to current debutantes as previous ones were to their mothers . I hear a good many of the old names mentioned as having been the thing last night . Sherry 's , the Ritz , the Plaza of old vintage ; The Colony Club , Pierre 's of passable antiquity ; The Park Lane as both new and good . The Metropolitan series of dances still lives . All is not lost save honor , by any means . Dances are being given , dates are being made , hearts fluttering , jealousies being vented , much as of old . There is always a preference felt for the different ballrooms . In the old days , the small ballroom of Sherry 's was favored ; good times were had in it . The larger ballroom was called more difficult . In the big room it was harder to make a party go . No one knew why . They were saying this year that for some reason the Ritz and Pierre 's are the best places on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club is too respectable ; Sherry 's is best for teas and dinner dances ; the Plaza is a bit nondescript . Why , no one knows . But the Ritz , I have been told by six different people who say they know , leads the field in power to inspire the stag to do his duty , and the debutante to reward him with a sweet , sweet sinfl e . Roguish to the last , we asked the same six people how the parties were at Webster Hall . Five said they had never heard of the place . The sixth said the same thing , but her expression changed . With Compliments IT 'S a rare heart of gold that is willing to chip off a cubic inch or so and offer it to the enemy . Yet one such organ , it seems , reposes in the In cast of 11.1r . Joseph Leblang , theatre ticket magnet of Broadway . Elvis : It was Mr. Brock Pemberton who wrote the sketch of Mr. Leblang appearing in last week 's issue of this journal . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who bitterly fought the Leblang idea , when the latter was first getting started on its profitable course . When , lately , Mr. Pemberton was gathering material for his Profile , he called on his subject , who , however , misunderstood the purpose of the mission . " Are you producing a play ? " Mr. Leblang inquired of his late opponent . " Maybe you need money ? Well , if you do , count on me for twenty , or fifty , or a hundred grand . " Skating WE did n't skate , but we went and looked at it ; and we observed that the Park Department  --  Mr. Gallatin has been reappointed Commissioner  --  has blown itself to a new skating flag . Last week a fiery red ball on a virgin white ground flaunted over the arsenal at Sixty-third Street . It really is n't an arsenal and has n't been since the Civil War . But it has been everything from a weather bureau to a stable . It 's worth knowing where that flag came from  --  the red and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annin 's Flag Store will vouch for this a Mr. LValker said there ought to be some sign put up when the ice was good in Central Park . There was no telephone ; and , as this Walker truly said , there was no way of finding out about the ice , except by going and trying it . So he and some others approached the stage line which plied up and down Broadway with the proposition that they hang a red ball on the stage when the skating was good . The stages agreed , and the ball was put up . But it was found that people did n't see it . " But they would see a flag , " said Walker . A week later there was a flag , the same flag that last week came out on top of the arsenal , and which in the past seventy-five years has come to mean throughout America that the ice will hear . Pinafore IT was a court of admirals of the United States Navy who exonerated everybody but Providence after inquiring into the loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of our great naval leaders during the last war . The camouflage bureau had painted up the Battleship Rochester , in the approved French technique . But the admiral who inspected the ship before allowing it to leave the artists ' hands was much disappointed . " No good , " he said . " Not in the least effective . And , besides , it will make our ships run into each other in harbor . " Paramount Building THANKS to efficient publicity , many business men are talking about the wonderful thing that is going to happen to Broadway . The dear street is going to be refined . The movies are to do it  --  what else could ? We have heard that Mrs. Valentino was called up by her publicity man and told that it would be worth thousands to her to go down to the boat on which her husband was AI sailing for Paris and a divorce and give his face  --  M ineralavaor no Mineralava ? a good slap . When she refused , she lost caste in movie circles . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , have a different kind , and , they hope , more efficacious . No cheap one-horse Broadway people are to he allowed in their Wonderful New Building , now a hole in the ground at Forty-third Street . They say this right out . Famous Players will take seven floors or so fourth Street , more than a quarter of a million cats a year ? " for the sake of the birds . " The Society 's wagons are always prowling about picking up felines that look as if they would gladly exchange starvation for a bit of chloroform . In Summer , when the cats are out walking , the number of pickups rises to 1,000 a day , and in Winter when the days are crisp and the cellars are the place to live , it drops to as low as 25o . But the Pound men are watching and waiting always . The faithful dog , too , would kill the little sparrow if he knew how . More than 30,000 dogs are sent to Heaven every year and their earthly out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers who are rich enough to use an entire floor . There will not he any typical Broadway window displays downstairs or any garish signs on the roof ; everything will be as subdued and refined as a movie man 's idea of Park Avenue . In the lobby will be stones from various parts of the world . One from the Acropolis , one from the Emperor of Japan , one from the Mexican Government , one from the spot where Captain Cook landed in Australia . They are to give an air of elegance to the place and will be built into the floor and walls . In the middle of it all will be a bust of Adolf Zukor by Mr. Davidson . All this information , and much more , is being broadcast with a view to proving that Paramount is going to refine Broadway . But what is really happening is that Paramount is putting up a fine building at Forty-third Street with a theatre in it to seat 5,000 people . They expect to make money . Richesse Oblige ACCORDING to irate denizens of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pulled their usual trick. , At this time of year , liquor , servant problem , school problem , and clothes for the South all have to give way as subjects of conversation to the subject of holiday tipping . The lady on our right says : " I had fourteen to take care of . . . imagine . . . six elevator boys , two doormen , two superintendents , a fireman , a plumber , and two charmen . " " Bah ! " retorts the old gentleman , " I asked my superintendent bow many I had and he said eighteen , but . . . " " I had nineteen , " cuts in our hostess politely . Her cousin , however , won with twenty-f our . Then follows the indignation meeting . For it appears that half the doormen , who as a class have even less conscience than plumbers , pocketed their share of the tips and left , presumedly for Florida . New ones have taken their places and are saying meaningfully that it is hard work standing out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said a lady in the bus , " the cat must be kept down . " It was one of those vehement conversations worth listening to . And everything was said in it but the truth , which is that something very energetic is being done to keep the cat down . Good lady , the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , in cooperation with the Health Department , catches and destroys , at their pound in Avenue A and Twentyremains removed by the Dead Animal Removal Company . Most of the dogs , however , are killed at the request of owners  --  only 3,000 are pickups . The dog , in other words , is more moral than the cat . But the cat should worry . IT 'S a gloomy picture . But Madame Helene , with whom we accidentally discussed the matter , has a happier picture . In London , she says , there is a cat-meat man who makes the rounds of the residential sections , giving bits of liver and other nice things to happy cats . No vagrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have charge accounts and pay monthly . Riposte VISITING English novelists serve V at least one useful function . They retail to us the latest stories about Mr. George Bernard Shaw , who has made himself esteemed in America by refusing to visit it . One of the late stories concerns Mr. Shaw 's attending a tea in London , not so very long ago , at which the redoubtable Mr. Samuel Goldwyn was also a guest . The moving picture impressario arrived wearing  --  as one might expect ? a steamer cap . He had landed a week before . What better target might a George Bernard Shaw wish than a moving picture producer , in a steamer cap ? The barbed arrows flew with the speed and thickness of dark clouds before a March wind . Yet , Mr. Goldwyn was unmoved . Arrows , in his young life , meant merely that " Robin Hood " had been a box office success ; nothing more . " You moving picture producers sicken me , " said Mr. Shaw , finally . " You are like a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a shelf and surveying himself in a mirror , announces that the hat does n't suit him . Then he throws the hat on the floor , stamps on it , picks the battered , dirty thing up , places it on his head and announces triumphantly that he has just what he wants . " " But , Mr. Shaw , " Mr. Goldwyn in force between the two parties expressly prohibiting Sunday shows . The Managers say actors can take their Sunday in the middle of the week ; the Actors say they do n't want to . A member of " The Green Hat " company says there are enough Sundays already  --  Jewish , Christian , and when Mr. Arlen is in the country , Armenian  --  without making another one .

MHERE is always some wonder ' ing where the movies go when they leave New York .

Pastimes AMERICAN sub-debutantes are , even now , in the process of being prepared for their debuts by schools in various capitals of the Old World , including Madrid .

They sat themselves in a front row box and waited , in the best Plaza tea time manner , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay ; officials dashed about ; there was much gesticulation and argument . What appeared to be a committee meeting held forth in the middle of the arena and finally despatched to the American girls ' box a most courteous messenger . With flourish and compliments and well wishes for the health of the young ladies , long life for their President and long life for the President 's wife and so on and so on , the messenger wished to know if the young ladies would mind  --  er -- er -- well , in short no one would pay any attention to the bulls , matador , picador , etc. , until the young ladies  --  well , would the young ladies mind putting their coats over their legs . The girls acceded and the Spanish then reluctantly went on with their own national pastime . objected , innocently . " But , Mr. Shaw , I am not wearing a hat .
