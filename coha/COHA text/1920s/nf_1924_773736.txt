txt // kind . For instance , in early Rome it was the custom for the people to carry small trinkets as gifts to the senators under whose protection they found themselves . It became a definite custom to present definite gifts to the senators . But when ? Naturally , a definite time had to be arranged to avoid confusion and to make the little ceremony of gift-making impressive and effective . The New Year 's Gift. ? The Romans decided upon the first day of the new year as an appropriate time to make their presentations to the senators . And it has been the custom ever since for friends to exchange gifts on New Year 's Day . Let us see why this day was chosen . There are two possible explanations . In the first place , New Year 's Day was a time of celebration and thus a propitious time to make gifts . But perhaps the main reason for making gifts at this time was to invite protection from the senators during the ensuing year . Suetonius and Tacitus both mention the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claudius made it a law that presents could actually be demanded on this day , but on no other day during the year . According to the records that have come down to us , the gifts were usually trinkets of some sort ? the fancy of the moment , no doubt ? although there are some instances of exquisite fabrics and of wearing apparel being presented to men in high office . There are also instances of gifts of flowers and fruit , usually in pretty baskets . The Romans who settled in Britain introduced to their neighbours the custom of making gifts on New Year 's Day . It became the custom among the early English to clean the chimney on this day so that luck could descend and remain all year . Among us , instead of " cleaning the chimney " we " clean the slate , " and make good resolutions for the following year . Perhaps this custom of cleaning the chimney so that good luck might descend has something to do with the Santa Claus myth . Surely Santa Claus with his pack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // From Britain the custom of making gifts on New Year 's Day spread all over Europe . In Spain and in France the habit took firm hold . Even in faraway Persia it became the custom to exchange eggs as gifts on New Year 's Day . Here we see another significance : The beginning of life , of creation , is symbolized by the egg . New Year 's Day is the beginning , or creation , of a new year . Thus , it seemed to the Persians , no gift could be more appropriate at this time than the gift of eggs . The same significance is seen in our gift of coloured eggs to children at Eastertime . History records that during the reign of Queen Elizabeth the custom of presenting New Year 's gifts was carried to great extremes . Gifts of extravagant value were presented to the Queen , and the people made many gifts among themselves . One authority tells us that not the least valuable of the gifts which the Queen received was a pair of black silk knit stockings . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen had worn cloth hose . But the gift so delighted her that she vowed never to wear cloth hose again . Nor did she ! It was during this period of extravagant gift-making that gloves became a popular New Year 's gift . Like the inevitable box of candy of modern life , the pair of gloves became the obvious gift when one was unable to make another selection . The Christmas Gift. ? With us , the New Year 's gift is not quite as popular as the Christmas gift . Everyone ? except a Scrooge ? exchanges gifts at Christmas-time . It was a custom among the Romans for the priest to put a box on all outgoing ships . The people were required to put something into it ? a gift in the form of a trinket or a piece of money . It was known as the Priest 's Box . When the ship was ready to sail , the box was sealed and went to sea with it . Among the Scotch and the Irish it was a custom to throw a shoe after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Priest 's Box was intended to serve the same purpose . But authorities tell us that when the ship returned the box was given to the Priest ; it was placed aside until Christmas , at which time mass was said and it was opened . Sometimes the money was kept by the church ; sometimes it was distributed among the poor . It is related that frequently , at the opening of the Priest Box ? which later became known as the Christmas Box ? those who had not placed anything in it came forward and offered gifts in the form of money or jewellery . The purpose was to supplicate the saints and win forgiveness for sins . If the truth be known , it is for very much the same reason that Christmas gifts are often exchanged to-day . We feel a little ' better , a little more self-sacrificing , a little nobler when we have made others happy through gifts . During the early period of Christianity it was the custom for poor men and women to sing carols in the streets at Christmas-time . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was of the carols they sang , most likely , but because it was the custom to do so . And custom , among superstitious peoples , is sacred . They were afraid that evil would befall them if they did not make gifts to the singers who carolled Christ 's praise . Another custom was for men who were skilled in carpentry to make miniature reproductions of the Christ child in the stable . Some really remarkable reproductions were made , showing the cradle , Mary , the Child , even the Wise Men bringing their gifts . There are several such reproductions still in existence . The makers paraded the streets at Christmas showing their handiwork to the people . They even went into homes to show their " cradles , " as they were called . If by any chance some clever fellow had added a new little twist  --  such as painting the whole thing or illumining it in some way ? he was surrounded by an admiring crowd who carried him around in triumph . If he were as clever an // actor as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that he was a prophet ? divinely inspired . And his gifts were rich accordingly ! The exchange of gifts at Christmas-time possibly grew out of the desire to emulate the amazing unselfishness of Christ . In later life , of course , the exchange of gifts would have become traditional , customary . And a certain joyousness , induced by the exchange of gifts and the merrymaking accompanying it , inspired a genuine generosity . The custom was nurtured in Germany . Here it became the habit to make periodic exchange of gifts among friends , relatives , acquaintances . It became an obligation , and to escape it the man with many friends sometimes took a trip abroad at this period . From Germany , the custom of Christmas gift-making spread over Europe . It crossed the sea and was brought to the struggling colonists who had tried to cut loose from all the Old-World influences . It has become more and more an institution , as the generations have slipped by , and to-day we exchange gifts at Christmas as a matter of course . Gifts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children goes far back into prehistory . There are at various museums actual dolls , animals , and other toys which have been taken out of the long buried tombs of infants . Love of offspring appears to have been prevalent even in primitive times , despite the records of infanticide . The Fijians , famous for cannibalism and savagery , are greatly attached to their children , and the children to their parents . The Tongans and New Zealanders are said to be extremely fond of , and kind to , their children . Among the Greenlanders , passed by in the march of civilization , the bonds of parental love seem stronger than with almost any other people . We can very easily picture a savage father of long ago bringing a curious shell for his child to play with . We can // see a savage mother carefully whittling a flint or bone toy that her child might have something with which to be amused . Among these primitive peoples , marriage was not considered binding until a child was born . The birth of the child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps all the clansmen or tribesmen presented gifts to the new-born child . It would have been a ceremony ? to show the child he was welcome and among friends . But as we have said , there are actual records to prove that gift-making to children existed at an early date . It is not necessary to peer behind the unknown and try to fathom the primitive mind . Painted clay puppets ? some in the form of humans , some in the form of animals ? were given to early Egyptian children as playthings . We know that these were toys , and not amulets or fetishes , for they are found only in the tombs of infants or young children . ( See illustrations . ) There have also been found in the tombs of Egyptian children small wooden carts , houses , and ships . An ancient Egyptian ball is in existence which has small stones inside of it , so that when one shakes it , it rattles . This was probably the forerunner of the rattle as we know it today . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth of the child was simulated . The man who adopted the child gave it rich gifts , to prove that he was able to take care of it . In ancient Greece a great ceremony took place on the tenth day after the birth of the child . A feast was given by the parents ? the purpose , we are told , was to imply the father 's acknowledgment of the child 's legitimacy ? and the friends and relatives who were invited brought toys of metal or clay for the infant . The mother was presented with rich painted vases . Gifts have always accompanied christenings . During the Middle Ages the child was usually presented by its // godparents with silver or gold spoons . It is very possible that the phrase " born with a silver spoon in his mouth " arose from this old custom . The custom of presenting the children with gifts at Christmas was most pronounced among the Germans in early life . Kris Kringle is their name for Santa Claus . It is derived from Krist Kindli which means Christ Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized as being particularly a child 's holiday . Saint Nicholas , or Santa Claus , is regarded as the patron saint of Christmas . The old nursery myth is that he comes down the chimney with a pack on his back to leave gifts for good children . It is possible that this myth originated with the custom of cleaning the chimney at the beginning of the new year to enable good luck to enter the household ( see p. 280 ) . A housewife , busy cleaning the chimney at about the Christmas period , might have whispered to her children , to keep them out of mischief , that if they were good Santa Claus would come down the chimney and bring gifts for them . Tremendously impressed , the children would have hurried with the news to their little friends . And so it would have spread , becoming finally the popular nursery myth that it is to-day . CHAPTER X CORRESPONDENCE , AND THE HISTORY OF WRITING As the art of writing and reading spread , came that old desire , that pathetic desire so common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person by writing down something striking , some secret one knew , some strange thought , or even one 's name , so that long after one had gone one 's way , it might strike upon the sight and mind of another reader . Even in Sumeria men scratched on walls , and all that remains to us of the ancient world , its rocks , its buildings , is plastered thickly with the names and the boasting of those foremost among human advertisers , its kings . ? H. G. WELLS . THE BEGINNING OF WRITTEN RECORDS THE communicating of facts , thoughts , ideas , or fancies through writing belongs to an advanced stratum of development . We know that the world has had a long , dim history which has been left practically unrecorded . We know that it has had an intermediate history which has bequeathed to us a wealth of material relics , but still no written records of what man thought or felt . The third great period of social development , of which we to-day are a part , is illumined by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely conceive of the tremendous influence which writing , and its sister art , printing , have had upon human affairs . Of course , we can not be certain when writing began , any more than we can be certain when speech began , or faith , or art , or any other human quality which is based upon long ages of development . Not even the historian can definitely tell us when writing began . Nor can the archxologist go back any farther than the records which he understands . 286 // We can only guess that some early dreamer sat on the bank of a river and with experimental twig or finger made curious , fanciful patterns in the wet clay . We can only guess that some Palaeolithic caveman , drawing bears and buffalos on the wall of his cave was attempting to express some crude thought that crowded through his mind ? a thought lost to us for ever . We can only guess that infant systems of writing lie buried with forgotten civilizations , and that at some future time they may yet be discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the origin of writing and the first written records of mankind . We know that before any genuine sort of writing made its appearance , a kind of picture writing existed . The North American Indians appear to have been highly advanced in this art . Examples of their picture writing show us how even the most elaborate messages could be conveyed through this simple means . Picture writing is merely a system of conveying thoughts or facts through pictures . There is in use in Europe to-day a timetable which has small black signs or pictures on it for the purpose of guiding tourists . A tiny cup on this timetable indicates a place where refreshments may be had . Various other signs indicate things of importance to the traveller . This simple and elementary method of conveying ideas constituted the first kind of writing . It existed among the early Egyptians , the early Babylonians , the Chinese , the American Indians . It exists to-day among savage and untaught people all over the world . It is the simplest , crudest , and most elementary way of recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture and imitative sound bear to speech ( see p. 126 ) . At first picture writing was a device rather than a system . It helped man express his ideas , not only to his fellows but to himself . He devised the method of drawing pictures for his own convenience and satisfaction . // There could have been no attempt , at this early stage , to create a definite system . That would have come later . At first each picture would represent one thought in itself . The person who saw the picture would be obliged to supply by imagination what was lacking . We are inclined to believe that there is a long train of thoughts and ideas behind every crude drawing found on the walls of Pala'olithic caves . Systems of Complex Picture Writing. ? But gradually , as picture writing developed , it grew into a system of signs for expressing ideas ; that is , two or more pictures were combined into what we call " words " to express , not one simple idea , but a trend of thought . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing . " A form of complex picture writing is found in Egypt . It is familiarly known as hieroglyphic writing , and many excellent specimens are to be found on monuments , mummy cloths , temple walls , etc . Photographs of hieroglyphic writing are reproduced on these pages . Another form of hieroglyphic writing which existed in Egypt and which was used by the priests is known as hieratic writing . It is much simpler and the characters take on a flowing form , like our script . This type of writing was used in letters , in the keeping of accounts , the writing of psalms , deeds , etc . The hieroglyphic writing was used on the monuments and the temples , and wherever a decorative effect was required . The Egyptian hieroglyphic writing is one of the finest survivals of picture writing we have . Some monumental examples date back almost to 5000 B.C. The discovery of the Rosetta stone by the French engineers attached to Napoleon 's expedition to Egypt in 1799 was the master key to the reading of this hieroglyphic writing . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still another kind was developing among the Babylonians . At first these people had a crude and primitive picture writing which shows signs of having // emerged , very possibly , out of hieroglyphic writing . Ex290 THE CUSTOMS OF MANKIND isting specimens in no case show more than half-a-dozen lines . The now famous cuneiform writing ( from Latin , cuneus , a wedge ) replaced the simple picture writing of the Babylonians . It was invented by a people known as the Sumerians . They used the pictures to represent sounds apart from ideas ? the first people to do this . With a wedgeformed implement they wrote first on stone , later on clay . This cuneiform writing of the Sumerians spread with amazing rapidity . It was adopted by the Babylonians and by them passed on to the Assyrians . The latter simplified some of the characters and conventionalized many . Its influence passed even to Egypt and hieroglyphic writing ceased to be simply pictographic ; it became a sound-sign system . This method of writing became widespread ; it was used as a means of correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inland as the Persian Gulf . The word " cuneiform " was used for the first time in 1700 by Thomas Hyde , well-known as a professor of Hebrew in the University of Oxford . The term has found general acceptance among historians . But another familiar and popular name for this type of writing is " arrowhead writing . " The Origin of 4lphabetic Writing. ? It is to the eternal glory of the Phoenicians that they invented alphabetic writing . The word " alphabet " itself is from the Greek names for the first two letters , " a " and b " ? alpha and beta . But the Phoenician alphabet existed long before the Greeks attempted to write their traditions and their mythology for record . Cuneiform writing was , of course , the great impetus that led to the origin of the Phcenician alphabet . The Egyptians , the Babylonians , the Assyrians , and other peoples were using a method of writing whereby articulate // sounds were being represented to the eye by complex forms and figures . But we can understand how unwieldy this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend itself to ordinary or extensive use ; it was cumbersome and complicated . The Phoenicians took the one feature of Egyptian writing which could be universally applied , disentangled it from the jumbled mass of signs and pictures , made of it a unit , and created therefrom a system , or method , of writing based upon an alphabet . They achieved the greatest step forward in the art of writing . Because of its obvious simplicity and its universal application , this form of alphabetic writing quickly spread . It was carried eveitywhere . It spread over the whole Asiatic continent . It found its way to Crete , to Thera , to Greece , to Italy . It passed on into Europe and firmly established itself there . It became , in a word , the writing system of the whole civilized world . Early Writing Materials. ? Bef ore proceeding with the further development of writing , as it concerns correspondence , let us glance at the materials which were being used . With what did early man write ? And on what did he record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , of course , the earliest records we have . Much of the literature of the old civilization was written on clay baked into stone . Photographic examples are given . When ' portable manuscripts became desirable , many materials were pressed into service . The skins of animals , the leaves of plants , linen , fragments of tile ? all were used . There is a charming Pompeian wall painting which shows a girl holding a double tablet of clay in her hand , her " pencil " to her chin as though she is pondering . She is evidently writing a love letter . For writing on clay tablets a slender , four-sided piece of wood was used . It was a forerunner of our pencil . The ancient Egyptians wrote chiefly on linen or wood with a brush or reed pen . But for literary work , for official documents and for the " Book of the Dead " they used papyrus . The papyrus is a tall , graceful plant , the pith of which was pressed flat and thin and joined with others to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written and painted . Fragile though it may seem papyrus is very enduring and there is a piece in existence which is said to date back to 3500 B.C. Some priceless records , indeed , are preserved for all time on the papyrus pages of Egypt 's literature . The use of papyrus descended to the Greeks and Romans . From its name comes our word " paper " ; and from the " roll " or volumen of papyrus manuscript comes our word " volume " as applied to a book . The Greeks and Romans wrote upon papyrus , which // they burnished with a polishing stone , with a reed cut to a point . This reed writing instrument was very similar to our pen . They used an ink made from cuttlefish . The early scribes were well-equipped to write enduring records ' of the things they did , and thought , and felt , and wondered about . The Greeks originally followed the example of the Phoenicians and wrote from right to left . But later the priests decided to write the oracles in the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right was of good omen . They reformed the habit of writing , and originated the custom of writing from left to right . We still observe this custom , or habit , and undoubtedly always will . It is interesting to note the antiquity of carrying the pen or pencil behind the ear . We notice the following passage in the life of S. Odo : " He who saw a pen sticking above his ear , in the manner of a writer . " By the 7th century feather pens were common , and double inkstands , for red and black ink , were being used . The First Books. ? With language , alphabet , and materials , with reasoning faculties and imagination , man was beginning to write of the things that interested him . The long pent-up desire for self-expression found outlet in crude attempts to write down the thoughts and ideas that crowded through his mind . There was born the overwhelm. - ing wish to tell , to confide , to record , to astonish . Man became distinctly conscious of his own imaginative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , as far as he was able , the traditions which formerly he had orally related . The influence of writing upon human thought can not be estimated . Man 's experiences no longer died with him , unless he so desired . He was able to record his thoughts and his secrets . He was able to communicate those thoughts to men hundreds of miles away . He was able to share his own knowledge , and share in the knowledge // of others . Slowly , gradually , surely , writing exerted its magic influence upon the mind of man , and priceless treasures of knowledge were being stored for us who were fortunate enough to come at a later day . But we must not imagine that the full benefits of writing were flashed all at once upon a waiting world . At first writing was a slow and painful process . Books were written word for word by the author , and his copy was the only copy . There was no way of multiplying it , except by copying it all over again . Naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must remember that the book must at first have been a sort of mystery to the ordinary person . Only the priest and the student understood it . For a long time the benefits of writing were denied the world as ' a whole ; but with the discovery of paper a tremendous stride was taken . Concerning the great impetus to thought which writing had upon mankind , H. G. Wells says // From the first writings onward , a new sort of tradition , an enduring and immortal tradition , began in the minds of men . Life , through mankind , grew thereafter more and more distinctly conscious of itself and its world . It is a thin streak of intellectual growth we trace in history , at first in a world of tumultuous ignorance and forgetfulness ; it is like a mere line of light coming through the chink in an opening door into a darkened room ; but slowly it widens , it grows . At last came a time in the history of Europe when the door , at the push of the printer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as it flared , it ceased to be the privilege of a favoured minority . The Discovery of Paper. ? Papyrus , of course , was a form of paper . But the supply of papyrus was limited . It had to be fastened strip by strip , and there was neither a uniform size nor quality . Learned men , eager to set down and record their thoughts and experiences , began to dream of better materials and easier methods of writing . Paper as we know it originated in China . It was in use as early as the 2d century B.C. , but it was not until the 8th century A.D. that the secret of making it was learned from the Chinese . During an encounter with the Arab Moslems several Chinese who were skilled papermakers were taken , and they taught the art to the Arabs . Paper manufacture flourished in Arabia from the 9th century onward . But it was not until close to the 14th century that really good paper was made in Europe , Italy leading in its manufacture . Origin and Development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most fascinating phases of human development ? the discovery of the printing press and its effect upon the world . It must have been like the rise of a glorious new sun . What one read before , thousands were now able to share . What was once the privilege of a few became the property of all . Schoolbooks were cheapened and placed within the reach of everyone . Mankind entered upon a new intellectual era . You can see the immediate result , of course . As the books now being made were easier to read , simpler to understand , infinitely cheaper to buy , more people began to // read . Quickly the art of printing spread . Quickly books were multiplied . And quickly the firebrand set intellectual flames burning brightly all over Europe . At first an abundance of Bibles made their appearance . Then the first great European literatures began . Language lost a great deal of its dialect ; it became polished , literary . More and more books made their appearance ; they became still easier to read , still less like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world read . The first printing from movable type appears to have been achieved by Coster in Haarlem ( Holland ) at about 1445 . At about the same period the famous Gutenberg was printing at Mainz . Almost simultaneously printers began to turn out books in Italy and when , in 1477 , Caxton set up his press in Westminster , printing was established as a new and remarkably useful art . Like all other great advances , printing permeated the social fabric and its influence coloured the lives of the people . In all the great ages , or stages , of development , intercommunication was the great impetus toward the strengthening of the social life of the multitudes . Gesture , the very first kind of intercommunication , made two savage fellows friendly when they might otherwise have fallen upon each other . Speech separated man for ever from the lower animals ; it bound men together in common intercourse . And it brought into being the storyteller , the myth-maker , the wanderer from clan to clan , from tribe to tribe , from people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went . Writing , as a means of intercommunication , broadened the intellectual horizon , made it possible for man to share his thoughts with another many miles away , made it possible for him to record his experiences to entertain or enlighten others . Printing made mass thought possible . It set the mind of mankind free . It placed knowledge within the reach of the lower classes . It enabled one part of Europe to know what the other part was doing , saying , thinking , // planning . It gave to all of mankind a better , clearer , saner knowledge of itself and of the world . To the present generation , printing is no longer the marvel , the astonishing achievement , it seemed to earlier peoples . Like so many other of the good things of life , it is simply accepted . Yet printing has , directly and indirectly , done more to change the manners and customs of man than any other one development . Out of printing grew advertising , and advertising is subtly , surely , inevitably changing the mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners of the globe , discovers what is needed by the people there , and supplies the demand . It turns its searchlight upon the smallest town , the tiniest community , and tells the people there precisely what the woman in the metropolis is wearing , doing , saying , how she is entertaining , where she is going . With this influence constantly and increasingly at work , it is inevitable that many age-old traditions be at last discarded  --  or at least changed sufficiently to accord with the new order of things as portrayed in the advertising pages . No history could give to posterity a clearer knowledge of our daily life and our customs of living than the advertising pages of our modern newspapers and magazines . They are a precise record of what we are doing and wearing ; how we are entertaining ; what we are using  --  what we want . We can not leave the subject of intercommunication and its influence upon the manners and customs of man without mentioning the moving pictures . They , too , have changed to a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is able to see how her millionaire sister lives , and when the millionaire girl is able to see how her slum sister lives , there is bound to be a reaction of some sort . But the influence of the moving pictures has , as yet , scarcely been felt . It will be the pleasant task of some later writer to record the effect of the moving pictures upon mass life . The telephone , the telegraph , the radio , the wireless ? all are modes of intercommunication . But they are merely // like links in the great chain of intellectual progress set free by the printing press . THE SOCIAL INVITATION Writing very early became a device for making social affairs run more smoothly . Writing in the sense of books , newspapers , records , stories is one thing ; writing in the sense of social correspondence , invitations , cards of greeting , congratulation , and condolence is quite another . The North American Indians were among the first to use actual invitations . They burned their message on buckskin and sent it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tribes also had a smoke message which they used to call their people together for purposes of feasting , celebrating , etc . This smoke message was used sometimes in warfare . It appears that among the Indians , ever a hospitable people , the development of the invitation was rapid and marked . Long before 1600 the Algonquins were sending out " dinner invitations " in the form of specially cut blocks of wood about the size of the little finger . All those who received the bit of wood with its curious picture message knew that they were invited to attend the feast and celebration being given by the Algonquins . They came from far and wide to join the merrymaking . Among early European peoples the invitation developed slowly . The peasantry , of course , had no need for any such thing as an invitation ; if one of their number wished to celebrate at the public bar or in his home , he merely called all his friends together with as much proud noise as he could command . Among the upper classes a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of Shakespeare the invitation had reached a fairly high point of development . The mode of the written invitation first found favour at court and then spread to the people in the cities . These invitations were // written on huge sheets of white paper , by hand , the initial letters usually made by stamp and decorated with colour . " So many guests invite as here are writ , " says Shakespeare . The invitations were carried by pages or messengers to the homes of the people for whom they were intended , and usually an answer was required , in the manner of our acknowledgment . The development of the wedding invitation was particularly marked . In small villages the wedding bells ringing sweetly from the church belfry were the only invitation . All the friends and neighbours gathered together to greet the bridal party . But in large towns and cities it became necessary to invite by written word those who were to attend the wedding ceremonies . The following rare old invitation , written in 1786 , was clipped by William Hone from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his famous " Table Book . " Here is an exact reproduction of the invitation : INVITATION Suspend for one day your cares and your labours , And come to this wedding , kind friends and good neighbours . Notice is hereby given that the marriage of Isaac Pearson with Frances Atkinson will be solemnized in due form in the parish church of Lamplugh , in Cumberland , on Tuesday next , the 30th of May inst. ( 1786 ) ; immediately after which the bride and bridegroom with their attendants will proceed to Lonefoot , in the said parish , where the nuptials will be celebrated by a variety of rural entertainments . Then come one and all , At Hymen 's soft call . From Whitehaven , Workington , Harington , Dean , Hail , Ponsonby , Blaing , and all places between ; From Egremont , Cockermouth , Barton , St. Bee 's , Cint , Kinnyside , Calder and parts such as these ; And the country at large may flock in if they please . // Such sports there will be as have seldom been seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And races for prizes , for frolic and fun By horses and asses and dogs will be run , That you 'll go home happy ? as sure as a gun . In a word , such a wedding can ne'er fail to please ; For the sports of Olympus were trifles to these . Note Bene ? You 'll please observe that the day Of this grand bridal pomp is the thirtieth of May , When ' t is hoped that the sun , to enliven the sight , Like the flambeau of Hymen , will deign to burn bright . This specimen of an 18th-century wedding invitation is doubly valuable . Not only does it reveal to us the kind of wedding invitations that were being written and publicly printed in those days , but it gives us an excellent picture of the kind of weddings that were then in vogue . Can you imagine races by dogs and horses at the modern marriage ? Can you imagine fencing and wrestling and the " country at large " ? flocking in ? Compare the above invitation with this example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Grey Taylor request the honour of your presence at the marriage of their daughter Helen Marie and Mr. Raymond Mitchell on Friday , the fourth of June at six o'clock at the Presbyterian Church Boston The custom of posting invitations did not come until comparatively late . Not because posting was unknown ? a royal post system existed even in ancient Persia . But for a long time a popular superstition made it an insult to send an invitation any other way than by personal messenger . But gradually this superstition passed out of favour , and soon everyone who entertained was posting // invitations ? recognizing this as a simple expedient toward getting guests together . Ceremonial Announcements. ? When anything of importance happens the natural impulse is to announce it to everyone . If we are unhappy , we want others to know of , and share in , that unhappiness . If we are joyous or proud , we want others to know of it , and be joyous or envious according to the circumstances .

A certain number of beats announce a birth ; an entirely different number and variety of beats announce a death . People everywhere , since early times , have had ways and means of announcing to others the things that interested them . The festive dance of the Indians is a method of announcing a wedding , just as it is a method of celebrating it . The crepe on the door is a method of announcing death . Writing , to a large extent , did away with pantomimic and dramatic forms of announcement . The transition was slow and gradual , of course , and many of the dramatic survivals are still noticeable in modern life . But slowly , surely , the written announcement gained its foothold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards are sent to friends and relatives to announce the birth of a child .

In the development of social life it became necessary to write notes of congratulation , sympathy , appreciation . The receipt of a card of announcement would require some sort of acknowledgment . Each age has had its needs , and always those needs have been supplied . The development of the art of letter-writing is a fascinating study in itself , and a fair discussion of it would fill a book . It was born in very early times but was confined at first to students , priests , and learned men . It followed painfully in the wake of writing , and received its greatest impetus with the discovery of a good and cheap paper . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its highest point of development in the 17th and 18th centuries . It entered social life and found a peculiar place for itself in the heart of the hostess . It swept with a flourish through the 19th century . It waned perceptibly with the discovery of the telephone , the telegraph . But it still holds an important place in the social scheme . On a certain occasion Lord Chesterfield 's son sent some Arquebusade water to his aunt . She sent him a letter of thanks and enclosed in it a letter from the Lord . In this letter , Lord Chesterfield gave a draught of a letter which he recommended that his son write in answer to the aunt . To avoid hurting his feelings , he wrote : I hope you will not be offended at my offering you my assistance upon this occasion ; because I presume that , as yet , you are not much used to write to ladies . A propos of letter-writing , the best models that you can form yourself upon are Cicero , Cardinal d'Ossat , Madame Sevigne and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his familiar friends are the best examples that you can imitate , in the friendly and familiar style . The simplicity and the clearness of Cardinal d'Ossat 's letters show how letters of business ought to be written ; no affected turns , no attempts at wit , to obscure or perplex the matter , which is always clearly and plainly stated , as business always should be . For gay and amusing letters , for enjouement and badinage , there are none that equal Comte Bussey 's and Madame Sevigne 's . They // are so natural that them seem to be the extempore conversations of two people of wit , rather than letters which are commonly studied , though they ought not to be so . I would advise you to let that book be one in your itinerant library ; it will both amuse and inform you . I have not time to add any more now , so good-night . To Lord Chesterfield 's excellent advice we will add a word more . If you wish to learn not only a crisp , excellent style for letter-writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdotes , witticisms , paradoxes , for use in conversation , by all means read and study Lord Chesterfield 's letters to his son . But do not pattern yourself after him or after any one else . Remember this paragraph from " The Book of Etiquette " : Letters should be written personally ? that is , they should represent the sender . Be sure , first , that you know exactly what you want to say and how you want to say it . Then put it down on paper as though you were speaking ; make no pretense at being so very highly educated that you must use flowery language and poetical phrases . Simplicity in wording and in form is the most effective and graceful method . It is a greater mark of learning and intelligence to write a simple , ably expressed , cordial letter , than to write one that shows an obvious effort to cover , by extravagant and highly figurative language , the reserve and dignity that are the foundation of all good breeding . Concerning . the Salutation. ? Forms of salutation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , although some forms of salutation originated in the English court . For a long time the only form of salutation used in letter-writing was " God keep you ! " or its equivalent . The use of " Your humble servant " first came into use in England at the marriage of Queen Mary , daughter of Henry IV of France . It was derived from Potre tres humble serviteur . Such forms as " Your obedient servant " and " Your humble servant " are still used in letters of importance . In 16th-century France they were used by everyone ; no other form was used , That the English still have sur304 THE CUSTOMS OF MANKIND vivals of this salutation emphasizes the importance with which French manners and customs were regarded by the social world . Much etiquette concerns the salutations in letters to royalty . Garrick Mallery , in an article which appeared some time ago in the American Anthropologist , says : A private person writing to royalty used the largest sheet of paper procurable and only four written lines at the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remainder of the page being left blank after the form title , which should be distributed through at least five lines . Six lines of the epistle to a prince might appear on the first page , and so on in graduation . Wars have been occasioned by the breach of this etiquette . The enmity between Cardinal Richelieu and the Duke of Buckingham arose because his haughty eminence addressed the Duke without leaving any space open after the title of Monsieur , which insult his Grace returned in the same paper-sparing manner . At this period France was making the social laws for all Europe . Madame de Geniis records that " all men , even princes of the blood , must place the word respect ' in letters written to any woman . " The English copied this form of courtesy , and both French and English still use to-day such phrases as " respectful homage " and " respectful regard . " Our phrase " respectfully yours " appears to have been borrowed from them . The etiquette of correspondence is very much simpler in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct forms of the social letters ? the formal and the informal says " The Book of Etiquette . The formal social note is used only for invitations , announcements , and their respective acknowledgments . It is always written in the third person , and always requires an answer . The informal note has no definite formula , except that it can be generally compared to all the informal trend of correct social usage . Whether formal or informal , the social note always bears the name of the person to whom it is addressed . When writing socially to Mrs. Joselyn , for instance , one does not use the expression " Dear Madam , " but " Dear // Mrs. Joselyn . " The form " my dear " is considered a trifle more formal than just " dear , although in England the reverse is true . " Dear Madam " and " Dear Sir " are forms reserved exclusively for use with business letters . In closing the letters , the forms " Very truly yours " and " Yours truly " express a certain formality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yours most sincerely , " " Cordially yours , " " Very affectionately yours . " The pronoun " yours " should not be omitted as it leaves the phrase unfinished and is not complimentary to the person addressed . Flowery forms have entirely disappeared from correct letter writing , and a dignified simplicity prevails instead . Crests and Monograms. ? Elaborate crests , seals , and monograms were at one time considered an essential part of social correspondence . Fashionable stationery to-day bears neither crest nor seals ; and the monogram if used at all , is simple and inconspicuous . " The monogram , " says Symmachus , " is a name set forth in an abbreviated form , and so compacted by certain intertwinings of the letters as to be more easily understood than read . " The Greeks are supposed by most authorities to have been the first to use monograms . Beautiful combinations of letters are to be found on old Greek coins ; and elaborate seals and monograms are found on ancient rings . The Romans , copyists of the Greeks in almost everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first , however , to use monograms to express family names . As one writer says , " Greece was the seed-ground of arts , but it was in Rome that they flowered . " The early kings of France and emperors of Germany used monograms because they were not able to write , and their signatures were required on documents . Eginbard , the biographer of Charlemagne , tells us that this was precisely the case with the great ruler . He was unable to write , so he had a monogram made and he used it whenever his signature was required . // King Theodoric ( A.D. 493 ? 526 ) was extremely illiterate , according to all accounts of him . He was unable to write his name and therefore unable to sign his edicts . Because of this he had a plate made of gold , perforated with the letters of his signature . He used this as a stencil and traced his initials through it . In this manner only was he able to sign his documents . The early French kings , it appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their monograms themselves . They had secretaries to perform this duty . There are in existence several rare old characters which bear the words " The King orders his monogram ( nominis karacter ) to be written under it . " And sure enough , there under it appears the King 's monogram , carefully sealed or stamped by the secretary . William I , the Norman Conqueror of England , made use of just such a device to sign his documents . The French kings invariably used black ink in the stamping or drawing of their monograms . The exception to this rule , however , is Charles the Bald who was not only King of France but Emperor of Germany . The documents of Germany he signed in vermilion , and they were countersigned in black by the Chancellor . The Saxon kings not only signed with a monogram , but added a cross to make their signatures still more sacred . One writer tells us that they diluted the ink with the wine of the Eucharist . During the 15th and 16th centuries the use of monograms became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trademarks . They found their way into social life and were used on stationery . " Monograms came to mean to the middle classes what the coat-of-arms meant to nobility . " There are many examples of 16th-century monograms in existence . They are interesting and beautiful . They are based , with few exceptions , upon Gothic forms ; some are grotesque , some indistinct and scarcely readable , some charming and truly artistic . // Crests are quite as old as monograms . But while monograms developed largely because of the illiteracy of persons whose signatures were important , crests grew out of vanity and the love of symbols . From the earliest times men have used emblems to indicate their nationality . The Egyptians carried images of bulls and crocodiles into battle . Each of the twelve tribes of Israel had its special ensign . The Indians of British Columbia had crests of their totem poles , usually in the form of a frog , or wolf , or eagle . The subjects of Demiramis adopted doves and pigeons as their emblems . They selected the dove in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Athens used , as its public sign , an owl . This was a compliment to Minerva . Carthage used a horse 's head ; Corinth , a winged horse ; Persia , the sun ; Rome , an eagle . All peoples appear to have used some sign , some symbol , to distinguish themselves from others . These symbols were the original crests . As a form of ostentation and vanity , the crest is quickly falling into disuse , except with royalty . The monogram , however , is still in good taste and may be used on social stationery . To quote " The Book of Etiquette " : The monogram should be decorative without being elaborate . It should be placed in the centre at the top of the page when no address is given . It should be omitted entirely when the address appears at the top of the page . The space occupied by a monogram should not cover more than the approximate circumference of a silver dime . A monogram is usually stamped in black , dark green , or dark blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stationery to-day bears simply the address engraved in Gothic or Roman lettering in the upper centre of note and letter sheets and on the reverse side of the envelope . CHAPTER XI CALLING CUSTOMS Let us respect the ancient manners and recollect that , if the true soul of chivalry has died among us , with it all that is good in society has died . ? GLADSTONE . Since custom is the principal magistrate of man 's life , let men by all means endeavour to obtain good customs . ? LORD BACON . HOW CALLS ORIGINATED J N early life there could have been no regular visiting , no established calling customs . The condition of life would have been too uncertain , too hazardous , for any such thing . Mankind must have been fairly well advanced in the social scale before the idea of visiting his neighbours even occurred to him . At first he would have been suspicious and distrustful of any attempts toward friendliness . He would have avoided his neighbours as they avoided him . He would have been satisfied simply with his cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , his woman for companionship . The first primitive existence must have been absolutely devoid of any sort of social element . But as we follow in the footsteps of man , painfully and slowly developing , we see that it was by a series of very natural steps that the custom of calling grew in his life . With the use of spears and flint implements to kill beasts , man was able to supply himself with an abundance of food . With his cave well filled with food he was not afraid to welcome some wandering fellow and sit with him under the stars . His attitude toward his neighbours changed . He had plenty of food and they had plenty of food . Why need they fear one another ? 308 // And so we find them joining one another as they sit silently before the fire . First it would be just one fellow , coming over timidly and making known by gesture his desire to be friendly . Then another would wander close in his loneliness . They would discover that it was good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright ; the stars winked like thousands of tiny eyes ; the trees whispered softly , and far away some beast howled to the sky . Man moved closer . Like called out to like , and a slumbering social instinct was awakened . Then came speech and its great influence upon the life of man . Speech meant cooperation . It meant exchange of thoughts and experiences . It meant binding together of man to man in the common desire to express hopes , joys , sorrows , fears . It meant a great impetus to the social instinct . Story-tellers and myth-makers followed in the wake of speech . And there evolved the need for an audience . And so it continued through long ages of development , one custom growing up out of another , mankind gradually being drawn closer and closer in a social fabric that has patterned itself with all the human instincts . Not the least of these instincts is the desire to be respected and admired by one 's neighbours , to be a person of worth and importance . Out of this instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonious calls . The First Calls. ? It is always at a point like this that fancy tempts us , and we feel strongly the urge to wander along forgotten ways and poke curiously into the unknown . Could not some primitive mother have called upon a neighbour mother to show her round , fat baby ? Could not some savage youth , ages and ages ago , have called upon some other youth to match his skill and strength ? Visits , we are told , began among the ancient Israelites . The rabbis visited one another constantly for the purpose of sharing their wisdom . And they visited the people to teach , to comfort the sick , to console the bereaved . They // wandered among the Egyptians with their custom of mak-ing calls , and the Egyptians copied the fashion . But even before this time , which , after all , was a period of early civilization , men were making calls upon one an-other ; but these calls were intrinsically of a homage-paying nature . As has been noted in a previous chapter , early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man , the tribal gods , the kings , to win their approval and hence their protection ( see pp. 270-271 ) . Making a gift necessarily meant going to the person for whom it was intended . We can see how , by association , the very act of coming came to be looked upon as a mark of homage and respect . Eventually it would have acquired the character of a reverential ceremony , and a man would call upon a supe-rior for the same reason that he presented him with gifts . The early tribesman , for instance , would have come personally with his gift for the tribal chief , to see that he received it and no one else . Gradually it would have become the established or traditional custom in the tribe to call upon the chief at stated , definite intervals , to do him homage . We saw how presents which were once voluntary and entirely one-sided gradually became obligatory and recip-rocal ( see p. 273 ) . In the same manner the custom of ceremonious visiting became gradually obligatory and re-ciprocal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reverential type of visiting there was developing an entirely different kind of visiting which had nothing whatever to do with homage . It concerned mar-riage bargains and the settlement of marriage prices . Thus , when a man had a daughter for whom he wished to receive a dozen or so of his neighbour 's pigs , he called upon the neighbour and indicated to him his willingness to make the exchange . If the neighbour were agreeable , the bride price was settled and the marriage celebration planned . Or , if a man had a son of marriageable age he probably called upon his neighbour and discussed with him the benefits to be derived from a union between that son and the neighbour 's daughter . The custom of calling grew out of such natural steps as these in the development of man . When it became necessary to call upon his neighbour , he called upon him . When there was absolutely no reason for calling , he did n't . IVisits between Kin. ? Possibly the first visits made for the purpose of the simple pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can imagine a young bride returning to her own clan or tribe to visit her mother . We can imagine the mother visiting her son who lives with his wife in another hut . These visits would not have been ceremonious in the least . They would have been simple calls for the sake of seeing the person from whom one has been separated . Yet we can see how , out of this custom of calling upon kin , grew the more general custom of visiting one 's friends and neighbours . Perhaps two old mothers , whose children were all married and far away , called upon each other frequently to find sympathy and solace in each other 's company . Perhaps two old men , no longer able to fight or work , called upon each other to relate brave tales of their youth , of their lost strength , of their one-time skill in the hunt . This form of simple , unceremonious visiting between kin and between friends , gradually exerted its influence upon peoples everywhere . It found a foothold for itself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since . We call it the " informal call . " But it means simply the friendly little visit that one neighbour makes upon another . Caste , and Calling Customs. ? It is inevitable that caste should have entered the custom of calling at an early period . One tribal chief would feel that the other ought to call upon him first . One class of people would feel that // another class ought to do them homage . It has always been so , for man has always been conceited . In early life conquered chiefs were obliged to do homage to the new chief . When we read of a certain conquered people of ancient Peru , for instance , we notice that the chiefs were " ordered to reside at the court of Cuzco during certain months of the year . " This was regarded as a fitting way to do homage . You remember the story of Charlemagne . He not only forced subject kings to remain in his presence and so indicate their subservience to him , but he actually forced them to serve him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make periodical visits to their suzerains , to show their subjugation to them . The suzerains , in turn , were obliged to make visits to the lords . And the lords were obliged to do homage to the king . So was visiting a method of showing respect and homage between the castes . Where caste exists , visiting becomes ceremonious . It can not be the friendly or " informal " visiting that exists among equals . Thus caste affects the calling customs of many countries . In the Orient , where there are many castes , " ceremonial visits are regulated with great precision . " The same is true in India . In England there were at one time about fifty classes or castes of people before reaching the commoner , and the visits of all these castes were carefully regulated . In France and in Spain matters of precedence relating to diplomatic calls at court appear to have been of great moment and sometimes occasioned actual battles ( see p. 109 ) . We have not escaped , even to-day , the influence of caste in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , asking a new acquaintance to call ? " The Book of Etiquette " says : You can not , except under special conditions , invite people to your home unless you have called on them in formal manner and they have returned the visit . A young woman , and an unmarried woman , wait for an invitation to call from an older woman and matron . It // is not advisable for a young woman to ask a gentleman to call until she has met him several times . . . . A married woman does not leave a card for an unmarried man . . . . It is expected of a young matron or of a debutante that she request being permitted to call upon an elderly matron or an old lady after the two have met at a watering-place or in the home of a mutual friend , and after having exchanged cards , etc. , etc . Then there is the matter of the first call which " is often a very delicate matter . Frequently sensitive people are offended by some unconscious slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that an unmarried woman must always pay the first call of the season upon a matron . The bride does not make the first call , but waits until her friends and neighbours have called upon her . The elder of two women is always entitled to the first visit . Rules such as these , which are to be found in every book on etiquette , prove without a vestige of a doubt that caste consciousness still exists among us , although in greatly modified form . Calls of Condolence and Congratulation. ? We can not be certain when the custom of making calls upon friends or neighbours for the purpose of sympathizing with them or congratulating them originated . The custom is very probably an old one . We know that in ancient Greece neighbours and friends gathered together on the tenth day after the birth of a child to congratulate the parents and present gifts . Other peoples must have had similar customs . That calls of condolence are of great antiquity we can be reasonably certain . In the face of death we are all afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those who have felt death 's hand . Calls of condolence existed in ancient China . Confucius says : Generally guests who come to condole are first saluted by kneeling toward them and knocking the head on the ground to manifest one 's grief . However , the process of knocking the head on the ground before bowing to the guests is a more expressive manner of showing // grief , and I prefer the latter way in cases where mourning lasts for three years . In China to-day condoling visitors bring mock money which is buried with the dead . There are elaborate funeral repasts , attended by relatives and friends . Among the Irish it has for generations been the custom to call at the home of death and sit for hours with the bereaved . There arc drinking , feasting and chatting , for all the world as though it were a social function . Civilization brings understanding and kindliness , and to-day " when the call of condolence is made ten days or two weeks after the funeral , the intimate friends of the family should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The call should be brief . It is poor form to remain longer than fifteen minutes unless one is a particularly intimate friend . " The Ceremonious Calls of Modern Life. ? The ceremonious call is quickly becoming obsolete . With the minuet and the high handshake , it belongs to yesterday . But distinct traces of the ceremonious type of visiting still prevail and are to be found in our modern life . The " at-home " day , for instance , is a survival . There was a time when fashionable districts of New York were divided into regular sections wherein on a given day in the week a whole neighbourhood was " at home . " Ladies in visiting dress , with trains and bonnets and tight gloves , carrying card cases , tripped into this house , out of that , and again into another . During the heydey of the " at-home " call , huge quantities of visiting cards were left at every house . The number of cards was regulated with precision and care . These calls were not based upon civility or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ceremony . Both card-leaving and the " at home " are to-day practically obsolete , though our so-called " duty calls " are a survival . For instance , two weeks after having been entertained at a formal dinner one is expected to call and leave cards . When one is notified of a death , one is expected // to call and leave cards . A bride in a new neighbourhood expects her neighbours to call and leave cards . Every book on etiquette has a list of these obligatory calls . They can not very well be regarded as friendly or informal ; they are more or less ceremonious . The morning call was at one time a very popular social institution . It appears to have been a remote but distinct sequence of that system under which subordinates were required to call from time to time and show loyalty to their superiors . It existed principally in court systems under which courtiers were required to present themselves at stated intervals to do homage to the king . In the 17th century , for instance , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are obliged , under a considerable penalty , to come twice every day to salute the King in the assembly , once about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning when he renders justice ; and the second time about six hours at night . The morning call , which is now practically obsolete , but which still exists in Washington and in certain small towns , appears to be a survival . Persons of lesser rank in the social scheme call upon their superiors before noon any day except Sunday , and leave cards to show they have been there . It is another way of " doing homage . " In the United States caste consciousness is not as pronounced as it is abroad , and the call is a social pleasure rather than a social device . The only calls that still carry with them a flavour of ceremoniousness are those previously enumerated , concerning condolence , congratulation , inquiry , etc . The Informal Call. ? During the early periods of Christianity it was the custom of neighbours to call upon one another at Christmas , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " everyone called upon everyone else " exchanging the good wishes of the season . When the Dutch came to settle in New York they brought with them the custom of making friendly , informal // New Year calls . This custom has remained with us , and to-day the New Year call is usually one of the jolliest and most delightful of the season . ' When visitors call informally it is customary to serve refreshments of some sort . Usually tea and cake are served to callers in the afternoon . In Manila native fruits are offered the visitor . In New Mexico the customary refreshment , when they are in season , is pinon nuts . In Sicily liquor is served the guest . The phrase for hospitality in the Society and Sandwich Islands is , " Let us eat together . " These people are most hospitable and they will share their last bit of food with a guest . In Japan calls are usually made in the morning . Dainties are served to the guests on white paper ? confectionery and little cakes , ordinarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not eat the visitor carefully folds in the paper and deposits in his pocket sleeve to carry away with him . Among most peoples , eating together is the greatest sign of hospitality , and to refuse to eat with a host is regarded as a serious insult . Among us , a hostess dislikes to be refused the cup of tea or the dainties she offers . " The Book of Etiquette " is partial to the friendly informal call and recommends it to those who want to entertain simply and unostentatiously . It says in part : If you feel that , because you are not fortunate enough to own a pretentious dwelling and to hire impressive butlers and maidservants to welcome your guests , you should not make calls and have them returned , you are depriving yourself of a pleasure infinitely greater than all elaborate display and ostentation . Simple , informal calls made for the purpose of creating and developing friendships , and made with a feeling of genuine cordiality and friendliness , are even more gratifying than the stiffly formal social calls . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you neglect your friendships merely because your home and facilities do not warrant extensive social intercourse . True etiquette is universal in its appeal and reaches the country woman in her little cottage as directly as it reaches the stately dowager in her city mansion . // Origin of the Visiting Card. ? Early peoples , calling upon one another , always felt that it was polite to announce their arrival beforehand . They felt that the owners ought to be warned of their approach . We can see the origin of this , of course . Earlier in the stage of social development , when one tribe approached another it would not know at first whether the approach were hostile or friendly . But if that tribe announced its approach , it must naturally be friendly . Otherwise it would approach silently , secretly , to steal upon them un318 THE CUSTOMS OF MANKIND awares . Through obvious association , it became a form of early politeness to make known one 's approach . Thus in Australia , before coming within a mile of the fires of the natives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by loud " cooeys . " In other sections of Australia it is the custom , when one tribe approaches another in peace , to carry burning sticks . A Blackfellow would not think of breaking in suddenly upon the privacy of the horde he is about to visit . He warns them of his arrival by building a fire a little distance off . Several peoples , in widely separated parts of the world , use this method of making known their approach . Among the ancient Israelites it was considered good form , when visiting friends or strangers , to send a servant ahead to announce their coming . This corresponds to our custom of sending a card or note several days in advance when we are planning to visit someone and we wish him or her to be at home . It was not until the late 17th and early 18th centuries that the visiting card , as we know it , came into general use . Its development appears to be most marked in France , as are , indeed , most social developments . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists and designers devoting themselves entirely to the creating of visiting cards for the fashionable world . Many of the elaborate visiting cards of this period are still in existence . We have seen one , for instance , decorated with a wreath of roses bordered with olives and bearing the name " Marquis de Llano . " The decorations were made by the artist Raphael Mengs . Another card bears the picture of a spaniel holding a miniature card in his mouth on which appears the name " Adam Bartsch " ( celebrated author of the " Peintre Graveur , " a work published at Venice in twenty-one volumes ) . Another one of his cards reveals a savage dog tearing a roll of paper which bears the date 1795 . Beneath it is the legend : " Adam Bartsch has the pleasure of preCALLING // senting his compliments and good wishes for the New Year . " Ornamented cards such as these were used for various purposes . They were sent with gifts . They were left at homes to show that the owners had been there . Invitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cards ornamented to harmonize with their professions . Thus the architect Blondel had his name inscribed above the cornice of a ruined monument ; an artist had a palette on his card ; the landscape gardener , a bit of pretty landscape . After a period of great ostentation in cards , the pendulum seems to have swung to the other extreme . During the late 18th and 19th centuries , ordinary playing cards were used and the names were written in pen or pencil on the back . Several such cards , of about the period of 1850 , were found in a house in Dean Street , Soho , under repair . One of them bears the name of Isaac Newton . As they proved useful and convenient in the matter of visiting cards , the playing cards were next used for invitations . Invitations to dinners and parties were scribbled on their backs . But toward the close of the 19th century such social carelessness was frowned upon , and the simple pasteboard card which we know came into favour . Our custom of using white cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese . They have used cards of various kinds from a very early period . And they have been among the first to use a different colour to indicate mourning . The Chinese visiting card is a strip of vermilion paper printed in black . For mourning purposes the paper is white printed in dark blue . The formula on the Chinese visiting card is as ornate as its appearance . The card bears not only the name of the visitor , but an address of respect to the host . One card , to give an example , bears this inscription : The tender and sincere friend of your Lordship , and the perpetual // disciple of your doctrine , presents himself in this quality to pay his duty and make his reverence even to the earth . The correct card of to-day is engraved with the name only , or with the name and address . To be absolutely correct it is pure white engraved in black . Cards for mourning are white edged with a narrow border of black . ( See pp. 588-589 for the origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a long trip to some distant place , it is customary to call upon one 's friends , not for the purpose of making a visit , but merely to leave one 's visiting card on which one has written in one corner the letters P.

The card is purely a courtesy card , to inform one 's friends of one 's departure , and no acknowledgment is necessary . CHAPTER XII HOSPITALITY AND ENTERTAINMENT And when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field , neither shalt thou gather up the gleanings of thy harvest . And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard , and the single grapes that drop in thy vineyard shalt thou not gather up . For the poor and the stranger shalt thou leave them . I am the Lord thy God . - LEVITICUS XVII I , 9 . THE CORNERSTONE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame , long life and heavenly bliss , " says Manu , the maxim-maker . As we ride back across the ages , peering here into a palace , there into a hovel , sometimes into a cave on the hillside , sometimes into a tent on the edge of a desert , we are inclined to shout , " You are right , old Manu ! " Wherever history traces the tale of hospitality , there too it traces the tale of man 's greatest development . Hospitality appears to be one of the cornerstones upon which the city of civilization has been built . Of course , there was no hospitality when mankind was young , when life was lived from day to day with no thought of a past or a future . All that mattered was to-day ? food and shelter and comfort for the one little life from dawn to dark . But hospitality came early into the life of man . When food was scarce , man ate furtively and alone in some corner ; but when it was plentiful , he shared . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of vanity than from any feeling of generosity . The man who killed the ox or the bear was proud of his achievement . Here was food , good food . Come and taste of it . 321 // He had killed it . He had made this food possible . And he felt , as he strode around the spot watching the others timidly tear bits of the beast away , that he was superior to them , that they were obligated to him . We trace the same sort of personal vanity and pride in the great feasts given by tribal chiefs and kings . It gave them a sense of power and importance to gather people around them and give them food . The chief who could feast fifty tribesmen felt mighty . No one else could feed fifty men . No one else had so much food , so many good things . And hence , no one else was so powerful , so important . It is not difficult to parallel this in modern life . The fashionable hostess strives to give the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given , frequently , not out of any mistaken sense of generosity but because the host and hostess like to feel that they can give magnificent dinners . Yet in early life it was just this sort of selfish vanity that aroused in man the first slight inclination toward hospitality . He found a peculiar new kind of pleasure in sharing , in being generous . It was probably different from any instinct he had ever sensed before . He felt warm and comfortable as his friends came from all around to share in his kill . Good people . They honoured him . They respected him . And there was plenty of meat for all ! So he played generous host , and the part pleased him . It has pleased king and vassal , lord and peasant , duke and commoner in all the ages between . There is no satisfaction that can be likened to the satisfaction of giving . And so hospitality came into the darkness of early times and helped to broaden the shaft of light that already indicated the path of human progress and development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach a higher and better place for itself . It became a cornerstone which mankind used in building the foundation for civilization . // Relationship of Food to Hospitality. ? Like a deep-sea pearl , hospitality has taken on many rich and beautiful hues . But in early life hospitality meant just one thing ? sharing your food with your neighbour or with a stranger . Later it meant sharing your sleeping place with him , giving him shelter and protection for the night . But the hospitality that threw open the hut or the tent to the stranger was delayed until mankind could be sure that not every stranger who approached was an enemy , that not every wanderer was an evil spirit . Among almost all savage tribes , once you have broken bread with a man or taken a drink with him you are considered on peaceful terms with him . You are under obligations to protect him if he is in danger ; he will protect you if you are in danger . This act of hospitality , of eating together , is a tie that binds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leti , Moa , and Lakor friendship is expressed by eating together . In Sumatra the guest is presented with betel ( a nut which when chewed makes the teeth black ) in token of friendliness . In Java a superior pays the inferior a high compliment if he offers his halfchewed betel . From the earliest times , eating and drinking together has been a tie of relationship . Writers like to call it food kinship . It was widely prevalent and was usually of a ceremonious nature . This food kinship was an elementary form of hospitality ; it exists to-day in various modified forms . Its influence can be traced even in modern hospitality . The traveller among savage peoples finds that many of them have actual formula for hospitality based upon the old principles of food kinship . The Tahitian formula for hospitality is " Haere ma'i to maha " ( Come and eat with us ) . Among the Koniagas visitors are presented with a cup of water as a ceremonial mark of friendship and the customary phrase is , " Let us be friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea or refreshments of some sort to the visitor . We know that in modern life the refusal of food or drink is not always taken in good grace . It is considered an act of common politeness to accept it , whether one wants it or not . This , too , appears to be a survival . Among the Bedouin Arabs it has , from the very earliest times , been considered a serious breach of etiquette to ride up to the front of a man 's tent without stopping and eating his bread . According to the code of manners prevalent among the Arabs , the man in the tent has reason to consider himself insulted , and hence an enemy of the other . Among the Iroquois the regular act of courtesy and friendliness toward a visitor was to present him with a dish of hominy . To refuse it would be a great breach of courtesy and would cause instant enmity . In Sumatra a similar custom prevails . The guest is offered betel and he must accept it whether he likes or not . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To the primitive mind , eating together produced identity of substance , of flesh . Therefore those who ate together were kin . ( See p. 250 ) . And therefore those who ate together were friendly toward each other , on peaceful terms . Through association of ideas , eating together became inseparably linked with hospitality . Among the North American Indians , tobacco-smoking took over all the ideas attached to food in primitive life . Just as eating and drinking together was one of the earliest ties of relationship among the peoples of early times , passing around the calumet became the regular custom of making peace and alliances , of indicating friendliness and hospitality , among the Indians . You know how , in modern life , a man does not light his cigar or cigarette until he has first asked his companions to join him . So through the ages hospitality has always associated itself with the act of eating and drinking together , or , as in the case of the Indians , smoking together . We , too , // show our hospitality by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinners . Early Hospitality. ? It seems that hospitality , in early life , found expression in great feasting . Tribal chiefs gave great feasts in honour of some important event or to do homage to a visiting chief . The Greeks and Romans gave great banquets to which they invited everyone of importance . The Israelites had a simpler hospitality , but they too gave great feasts . And we know that the Egyptians always feasted in great halls , offering food to their gods before they themselves touched a morsel . There is no doubt whatever that the Israelites were a hospitable people , and that others emulated their customs of hospitality . And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land , ye shall not vex him . As one born in the land among you , shall be unto you the stranger that sojourneth with you , and thou shalt love him as thyself ; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt . ( Leviticus XIX , 33 , 34 . ) We know from Homer 's Iliad that the Greeks were great entertainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It appears that the Greeks gave feasts to celebrate all important events in their lives ? births , marriages , holidays , victories in warfare ; and practically everyone was invited . The Roman feasts were greater than any , because they had the food products which enabled them to give great feasts . What they lacked they usually sent for , and their messengers went far and wide to obtain choice fruits and viands . The Romans were noted for their hospitality . Nothing was too rich or too costly for the entertainment of their guests . They had elaborate tables , beautiful ewers and drinking vessels . They appear to have been highly advanced in the art of entertaining . The Egyptians of 4000 years ago were fond of dinnergiving as a form of entertainment . We are told that their dinners lasted several hours , and that both men and women // were invited , which was an unusual thing . In early life women did not usually attend feasts or dinners with the men . Dining couches and small tables were provided , and the guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wine . During the progress of the meal household slaves stood behind the guests waving ostrich plumes . This luxurious type of hospitality and entertainment lasted for many generations among those people who could afford it . The lower classes knew no hospitality in the sense of feasting . They shared their bread when they had bread . They celebrated their marriages and births as best they could . But they were too vitally concerned with the business of living to develop among themselves the art of hospitality . It would appear that for a long time there were only two great classes ? the wealthy and the powerful who entertained lavishly ; and the toiling classes who knew only the simple kind of hospitality that comes from the heart . With the coming of Christianity there was a great impetus toward simple , unostentatious hospitality . Christ preached against luxury and display . He taught simple kindliness and generosity . Feasting and lavish entertaining continued unabated among those who were accustomed to it , but something seemed to have happened in the lives of the people . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made its influence very definitely felt , // It became the custom to " share one 's bread with the stranger at the gate . " Hospitality was extended for the sole purpose of being hospitable , and not because of vanity or the desire to impress . Among the early European peoples simple hospitality took a firm hold . The Anglo-Saxons " invited all the countryside " to the wedding feast , to the celebration . The French shared wine and bread at the tavern , and helped one another make merry . In Spain , in Italy , in Germany , in Russia , wherever we wander , we find traces of the new kind of hospitality that had marched , like some pioneer , at the head of Christianity . Hospitality is such a vast subject , it has so many beautiful threads that reach out across the tapestry of life , that we can not do justice to it in a book of this nature . Perhaps some day someone will write of hospitality alone , and tell of its great and far-reaching influences upon civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the briefest kind of outline . We let our eyes rest but for a moment upon the beautiful design it traces on the tapestry , and then ? on again to mankind , its habits , its customs , its instincts , its manners ! fi Curious Custom of Hospitality. ? A widespread custom of hospitality in early savage life , and a custom still prevalent in various spots throughout the uncivilized world , is that of " lending " the wife to the visitor ( see p. 264 ) . The Eskimo , the Australian aborigines , and almost all South Sea Islanders still practise this age-old custom , regarding it as one of the most essential duties of the hospitable host . This sexual hospitality has its parallels in modern life , in highly modified form , of course . The books on etiquette tell us , for instance , that " the hospitable host mingles with his wife 's guests and tries to make them feel at home . ' " When going in to dinner " the host does not offer his arm to his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters on the arm of the most important man guest . " On the golf links or // tennis courts the hostess who plays well should not join her husband but " play with the man she feels will be most pleased to have her . " Modern life abounds with just such laws of hospitality as these . We do not realize , as we observe them , that their origins lie buried in the dim past of yesterday . Possible Origin of the Guest Book. ? Browsing for a while in old Egypt , we stumble across an old custom which is startlingly like a custom observed to-day . // It seems that it was customary for all important guests at the Pharaoh 's palace to have their names and symbols engraved on the " guest wall . " This was accounted a high honour . Modern guests inscribe their names in the guest book . The more fashionable and important the hostess , the more honourable the guest accounts it to inscribe his name in the book . One can not fail to see the strange similarity between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization . The Favoured Guest. ? It has always been the custom to show deference to the favoured ? that is , the most important ? guest . In savage feasts the most important guest sits at the right of the chief . When Europe was young , the favoured guest always sat at the right of the host , at feasts , and was helped to the choicest joints , the rarest fruits , the costliest wines . It seems that there have always been methods of showing deference to the favoured guests , even in the earliest times . Among the Romans there was one place at the head of the table reserved for the host , the hostess , and one guest of honour . Among the Egyptians the highest in rank sat with the host at the head of the table . Among the Greeks the highest in rank had their hands washed first , the lowest in rank last . With us , " The host leads into the dining-room with the lady who is to sit at his right . If the dinner is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dinner with the wife of the honoured guest ; the hostess goes in with that lady 's husband . " We see here the same inclination to show deference to the guest of honour by extending to him , or her , the place of importance at the table . The Arabs welcomed their guests by pouring melted butter on their heads , to refresh them . The Greeks instantly showed their guests to the public baths . The Egyptians anointed their guests with oil upon their arrival . With us , as soon as the house-party guest arrives , " he is // shown to his room and not disturbed until he has rested and refreshed himself . " Among the Ainu the guest is always given the most honourable and comfortable seat ? the east or sacred end of the hearth . In Persia the guest is given the favourite sadr or floor space opposite the door end of the room . It is customary , among modern civilized peoples , to offer the most comfortable spot and the most comfortable chair to the guest . We often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourite seat , because it is more comfortable than any other . " It is the height of rudeness for any one to go to an entertainment given in honour of someone and fail to meet him . " We quote from a recent book on etiquette . This custom of " meeting " the guest of honour is not very different , fundamentally , from the custom that existed in ancient times . Each guest at the chief 's feast , or the king 's magnificent banquet , was obliged to kneel down before him and pay him homage . The " Bread-and-Butter " Letter . When a traveller arrives at a village in Arabia , the sheik or chief sends him perhaps a present of milk and bread and fruits , begging him to accept it as a mark of his hospitality . The stranger receives it , but before he leaves the place he is sure to be visited by the chief in person , and then the traveller is expected to make him some present in return for what he has received . Not a word is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a breach of the laws of hospitality ; but the traveller , if he has been long in the country , knows quite well the object of the visit , and if he is wise , will make the sheik such a present as will satisfy him . If he does not , he may find after he has left the place that something has been stolen from him ; or he may , perhaps , be waylaid and robbed by some persons employed by the very man who has entertained him . ( From " Customs of the Bedouin Arabs , " pg . 83 ) A brief survey of the customs of hospitality of various peoples indicates the prevalence of just such customs as these . All peoples appear to have some mode of showing gratitude for hospitality received . The Awemba send a gift to the person who has entertained them . The prince // of Congo dedicates one of his wives to the tutelary god of his host . The Andaman Islander , to indicate his gratitude , asks to be given one of the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among us the " bread-and-butter " letter is sent to the hostess . This is simply a grateful expression of appreciation for the hospitality enjoyed during one 's stay at the home of the hostess . It derives its name from the idea of eating " the bread and butter " of the hostess ' home , and has become acceptable through constant usage . The " bread and butter " letter is written only when one has been a guest at a house party . One is expected to write it within ten days after departure . ' We are cautioned to write the letter promptly , for " it would be gross neglect to fail in so obvious a duty . " A typical " bread-and-butter " letter is reproduced herewith : TERRACE REVAIN , June 23 , 19- . DEAR MRS . BEVANS : This is to tell you again how very much I enjoyed the week-end at Pine Rock . We got into the city at five and Morgan brought me out home in a taxi . Mother is giving a small bridge this afternoon and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal to do it is impossible to get any one to help do it . Tell Mr. Bevans that I am arranging for three or four tennis games next week , so that when I come again , if I do n't win , I shall at least not be beaten quite so shamefully . Let me know when you come to town on your next shopping trip . Perhaps we can arrange for lunch together somewhere . Very sincerely yours , HELEN R. JANIS . This is simply the polished , 20th-century way of saying that one is grateful for hospitality received , and that one hopes at some future day to repay it . Concerning Precedence. ? Matters of precedence have always been of great importance . We have seen how simple matters of precedence have occasioned diplomatic battles ( see p. 109 ) , and if we could glimpse behind the // pages of history , we would see that such matters have actually precipitated wars . With us a guest is expected to go through a doorway first . The host holds back saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture that he wishes the guest to enter before him . But among the Chinese , the guest is supposed to refuse firmly to enter before the host and then enter with him . This is a custom of politeness very sacred to the Chinese . The host who invites his guest to enter first would consider it an insult if the guest actually did so . Thus they go through the little ceremony of refusal and of entering together . In Arabia the host remains outside while the guest enters . He acts as a sort of " lookout " for enemies . When all seems safe and sound , he too enters the tent . The Comanche host is offended if the guest does not enter first and take the place pointed out to him . This custom appears to exist among many peoples . Perhaps it originated in the fear of the guest to enter first ? fear that the host was not friendly and might do him harm when his back was turned . If this is true , entering first would be a form of politeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his absolute trust of the host . Announcing One 's Arrival. ? The Blackfellow , about to visit a neighbouring horde , pauses while he is yet some distance off and builds a fire . This fire is supposed to warn the people of his coming . After a few moments he rises , approaches the horde , and when he is outside of the camp and within sight of everyone , he sits down . He does not enter or mingle with the people until he has been invited in by the chief or someone of importance . Throughout the Orient it is considered a form of simple politeness to send a servant ahead to announce one 's coming . A quarter of a mile or so distance from an encampment which he is planning to visit , a Veddah stops and shouts . // He continues shouting and does not proceed until an answering shout is heard . Many similar customs exist all over the world . It has always been regarded as polite to warn of one 's arrival . Even savage peoples consider it a great discourtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we knock on the door , ring a bell , or send in our card , as the case may be . The Ceremonious Leave-Taking . " The Book of Etiquette " says : The guest must seek out the host and hostess and thank them cordially for their hospitality . It is customary to shake hands upon taking leave . The custom of taking ceremonious leave of one 's host is an old one . In the Andaman Islands it has been for generations the custom to blow into the host 's hand when leaving . One writer gives the following dialogue between a host and guest among these half-savage people : GUEST : Indeed I go . HosT : Very well , go ; when will you come again ? GUEST : I will bring away something for you one of these days . HosT : May no snake bite you ! GUEST : I will be watchful . Then they blow into each other 's hands and part , shouting promises , cautions , and invitations until beyond earshot . Some partings are no less brief to-day ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and used it as frequently as we use our custom of hand-shaking . The Blackfellow to-day always blows upon his host 's hands when he wishes to make known his intention of leaving . If the host is satisfied to let his guest depart , he blows upon the guest 's hand in return . If not , he merely shakes his head and draws back his hand , and the guest extends his visit . But to-day , " It is not civil or courteous to attempt to prolong . the presence of any guest after he has made known // his desire to leave . " And instead of being ceremonious , lengthy , and stilted , the leave-taking is brief , cordial . TI-IE INDIAN ? PIONEER OF AMERICAN HOSPITALITY Curiously enough , the North American Indians have always been highly advanced in the art of hospitality . While they were yet in a state of savagery they had customs of hospitality which were an inspiration to the white people who first came among them . We must recognize the North American Indians as a race highly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages the Indians were forced to remain savages because lack of metals made it difficult for them to battle with the forest . How could they clear the land for agriculture with only a stone ax for tool ? As Widney says : Any one who has helped , even with the steel implements of an advanced civilzation , to hew out a home amid the beech woods of Ohio will realize the almost hopeless struggle which would lie before a savage race making its first start with stone ax and sharpened stick towards subduing a densely wooded land . So the Indians slipped behind in the march of progress and civilization , as we regard progress in the sense of material things ; but in many of their manners and customs they were amazingly advanced . A study of the American Indians can not fail to impress you with the hospitality which characterized their daily life . Few people were as open-hearted and generous as they . Their unaffected kindness and their willingness to share a last morsel astonished the early white settlers who came into contact with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as recorded by these early white people , are touching . In the summer of 1584 an expedition under the auspices of Sir Walter Raleigh landed on the island of Wocoken , off Albemarle Sound . They invaded the land of the Algonquin tribes and made themselves comfortable . // Yet " there came down from all parts great stores of people " bringing ducks , hares , fish , fruits , nuts , and many good things for the newcomers . The wife of the chief , Granganimeo , came personally and invited the two leaders of the expedition ( Philip Amidas and Arthur Barlow ) into the house . She washed them , gave them every comfort , " and served roasted fish and venison on a board that stood along the side of the house . " In 1525 Cortes , the Spanish explorer , visited an island in Lake Peten where he was lavishly entertained by the chief of the tribe , Canec . Cortes reports that they " sat down to a dinner in stately manner and Canec ordered fowls , fish , cakes , honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis and Clark expedition , wrote with enthusiasm of the hospitality which he encountered . He told how the Indians of the Columbia Valley boiled salmon and served it on a platter of rushes , neatly made . " It is the custom of all the nations on the Missouri to offer every white man food and refreshments when he first enters their tents . " And this despite the fact that the white man was stealing their land , cheating them of their possessions , ousting them from their homes ! This kind of generosity , this whole-souled and simple hospitality , can not be found among any other people , savage or civilized . We have borrowed many things from our Indian brothers , but nothing more valuable than their custom of generous hospitality . They paved the way for the hospitality which has become so peculiarly associated with this country . We owe them , as we owe all peoples of the world from whose manners and customs we have borrowed , a debt of gratitude . William Thomas dwells at some length upon the hospitality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people that we feel it is worth while to quote this passage which sums up , not only the hospitality of the Iroquois , but of all North American Indians : // Among the Iroquois , hospitality was an established usage . If a man entered an Indian house in any of their villages , whether a villager , a tribesman or a stranger , it was the duty of the women therein to set food before him . An omission to do this would have been a discourtesy amounting to an affront . If hungry , he ate . If not hungry , courtesy demanded that he should taste the food and thank the giver . This was repeated at every house he entered , and at whatever hour of the day . As a custom it was upheld by the rigorous public sentiment . The same hospitality was extended to strangers from their own and from other tribes . Upon the advent of the European race among them , it was also extended to them . This characteristic of barbarous society wherein food was the principal concern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as administered by the American aborigines , tended to the final equalization of subsistence . Hunger and destitution could not exist at one end of an Indian village , or in one section of an encampment , while plenty prevailed elsewhere in the same village or encampment . MODERN HOSPITALITY With a background , such as Thomas describes above , it is not strange that the early colonists should have acquired the habits of simple hospitality . They patterned themselves somewhat after the people on the other side of the ocean from whom they had escaped ; somewhat after the red people into whose midst they had come and who set them the eloquent example of simple and kindly hospitality . The early pages in the history of our country , darkened by the pathetic struggles of the colonists to master the conditions in which they found themselves , are brightened here and there by tales of jolly entertainments and generous hospitality . We read with quickening heart-beat of a pathetic little wedding feast in Plymouth . We read with a sudden warmth of tenderness of a Thanksgiving dinner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ westward and rejoice with the pioneers when they reach at last their destination and every man , woman , and child gladly helps in clearing the grounds for the great celebration . // Torn from their native homes , banished from their places of birth , alone in a strange new world , these pioneers were yet held together by the bond of hospitality . They were kind to one another , generous , hospitable . They shared alike the hardships and the pleasures of their experiences . And they built strong because they built together . In the centuries between , many conflicting influences have moulded themselves upon the American consciousness . Many customs and fashions have crossed the ocean and patterned themselves upon our lives . But we have never wholly lost that heritage bequeathed us by the early colonists ? a love of simple kindliness and hospitality , a love of sharing with our neighbours and having there share with us . Home Entertainments. ? In modern life , hospitable entertainment divides itself into two kinds . There are the formal entertainments on occasions of moment ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social clock . Formal entertainments include the large dinner , the ceremonious luncheon in honour of a visiting guest , the debutante tea , the elaborate garden party , the musicale , the debut dance , the costume ball . At one time the word " reception " included everything intended to be formal and ceremonious in the nature of entertainment . Whether a dance , a tea , a dinner or a garden party , it was known as a " reception . " But the " reception " went out during the reign of Queen Victoria , and now the word is used merely to indicate a public affair presided over by a committee . Informal entertainments include the simple dinner , the simple luncheon and afternoon tea , the card party ( unless it is very large and ceremonious ) , the simple dance , the supper , the Christmas , New Year , or birthday party . The bachelor dinner and the shower tea are invariably informal in nature . Wedding anniversaries are usually celebrated // in an informal manner , but the dinner which celebrates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Small. ? Dinner-giving as a form of entertainment is as old as ? well , as Methuselah , at least ! And we can imagine its going back very much farther , when some cave fellow , out of the goodness of his heart , invited one or two of his neighbours to join him in his feast . Since eating and drinking together appears to have been one of the earliest forms of hospitality ( see p. 324 ) dinner-giving must be included among the earliest forms of entertaining . Generations of culture separate the dinner-giving of early times from the dinner-giving of to-day . Let us glance for a moment at the early dinners and see what they were like . Early savages , we have seen , simply gathered about a huge fire and tore choice morsels of food from the roasted . bear or ox . The honoured guest sat to the right of the host , or the chief , and was given the very choicest bits . They ate until they could eat no more , and then slept side by side in stuffed exhaustion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and the guests ate from a common dish . Unlike the savage races of Australia and Africa , the red Indians did not stuff or gorge themselves , but ate only to satisfy their hunger . They feasted on occasions of importance , but even then with moderation . After the dinner , or the feasting , they entertained with dancing and pantomime , with feats of skill and strength . The Greeks and Romans were fond of dinner-giving . They were both surprisingly advanced , and they had elaborate table appointments . Guests were entertained with wrestling , races , feats of strength and daring . The Roman guests came with their servants and remained for several hours . They ate reclining on couches , gorging themselves with game and fruits and " washing down the food with huge draughts of wine . " // The Egyptians , we know , were fond of dinner-giving as a form of entertainment ( see p. 325 ) . Their dinners , like those of the Romans , lasted several hours , and the guests ate during most of that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly so rich and elaborate as those of the Romans ; and unlike most peoples of early times , the Egyptians invited both women and men to their entertainments . In the East guests not only were feasted but they were expected to carry away with them the food they were unable to consume . Among some Eastern peoples , if the guests did not carry away food with them it was regarded as a reflection upon the host 's generosity . Among us the hostess sometimes insists upon the favoured guest carrying away a piece of the birthday cake ; the country hostess frequently prevails upon her city guest to take away a jar of home-made preserves , some maple syrup , or some other city rarity . Women were usually barred from feasts and dinners in the East , but this was not true of the Japanese women . From the earliest times , their position was unlike that of any other women of the East . Their minds were cultivated as the men 's were . They were not secluded . And the result is that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Formal dinner-giving is one of the most difficult of all modern social entertainments in the home . It is not enough to set a well-appointed table , to serve a correct and delectable dinner . As Emily Post says : If the great world of society were a university which issued degrees to those whom it trains in its usages , the magna cum laude honours would be awarded without question , not to the hostess who may have given the most marvellous ball of the decade , but to her who knows best every component detail of preparation and service , no less than every inexorable rule of etiquette , in formal dinnergiving . The " groaning board " is a thing of the past . Hospitality is no longer judged in terms of over-stuffed larders. // No matter how formal a dinner may be , it should under no circumstances consist of more than a hors d'oeuvre , soup , fish , entree , roast , salad , dessert , and coffee . The dishes should be selected with a regard for balance ; there should be as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest list is as important as a wellbalanced menu . And after the right guests have been assembled , one must place them properly at the table . To quote from a recent book on etiquette : It is usually a mistake to invite great talkers together . Brilliant men and women who love to talk want hearers , not rivals . Very silent people should be sandwiched between good talkers , or at least voluble talkers . Silly people should never he put anywhere near learned ones , nor the dull near the clever , unless the dull one is a young and pretty woman with a talent for listening , and the clever , a man with an admiration for beauty and a love for talking . . . . The endeavour of a hostess , when seating her table , is to put those together who are likely to be interested in each other . Entertainment or amusement of some sort appears to have followed eating even in the earliest times . Greeks , Romans , Egyptians , all had dancing , games , or entertainments after dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious to note how modes of entertainment have changed , even as the mode of living has changed . The whim of the moment is to gather about the bridge tables as soon as dinner is concluded . Hostesses deliberately invite guests upon their qualifications as bridge players . Sometimes dancing follows the formal dinner ; sometimes a musicale . Frequently the guests gather in the drawing room for conversation . At large formal dinners , professionals are sometimes brought in to entertain with dancing or singing . The little dinner , or the simple , informal dinner , is quite a delightful social function . It has less of the dignity and elaborateness of the formal dinner , but more of a jolly , informal joyousness . It follows in the wake of Christmas and Thanksgiving . It conjures in one 's mind pictures of turkey and stuffed potatoes and all good things to eat . And // somehow , such impressive appointments as silver candle . sticks and finger bowls fade into nothingness ! The success of the small dinner depends very largely upon the hostess . She must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be ill at ease if she does not want her guests to be ill at ease . If she is jolly , calm , poised , happy ; if she is satisfied with things as they are and not disturbed because her home and her appointments are not elaborate ; if the food is well cooked and well served , the guests will vote the dinner a success . Origin and Evolution of the Afternoon Tea. ? George Eliot earnestly inquires , " Reader , have you ever drunk a cup of tea ? " There seems to be something peculiarly heart-warming in a fat , friendly teapot . And gossip over the steaming teacups can be most enjoyable , you know ! Perhaps that is why the afternoon tea has become so popular a form of feminine entertaining . We associate the afternoon tea with merry England . Pepys , in his much-quoted diary , records that he sent for a cup of tea ? " a China drink of which he had never drunk before " ? on the 25th of September , 1660 . Another writer tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the East India Company thought so much of it that they presented a few pounds to the King , regarding it as a gift worthy of his royal acceptance . Dr. Johnson declares that Earls Arlington and Ossory were the first to import tea into England in 1660 . Perplexed by these conflicting facts , we search the sources and find that it was a forgotten gentleman of Holland who introduced tea to the English . History never recorded his name . No one seems to know precisely who he was . But they know that he was a dreamy-eyed fellow who had lived long in the Orient , and who came to England at a very early date bringing with him a peculiar little leaf . To this curious leaf the dreamy-eyed Dutchman added hot water and sugar . And he drank . But England refused // to drink with him . They would have none of him and his funny hot drink , until one or two of the curious tasted it . Instantly those who tasted the tea were converted , and begged the stranger for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had with him . As is the way with imagination , the story spread that the drink from China contained drugs . And as is the way with human nature , everybody began tasting it ! It was good , this tea from China . England took notice . Great quantities of the leaves were imported . Nobility adopted the tea fad . At once , everyone followed suit . To drink tea was to be fashionable . So England drank . We do not know what clever English hostess first con-ceived the idea of the ceremonious afternoon tea . We presume that it followed closely upon the introduction of tea as a beverage . It would appear that fashionable host-esses took to serving tea to their guests in the afternoon ; and thus evolved the custom of the afternoon tea as we know it . To-day practically the whole world sits down to its cup of tea , and in the United States , as in England , clever hostesses entertain at the tea table . How to Entertain with Tea. ? The afternoon tea , in the sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is un-questionably an English institution . But the tea interpreted in the sense of social entertainment is largely of our own development . The ceremonious tea is given for a debutante daughter , for a son returning from college , for a visiting guest , for a noted celebrity . Refreshments are served in the dining room , instead of in the drawing room or on the lawn as at simpler teas . Trays of thinly sliced bread are on the table , and dainty sandwiches in large variety . Sometimes fruit salads are served ; sometimes cakes and bonbons . But the refreshments are never so substantial that they in-terfere with dinner . The fashionable tea for the debutante usually includes dancing . This same type of tea is given by a hostess to // introduce a new daughter-in-law to her circle of friends . The formal garden party is simply a ceremonious tea outof-doors . Simple teas are delightful . ' With her hissing tea urn and jolly conversation , the hostess makes each guest feel happy and at ease . The occasion carries no hint of formality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to see one 's friends and be seen by them , to enjoy a chat , and , if the truth be known , to show one 's new tea gown ! Somehow , drinking tea together seems to strengthen the bonds of friendship . Strangers who meet for the first time at the home of a mutual friend and sit down with her for the inevitable cup of tea feel themselves friends of long standing . It brings to mind the Ardras who , from earliest times , had the custom of drinking together as a sign of peace and friendship ; the Seminoles and their famous drink which establishes the tie of friendship ; the many other savage peoples of early times who drank together as a symbol of their friendliness . The trousseau tea is a modern adaptation , of the tea party . The young woman who is about to be married invites her friends to an informal tea at which she displays her trousseau and gifts ( see p. 279 ) . Tea , cinnamon toast , muffins , and fruit are usually served . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informal entertainment . The home is decorated with Japanese lanterns , rugs , incense burners , etc. , and the guests are required to wear Japanese kimonos . Real Japanese tea and rice cakes are served , with almonds and cookies in tiny lanterns to delight the guests . The latter , by the way , do not sit on chairs , but cross-legged on cushions in the approved Japanese fashion . At a recent Japanese tea the women guests were presented with miniature parasols as souvenirs . The high tea is a favourite form of tea entertainment when one wishes to invite eighteen or twenty friends without undertaking the trouble or expense of a dinner . Sunday // evening seems to be the popular time for the high tea . Small tables are used , four guests being placed to a table . These little tables are covered with tea cloths and decorated with a sprig of flowers in a coloured vase . At this type of tea one serves salads , sandwiches , cold cuts , tea or coffee , and cake . Coffee as a beverage was introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance in France in the same year . But long before the French and English had learned to know and love the rich aroma and pleasing flavour of coffee , the Persians and Arabians were using the beverage . The Arabian writers of very early times mention coffee as a drink . And the Persians are said to have drunk coffee as early as A.D. 875 ! The Turkish coffee party is a novel and interesting method of entertaining . The coffee is brewed at the table in a tall Turkish coffeepot and served in Turkish cups . The delectable Turkish paste candy and cookies are served with it . Among coffee lovers , the " afternoon coffee " has taken the place of the afternoon tea . In Germany " afternoon coffee " is indeed a social entertainment and is known as the kaffee klatsch . In the summertime , hostesses like to serve iced drinks to their guests . An iced-tea party would be good fun . The clever hostess would send out an unusual invitation ? something like the one that follows ? and make the party live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The tea , of course . There 's going to be plenty of it at Ridgefield Terrace on Monday afternoon . And some other cooling things to make you forget the weather . Shall I expect you at five ? I have a very special little surprise for you . The " other cooling things " can be chilled fruit , icecream , and peppermints . Or one might serve image ices and cookies . The " little surprise " might be a pretty fan or some similarly appropriate souvenir . With a little originality the clever hostess can make even // the simplest entertainment charming and delightful . There is absolutely no reason why the hostess with but a small home and limited equipment should feel that she is handicapped . She may not be able to give elaborate dinners or large formal teas , but she can certainly give jolly , informal teas and parties that her guests will enjoy . In the chapter on Holidays are various suggestions for entertaining on specific occasions . This chapter will prove helpful to the reader who is planning such entertainments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Games and the chapter on the Dance . The reader is urged above all things to remember that true hospitality is of the heart , rather than the purse . A cordial handclasp and a cup of tea can give more comfort and happiness than a stiffly formal and extravagant dinner party . CHAPTER XIII THE TALE OF TABLE MANNERS Ages before man felt the need of indigestion remedies , he ate his food solitary and furtive in some corner , hoping he would not be espied by any stronger and hungrier fellow . It was a long , long time before the habit of eating in common was acquired ; and it is obvious that the practise could not have been taken up with safety until the individuals of the race knew enough about one another and about the food resources to be sure that there was food su 1cient for all . When eating in common became the vogue , table manners made their appearance and they have been waging an uphill struggle ever since . ? RICIIARD DUFFY . FOOD AND CIVILIZATION M yAN was created hungry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason ; it is as natural an instinct as sleep . But to store up food for future use , to cultivate it , to cook it and make it palatable ? all this requires a degree of reasoning which came only after long ages of development . And to make of eating a ceremony , a social pleasure to be enjoyed with one 's fellows , requires a degree of cultural advancement which followed but slowly in the path of reason . Eating , then , knows no other origin than hunger and the natural instinct to satisfy that hunger . But eating habits , or manners , have been moulded by a million external influences through the ages of human existence . The development of eating habits has kept pace with man 's own development . Take any people in the world , study their eating habits from the earliest times to the present day , and you have a pretty fair picture of their social progress . The French and the English , who have reached what we consider a high degree of civilization in the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australians and the Africans , who are still groping at the bottom rung of civilization 's great ladder , eat with their hands or with crude implements . As surely as a compass points the direction a floundering ship must take , the eating habits of a people point to the direction those people have trod in the path of civilization . Luncheon with Primitive Man. ? Early man subsisted upon berries , roots , raw fruit , insects . He had meat when he could pick up a dead animal or kill one himself . We can see him prowling through primitive forests , this brute-man ancestor of ours , searching for something to satisfy the hunger that gnaws at his stomach like hundreds of insects trying to tear it apart . In the beginning , it did not matter so very much what he ate . And to the manner in which he ate , he gave not the slightest thought . Perhaps he finds a berry tree or some roots that are good . Perhaps he comes , suddenly , upon the remains of an animal upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is able to kill some small forest creature that crosses his path . Gazing quickly and furtively around , he sits down to his " luncheon . " We handle our food delicately . But early man 's instinct was to " wolf " his food ? eat it quickly and stealthily before some other hungrier fellow happened along . Therefore , if we are to be unseen guests at his luncheon , we must hide behind a primeval tree and be silent , lest we frighten him away . He has felled a bird with a stone . See how he tears at it savagely , just as a starving cat might tear at a sparrow . He crouches low under the berry tree and crunches the slender bones between his powerful teeth . A low growl escapes him as he hears a twig crack . We shrink back into the shadows . It would never do to let him see us . To protect his bit of food he would jump at us like a tiger . And who are we , of an artificial age , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // But we make up in reason what we lack in strength , so we wait until the fellow has gorged himself with bird and roots and berries , and we watch him while he sprawls out on the ground with a grunt of contentment and falls almost instantly into slumber . And we come a little closer to examine hirn . Here he lies , stuffed to exhaustion like any animal , the man upon whose shoulders all later civilization is built . See how clean he has picked the bones of his bird . Not a speck of flesh remains . His strong , sharp teeth have done a good job . No need for forks and knives here ! We take a bit of the bone for a souvenir and steal softly away , knowing the fellow will sleep until he is hungry again . And we walk on to meet the next stage of development . Man Begins to Eat Leisurely. ? We are going to dine with a group of cave people on the hill . These people live in a favourable climate , as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore the social instinct has made itself felt ; and as we climb the forbidding path to the cave home above , we see that there are half-a-dozen figures grouped about the fire . It would appear that a large beast of some kind has been killed . Taking our place silently at the head of the group , we watch the men around us for a cue as to how we shall eat . There are no eating implements . The men squat in a semi-circle around the fire . We see them tear huge pieces of flesh from the beast , devouring immense mouthfuls . Marrow bones they crack open and suck out the juices . They glance about them furtively , now and then , as though expecting to be attacked ; but they have none of the stealth and half-starved fear that we saw in the earlier man . The meal completed , the men sit out under the stars for a while , silent , or playful like well-fed animals , according to their nature . Then they enter the cave , rolling a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a few moments they are sleeping soundly . And we leave them sleeping so , knowing that they will // waken hungry again , go hunting , return with the kill , eat and sleep once more . From such rude beginning has grown our complex and highly polished routine of living . Not all peoples were quick to welcome company while they ate . The food resources of the locality in which a people found itself had very much to do with it . Where food was plentiful , men formed early the habit of eating together . But where food was scarce , men for a long time retained the habit of eating stealthily and in solitude . Just as the modern small boy eats his piece of cake or candy in some corner , hiding it selfishly from his playmates , primitive man ate alone because he was afraid of having someone steal his food from him . Habit , as we have seen in an earlier chapter , becomes custom . In later life we find it custom even for kings and priests to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Loango any person who sees the king eat is put to death . In Tonga everyone turns his back upon the king while he eats or drinks . The king of the Congo always eats and drinks in secret . It is said that the Emperor of Germany never ate in public but sat out every banquet before an empty plate . We venture that customs such as these , existing as they do in many places throughout the world , had their origin in man 's first fear of having his food stolen . But we find , as we turn a few pages in the book of life , that another element enters into this seemingly widespread preference for eating alone . This element , which characterized almost everything else which primitive man did , is fear . It appears to have been a common belief among savages , and still is to a great extent to-day , that evil could enter the body with food . Bad food or too much raw meat causing the tortures of indigestion would give rise to just such a belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his careless eating , primitive man would have blamed it on evil // spirits . And those evil spirits , according to his primitive reasoning , must have entered his body with the food . Thus great caution attended the eating and drinking of these early men . They avoided their fellows . They found their own food and ate it alone . The kings and chiefs particularly took great caution in eating , fearful of the enemies who envied them their power . Many authorities believe that it was this fear which led early rulers to eat in solitude rather than the fear of having their food stolen . To us it would seem that eating alone as a habit , handed down from very primitive times , came first ; and that in later primitive times the habit became custom , law , when man conceived the idea of evil entering the body with the food . For instance , it was at one time the habit of all the natives of Loango to eat alone . This was when food was scarce and fear of having the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plentiful the natives began to eat together , but it had become by that time the custom for the king to eat by himself . To-day it is a law that the king of Loango may not be seen eating or drinking under pain of death . Man did not begin to eat leisurely and in comfort until he came to realize that there was food enough for all . This realization , of course , did not come until comparatively late , and it came only to those who actually had an abundance of foodstuffs . To them it gave freedom from the fear of starvation , and they began to think of ways to improve the taste of their food , means of eating in greater comfort . Eating habits came into being , and they have been struggling step by step with civilization ever since . DEVELOPMENT OF THE CULINARY ART The first men did not cook or prepare their food , any more than an animal does to-day . They had hazelnuts // and beechnuts , wild cherries and gooseberries , crabapples , birds , eggs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Chinese ) , and small animals such as the rabbit , the hare , the rat . They ate to satisfy their hunger and with no sense of delicacy . We are told that they ate even the putrid , ill-smelling flesh of dead animals , developing a taste for it which has survived to the present day . The epicure will tell you that certain kinds of game and many kinds of cheese must be semi-putrid before they taste right ! For a long time there was no change in the eating habits of man . He was hungry and he ate whatever he could procure in whatever form it was procurable . Then came fire and its tremendous influence upon the daily life of man . He was able to cook his food and store it away for periods of famine . We see him , during this next great stage , at his " squatting place " as Wells calls it , around his fire , preparing the food before devouring it . He has stone implements . He roasts the ox and the bear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more leisurely than before ; and he has a knife made of flint to help him crack the bones and cut apart the beast . Mr. Wells says : The most probable way in which fires were started was by hacking a bit of iron pyrites with a flint amidst dry dead leaves ; concretions of iron pyrites and flints are found together in England where the gault and chalk approach each other . Sir John Lubbock and Ludwig Hopf advance the same theory . We have already seen how natural phenomena , such as a conflagration caused by lightning , or spontaneous combustion caused by fermenting vegetable materials , made known to man the power of fire ( see p. 14 ) . The use of fire for cooking food , first for purposes of preservation and later to improve the taste , seems to be of great antiquity . There are many curious traditions concerning the origin of fire . The Maoris tell this tale : The great Maui was given fire as a gift by his old blind grandmother , Mahuika , who drew it by magic from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger fire , so he pretended they had all gone out and prevailed upon his grandmother to draw him a new one from her great toe . It was a fierce fire she gave him , and everything melted before it . Even Maui began to burn , but a deluge was sent from heaven to save him ? and the world . ( A curious interpretation of the deluge myth . ) But Maui managed to preserve a few sparks of the fire , before it was all extinguished , and imprison them in some trees . From these trees , so the Maoris believe to-day , men draw their supply of fire . Finnish mythology tells us how " fire , the child of the sun , came down from heaven , where it was rocked in a tub of yellow copper , in a large pail of gold . " The legends of the North American Indians describe how the great buffalo , hurrying across the plains , made sparks fly into the night . These sparks set the prairie ablaze wherever the buffalo 's hoofs hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . The same idea prevails in Hindu mythology . The Dakotas claim that their ancestors obtained fire from the sparks which a friendly panther struck with its claws upon a stony hill . Origin and Development of Bread-Making. ? Strangely enough , bread , which is to-day a staple and practically universal item of diet , is one of the most ancient forms of food . The calcined remains of bread or cakes made from coarsely ground grain have been found in regions around the Swiss lake dwellings . Authorities estimate these cakes as dating back to the Stone Age . These cakes appear to have been made of a sort of bruised grain . Round-shaped stones have been found in the lake dwellings which were doubtless used for pounding or crushing the grain into a kind of coarse flour . It was probably the custom of the lake dwellers to place the dough on a flat or convex-shaped stone which was heated , covering the cake with hot ashes so that it would bake through . // Perhaps the earliest form of bread was prepared from acorns and beechnuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remnants of Indian tribes on the Pacific slopes who eat a sort of cake prepared from crushed acorns . Most of the Indians , however , used maize for their cakes . The early Egyptians used a charcoal fire to cook their meats . They made bread and caraway-seed cakes . Like the Israelites they were highly advanced in the art of preparing food , and they appear to have been among the first to know of meat-curing . Four thousand years ago the Egyptian noonday meal " usually consisted of a soup made of onions , garlic , and beef , although the flesh of the ibex or gazelle were used as favourite dishes . " The Israelites made bread , we know , for Abraham said to Sarah , " Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal , knead it , and make cakes . " ( Genesis , XVIII , 7 . ) With the cultivation of wheat , oats , and rye , and the use of yeast , bread-making became an art . The baker became a highly respected member of the community . Bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation food of mankind . One might say that civilization itself has been nourished and has grown big on bread . It is one of the oldest , most widely used and most nourishing foods of man . Concerning the Stove. ? The first stoves were simply hot stones . In using his flint knife , man evidently discovered that stone held heat , and soon we find him utilizing this discovery . Huge , round stones have been found which appear to have been used for purposes of cooking food . Some are flat , some concave . A large pot , of a later period , has been found containing several smooth round stones . It is believed that early man heated water by dropping hot stones into it . In early times , the fire was built in the centre of the cave ; and for a long time the cook fire occupied the centre of the home . But later the fire was moved to the side of the home , and in the 12th century chimneys to supply // draughts and to lead smoke and fumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick or porcelain tile have been in use in Holland , Russia , Germany , and other northern countries of Europe since the end of the Middle Ages . Prior to that period there was no way of leading the smoke out of the house , and the doors of cottages were made in two sections . The lower section was kept closed to prevent the chickens and pigs from entering ; the upper section was swung open to let the smoke escape . Cast-iron stoves were known in Alsace as early as 1490 , but they did not come into general use until considerably later . For many generations the brick and tile stoves were in use . The early colonists , we are told , did their cooking in open fireplaces . They had large swinging cranes on which to suspend their pots . For baking they used brick ovens . In 1744 Benjamin Franklin invented the portable fireplace of iron . To-day we have gas ranges , electric toasters , grills , a wide and astonishing array of highly perfected stoves . But when the palate tires of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wholesome tang of foods cooked plainly and simply in the primitive way ? over a roaring bonfire or buried in hot ashes . Campers will tell you they prefer such food to the highly seasoned and richly sauced foods of the modern table . Cooking as an Art. ? The ancients , though great eaters , had none of the subtle refinements of taste which we associate with food and with eating . They ate because they were hungry , and simple hunger does not produce the art of cookery . Food was not disguised to tempt the palate until man was sufficiently advanced to have acquired taste . As we study the development of the culinary art throughout the centuries , we can not fail to see how closely cookery is bound up with the physical possibilities of the various countries , and of course with its products . Where caterTHE // pillars were plentiful a taste was acquired for them . In China , for instance , even to-day dried caterpillars arc sold at the market and they are prepared for eating in various ways . The Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long buried that they are black , hard , and tasteless . We who find it difficult to understand such grotesque tastes as the Chinese have must remember that they have been accustomed to eat such food from the very earliest times , and they would consider our taste for rich pastries and creamy sauces quite as grotesque . In the United States , pig and chicken are eaten daily by great multitudes of people . But among the Samoans a pig or chicken is never killed unless there are important guests to be feasted . The difference is that in the United States pig and chicken are plentiful , while among the Samoans both are scarce . With increasing culture man developed a pampered ap-petite . By the time of the Greek and Roman civilizations , man was eating not only to satisfy his hunger but to please his palate . We know the sumptuous character of the Greek banquets . Athenaus took pains to get whatever information he could concerning the manner in which delicacies for the table were prepared by various peoples . There appear to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philogenes , Numenius , and in the third century before the Christian Era , the great Epicurus . The Romans borrowed from the Greeks their ideas of food and food preparation . We have already seen how the Romans sent messengers far and wide to secure for their feasts choice fruits and rare viands ( see p. 32S ) . They added a note of luxury and extravagance to the table ; but they did not add any notable subtleties to the art of cookery . They did , however , invent a baking pan with six spaces for baking batches of small cakes . It is interesting to note how old cheese is . The early Greeks appear to have been familiar with cheese as a // foodstuff long before they knew how to make butter . The Romans evidently copied from the Greeks the method of cheese-making , for they too are known to have had cheese in their dietary . It was known also to the early Egyptians and is mentioned in the Bible . The Beginning of Modern Cookery. ? Cookery , as we know it to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renaissance in Italy ; and Italy was indeed its birthplace . Possibly because of the traditions surrounding Rome , possibly because of the geographical location and the natural products , possibly because of a natural skill in cookery , the Italians became highly advanced in the art . It is apparently to the Italians that the development of cooking in Europe was due . According to Montaigne , Catherine de ' Medici brought Italian cooks to Paris and introduced there a new kind of cookery . Abraham Hayward , in his " Art of Dining , " tells us that the Italians were the first to introduce ices into France . As France was by this time the inspiration of social Europe it did not take long for Italian ideas to spread into foreign kitchens . According to the records that have come down to us , the Italians not only developed the art of cookery but the art of dining . They were among the first to use forks . Coryate , writing his " Crudities " in the time of James I , says that his friends mocked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Italian neatnesses called forks . " One of the greatest advances in cookery took place in France during the reign of Louis XIV . Bechamel was the king 's maitre d'hotel , and he is said to have created many new and tempting dishes . He is particularly famous for his sauce . Madame de Sevigne relates a rather pathetic tale of Vatel , one of the most famous chefs of this period . So conscientious was he in the preparation of foods that , when a fish that he ordered for part of a dinner he was arranging failed to come in time , he committed suicide . He welTHE // corned death rather than the disarrangement of his menu . Another great advance took place under Louis XV , who was a glutton if there ever was one . He ate for the sheer pleasure of eating rather than to satisfy any hunger . His reign saw many new developments . Mayonnaise , for instance , is credited to Richelieu . Originally it was known as mahonnaise . Various rich sauces of the time were named for la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name new dishes for celebrities of the day , and we meet with such names as " potage a la Conde , " " poulets a la Villeroi , " " chartreuses a la Mauconseil , " etc . So did French cookery develop , until the Revolution . From the beginning of the Revolution until the early 19th century the art suffered a decadence . But it was revived about 1825 by the celebrated Careme who has been at different times chef to Tsar Alexander I , George IV , and Baron Rothschild . Careme appears to have been an artist in dinner-giving . An account of one of his dinners can be found in Lady Morgan 's " France , " vol II , p. 414 . Careme was the author of the famous volume known as " Maitre d'hotel francais . " An important development of the Revolution was the appearance of many public restaurants in Paris . The first is said to have appeared in the rue des Poulies in 1770 under the name of " Champ d'oiseau . " Twenty years later , in 1790 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the Revolution was over and Bonaparte sat at the head of France , there were about six hundred . By 1815 the restaurants had attracted the best culinary artists of Paris . England appears to have had more authors of cookbooks than famous chefs . " The Accomplisht Cook , " by Robert May , appeared in 1665 . May was the son of a cook and is said to have studied abroad under his father . In the preface of his book he criticizes the elaborate dishes // of the French which , he indicates , were created as much to amuse and astonish as to satisfy the appetite . Dr. Pegge 's " Forme of Cury " ( 1780 ) is a rare and delightful old English work . It has between its covers many interesting reflections concerning the historical background of food and eating . He says , in one instance , We have some good families in England of the name Cook or Coke . Depend upon it , they all originally sprang from real professional cooks , and they need not be ashamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though the English became skilled in certain phases of cookery , they never quite equalled the French . We quote from the " Encyclopa ? dia Britannica " : At the present time , whatever the local varieties of cooking , and the difference of national custom , French cooking is admittedly the ideal of the culinary art , directly we leave the plain roast and boiled . And the spread of cosmopolitan hotels and restaurants over England , America and the European continent , has largely accustomed the whole civilized world to the Parisian type . The improvements in the appliances and the appurtenances of the kitchen have made the whole world kin in the arts of dining , but the French chef remains the typical master of his craft . Luncheon with primitive man ? and a noonday meal at a modern restaurant . What a tremendous cultural stretch separates the two ! WHEN MAN BEGAN TO DINE By no stretch of the imagination can we possibly call the eating of primitive man dining . True dining had its inception when man began to eat leisurely , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had table implements , no matter how crude . When he thought not only of what he ate , but of how he ate it , man commenced to dine in the finer sense of the word . Richard Duffy relates an interesting anecdote of the World War which we can not resist quoting here . He says ; // In the midst of the war , some French soldiers and some non-French of the Allied forces were receiving their rations in a village back of the lines . The non-French fighters belonged to an army that supplied rations plentifully . They grabbed their allotments and stood about while hastily eating , uninterrupted by conversation or other concern . The French soldiers took their very meagre por-tions of food , improvised a kind of table on the top of a flat rock , and having laid out the rations , including the small quantity of wine that formed part of the repast , sat down in comfort and began their meal amid a chatter of talk . One of the non-French soldiers , all of whom had finished their large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked sardonically : " Why do you fellows make such a lot of fuss over the little bit of grub they give you to eat ? " The Frenchman replied : " Well , we are making war for civilization , are we not ? Very well , we are . Therefore , we eat in a civilized way . " The " civilized way " seems to be on tables , out of dishes , and with knives and forks instead of fingers . Let us see how these appointments were given to civilization . Chairs and Tables. ? Who knows what comfort-loving savage first sat upon one stone and used another for a " table " ? The first chairs and tables will never be known . Primitive man , of course , had at first no furniture . The earth was his table , and the sky his ceiling . For eating im-plements he had his ten fingers and his great , strong teeth . But at about the time primitive man took to cave homes , the first crude forms of chairs and tables of which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge flat rock in the centre of the cave ; the chairs , smaller fragments of rock ( see p. 19 ) . Development of the chair and table , and of appoint-ments for the table , followed very naturally in the wake of culinary development . Where food was eaten raw , in solitude , and without preparation of any sort , the fingers remained the only implements and the earth remained the table . But where cookery lent itself to subtler develop-ment , becoming an art , dining too took on all the lights and shadows of advancing taste . For instance , in Rome , where every meal was a luxurious banquet for those who could afford it , we find rich and
