txt The Coast Guard blockading fleet faced it , s first big test last night when an all-day fog grew denser and the ships of Rum Row moved in , apparently ready for a rush of liquor to the shore . Eight rum vessels were sighted seven miles south of Sandy Hook by pilots who glimpsed them through a break in the gray curtain . The fog came up with the dawn . As it drifted down over the water , spreading out and gradually shutting off vision , it gave the bootleggers their firs ( chance for operations since last Tuesday when the Federal ships began to patrol fifty miles of line between the Row and shore . The weather , day and night since then , has favored prohibition . Rough seas by day which made it impossible for the speedy ' runner to stand alongside schooners or steamers and an ocean flooded by night with moonlight have helped make the blockade a success . But last night the sea was calm and the eyes of the patroling fleet were blinded by fog . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take all kinds of chances , " said Captain John I. Bryan , in charge of the Staten Island base of the blockaders . He said the precautions of the Federal ships had been increased and predicted that any smuggler trying to slip through the cordon of Government craft would find a patrol with guns ready for action athwart its path . The fog was reported heavier inshore than out near the row , which is about thirty miles off Ambrose Lightship . The mist was thickest off the lower bay and down to Barnegat on the'Jersey shore , that strip of coast long since estaylished as the rum runners ' favorite landing place . Arrivals at Sandy Book . ? The arrival of mother ships of the rum fleet was reported by Sandy Hook pilots who landed at Stapleton at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon . The pilots went out with ocean steamships forty-eight hours before , and as they went out no rum ships were sighted . Coming back , however , eight or ten vessels were observed hovering south of the Hook . The pilots made out three steamships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be two-masted schooners , heavily rigged , probably British . As quickly as officers at the Stapleton base heard of this concentration of rum craft , a wireless carried the news to the patrol boats at sea . Thep sped for the new flotilla , to intercept contact with shore . Coast Guard officers granted the skippers of the rum craft were usually skillful navigators and weather experts . The patrol was convinced the newcomers had foreseen the fog , and were closing in for illicit deliveries . The blockade is being systematized for a long campaign . it was reported yesterday . Hereafter the patrol boats  --  the smaller ones , at any rate  --  will bar the rum flow on a schedule . With thirtyeight boats maintaining the vigil at Rum Row yesterday and last night , seventeen were tied up at Piers 17 and 18 at Stapleton . In the future , under the schedule worked out , the patrols will remain at sea three days and then come in to give the crews a three-day rest .

The crews of these boats , which had sailed through or around the fringe of Rum Row . reported the liquor armada disintegrating . A desperate situation for the liquor ships was indicated by a statement made by one of the crew of the C. G. 205 , a seventy-five fool chaser . He said that Saturday when the patrol cut in close to one of the larger ; um vessels the master came to the rail with a megaphone . " Hey , you , " he shouted . " we need water . How about 100 cases of whisky for 100 gallons of water ? " The patrol boat refused to trade and veered off . The big rumtrader was still anchored in the Row when the chaser was relieved , the crew said . Men on duty at the Staten Island base gave the liquor ships until next Saturday to maintain the Row .

Coast Guard patrol crews assert that not a runner has been able to maintain contact with the fleet since the blockade went into effect . Captain IV . V. E. Jacobs , New York Divisional Commander of the Coast Guard , announced yesterday morning the receipt of a message in rode from the blockaders advising him the liquor ships were restless and sonic were heading southward . Deputy Chief Inspector Cornelius J. Cahalane reported that the Marine Division of the Police Department had ample evidence that the Coast Guard blockade Was a success . He said the police boats , led by the Gypsy , were scouring the bay in vain for the chugging of rumrunners ' engines these nights . Four picket boats and the C. G. 8 . Which was formerly the U. S.

The officers again denied reports that rum dealers were trying to terrorize enlisted men or their families . They scoffed at reports of threats , and said the damage to patrol boats had been done by hard wear . Blockade service is proving hard on both ships and men . he crews returning for rest periods sspend most of their time asleep , the officers say .
