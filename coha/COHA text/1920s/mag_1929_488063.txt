T HE SOVEREIGN STATE of North Carolina has by judicial process consigned seven men to prison for terms varying from five to twenty years for the murder of Police Chief Aderholt of Gastonia , but the doubt will persist that these men are guilty . The man who killed Aderholt was not identified , and not one of the Northern Communist organizers who received the heaviest sentences was shown to have fired a shot . Although the evidence against local Southern strikers was stronger than against the Northerners it was the Southerners who escaped with five- to fifteen-year sentences while Beal , Miller . , ; after , and Harrison were given seventeen to twenty ; - ea , s . The fate of the prisoners was sealed when Judge Barnhill admitted evidence to show that they held Communist and atheist beliefs . To a Southern fundamentalist farmer a Communist or an atheist is a criminal per se . That the jury convicted the prisoners for their beliefs as much as their crimes is indicated by the blanket verdict which found all the prisoners guilty of all the crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defendants on some of the charges was nil . Rolling on the floor , shouting , and kneeling in prayer Solicitor John G Carpenter in his summary before the jury denounced the defendants as " foreign Communists , " " fiends incarnate , " and " devils with hoofs and horns . " " Do you believe in the flag , do you believe in North Carolina ? " he screamed . The jury , saturated with nationalist superstitions and anti-labor prejudice , gave the only answer that could come from such a group . P RESIDENT HOOVER , meet Mr. Export Debenture ! Mr. Debenture , you will recall , is an old acquaintance who spent some time with us last spring and then went to the country for his health . Now he is back hale and hearty , and more popular than ever with his friends the Senators . You thought him an impractical fellow before , as we remember , on account of his economic views , and of course he came in bad company  --  just farmers ; but now that he is back along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rest , we ca n't help wondering if you wo n't at least have Mrs. Hoover invite him to tea . Of course , we do n't like his high prices even yet , but then we do n't like Mr. Aluminum Tariff and his high prices and all the rest of the Tariff boys with their high prices . You like them so well that we are sure you will be glad to see Mr. Debenture back walking arm in arm with them where he belongs . What ? You say you 'll veto Mr. Debenture ? Strange hospitality that , to anyone who promises to raise prices and make somebody rich . Goodby , 1VIr . Debenture ; call again . T HE " INTELLECTUAL ARROGANCE " which Senator Bingham always displays in the Senate was partially responsible , the press dispatches report , for the zest with which his fellow-Senators examined and scored the Senator from Connecticut who has now admitted that his hiring of a tariff lobbyist as his private secretary , to coach him as to what tariff favors Connecticut needed , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act merely emphasizes again Senator Bingham 's moral callousness and unfitness for the post he occupies . It is only a " mistake , " he thinks , to take an employee of the Connecticut Manufacturers ' Association , palm him off as his private secretary , put him on the government 's pay-roll , and let him into the secret hearings of the Senate 's subcommitee on finance with the result that 44 of the 52 industries of Connecticut received tariff favors aggregating $70,000,000 . Even the dyed-in-the-wool tariff men in Congress are appalled at this revelation of the way tariffs are made to suit the beneficiaries and are calling Bingham 's act not a " mistake " but a criminally stupid blunder . It is now up to the people of Connecticut to show how they feel . By his own statement the Senator conceived himself the representative not of all the people of Connecticut but only of the manufacturers and their employees . In that role he was willing to tax all the people of his State to enrich the manufacturers . Connecticut surely remembers that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was elected governor he would serve out his term . He was elected  --  and went to the Senate immediately Connecticut owes it to itself to call on the Senator to retire to private life .
