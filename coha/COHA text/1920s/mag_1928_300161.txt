Skeptics shrugged when Director E. S. Archibald of the Dominion Experimental Farm ebullated at Montreal : " I can say without any hesitation , that Canada is now the best country for farming in the world !

Farmer S. I. Harris , shrewd , bought a Milk River quarter section for $15 per acre , raised 10,000 bushels of wheat , and with the proceeds more than paid for his land . Farmers Loft &; Pederson slightly bettered even this phenomenal procedure , but other Milk Riverites were perceptibly less fortunate .
