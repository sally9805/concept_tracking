Fricka , wife of the King of the Gods , in the earthly simulacrum of a Polish soprano named Olzewska , stood in the Vienna Staatsoper , lifting a curve of song that flashed over the dark orchestration like a silver simitar . Another voice was also audible . Through the cadences of Wagner 's music , the brandished curve of Olzewska 's voice , it issued from the wings , rising and falling in charming periods , punctuated with little ripples of laughter , like : he voice of a woman telling a funny story . <P> The character of Fricka seemed to become momently less goddesslike . Strutting in a manner little indicated by her role , she approached the wings , hissed a plea for silence . The voice went on . Fricka then took from her bosom a word that Austria has defended with the lives of 10,000 duelists , hurled this after her plea . The voice went on . It was a moment for desperate shifts . Queen Fricka , somewhat forgetful of the proprieties , spat a jet of saliva which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled on the shoulder of a Valkyr . <P> " I am sorry , " said Mme. Olzewska , " I meant it for that farmyard animal . . . . " <P> " So ? " shrilled the charming voice , quite loud enough now to be recognized as that of Maria Jeritza , famed Baroness Von Popper ( TIME , Dec. 15 , Jan. 5 , Feb. 9 ) . " You shall hear of this ! " <P> That night the directors of the Vienna Opera sat in consultation . They knew that the temperament , the popularity of Mme. Jeritza , had long galled the other singers . Fricka 's spittle criticism was the outcome of a tiff that had been flaring ever since Mme. Jeritza , roseate from her U.S. triumphs , came to fill a spring engagement in her native metropolis . Who , the directors debated , was the mightiest : the wife of Wotan , or the wife of the Baron Von Popper ? <P> The latter , they decided . <P> Mme. Olzewska , forthwith ousted for " unseemly behavior , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her favor .
