Early one morning last week a fishing smack trailed by a rowboat - routine indications of a channel swimmer-appeared in St. Margaret 's Bay , England . As they crept toward shore a little Frenchman , perhaps the swimmer 's trainer , was seen gesticulating in the bow of the rowboat . He seemed afraid that his aspirant would fail in the last 200 yards and kept shouting , " Think of your mother . Think of your father . Think of your wife . " The man in the water , who was thinking of a double whisky , swam sturdily on . <P> Pale-skinned and obviously overweight , a huge mealy fellow whose labored breathing spoke of too many days spent at an indoor occupation and whose coated ribs hinted at a diet that contained too many starches , Georges Michel , Paris baker , staggered onto the beach having beaten the world 's record for channel swimming with a time of eleven hours five minutes . Stalking into a tiny bar in St. Margaret 's he had his double whisky and talked about the trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had felt a little seasick but that had passed . Then a cramp took hold of his belly but he rubbed it away . He ate some lumps of sugar dipped in brandy . Once a wave swept him off into the darkness ( he left Gris-Nez , France , at 8:27 P. M. ) and he did not sight the smack again for 15 minutes . As he reached shallow water ( at 7:30 ) two Frenchmen , capering with joy , rushed into the surf with all their clothes on . A woman thrust a white rose into his hand . He was going back , he said , to the bakery business .
