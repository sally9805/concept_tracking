The five men receiving the largest number of votes get the posts and when they take office within a week they name their choice for Mayor . Mr. Hague , who has served twelve years as chief executive of Jersey City , invariably is selected , even though he may get smaller votes than other successful candidates . On the regular Democratic ticket beside Mr. Hague the candidates were John Beggans , Director of Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Improvements ; Arthur Potterton , Director of Parks , and William B. Quinn , Director of Finance . The Fusion slate was headed by James F. Murray , a Democrat , who was looked upon as choice for Mayor with a victory . The other Fusion candidates were John V.

A big crowd gathered at City Hall with two brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal Square , where one woman fainted in the crush around Burkitt , the crowd assembled in front of the building of The Jersey Journal , an anti-Hague newspaper , and for a time became so menacing that a fire hose company was brought to the scene , ready for action if necessary . The hose was not put into play . Burkitt 's home at 76 Van Wagenen Avenue was guarded by two policemen after a window had been broken by a stone thrown from an automobile . Burkitt announced that he would go to the City Hall today to congratulate the Mayor and the other commissioners . He clearly showed that he was very dissappointed at the result . The Fusionists had counted on getting a big independent vote in the business and better residential wards on the " hill . " But even in these wards they failed to come up to expectations and Mayor Hague and his allies swept the lower wards with large majorities . In one district , the thirtieth of the eleventh ward , the Hague candidates received the first 100 votes counted while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote in the first 900 ballots counted was : Hague . 652 ; Potterton , 583 ; Quinn . 580 ; Begagns , 594 ; Fagan , 655 ; Meehan , 257 ; Morris , 240 ; Murray , 245 ; Ringle , 229 ; Hartung , 234 . Because of the bitterness of the campaign which preceded the balloting , a heavy police guard was established in the city to prevent any outbreaks , but last night Prosecutor John Drewen pronounced the election the quietest in years in Jersey City . There were numerous complaints and arguments at polling places , most of them of a petty nature , but only five arrests were made , two for illegal voting and three for causing a disturbance In a balloting booth . " There has been surprisingly little trouble , especially for an election so hotly contested , " said the prosecutor . " We looked for a great deal , but the election has been the quietest in a long while . There is no accounting for this unusual quiet . " County Superintendent of Elections John Ferguson , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places throughout the day , also commented on the absence of any serious disorder and said that it was remarkable in view of the heavy vote and threats of trouble . Rumors of Outbursts . But there was tension in the city throughout the day and many vague reports of impending outbursts of violence were current . An example of this attitude was presented in the afternoon when a riot call sounded at Police Headquarters . Inspector John Underwood and Captain Harry Walsh rushed over to Journal Square , the origin of the call , prepared for quick action . They found everything quiet and discovered that the riot call had been sounded accidentally by an employe of the Journal Square National Bank who had stepped on a burglar alarm . The disturbance which resulted in three of the arrests occurred at a polling places of the First District of the Eleventh Ward at 528 Newark Avenue and a real fracas seemed imminent until policemen got into action . William Padzuns of 3 Court House Place precipitated the trouble when he tried to vote and was challenged by Edward McCann and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapped him in the face . In a moment , the polling place was in turmoil with fists flying and cries filling the building . A crowd gathered but the police scattered it and took all three men into custody charged with assault and battery . They were released in $500 bail each . Late in the afternoon Thomas Gillen , whose address was the subject of dispute , was arrested at the First Ward polling place on the complaint of Harry Spiwak , a Ferguson deputy , and charged with illegal voting . He was released on his own recognizance by Judge Leo Sullivan . John F. Kennedy of 45 Montgomery Street was arrested on a similar charge later at 74 York Street and was also paroled . Mr. Meehan , one of the Anti-Hague candidates , figured in a row over alleged irregularities in several polling places , where it was charged that Hague election officers were tearing ballots . In a First Ward polling place he became engaged in an argument with James , a Hague watcher , who was checking names in ' a notebook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two hours while the charges were being threshed out . No arrests were made but the Hague headquarters issued a statement asserting that Meehan was disorderly . Mr. Meehan became angered and demanded withdrawal of the statement , charging slander . The statement was repudiated later by Hague headquarters . " Jeff " Burkitt voted at Public School 23 in the Tenth Ward and he voiced his confidence in a victory , rain or no rain . As the reports of the large early vote reached the headquarters of both Hague and fusion tickets , spokesmen were ready to claim advantage for their factluns . At 2 P. M. 55,000 persons had ballotted , far ahead of the total for four years ago and even ahead of the total in the presidential election last year . Hague managers claimed the increase as theirs while the Fusion spokesmen said that every vote above that of the last municipal election was a clear indication that the populace was aroused and intended to end the Hague rule .                @ @ @ @ @
