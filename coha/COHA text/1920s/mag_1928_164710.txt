Kodakman George Eastman had some guests-Thomas Alva Edison , Henry Fairfield Osborn , Michael I. Pupin , General John J. Pershing , Owen D. Young and many another bigwig-at his home in Rochester , N. Y. , last week . He showed them some motion pictures in color . He told them how simple the process was . Years of complicated experiments have gone into developing the Kodacolor film , minutes of mechanical adjustment are enough to operate it . Color photography is still imperfect ; not all the primary colors can be made to go into the eye of a camera and come out lifelike but such as it is , it now comes within the scope of all who have the price of a Cin Kodak and a roll of Kodacolor . In the hand Kodacolor looks like any other film ; under the microscope it looks like corduroy ribbon . The tiny corrugations are microscopic lenses , made of the film substance , running the length of the film , 559 to the inch . Different from the lens of eye glass or microscope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the sunlight after a storm , making a rainbow . Once the process is perfected , they are simple , economical to make . The camera is fitted with a three-color filter : red , green , blue ; the red , green , blue rays coming from the subject march each through its own section , pass through the main camera lens ; fall upon the tiny film lenses . These act as policemen , guiding each light ray to its own place on the sensitive emulsion ; making that place more or less transparent according to the light rays that come in . There is no color in the finished film . It is a pattern of various degrees of transparency and opaqueness . If run off in an ordinary projector , it would throw the ordinary black and white picture on the screen . But if the color filter is inserted , each minute transparent or opaque space on the film will be directed by the microscopic lenses through its own section of the color filter ; falling upon the screen in its original color ; producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lauded Kodakman Eastman .
