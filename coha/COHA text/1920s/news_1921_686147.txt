txt Following its flat 15% cut in salaries for office workers and other salaried employes receiving less than $5,000 a year . American Smelting &; Refining Co .. has announced wage cuts to the day 's pay men at its various smelters and refineries that also average about 15% . The cut in wages varies somewhat at different properties , having been adjusted in a general way to correspond with living costs at the individual plants , but folloTs in a general way recent reductions in wages at mines and smelters in the West . The salary reduction is to take off fiat increases in wages and bonuses given to meet the increased cost of living . As no officials getting $5,000 or more a year received a war raise , no reduction in such salaries has been made .

The company is in a position to hold this metal and it expects to get prices considerably above present quintdons , but whether it can break even on these copper transactions only the future trend of copper will tell . Probably . though , a-considerable loss will eventually result ' as during most of 1920 price of copper was above 18 cents a pound .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
