A group of earnest business men met last week in an upholstered committee room in the Woolworth Building . They were members of the Manhattan Merchants ' Association-a Special Committee on the Simplification of the Calendar . They discussed the various inconveniences which the world has been compelled to put up with since the days of Julius Caesar because of the clumsy time-divisions with which that dictator encumbered civilization . <P> Clement M. Biddle , President of the Biddle Purchasing Co. , said that 137 plans for changing the calendar had been submitted to him , of which he had read 30 . The plans were , in general , of two kinds-those that divided the year into four equal quarters , and those that gave it 13 months . <P> One gentleman proposed to make 1927 the beginning of a new world , the first year of time , 1 G.C. The initials , he explained , stood for " Globe Calendar , " of which he was the deviser . <P> One Dr. Theodore de Daragic declared that each year should be divided into ten months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six days . This would account for 360 days . " The remaining 5 , " said Dr. de Daragic , " could be added to the year as a series of holidays , each feast to be named after a great man-the first after Jesus Christ , the second after Columbus , the third after George Stephenson ( part inventor of the locomotive ) , the fourth after Robert Fulton ( perfecter of a paddle-wheel steamboat ) , the fifth after Henry Ford . " <P> One Louis Rapaport , representing the National United Women 's Wear Association , said that the needle trades want a stable calendar .
