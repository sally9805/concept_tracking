The Secretary of Agriculture must deal with crop-years-from sowing-time to harvest-time-rather than with fiscal* years , which , in the U.S. , begin and end in the middle of calendar years . Secretary Jardine , reporting on the crop-year 1927-28 and anticipating 1928-29 , announced : <P> That the U.S. farmer 's gross income increased somewhat in the past year : <P> 1926-27 income $12,127,000,000 <P> 1927-28 income $12,253,000,000 <P> The 1928-29 income should be still larger . Specially well off are dairymen , beefmen , poultrymen , hogmen . Not so well off are grainmen , haymen , tobacco-men , potatomen . <P> Despite bad weather , yield-per-acre was 3% above average this year , although some 10,000,000 acres of winter wheat were frost-killed and a cold , wet June hampered reseeding . <P> Acreage of crops harvested was record-breaking . The year 's increase exceeded any year since 1918 , when farmers planted for war . The Mississippi flood of 1927 caused this sharp difference . The report remarked : " Expansion of acreage is not always desirable , and the expansion this year in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acreage , however , is at least a mark of confidence in the future of agriculture . The increase was pretty well distributed throughout the country and was divided among cotton , spring wheat , potatoes , and other leading crops . A decline representing a shift to more intensive crops took place in the acreage previously devoted to hay . " <P> The unusually large cotton acreage suffered unusually from boll weevil . <P> The wheat crop exceeded 900 million bushels for the first time since 1919 . <P> Event-of-the-year was the success of the livestock industry . Cattle prices reached a peak record-breaking for peacetime . <P> <P> * In Latin , fiscus-money basket .
