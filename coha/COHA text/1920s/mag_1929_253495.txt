With Herbert Hoover already in Washington , the Coolidge era seemed to hurry to its close . <P> Who but the historian recalls an August night among the Vermont hills less than six years ago-reporters in automobiles rushing over country roads ; a knock on the door of a white farmhouse in the hamlet of Plymouth ; oil lamps lit dispelling the darkness ; telegrams read by their glow ; a brief statement of mourning ; an oath of office administered at 2:30 a. m. by a country notary public to his son , the thirtieth President of the U. S. <P> The new President 's first worry was railroad accommodations ; he wired ahead for three parlor car seats and was amazed to find a special train awaiting him . With him and his wife on that strained journey to the capital rode the Boston businessman named Stearns whose ancient dream of a Northampton mayor in the White House was coming true . <P> There followed a few days in the Vice-Presidential suite at the New Willard Hotel and the wholesale resignation of the Cabinet - Hughes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Work , Weeks , Daugherty and Denby - and every resignation rejected as it came . There followed the entrance into the White House with eight trunks , and the appearance of astute C. Bascom Slemp , Virginia politician-Secretary , at the Presidential elbow . Came William Morgan Butler , manufacturer and campaign manager , not yet dreaming of the Senate . <P> Followed threats of a great hard-coal strike , and Gifford Pinchot , Governor of Pennsylvania , rushed to the breach . <P> Followed Secretary Mellon 's proposal of a second great post-War reduction , which sent the country ringing with applause . <P> Came the first Congress under the new President - that Congress which first brought the Scandinavian glassblower and dirt farmer , Magnus Johnson , to Washington . Then , Mr. Coolidge 's first message to the Congress , the message which dealt with everything in a few blunt monosyllables and proved that he was " safe . " <P> Can that 68th Congress have been forgotten ? It fought three mighty fights . It passed a soldier bonus bill over Mr. Coolidge 's veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Democratic figure . It stirred up the greatest hornet nest of a political generation , the Harding scandals - Oil , Veterans ' Bureau , Department of Justice , Prohibition Enforcement-which , inch by inch , forced Denby , then Daugherty out of the Coolidge Cabinet . <P> Can citizens have forgotten the great three-cornered battle front of 1924 , the Cleveland convention where the old guard in revolt named Frank O. Lowden for Vice-President and , when he proudly turned them down , revolted again and named Charles Gates Dawes , with whom afterwards they quarreled ? Or that eleven-day wonder , the convention in the old Madison Square Garden where McAdoo fought Smith , and Smith fought McAdoo and Alabama 103 times cast 24 votes for Oscar W. Underwood , till John William Davis and Bryan the Lesser were boosted to the limelight ? Or that second convention in Cleveland to which the Senator from Wisconsin , who in Jo Davidson 's mass marble will soon adorn the Capitol 's hall of fame , sent his ready-made platform and took Burton K. Wheeler for his running mate ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried the day , " Keep cool with Coolidge. "
