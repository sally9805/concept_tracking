Just as the German airship Graf Zeppelin hovered over her home port Friedrichshafen last week , the German Lloyd seaship Columbus moored fast to her Manhattan dock . Aboard her was James Leslie Kincaid , retired brigadier-general of the New York National Guard . And while German crowds howled their hochs at the Graf Zeppelin 's safe , record-breaking return , General Kincaid growled his grouch at U. S. aviation . <P> He had attended the recent International Aero Exhibition at Berlin . No U. S. aircraft were there , only two Whirlwind motors hidden in foreign planes and a picture book of other U. S. motors and machines . General Kincaid was ashamed . " I felt , " said he last week , " like turning up my coat collar and slinking away . " He noted too that " Germany has 60 cities linked by air transport now . Over this network is maintained a constant fast transport of mail , passengers and freight . No other country in the world has anything to compare with it . " <P> But General Kincaid , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston and New York , New York and Montreal , and Albany and Cleveland , * knew well that he was grumbling rhetorically . <P> Last year U. S. commercial planes flew close to 6,000,000 miles , German planes about 5,750,000 . This year U. S. planes will have flown nearly 12,000,000 miles . Because the area is 20 times as large as Germany 's , there is vaster opportunity for the expansion of the U. S. industry . <P> The Graf Zeppelin , now Germany 's most famed airship , on her return flight from the U. S. to Germany , covered the 4,500 miles in 71 hr. , 12 min . That was 10 hours faster than any of the four other trans-Atlantic airship trips . The record : <P> Hrs . Mins . <P> Graf Zeppelin ( eastward ) . 71 12 <P> Graf Zeppelin ( westward ) . 111 30 <P> R34 ( eastward , 1919 ) ... 108 12 <P> Los Angeles ( westward ) .. 81 17 <P> The British R-34 's fast flight was from New York to England , and over a windblown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip. + <P> That return journey last week was terrific for the airship 's crew . East of Newfoundland they headed into a gale . It threatened to crack up the boat . Dr. Hugo Eckener headed into the wind and slowed his motors . The wind blew him backwards at the rate of 32 ft. a second . <P> Eventually he gained headway towards the Bay of Biscay . There again a storm bumped him . But he shouldered through it , over-fog-clouded Nantes , over hazy Tours , over Lake Constance . The Hallowe'en moon watched him . And as the sun rose for All Saints ' Day he dipped his Graf Zeppelin 's nose down towards the howling German crowds and his hangars at Friedrichshafen . <P> *Colonial Air Transport , Western Airways , Canadian-Colonial Western Airways . Also , he is president of the American Hotels Corp . <P> +The Cunarder Mauretania , fastest ship , has crossed the Atlantic in 122 hours .
