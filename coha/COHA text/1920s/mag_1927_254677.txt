Soon people in Washington began to stir-in the temporary White House , President and Mrs. Coolidge , and Mrs. Evangeline Lodge Lindbergh were arising . As the sun grew brighter and hotter , the tempo of the capital approached allegro . One hundred Army and Navy airplanes darted above and below and around the dirigible Los Angeles , like sharks baiting a whale . The guns of the presidential yacht Mayflower boomed a salute . Factory whistles shrieked . Nautical tunes bounded over the waters of the Potomac . The Memphis docked at the Navy Yard . Mrs. Lindbergh went aboard to embrace the son who had quickened the tempo of the world 's chronicle since she last saw him . <P> Then mother and son were driven up Pennsylvania Ave. , as 150,000 people became hoarse . President Coolidge and another 150,000 were waiting in the vicinity of the Washington Monument .

Twelve thousand police carried no clubs ; but linked arms , used hands , charged on horseback to keep the crowds from absorbing the parade on narrow Broadway . At the City Hall , Mayor James J. Walker presented Colonel Lindbergh with the city Medal of Valor , said to him : " We are familiar with the editorial ' we , ' but not until your arrival in Paris did we learn of the aeronautical ' we ' . " At Central Park the struggling grasses were browbeaten while 250,000 humans watched Governor Alfred Emanuel Smith pin upon Colonel Lindbergh the state Medal of Honor . <P> Such were the outstanding spectacles last week in the welcome of Colonel Lindbergh .
