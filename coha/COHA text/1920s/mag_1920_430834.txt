 | NOBODY likes to wash dishes , and yet three times a day in every home somebody 's time and energy must be expended at that most unpleasing task . GOOD HOUSEKEEPING INSTITUTE has no cure-all for this dishwashing evil , but certainly there are ways to make dishwashing a lighter and a more agreeable task than it is in many homes . I know , because I have washed dishes where it is much less tiresome than in other places . I can almost see you smile when I make the first stipulation that the sink shall have two drain boards . Without the two drain boards it is not possible to wash dishes with a tranquil mind , because there is not the orderly progression in washing that is possible with two drain boards . Think for a moment ? the soiled dishes are stacked in neat piles upon one drain board , washed in the sink directly or in a dish tub in the sink , and then drained upon the second drain board , which should mark a step toward the storing place or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is an urge to stack the soiled dishes in the sink around the dishpan ? even , in ignorant hands , to fill the dishpan too full because the one drain board must be kept free for the clean dishes . And here you have breakage on the one hand and a disorderly , fretful mental condition on the other . GOOD HOUSEKEEPING INSTITUTE stresses mental efficiency in housekeeping far more than actual hand efficiency , because housekeeping if anything , is one hundred percent mental , and that housekeeper who accomplishes her work in a state of reasonable moderation is the one whose house is made a home because she can make its inmates comfortable . The next stipulation for hand dishwashing ' is a fiber rather than a metal tub for washing dishes , because it lessens noise and possibly breakage . Another essential is a dishwashing brush or mop , because there is no reason in modern dishwashing for keeping the hands ha water with a dishcloth , to become parboiled and unpleasant in feeling and appearance . Perhaps the most important thing of all is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an excess of alkali is considered good enough for kitchen use . It is not . Economize , if you will , on the bathroom supply of toilet soap , but see that there is an ample supply of neutral white soap in the kitchen , and you will have fewer complaints that dishwashing destroys the ap- pearance and whiteness of the hands . Finally , when you are through washing dishes , wash your hands with the white soap , using plenty of lather , and instead of rinsing this lather off , pat it into the hands with the towel . It is surprising how soft will be the texture imparted to the skin by this treatment . The actual procedure in hand dishwahing involves first the scraping and stacking in piles . The old rule of washing silver and glassware , then china , still holds good Where only a small number of dishes , say for three or four people , are to be washed it is possible to do it with a constant stream from the hot water faucet and without a dishpan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hot water and that there is a bowl of rich suds in the sink that you may use for the stubborn grease spot . When dishes for a larger number are to be washed , the old dishpan method is quicker . But wash in plenty of clean , sudsy water , hot as the brush , not the hand , can endure , and do n't rinse . This may seem like heresy , but dishes drained from suds have a greater sheen than if they are rinsed . They must be drained from clean suds . This is a further argument for i  | using a soap that is neutral . Glassware and china that are rinsed from suds can be wiped to produce a glittering sheen , while when rinsed from clear water . it is difficult to keep them unstreaked . Moreover , the towels keep comparatively fresh and dry . Another method obviates any wiping . Scald the dishes , place in a suitable rack , and leave to dry . Washing dishes by these methods possibly takes no less time than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time more agreeably spent . Mere are other aids to dishwashing that are especially good for the young housekeeper who is willing to take time to change her mental attitude toward dishwashing . I refer to the fountain type of dishwashing device , in which there is a constant flow of water and suds through a brush , in which case no dishpan is used . The stacking must be accomplished just as for hand washing , but each dish is washed in its own clean stream of water . In using any ; of these devices there is a tendency to send a greater flow of water through the brush than is needed . The faucet should be turned until there is only a mere trickle . Then there can be no complaint of excessive water waste , nor is there the disagreeable splash that occurs when too much water is sent through the brush with force . A dishwashing machine operated by electricity is an excellent thing in every household , no matter what the size . from the standpoint of sanitation of washing dishes and from the standpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when the household is under four in number . It is not a good investment under any circumstances unless it can be piped to a discharge . When a machine is not piped to a discharge , the task of transporting water , wiping up the floor , etc. , consumes the time saved in actually washing dishes . Moreover , there are some " wrinkles " in using the machine that will affect the results you obtain from it . Nor do we advise the use of hand machines , although it is possible to obtain very good work from them . The trouble with the latter is that a woman 's stroke is very seldom a matter of precision , and unless that stroke is even in its power , she is apt not to obtain the cleaning results that the precisely driven motor machine would give her . Like all hand apparatus it is only as strong as the right arm that uses it . Just as in hand dishwashing , the dishes must first be scraped of all excess food material before they are placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed immediately in the machine . The illustrations on this page will help to show you how the dishes are stacked . Two styles of machines are shown . In the upper left-hand corner the illustration shows a machine cylindrical in shape stacked ready for operation with both racks in place . In the upper right-hand corner a machine oblong in shape is shown similarly packed . Down the center of the page are four illustrations showing the detail of dish stacking on both racks of both styles of machine . The stacking is very quickly accomplished and takes the place of piling in the hand dishwashing process . When the machine is stacked , put into it hot water up to the water line . Either machine requires only seven or eight quarts of hot water ? not an excessive supply . The water used need not be boiling hot , in fact , @#  | water which is only as hot as the hands can bear is better for machine dishwashing . This obviates any " cooking on " of albuminous or starchy materials . Place in the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eightounce bar of neutral soap in two ' quarts of water and then allowing it to cool . Close the cover and turn on the switch . Operate for from two to five minutes , or even longer , depending on the condition of the dishes . Drain off the water and pour in clean hot water , the hotter the better . Operate the machine for one minute . Then drain off the water , lift the cover , and polish the glasses and silver with a clean towel , but leave the rest of the dishes in the racks to drain . If the water has been very hot , the drying will be almost immediate . The machine may be operated for a minute or two after the rinse water has been drained off . The circulation of air thus created facilitates drying . Just a word as to the kind of dishes to which a dishwasher is adapted . A dishwashing machine is intended essentially for the washing of serving dishes only . Cooking dishes , for the most part , we must continue to do by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a machine dishes which have been used for baking , like casserole and custard dishes and saucepans in which starchy puddings , etc. , have been boiled . The hand washing of such utensils is facilitated by the use of a mop , the head of which is wound with spun copper . This proves most efficient and spares the hands considerably . Mixing dishes ? bowls in which eggs have been beaten , bowls in which batters have been mixed , if they have been immediately rinsed out in cold water , and similar dishes ? can easily be cared for by the machine . We have found that even a greasy plank can be more thoroughly and more easily cleansed using the dishwashing machine than in any other way .
