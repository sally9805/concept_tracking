The trolley car , or-as their operators prefer to call it-the " electric railway industry , " is only 36 years old . Not until May 4 , 1888 , did the first commercially successful overhead trolley car appear in this country and spell the extinction of the older , slower and smaller ' horse car ' systems . To Richmond , Virginia , belongs the honor of witnessing on that date the beginning of the electrically-operated street railways . From that experimental beginning , the industry grew until at present it represents about $6,000,000,000 of invested capital , an annual income of about $1,000,000,000 and a record of carrying some 16,000,000,000 persons in 1923 . At first the new " electric railways " often proved very profitable and several of America 's large private fortunes resulted from them . During the War and until very recently , however , the industry fell upon evil days . Operating costs were doubled or tripled , fares advanced little or not at all , competition with jitneys arose , and about a sixth of the industry went into the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junk . <P> Now , according to the American Electric Railway Association , the industry is coming back . Cooperation between trolleys and buses is being effected , living fares are paid , and the public is taking a more sympathetic interest in its local trolley lines . In 1923 the industry spent over $2,000,000 in advertising and intends to increase its appropriations for this purpose during the present year .
