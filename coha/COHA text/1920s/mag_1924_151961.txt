Those who know would hardly say that Alfonso XIII , King of Spain , was in any way a ruler endowed with remarkable gifts of kingship . Yet it remains an incontrovertible fact that he is a most amiable person and a sportsman of sterling qualities . As sovereign of Spain , he is undoubtedly in a most difficult position . His democratic leanings are well enough known . In principle , he agrees with the British conception of monarchy ; but , unfortunately , Director Primo Rivera and his satellites are masters of the situation and , willy-nilly , the King must bow to the inevitable and accept for the time being a military dictatorship for his country which has for its avowed purpose the purging of a corrupt political system . <P> Whatever the King 's personal character may be , he is at least entitled by the rules of the game to fair play . Under him , Spain may weather the anxieties of the moment and emerge triumphant , bearing the banner of democracy on high . His downfall , while it would relieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of political anarchy for Spain , in which the force of corruption would be let loose . He is the figurehead through which progress can be made ; without him Spain must go the way of the Spanish republics , the way of end less revolutions . <P> Thus when Vicente Blasco Ibanez , a writer of ability , but of little depth , attacks the King of Spain , his plot is doubtless fodder for the cinema kings . Beyond that it need not be taken seriously . The attack was delivered and much was made of it in the daily press . Said Blasco : <P> " Never has history shown a mon arch more deceitful and less powerful than the cruel and faithless puppet of the Spanish throne . Men are judged by their company . Alfonso 's greatest friend is the only man who surpasses him in ignominy , if not in stupidity - Primo Rivera . He is a companion in the King 's debauch and has dirtied the uniform in every kind of adventure and every haunt of vice . <P> " The time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the inquisition ; and for that accomplishment Alfonso must go . I will know no rest until the country is free . I know the dangers I run . My family will be persecuted and my property seized , but I shall not falter . Whatever reputation I have acquired in literature and all my strength are at the service and for the deliverance of Spain . " <P> The New York World , champion of Liberalism , apparently could not see the woods for the trees . It declared that " Don Blasco is too intelligent not to be a republican . The King business has been a bad business for Spain . " The " King business " is a favorite expression of The World . Because the Prince of Wales is " entirely composed of prestige " -a statement far from the truth-the " King business " ought to be wound up . Because Ibanez is seen as " the greatest of all Spaniards " - an absurd contention-the " King business " in Spain ought to be wound up . A critic said : " Such childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new countries ; but , for those with hundreds of years of tradition behind them , it is utter folly . Compare Germany , Austria , Russia , Hungary . Think of the suffering France has gone through to achieve republicanism. "
