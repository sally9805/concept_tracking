txt The usual fall conditions are apparently at hand in the gasoline market , with Atlantic Refining reducing one cent a gallon in its Pennsylvania-Delaware market and Standard Oil of Kentucky making a similar reduction in the five southern states in which it markets . Such changes at this time are not remarkable and more are likely to follow , for this is the season what . demand slackens somewhat and is accompanied by price reductions . October should prove a month when supply and demand will be about in balance or a slight withdrawal made on storage , and then will follow the customary winter storing . The remarkable thing about the gasoline market has been the unusual uniformity of price with which it has been characterized during the big spring-summer c-msmiling season . With a record production far below 11 unprecedented demand , gasoline prices remained at high levels all through the year to date . This is an exceptional condition , for in the firs ? five months of this year there were price advances aggregn-mg about four cents a gallon in the territory east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prices rem.lited unchanged in this big territory and no territorial price reductions occurred until those just announced by Atlantic Refining and Standard of Kentucky . The result has been that the big marketing and ' refining companies have enjoyed not onl record bum- esz but one winch was accompanied by profitable price levels land caused the largest draught on stored gasoline ever known during these good prices . Effect of the Atlantic Refining Co. ' s cut of one cent may be a similar reduction in adjacent territories of Standard Oil of New Jersey and Standard Oil of New York . However , it may be pointed out that the Atlantic 's level was one cent a gallon higher than the others and is now on even balance with them . This may meal , . the other to. ? may not reduce immediately unless they want to continue the one cent differential . Reduction of price by Standard of Kentucky may be expected to affect the adjacent market of Standard Oil of Louisiana . California has been the only place where the " price war " elements really got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the last few weeks . ReducLions there have totaled four cents a gallon , all in a week 's time . However . informed oil men figure the drastic reauction in the Pacific Coast market results in the oil companies selling the public the same gasoline at the rate of $40,000,000 a year less than prior to price cuts . Under such conditions . sanity is anticipated and it is regarded more than likely that the California gasoline price war will soon be composed with restoration of the greater part of the price cut . With California *rude prices unchanged , the four-cent a gallon cut has wiped out the margin of profit for most marketers . Going back over the figures for the first eight /ninths of this year and contrasting them with last year , the gasoline demand has far exceeded anticipations . Refir era pushed plants to a point where it became a question , in many instances , whether to crack the oil further for gasoline would mean an insufficient kerosene supply . By the end of March gasoline in storage got to a top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stacks in 1925 . By the end of August , stocks had been reduced 11.552,000 barrels , a little more than 33 1-3% ; in contrast , gasoline storage was reduced but 5,276,000 barrels to the end of August , 1923 , a reduction of about 14% from that year 's peak . The end of August this year found stocks below those of August , 1925 , and the lowest since the end of 1924 . With gasoline demand growing with leaps and bounds and consumption in a winter month like January get:ng to a level where it exceeded the peak summer month of 1923 , refiners should continue large runs of crude thr. , ugh the winter to build up sufficient storage for demand : watt year . Oil trade circles expect some upward adjustment of gasoline prices in the Pacific Coast marketing district to develop in the near future . The price " war " in that territory has been under : say for about three weeks and the general cut of four cents a gallon by leading marketers in the seven states comprising the territory has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price reduction undoubtedly has bean found too drastic , particularly as there was no real conanion of oversupply of gasoline in the district . Affecting such a wide territory , the result has been a sub=antial cat in profits . Based on the volume of business handle , : in the seven states , reliable estimates are made that a ' : Pacific Coast marketing companies have been suffering a combined loss in income at the rate of 540,000.000 a year on the lower gasoline prices . Realization of this situation is expected to bring about the price adjustment , the expectation being that the pica will be raised two or three cents a gallon . Another factor which would influence a price adjustment is the fact that there has been no reduction ' n the price of California crude oils to compensate for the lower gasoline price levels . This has meant that marketers who have had to purchase part or all of thee : crude have had to pay the same price for their raw material as they did when gasoline was selling four cen : - a gallon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
