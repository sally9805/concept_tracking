Several suburban affairs of the heart <P> The Stories . The scene was the Woman 's Saturday Club . Mrs. Cromwell had just read an essay : Women as Revealed in Some Phases of Modern Literature . Mrs. Cromwell 's good friend , Mrs. Dodge , rose in criticism not of Mrs. Cromwell but of literature : " Mrs. Cromwell 's paper has pointed out to us that in a novel a study of women must have a central theme . . . . Now , so far as I can see my own life has no such centralizations . . . . Our lives seem to be made up of apparently haphazard episodes . . . . So I say . . . why should such a book about women be centralized and bound down to a single theme , a single conflict , a single heroine ? " This is Mr. Tarkington 's apology in his preamble . He then plunges into a book of 31 chapters , which is really a collection of nine rather disconnected episodes taking place in a certain circle of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and Mrs. Dodge 's great concern for a neighbor , Mrs. Battle , whose husband is running after another woman . Mrs. Battle worships her husband with apparent ecstasy-takes his name as an authority 100 times a day-and yet it turns out that she is better able to look out for her interests than either of the other two ladies expects . <P> Of Mrs. Cromwell 's second daughter , Anne , whose popularity a more successful rival attacks only to lead to Anne 's getting the pick of husbands . <P> Of Mrs. Dodge 's only daughter , Lily , whose affections are according to her own estimate the tenderest , and according to " her parents ' estimate the most wayward . She adores a perfect good-for-nothing . Twice she has tried to elope with him . Her parents can not undo the match but she , defeating them , defeated her passion . <P> Of Mrs. Cromwell 's youngest daughter Cornelia 's puppy love and its tragedy . <P> Of Mrs. Dodge 's neighbor , the saintly Mrs. Braithwaite , and the breath-taking secret that Mrs. Dodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of Lily Dodge 's second erratic love affair , and of her dear friend Ada , who is quite a model daughter . The terrible consternation of Mr. and Mrs. Dodge is revived but changes to thanksgiving . <P> Of Mrs. Cromwell 's niece Elsie , ugly duckling , who discovers she is a cygnet . <P> Of Lily Dodge 's accidental conquest of an heir to millions . <P> Of how Anne Cromwell ( now married ) comes to the aid of her older sister , whose husband is being taken by another woman , and how Anne 's own married life is temporarily upset in the rescue of her sister from peril . <P> The Significance . All of Mr. Tarkington 's little episodes are light , cleverly told-prose de societe . The effect of each is heightened by a surprise ending , a clever twist at the denouement . But Mr. Tarkington does not live up to his preamble . The book is not a novel in effect but a collection of short stories casually linked .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
