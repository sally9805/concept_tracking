Boris cast an anxious eye out of the S Street window . It looked like rain . Boris is a Serbian who lost his last name in the war . He works as valet for a big , thickset , friendly-faced engineer whose friends and helpers all call him The Chief . <P> Today was to be The Chief 's big day . As Boris helped The Chief into a pair of grey pin-striped trousers and a formal morning coat , he felt like giving little adjusting pats on the broad shoulders . <P> The Chief went downstairs to breakfast alone . The rest of the family was late . Afterwards Mr. Justice Stone dropped in for a chat . A truck came up with two sacks of mail-presents for The Chief , which were not opened . <P> After giving The Chief 's silk hat ( which The Chief detests ) a final swirl , Boris , with others , got into an automobile and was driven off through crowded streets to the Capitol : a monstrous building with a domed centre , . the like of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind blew up from the Potomac . The clouds were growing thicker . Boris was distressed . <P> Boris did n't see the arrival of two top-hatted gentlemen with whom The Chief and his wife motored two miles to the White House , where Calvin Coolidge stood in the Blue Room to greet them . Outside , two dozen motor cars were in line . Mr. Coolidge and The Chief went out and got into the first car , their ladies following in the next one . The chauffeur of the No. 1 car stepped on the self-starter . Wheels within groaned loudly but the motor would not start . The chauffeur gasped at himself and the motor . The Chief looked worried . Cameramen pressed in closer . Finally the engine spat , caught , hummed properly and the open car rolled down the gravel drive and out upon Pennsylvania Avenue . Calvin Coolidge did not look back at the White House . Mrs. Coolidge paused to say goodbye to policeman at the gate . <P> Rolling around the Treasury behind an escort of cavalry , Mr. Coolidge and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the route to the Capitol . The Coolidge silk hat moved up and down in frequent response to this acclamation . The Chief 's headpiece moved less frequently . One irreverent youth screamed " Oh you Herbie ! " from the sidewalk . <P> Boris , already at the Capitol , knew when The Chief arrived by the yell that arose from the plaza . Mr. Coolidge went up the broad steps of the Senate wing at a quick , almost jaunty , pace . The Chief was slower , measured his stride more carefully . Once inside Mr. Coolidge walked around to the President 's room , just off the Senate lobby , put his silk hat down on the green felt table top , sat down in an arm chair , signed many bills . His Cabinet stood about him , eager to be of last-minute assistance . When he had finished he motioned shut the ponderous doors and lighted a cigar . <P> The Chief , head lowered , was taken to the Military Affairs Committee Room where he stood first on one foot , then on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know told him how happy they were on his Big Day .
