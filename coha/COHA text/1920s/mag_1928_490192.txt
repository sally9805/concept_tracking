NO one 's eye is keener to detect " trends " than is ours . We can sometimes discover as many as three trends while walking between Thirty-fourth Street and Fifty-seventh Street . Our latest discovery is that a large proportion of the parties given for charity this season have taken place aboard ships in the harbor . We were not long agog about this . Getting down to causes we found the reason simple : the party is a good vehicle with which to introduce a new steamship to the right kind of people and hence easy picking for the charitable organization . It also provides glamor for the guests , ships being glamorous even when prosaically tied alongside . We have attended several of these waterfront affairs and our impulse has always been to stay aboard for the sailing and send a radio saying we did n't know the party was over until too late . OUR seat was perilously close to the speaker 's table a week or so ago when Lindbergh received twenty-five thousand dollars and a plaque from the Wilson Fund and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What we noticed particularly was that when the chairman produced the medal , which was about the size of a dinner plate , Lindbergh never really took it in his hands at all . The speaker held it up where all could see it and then laid it on the table . In all the rotogravure sections which have since pictured the event , however , we saw Lindbergh with the plaque actually in his hands . That is because ( as this wise old head has long known ) the ceremony had been run through for the benefit of the press and the movies prior to the actual banquet , in order to get the messy journalists out of the way before the food came on . So insistent and bulky is the machinery of publicity , this pre-staging is the custom now at public affairs . The public  --  reading its morning paper , viewing its newsreel  --  rarely sees the actual event , but sees instead the romanticized and studied version . Our hope for the future is that , with a little perseverance on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves can be dispensed with , so that , after the press has been satisfied , everybody can go home , thus saving a good deal of time , bother , and filet mignon . WHEN the news got round last fall that Mr. Kahn had given of his substance to remodel a house in Greenwich Village to provide better living conditions for artistic persons , it was not quite clear to us what constituted an artistic person . The gleam of art sometimes lies in the eyes of white wings and cab drivers . Nor did we feel sure what would happen when persons of a distinctly creative turn of mind were huddled together under one roof , the strain being terrific . A friend who gets down below Fourteenth Street now brings us news that throws light on these matters . He reports that the house filled quickly with artists and writers last October , but that several of the tenants have since slithered away to California , to the Orient , and other places that artists go . " What about the lease ? " has always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creative genius had n't understood the sanctity of legal contracts . Thus the perplexing and seemingly insoluble situation is this : a person who understands anything so prosy as a lease is per se inartistic . It looks like a stalemate . THERE is a fear which hangs over suburbs like a mist . Sometimes it is a spectral shape , pointing a finger . It is the fear in the hearts of young wives and young husbands that they are becoming Babbitts . They have read about such ignominy . Not long ago , a young lady whose husband commutes from Hartsdale was at a party in town ; was , in fact , busy telling us many things about her life . " Bert and I do n't play bridge , " she said , earnestly , as though she were staking out a claim in our field of vision , " because we both know how easy it is to get in a rut . " She paused to see how this news got over . " And , " she added , as though on second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . " A System WHEN we received a letter the other day beginning " How many dinners , theatres , business opportunities have you missed because your telephone  --  at the crucial moment  --  said ' Do n't Answer ' ? " we thought hopefully that the telephone company had finally conquered wrong numbers and busy buzzes and such . Although it proved to be no such millennial pronouncement as that , it was , nevertheless , interesting . It was the prospectus of a new enterprise , the Telephone Message Bureau , behind which is an important though a simple idea . It is merely this : that for a fee , the bureau , which has an agreement with the phone company , will list your name in the phone book like this : Finney Sterling r E 76 . . . sQuare 0000 If no answer call Ancdef 0000 If someone calls you and gets no answer he calls the bureau number and later  --  say between acts  --  you can call the bureau number and find that Uncle Ned and Aunt Edith have arrived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and you can call it any time . If you do n't phone for a message before midnight it is mailed to you . Numerous reasons are listed , or hinted at , as to why one should subscribe to this service . Reason C says that it is fine for all those in offices or factories where " personal calls " are discouraged . Reason D is coy . It points out the advantages to " those who for any reason would prefer not to receive certain calls over their home telephones or would appreciate the opportunity thus afforded to select the calls they wish to respond to and avoid others . " There is an annual five-dollar charge for listing by the bureau , a five-cent fee for each call and a monthly assessment for the special notation in the phone book . They do n't require that you be listed though . If you so desire you may keep it secret and merely let out the secret of the bureau number only to such persons as you want to . There is , in fact , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets his own private code number and he must repeat it before they will give him his messages . If at any time he suspects that his watchword is known ( say to the Germans ) he can have it changed . " Every day , " the announcement declares , " thousands of New Yorkers miss pleasures , business success , even romance itself , because their telephone does n't answer . " Do n't we all know that ! It need not happen again , however , we are promised . Way of a Man ACROWDED subway train , southbound , rounded into a sta tion and halted with a jolt . A young man , who had been lost in the pages of the Evening World , looked up quickly . He beheld a young lady swaying from a strap in front of him . Her eyes took on a light of hope as he half arose . Then ? " Where are we ? " he asked her . " Wall Street , " she said , in a sweet , tired voice . The man looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and resumed his seat . Lights RISING on either side of the Greenwich Village stoop of His Honor , James J. Walker , at 6 St. Luke 's Place , are two iron lamp posts on top of which are electric beacons that burn far into the night . They have all the appearance of a latter-day elegance , but , as a matter of traceable historical fact , they represent the most ancient , perhaps , of all our municipal traditions . They have been burning , figuratively , for no less than two hundred and fifty years . It all began when New York was as Dutch as wooden shoes . In those days there were no gay white ways and when the sun went down the good burghers were dependent on the moon and their lanterns . No man went abroad in the dark without carrying his own lighting system with him . The burgomaster himself , when he cleared his desk for the day , lighted his candle and made his way home by its light . When he reached his own doorstep he hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . The purpose of all this was service . It was the burgomaster 's duty to settle all the problems of his subjects . When a husband returned home late and found himself entangled inextricably in argument with his wife both made their way to the burgomaster 's lantern , got him out of bed and let him settle things . Often he was as busy during the night as during the day . Oil lights came , then gas , then electricity , but the custom of always marking the mayor 's domicile with lamps persisted . It still does , and , since the lamps are attached to the buildings , they become the property of the owner and usually are allowed to remain indefinitely . Now the city is dotted with beacons which mark the residences of various municipal executives . The lights remain on the house that John F. Hylan occupied when mayor . On West 121st Street the home of Mayor Thomas F. Gilroy ( 1893-94 ) is similarly marked . At the corner of Twenty-second Street and Lexington Avenue the Abram S. Hewitt home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city in 1887-88 . Up Lexington at Thirty-ninth there are beacons in front of the William H. Wickham home ( Mayor 1875-76 ) . The William R. Grace mansion in East Seventy-ninth Street has been thus lighted since 1881 . The lamps which graced the home of Cornelius Steenwyck , who was mayor as long ago as 1668 , are undoubtedly still in existence although we have never been able to learn their whereabouts . The Steenwyck home was in Maiden Lane . When that narrow thoroughfare gave way to business the lights were removed by the family and preserved . In 1868 they were put up at auction by heirs and sold to a secret bidder for an excellent price . Japanese Courtesy WHILE visiting in Tokio last winter a traveller from this city dropped in one afternoon at what he took to be a tea house . He gradual- ly became aware that he had made a mistake and the nature of it was revealed to him when he was approached by an attendant who spoke some English . It seems he had invaded an exclusive club for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There the Oriental thought a moment , obviously groping for something courteous to say . He scowled and then smiled and said : " Come again  --  very soon . " The Town Clocks WE joined a group looking into the sky at Forty-third Street and Broadway a short time ago and watched a tiny mite sticking to one hand of the Paramount clock . This was a man and he was engaged in removing the hands . Becoming interested in the troubles that must beset eternity ticking away that high in the air we investigated promptly and thoroughly . It turns out that the clock was heckled by high winds which sometimes blew the tips of the hands through a quivering arc of thirty degrees . On some days this caused a loss of as much as ten minutes every hour . Ice also slowed things up . Moreover the device for lighting the hands failed . Finally a day of worse winds than usual put the giant all out of kelter . Obviously nature 's twitting of man 's ponderous achievements could not go on in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about solving it and finally decided to install a series of clutches which ( we do not pretend to know quite how ) would meet the wind resistance . To do this the hands had to he taken down . It was only after considerable difficulty that a few structural steel workers were hired for the task , a perilous one in the spring winds . They were paid from twenty-five to thirty dollars a day . After three weeks ' work two of the dials have now been fitted with the new contrivance . Mr. Lansing Powers of the Seth Thomas Company , which put in the clock , supervised the work . They say he is the foremost of authorities on tower clocks and their maladies . The dials of the Paramount clock are twenty-five feet across . It is the second largest on the island . The biggest is the Metropolitan Tower clock , which is twenty-six feet in diameter . After the Paramount clock comes the one on the Carl Fischer building in Cooper Square . When it is installed , the one on the Consolidated Gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereabouts , in fact the largest in the world , is the Colgate timepiece which tells the hour in a big way on the Jersey waterfront . The dial measures fifty feet . The minute hand weighs twenty-two hundred pounds , is a little longer than twenty-seven feet and travels one hundred and fifty-seven feet each hour . Originally it was brought from the factory on a flat car . The only other clock in the world approaching this one in size , except for its predecessor which was thirty-eight feet wide and told time there for sixteen years , was , we are told , built by the monks in the Middle Ages for the town of Mechlin , Belgium . It was partly destrayed by the Germans and no longer runs . The very nicest statistic on the Colgate clock which we heard is that the weight of the hands and movemerit is equal to that of sixty-four thousand ladies ' wrist watches . Enforcement AN official of the telegraph company told us the other day that his company has received calls from two speakeasies asking that their news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on whose heat the establishments are located had solemnly decided that the stock quotations and racing results which come in on the tape were conducive to gambling and therefore had best be suppressed . Flower Man NE of the people we saw at the ON Flower Show ( and did n't have space to tell about last week ) was Mr. Max Schling , the florist , whom we have long regarded as an interesting man . When he was only fifteen he designed , by imperial order , the bridal bouquet for the Grand Duchess Valeria , daughter of Emperor Francis Joseph . He had intended to study art but his eyes failed . The doctors prescribed outdoor work and thus he became employed in the botanical gardens of an eminent floriculturist in Vienna , his birthplace . At fourteen he was win ning prizes with his floral designing and smart bouquets and it was through this that he came to the attention of the royal family . He had then , and still has , an ability to look at a lady and prescribe the precise arrangement of corsage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen dollars a month at his first job in America , but after two years saved enough to rent a stall in a public market at Fifty-sixth Street and Sixth Avenue . He sold only five dollars worth of flowers in two days and this seemed pretty slow . To stimulate business he used an advertising trick of his own invention . He would send a box of flowers to a pretentious address and later telephone apologetically that there had been a mistake and a boy would call to retrieve the bouquet . Usually the recipient asked to retain the flowers . Moreover many such householders became customers . Thus stimulated , his volume of business in the first year totalled ten thousand dollars . Today the amount is around half a million . Mr. Schling had a hand in perfecting the Flower Telegraph Delivery  --  long-distance sending of bouquets  --  and he put the system to a magnificent test last summer when the Rotarians sailed for Europe . One of his trucks carrying flowers for many of them broke down on Tenth Avenue and missed the boat . Mr. Schling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to London by a faster boat , and cabled detailed orders abroad duplicating each of the bouquets ordered here . A tug met the ship in the harbor when it arrived and delivered the flowers ordered , the original greeting card attached . He now gives courses which are attended by florists from all over the country and he has endowed horticultural scholarships in Cornell and other universities . He is proud of his production , after eighteen years ' work , of a four-leaf clover plant . It took that long to perfect one that would not revert to the three-leaf type . The florist does n't like noise and has a trick of dropping a book as a signal to his employees if they grow too talkative . When he goes to the opera or a concert he always reads a book throughout the performance to avoid becoming conscious of the audience . He prefers books on ancient and medieval history and adventure stories , and he subscribes to and reads The American Boy . Life and the Theatre THE office boy who dusts our desk has scornfully pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , one which , we have concluded , should be made note of here . It comes in the third-act climax of one of the mystery plays , " The Trial of Mary Dugan . " A left-handed murderer is sought , it having been established that the dead man of the piece was slain by a left-handed person . The culprit is finally detected when he catches a knife casually tossed at him , in his left hand . This convinces the court , the District Attorney , the police and , so far as we know , all audiences to date  --  everya matter of fact , our young instructor adds , almost everyone is ambidextrous in catching , using whichever hand is the approaching object . He says that at the great climax of this play he therefore reached for his hat and went home . Old Familiar Face HARVAHARVARD men RD who visit a new restaurant in Fiftyseventh Street called the Granada Grill are falling on the neck , quite literally , of the rotund black doorman resplendent in new maroon uniform and gold-toothed smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terry of beloved memory , for nineteen years clerk and general factotum of the Dean 's office in Cambridge and famous for his memory of students ' names and faces . We went to the Grill this week with a Harvard 1911 man whom Terry greeted , " Why hello , Ernie , what are you doing here ? You belong in Cleveland " ? which was a fact . Later we drew Terry aside and asked him what mark " Ernie " had drawn in English 45 . " A T ' , " said Terry at once , " and Phi Beta Kappa key in his Junior year  --  a good boy that . " Another Harvard patron of the restaurant , Mr. Howard J. Sachs , was startled to have Terry call him by name and say : " Let me see  --  Sachs , Howard J. ? middle name Joseph . There were four Sachs , Paul 1900 , Arthur 1901 , Walter 1904 , and Howard J. , 1911 ? Right ? " While at Cambridge , Terry 's chief extra-curriculum activity was on be-half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big games several hundred grads would turn up at the Athletic Association 's office ask-ing for duplicates for the tickets they had lost en route . It was always a difficult mat-ter to sift out the legitimate ticket-holders from the im-posters who took advan-tage of the situation , and the crowning achieve-ment of Terry 's mem-ory was in 1915 when out of five hundred and three applicants he identified five hundred , and caught , red-handed , three imposters . The story is that Terry no longer holds his university post because of his soft-heartedness . In 1919 it was discovered that he was not only disclosing to nervous undergraduates the results of examinations before the sacred date for the publication of marks , but also , on occasion , raising the marks from failure to passing . One Harvard man assures us that Terry saved more students from flunking out than any professor or tutor in the university .
