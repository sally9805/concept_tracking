For the last ten years there has never been a year when Ralph Greenleaf was not , for a while anyway , the world 's pocket billiard champion . Last week , under various shaded pyramids of white light in Detroit , he tried to get his title back . Frank Taberski , defending champion , was below form , and it was Erwin Rudolph who played Greenleaf in the finals . <P> The crowds at billiard tournaments are never very big , but Rudolph and Greenleaf had another audience which followed their contest in newspapers and discussed it in doorways-the enormous and tremendously expert audience of U. S. pool players . Pocket billiards is another name for continuous pool . You play it on a sixpocket table with 15 numbered balls and a cue ball . You must name the ball you want to pocket and the pocket you are shooting for . If you make your shot and knock in some extra balls you may count them too . All other pool games-cowboy , rotation , kelly-are variations of this Green game , but experts shun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his dead-white face immobile as plaster in the strong light , his oiled hair shining like paint , Ralph Greenleaf made run after run . Once he annoyed Rudolph who , having just missed his 24th shot , complained that Greenleaf had disturbed him by walking around . The referee said he had not noticed it . Greenleaf ran 41 in the first half of the 11th inning , Rudolph ran seven and missed . At the end of the match Greenleaf had his 125 points and the championship to Rudolph 's 69 . <P> Rudolph had consolation in the fact that earlier in the tournament , in a match with Spencer Livsey , he had dropped in balls in succession , had beaten his opponent in four innings , thereby establishing two world 's records in one game .
