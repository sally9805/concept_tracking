Air travel drew a step closer to rail travel when Mr. &; Mrs. D. J. Sullivan in St. Paul , Minn. , bought a ticket for Rochester , Minn. , climbed into a plane , enjoyed the scenery for an hour , inquired about landing time . " Rochester ! " exclaimed the one addressed . " Why you 're on the plane for Chicago . " <P> The ship-to-shore mail plane catapulted from the liner lie de France , flown by Naval Lieut . Louis Demougeot , forced down at sea , was rescued by the British trawler Children 's Friend . Temporarily the ship-shore service has been discontinued . <P> A marine pilot , Capt . Howard , flying over Nicaragua involuntarily came to earth near La Luz mine on the east coast . His pontoon dug into the earth , ploughed a furrow . Corporal George Cole left to guard the plane , whiled away the time by panning out $100 worth of gold from a vein thus exposed .                @ @ @ @ @
