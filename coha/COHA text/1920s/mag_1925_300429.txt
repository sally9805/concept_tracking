" Since 1694 written records have been preserved of her spinsterhood . Now at last an old servant , one W. Marston Acres , long in her employ , is to write her biography .

A comnittee of the Federation of British Industries is urging that a 20% increase in value be added to the penny . There would then be 10 pennies to the shilling and 200 to the pound ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " crowns , " " farthings , " and other odd lot coins .
