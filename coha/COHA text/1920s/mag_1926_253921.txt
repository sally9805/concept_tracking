She , tender , susceptible , had yielded to the suit of Count Alexander Skrzynski ( 6 ft. 3 in. ) , onetime Premier of Poland ( TIME , May 3 ) who visited here last year ( TIME , July 27 ) . Miss Ford would bring to Poland enough gold to send the zloty zooming up to par . . . . <P> For a day all Warsaw basked in the roseate dreams beloved of Poles . Then the U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter . . . . <P> Warsaw editors , resourceful , instantly covered their booming blunder . It was marry Count Skrzynski .
