HE rides a white horse , Mary Madonna , Dappled as clouds are dappled , 0 Mary , Mary , And the leather of his harness is the color of the sky . On his head is a casque with an azure plume Which none may observe with unswerving eyes . A proud gentleman , Mary Madonna . A knight to fill the forest , riding it crosswise , O Mary , Mary . His hoofprints dint the beech-mast , His plume brushes the golden leaves . No flute man this , to sigh at lady 's elbow . This is a trumpet fellow , proper for jousting or ba Mary Madonna , To hack an enemy to pieces , and scale his castle wall . 0 Mary , Mary , A point for piercing , an edge for shearing , a weight for pounding , a voice for thun-dering , And a fan-gleam light to shine down little alleys Where twisted houses make a jest of day . There are dead men in his hand , Mary Madonna , And sighing women out beyond his thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anywhere . He will go about his business with an ineradicable complaisance , Leaving his dead to rot , his women to weep and regret , his sons to wax into his likeness , Never dreaming that the absurd lie he believes in Is a gesture of Fate forcing him to the assumption of a vast importance Quite other than the blazoning of ceremonial banners to wave above a tomb . II Hot with oranges and purples , In a flowing robe of marigold color , He sweeps over September spaces . Scherezade , do you hear him , And the clang of his scimitar knocking on the gates ? The tawny glitter of his turban , Is it not dazzling With the saffron jewel set like a sunflower in the midst ? The brown of his face ! Aye , the brown like the heart of a sunflower . Who are you to aspire beyond the petals , To touch the golden burning beneath the marigold robe ? His sash is magnificence clasped by an emerald ; His scimitar is the young moon hanging before a sunset ; His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dahlias ; His fingers , the flight of autumn wasps through a honey-colored afternoon . So , Scherezade , he has passed the dragon fountains And is walking up the marble stairway , stopping to caress the peacocks . He will lean above you , Scherezade , like September above an orchard of apples . He will fill you with the sweetness of spice-fed flames . Will you burn , Scherezade , as flowers burn in September sunlight ? Hush , then , for flame is silence , And silent is the penetrating of the sun . The dragon fountains splash in the courtyards , And the peacocks spread their tails . There are eyes in the tails of the peacocks , But the palace windows are shuttered and barred . III Pipkins , pans , and pannikins , China teapots , tin and pewter , Baskets woven of green rushes . Maudlin , Jennifer , and Prue , What is lacking in your kitchens ? Are you needing skewers or thimbles , Spools of cotton , knots of ribbon , Or a picture for your pantry , Or a rag-rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusty Lanes between the hawthorn hedges , My green wheels all white and dusty , I as dusty as a miller , White as any clown among them Dancing on the London stages . Here I have Grimaldi 's latest , Songs and ballads , sheets of posies For your feet to ring-a-rosy . Songs to make you sigh and shudder , Songs to win you bright eye-glances , Choruses , and glees , and catches . Do your cupboards need refilling ? Take a peep into these hampers . I have goods to loose your purse-strings : Smocks , and shifts , and fine-clocked stockings , Aprons of a dozen sizes , Muslin dresses sprigged and patterned . Can you look and not be buying ? Maudlin , Jennifer , and Prue , Here arc dainties for sweetheartings , Tinsel crackers plumped with mottoes , Twisted barley sticks and peardrops . Here are earrings , chains , and broaches , Choose what gift you 'll have him give you . If the sweetheart days are over , I have silver forks and bodkins , Leather breeches , flannel bed-gowns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and candles To light up the page of evenings . Toys , too , to delight the children , Rocking-horses , tops , and marbles , Dolls with jointed arms , and flying Kites , and hoops , and even the Royal Game of Goose the world is playing . When I camp out on a common , Underneath an oak or linden , And my horse crops at his supper , Finding it along the hedgerows , Then I play at Goose , with one hand Taking sides against the other . First my right hand holds the dice-cup , Then my left , each has its counter . ' Tits a pastime never tires . Coppers , coppers , for the pedlar . Maudlin , Jennifer , and Prue , Fare you well , I must be jogging . Horse-bells tinkle at the lane-sides , Green wheels growing whiter , whiter , Lurching van of whims and whimsies Vanishing into the distance . IV Who would read on a ladder ? But who can read without a ladder ? Cheerful paradox to be resolved never . Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four quarters Of all the possible distances . Minerva have a care of him , For surely he has none for himself . His eyes are din with the plague of print , But lie believes them eagle-seeing . His spectacles have grown to his nose , But he is unaware of the fact since he never takes them off , A little black cap on his head ; A rusty dressing-gown , with the quilts run together , To keep out the cold ; A window out of which he never looks ; A chair from which he never rises . But do you not know a wharfside when you see it , And are you not moved at watching the putting off of the caravels of dream ? Food gets into his mouth by accident As though fish swam the seas to come there , And cattle crowded the thoroughfares to reach his lips . If there are intermediaries , he is unconscious of them , As he is of everything but his cat , Who shares his vigils And has discovered the art of projecting herself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foregathers with a thousand caravans . To-day is as remote as yesterday , ? And he is avid of either with the intensity of a partaker of each ; He could hobnob as blithely with Julius Caesar as with King George or Samuel Gompers , And his opinions on affairs of the moment are those of an eyewitness Although he never sets foot out of doors . Indeed , Minerva , you should watch the step of this gentleman , For be runs so swiftly past events and monuments it seems incredible he should not trip . The walls of forbidden cities fall before him ; He has but to tap a sheepskin to experience kingdoms , And circumstance drips from his fingers like dust . An habituated eye sees much through a pin-prick , And are not his observations folio wide ? He eats the centuries And lives a new life every twenty-four hours , So lengthening his own to an incalculable figure . If you think you see only an old man moldering between four walls , You are greatly mistaken . Minerva over the door could tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and he will not hear you ; Write a book and he knows you better than you know yourself . Draw the curtains , then , and bring in tea , with plenty of buttered scones . Since neither the old gentleman nor Minerva will speak to us , I think we had best ignore them and go on as we are .
