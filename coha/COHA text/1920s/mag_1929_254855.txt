Natural Art and Fine Art met , last week , in sunny congress on a California hilltop at the western terminus of the Lincoln Highway , overlooking the burnished haze of San Francisco . There stands California 's memorial to her War dead , the Palace of the Legion of Honor , an edifice filled with many treasures , including the life of Joan of Arc in Gobelin tapestries , gift of France . <P> Within the palace and in the surrounding gardens were placed , last week , some 1,200 images carved by 300 sculptors . Largest show of its kind in U. S. history , it was called the Exhibition of Contemporary American Sculpture . Held under the auspices of the National Sculpture Society , it will remain on view through September . <P> The value of the exhibition is not so much that of a spectacle as it is of a visual encyclopedia , wherein the seeker may find any trend or individual expression in modern U. S. sculpture . There is , inevitably , much routine work-conventionally graceful garden groups , conventionally austere memorials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Alexander Archipenko , possessor of an arresting linear imagination ; there are Allan Clark 's glamorous oriental shapes ; Harriet Whitney Frishmuth 's tender and charming studies of adolescence ; Jacob Epstein 's mottled , vigorous countenances ; Paul Manship 's images of swift , hound-escorted Diana and Actacon . Many are the stimuli for the senses , but nowhere is the mind so provoked and fascinated as before the portrait sculpture of Jo Davidson . Master of men and millions , the face of John Davison Rockefeller is anxious , unbelievably seamed above his sparse and fragile body . Mistress of precious intellection and writer of what seems gibberish to most readers , Gertrude Stein is shown with a face rugged , calm , confident above a stolid mass which scarcely defines itself as a body . There are many other works by individual chisellers , Hunt Diederich , Daniel Chester French , the late Emil Fuchs , John Gregory , Malvina Hoffman , Leo Lentelli , Henry Augustus Lukeman , Edward McCartan , Eli Nadelman , the Piccirilli brothers , Lorado Taft , William Zorach . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sculptural tradition as deeply embedded and fertile as the Classic or Gothic , it does have a number of sincere experimentalists who keep the art from stagnation , who seek the expression of modern contour and character .
