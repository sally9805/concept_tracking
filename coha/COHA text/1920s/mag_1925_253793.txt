When , in 1806 , the Holy Roman Empire , after more than 800 reeling years , was jostled into its last bloody gutter by a Corsican elbow , when Virtue raged unchecked in England and that shrewd but disappointed politician , George III , was declared hopelessly insane , certain print shops in London began to sell miniature theatres . With them they sold engraved cards of scenes and characters ; the price-a penny plain and tuppence colored . The game of playing with these toys became a fad more prevalent even than Virtue , and as fevered as the undone George . Recently , in the bookshop of S. Nott , in Manhattan , some of these tiny theatres appeared in an exhibition . <P> " A pair of boots for Jack Sheppard , " " A sword for the Red Knight , " " A suit of armor for Sir Florian . " Thus spoke honest burghers in London printshops on Saturday nights . They laid down their pennies , took home boots , sword , armor , cut them from their cards , pasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains . Often the scenes constructed in the three-sided rooms of the toy theatres were works of subtle art . Artists afterwards famed sometimes got bread by engraving the penny cards , the tuppeny cards-Blake , Flaxman , Cruikshank . Thousands worked at the making of the theatres ; now only one man is left who gets his living so-one B. Pollock of London ; he is the last . Yet there still remain here and there a few people who cherish the toys . Ellen Terry , actress , possesses a little theatre and a collection of the plays from which its scenes derive ; Charles Spencer Chaplin , cinema comedian , lightens with one his melancholy hours ; G. K. Chesterton , paradoxhund , is said to play with one while thinking out his articles . Many are preserved in Jacobean farmhouses , in Tudor mansions , in dour Scotch castles , in London palaces .
