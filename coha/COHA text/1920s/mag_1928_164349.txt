The President of Mexico took a pen into his heavy fist and signed , " P. Elias Calles . " <P> The document before him comprised new regulations altering the effect of those Mexican oil laws which the U. S. has branded as " retroactive and confiscatory " ( TIME , Feb. 22 , 1926 ) . <P> President Calles , it is safe to say , would not have signed the new regulations , last week , except for the fact that the U. S. now has in Mexico City a new and abler-than-usual Ambassador , Dwight Whitney Morrow , onetime Morgan partner . By large business methods and with a Morgan-sized grasp of essentials , Mr. Morrow has , in four months , cut the oil snarl which has embittered the U. S. and Mexico for a full decade . <P> One year ago the U. S. State Department thought and stated that a " Bolshevist Hegemony " existed in Mexico . Last week the Department issued an official communiqu , in part as follows : <P> " The petroleum regulations just promulgated by President Calles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion the discussions which began ten years ago with reference to the effect of the Mexican Constitution and laws upon foreign oil companies . The Department feels , as does Ambassador Morrow , that such questions , if any , as may hereafter arise can be settled through . . . the Mexican administrative departments and the Mexican courts . " <P> Thus the Department warned U. S. oil men that if they do not choose to abide by the Morrow-Calles status quo , created last week , they can no longer count on State Department aid in bucking the Calles hegemony in Mexico . <P> The new regulations , boiled down from their several score articles , provide that : <P> 1 ) The rights held by foreigners in Mexican oil properties prior to the adoption of the Mexican Constitution of 1917 will be confirmed . <P> 2 ) This confirmation , which will be made to applicants prior to Jan. 11 , 1929 , will validate their rights in perpetuity , thus supplanting the system of 50-year-confirmatory titles which the U. S. contended was confiscatory . <P> 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. holders of Mexican lands in 1917 shall include " oil rights " only in case it can be proved that they performed some " positive act " showing that they were developing or proposed to develop their lands to produce oil . <P> Commented Ambassador Morrow , last week , on the subject of " rights " : " While there may well be honest differences on this point , there is no reason why any such differences can not be satisfactorily settled through due operations of the Mexican governmental departments and the Mexican courts . " <P> Clearly , Ambassador Morrow takes the large view that it would be futile to try to exact from Mexico the confirmation of " oil rights " to persons whose lands had shown no trace of oil in 1917-when Mexico embarked upon a Constitutional rgime definitely conserving future Mexican oil discoveries to Mexicans . <P> Ambassador Morrow 's important gain has been to secure apparent justice for those U. S. citizens who held bonafide Mexican oil lands in 1917 . <P> At Manhattan , last week , oil men awaited the Spanish text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of highest paid counsel before settling back in the comforting assurance that all is substantially well with oil in Mexico . <P>
