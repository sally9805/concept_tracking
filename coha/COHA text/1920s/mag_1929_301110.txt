Strange as the Ozark back country where it was enacted was the trial last week at Mountain View , Ark. of four " hill barons " indicted for the murder of Connie Franklin ( TIME , Dec. 9 ) . Prime witness for the defense was a gaunt , sun-reddened farmhand who swore he was Connie Franklin himself . <P> " He ai n't my Connie , " insisted woebegone , calico-clad Tiller Ruminer , on whose testimony the four-Herman Greenway , Joe White , Hubert Hester , Bill Younger-were indicted . She repeated her lurid story of a night last March when , as she and Franklin set out to be married , they were attacked by the defendants . She testified : " Connie yelled out ' Till , Till , they 're akillin ' me ! ' Then Joe White slammed a big rock on his haid . I could n't help him none because Greenway was adraggin ' me into the bushes . Then Hester came and helped Greenway do what he was doin ' to me . I went back later and seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Later , she said , the attackers informed her that they had killed Franklin and would kill her too if she told . <P> Another witness for the prosecution was a deaf mute who by finger twitches testified he had seen the four attackers carry Franklin toward a big log fire . The State , contending that Franklin was burned alive , exhibited as the corpus delicti a boxful of charred bones . Because a temple bone had inadvertently been mislaid a State health officer would not swear that the remains were human . The live " Connie Franklin " said that on the night of the " murder " he had started out with Tiller . He explained : " I fell off my mule-had a few too many swigs-and cut my haid . Next day I went away . That 's all they was to it . " Some witnesses felt that he looked " a lot like Connie . " The girl 's avowal that he was not her man was corroborated by others who knew him well . <P> The jury acquitted the four hillmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publicity given such dark doings in the Ozarks , protested widely that they were not typical of their State , cited big city bombings and murder as equally fearful . The acquittal at Mountain View was hailed as a vindication for Arkansas .
