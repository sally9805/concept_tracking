Dean Inge has often remarked that Anglo-Catholics are " unchurched " by Roman Catholics*and attempt to unchurch everyone else . Their present objective is to include in the Prayer Book much matter which is offensive to other Englishmen , Nonconformists as well as Anglicans . <P> Particularly , they hope to insert two festivals for permissive observance-the feast days of Corpus Christi and of The Falling Asleep of the Virgin Mary ( which corresponds to the Catholic ' Assumption " ) . <P> Last week , Sir Thomas Inskit , leader of the " Low " or " Broad Church " party , issued a manifesto hotly attacking the Anglo-Catholics . It is admitted the Prayer Book will stand revision , for it has scarcely been altered since the days of Queen Bess when it was finally adopted as a compromise between the High and Low Church parties of the day . But that it should be revised Catholic-ward is unthinkable to the majority of Britishers . The possibility of such an event arises chiefly from the fact that Parliament has relinquished much of its control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively strong . <P> The Church congress meets for decision in the autumn . Meanwhile , much strenuous religious debate-quite different from the Fundamentalist controversy , which England has long since abandoned-may be expected in the Kingdom of His Britannic Majesty and , indeed , in his Dominions Beyond the Seas . <P> <P> *The Roman Catholics will not have them because this historic church accepts no one except on its own terms .
