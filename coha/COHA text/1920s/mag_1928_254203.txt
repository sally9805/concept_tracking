Last week , two men prepared to debate . One was Alfred Emanuel Smith . The other was John Roach Straton , Manhattan pulpiteer , parson of Calvary Baptist Church . Why had the debate been arranged ? <P> The answer is , not vice , but the word vice , and especially the meaning of the word vice in the historically great tradition of U. S. Puritanism . Actually the word is simply a general term signifying the opposite of virtue . If habitual kindness is a virtue , then habitual unkindness is a vice . For all specific forms of vice , there are specific words : thus , profligacy , drunkenness , sadism , cannibalism , gluttony , venery , adultery , laziness , mendacity , cupidity . <P> But , when a U. S. preacher says " vice , " all of his listeners take him to mean sexual vice , or even more specifically fornication . There is little that a U. S. President or a State Governor or legislator can do about fornication except to avoid this sin himself . Indeed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of the ancient profession of prostitution , which is a commercialized and variously well or badly organized form of fornication-usually regarded as the lowest form . <P> A fortnight ago , Dr. Straton , in his evening sermon used the word vice . His point : " However clean , personally , the Democratic candidate may be , and however innocent he may have been of any deliberate intention to give aid and comfort to the forces of vice , lawlessness , and drunkenness , nevertheless , because he is the type of politician he happens to be and because his sympathies and the judgments of his heart are with the liquor crowd and the hangers-on of the liquor crowd , the forces of prostitution and gambling have , for the sake of truth , to be included with them , therefore it must be said that as a public man he is the deadliest foe in America today of the forces of moral progress and true political wisdom . " <P> Gov . Smith cared nothing for Dr. Straton 's opinion of his " true political wisdom . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had no desire to take time out on this subject with just one parson , however dry . But Gov . Smith has waited for a chance to get at and dispose of this matter of VICE . Whisperings throughout the country , and especially in the South , were trying and would try to connect him with VICE . The more the ordinary man got to life him , the more the ordinary woman might be alarmed . In some vague way , he was to be the symbol of sexual infidelity , of degrading pleasures which the virtuous woman feared more than beer . He was to be thoroughly confused with New York , and somehow all the vice ( sex ) of Broadway and the Bowery was to be imputed to him . <P> Now Dr. Straton has , especially in the South , great prestige . He is the big-city representative of small-town theology and morality . He would , of course , attack Gov . Smith . But he could not say that Gov . Smith is immoral . Detectives have for a decade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gov . Smith has never visited a brothel . Apparently Gov . Smith has never spent so much as an hour in compromising circumstances with any woman . Therefore , Dr. Straton 's attack must be " However clean . . . nevertheless . . . . " <P> So the Brown Derby wrote : <P> " Dear Dr. Straton :
