DODSWORTH-Sinclair Lewis-Harcourt Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> The Man . Samuel Dodsworth was , perfectly , the American Captain of Industry , believing in the Republican Party , high tariff , and , so long as they did not annoy him personally , in prohibition and the Episcopal Church . He was the president of the Revelation Motor Company ; he was a millionaire , though decidedly not a multimillionaire ; his large house was on Ridge Crest , the most fashionable street in Zenith ; he had some taste in etchings ; he did not split many infinitives ; and he sometimes enjoyed Beethoven . He would certainly ( so the observer assumed ) produce excellent motor cars ; he would make impressive speeches to the salesmen , but he would never love passionately , lose tragically , nor sit in contented idleness upon tropic shores . <P> To define what Sam Dodsworth was , at fifty , it is easier to state what he was not . He was none of the things which most Europeans and many Americans expect in a leader of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rotarian , not an Elk , not a deacon . He rarely shouted , never slapped people on the back , and he had attended only six baseball games since 1900 . He knew , and thoroughly , the Babbitts and baseball fans , but only in business . <P> While he was bored by free verse and cubism , he thought rather well of Dreiser , Cabell , and so much of Proust as he had rather laboriously mastered . He played golf reasonably well , and did not often talk about his scores . He liked fishing in Ontario , but never made himself believe that he preferred hemlock bows to a mattress . He was common sense apotheosized . <P> His Wife . Daughter of a beef-colored burgher , who had brewed his way into millions and respectability , Fran was . nevertheless , poised and luminous . She had been to Europe and to an Eastern finishing school ; she had born and bred two children ; aged 41 , she looked a decade younger , for her hair was ash-blond , her figure slim . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertained his friends . Her time was filled with clubs , committees , charities , and bridge ; but when Sam sold out his automobile business to a motor corporation , and was temporarily free , she declared her boredom and insisted upon being taken abroad . <P> Their Story . When they sailed , Fran knew what she wanted-romance , and a luxurious orgy of aristocracy , after the mediocrity of Zenith ; but Sam only knew that he 'd like to see the land of his ancestors , inspect the Rolls Royce and Mercedes plants ; then , refreshed , rush home to work at a motor caravan idea for campers , or a residential section for Zenith that should be guiltless of Tudor castles and Swiss chateaux .
