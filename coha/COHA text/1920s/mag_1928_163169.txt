Surrounded by friends , Miss Congo , young female gorilla , passed away last week at the John Ringling estate , Sarasota , Fla . For three years she had lived in the U. S. , and although her friends were many , she remained always solemn , quiet ; some said homesick for the sunny slopes near Lake Kivu in Belgian Congo , where she had been captured . The immediate cause of death was colitis , an intestinal disease often contracted by man , but not often fatal . <P> Miss Congo was one of the few young females in the U. S. who believed in the serious salon . Dr. Robert Mearns Yerkes , famed Yale psychologist , visited her in 1926 ; gave her many intelligence tests ; was impressed by her clarity of thought , her apparent willingness to cooperate . Other scientists were equally interested . A year and a half ago , Dr. Adolph Hans Schultz , anatomist of Johns Hopkins University , wrote to Dexter Fellowes of the Ringling Bros . &; Barnum &; Bailey Circus , asking for Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just beginning for the growing gorilla girl . She lived on the Ringling estate waiting to grow up ; then to step into a feature part on the Ringling program . Last week scientists at Johns Hopkins University waited eagerly for her dead body . They would dissect it thoroughly ; study it from the point of view of evolution , comparative anatomy , brain structure ; prepare the first complete study of the animal . <P> <P> Gorillas may languish in captivity but they do not necessarily die . Every death has its legitimate biological cause ; homesickness and heartache are not included . This is equally true of all other inmates of zoo &; circus . It has never been demonstrated that wild animals will die of captivity alone . Climate , food , disease are the three most powerful agents of death . Gorillas are much happier in southern lands , although they often adapt themselves to northern conditions . The New York Zoological Park has entertained gorillas for considerable lengths of time before sending them south ; the Philadelphia Zoological Park has a grave gorilla in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the proboscis monkey from Malaysia and the howling monkey from the tropics are a pair of supercilious snobs . Dr. Raymond Lee Ditmars of the N. Y. Zoological Garden has kept a howling monkey for three years only by pampering and coddling it , keeping it in a fine special cage , with " Vitaglass " windows to admit the ultraviolet ray . <P> Caribou and reindeer are extremely insistent on having the right climate ; the caribou will compromise somewhat on food , but the reindeer goes on a hunger strike unless it is fed reindeer moss , a delicacy difficult to obtain , and impossible to import . <P> Many birds settle down to a drab existence in captivity although in excellent health . The flamingo gradually loses its brilliant red color , turns an ugly grey .
