Fish . A new method has been developed whereby Norwegian herrings , Siberian sturgeon , faraway fish of every kind may be served in inland U. S. cities in the same luscious , savory , juicy state that they enjoyed when caught . The method consists of freezing so quickly and at so low a temperature that the flesh cells are not injured by ice crystals . The chemical composition remains the same ; there is no opportunity for bacterial development or decomposition . <P> Strictly fresh fish are cleaned , cut , packed . The packages are then placed in containers immersed in freezing solution , generally calcium chloride . An even later development is glazing the fish by spraying with cold brine and water before freezing . <P> Seeds . Recently Prof. William Frederick Gericke , associate plant physiologist at the University of California , announced that he could fertilize seeds with phosphate salts making fertilization of the soil unnecessary . For three years he has worked on the problem ; finally he developed a method of seed treatment on a large scale at low cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . Untreated barley seed in the same soil yielded no crop at all . <P> The phosphorus treatment is only one phase of the larger question of plant requirements . Plant Physiologist Gericke suspects that plants , like people , take more food than they need for growth . He has therefore , experimented with balanced rations , which led to a method of growing floral plants in water solutions containing only the essential growth elements . He has also developed a method of growing young tomato plants in cold frames ; feeding them special fertilizers ; producing a greater crop than the untreated controls .
