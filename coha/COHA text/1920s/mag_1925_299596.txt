The week in Italy was quiet . There were attacks by the Communists on Fascisti , by Fascisti on Communists , in which the Socialists were also implicated either as aggressors or defenders . Bombs , bottles and knives were thrown , bullets were fired , whips cracked as did bludgeons over heads , blood flowed and angry cries rent the air . Yet all was comparatively quiet . It was that the Opposition press had been effectually gagged ; that a hundred questionable politico-social clubs had been closed : that the urban and rural branches of the Italia Libera Association , of which General Peppino Garibaldi is head , were shut down ; that a number of subversive organizations had been rooted out ; that people had been terrified by many hundreds of domiciliary searches made by rowdy and violent Fascisti ; that scores of cafs had been forced to close their doors ; that hundreds of agitators , revolutionaries and other suspects had been hurled into jail . Benito Mussolini , Premier of Italy , had , as promised , pacified all Italy in 48 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept his word . The strange noises which were heard were only the dull thuds and thumps of a political Opposition that had temporarily been put out of harm 's way . <P> The Aventine* Opposition-group of about 150 Deputies of the Opposition which has boycotted the Chamber of Deputies since the Matteotti murder ( TIME , June 23 et seq. ) - seized a chance during this quietus to steal some of Benito 's thunder . <P> The leaders of this group made strenuous efforts to induce ex-Premiers Orlando and Giolitti to join them in their boycott , but they were rebuffed ; Signori Orlando and Giolitti declined to associate themselves with an illegal organization . The leaders went sorrowfully back to their Hill . Rumors were that the boycott was to be discontinued . <P> The Government thought to aid the Opposition in making up its mind about its next move . Accordingly , it was proposed in the Consulta to pay Deputies according to the number of sittings of the Chamber which they attended . ( Incidentally the cost to the country of paying Deputies would be cut some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to deprive the Aventine Deputies of the salaries which they are still drawing . <P> Next day , a grand session of the Opposition was held . They reaffirmed their position and , in a long and violent manifesto to the Italian people attacking the Government , made it clear that they had no intention of resuming their seats . The Italians , or the greater part of them , were not interested one way or the other in what the Opposition Deputies did or intended to do . They have , so to speak , lost caste . <P> * Classical name given to oppositional factions . Vide political clubs on the Aventine Hill during time of Cicero.
