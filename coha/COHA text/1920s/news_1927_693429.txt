txt Charlie Chaplin arrived in New York yesterday saddened and worried over the charges of his wife , Lita Grey , whom h- married as a 16-year-old girl four years ago . The jaunty manner , the sparkling smile were gone when he stepped from the Twentieth Century Limited yesterday morning . Instead there were telltale rings under his eyes , and his face bore a wistful expression which all his pleasant manner could not drive away . He sighed wearily whenever his wife 's accusations were mentioned , and he announced that he would file a counter-suit for divorce and fight " to the bitter end " to get custody of his two children , both of whom are now in Californil. with their mother . Last evening the comedian sat in the apartment of Nathan Burkan , his attorney , at 1.136 Fifth Avenue , and talked frankly and earnestly of the marital tangle and the divorce suit which resulted from it . " I feel completely crushed by these viperous , terrible accusations , " he said . " It 's cruel and unjustified  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this bitterness , except that I know it has been instigated by my wife 's family . She must be devoid of feeling , I guess . " " Are you still in love with your wife ? " Mr. Chaplin was asked . " How can one be , after such horrible accusations ? " he retorted . " I hardly think I can have any sane views on love at this time , when I 'm so close to this awful experience . " I see all around me happiness , tenderness , home life , sanity  --  all the things I love , and I am very much attached to children and home life . I like both my children  --  they are both very wonderful . I would n't say that I love one more than the other ; one may be more interesting than the other , but I love them both . Sees Stigma on Children . " That 's the tragedy of this whole thing  --  the stigma it has cast on their poor little lives . What I worry about most is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated I did love my wife  --  unfortunately . I expected a home , companionship , comradeship , an interest in one another and interest in the world outside ourselves , in the world around us . " Then Mr. Chaplin explained why he had married two such young girls  --  the first , Mildred Harris , and then Lita Grey . He said they inspired a " parental feeling , " and that " you can have the same companionship and love for them as for your children . " " Was it an intellectual companionship ? " he was asked . " I do n't think any one can be deeply intellectual at their age , " was the reply . " But I love many people , and there are some friends whom I love deeply . " The film star denied stories that he would retire from the screen and would even atop work on his forthcoming picture , " The Circus . " " 1 have only given up work on ' The Circus ' temporarily , " he explained , " until all this mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my life . Art and affection are essential parts of every man 's life . The combination of the two is what makes life  --  especially since art is often inspired by love . " He denied , too , the insinuations regarding Edna Purviance , who is still on the payroll of his company at $250 a Week , and minced no words in denying that on a railroad train he once said marrying Lita Grey was better than going to a penitentiary . " There is nothing between me and Miss Purviance , " he declared . " It is a terrible wrong to us both to say so . " Miss Purviance , he explained , was under a long-term contract with him , in accordance with his established practice when employing actors and actresses for United Artists pictures . " And as for that story about the train ride , it is a deliberate fabrication , false in every detail . " Mr. Chaplin declined to tell just when his love for Lita Grey began to cool . " Cruelty kills love , " he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . shall reserve that for the court , and I am reserving my cross-complaint against my wife for the proper time and place . I do n't understand the legalities of the thing at all . The whole case is a labyrinth of confusion . " Belies on Public Sense of Justice . Mr. Cnaplin said again and again that he was relying on the sense of justice of the American public to be with him in his present trouble . " Of course , I 'm not cheerful about it now , " he asserted . " But I am confident of the outcome . I have faith in the patience and sense of fair play of the people until I have a chance in court to tell my side of the story . " Earlier in the day Mr. Chaplin confronted a battalion of seventy reporters and photographers at the Grand Central when his train arrived , and , then walked out into a surging crowd of curiosity-seekers who were awaiting him in the main concourse . He strode quickly to a taxicab , breakfasted at the Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Park and up Fifth Avenue to Mr. Burkan 's apartment at Ninety-fifth Street . unrecognized by passers-by . At the train he submitted goodnaturedly to an inquisition by the newspaper men and women ' writers . who wanted to know chiefly what his counter-move would be . To them he announced his determination of a counter-suit and of custody of his children . He said estimates which placed his personal fortune at $16,000,000 were grossly exaggerated . " Would you call it six millions ? " one questioner suggested . Chaplin 's reply was , " You could call it half of that and you would probably be calling it too much . " The movie star will probably remain in New York for at least two weeks , settling business matters and planning his divorce action with Mr. Burkan.
