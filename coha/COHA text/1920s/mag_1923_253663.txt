Hitherto it has been impossible , it is said , to make successful gramaphone records of organ music , but the other day in a Chicago laboratory the feat was accomplished , by means of a device invented by Orlando R. Marsh . Pietro A. Yon played his organ composition Jesu Bambino for the records , and the reproduction is described as excellent . Mr. Yon is the organist of a Jesuit church in New York . This accomplishment seems to open a new field for the phonograph . <P> With the final notes of the season , the Chicago Symphony Orchestra technically ceased to exist . The musicians would not renew their contracts because the trustees refused a wage increase . They demanded $67.50 per week instead of $60 . In 1916 , they received $35.
