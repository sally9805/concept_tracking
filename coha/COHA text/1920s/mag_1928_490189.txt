lorifying the Bird Bath ivus ? Noble Setback new floral features . To them , as to all lovers of al fresco adornments , the pending exhibition of the New York Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects will have especial appeal . This , the fifth annual exhibition , will open at the Arden Gallery , 460 Park Avenue , on March 19 . Over one hundred photographs of the members ' work will be supplemented by appropriate sculpture and garden furniture . The scope and range of landscape architecture is little appreciated by many . As the chairman of the Exhibitions Committee , Mr. Nod Chamberlain , says : " Contrary to popular legend , the art of landscape architecture , even in the days of M. Le Notre , consisted of more than a window-box and a bird bath . Today , race tracks , baseball fields , public parks , real-estate subdivisions , both formal and informal , and even cemeteries are the problems and the accomplishments of the landscape architect . " I have had a preliminary view of some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recommend the show , comprising , as it does , the work of the most serious and best trained men and women in an important profession . EVERY day new buildings are completed but when three old ones fall down , well , that is news . I walked down Eighth Avenue to view the remains of the trio of dwellings that fell into the subway . They expired most gracefully , saving the wreckers a lot of trouble . There was little in evidence but a pile of bricks with a cloud of dust still hovering over it . I was pleased with a sign on an adjoining building , " Barber Shop Moved Around the Corner . " Certainly , nothing could be fairer than that . Eighth Avenue , by the way , is on the edge of a renaissance . Big buildings are shooting up on many plots of the hitherto unimproved property . One of the largest is the new Lincoln Hotel , a fourteen-hundred-room hostelry , engineered and built by the Chanin Construction Company . In its exterior phases , it struck me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tall steel sign on the central tower detracts considerably from the design . But I was amused and interested by the modernism of the public rooms on the main floor , the lobby , dining-room , and adjacent alcoves . It is quite successful and much of the detail is stimulating , especially the lighting fixtures in which the stab of direct lighting is avoided , but the general color scheme , particularly as related to the furniture , is confused and helter-skelter . The plans of the street level and the main floor which is above it are very ingenious , giving a large number of small shops . UCH the best architectural de- velopment which I gazed at in this neighborhood is the still unfinished Piccadilly Hotel on West Forty-fifth Street . It piles up nobly . The views of it from any angle are impressive and the whole exterior design goes with a swing . It was designed by George and Edward Blum plus Walter Katz and is a striking example of the adaptation of architecture to the setback law , accomplished with fine effectiveness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League is to be congratulated upon its recent exhibition which attracted many professional and lay visitors to Fifty-seventh Street during the past month . It was a sound , workmanlike show , well arranged and diversified in its appeal without being confusing . Architecture predominated , as it should , although sculpture , mural decoration , metal-work , and other allied crafts were not neglected . The medal of honor in Architecture went to Paul Cret of Philadelphia for his fine Museum of Art in Detroit . A large proportion of the architectural exhibits were illustrated by photographs and the development of this art as the architect 's handmaiden was impressive . Of course our own modern style , the so-called " American Perpendicular , " as applied to towering office buildings , was much in evidence , finely expressed by Hugh Ferriss and other skillful draftsmen . I was particularly thrilled by the beautiful grilles and gates , designed and executed by the E. F. Caldwell Company , in which the humor and playfulness of true craftsmanship were refreshing . In sum , it was a fine exhibition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its coherence and a sort of logical integrity of character .
