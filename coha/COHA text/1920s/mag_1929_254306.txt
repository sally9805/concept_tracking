Theologians have decided that it happened on a Friday , April 7 , 1899 years ago . At 3 o'clock the women and gamins who had climbed the hill , and the casual Roman soldiers who had gambled for the clothes , heard the words , " Father , into Thy hands I commend my spirit . " So brave , so peaceful was the death that even the Romans were troubled . Clouds gathered and there was an earthquake . . . . <P> It was a humane custom to break the legs of the crucified to speed Death . But Christ died on the cross . Nevertheless , nervously , impulsively , a Roman soldier pierced the body with his spear . Joseph the Arimathaean asked for the body and buried it in a tomb he had intended for himself , where no man had ever lain . <P> Three women went to the tomb on the first Easter Sunday . They were Mary Magdalene , Mary , sister of the Virgin and mother of the cousins of Christ . James and Joses , and Salome. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mother of James , saw an angel and Mary Magdalene saw two angels and saw and heard her Lord . The last miracle had not failed . The Pharisees soon heard the news they had feared : Christos kai apethane kai anesteh-Christ both died and rose . . <P> Timorous Christians had best not probe too deeply into Christian ritual . The flames of Christian candles may blend weirdly with druid fires . Behind a pure-throated Christian anthem may pipe the skirling music of an impish Pan . Mithras , the Persian sun god and onetime idol of the Roman army , was born on Dec. 25 . The Easter egg was symbolic before the Christian Easter , symbolic of fertility . <P> Easter to the American Indians is the feast of the renascence of Nature . March is the **36;6863;TOOLONG .

Not to be confused with Salome , daughter of Herodias , who danced for Tetrarch Herod and asked for the head of John the Baptist . But Dancer Salome could have witnessed the resurrection , since her famed dance took place only 13 months before it .
