Sul : About two months ago I mailed to every United States Senator a letter asking whether they considered the Fifteenth Amendment ( " the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude " ) less sacred than the Eighteenth ; why Congress should appropriate ; 30,000,000 in one year to enforce the Eighteenth and not one cent to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment ; whether they would support legislation to enforce the right of colored citizens to vote . I received in all six replies . Senator Borah writes that the Fifteenth Amendment can not be enforced on account of its phrase " by any State , " which makes all the difference in the world between it and the Eighteenth Amendment . Senator Fletcher of Florida writes that no Negro in his State or any other Southern State has ever been denied the right to vote . The remaining four Senators are just as unequivocal and clear-cut in their views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 14 A. A. GOLDEN From Mrs. Sacco To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Right after the legal assassination of my husband and of Bartolomeo Vanzetti the press spoke  --  and is now speaking  --  of groups , of organizations born here and there , with the compassionate purpose : some for the collection of funds for my maintenance and that of my children , made orphans by the plutocracy of the State ; some for the collection and publication of memoirs and writings of the two martyrs and of the various phases that characterized the seven years of persecution and torture ; some for erecting to them a monument ; and some more  --  as real jackals  --  using the names of Sacco and Vanzetti as an advertisement that would attract the multitude , for the sale of commercial articles , etc . Companions and friends from France write and send to me newspaper articles that mention subscriptions opened for the families of Sacco and Vanzetti . While I thank those who , in these years of atrocious Calvary , disinterestedly took to heart the fate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my children deprived of assistance , I can not remain in silence and therefore protest against whatever is speculation as an offense to their memory and to the principles for which they made the supreme sacrifice of their young lives . If the nobility and wisdom of many people of high standing had turned into a struggle against the present system and social order , in order to make impossible , in the future , the repetition of fearful crimes such as that accomplished on August 23 by the State of Massachusetts , they would have obtained the acknowledgment and applause of the good . But , since many of these people are at the same time backers of that same system of things that prosecuted , tortured , and assassinated my husband and his companion , Bartolomeo Vanzetti , this arouses disgust if not contempt . Always thanking the friends from France for their- good intentions , allow me to say that the names of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti would be better remembered if action and work are dedicated to the defense of the persecuted and condemned victims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty of the peoples that in Europe  --  as well as in the rest of the world  --  are choked and ruined . Boston , Massachusetts , November 3 ROSINA SACCO The Perils of Paris To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : In your article from Paris dealing with the visit of the American Legion I was surprised to read some severe remarks on their conduct here . I was not in close contact with them , but as I observed them in the streets and public places they seemed to be very well-behaved . I thought a good many of them were in low spirits . They used to hang about the sheds in the Cours la Reine in a disheartened sort of way . I think many of them probably realized for the first time since the war that nine years have passed since the armistice was signed . They were not prepared for the Paris of today  --  the hard , violent city which is not only utterly different from the Paris before the war , but from the Paris during the war , the Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank wine on their visit , as they had a perfect right to do . The French would have been very much hurt if they had not . Personally , I never saw one of them drunk , or even in an exuberant mood . I should not suppose that , taken as a body , they spent much money here . The French commercial class , as shrewd a lot as there is in the world , had discounted their visit before they arrived . " The legionaries are not the kind of Americans who spend money in Paris , " was what the shopkeepers and hotel-keepers said . The French Government spent several million francs to entertain the Legion . I very much doubt if the money spent by the legionaries in Paris came near covering this outlay of the city of Paris for their entertainment . While on the question of conduct of Americans in Paris , I would call your attention to something very singular . Many of your readers have heard Ambassador Herrick 's celebrated remark about Lindbergh . " Lindbergh left Paris as pure as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " purity " of Lindbergh , and the danger for him in the temptations with which Paris is supposed ? I do n't know why  --  to be infested , received a good deal of attention from specialists in these matters . But now comes Miss ( or Mrs. ) Ruth Elder here along , and not a word have we heard about the dangers of Paris for her . There are now several American Protestant churches in Paris . On the Sunday Ruth Elder passed here I could not of course go to all of them , but I managed to go to three . I was much disappointed . There was some perfunctory allusion to the Elder performance , but not one minister thought fit to lecture her about the snares spread round her feet , or to enjoin her to leave Paris as pure as she entered it . Do they think Mrs. Elder is better able to take care of herself than a big , husky fellow like Lindbergh ? And yet Lindbergh lived in Mr. Herrick 's family , and went to bed at ten every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a man who is not her husband , and did not go near a church on Sunday . Do the ministers think she is past saving ? Or that she is in no need of advice ? Anyhow , it is very strange that it is the young man who is so jealously guarded and sedulously kept on the right track and not the young woman . The New York Herald Tribune ( Paris edition ) which has become quite wowser of late years and runs the Rev. Dr. Cadman 's advice on the editorial page , even suggested that she should see some of the " night life " of Paris  --  whatever that is . It is not the night life in the Salvation Army barracks , at any rate . It was as much as any one 's life was worth to mention the word " night " in connection with Lindbergh . I thought of sending him Young 's " Night Thoughts , " but counsels of prudence prevailed . Covering the Legion visit was a certain amount of big melodrama stuff . The ash-tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his head to manufacture and distribute an ash-tray with a picture of a legionary dancing with a naked woman . Nobody took much notice of it till it was spied out by a reporter of l'CEuvre . Immediately Gustave Tery , the editor , loosened up his big batteries . The thing was an insult to the French woman , the French mother . Other papers joined in . The manufacturer was hunted out , and as he proved to be a Swiss or German he was expelled . Yet the idea , after all , was harmless enough . It was simply a rather vulgar way of letting the Legion know that they were in for a great time . And who is to say that the woman was meant to be French ? Every nationality , including Americans and Japanese , are to be found in the dancing and supping places nowadays . The night cabarets , which are , I suppose , the high spots the New York Herald thought Ruth Elder might visit , are often run by a Greek or other Levantine , manned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Russians , as well as Persians , Armenians , Finlanders , and Magyars , with a Frenchman as landlord , and sometimes  --  though rarely  --  the cashier French also . As long as his rent is punctually remitted the French landlord does not trouble about what the " barbarians " do in his house . The English papers were much amused at the care the French police took to purify Paris for the Americans . But the truth is that the measures were necessary for the protection of the decent people of Paris . Paris , France , November 3 VINCENT O'SULLIVAN Through Sports to Peace ? To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : For the first time I find myself in entire disagreement with one of your editorials . I , too , would feel gloomy about the peace mission of sports had I not participated in international contests in many countries . American school-children are drilled and trained to be biased and prejudiced in sports and this partisanship sometimes finds painful expression in international games , creating the impression abroad that Americans are not good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1920 at Antwerp a group of American Boy Scouts were instructed to give an American yell before each trial , concluding with the name of the representative of the United States . The yell was repeated in a fortissimo after an American victory , but the boys were silent after a defeat . But the atmosphere changed rapidly ; in those days many a prejudice was broken down and many friendships established across national and color lines . After the great explosion of a chemical factory in the Rhineland in the summer of 1921 the Groupement sportifa sport association of civilian Frenchmen working in German occupied territory  --  organized a sports meeting for the benefit of those who had suffered . This meeting , attended by German and French civilians , and officers and privates of the French army , contributed substantially to a better feeling between Germans and French . Football games between German and French civilian teams subsequently became an ordinary occurrence in the Rhineland . I regard the German sport movement also as an expression of revolt against the rigid regimentation of the old Turnvereine . Sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there more than anywhere else sport , with its international competition , is something approaching a " moral equivalent for war . " Some years ago it was the custom to send warships as good-will . messengers ' to-other - countries ; today athletic young men fulfil such missions with greater effect . conceptions of Finland and the Finns have been dispelled by the visit to these shores of such splendid athletes and fine sportsmen as Kohlemainen , Ritola , and Nurmi . Did not Lindbergh , Chamberlin , and Byrd and his companions prove themselves splendid ambassadors ? Competitive sports in the United States of America are keen , hard , and ruthless . Great publicity , social prestige , scholarships , remunerative positions , " political jobs , " all make losing hard . There is little sport for the joy of it . Fortunately in the rest of the world , where sports have not been commercialized to any great extent , people still can and do play , and that is why I can see an avenue through sport to peace . Paulsboro , N. J. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : My son , a student at Hamilton College , writes me : Tuesday we took our political-science field trip into Utica . And what a raucous time we had ! We certainly got all the first-hand details . I was sent to one of the polls to solicit Republican votes . No attention was paid to the 100-foot rule and we even had representatives inside the building . The chief function of the ward committeeman was to appear at stated intervals with a bottle of Scotch and disperse the same . Even the policemen came in for that . Votes were bought left and right , the top price being two bucks . Our man won , rather unexpectedly , and you should have seen the Republican Club that night ! Most of the men were propped up against the wall , and I guess they had to pour some officials into bed . It 's a great town . Albany , N. Y. , November 25 WILLIAM PATER For Greco and Carillo To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was chairman of an American committee of defense . I am happy to announce that Italians and Americans interested in the case have been able to set up one joint committee on which every radical and liberal group , party , or faction interested in the case has been able to unite . To those who know the strength of feeling that often divides us the achievement of this unity must seem a good omen worthy to rank with Clarence Darrow 's consent to take the case . Nevertheless this is no time for false confidence . Those who demand victims , even innocent victims , to satisfy their lust for revenge for the murder of two Fascists in the Bronx on last Decoration Day are relentless and unscrupulous . Not for one minute do we suspect that the trial judge who will sit when the case begins on December 5 will be a second Webster Thayer . Unfortunately , in these cases involving a necessarily expensive defense it takes more than a fair judge to save poor , radical , alien workers from a frame-up . A conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a small sum to deliver us from a repetition of such anguish as we knew in the Sacco-Vanzetti case and to save American justice from another such tragic blight . Of this united Greco-Carillo Defense Committee Robert Morss Lovett is chairman , Arturo Giovannitti vice-chairman , Marguerite Tucker secretary , Filipo Greco treasurer , and Stuart Chase auditor . We are happy to announce that the editor of The Nation is one of its members . Temporary offices are at 70 Fifth Avenue , where your contributions will be promptly acknowledged . New York , November 28 NORMAN THOMAS " Liberty Under the Soviets " To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Since writing my article on Liberty Under the Soviets I have learned of a half dozen cases in 1922 qualifying the general statement that no anarchists have been executed since the civil wars stopped . The executions were for " banditry " without trial in court , but the activities of these anarchists clearly had nothing to do with bandits .

Denmark To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : I find myself caring less and less how it seems to Heywood Broun . From the greatness of his name when he was with the World , I was expecting something when he joined the staff of The Nation . But Bruce Calvert , from his Pigeon Roost , can utter platitudes with twice as much kick . I think The Nation got gypped . New Braunfels , Texas , November 1 PHILIP N.

Copenhagen , Denmark , October 29 GLADYS SOUTHARD To Readers in Chicago and Hamburg To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Believing that readers of The Nation have a great many interests in common , a group of men and women in Chicago have formed a fellowship whose object it is to get together for the interchange of ideas on , and to stimulate an interest in , civic , political , and educational problems , and to meet socially . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may be interested in such a group , write to the undersigned , 7217 Yates Avenue , at once , as a meeting is to be held very shortly .

FRED Runson Hamburg , Germany , November 11 This Unbelieving Nation To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : I do not write to The Nation with the least desire or expectation of having anything printed that I write but simply to satisfy myself . You interest me greatly and I read , mark , learn , and inwardly digest what you print , and do not believe one word of it . Why ? Simply because you are on the side of the poor , the oppressed , and the exploited ! For my part I hate the poor ! Damn ' em , they only make me uncomfortable by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lain at the heart of all social evolution . All history is but the story of the struggle between those who have and those who have not . I trace it through all the life of Israel , and the prophets are ever fulminating against the rich and pleading for the poor . Jesus , the last of the prophets of Israel , did the same . The primitive Christians and the apostles sounded the same note The Nation is sounding today , and it never amounted to a row of pins and never will . Nothing amuses me more than people who tell me that their objection to The Nation is that it is so unbelieving and skeptical . God save the mark ! At heart you are a bunch of idealists , prophets , and primitive Christians . The mystery to me is where you get your courage for all this great faith you display !
