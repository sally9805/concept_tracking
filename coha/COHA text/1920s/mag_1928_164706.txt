There were three significant men at the fight : Jack Dempsey , 33 , who climbed into the ring before the fight , waved a straw hat , shook several hands , evoked the loudest cheer of the evening and such remarks as : " There 's a real guy , a colorful guy , for yuh . " James Joseph Tunney , 30 , pundit , who again demonstrated that the public can be damned , that he is the cleverest heavyweight boxer since " Gentleman Jim " Corbett , that he also has a punch which might well dispute Dempsey 's reputation as peerless killer . Henry Ford , 65 , who had a good time and whom few people noticed . Also present was Thomas Heeney , 29 , hairy-chested blacksmith from New Zealand , who had never before been knocked out by a man 's fist . He was beaten , that night last week at the Yankee Stadium , by terrific punches to his heart , by jabs and hooks which made a bloody mush of his nose and left eye . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock from Downunder " was being chewed . And then his jaw , game and unchewed , received a blow which caused the heavy sound upon the canvas of a falling body . Several seconds passed and what was left of Heeney remained almost motionless . Then the gong rang , ending the tenth round . Heeney 's seconds carried him to his corner , poured water on him , rubbed him , wiped some of the blood off his face , got him on his feet for the eleventh round . Courageously , he delivered two or three blows , but received a dozen which made his knees bend and his back feel the ropes . Referee Edward Forbes , night sports-editor on the Brooklyn Eagle , stepped forward and stopped the fight , awarding Champion Tunney what is called a technical knockout . Heeney 's head was drooping and there was a liquid in his eyes in addition to blood . Tunney went over to him , put two arms on his shoulders , said : " Tom , you are a game man . " . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaining that the radio was ruining his business and threatening to bar broadcasting in the future , announced a fight deficit of $155,719 .
