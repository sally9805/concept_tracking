Half of Thomas Hardy THOMAS HARDY , it is not surprising to learn , had not sufficient admiration for himself " to record his recollections , " and not enough interest in himself to brood over his own character . " A naturalist 's interest in the hatching of a queer egg or germ is the utmost intro ? spective consideration you should allow yourself , " he wrote , and the observation was made in a pocket book which nobody but himself was to read . Hence , though he was forced to agree that a life of him must be written ( " The Early Life of Thomas Hardy , " by Florence Emily Hardy . New York : Macmillan ) it is by his wish a life so devoid of artifice , so simple in its structure , that it re ? sembles nothing so much as the talk of an old man over the fire about his past . Much of it , indeed , was written down by Mrs. Hardy as he spoke it . Many of the phrases are unmistakably his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symmetry is more than made up for by the sound of the speaking voice and the suggestiveness which it carries with it . Indeed , by no other method could Mrs. Hardy have kept so close to her husband 's spirit . For Hardy was the last person to be subjected to the rigors of biography . Never was anyone less stereotyped , less formalized , less flattened out by the burden of fame and the weight of old age . He sprang up , effortlessly , un ? consciously , like a heather root under a stone , not by im ? posing his views or by impressing his personality , but by being simply and consistently himself . Everything he wrote ? it is a quality that makes up for a thousand faults ? had this integrity ingrained in it . One finds it again per ? vading his life . Fantastic as it sounds , one can scarcely help fancying that it was Hardy who imagined it all ? the fiddling father , the mother who loved reading , the house " between woodland and heathland " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sedgemoor and its ( ( spent social energies " who had come down in the world ? " So we go down , down , down , " said Hardy , meeting the head of his family trudging beside a common spring trap in the road . Everything takes on the color of his own temperament . His memories have the quality of moments of vision . He could remember coming home at three in the morning from fiddling with his father ? for the Hardys had fiddled in church and farm for generations without taking a penny for it , and little Tom was a dancer and a fiddler from his birth ? and seeing " a white human figure without a head " in the hedge ? a man almost frozen to death . He could remember the farm women at the harvest supper " sitting on a bench against the wall in the barn and leaning against each other as they warbled : Lie there , lie there , thou false-hearted man , Lie there instead o ' me . " He could remember how his father would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heath alone with the telescope that had belonged to some seafaring Hardy and " stay peering out into the distance by the half-hour . " He could rememlizr how once he stood there too and put the same brass telescope to his eye . He saw a man in white fustian on the gallows at Dorchester who at that moment " dropped downward and the faint note of the town clock struck eight " ; and he seemed alone on the heath with the hanged man . But more distinctly than anything else he could remember lying on his back as a small boy and think ? ing how useless he was and how he did not wish to grow up ? " he did not want at all to be a man , or to possess things , but to remain as he was in the same spot , and to know no more people than he already knew about half a dozen . Yet . . . he was in perfect health and happy circumstances . " So the memories succeed each other , like poems , visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Hardy 's mind worked when it was most at its ease , falling fitfully and capriciously like a lantern swinging from side to side and lighting now a rosebush , now a frozen tramp . He has none of that steady and remorseless purpose that some people would attribute to him . It was by chance that he saw things , not by design . He puts the telescope to his eye and there is a man on the gallows . He walks in Dorchester High Street and sees the gipsy girls with their big brass earrings in the light from a silver-smith 's shop . At once these sights shape themselves into poems and set themselves to some old tune that had been running in his mind . He stops to meditate . He can not hold firmly on his way . Indeed , he did not want to possess things ; he " cared for life only as an emotion and not as a scientific game . " Hence the doubts and the fluctuations of his career . He might have gone to Cambridge , had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fumbled about with architecture , pulling down the old churches that he loved and building new ones . Now he was going to devote himself to poetry , now to fiction . One result of this vacillation seems to have been that he was singularly open to influence . He wrote a satirical novel in the manner of Defoe , and because Meredith advised him to write another with a more com ? plicated plot , he sat down and wrote " Desperate Remedies " with a plot like a medieval mousetrap . When the Specta ? tor said that the novel ( because there is a rich spinster in it with an illegitimate child ) was rightly anonymous , for even a nom de plume might " at some future time disgrace the family name , and still more the Christian name , of a repentant and remorseful novelist , " Hardy sat on a stile and wished himself dead . It was in deference to another critic , John Morley , that he wrote " Under the Green ? wood Tree " in the pastoral manner ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said that he was a house decorator that he put aside the first version of " The Wood ? landers " and proved his sophistication by writing " The Hand of Ethelberta . " All this deference to authority which contrasts so queerly with the perfectly uncompromising character of his genius comes , no doubt , from some inertness of temper in the descendant of a spent race ; but it rose , too , from a fact which Hardy himself noticed , that he came to maturity much later than most men . His gifts lay hidden far longer than is usual . Poems dropped now and again into a drawer . But the desire to write poetry seems to have been fitful and dubious even when he was at the most poetic age . Bread and butter had to be earned , and therefore , re ? luctantly and hesitatingly , without the illusions or the hot ? headedness of the born novelist , he stumbled into a calling for which he had little respect , and for which , if he had magnificent gifts , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well to write novels like " Far from the Madding Crowd " upon chips of wood or white leaves or even stones out of doors , he was persuaded that a novelist , to be successful , must describe manners and customs . He must frequent dinners and clubs and crushes . He must keep a note-book . And so , though he could not bear the touch of an arm on his shoulder , and a note-book in his pocket made him " as barren as the Sahara , " he faced the position squarely ; he rented a house in Upper Tooting ; bought a note-book and dined out nightly . " Certainly , " exclaimed Miss Thackeray , when he consulted her upon the matter , " a novelist must necessarily like society ! " Society seen from Upper Tooting looked a little queer . He put the brass telescope to his eye and saw the strangest things . He mused upon the passions and sorrows that raged beneath the breasts of the crowd at the Marble Arch . He lay in bed at Upper Tooting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a monster who had four million heads and eight million eyes . " He sat next Lady Carnperdown at dinner " and could not get rid of the feeling that I was close to a great naval engagement . " But he also noted down the correct things . He met Matthew Arnold , who " had a manner of having made up his mind upon everything years ago " ; and Henry James , " who has a ponderously warm manner of saying nothing in infinite sen ? tences " ; and old Mrs. Procter , " who swam about through the crowd like a swan " ; and Byron 's Ianthe , " a feeble beldame muffled up in black and furs " ; and the Carnarvons and the Salisburys and the Portsmouths ? and of all this he took note as a novelist should . And when the books were finished , he did whatever the editors required him to do to make them salable . Book after book appeared in magazines with passages cut out or with incidents put in to please the British public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing was " The Mayor of Casterbridge " ? was " mere journey work , " did it very much matter what compromise he made ? Fiction was a trade like another ? off he went to the Crawford-Dilke case , note-book in hand . Yet now and then the note-book would record a state of mind or a thought that was quite unsuitable for fiction . For instance , " . . . when I enter into a room to pay a simple morning call I have unconsciously the habit of re ? garding the scene as if I were a specter not solid enough to influence my environment ; only fit to behold and say , as another specter said , ' Peace be unto you ! ' " Or again he mused , " people are somnambulists ? that the material is not real ? only the visible , the real being invisible optically . " For while with one half of his mind Hardy noted down what a successful novelist ought to observe , the other half peered over his shoulder and turned these observations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second half ; he might have succeeded in writing agreeable cynical novels of London life , like any other . But that obstinate conviction that made him , for all his efforts , an outsider , that faculty for putting the telescope to his eye and seeing strange , grim pictures ? if he went to a First Aid lecture he saw children in the street behind a skele ? ton , if he went to a French play he saw a cemetery be ? hind the players ' heads ? all this fecundity and pressure of the imagination brought about at last not a compro ? mise but a solution . Why run about with note-books observing manners and customs , when his mind involun ? tarily flooded itself with strange imaginations and sung itself scraps of old ballads ? Again the note-book records certain ideas that would be out of place in a novel . " The ' simply natural ' is interesting no longer . The much decried , mad , late-Turner rendering is now necessary to create my interest . The exact truth as to material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see the deeper reality underlying the scenic , the expression of what are sometimes called abstract imaginings . " But how far can abstract imaginings be expressed in a novel ? Will not realities fatally conflict with that observation of manners and customs which Hardy , so simply and so modestly , had accepted as the staple of the novelists ' trade ? The first half of Hardy 's life ends with that note of , interrogation . We have reached the year 1891 . He la , written " Tess of the D'Urbervilles . " It has appeared ici the Graphic . At the editors ' request , Hardy has omitted the christening scene ; he has allowed the dairy-maids to be wheeled across the lane in a wheelbarrow instead of being carried in Clare 's arms ; and , although one father of daugh ? ters still objects that the bloodstain on the ceiling is in ? decent ? " Hardy could never understand why " ? the book is a great success . And what , we ask ourselves , is going to happen next ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IR : May I reply to the letter under the caption , " Is Prohibition a Local Issue ? " by Dorr H. Carroll of Kansas City , Mo. , in your issue of November 14 ? I am a traveling man and cover the greater part of the United States and have found one may procure liquor in any village , town or city , when one so desires . In the Baptist-dominated South , where the issue in the election was the liquor question , the situation can be summed up in the saying , " Prohibition is better than no liquor at all . " In one of the large hotels , in a leading Texas city , the manager gave me the name of his private bootlegger . At the recent American Legion convention in San Antonio , liquor was as easy to obtain as a pair of number 7 shoes . In New Orleans , one merely has to ask for it . In Florida , bootleggers are thicker than real-estate agents used to be . A similar situation exists in every section of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States is impossible until the entire world accepts it ? As long as Canada is wet on our north , Mexico on our south , as long as there are hills in West Virginia and Tennessee , as long as houses have basements and humans crave whiskey , we can never have complete prohibition . . . .

We also believe that it is these very second-raters who most often attempt to perpetrate " readings " on the public , and we like our Beethoven straight . As to rehearsals ( and here is a scoop for the New Republic ) , we had more than the sixteen or twenty rehearsals that the various papers gave us credit for . If the sectional rehearsals be counted , we had more than twenty-five . But the first twenty of these were chiefly to perfect the ensemble , just as a string quartet sometimes plays together for a year without appearing in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fair and our strings were really admirable " ( we 're very proud of that ) this was due to the first twenty rehearsals . We shall not need as many for our future concerts . The first of our subscription series of three will take place on January 5 . On that date , we plan to play ( here 's another scoop for the New Republic ) a Prokofieff Piano Concerto , surely a departure from the " highly conventional . " Obviously we can not have the 120 rehearsals that Mr. Taylor 's mathematics finds necessary between now and January 5 . The outstanding thing about the entire experiment is the fine spirit of the musicians themselves . It was an inspiring sight to see them rehearse enthusiastically at midnight , as they were sometimes compelled to do , after a day of teaching or of playing at odd jobs . They feel that , with work and patience , they can give worth ? while concerts to the music-lovers of New York . They hope eventually to make these concerts self-supporting . The players do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has the power , if he quits paying the deficits , to relegate them to movie theaters and restaurants .
