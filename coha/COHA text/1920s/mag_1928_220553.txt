The University of Wisconsin stands for free speech . Affixed proudly to the wall of its Bascom Hall is a bronze tablet celebrating " that fearless sifting and winnowing by which alone the truth can be found . " <P> But the University of Wisconsin will not stand for loose speech . The following speech is considered immoral by the University of Wisconsin : " I believe in two or three companionate marriages before one settles down . How else can one be sure unless one has experimented ? A woman should always experiment before marriage , just as a man does . There should be no need to lie about it . " <P> Such was the fine distinction that emerged last week from a perplexed and not unamusing situation in Madison , Wis . The soul-stirring subject of " companionate marriages " had been filling periodicals of the high-minded kind for which President Glenn Frank of the University of Wisconsin writes articles . Eager intellects of the Wisconsin Student Forum heard that the wife of famed Philosopher Bertrand Russell of England was coming to the U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fearless , " " astounding " and rather trite book , The Right to Be Happy . The Student Forum invited Mrs. Russell to lecture on " Companionate Marriages " and looked forward to hearing a " vital and significant message " - until it learned the kind of thing Mrs. Russell would probably say , as quoted above . <P> Shocked by the insouciance of Mrs. Russell 's " experimental " attitude toward sex , startled into realization of what polyandry might mean if honestly recognized at a co-educational institution , Students Frederick Hyslop and Frederick Joachim of the Forum went to President Glenn Frank , asked him what they had better do . <P> " I gave it as my opinion , " said Dr. Frank later , " that Mrs. Russell had indulged in an exhibition of very bad taste and said that if I were a member of the Student Forum I would not favor bringing her to address a mixed audience . " <P> So Mrs. Russell 's lecture was cancelled and the Student Forum breathed more freely , having escaped the blushful consequences of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's broad avenue of free speech . In their excitement , however , the students quite missed Dr. Frank 's subtler point and announced that the cancellation was on " moral " grounds instead of the less debatable ground of good taste .
