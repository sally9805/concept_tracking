Miniature portraits in wax are no novelty . They were a favorite genre in the 16th Century , and have always been a popular stunt because the medium lends itself to such palpable imitation of Nature . At present , one Mrs. Calcott of London is experimenting with a new method in wax . " She does not try to make her miniature 's lifelike and for that reason is more artistic . . . . " She says of her process that she uses pure White beeswax and melts the color into it . To a large extent she makes her portraits by taking casts of a clay or wax model , particularly because it would be so difficult to keep wax clean in London . Each color must be cast separately , the parts afterwards joined up with a hot tool . She has been especially successful in portraits of infants and small children where the delicacy of the flesh and coloring is beautifully rendered in the soft translucency of the wax .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
