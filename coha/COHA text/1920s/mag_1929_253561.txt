THE MAD PROFESSOR-Hermann Sudermann ( translated by Isabel Leighton and Otto P. Schinnerer ) - Horace Liveright , 2 vols. ( $5.00 ) . <P> The Mad Professor is not the swift motivated story one might expect from so incisive a dramatist as Sudermann . Rather it is a leisurely commentary on German University life , with its Bismarckian politics , Junker fraternities , duels and drinking bouts - everything , in. short , but intellectualism . To point the narrative Sudermann projects a philosophical genius into the stolid pussyfooting faculty , and predicates the dangerous futility of his in dependent thinking . That Professor Sieburth should have independent ideas strikes the faculty as bad enough , but that he should live his ideas is intolerable . <P> To fascinated students Sieburth had paraphrased Schopenhauer as " the World in Terms of Woman and Thought ' ' ; then proceeded to demonstrate the philosophy in person . His women he took indiscriminately from exclusive faculty circles or from the streets and brothels - one died of despair , another married out of spite , and yet another , jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissipated it in drunken orgies , then gave it up as futile ; killed himself . <P> If the particular history of Sieburth , genius , is unconvincing . Sudermann 's general thesis is none the less cogent . And his analysis of masculine reasoning , as op posed to feminine blind unreasoning , has an uncanny authenticity . <P> Son of a small-town brewer in East Prussia , Sudermann left school at the age of 14 , was apprenticed to a chemist , turned up nevertheless at Immanuel Kant 's university in Konigsberg . Sometime journalist in Berlin , he finally devoted himself exclusively to writing novels , and plays , provocative in their sociological significance - Die Ehre , Es lebe das Leben . He died last November , aged 71.
