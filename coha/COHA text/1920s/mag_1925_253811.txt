A towel- soggy , bloodstained , ragged-sailed over the top rope of the fight ring in Madison Square Garden , Manhattan . Sock ! it landed on the canvas , right at the heels of a battered little man with a streaming gash over his right eye . The little man was rocking to and fro under showers of blows from a furious , compact human whirlwind that flew now at his head , now at his ribs , now at his jaw , now at his pounding heart . <P> The referee , sorry for the battered little man , had been watching for the towel . As it struck , he stepped between the fighters . Friends rushed to the little man - he was a Featherweight Danny Kramer of Philadelphia- and helped him to his corner , beaten . The human whirlwind- he was Featherweight Louis ( " Kid " ) Kaplan of Meriden , Conn. - stood panting but jubilant while they raised his right hand aloft and declared that , by a technical knockout , he was winner , he was world 's featherweight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun some months ago by the New York State Athletic Commission to determine a successor to Johny Dundee , * former titleholder , who had been forced ( TIME Sept. 1 ) to admit he could no longer scale his weight down to 126-lb. maximum allowed for featherweights . Kaplan hit his way to victory in the ninth of 15 scheduled rounds , winning every round . <P> *Johnny Dundee 's real name is Giuseppe Carriorra . He was born in Sicily . Last week , he was received by Pope Pius XI-the first time such an honor has ever been accorded a pugilist . Said Mr. Dundee ( later ) to reporters : " That ought to bring luck . I hope I 'll knock out the next man I fight . "
