Time was , and not many years ago , when a subject of the Sultan was known as the " unspeakable Turk , " a phrase coined by Thomas Carlyle and afterwards much used in political parlance . <P> Last week the phrase received a new twist : Mustafa Kemal Pasha , president of the Turkish Republic , announced his intention of delivering , on October 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , a 400,000-word* speech over the radio reviewing in detail the history of the Nationalist government . <P> The text of the speech covers 1,200 pages , most of which will be read in the National Assembly before a microphone by the president himself . Many secretaries will be on hand , however , to aid him if he should become too hoarse and all official documents will be read by them . <P> Deputies were warned to be in Angora , capital of Turkey , not later than October 14 . <P> <P> * There are about 100,000 words in an average length novel .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
