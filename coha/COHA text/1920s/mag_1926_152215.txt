At Budapest three judges frowned upon a judicial bench stacked high with counterfeit French francs . Since trial by jury has now been abolished in Hungary , the jury-box - built - for - twelve was pressed into service to accommodate twenty-six defense attorneys . The twenty-four prisoners , who sat close together on three long benches , arose one by one as their names were called , and nearly all confessed to having taken part in counterfeiting the piles of banknotes , but stated proudly : 1 ) that they had done so by command of their superior officers ; or 2 ) that they had acted from the most disinterested patriotic motives . The forty-nine witnesses , including six Counts , two Barons , and one Bishop , fidgeted meanwhile , sniffed with disapproval the air of a courtroom jammed to suffocation . <P> Thus , there began at Budapest , last week , a trial as seemingly nonsensical as that of Alice in Wonderland : the trial of those Gargantuan Hungarians who counterfeited 30,000,000,000 French francs , allegedly with intent to finance a putsch which would overthrow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hungarian Throne . ( TIME , Jan. 18 et seq . ) <P> As the trial proceeded a big-boned , fiercely-bearded , swarthy prisoner was brought forward . Though he had the air of a proud and unrepentant brigand , he had been , up to the very moment of his arrest , the respected Dr. Nardossy , Chief of Police of Budapest . He pleaded " Guilty ! " in a booming voice . <P> " Dr. Nardossy , " queried the Chief Magistrate , Judge Toereky , " how did it happen that you conspired with Prince Ludwig Win-disch-Graetz ? How did he ever dare to broach this stupendous plan of forgery to you , the Chief of Police of Budapest ? " <P> " Why not ? We are old friends ! " roared Dr. Nardossy . " We are accustomed to talking over many things together . We have acted from completely patriotic motives . . . . ' <P> Judge Toereky prudently refrained from prying into the nature of these " motives . " Instead he called another prisoner , a dapper little man with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined young man , who clenched and brandished a cane in one hand while he gesticulated with the other . This was Prince Ludwig Windisch-Graetz , a descendant of the " Holy Roman Emperors . " <P> " Do you feel guilty , Your Highness ? " asked Judge Toereky . <P> " No , " said Prince Ludwig Windisch-Graetz ; " this was no common crime , but part of a great patriotic fight ... I had not the honor to originate this gigantic scheme ... a circle , the members of which I shall not name , prepared it , and merely called on me for financial aid , which I gladly gave . . . . " <P> Again Judge Toereky made no attempt to fix the purpose of the plot , since so much as to hint at the return of the Habsburgs might result in serious trouble with France . <P>
