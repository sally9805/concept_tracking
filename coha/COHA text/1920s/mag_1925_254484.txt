LUCIFER - George Santayana - Dunster House ( $15.00 ) . For the richest shelves of bookstores , for the glossiest library tables , for the nicest eyes and the longest thin fingers , some artisans in papers and inks and types have redecorated an older poet 's younger pantheon . When the veils are drawn , there is crimson chiseling . When the angels speak , their celestial words are of the blue of Heaven . The rarified text - five acts of lofty verse - is for high thinkers , telling the tragedy of imperious Lucifer , who sought to sustain his soul by tugging at his spiritual bootstraps.
