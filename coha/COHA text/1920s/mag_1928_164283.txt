To defend London , Britain last week tested , successfully , a tiny single-seated war plane capable of shooting up like a rocket , five miles up in ten minutes . The " Intercepter " plane , as it was known , is very light and requires a small pilot with the delicate touch of an expert horseman . <P> If Flier Clarence Duncan Chamberlin is not the cinema type , as reported , Miss Ruth Elder apparently is . The New York-to-Atlantic Ocean flier was besought by Florenz Ziegfeld last week to play the part of the American girl in his motion picture to glorify that young lady . <P> Imperial Airways , the only organization in Britain operating regular air routes , is to be subsidized by the Government until 1939 , when it is expected to pay for itself . Delhi , it was learned last week , is to be pushed as a new Indian terminus . Thus is success rewarded , for last year Imperial Airways carried 52,000 passengers 2,500,000 miles without accident to a single passenger . <P> A bold experiment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Royal Air Force airdrome at Martlesham Heath , some 75 miles northeast of London . Capable of carrying 20 persons , the ship was taken up by Squadron Leader J. Noakes and one mechanic , each wearing a parachute strapped to his back . The Inflexible has a wing spread of 150 feet and weighs fifteen tons-the world 's largest all-metal monoplane . Built on the Air Ministry 's orders , her purpose is a secret .
