txt Directly after the Senate vote on the World Court . : lir . BORAH and Senator , REED of Missouri announced that they would go out and campaign against every Senator who had favored our , joining the Court . At the time this was thought of as merely an explosion of temporary pique . It did not seem possible that the two men meant what they said . But they have shown that they are good haters , in the sense of ! being able . to keep their wrath hot for a month , and have actually ret out upon their enterprise . The immediate objectives at which they are striking are Senator MCKINLEY of Illinois and Senator LENIZOOT of Wisconsin . A new meaning will be given to " Senatorial courtesy " by this stretching of it to cover a violent attack upon Senators in their own States by two dearly beloved brethren from other Common-wealths , Senator REED 'S conduct occasions no particular surprise . He has been a sort of ostentatiously rough Orson of t he Senate . His hand is against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to hit a head wherever he sees it . The joy of strife is so strong upon him that he apparently does not much care what 11 he is fighting about so long as be is fighting . But Senator BORAH 'S case is different . He professes to be a man absolutely devoted to peace . Yet here he is declaring war to the knife on Senators who disagree with him . Mr. BORAH was very strong in his speech In the Senate on the duty of " abiding " by the judgment of a judicial tri " bunal . " But does he feel no obligation to abide by the decision of the Senate of which he is a member ? When he enters into a free and pro longed debate on a question within the competence of the Senate to settle , is he to be understood as refusing to submit to the majority and determined to take vengeance , or to execute punishtnent , upon those who venture to differ with him ? In another there is little doubt that Mr. BORAH would describe such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by himself , we suppose he would call it sweet reasonableness and the loftiest patriotism . Nevertheless , the question presses for answer what is expected by the application of this new-fangled Pride 's Purge to the Senate of the United States . Messrs . REED and BoRAH can not be so deluded as to think that they can bring about a reversal of the Senate 's action on the World Court . Even if they were able to defeat one-half of the Senators up for re-election , that would not suffice . And in their trail , if they continue to pursue it , they would leave so much resentment and bitterness and personal animosity that they could not hope to get any substantial number of Senators to agree with them or work with them in any important matter whatever . They will , of course , profess  --  especially will Senator BORAFI profess  --  the highest possible motives . But they will be judged by their acts and their results . And it would seem that their best friends ought to make haste to warn them , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public as bad losers and sad eTamples of what public men can become when they forget everything but their personal chagrin and spite and a desire to avenge themselves upon their successful adversaries .
