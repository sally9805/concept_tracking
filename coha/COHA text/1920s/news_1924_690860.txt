txt A $750,000 fire starting after an explosion on a barge of the Lambert Transportation company , docked on Staten isla.rid sound here , tonight caused the death of at least two men and injury to probably a dozen more . The barge and a steamship from which it was taking on a cargo of gasoline were destroyed . This is the third great tire on the Jersey waterfront in the last three days and suspicions of incendlarlsm are now believed entirely justified . The only person on the barge was its captain , Fred Myers of New York , who was apparently blown to pieces . A carpenter on the other ship also is missing . The tire raged throughout the night despite the efforts of all available tightIng forces . The boats broke loose and continued burning furiously as they drifted .
