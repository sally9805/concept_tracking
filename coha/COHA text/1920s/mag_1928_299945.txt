For feinting and footwork , a good boxing match is not a patch upon a national political campaign . Both parties have feinted several times already-the G. O. P. in the South , the Democrats in New England and the Midwest . Last week , biggest feint of the season , National Democratic Chairman Raskob visited that keystone of the Republican arch , Pennsylvania . Pennsylvania has not gone Democratic since the Civil War . It gave Hughes 200,000 plurality over Wilson , Harding 700,000 over Cox , Coolidge almost a million over Davis . Nevertheless , Mr. Raskob held happy conclave with Philadelphia Democrats and , as the New York Times put it , " gave them self-respect . " <P> It was a notable gathering that met at the Racquet Club . There were as many Republicans as Democrats , notably Charles Kendrick , brother of Freeland Kendrick , Philadelphia 's Mayor-before-last , and Robert Kelso Cassatt , son of onetime President A. J. Cassatt of the Pennsylvania R. R. Mr. Raskob succeeded in enrolling several of them on a Philadelphia citizens ' Smith-for-President committee headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. R. president , to combat the Hooverizing of the Pennsylvania 's present president , Gen. William Wallace Atterbury , Republican National Committeeman . Despair at G. O. P. Boss William S. Vare was one reason why many a Philadelphia Republican was ready to change party , but Mr. Raskob did not dwell on Vareism in his luncheon talk . Instead he talked about Nominee Smith as a " human engineer . " He talked about workmen and " good wholesome beer . " He said : " I think there is a feeling among the working people that Prohibition does not prohibit , but merely affects them , while those with better financial means are not affected by it . " <P> When he returned from Philadelphia to Manhattan , Mr. Raskob said : " It seems like claiming a lot to claim Pennsylvania for the Democrats but ... all I can say is that the tremendous enthusiasm in Philadelphia and in Pittsburgh ... etc. , etc . " A **26;10340;TOOLONG telegram was made public which Nominee Smith had received from Richard R. Quay , Pittsburgh businessman , son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss and Senator for 18 years and onetime National Republican Chairman . <P> Unlikely though it seemed that the Democrats ' Pennsylvania feint could be followed by a blow , the Republicans " covered up . " Passing through Pittsburgh , Nominee Hoover said : " Pittsburgh is a Republican stronghold , and we require all our strongholds in this contest . " Nominee Curtis planned to go this week to Harrisburg , Pennsylvania 's capital , and make a speech .
