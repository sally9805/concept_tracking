Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , First National Bank , New York , The National City Company , Guaranty Company , Bankers ' Trust Company , Kidder , Peabody &; Co. , Lee . Higginson &; Co. , Harris , Forbes &; Co. and Dillon . Read &; Co . The loan is the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the League of Nations for help . A committee , appointed by the League , studied Austria 's financial condition , imposed conditions upon compliance with which the floating of a loan would be undertaken and then obtained the appointment of Dr. Alfred Zimmerman , foriverly Burgomaster of Rotterdam , as commisbioner General for Austria , with powers bordering on the absolute over all affairs pertaining to the economic rehabilitation of Austria . American participation in the loan was obtained after a series of conferences between League representatives and Thomas W. Lamont , of the firm of I J. P. Morgan &; Co. , whose main consideration was that of security . To provide sufficient security to make the loan attractive to investors , the entire loan was guaranteed as to principal , interest and redemption payments by Great Britain , France .

Morgan issued the following statement : " The importance of the Austrian loan which is being issued today lies in the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are interested in helping those nations of Europe which are prepared to help themselves toward the re-establishment of their credit . " Last year at the bankers ' conference held in Paris . I stated that it was my opinion that if the security to be given was clearly good , and the investors of other lending nations would cooperate to the extent that they felt themselves able to do , I believed that the American markets would participate to an important extent in the rehabilitation of the European financial situation . At that time these conditions could not be satisfied . Now , however , for the first time a loan is offered which fulfils both conditions. , " The amount , while barge , is not excessive , and every present indication Justifies my confidence that we shall find the American investing public in accord with us in our belief that the new Austrian bonds are a good investment and that the extension of this rr credit is an important step on the road Ito peace and to normal trade . " Mr. Morgan was asked if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a German loan . This question he refused to answer directly , because , he explained , the reparations problem was still unsettled and the entire situation too inta.ngilbe to afford a fair analysis as to its possibilities from the ' stand ' point of a loan . Germany has not passed through so many processes as Austria , he suggested , and consequently is not in a position to present to prospective investors strong enough guarantees as yet to warrant a loan . Regarding the offering of the Austrian bonds , points were brought out in the circular . which contains a. formal statement from Dr. Zimmerman , which have not heretofore been published . It is shown . on the basis of the present rev enues from Austrian customs and her tobacco monopoly . that $30.000,000 annually is accruing from these sources against the *13,600,000 required annually for interest charges and sinking fund sufficient to amortize the loan by maturity . It also describes in detail the plan of rehabilitation , the conditions leading to its adoption and other points of interest to the investor . In part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Armistice to the Autumn of 1922. while Austria was struggling to establish its new democratic form of government on a working basis and to adjust its ? commie life to the conditions arising from the disruption of an economic unit which had been in existence for centuries . Government finances not unnaturally steadily deteriorated . Althoug'a Austria was the recipient of relief credits and gifts of supplies from abroad on a ! arge scale , all of the expenditures had been consumed for current needs , without any improvement in the country 's financial position . Inflation continued to increase and the paper crown steadily declined in value , due to the continuous issue of uncovered currency . The unsound currency situation had strongly deterrent effects on the revival of industry , which in turn , rebcted unfavorably on the Government 's udget receipts : in brief . Austria was in the grip of a vicious circle of cause and effect from w:iich it might have proved almost impossible for her to extricate jaersel t unaided . " The end of this period is marked by Heptember , - 922 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan for the financial and economic rehabilitation of Austria , formulated by the League of , Wations. was adopted by the representatives of the chief countries of Europe . The Plan of Rehabilitation . The basis for the plan is the political integrity and economic independence of Austria and the declaration ( Protocol No. 1 of Oct 4 , 1922 ) , designed to maintain it . Aided by the confidence which this declaration has crated , the Austrian Government has instituted a program of reform in order to ensure the balancing of its budget by the end of 1924 . This program of reform includes : The reduction of ministries , simplifying their organization and eliminating overlapping . This measure ig In an advanced state of execution , Reorganization or eventual transfer to private management of State industrial enterprises . The reduction in the number of State employes , the number of whom was reduced by about 30,500 between Oct . I. 1922 , and May 26 , 1923 , as part of the program for the release of 100,000 employes prior to July 1 . 1924 . The enactment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs duties and duties of other kinds and the introduction of a turnover tax . These measures have been introduced with success . - In the meantime , during this period of transition , the excess of the Government 's expenditures over the revenues available from normal resources , estiiliated at not to exceed about 500,000.000 Austrian gold crowns , will be met from the proceeds of the Austrian Government guaranteed loan . 1923-1943 . In addition , advances from several foreign ( =overnments , aggregating about 130.000. - 00 Austrian gold crowns and made in 1922 in anticipation Of this loan , are to be refunded with bonds of the loan , issued in the currencies of the respective lending countries . " In nation through note issues for the Government 's account definitely stopped on Nov. 18 , 1922 : since then additional notes have been issued only against cover in gold or in foreign balances in stable currencies . A ban of issue , independent of Government control and having the sole power of note issue and been established , with capital of 30,000 , - 000 Austrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Jan. 2 , 1923 . On the 23d of May , 1923 , its ratio of reserves ( gold and foreign exchange balances ) to note circulation ' lithe latter in paper crowns being calculated in gold crowns , according to the statutes of the bank , at the average rate of the preceding half year ) was mere than 35 Per cent . Crown Has Been Stabilized . " As a result of the monetary meastires taken , the Austrian crown has been Stabilized ; its exchange value , during the last seven months , has deviated hardly at all from the level established in October . 1922 . " A. protocol had been signed by the European Governments directly interested , including the neighboring States of Italy and of Czechoslovakia , to insure the economic and political independence of Austria . Under the terms of this protocol , No . I. , dated Oct. 4 , 1922 , the signatory States declared : ? That they will respect the political independence , the territorial integrity and the sovreig-nty of Autria ; that they will not seek to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or indirectly to compromise that independence . ' " The Government of the Federal Republic of Austria on its part : ? undertakes , in accordance with the terms of Article 88 of the Treaty of St. Germain , not to alienate its independence ; it will abstain from any negotiations or from any economic or financial engagement calculated directly or indirectly to compromise this independence . ' " The guarantee which has been given with respect to the bonds of this loan on behalf of eight of the principal nations of Europe gives these nations a very definite interest in assisting in the maintenance of Austria 's political and economic position . " The success of today 's offering will be closely observed by bankers and underwriting houses generally , who regard the issue as a sort of pioneer in the work of world reconstruction . The character of the entire investment market will be largely influenced and , if the present issue is quickly subscribed , it is expected other issues will be brought out . One feature of the Austrian reconstruction loan is that it sets a precedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-time enemy . For that reason it is regarded as a loan having sentimental weight as well as being a straight business proposition .
