Vote counting after the Japanese general election , last week , revealed at first glance only a disheartening deadlock between the two chief parties . Upon closer inspection a healthy trend was observed , away from the multiple bloc system which has been the curse of Japanese politics , and toward a two-party line up . <P> After the election of 1924 there were three principal parties , holding respectively 160 and 114 and 109 seats out of a House of 464 . Thus onetime Prime Minister Reijiro Wakatsuki was obliged to carry on with a coalition in which his party was but little larger than its chief supporting bloc . <P> Last week Prime Minister Baron Gchi Tanaka of the Seiyukai party obtained 221 seats . There appeared only one other party of comparable size , the Minseito , with 214 . Definitely inferior are the 16 Independents , the 8 Laborites , the 4 Business Party deputies , and the 3 members of the Kakushin Club . <P> Though neither of the Big Two has of itself a majority , Premier Baron Tanaka professed and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he needs to carry on , according to the official returns . The great facts are two : 1 ) This was the first Japanese election under the new suffrage law which increased the number of the electorate from 3,000,000 to some 12,000,000 ; 2 ) Of this new electorate 81% went to the polls and returned only two predominating parties .
