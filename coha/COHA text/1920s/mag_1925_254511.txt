On June 1 , the $48,000,000 of the 4% bonds of the Chicago , Milwaukee &; St. Paul R. R. mature and are due for payment . The St. Paul can not hope to refund this issue by going direct to its shippers as the New Haven has recently done , and must therefore look to its bankers- Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. and the National City Bank . Whether the road is due for a receivership this spring is unknown in financial circles . But the drastic decline in St. Paul stocks and junior bonds indicates Wall Street 's opinion that all is not well with the great northwest carrier . <P> The fundamental trouble with the St. Paul is overcompetition from the Great Northern , the Northern Pacific , the Canadian transcontinental lines and shipping lines through the Panama Canal . The northwest territory is overbuilt with railroads in proportion to its traffic needs ; and St. Paul , as the latest comer , has fared worst in competition . President Harry E. Byram naturally is preserving as cheerful a countenance concerning the approaching bond maturity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be extended or exchanged in some way so as to avoid a receivership . But , since the immediate crisis is financial , the real future of the St. Paul is probably in the hands of two bankers , Jerome J. Hanauer of Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , and President Charles E. Mitchell of the National City Bank of New York . Neither very naturally will talk for publication , and whether they will undertake to fund the aggravating loan of $48,000,000 can only be conjectured , But that they have hitherto proved reluctant to do so is a fair deduction from their waiting policy during a period when new security offerings have been readily subscribed , and when rising money rates have foreshadowed a temporary slump in prices for seasoned bond issues . <P> The St. Paul is not only the largest U. S. Railroad at present in financial difficulties , but one of the largest systems in the country .
