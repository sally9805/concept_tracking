Off to sunny Italy went Italian Ambassador to the U. S. Prince Gelasio Caetani . To reporters said he , apropos of the Matteotti murder ( TIME , June 23 et seq . ) : <P> " Of course the opponents of Mussolini 's regime are naturally making great capital of the tragedy . I am of the opinion , however , that the Premier will come through this affair stronger than ever , as the people of Italy recently have demonstrated that they are wholeheartedly behind him and his ideals . <P> " While it is true that at one time I was not a member of the Fascisti , I am now one of its most loyal members . It gives me great satisfaction to know that I shall soon be near my dear friend Mussolini , and I shall continue to give him what aid I can . "
