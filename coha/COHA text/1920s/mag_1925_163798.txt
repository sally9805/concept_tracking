The assembling of the 69th Congress saw four newcomers peeping into the Senate and looking around for their seats . All other Senators had occupied their seats , in the session of about two weeks held last March to confirm appointments and consent to treaties . The four newcomers are to fill the seats of senators who have died since last March . All are nominally Republican . <P> Newcomer No. 1 . Senator George H. Williams of Missouri was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Selden P. Spencer , Republican . <P> Newcomer No. 2 . Senator Arthur R. Robinson of Indiana was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Samuel M. Ralston , Democrat . Senator Robinson represents a gain of one vote by the Republicans . He was chosen because Governor Jackson of Indiana is a Republican . <P> Newcomer , No. 3 . Senator Robert M. LaFollette Jr . was elected to fill the vacancy caused by the death of his father . He is an insurgent succeeding an insurgent . <P> Newcomer No. 4 . Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacancy caused by the death of Edwin F. Ladd . Ladd was an insurgent , and Nye is probably to be listed as the same , since he is a leader of the Non-Partisan League although appointed nominally as a Republican . <P> In the case of Newcomers Nos. 1 and 2 , there is little to be said . They are presumably regular Republicans coming into the regular fold . But Nos. 3 and 4 are young men and insurgents , and around the appearance of each of them revolves a little scheming . <P> Young Senator LaFollette is no less an insurgent than his father . From babyhood upward he stood at his father 's side and learned the catechism of insurgency . Last year the late Senator LaFolette was read out of the Republican caucus and denied appointment to committees as a Republican . No such course was taken last week when the Republican caucus met . The young Senator was invited to be present . He did not attend , however . The reason for the change of front by the regulars was that they deem it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate comes up for reelection . They are senators who were elected in 1920 , a Republican landslide year . There is no prospect of electing Republican Senators in any states where Republicans were not elected in 1920 . Faced with the likelihood of losing several seats , the regular Republicans are anxious to preserve as many of their number as possible-and one of these is Senator Lenroot of Wisconsin . Lenroot is a regular and it is pretty well agreed that he can not be elected if young Bob opposes him . Hence the overtures to young Mr. LaFollette.
