txt Italy 's Aspirations . Before passing judgment as to whether or no Italy is reaching after a world empire , would it not be wiser . to wait until specific acts are done . This is not asking too much , , esPecialiy when one remembers that the judgment of American newspapers which Prophesied that Mussolini would last six months have been wrong In that he has already lasted six years . The writer knows that the majority of the American people do not believe Italy to be seething in a sea of unrest with an Imperial Rome as its objective . This Is easier to understand when one remembers that there is a simple reason for Italy seeking to find an outlet for her colonials . Our immigration law has forced her to seek elsewhere . a placa for her superfluous Population and in turning to Africa , for instance , these colonials go there , driven by the same motives which drove her colonials here , namely , the right to a chance to work for their bread and butter .
