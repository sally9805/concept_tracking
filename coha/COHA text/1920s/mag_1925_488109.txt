o NE BY ONE the miserable slanders and lies of the World War are being exposed . Now it is Brigadier General James E. Charteris , said to have been Chief of Intelligence of the British Army during the war , who at a dinner at the National Arts Club in New York City let the cat out of the bag in regard to the abominable story that the Germans were utilizing the bodies of their dead in order to obtain fats and other things needed for fertilizing and for the making of ammunition . From a dead German soldier General Charteris obtained a picture of some German dead being sent home and one of the cadavers of dead horses being returned from the front for fertilizing purposes . Knowing the Chinese ancestor-worship , General Charteris changed the caption under these pictures and sent them to a Shanghai newspaper , England being then eager to rouse Chinese sentiment against the Germans . He then forgot all about it , until six weeks later a letter from a Chinese reader of the Field , a British hunting publication , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " horrible boiling down of dead German soldiers . " T HE STORY SPREAD all over England , and this high-minded and gentlemanly general even went so far as to have a diary forged purporting to tell the feelings of a German soldier employed in the boiling-down factory when suddenly he found that he had to boil the body of his brother . This was so raw that even this hero did not dare use it , but it is now in a British war museum , doubtless as anauthenticated war document . Thus- does war make blackguards , slanderers , forgers , liars  --  in brief , scoundrels  --  of officers and gentlemen . General Charteris told this pretty anecdote to his hearers as " an amusing sidelight on the work of his office , " according to the New York Times . It seems even now that a man who would stoop to such statements ought to be expelled from the society of gentlemen and gentlewomen . Less disgusting but equally illuminating is the confession in a recent issue of the New Statesman , one of the foremost British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years since the war ended and we are still pretending that the Germans are an inferior and predatory , if not actually criminal , nation . Such pretenses served our purpose legitimately enough during the war , when we wanted to get the Americans into it , but in 1925 they are merely ridiculous . " This is the stuff that the great Ambassador Walter Hines Page and the American press fell for , by which the American people were fooled into entering the war . A DMIRAL SIMS on the witness stand is a joy forever . He has never been known to adjust his utterances to spare official feelings , and when he appeared in Washington before the air inquiry he lived up to his reputation . What could be more delicious than this ? Asked by Senator Bingham to comment on Secretary Wilbur 's statement that " my idea is that there is no such thing as control of the air as long as the enemy has one plane , " the Admiral replied : " I wonder who told him that . . . . The remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does not mean anything at all . " The Admiral declared Colonel Mitchell a " bully good fellow " who " has done an inestimable service in bringing this thing to the attention of the people . " His " scoring of the moss-backs in the Navy Department was merciless ; it demands a complete overhauling of the Department at the hands of Congress . As for the airplane , the admiral took the position that every battleship is at the mercy of fliers . Confirming our recent editorial , Twin Military Evils , he declared that all new weapons have been resisted by military and naval authorities throughout the ages , spoke of the opposition he had witnessed to taking the sails off battleships , to the torpedo and submarine and other new devices , and did not hesitate to refer to his own insubordination in Roosevelt 's day when he attacked the Navy Department for its delinquencies in the f matter of target practice . His testimony , however , was against such an independent air service as has been urged by Colonel Mitchell . Why Secretary Wilbur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelations is hard to understand .
