Every egg laid in Scotland after June 1 , 1929 , will be stamped with a national mark ( see p. 21 ) . Whether the mark shall read " Laid in Scotland " or " something more dignified " was weightily considered last week by His Majesty 's Secretary of State for Scotland , fussy Sir John Gilmour . <P> In the House of Commons an attempt to pull Sir John 's leg was made by another , more humorous , Scot , Austin Hopkinson , M. P. " Will not the Right Honorable Gentleman , " he suggested , " take it upon himself to order that all third class eggs shall be rubber stamped with the Scottish national motto : Nemo me impune lacessit ? " * <P> <P> *Generally translated by Scots " Wha daur meddle wi ' me ? " In literal English : ' ' No man attacks me with impunity. "
