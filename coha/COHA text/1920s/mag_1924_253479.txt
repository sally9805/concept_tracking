For 18-odd years the Dearborn Independent had been a small town weekly . In November , 1918 , Henry Ford published it with the resolve to apply to it his much-discussed ideas of quantity production . <P> The problem of securing circulation for the publication was attacked with Ford 's habitual energy . When he purchased it , its subscribers numbered only a few hundred . After some of his sensational views on various topics appeared , quite a number of readers bought it for a time out of mere curiosity . But the bulk of its subscriptions were obtained by Ford agents or employees on liberal commissions of from 30 to 50% . Many Ford plants subscribed to the weekly 100% . Yet its circulation has spread considerably beyond Mr. Ford 's own business following . There are 125,000 immediately employed by the Ford Motor Co. , and about as many more employees of Ford agencies . But the Dearborn Independent 's circulation is now stated to be 701,000 copies weekly . Evidently Mr. Ford has ambitions for his magazine . A new $1,400,000 building at Dearborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to turn out 1,000,000 copies of 68 pages each week . Yet , unlike most of Mr. Ford 's other ventures , the Dearborn Independent has not paid expenses , although this must be largely attributed to its policy of not accepting advertisements . <P> Undoubtedly Mr. Ford 's fondness for his paper is due to his ability to say in it just what he thinks about Jews , moneylenders , international bankers , currency , who started the War and why , and other favorite topics . As a subtitle , the weekly bears the slogan , " Chronicler of the Neglected Truth . "
