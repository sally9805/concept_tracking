Matthew Arnold On the Occasion of His Centenary OR a spirit of any delicacy and dignity , " says Arnold , writing of great names that have passed away , " what a fate , if he could foresee it I To be an oracle for one generation , and then of little or no account forever . " The fate on which he thus touches was not to be his own ; the sensitive care for truth , which was one with his own delicacy and dignity , preserved him from it . To a deliberate view he is greater now than he seemed to his contemporaries ; the content of his Writing appears , upon the whole , more substantial and permanent . The poetry indeed , the best of it , still leaves the same exquisite and haunting impression upon a few ; perhaps it will always be upon a few . It is the work in prose that takes to itself , the more we know it and see it in perspective , an added importance . His greatness in his prose is double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a critic of its literature ( both produced and inherited ) , its education , its politics , its religion , its social structure and its manners . He saw that the most brilliant thing a critic can possibly be is ? right . He has his limits , but there is a soundness that attends him even when he is signally incomplete . lie is , though not the greatest , nor the richest , nor spiritually the deepest , yet the most intellectual of the Victorian literary figures , Tennyson , Browning , Carlyle , Emerson , Ruskin , Dickens , ThackeraY and the rest ; for intellect is understanding and meets its truest test in the broadest , the most decisive facts of life . The growth of human insight is marked , each step of it , by a new distinction ; the felicity of his criticism is that in its exercise the distinctions he drew , the names by Which he marked them , the classifications thus created , are ( not only a few but many of them ) of last- ! rig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which his criticism can be carried 011 . And second , he was not satisfied with criticism , With just judgment , but made it the basis of a steady and sagacious effort toward amendment and a sound reconstruction . He " drove at prac- tf.ce. , , In particular , he saw , far in advance of his tinic - , and indeed of our time , the modern task , and set about to perform it ; the task of saving the itreasures of the old order while frankly and abso-lutely accepting the new ; the task of bringing theminto living union . He was in the profound sense a conservative liberal . Matthew Arnold lingers in the shadows of many a mind as a " superior person , " a fastidious critic , a delicately gloved literary exquisite who called us Philistines and gently reprehended us for our crudity and commonness . But in truth he is humane and he is inclusive ; there is nothing deeper in him than these instincts . He is inclusive : he is bent upon not overlooking any of the essentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the essence of his work that he is trying , in the words he used of Sophocles in the sonnet ? words that are perhaps too often quoted , but can not be too often understood ? to see life steadily and see it whole . He perceives the merit of apparent opposites and tries so to put them in their places that the opposition turns into mutual help . He is not for waste ; he will not wholly throw over what either the past or the enemy has to give . He is not only a conservative liberal but a Hebraical Hellenist , and he attempts to be a Christian rationalist . Again , he is humane : not only does he keep a steadfast hold on the rule that human intellect exists for human benefit but he will have the possessions of intellect itself , to the very utmost extent possible , a common possession of humanity . He is , in the words that Mrs. Robinson has used of a very different person , her brother Theodore Roosevelt , " a great sharer ; " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This , " he says , " is the social idea ; and the men of culture are the true apostles of equality . The great men of culture are those who have had a passion for diffusing , for making prevail , for carrying from one end of society to the other , the best knowledge , the best ideas of their time ; who have labored to divest knowledge of all that was harsh , uncouth , difficult , abstract , professional , exclusive , to humanise it , to make it effective outside the clique of the cultivated and learned , yet still remaining the best knowledge and thought of the time . . . . Such a man was Abelard in the Middle Ages , in spite of all his imperfections .. . . Such were Lessing and Herder in Germany , at the end of the last century ; and their services to Germany were in this way inestimably precious . . ? And why ? Because they humanized knowledge ; because they broadened the basis of life and intelligence , because they worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God prevail . " Such a man , in his measure , was Arnold himself , and the full fruit of his labors is yet to be seen . To throw open every subject whatever to reason and humanity and to make them prevail and govern there ( only making most cautiously sure that our light is not darkness ) , that was his constant aim . A hasty American economist and reformer has called him " a conservative literary man . " A literary man in England who protests that we are seeing " a lower class brutalized " and " an upper class materialized , " who pronounces for the equality of all as the true basis for a healthy civilization , who would see the British aristocracy , that " splendid piece of materialism , " gradually dissolved , their great estates broken up , and laws limiting the amount of land or money that can be inherited , an Englishman who while favoring the notion of the establishment of religion would establish all of the large religious communions equally with the Anglican , who is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social matters and that the nation in its collective and corporative character , as the state , can do so much more for civilization than now by carrying this truth into effect , is hardly a Tory . On the side of spirit and tone of life Arnold takes it as his own function to deal chiefly with the civilization of the middle class , but is entirely aware of the great problems that surround such a matter . It is his interest in " the social idea , " it is the instinctive need to share , that explains the simplicity of Arnold 's style . He wishes to stand beside the reader and thus see the object " eye to eye " with him . If a certain fineness of vision is required he still has the faith that this is a latent possession of humanity and may be evoked ; let us in any case evoke it wherever possible . " By our best self we are united , impersonal , at harmony . " One of the cleverest of contemporary minds sees in these writings " thin-spun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tracts for the times . " Well , he certainly intended them to be thin-spun in the only sense in which they are so . His supply of thought is not thin . As Mr. Brownell in an admirable essay has pointed out it is because in the interest of clarity Arnold resolutely takes but one thing at a time that we are tempted rashly to conclude that he has only a slender sheaf of ideas at his disposal . He is fertile of ideas . But he could not tolerate a dense and crowded growth of them in the same page or essay . He has a singular art of clearing out the under-growth and permitting the tall and commanding thoughts to stand forth . The independent intelligence that he brings to bear tells him that " the easy writing that makes hard reading " is an almost universal fault in literature , that a true and important idea deserves an open approach , that it is only the fewest in our language who do justice to their own conceptions in the minds of others . Arnold is taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sets the critic is " a disinterested endeavor to learn and propagate the best , " etc . " Propaganda , " writes Mr. Santayana in his beau . ' tiful Soliloquies in England , " propaganda , that insult to human nature . " If it is so , education'must be an insult to human nature and I sometimes no tice a tendency in the young to resent it as such . The Sermon on the Mount was no doubt a terri ble reflection on existing human nature , but hard " ly because it was propaganda . We do not insult people by assuming that they are willing to learn or capable of learning . We do them . honor . To be sure , pettish human nature is impatient of learning and of the supposition that arlY knowledge could profitably be added to it , but that is simply the most pitiful and hidefensible of our weaknesses . Nothing gives the measure of the difference between Arnold and Mr. Santayana , of the want in the latter of a certain fundamental human seriousness ? seriousness in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his acute and large-minded spectatorshiP can almost but not quite make us forget , better than the quoted words . The reach , the greatness and beauty of Mr. Santayana 's thought are not enough appreciated ; if this trait were added they might be of the highest order . The instinctive need to share is at the root of Arnold 's view of criticism also . It is the business of criticism , he tells us , " to see the object as in itself it really is . " Now clearly it is the business of criticism , for Arnold and for everybody , as the word implies , to judge , to pronounce good or bad . And at this saying of his both the common mina ' with its maxim , that there is no disputing about tastes , and the philosophic mind , with its remark that good and bad are not in the object but in the beholder 's impression of the object ? that " there 9 nothing either good or had but thinking that is ' feeling makes it so " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder . The truth is that Arnold is purposely oblivious of the philosophic subtlety ; and the popular ' notion that there is no truth or standard in the subject of taste ' that it is abandoned to individual caprice , is P what he is set upon correcting . He speaks as if good and bad were objective , meaning in effect that the sense of therm is shared , common , social , reliable . The duty of the critic is " to get himself out of the Way and let humanity judge . " There is such a thing as the normal human impression . The economy of human life makes a certain impression helpful , and human nature is normal when it responds with this appropriate impression and no other . It can not be said that from a man 's arbitrary taste there is no appeal . There is an appeal , not to the majority , but to the normal , which means in the end an appeal to the type of taste most fruitful of human happiness or most consistent with it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he finds to be " the function of criticism at the present time . " It is the function of Purifying the wells from which creative literature is drawn . One thinks of the critic as judging the Work after it appears ; Arnold thinks of him also as gradually imparting his standard to the creative mind . Then in the struggle for existence between the various tentative imaginations that sPontaneously spring up in that mind some will be Promptly suppressed by the critical conditions that now reign there and only the fitter will survive . Criticism has thus the mission of raising the very starting-point of creation to a higher level , of cleansing the very atmosphere that the creative spirit breathes . The social function of criticism is the creation of taste , and of an instinctive wis-dom ? As a critical leader Arnold with all his merits has two great inadequacies . The first is that he regards it as the office of creative literature itself to be in effect " a criticism of life ; " to exhibit the things of life , that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief . Thus he ranges himself with those who hold it the business of literature to educate and form us for better living . How easy it is to turn in at this door and not see the larger one ! True , literature often has a power to form us ; let all use be made of that power . But literature has another reason for existence , ' lamely , to be life instead of preparing for it ; to be a high and satisfying experience , a worthy use of timeand an end and not a means , a form of thaPPiness . " Art for art 's sake , " that is for ueatirY 's sake , must have its place . To take this Wider view would not a little have modified some of his judgments . The other weakness has been besides a bad exartiPle . There must be in literature in any case an element of the criticism or estimate of the things 1 ) 1 life . The critic can not avoid pronouncing on questions of fact , of truth , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste but reason . Taste is an immediate verdict and Arnold , impatient of logical machinery , is too often tempted in large questions of truth to make his reason dispense with reasoning and issue an immediate verdict too , a prompt and easy " intuition . " He will be a seer with the naked eye . This may be called the fallacy of the critic . The critic can not always tell us with assurance what in life and literature does actually make for human happiness without taking a great deal of pains to find out . Through a cautious logic , through experiment and other tests , we escape from the plausibilities of our own minds , we make sure " that our light is not darkness . " We do but follow Arnold 's spirit further . He himself is too prone to forget his own lines and stop short of " the dragon-wardered fountains where the springs of knowledge are . " Some of the examples of this Mr. Stuart Sherman in his invaluable guide to Arnold , has analyzed . His sensitive care for truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new world that is now " powerless to be born " awaits the development of intellectual conscience as the one absolute condition and means of arising . Akin to this is his one defect as a moralist , a defect that is typically Victorian . He lays it down that in morals the knowing is easy and it is only the doing that is hard . True within the field of established morality but quite forgetful of the morality that has yet to be established . We have a railway that as yet takes us but a part of the distance to our destination ; at the end of it we must get off and make our way through the bush as best we can . He reminds us impressively that the fortunes of society depend upon morals , but not enough that it is the business of morals effectually to secure the well-being of society . On religion , inspired by Spinoza 's Theological Political Treatise and by Vinet , Arnold did some of his most momentous work . His early phase is one of scepticism and of sadness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is chiefly in verse . When he becomes a traveling inspector of schools , begins a long career full of work and tedium , meets the members of school boards and is a guest at middle-class tables , when in brief he comes close to English life , we see a new phase . Immersed in work and facing the defects that most repel him he becomes constructive and puts sadness away . Life gradually wrote out the equation : Critical and fastidious instincts plus deep humanity equal reform . This mood of statesmanship he carries into religion . He asks himself what are the elements of Christianity that no modern knowledge can shake , that rest verifiably upon experience , that the scientific sceptic himself must accept . The inadequacy of Arnold 's answer must not blind us to the fact that no more fruitful and sagacious question has ever been asked . One after another he takes the conceptions of Christian faith and translates them into the language of human experience and salutary consequence . The points of view of science and of biblical research he supplements with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequately take is the point of view of religion itself . He is moralistic , not sufficiently spiritual . There are sides of religious experience lighting up the whole problem of which he knows too little . He can even write of the idea that God is personal , " a being who thinks and loves , " that the stress upon it is due to the Aryan love of metaphysics , not to Hebrew religion at all , that it has no deep value for human life . Still , his statement of the question of religion for our time , his setting of the conditions for the answer , are work of a statesmanlike courage and grasp that have not been sufficiently acknowledged . The truth is that because Arnold wrote on the most deep-reaching problems with a sustained simplicity of language and of touch academic scholars have at no time fully perceived his power as a philosopher .
