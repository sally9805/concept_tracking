txt Water Shortage at Bear Mountain . Last week Thursday , the record hot day of the Summer , while driving through Rear Mountain Park , ) stopped to endeavor to fill a thernms bottle with water . The place was crowded with sweltering people . To my astonishment provision for drinking water appeared to be so inadequate as to seem , on such a day , almost criminal . I was sent from one pavilion to another until I had visited four . I inquired of attendants In uniform and of those in charge ? ot various concessions , and all referred me to a place at a considerable distance . After walking from one-third to one-half mile 1 came to a hand pump . under a small sheltering roof , where a seething mass of people were trampling on each other , and on the muddy ground around the pump , elbowing and pushing and struggling to get to the water . Little children and young girls were in the jam . I appeal to you to publish this statement , hoping it may possibly reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase the sale of bottled &Inas,; that Is contemptible In a place supposed to be run as a State or interstate reservation , or public park . There may be some explanation not apparent on the surface of things , but assuredly an intelligent , sincere effort could relieve such a situation . G. ROWLAND MUNROE .
