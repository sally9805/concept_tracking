Lately Germany announced that it could make silk for a lady 's stocking out of the lobster shells left from her supper party ( TIME , Dec. 6 ) . Last week Engineer Kurt Gerson of Berlin went further . He said he could make silk purses out of sows ' ears , boars ' ankles , " potato peelings , toothpicks and all manner of garbage .
