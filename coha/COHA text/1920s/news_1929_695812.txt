txt A stiff wind is blowing off the Barrier today  --  a wind that lashes the surface snow into a cloud , that cuts the face and nips the hands and feet . Into it a line of sledges just began o bore their way toward the base , the men tugging at the gee poles and calling to their dogs , the frost from their breath gathering on their unpaved faces and the sides of their fur caps under their parka hoods . They are building an epic of polar sledging , doggedly fighting their way eight miles Inland and back twice a day , carrying loads that had been thought impossible . They began on Dec. 31 and in the seventeen sledging days since then they have moved more than a hundred tons of materials to the base over the drifting and buckling bay ice . On two days , during a blizzard , the work had to be stopped , but , although conditions are severe today , they are plugging ahead , making two trips , carrying prosaic and undramatic coal sacks , traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Day-End . They have not lost a dog or a parcel , although time and again sleds with loads with more than 1,000 pounds have tipped over or slid into slush holes between pressure ridges . It is difficult to know which to admire the most , the men or the dogs , for both are thoroughly tired at the end of the day . The men , who fight sliding sledges and toppling loads when the trail is rough or along a knife edge of pressure ice , are able to ride back to the ship from the base , but the dogs trot the entire thirty-two . miles , tugging unfailingly at their harness , grabbing a mouthful of snow as they go , and occasionally turning aside to find a little recreation in trying to pick a fight with a passing rival team . Norse Tribute to Americans . No men are more appreciative of such work than the Norwegians , who have done so much to develop polar travel , and they have been frankly amazed at the progress achieved . One of them , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sverdrup and Amundsen , one who had lived all his life in the Arctic and is driving one of the most successful of the dog teams , was expressing his enthusiasm last night . And lest it be thought that too much is being Calmed for an American expedition , it might be best to let him tell what he thinks of it . " Every time I go round that point up there and see all those things piled up , I am wondering , " he said , slamming down a huge fist . " All that stuff  --  eight miles across the ice and those pressure ridges ! Never has there been anything like it and nobody could do it but Americans . They go , go , all the time they go ! " Spirit Imbued in Men by Byrd . To one who saw Commander Byrd unloading his plane in the face of almost insuperable difficulties at Spitsbergen before he made the North Pole flight , there is much in the present situation to afford a striking parallel and to show the spirit with which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of floating ice and the Norwegians living there doubted that pontoons rould be safely forced through such large and dangerously pressing cakes of ice . However , he did it with the aid of men who worked day and night . Down here the bay ice is so far out that at first it seemed an obstacle that might for a time hold up the expedition . Big Cache Already Amassed . When Captain Roald Amundsen arrived here he was able to take his ship in beyond our present base and within two and a half miles of Frainhelm , his base . Only a few days after the anniversary of Captain Amundsen 's arrival here Jan. 14 the Byrd expedition has put more han . 180 tons ashore and the ice , although shifting , has not yet shown any signs of going out . It is difficult to make any comparisons as to loads because the sleds have traveled light for half the thirty-two miles covered every day and the number of dogs in a team has varied considerably . - ISowever , the loads have run from 700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton on occasions with a nine-dog team . Heavy Loads Pulled at a Trot . Yesterday one team of nine dogs made the usual . trips and carried a ton and three-quarters . And although these loads may be said to have been carried over the same trail , it is a trail which has shifted near the base constantly , as huge pressure ridges have been forced up and detours have been made necessary . There have been many loads of 1,200 to 1,500 pounds hauled by ninedog teams at a good trotting pace the whole distance of eight miles . Sverdrup found that six dogs easily hauled 650 to 800 pounds and averaged twenty miles a day for many days , and Sir Ernest Shackleton learned that fourteen dogs would haul one ton . It is also worthy of consideration that Commander Byrd 's dogs have not been worked too severely and that at the present time seventyeight of the eighty-seven dogs are in harness . Occasionally one is taken out for a rest or because it has been injured in a fight and replaced by another , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group has been at work . Yesterday the record was made of I eight tons hauled to the base . This achievement has been the more remarkable because everything else has gone on at the same time . ' rwo houses have been erected at the base , material has been checked and stacked , the airplane has been assembled and flown , radio work both in connection with the base and the plane has gone ahead and Commander Byrd has been enabled to do a tremendous amount of correspondence , plan rations for journeys , correct compasses and do some preliminary navigational work . All this has been a cause of intense gratification to Commander Byrd and the other members of his expedition because it has been proved that the preparations were properly carried out and that the various divisions of the expedition are able to function as had been planned . This feeling arises from a full knowledge of the difficulty of proper preparation and the risks which accompany any deficiency . Amundsen forgot snow shovels . Some things have been forgotten on this expedition . but nothing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be replaced by some expert workman . Expeditions are won by preparation and the dogs are a good example of this . If dependence had been placed on Amundsen 's success in getting inland so far by the middle of January and sufficient dogs had not been brought to do the heavy freight sledging , the work of the expedition would have been stopped and its success jeopardized . The commander of a polar expedition stakes everything on his preparation . In this case Commander Byrd is risking his entire career , his reputation not only as an explorer t alsoas navigator , and his ? tune in one of ' the most hazardous undertakings ever attempted in Antarctica . ? There has been time after time when success might have been jeopardized by a mishap . There was the long tow down to the pack ice from New Zealand , which , if not undertaken , might not have enabled us to reach the whaler Larsen in time to be towed through . This saved us coal so that a full supply for every purpose seems now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whalers report the pack ice the heaviest they have ever known at this time of year , and it is certain that the City of New York could not have been reached here for some time if the pack had been bucked without assistance . There was danger to the Eleanor Bolling , a steel ship , . in pushing ahead through the ice-filled waters in the fog , and danger to her from the pack which caused the delay in her recent sailing from New Zealand . There were also navigational difficulties in a region full of erratic magnetic phenomena , difficulties overcome by the use of many aids , including the radio . And then came this present phase of freighting across the ice , made possible only by the preparations and the loyalty of a diversified crew . Then there are risks to the personnel on which so much depends . Dog drivers , for instance , never leave either the ship or the base without being reported by radio to the other end of the trail and a constant lookout is maintained . The - watch is kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of men who leave with eadh party , their load , the number of dogs and every item of information about them , all this is constantly recorded so that it would be impossible for a team to go astray without being reported in a short time . Any of these things going wrong might spell disaster . if not to the expedition , at least to the leader of it . Commander Byrd has built up a reputation as a navigator of aircraft , in$- , he is now flying in a region where such a reputation might easily be ruined by an improper understanding of the difficulties of the situation or failure to meet them as adequately as possible . On his short exploration flight the other day , it was found . that not a compass on the plane worked because of the proximity of the magnetic pole . It is . believed that this difficulty may be overcome . He must also in all flights , except the one to the pole , cut across meridians and lines of compass variation and this makes the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inductor corn-I pass  --  much more difficult . What it would mean to be without sight because of an overcast sky and unreliable compasses when flying over this country at a speed of 90 miles an hour may be imagined . In a very short time one might penetrate to a distance where rescue might be impossible , where it would be too far to walk back . These navigational problems have been uppermost . in Commander Byrd 's mind for many months , even with all the other details of the expedition crowding his mind , and upon his solution of them depends ' to a. large degree his success . Getting Attached to the Antarctic . One dwells on this subject of preparation because it is not possible until one has been here to realize what explorers mean when they talk about it . Home and all the things which a man may call to his aid in civilized communities are a long way off . This country grows on one despite its loneliness , or perhaps because of it . After an airplane flight to the base it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a dog team over the winding trail , past pressure ridges and over small cracks through which the seals make inquisitive noises . The bay ice then seems a. great plain , varied only in its contours , silent , rigid and beau- , tiful . Sverre Strom , who loves the ice and has seen all the - myriad colors of the polar ice , who has experienced this terrible silence and menace , took me with him , and when we were coming back , riding behind the softly padding dogs , he turned around and said : " Sometimes I stop here all alone and you can hear your heart . " Not the sound of your heart , Strom meant , but your heart itself speaking strange things , uplifted perhaps , all by the limitless white . All Colors Born of Pure White . There is nothing more purely white than the light here reflected from the snow . All the changes in color , the softly glowing shadows of the barrier cliffs , the shadows with just a hint of rose in them , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as one rides along the frail or trots behind the dog team , the stirIface gleams with gems , points of fire reflected from the perfect crystals of the snow . They look like opals glowing with changing and marvelous color . No larger and no longer snow crystals have ever been seen than down here , made of almost pure water vapor , and the color comes from the cumulative effect of the prisms in these manylarge crystals . The effect is almost startling - when first seen . for it is something unknown except in polar regions where the air is pure . The dogs trot along with their load at even dog trot , the runners sweeping over the dry surface , and not another sound except the calls of the driver to his leader or the snap of the whip over their hides . Our legs get tired after a time and , ' as the load is only a little more than I half a ton , we jump aboard to ride a short distance . ? Far ahead is another dog team , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with safety . On either side the plain of white stretches to the cliffs of the barrier , those cliffs which seemed so low from the airplane but which become more imposing as they are apprpached more closely . But we never go within more than a hundred yards of them .
