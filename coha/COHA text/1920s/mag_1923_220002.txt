Papin <P> The Life of Christ , by Giovanni Papini , was published in Italy in the second year of " the peace " - 1921 . It rapidly ran through six large editions . The sixth edition is an English translation recently published. - In 1911 Papini shocked even the ultra radical thinkers of Europe by his The Memoirs of God , a book of such extreme atheism that it was considered the last word in blasphemy . The author was the son of an atheist and confessed that he had an extreme dislike for the church from earliest childhood . His mother had him baptized secretly . He became one of the leading literary men of Italy because of his brilliant attacks on even such philosophical systems as Haeckel or Nietzsche could construct . He was known as an atheist , an anarchist , a nihilist . Then financial troubles drove him to leave his native Florence and live within the confines of a poor little mountain village . Here he became acquainted with the lowly , the humble and those that labor and are heavy laden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these and the help of a few modern books as his only sources he wrote his Life of Christ . Papini 's aim is " a book specially written for those who are outside the Church of Christ ; the others , those who have remained within , united to the heirs of the apostles , do not need my words . " He declares his absolute acceptance of all four gospels as authentic and of equal value , despising the words and theology of the higher criticism . He wishes to write of the Christ whom he sees in the gospels , without let or hindrance . His style is somewhat wordy , but of unsurpassed brilliance in some parts , as , for example , where he describes the utter lowliness of the manger . Another characteristic of the book is its succession of keen historical settings . In three short pages he traces the history of Israel from the days of the slavery in Egypt to the later slavery under Rome . And he does it with such vividness that the reader really lives in the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others have written the life of Christ . Renan 's opening sentence is : " Jesus , the son of Joseph and Mary , was born in Nazareth . " In some theological seminaries it is almost an aphorism that every man must write his own life of Christ . Papini lived a life apart from Christ for many years . His interpretation is thus all the more fresh and appealing , and will have a tremendous effect on all men who , like him , have lived , doubting , in an unChristlike generation . Many men , both inside and outside the church , will see in this book of the ex-atheist a living gospel , wrought out of a fiery experience . <P> - The Life of Christ-Giovanni Papini- Horcourt ( $3.50 ) .
