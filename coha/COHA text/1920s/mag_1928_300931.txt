Mr. Moneypenny . Perhaps it was the purpose of this play that , after seeing it , one should go out among the trees , drink buttermilk , nibble roots and herbs , renounce money as " the root of all evil " ( a line in the play ) . This purpose was not accomplished . Author Channing Pollock , a great showman , is not a great artist . He has tried to do a Faust , with snatches of The Adding Machine and the Ballet Mechanique . His devil is a silk-hatted Babbitt named Mr. Moneypenny , who seizes an old and whining clerk named John Jones , gives him ticker tape and a Park Avenue apartment . It soon becomes apparent that John Jones is not happy-one doubts that he could be happy under any conditions . His children ( with one exception ) go to various types of metropolitan hell . Meanwhile , Author Pollock denounces night clubs , politicians , newspaper owners , Algonquinesque writers , Wall Street , society . It is all very bitter ; but there is action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staccato staging by Richard Boleslavsky . These first two acts are the outstanding curiosity of the current Manhattan season . The third act is a tedious sermon showing that happiness is just around the corner for those who renounce gold &; greed . Author Pollock calls the whole thing a " verbal cartoon . " <P> <P> The Common Sin , variously known as Bobo 's Bargain , Bad Debts and Paid Off , came out of the shop , stumbled through a quadrangle of illicit love , polished off a polite off-stage murder , ended sweetly . Its author , Willard Mack , also wrote the current and noisy Gang War . <P> <P> The K Guy , so called because in his forgeries he always chose a name containing the letter K , ended up in Hollywood with a contract in the movies . Nobody seemed to know who he was and all through the play suspicion veered among the occupants of a Hollywood lunchroom . When suspicion was not veering , gags appeared ; these were somewhat amusing and so was The K Guy . <P> <P> Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that Will Rogers is not funny . There were moments in Three Cheers when he was being a little too much of a big brother to Dorothy Stone , for whose father , Fred , he had been persuaded to substitute ; and there were other moments when he was too self-consciously ingenuous and stammering . Yet , as usual , his gags were good : <P> " Al Smith 's bein ' a Catholic ai n't goin ' to hurt him none . What 's goin ' to hurt him is his being a Democrat . " <P> ' ' If the Democrats had as much money as the Republicans , they would stop trying to elect a president , divide it up into shares , and celebrate . " <P> Also there was a song which Will Rogers sang together with Andy Tombes . La-de-da was the refrain of the song and its name was the Lard Song ; in the course of it , Andy Tombes interrupted his singing to ask Will Rogers whether he had heard about the Scotchman who went to the whippet races . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet on the hare . " <P> Aside from Will Rogers , the best thing in Three Cheers is Patsy Kelly , who fixes her beady and inspired eyes upon a comedian and sings " You 're Beautiful . " in a scratchy voice . Dorothy Stone dances nicely , but without the partnership of her father her talent even in this direction seems less than bewildering ; as yet she has too little ability to be a star . <P>
