txt Frank L. Smith spent $253,547 to win the Illinois Republican Senatorial nomination in April , or about $58,500 more than the outlay which caused Truman H. Newberry of Michigan to lose his seat in the Senate , according to testimony today before the Senate committee investigating campaign expenditures , which opened its inquiry into the recent contest at the polls in this State . Getting away to a flying start , the two members of the committee now here , Senator Reed , Chairman , and Senator La Follette , placed five prominent figures in Illinois politics on the stand  --  Colonel Smith , George E. Brennan , Democratic National Committeeman and Senatorial nominee ; Samuel Insull , the traction man ; Allen F. Moore , campaign manager for Colonel Smith , and Chester A. Willoughby , Senator 's secretary and manager of his Chicago headquarters . Sitting for five hours , the committee laid the groundwork for a wide investigation . Mr. Brennan , the testimony showed , had the modest expenditure of $20,811 , with contributions of $15,000 , leaving a shortage of $2,841 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown in connection with the finance hat the Senatat , gave his cam ittrei which Me . Willoughby s cago . Mr. Willoughby , however , said to the press tonight the Senator 's total campaign expenses were about $260,000 . Describing himself as a " utility exec ' and a farmer , " Mr. Insull admitted that he furnished the chief ammunition for the Smith fight when he con ' tributed $125,000 in three lumps . He was so deeply sympathetic with the opposition of Mr. Smith to the World Court that he gave an additional $33 , - 734 to propagandize foreigners and negroes against the Court . Mr. Irrull also gave George Brennan $15,000 for the Democratic campaign , even though the traction man is a Republican and backed Smith enthusiastically . lYloore Withheld Some Names . Besides the $125,000 gift of Mr. Insull , Allen F. Moore , campaign manager for Colonel Smith , gave $75,000 , and Colonel Smith himself $5,000 , these sums , with $40,000 to $50,000 from other persons , making up the campaign expenses . Who these contributors of the $40,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refusing to reveal the contents of a private memorandum book which he kept in a cipher code . The committee will decide tomorrow whether Mr. Moore must reveal the secrets of this " little memorandum book , " the contents of which he regards as confidential , he said In a quiet but determined fashion . It will decide , too , if Mr. Insult must tell whether he gave money to the CroweBarrett organization in Chicago , only to find later that this combination was supporting Senator against his candidate , Colonel Smith . Seemingly , Mr. Insull did give money to the Crowe-Barrett coalition . In fact , when asked about it by Senator Reed , he said smilingly : " You can draw your own conclusions . " Both Mr. Moore and Mr. Instill are to consult their counsel before replying , and it was evident that the firstnamed doubted the powers of the committee to force him to give up ; his , campaign secrets . Mr. Willoughby came prepared to testify for Senator , who is convalescing in Washington after a serious illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks , which Senator Reed was dissecting and examining when the hearing stopped late this afternopn . The most Interesting thing Mr. Willoughby said was that he gave Louis Behan , a Chicago politician , $17,000 to use for watchers at the polls . To his ' surprise , Mr. Smith ran into a snag when on the stand he attempted to denounce the speech by Senator Caraway on the Illinois political situ- ation . Demanding that his accuser be brought ' before him , Mr. Smith said Mr. Caraway had " used the terminology and tactics of a practiced scandalmonger . " " Stop , " warned Senator Reed , " you can not use this hearing as a forum to attack Senators or private individuals . You can make a speech outside if you want . " ? Later , Senator Reed permitted Colonel Smith to file for examination the prepares statement from which he read the Words just quoted . In it he also denied any wrong doing in the campaign . Colonel Smith , the first witness of the day , dneied he had ever received proffers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said the witness , knew far more about the financial details of his campaign than He did . He had expected his campaign to cost about 5150,000 , he stated , and added that he was much surprised when Mr. Insult gave him as large a contribution as 5125,000 . Outside of his attempt to attack Senator Caraway , a great deal of what the committee vainly tried to find out from him was later told by Mr. Moore . Moore Kept No Campaign Books . Colonel Smith used the morning part of the hearing , Mr. Moore taking the stand in afternoon . Senator Reed , facing Mr. Moore across the table , puffed on a cigar which he had gained permission to smoke in the court room of ' the Federal Building where the sessions are held . It was necessary to ask the Federal Judge for this privilege and when he granted it over the telephone , the atmosphere was soon blue and hazy . Mr. Moore bit his cigar and thought carefully over each answer he made . He kept no books on the Smith campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own private bank account " How did you distinguish the campaign money from your own ? " asked Senator Reed . " Oh , 1 kept a mental account . " All the money came in voluntarily , he told the committee , and he wrote no letters to ask for money , he stated . Senator Reed prodded Mr. Moore time and again for facts about the contributions , the witness almost invariably hesitating before answering . After forty-five minutes of this verbal fencing Mr. Moore said he regarded the contributions as confidential . " There 's nothing confidential when it comes to electing a man to public I office , " snapped Senator Reed . " When a man runs for the Senate the course he travels is public . That 's the view of the Senate and of this committee and we might as well settle ? that right now . " When Senator Reed inquired why there was embarrassment about telling who the contributors of the $40,000 to $50,000 were , Mr. Moore said some donors preferred to remain unknown , and that he considered the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " More than I care for Mrs. Moore to see in the newspapers , " the witness replied , admitting that it was about 575,000 . Senator Reed told Mr. Moore to consult wtih Mr. Smith and see if the Senatorial nominee " cared to take the responsibility of keeping the names secret . Insull Tells of Other Gifts . Following Mr. Moore on the stand , Mr. Insull , a short man with gray hair and gold-rimmed glasses , said at once : " I gave some more money than the $125,000 . It was in connection with the This added contribution he described as 526,904 for a campaign against the World Court among foreign language groups , $2,330 for newspaper advertising in foreign languages newspapers in the same cause , and $4,500 for similar I work , chiefly among the negro population . " That anti-World Court propaganda helped Mr. Smith , " suggested Mr. Reed . " Yes , but I would have spent the same for any candidate against the court , " Mr. Iseult replied . " I gave $15,000 to my friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " And , I am ashamed it was n't more , " he added . Mr. Brennan was on the stand just fifteen minutes . He said the total contributions to his campaign were the $15,000 from Mr. Insull and two other gifts of $2,500 and $500 from friends . " Mr. Insull , " hp said , " called me up . and I went over he said : ' Old fellow , do n't you want . to see me before I go to Europe tomorrow ? I want to give something to you even though I am a Republican . ' He and I are old friends ! ' " I have been in politics forty-two years and I have a great many friends and some enemies , " the jovial Democratic leader said , as he left the stand . Mr. Willoughby told the committee than Henry I. Green handled all the money in the Illinois campaign , and Mr. Green will be called later by the committee . As manager for Cook and some nineteen other counties in Illinois , Mr. Willoughby said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the counties themselves raised nothing for the campaign . He used $21,000 In the checking account which Senator Reed was examining into when the hearing recessed until tomorrow morning .
