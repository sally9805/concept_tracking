Samuel Marinus Zwemer is a big-boned , crude-featured , Dutch-descended son of Michigan . He has been called the most daring , resourceful and successful Christian Missionary to the Moslem world . When the issue is Cross against Crescent he is proud to stick at nothing . Therefore it was but characteristic that Dr. Zwemer should have been caught red handed at Cairo , last week , in the act of proselytizing students at the Mohammedan University of El-Azhar . <P> Under pretext of conducting a group of U. S. clergymen through the University , last week , strapping Missionary Zwemer began to distribute Presbyterian tracts . Soon some hundreds of the students became excited by this apparently inflammatory literature . One unshakably Moslem student sought to tear the last of the tracts from Dr. Zwemer 's potent fist , but other students barkened for a time to his loud , impressive words . <P> Next day Professor Sheik Kankalouni of the University of El-Azhar , wrote passionately to an Arabic newspaper in Cairo : " The tracts of Zwemer have caused such unrest among our students that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter might have had most serious results . " A like view was taken by the Ministry of Pious Foundations which demanded that officials of the U. S. Legation at Cairo should confiscate from Dr. Zwemer a permit which he has been granted to enable him to visit mosques . Pugnacious Dr. Zwemer stated that he would not give up the permit . <P> The Arabic press , frenzied by the incident , indulged in a Christian-scare , declaring that the Sudan is now a hotbed of Christian proselytizing , and that if the process continues it will dangerously further the seizure of this territory by Great Britain .
