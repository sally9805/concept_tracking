txt LAW OF NATIONS STANDS . To the Editor of The New York Times : Few details of reported speeches in the French Chamber or the British Parliament reach the American public . The following extract from the speech of M. Aristide Briand , March 16 , 1921 , is of paramount interest in reference to the sanctions accorded the laws of nations under the Versailles Treaty . He stated : " Certain sanctions of a particular character * * ? are prescribed by the treaty . But above and beyond these sanctions of the treaty there remain the sanctions of common law , all the sanctions of the laws of nations , all those which , in all epochs , have been recognized by the nations , and ever practiced by them . At the moment even of the treaty 's signature , at the moment when it was about to enter into force , the Allies very particularly addressed to M. von Lersner , President of the German delegation , a letter in which they stated , most categorically : ' It is understood that outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of nations , of the common law , and that we will have recourse to . ' " ( See Journal de Clunet , 1921 , Vol. 48 , Page 113 . ) The importance of this statement is enhanced when the treaty is scrutinized for rules which constitute new and progressive understandings of the law of nations or others derogating materially from its accepted principles . The test here , so far as America is concerned , rests in those rules of the general maintenance law and law of nations , approved and adopted by the Federal Constitution . " It is a subject , " says Jay , with tremendous foresight , " that merits attention and inquiry , and it is much to be wished that it may be more generally studied and ' understood . " ( Corresp. to Public Papers . Charge to Grand Jury , May 22 , 1793 . ) This speech of M. Briand 's throws a new light upon the Treaty of Versailles . It brings to the compact the obligation of the general common law . in casibus omissis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions whose nature would be most enlightening . J. WHITLA STINSON . New York , June 24 , 1921.
