Lcud Speaker . The New Play-wrights-John Dos Passos , John Howard Lawson , Francis Faragoh. , Michael Gold , Em Jo Basshe-impatient with the restraint of conventional theatre , have set up one of their own , bolstered up by the generous purse of Otto Hermann Kahn . Here , at old Bim 's , now the 52nd Street Theatre , they propose to experiment with those radical dramatic forms of whose marketability the commercial producers are suspicious . <P> Their first production , Loud Speaker , was written by John Howard Lawson , author of Processional ( TIME , Jan. 26 , 1925 ) . As expected , it is staged against a " constructivist " background and presents the subjective state of the principal characters as well as their objective actions . The virtue of such staging is that , by affording the playwright several planes of action on one stage , it allows greater flexibility than is permitted by the rigid three-walled limitations of ordinary theatre . Thus , in Loud Speaker , the candidate for governor of the State may be discovered mulling over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his memory of an Atlantic City bathing beauty may be enacted in another corner . His daughter may black-bottom on an upper level and his wife receive a weird , bearded , hypnotic lover on still another . By proper punctuation and emphasis , such a production may be made colorful , clear , rapid , nervous , like jazz music . But , though the new playwrights deserve credit for the enterprise , Mr. Lawson 's " farce " fails to enthrall the observer , because : 1 ) The lines are not pointed artfully enough to evoke laughs in the right places . 2 ) His characters are not sufficiently personalized . No one cares whether the candidate for Governor does get drunk and say the wrong things over the radio , thus confounding the tabloids and winning the election by unorthodox strategy . <P> Money From Home . On the road it was known as Coal Oil Jenny . Though occasionally it spurts a hopeful wisecrack , the full gusher of real drama is not forthcoming , wherefore it will probably not strike money from Broadway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , masters gullible wealthy women for profit . One victim is a Pennsylvania factory girl , come to Manhattan to spend her $6,000 for a furtive smack of city life . The exploiter of women , duped by her reckless display , rushes into matrimony only to find he has caught a liability instead of an asset . And here is the end of the second act , with the playwright-actor of his own U. S. comedy still unworthy in the sight of the audience . How to reveal a heart of gold in the bad man ? A powder mill explodes . Heroic qualities erupt . With nobility thus suddenly emergent , the ending triumphs happily for all , including the audience .
