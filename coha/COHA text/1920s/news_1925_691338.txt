txt Ur . PRITCHETT Of the Carnegie 1Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching . commenting upon the re'Port of an educational finance inquiry made by a private commission . . ea.ys that its volumes , so far published , " proceed upon the assumption that " the quality of our education is now " satisfactory " and that the only wayi of improving our present program of education is by spending upon it larger and larger sums raised through Increased revenues from taxation . But there is. he adds , a question whether public education , as It . is today conducted . Is " costing more than its measurable results are worth . " The answer depends upon the quality of the education , and that in turn primarily upon the teacher . it may be argued that the public school is attempting too much . that It is spending more than is necessary in equipment , that it is not using its buildings economically , hut no one will contend that too trot ? h can he paid for that most precious thing  --  good teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TT training of any sort can provide . men and women who are equipped and ' frilling to serve youth as youth should be served , their service is pre-eminent . To the individual parent it Is quite the most appealing good after physical . health , and it Is altogether a more difficult service than any other to render well . If that service is " pre-eminent , " then its compensation should be commensurate . Yet everybody knows that the salaries of competent , " equipped and willing " teachers have never been so commensurate . There are other compensations. to be sure , of a social and personal nature , yet even these are not what they were in the days when salaries were even more meager but when living was simpler . It may be urged that not all are competent " to serve youth as youth should be served . " The answer to this observation is that the surest way to develop competence is to pay such salaries that the most promising young men and women can afford to spend time in training for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its Research Bulletin of March , 19al. and in Its Journal for April , 1925 , show that the median salary for elementary school teachers in cities of a population of over 100.000 is higher in the State of New York ( $:1.5-15 ) than in any other State . The next is Wisconsin , with a median salary of 52.401 ; then come Illinois with $2.387 , Colorado with 52.024 and Pennsylvania with 52,005 . In all the other States the median salaries are below $2,000 . That for ail cities of this range of population In the United States is $1,908 . New York 's median high school teacher 's salary is also the highest , $3,233 , as compared with the average of $2,536 . This is true also of the salaries of high . school principals . New York is sec : bond to Illinois . however , in'respect of I salaries of elementary school principals . When the comparison is extended to individual cities of a population exceeding 250,000 , it is shown that New York . City ranks pest as she should , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is surpassed by none in the initial salaries . Only Chi , cago , Newark an &; Jersey City seem to do a 13it better by their high school teachers . The people of this greatest school district in the United States may thus 3 , ave the satisfaction of knowing that the amounts of the salaries paid their public school teachers . individually and collectively , exceed those of any served . " other city . As to the relative purchasing power of these salaries it is difficult to make an estimate , but figures published by the National Educa-1 tion Association indicate that , taking the country over , the purchasing poweimof the higher city teacher 's salary in 1024 is 97.8 per cent . of that of the lower salary in 1913 . In New York State , where a very considerable and general increase was made in1920. it is probable that the purchasing power in 1924 was within this slight percentage of the 1913 mark , although the increase proposed . by the bill passed in the closing days of the Legislature , without discussion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 10 and 20 per cent . o ' the total amount of the teachers ' salaries now paid in New York City . It is not in these statistics , therefore , that warrant is to be found for the increase . It.must be found in the public appreciation of the " pre-eminent " service of the competent teacher . Unfortunately , the measures touching competency and merit received no attention from the Legislature . It was left to the teachers themselves to organize a. movement for the increase of their own salaries . Rut no consideration was given by the framers of the bill to the relative claims of the teachers in other communities of the State . The officials responsible for the general public educational policies of the State were not beard . Nor has the local hoard spoken officially . The Legislature gave the matter no serious study . The teachers were put in the humili ' sting posture of appearing to seek a Personal advantage . Their cause and their bill will now be considered by one who has before shown not only a sYnnnathetlo acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a courageous determination to do all that a Governor could do for the compensation of those who are willing " to serve youth as youth should be served .
