Those who saw Paul Berlenbach win the world 's lightheavyweight championship last year from that sly old Irish Reynard , Michael McTigue , were confident that he would not long retain it . He was no boxer , that was plain ; his one weapon was a left hook that crippled metaphor , but looked as easy to dodge as a freight train . He was not pretty to look at either , being a somewhat scarred ex-taxi-driver with a thick nose , thick jaw , thick mouth and a pair of cold , slow , brutal eyes . He seemed a fighter without imagination , he ever comes up against a fast man who can hit , he 'll be done for , " critics said . <P> Paul Berlenbach showed that he was not afraid to fight . He fought boxers and took what they had to give and tired them out ; he boxed fighters and hit harder than they did . In December he beat young Jack Delaney , a French-Canadian who could both dance and hit . Critics began to think better of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Delaney a return match-15 rounds to a decision . The cold eyes glinted slow malice ; the pale , hairy body moved forward , paused , swayed , moved forward . In the fifth round one of Delaney 's whizzing fists dropped Berlenbach to one knee . Berlenbach arose and moved forward with Delaney dancing in and out and more fists whizzing , now to Berlenbach 's crushed nose , now to his gloomy mouth , now to his heaving midriff . None of Berlenbach 's long , stiff blows were steered anywhere near dancing Delaney . At the end , the referee 's course was plain before him and he took it . The ladies of Bridgeport , Conn. , where amiable young Delaney trains and where he is often called " Gentleman Jack , " can now enlist , for their teas and charity sociables , not merely an obliging and handsome young exhibition boxer but the world 's champion lightheavyweight.
