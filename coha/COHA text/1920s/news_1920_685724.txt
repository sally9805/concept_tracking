" The creation of this unpleasant condition , " says Mr. MAHON , " was not with my . consent . " The local leaders who have criticised the Court " were not speak " ing for me or for the Amalgamated ' " Association . " Henceforward , however , the proceedings will be authorized . " I shall personally represent " the  --  Amalgamated Association and its , " policy .

" Even that part , of the public which is directly and seriously inconvenienced by a strike can be relied upon to side with the workmen if only it is convinced that their cause is just . Mr. 3,1 . A.HoN 's statement is a welcome indication that the leaders of the great labor organi , zations still preserve a sane outlook . It should insure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their due .
