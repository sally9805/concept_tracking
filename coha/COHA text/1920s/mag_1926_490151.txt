THE BUSINESS of thanking God that we are not as others are , is not , we flatter ourselves , one in which we generally indulge ; but we were not able to avoid twinges of complacency during Christmas week when a few cadets made themselves visible on the sidewalks . Our experiences during the war make us feel that the future we should least look forward to would be one which held out the promise that , if we worked real hard in our studies for two or three more years , we could become a Second Lieutenant . MARION TALLEY , the singer who once appealed to the imagination as young , beautiful , and struggling against great odds , undoubtedly achieved publicity by refusing to sing at a recital because every cent of her fee had not been paid her in advance It is too had that the public can never get at the facts of a thing of this sort . It would be interesting to know whether Miss Talky acted thus because she feels she is already famous enough to act as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her publicity agent . AT THIS TIME it behooves the guardian of morals and manners to comment on the institution of the Christmas Card , which is so warmly loved by some and so cordially hated by others . Shrinking never from duty , we pronounce that the Christmas Card in itself is not obnoxious , but that the people who collect their cards and display them on the mantel , in order to show how popular they are , are indubitably so . The way to treat such people is to invite them to tea , and to rush out to a store and buy several hundred left-over cards at reduced prices and litter the room with them . XT OT SO long ago an obscure hero got himself elected Mayor of a town in California on a platform of no booming , no good roads , no improvements and no plans for turning the pleasant town into a factory center ; and now the New York Skating Club has split up . It seems that a body of boomers got into the club and began to raise money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the original members soon found the place so noisy and crowded that they did n't like it . So they left ? and so you sec there are sensible people in the world . MR . EMORY BUCKNER , that pseudo-arch-enemy of the right of every citizen to buy his liquor when and where he pleases , has caused to ORM VW sae be issued his Christmas list of padlocks . Last year there were few places on his list that anyone had ever heard of , and this year there are none . Most of the padlocked speakeasies are in the suburbs , in Harlem , or in the Bronx . We note with relief that Buckner has apparently come , over to our side at last . THE ISSUING of a permit to build a bridge across the Hudson , the announcement that a man in an ordinary telephone booth in London has talked to a man in an ordinary telephone booth in New York , the prediction of Dr. Alexanderson that we will soon he able to see across the ocean , and the fling of plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twentieth Century is still young and that science is still in its infancy . What conveniences and marvels our grandchildren will be burdened with , Heaven alone knows . We are interested in these things  --  that is , we are about one one-hundredth as interested in them as we are in whether there will be skating over New Year 's Spirit AS THESE words strike the startled eye , Christmas is upon us . A desperate time , invariably . The climax of a desperate week . Woolworth 's a mad-house ; Fifth Avenue jammed ; Fourteenth Street a maelstrom . And yet the percentage of smiles over frowns has been amazing , rosch said in what is known as an aside : " Father should wear one of those Pullman signs : ' Quiet is requested for the benefit of those who have retired . ' " Charles Ringling WITH LAST week 's talk of Mr. John Ringling 's losing the controlling interest in the Madison Square Garden came reminiscences of his brother Charles . It was Charles 's death , early this month , that released the shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With John he was the last of the seven circus Ringling brothers . In his own right he was one of America 's twenty-five richest men . Tall , with a very red face , a gold watch chain across his prosperous stomach , he was seen from time to time on Fifth Avenue , perhaps entering his apartment at No. 636 . His friends speak of him as a kindly man , vain , charitable , shrewd in business , passionately fond of the circus . Its atmosphere was all about him . He carried it into his Fifth Avenue apartment , setting off the carefully planned Louis Quatorze furniture with circus posters , Yale banners and glaring paintings of bare-back riders and trapeze artists . This home was a huge duplex affair with four enormous drawing rooms on the lower floor , the chef diceuvre of which was a very small grand piano , enamelled white . - On it was painted a complete circus menagerie . A toy bull-dog which opened its mouth and wagged its head invariably stood upon it . CHARLES RINGLING 'S real pride , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year or two ago at Sarasota , Florida . He and his brother John owned half a million acres of land on the West Coast of Florida , and into the raising of celery and asparagus he put almost as much energy as he put into the circus . The house was of Moorish design , with walls of golden brown containing mosaic inlays of brilliant blues and reds . A railroad siding was laid to it so that the owner might ride to his door in his private car  --  a phenomenon among pri va.te cars -- whose interior was of gilt and white enamel . From the grounds was built a pier to which the Ringlings ' yachts , Zelophus and Zelophus Jr. , might attach themselves ; and a tower overlooking much of the Ringling domain was erected . The interior of the house was Italian , its halls cluttered with art treasures wedged in between huge cloisonn ? jars , which were kept in meticulous order by Arab servants with flowing moustaches and turbans . Charles 's supreme effort went into the design of his own bedroom . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The floor had an edging of green marble and a strip of light parTHE NEW YORKER 13 It was in Peking that art made its first serious impression on him , but he indulged the urge not as a painter but as a collector . He has given and lent splendid collections of Oriental work to the Metropolitan Museum . He continued commercial pursuits until the Chinese rediscovered gunpowder and went in for uprisings , which moment he chose to proceed to Manila , where he edited a newspaper and served as a local judge . He returned to America to become a director of the Remington Arms Company and left that position to become a dollar-a-year man during the fairly recent war . It was after that ended that he thought of painting . Solicitous friends failed to change his mind and he fitted up a studio . That was five years ago . His first exhibition two years ago was so successful ? ? ( all thirty of his pictures were sold ) that he boldly rebuffed an offer of a trading corporation post at $100,000 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town so small that even Baedeker has overlooked it . He chose it because Maurice Stern ; who had once expressed approval of his work , lived there . In Italy he paints when the spirit  --  and an ingeniously-equipped motor  --  move him . The car is fitted out with drawers containing easels , brushes and colors . Mr. Bruce rides about the countryside in it until the prospect pleases , then sets up his studio in an open field and paints . The present exhibition at the New Gallery has the inevitable coincidence . George Hellman , the head of that in ? stitution , was athletic manager at Columbia when Mr. Bruce was a football attraction The two now disdain sport as a subject for discussion , but argue at length on the finality of art . In one of these debates recently Mr. Hellman ventured the opinion that a certain canvas by Mr. Bruce was not , perhaps , so good . The artist , knowing his " Dorian Gray , " took out his knife and slashed it irreparably . It was priced at $2,000.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
