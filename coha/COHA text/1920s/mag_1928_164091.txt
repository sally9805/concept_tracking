The Chinese press of Peking told excitedly in dainty , complex characters , last week , strange news of the great but fallen Scholar War Lord , Wu Pei-fu . <P> Chinese readers scanned the ideographs and saw in their minds eye a far , high monastery in remote Tibet . They read of how Wu Pei-fu had journeyed thither from China , traveling by wearisome forced marches until he reached the monastery and was welcomed by its Buddhist brotherhood . Even in so remote a place , men know that Marshal Wu Pei-fu was War Lord of Central China prior to his overthrow by the Nationalist Revolution ( TIME , Oct. 25 , 1926 ) . <P> The story hinted at much stately converse between Wu Pei-fu and the Buddhist abbot of the monastery . The War Lord who has been all his life a scholar , and a great one , was said to have explained that his last military followers had finally deserted him , and that he wished to become a bonze or Buddhist monk and to retire utterly from the world . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a son ? <P> The final news that Wu Pei-fu had actually become a bonze brought forth in the Peking press a grim description of his initiation : 1 ) The hour chosen was midnight , at which time the whole assembly of the monastery knelt in its Temple ; 2 ) The crux of the ceremony was to burn deep into the shaved head of Wu Pei-fu nine brands , each the width of a man 's thumb , and serving to remind him of his nine vows as a Buddhist priest ; 3 ) The branding was made endurable by covering his scalp ( except on the spots to be branded ) with pieces of raw turnip , damp and coolingly efficacious . <P> Occidental skeptics at Peking pointed out , last week , that the ceremony just described is common enough in the Buddhist monasteries of China but differs slightly from Tibetan practice . They doubted the exactness of the Chinese newspapers as to details , but hoped that Scholar Wu Pei-fu has indeed attained a seclusion and a retirement congenial to his tastes .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
