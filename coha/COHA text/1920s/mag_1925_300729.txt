Bankers have for some time been predicting slightly higher money rates for this winter . The first official recognition of this coming trend was supplied by the quite unexpected action of the Boston Reserve Bank in moving its rediscount rate up from 3% to 4% . It is now expected that the New York Reserve Bank will soon follow suit with a similar rate advance , and that the ten other Reserve Banks will shortly swing into line by a similar action . <P> Two features of the Boston rate-action have puzzled bankers , particularly in New York . They wonder why the Boston rather than the New York Bank should in this case be the first institution to start the upward movement . Formerly almost all general changes in Reserve rates have been initiated by the New York Bank as representative of the money-centre of the country . Also , there is much curiosity over the question as to just what local conditions in Boston , if any , should have made it advisable to start the rate-advance . <P> Meanwhile , a higher rate for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change would permit the New York Federal Reserve Bank to lift its rate to 4% without causing a flow of gold from Britain to this country-a most undesirable development in the British effort to hold sterling exchange at par . In England the Boston rate-move is thought to foreshadow an advance by the Bank of England .
