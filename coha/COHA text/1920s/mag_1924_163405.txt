Juan J. Tomadelli , of Buenos Aires , purporting to be an eminent electrical engineer , sold stock in his " Electronic Corporation " at $100 a share . He claimed to have invented , in his laboratory at Buenos Aires , a lamp which , by withdrawing energy from the air and bombarding a substance composed of sea salt , tin , copper , asphalt and paraffin , burned continuously for seven months , needed no recharging , and would have burned on till the substance disintegrated , had the laboratory not been destroyed by lightning . Suit was brought against him in the New York State Supreme Court . Many of his statements were proved false or were at variance with known scientific laws . Two disinterested illuminating engineers , Cyprian O. Maillaux and Clayton H. Sharp , after investigating the plant at Harrison , N. J. , reported : " Nothing was shown which would convince us that the apparatus has any practical application , or that it has any industrial or commercial value . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
