Gifford Pinchot , Governor of Pennsylvania , last week called to consult with him John L. Lewis , President of the United Mine Workers of America , and soon afterwards Major W. W. Inglis , representative of the anthracite mine operators . There was no secret about why he wanted to see them . He wanted to end the anthracite strike which has endured since Sept. 1 . What actually passed was indeed secret . Apparently the miners were not willing to give up their demand for higher wages and the checkoff , nor were the operators willing to yield either of these points . When his visitors had gone , Governor Pinchot said nothing . He turned his back on Harrisburg , the state capital , and went to his Milford home to think matters over for ten days or so . <P> He has plenty to think about . Under his feet is Pennsylvania . Under his feet is practically all the hard coal in the U. S. If it is in his power to take some decisive step , it is also in his power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. , and in doing that to affect powerfully for good or ill the prosperity of his state . <P> He has had a remarkable career to this point and , although he is now 60 , he may or may not have a yet more remarkable career ahead of him . He comes of French stock . His grandfather , Constantino Cyril Desir Pinchot , quit France " because of political beliefs . . . . " Gifford , born in Connecticut in 1865 , went to Phillips Exeter Academy and to Yale College , where he was graduated in 1889 . Out of college he went to France , studied forestry at Nancy , practiced it in the Alps and the Vosges . By 1891 he was back and doing " the first systematic forestry work ever done in the U. S. , " on the estate of George W. Vanderbilt near Asheville , N. C. The same year he opened an office in New York as consulting forester . <P> In 1898 he entered the Government service as Chief of the Division of Forestry in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and during that time the personnel under him increased from 11 to 2,000 . He became a favorite of President Roosevelt , who regarded him as one of his most efficient subordinates . President Roosevelt made him a member of the Commission on Public Lands and numerous other efficiency and conservation bodies . He was made Chairman of the National Conservation Commission . <P> In 1910 President Taft ousted Pinchot for his attack on Richard A. Ballinger , Secretary of the Interior , who had become involved in a forestry scandal . His removal was apparently the end of his officeholding career . Senator Boies Penrose , who called him " Pin-shot , " was his enemy and it did not look as if there was any political advancement for him in Pennsylvania . In 1920 , to be sure , he was made State Forester . <P> Then came 1922 . There was a split in the regular Republican machine , and Mr. Pinchot-who would believe it ? - was elected Governor . He gave Pennsylvania a budget system , trimmed the sails of expenditure and set out to put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Government and cut the number of departments and bureaus from more than 100 to 18 . He also went out to enforce prohibition .
