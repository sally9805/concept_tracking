OF the men the noteworthy men ? with whom I became acquainted before I had escaped from the torture of my last examination at Oxford , most had a taste for literature , while some had achieved renown in it . Of these , however , the first with whom I became intimate was one whose literary connections were vicarious rather than personal . My friendship with him originated in the fact that he was an old friend of my relatives , the Froudes , and , as soon as Chelston Cross was completed , he would pay them protracted visits there . This was the then Lord Wentworth , who for me was a magical being because he was Byron 's grandson . Another acquaintance who brought with him a subtle aroma of poetry was Went-worth 's remarkable brother-in-law , frid Blunt , then the handsomest of our younger English diplomatists , a breeder of Arab horses , and also the author of love poems which deserve beyond all comparison more attention than they have yet received . Others again were Robert Browning , Ruskin , Carlyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in London , but to those whom I came to know through the William Froudes at Torquay , may be added Aubery de Vere , the Catholic poet of Ireland , Lord Houghton , Lord Lytton , the novelist , and the second Lord Lytton , his son , known to all lovers of poetry under pseudonym of " Owen Meredith . " Of the well-known visitors who wintered at Torquay none was more punctual in his appearance than Lord Houghton , who found an annual home there in the house of two maiden aunts . Through these long-established residents he had for years been familiar with my family , and from the first occasion on which I met him he exhibited a friendship almost paternal for myself . Lord Houghton was a man who , as Dryden said of Shadwell , would have been the wittiest writer in the world if his books had been equal to his conversation . Certainly nothing which he wrote , or which a biographer has written about him , gives any idea of the gifts ? a very peculiar mixture ? which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence animated . He knew everybody of note in the fashionable and semi-fashionable world , and many who belonged to neither , such as the Tichbourne claimant , and Calcraft , the com mon hangman ; and his views of life from whatever point he looked at it , were expressed with a weighty brilliance or a sub-cynical humor . He was once sitting at dinner by the celebrated Lady E- of T ? , who was indulging in a long lament over the social decadence of the rising male generation . " When I was a girl , " she said , " all the young men in London were at my feet . " " My dear lady , " said Lord Houghton , " were all the young men of your generation chiropodists ? " Mr. C. Milnes Gaskell of Thornes told me of a. perplexing situation in which he had once found himself , and of how he sought counsel about it from Lord Houghton , his kinsman . Gaskell 's difficulty was this . A friend for whom lie was acting as trustee had , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged him with his dying breath to carry out certain instructions . These seemed to Gaskell extremely unwise and objectionable , " and yet , " so he said to Lord Houghton , " of course a peculiar sanctity attaches itself to dying wishes . What would you do in such a situation as mine ? " For a little while Lord Houghton reflected , and then answered , with an air of grave detachment , " I always tell my family totally to disregard everything I say during the last six months of my life . " Of his social philosophy otherwise he gave me in the days of my youth many pithy expositions , with hints as to what I should do when I entered the world myself . One of his pieces of advice was especially appropriate to Torquay . This was to make the acquaintance of old Mr. Bevan , a lifelong intimate of his own . Accordingly , my introduction to this mysterious personage was accomplished . Mr. Bevan lived in a large villa close to that occupied by Miss Burdett , . Colitis . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . gave , when viewed externally , the impression that it was asleep or tenantless ; but to ring the front-door bell was to dissipate this impression immediately . The portals seemed to open by clockwork . Heavy curtains were withdrawn by servitors half seen in the twilight , and VOL . CXL. ? No. 840. - 93 the visitors were committed to the care of an Austrian groom of the chambers , who , wearing the aspect of a king that had stepped out of the Almanach de Gotha , led the way over soundless carpets to a library . This was furnished with a. number of deep arm-chairs ; and I recollect how , on the first occasion of my entering it , each of these chairs was monopolized by a drowsy Persian cat . For a moment , the light being dim , these cats , so it seemed to me , were the sole living things present ; but a second later I was aware that a recumbent figure was slowly lifting itself from a sofa . This was Mr. Bevan . His attire was a blue silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , varnished hoots , and a neck-tie with a huge pearl pin in it , the pearl itself representing the forehead of a human skull . His hands were like ivory , his face was like a clear-cut cameo . With the aid of a gold-headed cane that had once belonged to Voltaire he gently evicted a cat , so that I might occupy the chair next to him , and said , in the language of Brummel 's time , that he was " monstrous glad to see me . " He pointed to objects of interest which adorned his walls and tables , such as old French fashion-plates of ladies in very scanty raiment ; to musical clocks , of which several were presents from crowned heads ; to sketches by D'Orsay , and to framed tickets for Air/sack 's . " Whenever the dear lady next door , " he said , with a glance at the semi-nudities of theFrench fashion-plates , and alluding to Miss Burdett-Coutts , " comes to have a dish of tea with me , I have to lock those things up . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in a shocking bad odor with her now . " Only last night , he explained , he had received from one of the French Rothschilds a magnificent pate de foie Bras ; and , having himself no parties in prospect , he sent this gastronomical treasure to Miss Coutts , who was about to entertain , as he knew , a large company at luncheon . There was one thing , however , which he did not know ? the luncheon was to be given to the members of a certain society which had for its object the protection of edible animals from any form of treatment by which they might be needlessly incommoded . What , then , were the feelings of the hostess when she suddenly discovered that a dish which , with Mr. Bevan 's compliments , had been solemnly placed before her , was the most atrocious of all the abominations which the company had assembled to denounce ! " It was sent back to me , " said Mr. Bevan , " as though it were the plague in person . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd ask you to dinner if only I were sure of my new cook . My last cook was with me for twenty years . Shall I tell you what he wrote in a letter when he had left me to join the army during the Franco-German War ? ' Alas , monsieur , ' he said , ' I must now make sorties instead of entrees . " ' The banquet , however , which Mr. Bevan bad suggested ? and it was followed by others ? took place before many days were over . The guests numbered eight or nine . I can not recollect who they were ; but the cooking , the wines , and the decorations of the table would have satisfied Oujda , herself . The china , covered with royal crowns , was a gift from Louis Philippe . The wines , of which the names and dates were murmured by the servants who dispensed them , seemed all to have come from the cellars of a Rothschild or an Austrian Emperor , while every dish was a delicacy unique in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of " trifle , " which the artistry of a chef had converted into the form of a Pope 's tiara . Mr. Bevan , in short , was a model of the ultra-fastidious man of the world as he figures in the novels of Bulwer Lytton and Disraeli . I mentioned this impression of him some time afterward to Lord Houghton , and he said , " There 's a very good reason for it . When Bulwer Lytton and Disraeli entered the London world , Mr. Bevan was one of their earliest friends . He privately helped Disraeli in social and . other ways . To him Bulwer Lytton owed his first personal knowledge of the then world of the dandies ; and Mr. Bevan , " said Lord Houghton , " was the actual model from which , by both these writers , their pictures of the typical man of the world were drawn . " My acquaintance with Mr. Bevan , however , and even that with Lord Houghton , were but minor experiences as compared with another meeting of a similar yet contrasted kind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British author whose influence as a philosophic moralist eclipsed that of any of his contemporaries . This writer was Carlyle . His fame was then at its highest , and the moral consciousness of ultra-polite drawing-rooms was being stirred to its well-dressed depths , more by his celebrated attack on " the dandies " in his book , Sailor Resartus , which many earnest persons were accepting as a new revelation . I was myself sufficiently familiar with its pages , and , though some of them roused may antagonism , I could not deny their genius . One morning , during a brief visit to London , I received a note from Mr. Froude , the historian , asking me to come to luncheon , and I duly arrived at his house , not knowing what awaited inc . I presently learned that he was going to introduce me to Carlyle , and , as soon as luncheon was over , he walked me off to Chelsea . In a fitting state of awe I found myself at last in the great philosopher 's presence . When we entered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at first I saw nothing but his back , which was covered with a Iong , shapeless , and extravagantly dirty dressing-gown . When he rose to meet us , his manners were as rough as his integument . His welcome to myself was an inarticulate grunt , unmistakably Scotch in its intonation ; and his first act was to move across the room to the fireplace and light a " churchwarden " pipe by sticking its head between the bars . As I watched him perform this rite , I noticed that close to the fender was a pair of very dirty slippers . To me these things and proceedings were so many separate shocks , the result of my reflections being this : If you represent fame , let me represent obscurity . But worse was still to come . It was presently proposed that we should all go out for a walk , and as soon as we were in the open air , the philosopher blew his nose in a pair of old woolen gloves . I here saw at once an illustration of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he christened , " The Sect of the Dandies , " as described and glorified by Bulwer Lytton in Pelham . Illustration could not go further . The next very famous man whom I met after this glimpse of Carlyle was a little later at Torquay ? Lord Lytton himself . He was dining at Chelston Cross , and , owing to some lady 's defection , I was actually his nearest neighbor . I saw in him everything which the spirit of Carlyle hated . I saw in him everything which was then in my opinion admirable . All the arts of appearance , conversation , and demeanor which in Carlyle were aggressively absent , were in him exhibited in a manner perhaps even too apparent . I was indeed , despite my reverence for him , faintly conscious myself that his turquoise shirt-stud , set with diamonds , was too large , and that his coat would have been in better taste had the cuffs not been of velvet . But it seemed to me that from his eyes , keen , authoritative , and melancholy , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences of the world were peering . To have sat by him was an adventure ; to have been noticed by him was not far from a sacrament . Before very long , and likewise at Chelston Cross , I became acquainted with his son , " Owen Meredith , " afterward Viceroy of India . Having heard that , like him , I was touched with the fever of the Muses , he at once showed me signs of an amity which ended only with his life . Treating me as though I were a man of the same age as himself , hewould take my arm , when wandering in the Froude 's shrubberies , and describe to me the poems to the production of which his future years would be conse-Crated , or ask me to confide to him my corresponding ambitions in return , Like most poets , he was not without personal vanities ; but never was a man more free from anything like jealousy of a rival . To praise others was a pleasure to him as natural as that of being praised himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was introduced , not at Torquay , but at Oxford . There was one , however , whom , though essentially an Oxonian , I first met at Torquay . This was Jowett , the renowned Master of Balliol , to whose college I was destined to be subsequently either a disgrace or ornament . Jowett was at Torquay frequently , having a sister who lived there , and he was specially asked to luncheon at Chelston Cross to inspect me , and see how I should pass muster as one of his own disciples . His blinking eyes , the fresh pink of his cheeks , his snow-white hair , and the birdlike treble of his voice , have been often enough described , and I will only say of them here that , when he took me fur a walk in the garden , I subconsciously felt them ? I can not tell why ? to be formidable . He inquired as to my tastes and interests with a species of curt benignity ; but to my interest in poetry he exhibited a most disconcerting indifference , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was walking with a mild east wind . In this he was a marked contrast to Ruskin , Robert Browning , and certain others ? especially to " Owen Meredith " ? men between whom and myself there was at once some half-conscious bond . There are no estrangements so elusive , and yet so insuperable , as those which arise from subtle discords in temperament . And yet in certain individual acts , to which I shall refer presently , Jowett treated me , when I was safely settled at Oxford , with much sympathetic good nature . My experiences at Oxford I may divide into two groups ? namely , those belonging to the social life of an undergraduate , and those consisting of the effects ? philosophical , moral , or religious ? produced in an undergraduate 's mind by the influence of academic teaching . As to my social experiences , my recollections are , on the whole , pleasurable , but they are somewhat remote from anything that can properly be called scholastic . They are associated with the charm of certain cloistered buildings ? with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; with country drives in dog-carts to places like Witney and Abingdon ; with dinners there in the summer evenings , and with a sense of being happily outside the radius of caps and gowns ; with supper-parties during the race-weeks to various agreeable ladies ; and with a certain concert which , during one Commemoration , was given by myself and a friend to a numerous company , and for which the mayor was good enough to lend us the town hall , From the incubus of mere collegiate discipline I was perhaps more free than nine undergraduates out of ten . At the time when I matriculated there were within the college precincts no quarters available , and I and a fellow-freshman , who was in the same position as myself , managed to secure a suite of unusually commodious lodgings . That particular partnership lasted only for a term , but subsequently T and two other companions took the whole upper part of a large house between us . We were never what is called " in college " ; we rarely dined in hall , having , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own , where we gave little dinners , much to our own contentment . We had , moreover , a spare bedroom , in which on occasion we could put up a visitor . One visitor who stayed with us for some weeks was Wentworth . Little things remain in the mind when greater things are forgotten ; and one little incident which 1 remember of Wentworth 's visit was this . Those were days when , for some mysterious reason , men , when they smoked , were accustomed to wear smoking-caps . Wentworth had one of Oriental design , which he would somehow attach to his head by means of a t jeweled pin . One evening when he was adjusting it the light caught his features at some peculiar angle , and for a fugitive moment his face was an exact and living reproduction of one of the best-known , portraits of Byron . To return , however , to the first week or fortnight which saw me and my original house-mate established as full-blown freshmen ; I can not for the life of me remember by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he and I were told with very surprising promptitude that we should , without loss of time , give a breakfast to the Balliol Eight . We did so , and never before had I seen on any one matutinal table-cloth provisions which weighed so much , or disappeared so rapidly . Not many days later I found myself at another breakfast-table of a very different character , in the capacity not of host , but guest . The host on this occasion was Jowett , who asked me to breakfast with him in order that I might meet Browning . Browning by some one or other ? I think it was James Spedding ? had been shown certain manuscript verses ? precious verses of my own . He had sent me a message of a flattering kind with regard to them , and he now held out both his hands to me with an almost boisterous cordiality . His eyes sparkled with laughter , his beard was carefully trimmed , and an air of fashion was exhaled from his dazzling white waistcoat . He did not embarrass me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , so far as I remember , make any approach to the subject of literature at all , but reduced both Jowett and myself to something like complete silence by a constant flow of anecdotes and social allusions , which , though not deficient in point , had more in them of jocularity than wit . He was not , perhaps , my ideal of the author of " Men and Women , " or the singer of " Lyric Love " as " a wonder and a wild desire " ; but there the great man was , and when I quitted his presence and found myself once more in undergraduate circles , I felt myself shining like Moses when he came down from the mount . I was subsequently enveloped in a further reflected glory , due also to Jowett 's kindness ? a kindness which survived many outbursts of what I thought somewhat petulant disapproval . I received from him one day a curt invitation to dinner , and presented myself , wondering mildly to what this mark of favor could be due . But wonder turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I discovered in the dim twilight no other figure than his own . His manner , however , though not effusive , was civil , and was certainly fraught with no menace of any coming judgment on my sins . We exchanged some ordinary observations on the weather and kindred topics . Then , looking over his shoulder , he uttered a half-audible word or two , which , being plainly not addressed to me , must have been addressed to somebody else . Presently out of the shadows a somebody else emerged . This was a person remarkable for the large size of his head , his longish hair , his insignificant stature , and his singularly sloping shoulders . I was introduced to him without catching his name . Dinner was announced forthwith . It was evident that , except for myself , this person was to be the sole ; nest . In the candle-light of the dinner-able I realized that this person was iwinburne . The dinner passed off pleasantly . ; winburne showed himself an intelligent , hough by no means a brilliant talker ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where we drank a cup coffee standing , Jowett , who had some igagement , abruptly left us to finish the , ening by ourselves . On Swinburne the feet of the master 's disappearance was agical . His manner and aspect began to exhibit a change like that of the moon when a dim cloud drifts away from it . Of what we discussed at starting I have not the least remembrance , but before very long Swinburne was on the subject of poetry . His observations at first consisted of general criticisms . Then he began to indulge in quotations from various poems ? none of them , I think , from his own ; but however this may have been , the music seemed to intoxicate him . The words began to thrill me with the spell of his own recitation of them . Here at last I realized the veritable genius who had made the English language a new instrument of passion . Here at last was the singer for whose songs my ears were shells which still murmured with such lines as I had first furtively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own appreciation as a listener more and more encouraged him . If he began a quotation sitting , lie would start from his chair to finish it . Finally he abandoned the restraints of a chair altogether . He began , with gesticulating arms , to pace the room from one end to the other , reciting passage after passage , and appealing to me , who managed to keep pace with him , for applause . " The most beautiful lines that Tennyson ever wrote , " he exclaimed , " were these , from Maud ' : " That like a silent lightning under the stars She seem 'd to divide in a dream from a band of the blest . " " Yes , " he went on , " and what did the dream-Maud tell her lover when she had got him ? That the salvation of the world depended on the Crimean War and the prosecution of Lord Palmerston 's policy , " Finally he strayed into quotations from Sidney Dobell , a writer now hardly remembered , with one of which , describing a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " She , with her body bright sprinkles the waters white , Which flee from her fair form , and flee in vain , Dyed with the dear unutterable sight , And circles out her beauties to the circling main . " He was almost shouting these words when another sound became audible ? that of an opening door , followed by Jowett 's voice , which said , in high-pitched syllables , " You 'd both of you better go to bed now . " My next meeting with Swinburne took place not many days later . He had managed meanwhile to make acquaintance with a few other undergraduates all of them enthusiastic worshipers ? one of whom arranged to entertain him at luncheon . As I could not , being otherwise engaged , be present at this feast myself , I was asked to join the party as soon as possible afterward . I arrived at a fortunate moment . Most of the guests were still sitting at a table covered with dessert-dishes . Swinburne was much at his ease in an arm-chair near the fireplace , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed , to be not only interesting , but in some way entertaining also . He was , as I presently gathered , about to begin an account of a historical drama by himself , which existed in his memory only ? a sort of parody of what Victor Hugo might have - written had he dramatized English events at the opening of the reign of Queen Victoria . The vivacity and mischievous humor with which Swinburne gave his account of this projected play exhibited a side of his character which I have never even seen mentioned , and the appreciation and surprise of his audience were obviously a great delight to him . He lay back in his chair , tossed off a glass of port , and presently his mood changed . Somehow or other he got to his own serious poems ; and before we knew where we were , he was pouring out an account of Poe-ms and Ballads , and explaining their relation to the secrets of his own experiences . There were three poems , he said , which beyond all the rest were biographical ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " The Garden of Proserpine . " " The Triumph of Time " was a monument to the sole real love of his life ? a love which had been the tragic destruction of all his faith in woman . " Dolores " expressed the passion with which he had sought relief , in the madnesses of the fleshly Venus , from his ruined dreams of the heavenly . " The Garden of Proserpine " expressed his revolt against the flesh and its fevers , and his longing to find a refuge from them in a haven of undisturbed rest . His audience , who knew these three poems by heart , held their breaths as they listened to the poet 's own voice , imparting its living tones to passages such as the following : This is from " The Triumph of Time " : " I will say no word that a man may say . Whose whole life 's love goes down in a day ; For this could never have been ; and never , Though the gods and the years relent , shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 garment not golden , but gilded , 0 garden where all men may dwell , 0 tower not of ivory , but builded By hands that reach heaven from hell . " This is from " The Garden of Proserpine " : " From too much love of living , From hope and fear set free , We thank with brief thanksgiving Whatever gods may be That no life lives forever , That dead men rise up never ; That . even the weariest river Winds somewhere safe to sea . " Then , like a man waking up from a dream , Swinburne turned to our host , and said , nervously , " Can you give me another glass of port ? " His glass wal filled ; he emptied it at a single draft and then lay back in his chair like a chile who had gone to sleep , the actual fac being , as his host soon recognized , that in homely language , he was drunk . I associate my early days at Ballic with yet another memorable meeting One of the most prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Henry Acland , who , as a Devonshire man , knew many of my relations , and had also heard something about myself . He was a friend and entertainer of men of all sorts of eminence ; and while I was still more or less a freshman he invited me to join at his house a very small company in the evening , the star of the occasion being a university lecturer on art , who was just entering on his office , and whose name was illustrious wherever the English language was spoken . He , too , knew something about me , having been shown some of my verses , and to meet him was one of my cherished dreams . Only half a dozen people were present , and from a well-known portrait of him by Millais I recognized his form at once . This was Ruskin . He had sent me , through Lord Houghton or somebody , a verbal message of poetic appreciation already . I was now meeting him in the flesh . The first thing in him which struck me was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely and almost plaintively simple , but that of no diplomat or courtier could be more polished in what was at once its weighty and its winning dignity . Such was his charm for the elect ; but here again comes the question of temperament . Between Ruskin and Jowett there was a temperamental antipathy . An antipathy of this kind is a very different thing from any reasoned dislike , and of this general fact Ruskin and Jowett were types . I was myself another . Just as Jowett repelled , so Ruskin attracted me . During my later days at Oxford I grew to know Ruskin intimately , and my sympathy with his genius never lost its loyalty , though for a long time certain of his ideas ? that is to say , ideas relating to social politics ? were to me barely intelligible , and though , when they became intelligible , I regarded them as perversely mischievous .
