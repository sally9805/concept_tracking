The Story* of how James O'brien , he that had been Ireland 's curly-headed rebel poet before he hushed his tongue and earned the name of Jimmy the Hangman for sitting , iron-jowled , on a high bench of justice as Lord Glenmalure ; of how this man married his sweet daughter Connaught to John d'Arcy , a tricky swipe but polished , instead of to fine young Dermot McDermot of Dermotstown , as brave a lad of the old land as was in it , so that she might be a great lady and go about the world instead of stopping always in the quiet country among horses , dogs and simple folk ; and of what came of it , including the talk that Jimmy the Hangman 's house was haunted after his death until it blazed to the ground-all this is a strange , touching story that might or might not have happened just as it did ; and no great matter , either , if likelihood is sometimes owed small debts . <P> What matters most is the manner of its telling by young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his other writing , is a book for men of the old country that is on them all like a spell-men who surely owe him a hearty " God bless the work ! " <P> It was the young gentleman 's intention that his countrymen might find in the book much that would take them home from wherever they might be on the earth . So he wrote of the fragrance and spaciousness of an Irish mansion as old as the green sod it stood in . He kept bringing in the sweep of Irish history through the ancient family trees-old kings and warriors and battles from Queen Maeve in the day of giants to tart Timothy Healy , and the Fenian men humming the " Shan Van Voght , " the Song of Defeat , which is through the book like a soft threat . <P> He made Connaught O'brien with dusky hair and slender perfections and a strong but quiet tongue , and Dermot McDermot honorable , sure in his saddle and loved by dogs-of which there are many about-terriers , deerhounds , foxhound packs and puppies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these two as a slow , certain thing of wry humor and restrained ecstasy , and , as the Irish are , a little sad . <P> There is a stirring meet of ladies and gentlemen on their tall horses to find , chase and kill , with due ceremony , that somewhat mystical reddish mister , Dan Russell the fox , with impudent wisdom seeking sanctuary from a choir of hounds . There is a mighty steeplechase with the bookies hawking odds , the hoofs thundering and two poor jocks killed . There is lambing-time , on the spring hills thinly lit with frost and starlight ; and coursing the whippets after Pussy , the dodging hare ; and benign old gentlemen in red coats " hacking bitterly at small white balls and saying very evil phrases . . . . " <P> The brown bees of Ireland are never forgotten , in their clean skips by golden-thatched cottages . And blue turf smoke is there , and all the birds of Ireland . . . . <P> " The wren , the wren , the king of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
