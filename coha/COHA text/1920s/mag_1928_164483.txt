The naturally ruddy cheeks of Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill were flushed by fever , last week , on the morning when his new Budget ( TIME , May 7 ) came up for debate in the House of Commons . <P> Characteristically the Chancellor ignored the warning of his doctor 's thermometer , and rushed impetuously into the verbal fray . He found the Laborites preparing to attack his new tax on petroleum fuels from a shrewd angle . They were about to plead with fervor the cause of **33;12834;TOOLONG . <P> Since the rural lamp burning vote is combustible , Chancellor Churchill acted with instant decision , and extinguished the Labor attack by announcing that he had decided , overnight , to exempt kerosene from the tax , which , however , will still bear on gasoline . Well pleased at the flurry caused by his announcement , Mr. Churchill added : " His Majesty 's Government have no fear that motorists will evade the tax on gasoline by attempting to use kerosene . They would do more harm to their engines than to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budget with spirit , for some hours , careless or unconscious of his rising fever . Suddenly , however , he was seen to sway , and then to hurry from the House . A moment later he sped by motor up broad Whitehall to his nearby official residence at No. 11 Downing Street-next door to famed " No. 10 , " the residence of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin . Soon Mr. Churchill was tucked into bed . A doctor who could not presume to say I-told-you-so declared firmly that Chancellor Churchill had a seemingly not dangerous case of influenza but must not stir abroad for at least a week . <P> In the Commons debate was renewed , and savagely , upon the Budget . Tough , veteran Laborites such as the Rt . Hon. Philip Snowden-Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1924-licked anticipatory chops when they saw that Chancellor Churchill had sent as his deputy , Mr. Arthur Michael Samuel , Financial Secretary of the Treasury. * <P> Unfortunately for Expert Samuel a back bencher of the Chancellor 's own party ( Conservative ) arose and protested that a reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Churchill taxes , namely that on British-made cigaret lighters . Against this proposal Expert Samuel , determined to defend his influenza-stricken Chief , set his lips and remained firm . He was then indiscreetly approached by Colonial Secretary Colonel Leopold C. M. S. Amery ( strong , speechless man of the Cabinet ) , who whispered in his ear . At the conclusion of this dramatic whispering Expert Samuel reversed his decision of a moment before and consented audibly to a reduction of the tax on lighters . Thereby he gave the Laborites a prime chance to whoop , heckle and deride him as a soup-will , a ninny-pinny . <P> Within five minutes the pandemonium was such that a disgusted Briton in the gallery hurled his hat down upon the floor of the House , exclaiming : " Shut up , you bloody fools ! " Oddly enough , this quieted the tumult ; but as it subsided crippled Philip Snowden grinned upon Expert Samuel , and remarked : " I do not envy the Financial Secretary when he meets the convalescent Chancellor of the Exchequer .
