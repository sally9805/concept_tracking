En route to France aboard the little steamship Sphynx , General Maurice Sarrail , the recalled French High Commander to Syria ( TIME , Nov. 9 ) , employed a graceful and evasive " formula " for sidestepping ail questions regarding his much criticized bombardment of Damascus . Said he to correspondents who boarded the Sphynx at Alexandria , " Surely you need not question me , gentlemen . Let the Sphynx answer . Look around the boat and you will find many sources of truth . " <P> A speedily discovered " source " proved to be the official report of General Gamelin , successor to General Sarrail until the new Provisional High Commander , General Duport , was able to reach Damascus . It read , in part , as follows : <P> " The Military Command is conscious of having obtained in the minimum time at a minimum cost the result sought : preventing the extension of a subversive movement at Damascus which might have easily developed into a revolution of the first order . " <P> Certain " spokesmen " aboard the Sphynx " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation well in hand in Syria . . . . Then we were attacked at Damascus by rebels . . . and as I could not surrender the town there had to be fighting in the streets . . . . The British consul very nearly provoked a panic when I told him that I must bombard the Moslem quarters of the town . . . . The romantic versions of the affair in the English press indicate that somebody wanted to give the public its money 's worth . . . . The French Government has always received full reports from me , except during three successive days when the cable service was interrupted . . . . I stopped the pillage ; that was the extent of my military oppression . . . and I am conscious of having done my best to fulfill the French mandate in Syria . " <P> Upon his arrival at Marseilles , General Sarrail was directly quoted as follows : " The truth is that the Druses , the Pan-Arab party and Abd-el-Krim , are all one . The recent events in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May in Morocco . " <P> Cables from Damascus reported that the city was last week undergoing practically a state of siege . The French were naturally dominant in the urban quarters by virtue of their artillery , but encircling bands of tribesmen were said to have kept up a practically uninterrupted series of raids on the suburbs . By night large parties of Druses apparently attacked and destroyed portions of the waterworks of Damascus . Over 25,000 of the citizens were estimated to have fled at the beginning of last week . <P> Despatches asserted that outside of Damascus the French forces held a secure grip upon only six cities on the railway between Aleppo in the North and Dera in the South . The Druses were said to be in control of an area as large as the state of New Jersey between Mount Hermon and Wadi Ajami . At Aleppo Miss Elizabeth Sill of Pittsburgh , in charge of the local Near East Relief , was reported to have been appealed to for help and protection by literally thousands of refugees .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
