Notes and Comment THE hardy Oriental Ginkgo tree does better in New York than its weaker Western brethren , we are told , and perhaps the Ginkgo will become our civic tree . There should be no protest against this invasion . Better the Ginkgo than no trees at all , and we shall watch its efforts with sympathy . As to the final outcome , we are inclined to smile dubiously , and to wager a small amount that if the Ginkgo tree survives New York , it will be due to sentimental assistance on the part of people , rather than to the hardihood of the tree itself . ICE in a nearby glass tinkles . An electric fan rustles the paper in one 's hand . But one turns the pages over , and one reads advertisements of Fail models from Paris : of fur coats for milady : of Winter topcoats for milord . The times are out of joint !

" ACOVERED Stadium is to be built on the grounds of New York University , and concerts are to be given there next Fall . It is always a delight to see comfort meted out to patrons of the arts , who , being more sensitive than other people , suffer more from minor deficiencies in the routine of living . To enjoy art thoroughly , shocks of the flesh should be minimized .

It is pleasant to note the preservation of the colorful symbol in the Museum on East Eighty-eighth Street ; but even pleasanter is the observation that here and there some shop has the individuality to cling to a happy custom of the past . ATE ARE always sorry to see the name of William M. Bennett creeping into the news . It is a quadrennial reminder of the flight of time . It is a poignant thought that there are New Yorkers who may never live to see more than seven or eight more of Bennett 's races for mayor . OF LATE that astute patriarch , Mr. Brentano , the bibliopolist , under pressure of the Summer season , has so bedecked his windows with blotters , art objects , and movie versions , that it scarcely seems now a bookstore at all .

The Intimate of Fourteenth Street , East , it must be admitted , is staunch in his loyalties , and , consequently , loud in his praises of the Hon. James J. Walker . It 's all fixed for Jimmy over the Bridge , exulted the Intimate of Fourteenth Street , East . Nothing but Walker to the primaries now . It 's this way , he murmured : There 's at least seven district leaders in Brooklyn ready to kick over the traces and they worry McCooey no little . And then , the whisper goes to him that Governor Al is ready to back someone else for leader in Brooklyn if he does n't listen to reason and let Mayor Hylan slide into obscurity . So , what can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , continued the Intimate of Fourteenth Street , East . Right before the primary election , McCooey will come out for Walker . And , in return for this service , Governor Al will let him stay where he is . So it 's all fixed for Jimmy Walker across the Bridge , concluded the Intimate of Fourteenth Street , East .

The Lone Prospector THERE were long stretches when the great sombre house sat limp and still . Somewhere , away in the darkness , an ill-defined area , cinema celebrity-studded , a few score in dinner coats , sitting by dazzling , waved blondes , by sleek raven hair . About and beyond , without limit , the great vestiess , knee-showing hulk , thousands . And lost in the sea , a small grayish man watching his own heart-breaking antics , magnified , thrown forth upon a huge sheet with all the pent up agony of supreme comedy . Then the last close-up , the dull breaking of applause and the little man standing upon the stage . " . ? . an emotional time . . . can only say . . I thank you . . .

Then the house lights and Chaplin THE NEW YORKER himself , the incarnation of The Lone Prospector , standing before the great throng . Yet , in the sudden thunder of relieved hand clapping there seemed to me more pathos than in all the minutes of drama . The picture was a dream , a tugging , lifting dream ; and it was as if the dreamer had awakened with the pie in his hand and never a chance to eat it . Somehow that was not a deifying crowd . The huge pretense of the publicity-instigated , midnight " Gala Opening " stood in glaring relief against the small figure on the stage . Coming curious , almost morbid in the damp heat , the mob had been swayed out of itself in the land of unreality ; but now it was itself again . The avid lust of scandal-monging was in its eyes as it ran forward to see . Life builds up to no climax as of plot . . . while one lives . .

The Lone Prospector . . . from group to group . . . smiling . What price genius ? Prophecy THE next conquest of New York , it is our prediction , will be by the Rent a Car and Drive it Yourself System , the advance guard of which penetrated our barriers only June first and has , it has been announced , already trebled its business . This latest evolution of the automobile industry undertakes to rent all makes of cars , gasoline , oil , and insurance included , at from twelve cents a mile for Fords , to twenty-two cents for six cylinder sedans , and , demanding only ten to fifteen dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest traffic jam . After six p. rn. , when it is expected you will park ( if possible ) in front of some restaurant of the elite , an hourly charge of from twenty-five to thirty-five cents is added and there are special rates for keeping a car more than one day . THE first herald of the new order is the Yellow " Drive-It-Yourself " System , blood relation of the Yellow taxis , so recently absorbed by General Motors . By large placard at Sixty-fourth Street and Broadway , they proclaim " Cars Not Painted Yellow . " Entering , skeptically , to assure myself , I stayed long enough to take out an application ; and in time I may make personal report ... but one may never be sure how one 's references will react . The gentleman at the window was courteous , however . He explained that the system controlled over 2,000 cars in 30o cities , and that while they still have a monopoly in New York it was far from so in other cities . The idea , in short , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in New York expects to make its victory complete . Pop Corn THERE is a rumor that will not down , to the effect that the world will beat a path to the door of the man who makes a better mousetrap than his neighbor , even though he dwell in the depths of the wilderness . Well then , reason totters at the vision of the riches which would come to a man having the sagacity to set up a few hot , buttered pop corn stands in New York . That pop corn should be on sale only at the Grand Central Station , seems little short of a scandal for a city so rich in other opportunities . CONFIDENCE VARIANT , No. kJ 3,827 : Genial and Pompous Gentleman enters architect 's office , asking audience with the chief . Granted , almost instantly . For two hours , approximately , thereafter , the G. and P. G. has the architect poring over a set of plans , recommending changes in and additions to the Long Island estate just purchased  --  so he says  --  by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Genial , etc. , mentions very casually that he is about to claim six cases of champagne brought in by a purser with whom he made an arrangement . And very reasonable , too . Sixty dollars a case . And , oh  --  afterthought  --  if Mr. Architect would care to have three cases ? ! Surely Mr. Architect would . Well , then , just send your man along to meet mine , and have him bring his one hundred and eighty dollars ( there seems to he no suspicion about any bootleg transaction proposed ) and the three cases are yours . And very generous of you , sir , says the architect , always glad to humor a client , and besides such a commission as that just obtained is worthy of celebration . So , the architect 's man meets the man of the G. and P. G. , and in a taxi they depart for a building in the shipping district . One moment , says the latter , on arrival . I will go in and pay and we 'll go aboard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me have the hundred and eighty ? My boss only gave me two hundred . Said you 'd have the rest . All right , then . Just sit here and wait a minute . So the architect loses not only the one hundred and eighty dollars , but also what time his trustful employee spends waiting for the champagne to be brought to his taxi . Jazz IASCHA HEIFETZ , I had long known , dabbles in jazz as an amusement ; but it was only lately , in the course of chats with the music critics , that I learned Paderewski and Godowsky , among other artists , have the same hobby . So jazz , successor to the outcast ragtime , each day is becoming more acceptable . It is the young brother of the musical family , irresponsible and at times highly irritating , but , nevertheless , acknowledged . And the writers of jazz are no longer those products of East Side dives who remained , with notable exceptions , faithful to the ideals and tastes peculiar to their early surroundings . Mr. Buddy de Sylva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , is a collector of first editions in his non-working hours , which represents a great advance over the hobbies current in the ragtime age . Mr. Irving Caesar , another eminent in jazz , is an authority on symphonic music . Mr. Zez Con frey , originator of " Kitten on the Keys , " is now writing rather serious works for piano . As for Mr. George Gershwin , high priest of jazz , he is laboring on a concerto for Dr. Damrosch , while other symphony conductors are besieging him for copies of his " Symphony in Blue . " This , by the way , is one of the few phonograph records surviving profitably against the radio invasion . It is to Mr. Gershwin 's adventure , THE NEW YORKER what time he appeared on the stage of Aeolian Hall to play accompaniments for Mme. Eva Gauthier , that the change in the temper of the popular song writers may be traced . The incident lent dignity to jazz . Yet , Mr. Gershwin had his doubts . Before he consented to play for Mme. Gauthier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it ? ? Or do you think it will hurt me ? " Exit Graustark Brightness falls from the air , Queens have died young and fair , Dust bath closed Helen 's eyes v ES , and Madison Square is n't 1 what it used to be , the Vanderbilt and Astor houses arc coming down , and now the Fifth Avenue dining room of the St. Regis is to be done away with in order that its space may be occupied by shops . This last is bad news for many of us who found in that room a Je-nesais-pas-quoi which set it apart from everything else of its kind in New York . It had a certain Graustarkian splendor which managed , somehow , to be more impressive than rococo , and the beau monde feeling which came from glimpsing the passing show on the Avenue made it almost worth while to pay a dollar and something for two or three spears of aspargus . But the room 's real charm lay , proba. bly , in the fact that it never looked local . Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woods , Mr. Cyril Maude or Miss Elsie Ferguson might occasionally be singled out , the majority of the patrons looked as if they were here temporarily on mysterious and important affairs , with dispatch boxes in the hotel safe and rich cargoes of vegetable and mineral treasures on the seas . There was an international aspect to the scene . We never entered it without feeling as if we had stepped right into the pages of an E. Phillips Oppenheim novel . Dog Days AUGUST . . . dog days . The AUGUS drone of electric fans holds little promise of cooler and less languorous days to come . In the lull before dinner time , embryo heroes of the diamond gather in Washington Square or the side streets , to play a hybrid game of pitching a soft rubber ball for " runs , " whilst the cop , turning his back , pictures the sweet content of confronting a tall glass of beer . Sales are slow along West Fifty-seventh Street . Florists on the Avenue draw blinds to prevent the hot rays of a late sun from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Block upon block in the East Sixties and Seventies , barricaded doors , boarded windows , tiny , gray crests of private police , warning of tangled wires awaiting the intruder who would venture within . Block upon block , still-hot , echoing dully to the slow tread of the passing patrolman , seeking the cool of the caretaker 's cellar . Owners lie limp in club windows , happily locked from their dust-cloth covered tombs , resting between week-ends . Why wander midst haunted emptiness ? Below the square is the place to dine . Between the high wooden walls , hiding higher stone walls , Tony presides over tables for eighty , and only a subdued fraction of that number present . Tony takes our order for red wine which we know will be very , very ordinaire , and so needs ice . Years ago we learned that in Europe . So did Tony . " A little ice , Tony , " we ask . " just as you wish , but for myself ? " and a shrug of the shoulders , " for myself the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Tepid dog days . The omnipresent drone of weary traffic . Thank God the family is out of town , A Step Forward WE accept European backward- ness , and even the best of us are inclined to glory in our forwardness ; especially when we realize that only now is England building her first hotel with a bath for every room . And here our own Waldorf could never have come right out and competed with most any of our most recent hotels ( had it been so minded ) by advertising in good , round , lusty , American numbers , " 1,000 Rooms  --  t , 000 Baths . " No , for it is disclosed that only now the Waldorf , along with remodelling its ground floor to accommodate shops , is adding 125 bathrooms . Then there will he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars , this is costing , or $4,000 a bath . This may seem preposterously expensive , but the installation of baths means changing doorways to preserve symmetry , revising closet space , moving the cut glass chandeliers to the new centre of the rooms , and all such . These alterations mean , of course , that the Waldorf will continue to be the Waldorf . Wanamakers will not move up town to take possession , because of the death of Mr. Wanamaker and the plans for new bridges and subways . And Peacock Alley will be twelve feet wider , and will be ornamented by new golden peacocks as reminders of its glories of a generation and a half . Verboten F THE newspapers are lucky , there 1 will soon be a trial of a three-year-old boy in Long Branch on the charge of obscenity .

He took the little boy by the hand and led him to a post on which was a large placard . " There ! " he said . The sign read : " No CURSING OR SMOKING ALLOWED . " So far , on the advice of his male parent , the tot has refused to apologize , but has offered to shoot dice with The manager for his bathhouse , or the beach , or any side stakes at all .

Bequeath the collection to the New York Public Library , to he sealed for one hundred years , and then to be available to students and historians . They might find it highly illuminating . " But in one hundred years , " protested Mr. David H. Wallace , " what is risque to-day will be valuable as a source of material only to writers of nursery rhymes .
