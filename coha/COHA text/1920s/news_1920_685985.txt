txt The trouble with the American International Corporation is not in its $30,000,000 investments . It is in international exchange rates which hold up collections from its customers in South America . January 1 last the company had in its export department $15,000,000 of merchandize which has since been reduced and $25,000,000 of accounts and bills receivable which have since been increased . Losses here have not yet been realized and the company 's officials see no reason to anticipate them . It is , they say , all a matter of time in collections . South America has been accustomed to long credits and does not relish paying promptly at 30% premium for American money . We are now getting our first lessons in international trade finance to which our short term credits , high percentage of gold reserves and new acceptance markets are not yet fully adapted . The United States Government in its treasury borrowings is also stressing the bank discount or acceptance market and crowding out credits for international trade . Our shipping facilities have been bungled at Washington in the attempted establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house of G. Amsinck St Co. has been in South American trade for 70 years and its losses have averaged but a fraction of 1% . When the International Corporation took it over from the United States Government for $4.000.000 it also added $4.000,000 more to that concern 's capital and enlarged its export trade . The business is believed to be sound but it is now under frozen credits . The customers of this concern have not failed and have no intention of failing . But unless the United States is ta surrender this trade , credits must be extended , our home acceptance market must be expanded and time must be given these countries to pay , not in more gold which they have not , but in goods which they have and which they naturally produce . We must atop - crowding exports upon them and must extend credit to help their natural exports to us . When the American International Corporation was organized with its 850,000,000 capital , since fully paid in. it was hailed as a corporation to follow international investments , shipping and export interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has them intact , and therein will be its future .
