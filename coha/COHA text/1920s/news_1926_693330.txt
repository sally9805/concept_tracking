txt Sam Browne Belts for Policemen . Is the New York policeman getting a fair chance against the bandits he is called upon to combat ? It Is only common sense to give tile policeman a chance to defend himself , and today . with the bandit so " quick on the trigger , " the policeman hardly has that . His revolver la in his hip pocket or in a holster on his belt  --  a fairly  --  Thaccessible place in Summer and very inaccessible In Winter ? when he wears his long overcoat . Many other cities give their , policemen at least a fighting chance , permitting them to wear revolvers on Sam Browne bells . The State police wear It that Way also . The two policemen who were killed In Brooklyn might have been spared if they had had their hands on their guns instead of on their night sticks when they stopped the automdbile containing the four gunmen . Why not change the New York police equipment ? HOWARD L. AUERBACH . New York , Nov. 30 , 192d.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
