Pennies pinched by Scotch employers since the War have turned many a braw Sandy and honest Wully to Communism . Scotland 's shipyards on the Clyde and Scotland 's dreary coal mines are the new cradle of British Reds . Last week the British Coal Miners ' Federation Conference met at Llandudno , Wales , and was bearded by five Scotch Reds , executives of the Scotch Communist Miners ' Union , which was recently expelled from the parent Federation . " Tyrant ! " bawled the Scots at Federation President Herbert Smith , 65 , " we demand a hearing ! " <P> Steadfastly ignored at first by President Smith , the malcontents ascended to a gallery , where they stamped , catcalled and finally picked a fist fight which made proceedings impossible . Roused , " Old Herbie " Smith dashed from platform to gallery , shouting , " I 'm 65 , but to one of the Reds I 'll throw you out , Bill Allen ! " <P> While onlookers throated hoarse glee , " Old Herbie " did throw " Bill " out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Smith was about to descend from the balcony when a Welsh Communist , Arthur Horner , onetime amateur lightweight boxing champion of South Wales , rushed up the aisle belligerently shouting , " I 'm in on this fight ! " <P> " You 're out , Art Horner ! " roared the President , then leaped down six balcony steps , stunned Communist Horner with the impact of heavy boots , did not quite kill him , restored complete order . <P> Observers marked as significant that famed A. J. " Emperor " Cook , firebrand Secretary of the Miners ' Federation , and perhaps one of the chief provokers of the British General Strike ( TIME , May 17 , 1926 ) , is now so chastened by the failure of his 100% Red projects that last week he assisted President Smith with the ejections.
