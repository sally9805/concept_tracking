txt Great interest was aroused in England by the recent publication of the report of the Industrial Transference Board . Composed of three able and impartial members , it was directed to study mainly the possibilities of " transfer of workers , and in " particular miners , for whom op " portunities of employment in their " own district or occupation are no " longer available . " This at once raises the question of the mobility of British labor . It has long been regarded as much below that of American . Rapid shifts from one job to another have been much more common in this country than in England . There , it is concluded by the Industrial Board , a great deal of organized and governmental aid will have to supplement the voluntary action of men out of work . The great and troublesome " surplus " of labor is found in British coal mining . Taking into account the ups and downs of that industry for the past year and a half , the report estimates that there are 200,000 more miners than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this surplusage is the chief problem . Among these unemployed miners , about 30,000 are under the age of 25 . The report proposes that several training schools for these young men be added to those in existence in order to teach them how to engage in some other occupation . To do something for this juvenile element is considered of the utmost importance , since idleness works a sure and swift demoralization . As the report says : " To loaf for one , two , " three or more years destroys the " will to work . " Many of the older miners can not be expected to show much adaptability to new occupations . But those in middle life and the younger men have , it is believed , a marked " transfer value , " as laborers . Many plans . and . devices are urged in the report in order to relieve the pressure in coal mining regions , and to furnish useful workers in other industries . Changes have been taking place in the heavy industries . Some of them are not so concentrated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have many new factories , with specialized products , been opened in recent years . It is hoped that English industry will continue to display this kind of mobility . But even when all has been done that can be done on English soil , such as settling families of unemployed on small holdings by the aid of Government funds , the report emphasizes the fact that the chief hope of permanent relief must lie in emigration . This is not a question of dumping great numbers of the unemployable upon the Dominions . There must ? be careful selection of men who have skill and energy sut. ficient to make sure that they car stand on their own feet in a nevi country , after the British Govern . ment has helped them to get there This work of sifting would-be emigrants has been carefully attendee to by Government agencies . The discouraging thing is that , according to the report , " there are many more " people applying and ready to apply " for assisted passages overseas that " the Dominions are prepared to " accept . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia . Yet the Industrial Board continues to urge " stimulates migration " as a necessary supple . ment to the natural efforts of un ? employed British workmen to fint occupations and homes somewhere within the empire .
