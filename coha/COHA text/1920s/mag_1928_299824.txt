Only once has a Fascist mob lynched an assailant of Signor Benito Mussolini . The single instance occurred at Bologna ( TIME , Nov. 8 , 1926 ) . There the Dictator sat implacable and silent , in his limousine , after a bullet had ripped through his sash of the Grand Cordon of the Order of St. Maurice and St. Lazarus , barely skirting the abdomen . <P> The mob , interpreting Il Duce 's silence as a command , put 14 stiletto strokes into the assailant , one Anteo Zamboni , and pummeled his remains into a pulp . <P> Since then Law has been slowly enlarging the circumference of Signor Mussolini 's vengeance . Last week the father and mother of Lynchee Zamboni were sentenced at Rome to 30 years in Jail as instigators and accomplices . <P> Father Momolo Zamboni vigorously denied all guilt , but produced a very bad effect upon the Court by remarking with candor and simplicity : " We are Anarchical Communists . Anarchical because we do not want any government . Where there is government there is authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty which we desire . We are Communists because we wish that everything which exists or which is produced be shared by everybody . " <P> Counsel for the defense submitted that his clients were not really " Anarchical Communists " but just " idealistic anarchists . " <P> The vast difference between an " anarchical communist " and an " idealistic anarchist " is , of course , that between a resolute , active borer from within Society , and a dreamy yearner after millennium . But the Court , a military tribunal , seemed unimpressed by even so glaring a disparity .
