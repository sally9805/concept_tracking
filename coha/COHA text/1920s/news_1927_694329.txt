txt The Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation will fight the transit readjustment plan proposed by Samuel Untermyer , special counsel of the Transit Commission , all along the line . This was indicated clearly yesterday , although neither former Governor Nathan L. Miller nor A. al Williams . of counsel for the B. M. T. nor Gerhard M. Dahl , Chairman of its Board of Directors , would comment directly on the plan without further opportunity for study . As outlined by a representative of the company , the B. M. T. will fight the recapture by the city of its subway system . as proposed by Mr. Untermyer , and will contend in court that the city can not recapture until ten years after the completion of the Nassau Street subway , construction of which has not yet been started , on the ground that its contract with the city gives it trackage rights which the city can not furnish until the Narenu Street subway is built . The B. N. T. also will oppose condemnation of its Sea Beach and Brighton elevated lines on the ground that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for condemnation , which Mr. Untermyer has suggested . Although ea-Governor Miller will continue as chief B. M. T. counsel , it is expected that Mr. Williams will be in charge of the details of the prospective litigation . To Appeal to Public . The officers of the company also intend to appeal to popular sentiment , particularly in Brooklyn . against recapture of the B. M. T. subway system , which they assert would result in a disruption of the present Brooklyn rapid transit service and leave many sections without transportation to midtown or uptown Manhattan without payment of an additional fare . " The Untermyer plan is not one of unification , " said a B. M. T. representative . " It is one of disintegration . " Another argument which spokesMen of the B. T. intend to use in an appeal for popular support against the plan is that the city can not find the $196.690,000 needed for the recapture plan . The policy of the officers of the Interborough , with whom Mr. Untermyer has been negotiating for the purchase of the Interborough and Manhattan elevated properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. Quackenbush , general counsel of the Interborough , said he did not care to discuss Mr. Untermyer 's report . Approves Report in Principle . John H. Delaney , chairman of the Board of Transportation , who is Mayor Walker 's chief adviser on transit matters , approved the linterrayer report in principle , but said that there undoubtedly would he changes in minor details , as the plan suggested by Mr. Untermyer in his report was only tentative . ' The three big points about the plan are these , " Mr. Delaney said in the presence of Daniel L. Ryan and Frank X. Sullivan , the other members of the board , who gave general acquiescence to his views : " It preserves the five-cent fare , it assures public control and it eliminates stock speculation . The entire Board of Transportation is heartily in accord with the report in principle . " " The city has not money enough ' within its debt limit right now to pay $196.000.000 for recapture , " Mr. Delaney replied to a question , " hut it will take a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into effect . " If the city decides to put the money into recapture of the lines , this will affect the debt limit only temporarily . The entire investment which private capital now has in the lines which it is sought to recapture is self-supporting . Ths returns which the railroads are securing are sufficient to carry the investments by the companies . We would be changing the form merely and it would throw no additional burden on the city . " We know that the B. N. T. subway system is showing a profit to the company . So far as the Interborough is concerned , the earnings of its east side and west side subway lines are all thrown into one pot at present . /f we decide to recapture the Interborough east side subway it would take a year to allocate the earnings of that system before we could go to the court to have the city 's investment in that line exempted from the debt limit and demonstrate what its earnings were . " I am pretty well satisfied with the whole idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation a year ago in an address before the Municipal Club of Brook- 13-n . It is very gratifying to find that Mr. Untermyer has found a way out and has reached a solution without municipal operation . " " What has become of the idea of municipal operation ? " Mr. Delaney was asked . " We are not so much concerned With municipal operation , " he replied , " as . we are with getting away from private exploitation . " Doubts Civic Control Proposal . Mr. Ryan , who had followed Mr. Delaney 's remarks closely , showed a doubt about nomination of directors of the proposed Board of Transit Control by a number of civic organizations " I ata in favor of Mr. Delaney 's suggestion of a year ago for an outside Board of Control , " Mr. Ryan said , " but I am not committed to the make-up of the proposed board . " Acting Mayor Joseph V. would not comment on the plan on the ground that he would have to vote on it as a member of the Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller , Borough President of Manhattan . There were indications , however , that there might be considerable opposition in the board to the proposal to give control of the proposed new transit system to the nominees of civic organizations . At the offices of the Merchants ' Association it was said that its Transit Committee would not comment on this phase of the plan until the report of Charles Edward Smith , St. Louis engineer , who is preparing a transit plan for Controller Berry , was out . It would then consider the two plans together . The Transit Committee of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce , of which Frederick L. Cranford is Chairman , will study the Untermyer plan before deciding whether or not it wishes to participate in it to the extent of making a nomination for the Board of Control . A similar position was taken by representatives of the other organizations named as nominators . Plea for Other Civic Bodies . James W. Danahy , Managing Director of the Eighth Avenue Association , wrote Mr. Untermyer suggesting that , while distinctively borough ' organizations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors , this privilege had not been accorded to Manhattan , because both the Merchants ' Association and the Real Estate Board were city-ttide organizations and not distinctively Manhattan organizations at all .

Broadway Association , Central Mercantile Association , Central Park West and Columbus Avenue Association , Eighth Avenue Association , Fifth Avenue Association , First Avenue Association , Forty-second Street Property Owners ' and Merchants ' Association , Harlem Board of Commerce , Sixth Avenue Association , Thirty-fourth Street Midtown Association and Washington Heights Chamber of Commerce . Controller Berry was not at his office yesterday . It was said there that Mr. Smith 's report probably would be ready in about two weeks . The Controller 's attitude toward the Untermyer plan is expected to be skeptical , if he is not actually opposed to it . The Controller , it was said , was interested as the chief financial officer of the city to know where Mr. Untermyer would propose to get the $196,000,000 needed for recapture .

" I went to the offices of the Transit Corn mission to get a copy of the . plan but was told that there was none available , " Mr .. Hylan said .
