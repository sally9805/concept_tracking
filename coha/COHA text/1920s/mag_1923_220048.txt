This is the introductory paragraph of a New York Tribune editorial : " If passengers were sailing under a captain who announced the opinion that icebergs were good for a ship , and who thereupon steered his vessel for the nearest berg , what would they do ? Would they argue that the important thing was to teach him a jolly good lesson-give the old man rope to hang himself , and so on , and let the ship drive on ? Or would they do everything in their power to block him and incidentally save the ship ? " Mayor Hylan is the captain . And New York City the ship .
