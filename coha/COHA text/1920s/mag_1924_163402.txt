A pronouncement last week from two neurosurgeons of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital , Philadelphia , stated that the pain , if not the doom of cancer , can be mitigated by an operation . The surgeons are William G. Spiller and Charles H. Frazier . Their operation-chordotomy- severs the sensory nerves in the spinal column . It is performed in cases where the pain is too great for drugs to relieve . <P> Drs . Spiller and Frazier published the results of eight operations , of which six successfully ended pain . In two cases , some pain fibres escaped the knife . Said Surgeon Spiller : " It requires on the part of the operator a visualization of the microscopic anatomy of the cord and a realization that a slight misplacement of the incision may cause motor-paralysis of one or both of the lower limbs . "
