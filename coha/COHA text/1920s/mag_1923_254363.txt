At an exhibit of the Society of Independent Artists in Manhattan , appeared a canvas entitled , " The Marriage at Cana of Galilee " . It represented the biblical incident of the changing of water into wine , but with the introduction of unmistakable likenesses of Mr. Volstead , Mr. Bryan and Mr. Anderson . Mr. Bryan poured the miraculously made wine onto the floor , and under the painting was the inscription : " Father , forgive them for they know not what they do . "
