txt The following letter written by a careful student of the securities markets , resident in another city , may be of interest to investors in generaL It was addressed to an executive of one of the leading banks in New York : " I do not expect the bond market to do much this summer . An excellent thing is being done at the present time in dissolving syndicates where the bonds are over-priced . In this rich country there is such a ' back-log ' of funds constantly seeking investment that I do not see how the bond market can slump very much if given a fair chance . I do not think dealers have given it a fair chance the last three months . " The big mistake a great many of the economic services and other experts have been making on the stock market and will continue to make is that they are constantly looking for a big , broad bear market whereas we are having a selectively bullish market and a selectively bearish market all the time- There is so much money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival of the fittest ' and one can make money by buying stocks of the best managed companies in sound industries and at the same time selling the weaker units in the industry . " In the rich creditor nations of Europe , prior to 1914 , they used to have long eras of prosperity running 20 to 30 years . I am inclined to believe that we are in for an era of selective prosperity where the best managed cornpanics in sound industries will go far ahead and owners of securities in these companies will also be happy with the results . The sharp valleys and peaks business had prior to the war and the Federal Reserve banking system I think are gone forever in this country . " Chesapeake Corp . 5s , 1947 , have been steadily working upward since attention was drawn to them in The Wall Street Journal about three weeks ago . They were then selling at 95 whereas they are now having a ready market at 96 to 96% . Considered either as a 20-year bond or a five-year security , the bonds at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respective bases of 5. - WC : - and 6.2051 , . The gain of one point in price has brought the yield on the short term basis , which assumes that the bonds will be called at par before they become convertible in 1932 , to less than 5.95% while for a 20-year period it has declined only slightly to about 5.32% . Whatever sharpshooting these bonds have hnd to face at the hands of those seeking to take advantage of the congestion in the market seems to have been met without difficulty .
