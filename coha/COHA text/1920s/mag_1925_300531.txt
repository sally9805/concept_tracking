B. C. Forbes , onetime Scotch printers devil , now editor of the financial bi-weekly which bears his name , penned many a hard word anent the late tobacco millionaire , James B. Duke , and published them in his latest issue a fortnight ago . <P> Mr. Forbes declared : <P> " Nearly every outstanding American business leader , no matter how little schooling he may have had originally , manages to become respectably well educated . Duke palpably failed to do so . . . . <P> " One constantly had the feeling while in Duke 's presence , that he was an unhappy , disgruntled , soured mortal . . . . <P> " He could not ' bear to be crossed or criticized . When he cracked the whip everybody must jump . ' . . . <P> " He died an unhappy , dissatisfied mortal , super-abundantly rich in millions but bankrupt in friends . He was so engrossed in battling fiercely for money that he took no time to acquire education and nursed such a nature that he became incapable of attracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native state , newspapers were full of condemnation of alleged tactics on his part to relieve him of certain taxes . His own people apparently regarded him in the same light as he was regarded in the financial and business world . " <P> Editor Forbes then went on to say that during his first interview with the millionaire tobacconist , Mr. Duke lit four or five cigars in the course of the afternoon , without ever offering one to his guest . On another occasion Mr. Duke canceled his subscription to Forbes Magazine , because it had carried an attack upon certain of Duke 's speculative operations . <P> Having weighed well the fiscal achievements of tobacconist Duke and added in the University which he founded with an endowment of $30,000,000 , Scotsman Forbes summed up Mr. Duke 's contribution to the world as follows : " His life yielded him little satisfaction and he was , in my judgment , a failure .
