txt The office of Emory H. Buckner , United States District Attorney for the Southern Judicial District of , New York . has undertaken an Investigation of the charges implied by Senator J. Thomas Heflin of Alabama in a speech in the Senate Thursday when he intimated that Jess W. Smith , right-hand Man of former Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty , whose body was found in Mr. Daugherty 's apartment at the Wardman Park Hotel in Washington on Decoration Day , 1922 , did not commit suicide , but was murdered . Senator Heflin said today that he had received ' a telephone call this nlOrning from some one in the Department of Justice , asking him if he would'ieceive a ' lett &; iir 6ehitlf of D18u trict Attorney Ruckner 's office , re questing a statement of what he knew with reference to the allegations implied by his speech . He said he replied that he . would ' receive the letter and would . furnish the information . It is understood that Senator Heflin will no ' maintain that he has any positive information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide , but that he based his statements to the Senate on reports circulated since the death of Smith . e Reasons Advanced for Inquiry . While information is not available as to the purpose of District Attorney Buckner 's office iii seeking information from Senator Heflin , the belief prevails here tnat the intention is to make Mr. Heflin show whether he had any substantial foundation for his implications . These implications ' were coupled with an insinuation that a disagreement of the jury was assured in advance of the recent trial of Mr. Daugherty 1111 the Federal District Court in New York City on the charge of conspiracy to defraud the Government in ethe return of property seized by the Alien Property Custodian , Colonel Thomas W. Miller , who was tried with Mr. Daugherty . The jury failed to agree . One suggestion advanced is that the Federal District Attorney 's office in New Yo'k is investigating what lies behind the implication of the Heflin speech with a view to learning whether it will lead to information that might be used in future trials growing out of alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Jesse Smith died in Mr. Daugherty 's apartment the Attorney General was the guest of President and Mrs. Harding at the White House . He was ill at the time'and Mr. and Mrs. Hard-1 ing had taken him to the White House ' in the belief that he would receive better medical treatment there . The only person in the Daugherty apartment when the tragedy occurred was the private secretary of the Attorney General . He heard the fall of a heavy object and going to investigate found the body of Smith with an automatic pistol near It . Rumors Concerning Smith . A gaping wound in Smith 's head was the evident cause of his death and a certificate of suicide was given . Sena-1 tor Burton K. Wheeler of Montana , who conducted the senate investigation into the conduct of the Department of Justice while Mr. Daugherty was Attorney General , said ' today that it was his information that no inquest was held . At the time of Smith 's death rumors were In circulation that he had been engaged in questionable operations in the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial proceedings accusations Were made that he was involved in extensive grafting operations , including acceptance of money for permitting the shipment of the Dempsey-Carpentier prize fight films out of New Jersey in violation of a Federal law and for obtaining the illegal withdrawal of intoxicating liquor from Government bonded warehouses . There was always considerable mystery in regard to Jesse Smith 's status In the Department of Justice . He held no official position , but had desk room in the department building while Mr. Daugherty was Attorney General and was very active about the department . He was the owner of a small department store in Washington Court House , 0. , and an ardent admirer a Mr. Daugherty to whom he served as an assistant in the Harding Presidential campaign in 1920 . He came to Washington just before President Harding 's inauguration in March , 1921 , and was designated as secretary of the Committee of Wash , ington citizens organized to make preparations for the inauguration . It was supposed at the time that he was the personal representative of Mr. Harding . but there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed himself to Mrs. Harding as perturbed when he read in newspapers after the inauguration that Attorney General Daugherty had installed Smith in the Department of Justice . Circumstances Indicate Suicide . Smith was said to have been suffering from diabetes at the time of his death and as not having fully recovered from an ? operation for appendicitis . All the circumstances of his death indicated suicide . While Senator Heflin said in the Senate on Thursday that the bullet had been fired into the back of Smith 's head and that there were no powder burns or marks to indicate . that the shot came from close quarters the information given out at the time of his death was that Smith had been shot through the forehead . Assuming that Smith did commit suicide , there has been much speculation in Washington as to what induced the act . At first it was attributed to ill-health . Subsequently , when proceedings before the Senate Investigating Committee and a large amount of gossip were construed by many as implicating Smith in grafting operations , various theories other than that based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Believed to Have Feared Exposure . The outstanding feature of Smith 's character , as Washington saw it , was his devotion to Mr. Daugherty . A man of full habit who greatly enjoyed the good things of life and apparently was possessed of a happy disposition , those who knew Jess Smith were of the opinion that only some mental cataclysm could have caused him to kill himself . After the Senate investigation a rather widespread opinion prevailed that he was confronted with exposure of his alleged grafting operations and committed suicide either to escape possible punishment or to avoid the mental anguish and ignominy of being cast off by his close friends . Through his intimacy with Attorney General Daugherty he had been invited to society functions and had met people of high social position . Newspaper dispatches from Washington Court House in telling that Jess Smith 's will had been filed there said that surprise was expressed at the size of his estate , the value of which was estimated at $200.000 . A will made by him a year before his death left 525.000 each to Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a banker of Washington Court House , and Miss Roxie Stinson , divorced wife of Smith . Miss Stinson.wad one . of the fitaZ witnesses against Mr. Daugherty in the Senate investigation . She was subpoenaed as a witness for the Government in the recent trial of Mr. Daugherty and Colonel Miller in New York , but was not called to the stand . Igo Inquest , Says Senator Wheeler . A will scribbled by Smith just before his death and found in his room in Attorney General Daugherty 's apartment , was not probated because it had not been witnessed . When informed today of the action of the United States District Attorney 's office in New York , Senator Wheeler said : " I received no direct or positive evidence that Jess Smith was killed in Daugherty 's apartment . There was some circumstantial evidence which would seem to indicate that he had not committed suicide , such , for instance , as the position that his body was found in , and the fact that he was always afraid of firearms . It is a well-known fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by means of anything which they fear or by a method which they abhor . " My information was that no inquest was even held over Jess Smith 's body and , as 1 recall now , Jess Smith 's former wife was not permitted to see him When she tried to do so . " It is true , as Senator Heflin said , that Smith had been extremely afraid that some one would ' get ' him and had so expressed himself on numerous occasions to different people . " The foregoing were , in substance , the principal circumstances which tended to raise a doubt in my mind as to the method in which Jess Smith came to his death , but we were unable to go very deeply into it for the reason that . the death occurred some time prior to the convening of the committee . We were able to get only meager and rather unreliable reports concerning the circumstances surrounding the same . " No Comment from Buckner . Mr. Buckner , who &returned; to his home , 130 East Sixty-third Street , yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , following an operation for mastoiditis , declined last night to comment on the request made-by his office on Senator Heflin . Littleton Criticizes Heflin . Martin W. Littleton , speaking last night at the annual dinner of the New York County Lawyers ' Association at the Biltmore , . attacked Senator Heflin for his speech in the Senate , alleging that the jurors in the Fall-Doheny trial had been guilty of improprieties . " Only the other day , " said Mr. Littleton , " a Senator of the United States arose in his place  --  he should thank God that he had the privilege of the ' ' Senate floor to protect him against i libel  --  and denounced a Justice of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia and denounced a jury . We have heard things like this of late from irresponsible people and demagogues . If the administration of justice in this country Is to be protected there must be some voices raised against the 11 ?
