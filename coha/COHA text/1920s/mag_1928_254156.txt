Enough to set hairs a-standing on pious Mohammedan heads would be a proposal to cover the broad , flat floors of mosques with hateful , heathen pews . <P> Pews would prevent squatting in the traditional attitude of prayer . Pews would obstruct reverent foreheads from bending down to touch the floor of the House of Allah . Pews would be an awful desecration - as awful as though heathen Christians should not don slippers before entering a mosque , and thus pollute the floor . <P> However , since the present ruling class of Young Turks are not pious Mohammedans , it was natural , last week , that the Commission on Religious Reform , recently appointed by President Mustafa Kemal Pasha should recommend : 1 ) Pews to cover the floor of every mosque ; 2 ) abolition of the mosque slipper and prayer rug ; 3 ) installation of organs , choirs . <P> Observers of the Young Turks ' successful occidentalization of Turkey marveled , once more , at the docility of the Turkish masses , which have abandoned the fez , ceased to contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental rites of their religion-all this within ten years .
