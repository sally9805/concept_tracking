txt It is stated in official quarters in Paris that England and . France have reached an agreement to follow an identical policy in respect of Secretary Kellogg 's proposed treaty outlawing war . It is further reported that this position , which comes as a result of the visit of Lord Crewes , the British Ambassador , to Foreign Minister Briand yesterday , means that Paris and London will take the same attitude toward development of the treaty , not only because they are closely associated in their foreign policies but because they are the two leading members of the League of Nations . This means that if a treaty is made with either it must be made with both , which naturally is entirely in accord with Mr. Kellogg 's ideas . But it may further mean that both will put forward reservations or constructions either may favor . Furthermore , the significance of the Franco-British agreement is that in the last analysis the American treaty would find a rather united League front against any suggested feature which might be construed as threatening the Geneva organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner in which the American reservations to the World Court were handled . The American State Department insisted on dealing individually with each nation adhering to The Hague tribunal . Technically , the State Department had its way , but in reality the American reservations were rejected at a meeting at Geneva coincident with the Assembly gathering . Uninterestingly enough , it was the English who took the firmest stand against certain American conditions . Separate nations sent individual replies to Washington , but the replies were all shaped after the Geneva decision . This does not necessarily mean that England will try to handle Mr. Kellogg 's treaty in the same way . There is no apparent reason to predict that . One may only point out a possible analogy . It is often said in Paris that Stephane Lauzanne , the editor of the Matin , is more American than any American . Generally , M. Lauzanne finds that anything American is better than its counterpart anywhere else . But he makes an exception for Mr. Kellogg 's proposed treaty in an article in the Matin , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Franco-American negotiations for a compact outlawing war ? If you are , please do not read these lines written by one whose enthusiasm is glacial . " It was Aristide Briand who last April had the idea of proposing to the United States a compact forever banning war between the two countries . One might praise or condemn such a proposal , but one could not deny its novelty . M. Briand had an original idea . He is entitled to a sort of copyright on it . America could ? take it or leave it . But it seemed impossible according to all rules that she could deform it or appropriate it for her personal profit . Alas ! That is just what ' the Hon. Frank B , Kellogg , - Secretary of State , has done . Why It Was Offered to America ? Alone . " M. Briand offered his compact to the United States alone . Why ? The answer is easy . First , because the United States did not belong to the Geneva organization and ? secondly , because France already was engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the League of Nations .. " There was nothing to prevent America , ' after making a compact with ' France , making a similar corn- pact with other nations . But Washington 's way of acting is as if you were to invite a good friend to take a little intimate excursion with you and the friend were to say , ' Charming idea , but ask Tom , Dick and Harry to come along . ' That is just what the Hon. Frank B. Kellogg has done . He finds M. Briand 's idea lovely if others find it lovely , too . When it comes to perpetual peace , Mr. Kellogg believes in mass production . " What reason led the Secretary of State to enlarge M. Briand 's invitation to include every one in the world ? I believe this reason was simple ? it was a matter of finding a counterpart to the League of Nations , which America brought into the world and then for reasons of domestic politics abandoned . It was a question of substituting the compact of Washington for the compact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying to the Democrats in election year : " ' We Republicans have done better than Wilson . Without assuming any responsibility , without engaging in any sort of machinery , we have concluded with all countries a world compact of perpetual peace banning war forever . ' " For America , which has some admirable qualities , has one terrible fault . She has no national foreign policy . Her foreign policy varies according to the parties in power and according to the needs of these parties for election purposes . With the Republicans the main consideration is knock out the Democrats and with the Democrats the main idea is to make the Republican elephant groggy . War , peace , finances , commerce . world concord , tariff discord ? all that serves as a football in the game the parties play every four years . " With disarming ingenuousness Americans say , ' Do n't talk about debts , this year we have a Senatorial election , ' or ' Do n't talk about the League of Nations , next year we have a Presidential election , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " Aq a matter of fact . no doubt M. Briand 's proposal was never considered on its merits as establishing peace between America and France , but on its merits as a plank in the platform of the party in power . And Inasmuch as M. Briand 's proposal offered nothing seductive for 20,000 , - 000 German voters , 10,000,000 Italian voters and 8,000,000 Irish voters , Washington transformed a little car for two into an autobus with a place for every one . " Moral  --  When one submits a diplomatic proposal to the State Department one ought to look first at the calendar and if it is an election year one had better do nothing . " Another moral  --  When one offers America an instrument of peace it is better not to present an individual model , but a mechanical model fit for mass production . The products of the State Department , like those of the steel department , are manufactured only in series . " ARBITRATION TREATY HITCH . Washington Officials Say One French Suggestion Is Unacceptable . Special to The Yew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the latest Briand proposals in connection with the renewal of the Root Arbitration Treaty , which expires Feb. 27 , has led to definite opinions among State Department officials that one of the French suggestions can not be accepted . This suggestion is that if the two nations are unable to reach an understanding on a basis for arbitrating any particular dispute , the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague be authorized to define the terms in accordance with Articles 53 and 54 of The Hague Convention of 1907 for the Pacific Settlement of Disputes . Officials recalled today that when The Hague Convention was ratified by the Senate , it refused to agree to these two articles . They have no idea that the Senate will reverse itself . A second suggestion made by France was that the Arbitration Treaty omit such questions as might conflict with the duties of France as a member of the League of Nations . This will require detailed study before the American position can be defined , but present expectation is that an accommodation in this respect can be arrived at . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the foregoing dispatch , the Permanent Court is competent to settle any compromise if the parties interested agree to have recourse to it . A dispute covered by a subsequent treaty may be appealed to the court by one of the interested parties , or a dispute arising from international debts claimed by one when all parties have accepted arbitration . According to Article 54 in the cases contemplated in Article 53 the compromise shall be settled by a commission consisting of five members , the fifth member to be ex officio President of the commission . " Each party , " says the article , " appoints two arbitrators , of whom one only can be its national or chosen from among the persons selected by it as members of the Permanent Court . " If no agreement is reached within two months ' time eaLh Power draws two members from the Permanent Court , who can not be nationals of either , and from these an umpire is selected by lot .                 @ @ @ @
