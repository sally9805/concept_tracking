Six doctors on derangement last week examined stout , baldheaded , raucous George Remus , who admitted killing his wife but was acquitted by a Cincinnati jury on the ground of insanity ( TIME , Jan. 2 ) . All six agreed he was no longer insane . Five of the doctors also agreed that he was psychopathic , unmoral , hysterical , " subject to unrestrained outbreaks of temper and rage " and , therefore , " dangerous to be at large . " <P> Probate Judge William H. Lueders , an older , more resolute man than Judge Chester R. Shook in whose courtroom the Remus trial was performed , heard the doctors ' decision and without further ado ordered dangerous Mr. Remus to be committed to the State Hospital for the Criminal Insane at Lima , Ohio , until " restored to reason . " <P> Shouted George Remus : " A humorous joke ! A farce ! . . . One of the nine wonders of the world ! * <P> Remus appeals began . Lima loomed . <P> *Cats are believed by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world " commonly number only seven .
