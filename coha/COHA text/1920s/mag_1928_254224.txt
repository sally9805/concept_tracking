Two major themes set the tempo of conversation among smart Swedes last week . <P> Death . A solemn Royal theme was Death . Every official flag in Sweden went to half mast for Prince Friedrich II , 71 , abdicated Grand Duke of Baden in Germany , uncle of the reigning Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg , and brother of Her Majesty Queen Victoria of Sweden . <P> The German citizens of Baden never ceased to cheer His Grand Ducal Highness , when he rode out among them , palsied and almost blind . Once he wore the uniform of Commanding General of the German Eighth Army Corps ; but at the close of the War he was among the first petty rulers of German states to abdicate in favor of Democracy . <P> Moose . The second topic which stirred Swedes , last week , was wild moose . These mighty , antlered game were alarmingly reported to be browsing upon and trampling down thousands of aspen saplings in the province of Smaland . Aspen is a wood much used for making match sticks ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wild moose tales alarmed . <P> Throughout Scandinavia moose hunting is esteemed the noblest use of fire arms . Accordingly there is drastic enforcement of laws protecting wild moose out of season . But next winter a determined Parliamentary lobby will urge modification of the game law in the interest of the Swedish Match Co. , a gigantic monopoly of such wealth and potency that it occasionally makes governmental loans to the smaller states of Europe .
