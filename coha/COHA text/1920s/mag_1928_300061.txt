Warner Brothers Pictures Inc ( Vitaphone sound pictures ) last week arranged to buy Stanley Co. of America ( exhibitors with more than 3.000 cinema houses under control ) . The absorption is a $100,000,000 affair . <P> The deal is of vital importance to Warner Brothers . They were the pioneers in the production of sound-pictures , which this year have given a new spurt to the U. S. amusement industry . But Warner Brothers have had very few houses of their own . While their sound picture rival , Fox Film ( with Movietone ) has customers in the allied Fox Theatres , Warner Brothers have been obliged to depend upon the demand , insistent although it was , of strange and jealous exhibitors . With Stanley Co. it can stand shoulder to shoulder with other great amusement sellers- Paramount-Famous-Lasky , Loew , Fox .
