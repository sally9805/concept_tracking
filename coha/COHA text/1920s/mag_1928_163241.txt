A well worn button , a lock of hair , a bit of bedraggled gold braid , and a wedding ring-such are four relics beyond price which were presented to the Japanese Empire , last week at Tokyo , by the U. S. Ambassador , that puissant , cultured and droopy - mustached Manhattan lawyer Charles MacVeigh . <P> Each relic nestled in a case of gold , each case was enclosed in a sturdy wooden box , and Tiffany &; Co. of Manhattan was the firm which was chosen to envelop the button , hair , braid and ring in suitable magnificence . Last week Japanese were pleased &; honored to receive these four gifts , be cause all are authentic mementoes of intrepid U. S. Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry ( 1794-1858 ) , who opened up Japan to Occidental influence in 1854. * <P> In 1853 the Commodore had sailed into Japanese waters with a U. S. fleet of four warboats ; and a year later he returned to conclude the first treaty ever signed by a Japanese Government with an Occidental power . Prior to Perry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tycoons <P> ( " High Princes " ) toward the Western nations had been maintained for centuries in accordance with the following typical Shogun 's proclamation : " So long as the sun warms the earth let no Christian be so bold as to come to Japan . Let all know that if King Philip + himself or even the very God of the Christian contravene this prohibition they shall pay for it with their heads . Let them think no more of us , just as if we were no longer in the world . " <P> Tokugawa . To accept the Perry relics in behalf of Japan , last week , there came to the U. S. Embassy the great Prince Iyesato Tokugawa . Since 1903 he has been President of the House of Peers , but that is relatively unimportant . The unique distinction of Prince Tokugawa is that he is the heir of the last dynasty of Japanese Shoguns who ruled from 1603 until the last Shogun , Yoshinobu Tokugawa , voluntarily renounced his powers in 1867 , and permitted restoration of the authority of the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme , last week , that the Perry relics should have been accepted by Shogun-descended Prince Tokugawa , and not by the present Sublime Emperor of Japan , Hirohito , whose ancestors never so much as laid eyes upon Commodore Perry , or his button , braid , hair , ring . <P> The extremely simple presentation ceremony took place , last week , over a luncheon table at the U. S. Embassy . Present were Prime Minister General Baron Giichi Tanaka , and moon-faced Viscount Shibusawa , " The Morgan of Japan . " <P> Said Prince Tokugawa in his brief speech of acceptance : " The peaceful diplomacy of the late Commodore Perry enabled the United States to accomplish more in opening up the Orient to trade than other nations could achieve by force . " The Perry relics , promised Prince Tokugawa , will be cherished and displayed in the Imperial Museum at Tokyo. * <P> Tycoon . Guests at the Ambassadorial luncheon beheld in Prince Tokugawa a smart , potent , cultured gentleman , in every sense entitled to the smart , modern courtesy title of tycoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
