PORGY-DuBose Heyward-Doran ( $2.00 ) . Straightforward story-telling in a poet 's prose is always rich reading . Poet Heyward 's province is South Carolina-Negro life along the waterfront of old Charleston , with the atavistic rhythms , religion and animalism firmly rendered , the dialect perfect , the antics convulsing . Porgy , a purple-black beggar with crippled legs and a pungent goat , croons to his scampering dice , prays with his neighbors in Catfish Row , contemplates the insignificance of man . In a shadowy triangle involving Crown , a cinnamon stevedore with a chest like a cotton-bale , and his big wench Bess , Porgy 's soul undergoes the extremes of compassion and ruthless violence , much as the city now basks sleepily in hot sun , now is hammered with a furious hurricane , now basks again .
