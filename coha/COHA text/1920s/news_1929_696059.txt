txt Federal Reserve Board in a special statement indicates general satisfaction with the working out of its policy of attempting to reduce speculative loans through cooperation of member banks . At the same time , it was made plain that this policy is to be continued in full effect , to the end of releasing an increasing amount of commercial credit and if the desired readjustment is not brought about through the present plan of oranntary co-operation , the reserve system has ? further powers to influence the situation . The board has found that the flow of funds into the security markets has not slowed down business except in the building industry . The board is seeking to guard against such a slowing down by readjustment of the credit situation to assure trade and industry a supply of bank credit at reasonable rates . The statement has no connection with the meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank governors , although it is ' understood that its contents were made known to them . The statement is an extract from the coming ibsue of the Federal Reserve Bulletin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Recent Credit Policy , " the board says : " The Federal Reserve System has been aware of the consequences , present and prospective , of high money rates to the country 's business , and has pursued a policy formulated with a view to correcting the situation that was causing these high rates . The Federal Reserve Board 's statement of February ' 7 , which was published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin for February , pointed out that , owing to the unusual absorption of credit in the security markets , money rates to business were increasing at a time of the year when money conditions are usually easy . In this statement , the board endeavored to enlist the cooperation of the Federal Reserve banks and member banks , in order to bring about an orderly readjustment in the credit situation . Progress in this readjustment in recent weeks is indicated by the decline in brokers ' loans of member banks .

While the 53-stem recognizes that one of its most important functions is to protect this country 's gold reserves , in existing circumstances these reserves need protection primarily against wasteful absorption into the base of an unduly expanded domestic credit structure , rather than against the demands from abroad . The objective of Federal Reserve policy , therefore , both from the point of view of domestic and business and of world trade conditions , is a readjustment in the credit situation , with a view to assuring trade and industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Brokers ' . Loans Of brokers ' loans the board says : " Demand for funds to finance the trading in securities in the New York market has continued large , but the only increases in brokers ' loans has been in loans by lenders other than tanks . This class of loans showed an increase of about r275.000.000 for the period of seven weeks ended March 27. while street loans by banks . including both New York banks and other banks , declined nearly $300,000.000 . This liquidation of brokers ' loans by banks since the board 's statement of February 7 indicates an effort by banks to comply with the desire of the board to restrain the diversion of bank credit into speculative channels . This liquidation has been accompanied by a further rise from corporations and individuals in this country and abroad . " In recent weeks there has been a considerable growth in the volume of bank credit outstanding , chiefly in response to seasonal demands from trade and industry , the board says . Security loans by banks have shown a small increase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City , the growth it : bank credit has been practically confined to the so-called " all other loans " ? that is , those not secured by stocks and bonds . In Chicago . bank loans on securities increased in February and to the last week in March , accompanied by loss of funds through intersectional clearings and an increase in borrowings from the Reserve bank . Notwithstanding a sharp reduction in the last week of March . loans in the district were larger at the end of March than at the beginning of February . For the past seven weeks , there has been . therefore , a general growth of commercial loans and a general decline in investments in most of the country . the board says . While security loans showed a small aggregate increase , there was a decline in several districts . Dank Credit Declines Reserve bank credit outstanding in the seven weeks ended March 27 declined about $60,000,000. almost entirely through a decline in bankers ' acceptances , brought about by increases* in rates . With the buying rate on acceptances higher than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell acceptances . This has been an influence in stiffening rates . At the end of March . Reserve bank credit was about $1,400,000,000. some $300.000,000 above the average of a five-year period ended 1927 . Over this period , the board points out . gold imports have predominated , forming a basis for rapid expansion of bank credit . The expansion was the more rapid " owing to the fact that on the liability side of the ledger member banks increased chiefly their time deposits . " which require but a 3 , S reserve , while demand deposits have shown a smaller relative growth . This gave rise to credit expansion at the unusually high rate of $15 of member banks credit to $1 of member bank reserves . ' When the gold movement was reversed , member bank borrowing increased $600.000,000. due to exports and sale of securities by Federal Reserve banks . The board says that it did nothing to offset the tightening effect of exports , but rather increased their effect . The board says : " The system 's policy was not dictated by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the system was due to the fact that bank credit was rapidly expanding in this country , and particularly in the form of security loans , while the current requirements of trade and industry made relatively little demand for additional board credit . " The board then traces the continued increase in money rates , and says : " Several foreign banks have had to advance their rediscount rates in order to protect their gold reserve from further losses . In the domestic situation , high rates have caused a flow of non-banking funds into the security market , but have not had the effect of slowing down business activity , except in the building industry , which appears to have been unfavorably affected by the difficulty of floating bonds . The unfavorable condition of the bond market , due to high money rates caused by the rapid growthmin the demand for credit by the security market , has also greatly reduced foreign borrowing in this country , and consequently has made it more difficult for foreign countries to obtain the exchange necessary to pay for American products .
