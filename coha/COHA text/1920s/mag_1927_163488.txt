THE PORTRAIT OF A BANKER-Anna Robeson Burr-Duffield ( $5 ) . <P> COMMODORE VANDERBILT-Arthur D. Howden Smith-McBride ( $5 ) . <P> CERTAIN RICH MEN-Meade Min-nigerode-Putnam ( $3.50 ) . <P> James Stillman , silent president of the National City Bank of New York , tranquil friend of a few intimates speaks : " During the Gold Panic of 1894 the U. S. Treasury begged J. P. Morgan for 50 millions , which he refused , thundering ' Impossible ! ' Then they came to me and I went ' round to see what I could do : He was greatly upset and overcharged , nearly wept , put his head in his hands and cried : ' They expect the impossible ! ' So I calmed him down and told him to give me an hour and by that time I cabled for ten millions from Europe for the Standard Oil and ten more from other resources and came back . I told him : ' I have twenty millions . ' <P> " ' Where did you get them ? ' And when he heard-il bondit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became perfectly bombastic and triumphant , as the Savior of his Country . . . . You see , he is a poet ; Morgan is a poet . " <P> Again silent Banker Stillman speaks . In England , he learned that Mr. Morgan was living alone . So he paid a call one hot June morning . " Morgan asked , ' What brought you here to see me , Stillman ? ' I answered , ' Oh , I thought you might be lonely . ' Whereat Morgan jumped up from the table and ran around and kissed me on the cheek ! " <P> James Stiilman , whom Wall Street cursed as an unapproachable legend of money power , had the gift to see himself as others saw him , and more . He saw exactly what he willed to do , and with almost as much preciseness what others planned . He had the trick of completing another 's thoughts . That was at times embarrassing to him , for it gave him a reputation for wizardry which he disclaimed . Near his death , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money we were after ; ' t was the power . We were all playing for power . It was a great , game . " And most of his potent play-fellows in that game-among them John D. Rockefeller , Edward H. Harriman , Jacob Schiff-liked him sincerely , warmly .
