The city culturally has been a family without a hearthstone . . . . " These were the words of onetime ( 1922-27 ) U. S. Senator George Wharton Pepper ; the hearthstone to which he referred was the Pennsylvania Museum of Art , at whose dedication he was making a speech . The new museum stands above the Schuylkill River , on a spot once tenanted by factories and tenements ; here it had been envisaged 20 years ago by John E. Reyburn , then mayor of Philadelphia .
