THE MAD LOVER-Richard Connell-Minion , Batch ( $2 ) . Be not dismayed if you hear that this book deals with the spendthrift son of an Irish-American pioneer in a city with slums and polo , like Toledo . Author Connell writes books on transatlantic steamers and French park benches . He knows no more about sons of Irish-American pioneers than he does about Mongolian law or any other dull literary subject . Author Connell is an Irish poet who was made cheerful by being born in Poughkeepsie , N. Y. With no sorrows of Deirdre for ballast , his fancy flies off on such tangents as The Prince Has the Mumps , which is said to have tickled the imperial risibilities of George V. <P> Connell characters , as perfect and unreal as fashion advertisements , achieve life by the sheer velocity of their improbable actions . The Prince reappears in this novel precisely that way , deus ex machina . He modestly accepts a hand-knitted sweater from Hero Gerald Shannon , thereby enabling the latter to become a Self-Made Man and town-builder back in Ireland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U. S. How might that be ? By the same token that Gerald Shannon chances to hang his shoes on the chandelier and trousers in the tub , and to take a circus troupe to a senator 's party , and to sing Rocked in the Cradle with a freight-yard detective , and to be very unwell on a mule-ship . Author Connell simply wants his hero to do those things and the hero does them with the utmost whimsical dispatch . There are some grand Irish moonlight and love talk in the last chapter too . Author Connell is a literary first cousin of both Funnyman Robert Benchley and Romancer Donn Byrne.
