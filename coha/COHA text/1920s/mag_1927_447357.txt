We have actually bought our hectare of land near the hay , where we mean to breed ducks : a strip of grazing land beyond the dike , a mile or more distant from the village . It is fenced in , but devoid of buildings of any description , and as we can not afford to build a. house , we have bought two small baraquements de guerre ? the army barracks I hat are being sold so cheaply all over France .

Winter I must , confess that I am doing my housework wit h extraordinary inefficiency , though with unabated good will . I never have learned to cook decently , and the boys succeed far better than I do at it , but . they care less about keeping things tidy than I do . Coal dust , kerosene oil , grease , and muddy hoots are my perpetual unconquered enemies .

The boys drove one hundred and twenty tarred stakes into the . ground ? old railway sleepers sawed in two ? by , way of a temporary foundation . Then the weather broke , and sheets of rain came ( 1011 ' 11 unceasingly and flooded the road leading to our meadow . The motor truck could get no nearer than two miles or more from the foundation , and all the material was left in a field at the spot where the highway ended , A cart and t vo strong horses were hired to move the stuff to its destination . It took a week to get through that job , as the horses could do no more than two or three trips It day , and during that week the rain never stopped .

When I went Out to watch proceedings , the driver told me it was a job for eight strong men . It strained our men 's strength and endurance to the breaking point . They came home after dark dogired , drenched to the bone , and hardly able to eat their suppers . I felt rather anxious during that week , but . in due time it was over , and I was taken out to see Our House standing upright on its black stakes , like a giant centipede .

It had been a black barrack at best ; now the paper or cardboard which had covered its outer walls came off in patches , giving the impression of sonic sort of skin disease . There were gaps and chinks and crevices in every wall , the roof leaked , and the rain had run through cracked ceilings and floors . The wind got under the lloor and tried to raise it . bodily . One r truer seemed inclined to gape open . The north wall threatened to cave in , and it was a hard job to prop it up and make it solid . It looked , on the whole , like the dilapidated booth of a wandering circus . The two carpenters from P , taples had not even tried to join the sections of wall properly , and remarked that these buildings never stood being moved .

Books and pencil and paper seem to prove conclusively that a well-regulatecl poultry farm is very profitable , and that this part of France is propitious for breeding clucks . The two conditions to success are artificial hatching and the complete absence of hired labor . My nephew will throw in his lot with ours , which will make two men and two boys to do the work , with me to keep house . It . seems feasible . When the first three hundred ducklings are hatched out we shall have no warm enough shelter for them , I fear , and yet . we can not put off their appearance and t heir sale !

There is a watering trough at the farther end of the meadow , holding some muddy water and a number of frogs ? still , it is water . The Eldest and my nephew , with one hundred hens and sixty ducks , are hoping to settle clown there next week . I can not risk it with the youngsters yet ; our future dwelling still has so many cracks in floors , ceilings , and walls that it is like a. sieve and needs a lot of time and work still to be really habitable . It settled on its stakes and all its joints gape open a bit . I shall wait . till April before I move in , as for a time it will mean camping out amid many ducklings and few comforts .

April 8 Item I am , in Paris . The boys asked me to give them it little more time to get the place ready , so , after tidying up the house we have used as winter quarters , I decided to come here . The house is neither finished nor furnished , but there seems little chance of accomplishing this until some of the ducklings have been reared , fat toned , and sold to Paris restaurants , so we are in a state of suspended animation for a couple of months .

We are called La Altura RIG/se ; everyone knows us . I am actually at home chez ems ! It was on the fourteenth of April that . I returned from Paris , quite ready to share the boys ' life in a barn .

The contrast to the rest of the house made this one room look wonderfully bright and fresh and cozy . I realized all the pains that had been taken with it , and the amount of work it had meant . Many other things had been accomplished , such as making it well , laying drains , and so on , which I heard about later ; but in the midst of chaos is a clean , tidy room which looks like it room , and the whole family often look in to feast their eyes upon it . ( ' hairs , a real jug and basin on the stand , hooks and a deep shelf behind the curtained-off cupboard - all their pocket money went and they cut down on their food to manage it !

At present they sleep with the incubators , which need watching day and night , for we could not afford the self-regulating American machines Which save so much work and turn t he eggs automatically . In the future kitchen , on a floor of cardboard and fine sand , penned in by boards , dozens and dozens of fluffy balls which pretend to be ducklings and chickens disport I hemselves round a special stove called nnc elereuse .

IIe developed chicken pox , and as the bed where he was obliged to remain while his temperature was high was in close proximity to the incubator , which was hatching just . then , lie took a dislike to ducklings in general . Then my nephew and both younger boys sickened with the same disease ; they had it violently and felt . ill and neglected . The Eldest and I , left . short-handed at . a critical t ime , are said to have been most heartless and unsympathetic ; beyond dumping down food and drink on a packing case in the sick room , we did nothing to relieve the sufferers . 4i18 TII E PR I NC ESS AND THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are taken out for an airing daily , and wander into I he tall grass , and have 10 be watched , searched for , and counted ; now they have learned to get . out of their enclosure and raid the dining room , where we are cooking our meals at present , and follow us about like dogs .

My five sons are all with . us : Nikola , John , Sandro , And rick , and Dim ; also my nephew ; and for six weeks his two young sisters have joined us . The men and boys wear coarse dark blue overalls and the girls print dresses ; all are sunburned , act ive , happy , and doing their best .. Their appetites are excellent , and pints of milk and great . hunches of bread disappear in a twinkling . Their capacity for enjoyment . is boundless as well , and work is now accompanied by songs and laughter . Some of my housework is tieing taken over in a very well-meaning and rather amateur fashion by the young people . My nieces take care of the kitchen , but as they are very young and apt to forget things , I have a little more than usual to do sometimes , especially after all the youngsters have been to the casino in town for a dance , ? when their day has not been too hard and tiring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning . The farm is a playground now , and I am a spectator . I need not amuse them , I need only stand aside for them to ; House themselves , and I see that boys and girls can amuse themselves very thoroughly without flirting , and set off on foot for a dance , carrying their slippers in a parcel , with the same enjoyment and zest as girls used to feel over real balls when I was young . My family maintains I hat the thing I enjoy in our present conditions is that . no one bothers me about . matters of dress . When I see the trouble toy boys takeover ironing a collar or 1 he trousers of a Sunday suit , I wonder if this is a good thing or not . It certainly seems a pity to feel uncomfortable over a shabby suit , lad it is natural when one is young , as is their wish of bettering their conditions and working back to a more congenial way of living .

But it is all wrong : beans and . peas and cauliflower should go to market , leaving us the onions and potatoes . We eat our new-laid eggs , we eat our nice fresh vegetables , we devour what the farm produces , : Hid I an delighted that the boys are no longer underfed , as they have been in a degree for years . It makes our life much cheaper , but it . is not the way to make money for the future . My only serious trouble is the thought of the younger boys ' education . We are too tired at night to teach and they to learn , so the idea of teaching them ourselves has conic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schooling . I still believe that they have gained some very useful knowledge in that year , but to let them forget all they know and turn into farmhands for good , at their age , is an idea I can not resign myself to . So we arc hoping , when the summer holiday is over , to get them into schools for Russian boys such as the one near Vichy , an American school with French tuition , a Russian priest and teachers or Russian literature and history , very low prices ? and very few vacancies ! Dim is growing robust nail contented , quite ready to become a little peasant , but And ? ick longs passionately to complete his secondary education at least , and takes the present situation rather tragically to heart , though he works exceptionally well . There was a time when I felt that culture and leisure to read and think were slipping away and I was turning into a niece drudge and beast of burden .

Your back is bent , your hands occupied , but your whole being is absorbing the sunshine and dew and all the peace around you , blends with the big , simple , real things , and draws stability from them . Our great problem now is to cheapen the ducks ' food , since their appetites can not be reduced . Excellent food for than is it kind of clam or mussel to be had for not hing at low I ide about . a mile or two from here . So far , we buy them ; but when the building of the farm is completed and time less precious , the boys can fetch them . We shall have our own grain for the old ducks and straw for their beds , but we must build a storehouse for grain and potatoes and build a small ducks ' hospital at , some distance from the other birds . Up to six weeks , ducklings have it fenced-in exercise ground , smooth and sandy . Afterward they are moved over into grassy plots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelters for bad vomiter and a small level sandy place in front for feeding . So they have a clover pasture to disport themselves and catch worms and insects in . The fetching of mountains of sand in barrows to keep all this clean and tidy takes time ; in our future plan is a swimming bath to be dug out , and t he water kept fresh by pumping it into the ditch . Now this is all very well ; but when the ducks ' toilet arrangements and comfort are assured , I most have a refuge of my own from ducks , dirt , mud , buckets of feed to be mixed , pails of water to be drawn , perpetual backache and all unpleasantness . I want It hot bath daily ; pictures , books , ( lowers , clean hands , a comfortable armchair , a fireplace out of reach of the kitchen smells , white table linen ? all the things I professed to care nothing for , the fleshpots of Egypt !

July 20 The recent heat wave is over ; thunderstorms gat her daily , only to pass over our heads and burst elsewhere . The garden is getting very dry ; two new wells dug by the boys ? deep holes which we call wells  --  provide some of our vegetable beds with water ; the rest , with the potato field , will have to be abandoned to their fate . But my enemies the weeds are its sturdy and prickly as ever ; no drought affects them . I have never been able to weed or do any sort of work in gloves ; consequently my hands arc in a disgraceful condition ? Tolstoy himself would approve of them , What incalculable harm that great , man did to our young generation , and how terrible was his expiation .

In order to see this light more distinctly , they hasten to extinguish the torches which lighted their way , and so remain ? tempora ? ily , at least ? in utter darkness . But it is only when there is no yearning for light , when men grow indifferent told callous , that ihespiritud life seems suspended and things look hopeless . Ihtve you ever noticed that it all begins with denying Evil as an active principle ?

The older I grow the better I understand and appreciat e Post oievsky 's genius . Many of his words turned out to be prophecies , and none understood the Russian psychology as he did or believed so firmly in the destiny of the Russian THE PRINCESS AND THE DUCKLINGS people .

I realized then that photographs and plans of t he most glorious edifice could not replace I he roughest and simpleststructure built wily one 's own hands ? that a. crisis had come which must be faced squarely . The only thing left was to start all over , to make and shape and hake bricks , one by one , with which to build a shelter . This happened to me in the very first of our exile . Well ?

As for the house , the boys hope to have it ready soon to turn over to me for the final coats of paint on doors and window frames . We shall whitewash the messy things as our Podolian peasants do . Viten our young birds are sold and only one hundred and fifty ducks left , we shall all be able to rest for a bit . And I can say quite frankly to you how tired I sometimes get of ducks and ducklings , their smell , their appetites , their illnesses and sudden deaths , their absurd accidents ? like drowning in two inches of water in the drinking trough ) !

I consulted a vet , and ' Plus it 71 en a , plus its crevent ' was his only comfort . So we repair all the 4+2 THE PRINCESS AND ' 1711E DUCKLINGS damages caused by every storm , bury our ducklings , and try to make the best of it , and plan for high and dry floors and well-drained buildings with hot-water pipes for heat , which we hope to have ready for next year , and new ditches to drain our flooded domain ; but , for the present we are helpless and can only splash about in the puddles and hope for a change of weather .

And worst . of all , a hundred ( lucks I took so much trouble to rear must now be killed and plucked and sent to IN , ris . Of course this is a consummation devoutly to be wished , though 1 had hoped to send ( hem off alive in baskets , with some barley for the journey ; but restaurants want plucked fowls .

My head is full of plans , and if materials of every kind were less expensive I really believe we could fix up this house with our own hands to be a credit to anyone . As it is , old packing cases have had to be turned into furniture , except for our lit tle iron beds , of course , which were bought at . a sale ; and though we are very proud or the result , 1 am not . sure anyone but ourselves would admire it .

We lacked the courage to save them by cramming all our bedrooms full of them , and our efforts in bringing quantities of sand , making temporary floors , and putting up extra stoves to warm and dry them , failed . The torrents of rain continued and the water rose steadily , and our kitchen filled with shipwrecked ducks . The whole house could not have held half of them , but of course some could have been saved in our bedrooms at the sacrifice of our bourgeois instincts and prejudices .

Of course t hi ! choice or this shore and this particular low-lying patch of hold was the primary mistake . But last summer , when we first saw it , the weather was so line and dry here that we never suspected what , the climate could be like , nor that our farm behind that substantial dike could he flooded . It probably was a mistake , too , to start with so small a capital , but under the circumstances this could not be helped . We had to buy cheap incubators which proved almost worthless , when we should have had it first-class one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our own eggs should be used for hatching , not eggs which have been subjected to transport . These things one learns from experience ; in fact , this has been a year of expe ? iences . We had several hundred birds where We hoped to have several thousand . This year 's disaster must be faced and accepted . There is no doubt that it cripples us far more than our neighbors , who have also suffered from the weather , but who have reserves for such emergencies . Most of them raise cat tie , and a flooded pasture is not such a calamity as a flooded poultry farm . A good thing for the boys is that , they must keep on working . Even if we have to sell the farm , it must , first he brought , into proper condition , the buildings completed , and the harm done by the water repaired . Of course we are very blue , but we can not stop to think how we feel ; we 1 ? ust , keep on !

Should we fail completely and have to scatter in search of work , I should still feel that the time spent here will not have Icon wholly wasted ; it has done more for the boys than they know , were it only the clean , salt-wind-blown life and the fact or having a home . To see my boys almost their old selves again is enough to make me grateful for tills life , failure and all . They have certainly not made a foo tune yet , lout t hey have taken care of nu , and worked to the best of their ability , which means more . Aly own difficulties are of a very different order : not to lose one 's temper or let little things ruffle one ; never to say ' I told you so !

The trouble is that you can never get . straight for good by one effort or sacrifice ; before you know where you are , the same but tle has to be fought all over again . And here we have not even the spiritual support of living near a church . Septcuther 17 I am afraid my hutst letter was a bit dejected . A week 's bright sunshine has made me feel more cheerful upon all subjects , and after all , we each have our little immediate tasks and must not . worry about . what we can not mend .

Speaking of material things , I wonder why so many of us Russians fail . Is it inefficiency only , or are we not destined 444 THE PRINCESS AND THE DUCKLINGS to succeed in exile ? One of your American correspondents says in a recent magazine article that Russian refugees all over the world are broken people and can be of no further account in the question of Russia 's future . Well , I believe ? and it is a great comfort to inc ? that Russia 's future does not depend on the welfare or survival of a few hundred thousands of us . It is for us exiles that I fear the consequences of losing touch with our country .

Church is now our one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's hearts and consciences , nothing else is left standing . All through their sins and downfall , their suffering and expiation , the people at home have still clung to their Church , and this many of us still have in common with them .

November Even when things are most difficult here and we are prone to grumble at being chained to this patch of land , we realize that it has proved a blessing and that we may pull through . By pulling through I do not mean being well off , but reaching the pint where the farm is able to feed , warm , and clothe us to a certain degree , besides giving us shelter . Of course we are too many here , and of course we ought all to live in one room , round one stove and one lamp , instead of enjoying a little privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little lire for an hour or two in the evenings in our little iron stoves , and hot water too . The trouble is that we are only sham peasants after all , and can not yet form the habit of ' going to lied with the chickens its real ones do . Luckily , after a spell of cold weather we always have a few mild days to thaw in , and they save coal and comfort us . Ily all of which you will see that I have got safely through my autumn attack of the blues ! The kitchen should be the living room by rights , if we are to pat tern ourselves on the local custom , but ours is put to so many uses ! Favorite birds and sick birds live there , linen is washed and dried , ducks plucked before packing , ducks ' food prepared . It is so full of miscellaneous objects , all particularly necessary at the moment , that I ha ve given up toy dream or a kitchensitting-room , cheerful , cozy , and neat . January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one this year , too . I have had such a splendid time with my youngsters during their holidays ! A Christmas tree , in a box full of earth so as to plant it the very next day in the Refuge ; lots of oranges and sweets , roast duck and salad of our own raising , coal to keep the house warm , and above all , the delight of being all together again . Now they are kick at school , and I have time to take up my pen and tell you ; Wont it . Of course , lucre is never very plentiful with us , and various necessary trips to Paris with all their attendant , expenses had made us wonder how the boys were to come home for Christmas . Then an unexpected bit came in , and we decided to have a very good time ! A warm blanket for each , and strong boots and warm socks , one excellent cigar for the Eldest , and a dictionary for me , and even another book or two for its all to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1N1 ) THE DUCKLINGS Paris after a very long absence , so as to make it a real reunion , and on his way to the station to meet his father the Eldest looked in at the post office and found your pierce ! . Ile brought it home with his father 's valise and our supper in a complete jumble . We had quite a festival : an oukha ( a Russian soup made of fish with bits of potato in it ) , a beefsteak , fried potatoes , cabbage , dried figs , and coffee . Theo we cleared the table , lit cigarettes , put on coal , as the weather is cold , and , gathering round the lamp , opened your parcel . I wish you could have seen us at it . Never since my childhood have I enjoyed unwrapping a surprise so much . The green papers and Christmas cards all looked so wonderfully cozy . The customs officials had kept . the box for a long time , but did it no harm in the end . Alter examining the contents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Eldest and his cousin settled down to the first puzzle , while I said I would leave this occupation to them till I got . through my last translation . But . I heard them discussing words and letters , and was led to offer a suggestion which happened to be a fortunate one . Then we all went completely mad , and got to bed at impossible hours of t he night , and enjoyed ourselves quite absurdly . And now I really must . keep those books under lock and key till all the day 's work is properly finished , or there will be nothing done on this farm . It is a virulent catching disease , a form of mania , I believe , and we have all caught it ! Aly husband took it a fortnight ago when ill in Paris , over some puzzles in one of the English papers he reads , so he was the most experienced member of our mad family . Is it a passing madness or a lasting one ? Very fascinating , at any rate . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall keep it for the younger boys to do over again . The other will give us plenty of occupation for a long time to come. , and it is wonderful practice for our English . My feeble vocabulary ought to revive quickly by its aid . During the twenty-four hours when we were all here together we called a family council and sat down with a pencil and paper to figure things out . Our bit of land is evident ly swamped by rains periodically , and for this reason people more experienced than we were would not buy this farm for raising poultry ; neither ducklings nor chickens can flourish in the damp , and the only really dry place in all seasons is the house , because 1 he floors are half metre above ground . The walls want another hot summer like our first . to dry them through and through , but it is still dry enough for young birds . Now the youngsters have a large room which they use only in the holidays ; so we have made up our minds to the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six weeks old are to be given this room to be born and reared in , right in the midst . of the house , with a door made through the outer wall to enable them to get out on fine sunny days . The boys are to live elsewhere together as best . they may . It will be an incentive to keep the bird infants as clean as they possibly can be kept , but the fact remains that they will squeak and smell all over the house ! I have stopped protesting , because it is unreasonable to risk another disastrous year , and now that . we must begin over again very modestly , we really should do anything that will better conditions . It is a question of three , or four months ' incubation and early rearing , and it . is easier to keep an eye on the beastly birds indoors . If we fail with them again , we must turn the whole hectare into a kitchen garden . 41t3 THE PRINCESS AND THE DUCKLINGS There is an element of cheer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON'or by the middle or this month ; this latitude and longitude differ rather markedly from Russia ! Already we have ve longer light , rat her bet ter Weather , and ( till soon be preparing the garden for spring . I shall draw the house for you sonic day when it is warmer . Very little remains to remind one of the three boarded shanties , ba ? raeks , or sheds ? I hardly know what . to call than ? which We originally bought . lava been rat her I ired : URI bustled and hurried by my work during the past year . Viten all the boys except the Eldest and my nephew loll us . I felt lonely and lost . So few ! Harlan beings and birds left , so lit Ile housework , and so atally stormy days when outdoor work was impossible . ' rho whole place seemed to go to sleep , and grew silent and strange all of a sudden , The boys took over drawing water from the well and fetching the milk . After tidying up and sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast job ? I was left to face a pile of mending in toy own 1 ? 00/11 , relt stale , flat , and unprofitable . Ntissing the youngsters was probably at : I he hot tom of it , for every free moment of mine had formerly belonged to them . And let me tell you that I am not a successful peasant . woman . I wear sabots and a big blue apron , but have to strain my strength to the utmost to accomplish what . it real working woman of my age does with very little effort . or outlay of energy on all the farms about us here . I have improved , but a day 's digging still gives me a backache and makes me feel asthmatic and inefficient .. So , though leisure and rest upset me , ? ' Phan ) nu ' est ran animal d'habitude , ' ? I shall let the boys work while I merely fuss about for a time . For I suddenly understood that the time for recuperating has come and that . I stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a new and rather lazy life : get up later , stop work at a certain hour , and give myself time to read and think . Work will begin soon enough , Ina just . now I can afford to slacken the physical strain and lay in stores . So it seems as if 1 could finally turn my attention to something which I promised to do for you ? write down a sort of history of my memories , drawing as it were a series of pictures for you of our old life . I realize that . the old life in Russia can never come back , and that our children growing up in exile can never know what I have known at first hand . There has been a complete break , the end of the old life ; and yet there was so much in the old Russia which I cannot. bear to think lost forever . A. former culture is being buried now , but it must , after a period of time , be excavated again if the history of our country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end and the beginning of an epoch , so the revolution and overturning of a whole system in Russia will soon live only in the memories of us older ones , and especially because so much of Russia has been unknown and misunderstood by the rest of the world . There has been in our intensely national life something cut oft , hidden from even our nearest European neighbors . And then 1 should like those who have become friends since this new phase of my life began to know and understand a little of what makes the background of every new picture , every new experience , for me . So you can picture me quiet and lazy as to my hands , but with my mind often very far from here . My equipment is a deal chair , a cold room , a dark evening , a small lamp , and a pair of spectacles !
