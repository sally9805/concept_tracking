The Marriage Bed-Ernest Pascal , novelist , Ernest Pascal , film scenarist , becomes Ernest Pascal , playwright . While preparing dramas for the cinema he wrote a play , last week produced in Los Angeles with considerable California clat and a good smattering of sound Manhattan theatre . It was an able play , staged with excellent ability by Robert Milton , famed Broadway director. * The principal performers were Alice Joyce and Owen Moore , cinemactors . <P> Following his novel of the same name Playwright Pascal proved why a wife should not divorce a husband who has been unfaithful . He placed his characters in the suburbs , brought the husband 's woman out to see them , had a thorough , earnest airing of the family dirty linen . Mr. Pascal does not try " to be funny about divorce , nor is he tragic . He is honest rather than brilliantly original . <P> Alice Joyce gave a good show , perhaps the best job that any potent cinema player attempting the stage has done to date . She can not , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives decided promise . Owen Moore , less good , played sullenly . Both were nervous , appalled by the mass of cinema potentates in the opening audience , purveyors of huge talking picture contracts to players who can talk . <P> <P> * Outward Bound ; He Who Gets Slapped .
