ONE INCREASING PURPOSE-A . S. Hutchinson-Little , Brown ( $2.00 ) . Some people take the author of // Winter Comes for a well-meaning fellow , whose inarticulateness is brought on by a great and overpowering sincerity . Others profess to find in his lapses of grammar , his incessant repetition of hanging phrases and mazes of parenthetical elucidation , the traits of a deliberate genius for writing of the perplexing muddle known as Life to Average People . Still others , a critical few , whose censure affects the sales of Author Hutchinson 's books about as much as it would discourage gum-chewing among U. S. salesladies , maintain that this author is a harmless dolt with a flair for illiterate sob-mongering . <P> Author Hutchinson 's own view of himself is brightened by the radiant fact that his books do sell , en masse . In this latest , he consumes 448 pages with a halting account of how , after the War , Simon Paris by an unspectacular miracle found " Christ the Common Denominator , " and became an active ( soapbox preaching ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , except that Simon 's two brothers ( " Old Niggs " and " Old Charles " ) were unhappy and he was kind to them . The wife of one was ravishing but gambled and fell ill with smallpox . The wife of the other wanted to run off with a doctor but stopped when Simon notified her that " Old Charles " had cleared her way by blowing his own head in.
