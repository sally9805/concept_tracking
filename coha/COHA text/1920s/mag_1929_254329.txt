John Joseph Bernet , son of Swiss immigrant , is 61 ; has iron-grey hair , tousled ; looks something like the hardheaded , two-fisted old-school railroader . As president of the Erie Railroad he last week ordered 20 engines from the Lima Locomotive works , 15 from Baldwin Locomotive works . This was remarkable , not because a railroad needs engines , but because nobody doubted that the Erie could afford them . Indeed , the Erie could afford to have them monogramed in gold . For , now at last , the Erie is making money and John Joseph Bernet has proved himself one of the greatest of railroad tycoons . Two months of 1929 show a surplus of $1,189,442 as compared with a corresponding 1928 deficit of $390,675 . <P> The big change began when Cleveland 's famed Brothers Van Sweringen got the road and put Mr. Bernet in charge . Mr. Bernet 's genius began to show when , in 1916 , the same Brothers Van Sweringen put Mr. Bernet on the Nickel Plate which was then described as " two streaks of rust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning with the Erie was characterized by the scrapping of 400 locomotives and 8,000 box cars . The former he replaced by a new type of freight locomotive which he himself developed . He also startled steelmen by paying them cash for his new rails . And what with one thing and another he battered his operating ratio* down so that in 1927 it was less than 82 , and in 1928 it was 76.49 . Thus he seemed in fair way to have battered the truth out of that old Wall Street wheeze : <P> Young Son : Father , I know nothing about the stock market . <P> Rich Father : Son , all you need to know is that the Exchange opens at 10 a. m. and that Erie never pays a dividend . <P> Great though the Bernet achievement with Erie is , Mr. Bernet 's sphere of influence is even greater for he sits in with the Brothers Van Sweringen in direction of all their 13,000 miles of rail , and might well be made President of the entire system should it be consolidated during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sensationally successful Van Sweringen real estate development adjoining Cleveland . <P> * Ratio between receipts and operating expenses .
