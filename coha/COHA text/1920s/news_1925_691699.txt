txt Tennessee came to Dayton today in overalls , gingham and black to attend the trial of John Thomas Scopes for the teaching of evolution . The Tennesseans ? and nearly all the7visitors were Tennesseans ? came from mountain farms near Dayton , where work , usually begun at daylight , had been deserted so that gaunt , tanned , toil-worn men and women and shy children might be in the Rhea County Court House by ii o'clock to see William Jennings Bryan 's " duel to the death " with " the enemies of the Bible . " The expected horde of visitors from distant points had not materialized  --  at least not yet . Those-who did come today came in small automobile , built high because of the rocky mountain roads . They came in wagons fitted with settees and chairs and drawn by biglegged - horses and small-legged mules . Some came on foot . All were soberfaced , tight-lipped , expressionless , for they were to witness , It seemed to them , a " battle for the Lord . " They overflowed the crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the great lawn of the court house shaded by newly whitewashed maples and newly planted with strange pipes , where one pressed a button and bent to drink for relief from the sun which beat down upon the village . They sat on the benches of an open-air tabernacle . improvised by an itinerant evangelist , who had a pulpit against a wall of the building . Listen to Volunteer Evangelists . They stood in groups under the trees , listening to volunteer and lay evangelists , moved by the occasion to ... peak for the " Word . " They listened to blind minstrels , who sang mountain hymns with promises of reward for the weary and faithful , to other . minstrels who sang more worldly songs , and to a string quartet of negroes . They walked up and down hot , dusty Market Street , with its squat one and two story 1 buildings , hung with banners , as for a carnival in which religion and business had become strangely mixed , lined with soda-water , sandwich and book stalls . They sat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early harvest apples and tomatoes , and ttlioenye dstood s , a be ao te aanpeddler n swhioi d ad.iuncgcautiously , for the East Tennessean ' loves a bargain . They even experimented with a slot machine in which one dropped a nickel and got five brass checks good for a quarter once in a while , or more often a stick of gum . But most of them remained on the court house lawn , for there , at least , they could be near Mr. Bryan , who was to defend their trust in the infallibility of the Bible , and could hear the evangel , ists and the minstrels . To the preaching they listened silently , without expression . They had heard it all before . They read , too , the signs on the trees : " Read your Bible daily " and " Be sure your sins will find you out . " And slowly , without expression , they read a larger one hung at the front gate of the lawn , which was headed " The Kingdom of God , " and continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street is at hand . Do you want to be a sweet angel ? Forty days of prayer . Itemize your sins and iniquities for eternal life . If you come clean , God will talk back to you in voice . " Minstrel Sings of Heaven . The minstrels seemed . to stir them most . Will Grissom , a blind man with a portable organ , sat at the iron fence at Market Street . only half shaded from the broiling sun , playing mountain hymns , while scores of men and women stood or sat in the grass listening raptly , their eyes shining as the blind man sang : We read of a place called Heaven : It 's made for the pure and the free . These truths in God 's Word He bath given ? How beautiful Heaven must be : How beautiful Heaven must be . Sweet home of the happy and free . ratr haven of rest for the weary . Row beautiful Heaven must be ! Stanza after stanza the blind man sang , and after every stanza the refrain " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standing men softened and the ' women who sat under the trees closed their eyes . When the blind man had finished with the promise of Heaven for the weary , a score of men came with coins in gnarled hands and dropped them carefully in his faded , black hat . A little way off . Carley Oaks . another blind man . played &on; a guitar and mouth organ , or played ' the guitar and sang lighter songs , in the tunes of which were the measures of the Virginia reel and the plaintive notes of ancient ballads to which new words had been written . One extolled indirectly , and by ridicule of the Kaiser , the prowess of the American soldier . The crowd liked it , for many of them had served overseas with the Thirtieth Division and came of the same mountain stock which bred the Tennessean Sergeant Alvin York . Oaks sang it to the time of " Frankle and Johnny , " and one stanza ran : Hindenburg said to the Kaiser , " you 'd better get your gun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me room to run I see the boys of your - Uncle Sam . " But , while the crowds listened to the evangelists and the minstrels , and accepted pamphlets with chapter and verse citations for Bible reading and took copies of a weekly newspaper , The Conflict , recently established to combat evolution , they almost uniformly after a few moments satisfied their curiosity about the cranks and the preachers of strange ideas who have descended upon Dayton like a visitation of locusts . Georgia Preacher Is Ignored . One of the preachers , who traveled up from Georgia in a bungalow on wheels , wearing an opera hat , an alpaca coat and an ancient pair of trousers similar to those worn by policemen , found no buyers at all . for a pamphlet and presently no listeners to a speech expounding a weird theory that the negro is not human . The Tennessee mountaineer is no " nigger hater . " In fact , he fought in the Union Army to help free the negro , and since he is a man of fixed ideas he shows no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingled freely with white Persons on the lawn of the court house , and last night when T. T. Martin , an evangelist , preached in the open air tabernacle many of his hearers were black . The strange persons with strange causes are getting discouraged already , and it seems as if even those who are less peculiar and whose purposes are understood by the mountaineer are not going to make him alter his ways . The East Tennessean is almost the counterpart of the Connecticut Yankee . He came from the same stock in the British Isles and moved into the hills more than a century ago from Virginia and North Carolina , and there has been no foreign infiltration to change eve-ft the names of Britons and Celts . Dayton is filled with Darwinsdescendants it seems of the Darwins , which bred the originator of the Dar , winian theory  --  Bolens who might if they cared trace kinship with the family which bred Anne Boleyn who became the Queen of Henry VIII. : Pachams. 1Rogerses , Morgans . Haggards , Fishers , Broaduses , , Simses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Connecticut Yankee . as deliberate , as impassive and as thrifty of speech and of money . They are not to be urged , as has been said , into acting otherwise than as usual . Bryan 's Books Pail to Sell . No one , for instance , has yet persuaded them to buy many books for or against evolution , not even M'r . Bryan 's . An enterprising young man came over from Chattanooga with many volumes . There were among them " Famous Figures of the Old Testament , " " In His . Image " and ' ' The Bible and Its Enemies , " all by Mr. Bryan , but late this afternoon not a single copy had been sold . Neither had they bought " God  --  or Gorilla " by Alfred McCann . They sold for as much as $3.50 each , so few Tennesseans bought , and there were few buyers . The young man admitted that he had sold some volumes which sold for twenty-five cents and fifty , but no purchaser bought more than . one . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. H. Sharlduck , Ph.D. , author of " JockoHomo Heaven-bound . " " Hell and the High Schools , " " Evolution or Christ ? " by T. T. Martin , and " The Evolution Issue " by the same author . Henry Fairfield Osborn 's recent work , " The Earth Speaks to Bryan , " remains unsold in Robinson 's drug store , but it may be that Dayton does not care much for reading . Robinson 's drug store is also the town 's sole book shop , with most of its stock of books consisting of " motion picture editions " and more recent editions of fiction , a half hundred volumes in all . Two young women who brought from Chattanooga a cartoon which seemed to bear a resemblance to the lineaments of Mr. Bryan ; yet . also resembled an anthropoid , under . which was printed " He denies his lineage , " were more fortunate than the young bookseller . They sold copies at 15 cents each to the younger men of Dayton , who , however , required considerable urging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this , like , that of the strange preacher from Georgia , was ignored . Near the court house is a large tent where Tom 's Comedians announce that they will play tonight for visitors and celebrities , but only the celebrities will be left to see them , for most , ' of the visitors were mountain folk and the minute the first session of the trial was completed at 3:30 o'clock all these farmers piled their families into their Fords and wagons and drove to their homes . They were getill in their overalls , of course , and there was plenty of daylight left to resume work in their hillside fields .
