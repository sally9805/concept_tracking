OST of us in the United States are not a bit stirred by cooperation . The ephemeral torchlight processions of political radicals arouse much more enthusiasm than the unspectacular but solid gains of cooperation . If , as Huston Thompson , chairman of the Federal Trade Commission , says , " cooperation with all its problems is one of the most portentous , successful , and apparently enduring movements in this great period of world events , " why are n't we thrilled at this growing movement in our midst ? In Europe they are taking cooperation seriously . Here perhaps , in our reckless , profligate way , we think " the effort is too great and the savings are too meager . " Or perhaps we have not yet suffered enough to value it . Most of us still have the pioneer psychology . Even if we are in present straits we hopefully believe that by moving on we can find a better opportunity for ourselves . We are not yet ready " to dig in , " right here on the job . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in search of improved conditions we prefer the excitement of standing on the sidelines and whooping up the other fellow  --  the politician or the boss  --  to better things for us : and then we blame him if things do not get better . But there are some Americans who are pioneering in cooperation . Here , a few sketches of what they are doing : " The visitor to New York goes to see the statue of Liberty ; the visitor to Minneapolis goes to see the Franklin Cooperative Creamery . " One of the daily papers of Minneapolis ran this as a headline last fall . They are proud of their lusty cooperative child out there . The Franklin Cooperative Creamery really is a prodigy . Though it is only four years old , it has more than two-thirds of the milk business of the city . One hundred and fifty-eight white wagons with white horses and glass-lined white automobile tank cars distribute $3,500,000 worth of dairy products to the members annually . The Franklin pays the organized farmer about fifteen cents more for a hundred j @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sells milk at twelve cents a quart ; two , three , even six cents lower than in other large cities . And besides all these money values that the people receive , there is the social value of this creamery to the community . The Commissioner of Health in a public statement largely attributes the reduction in the death-rate of babies and the decrease of typhoid in Minneapolis to its pure milk . Since 1920 the creamery has increased its percentage of butter fats even above the standard required by law and decreased the bacteria count to a lower point than ever before . The surplus savings of the Franklin are used for enlarging their plant , for music and recreation , and for education of the members . Nearly $4,000 has been set aside this year to spread the knowledge of cooperation in the Northwest . Who makes the most fuss about the exorbitant profits of the chain stores ? The workers and the radicals . And who patronizes them most ? Not the profiteers but these same workers and radicals , to the tune of $1,000,000 a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the workers would plug ahead and buy all their food at their cooperative stores they too might begin to challenge the coal barons , as have , for instance , the cooperators in the mill town of Maynard , Massachusetts . In the beginning of 1923 this cooperative society found itself with a surplus of $23,000 because for two years it had distributed no savings-returns to members . The directors decided to go into the coal business . Big gains were being made from their restaurant , grocery store , meat , furniture , milk , and bakery departments . Why not tackle one more of the necessities of life ? Early in the autumn an agreement was made with one of the coal-mining companies of Pennsylvania . Land was purchased near the railroad tracks for $2,100 ; permission was wrung from the railroad company to build a spur ; an overhead trestle and concrete bins were built . The entire plant cost $15,000 . They started to deliver coal late in October ; 2,200 tons of coal had been delivered by the end of March , 1924 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still growing . Somebody brought the story over from Europe in 1921 of how they were building cooperative homes for the homeless ; how homes were being built to live in instead of to sell ; how speculation in real estate and housing was passing out . Instead of cursing the landlords as villains and exploiters the people were quietly putting them out of business by becoming their own landlords . As usual , however , before real cooperative housing  --  the non-profit-making kind  --  could get established in the United States , our enterprising realtors captured the idea , put up apartments to sell , and called them " 100 per cent cooperative . " Up and down the avenues of any of our large cities you can see luxurious " cooperative " apartments flaunting prosperity . Their values run to the millions . The tenants invest from ten to twenty thousand dollars in cash for each apartment . The monthly charges run up from $500 to $600 . Everybody makes something all along the line in the typical American fashion ; first the real-estate speculators , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid the price that these promoters demand , they in turn catch the germ of profit-making . Sometimes they sublet at extortionate profit . Sometimes groups of tenants , owning all the building , occupy only a portion of it : they let the rest at such a high rent that they themselves can live rent-free on the proceeds . Sometimes they sell out at their own price . You ask , " Well , is n't this good for the wise ones who have cooperated in buying the apartment together , instead of continually renting from landlords ? " Of course it is ; but it is not cooperative housing . It does not eliminate speculation in land and homes . Contrast this with genuine you are a you can not property you occupy . You ownowns the property . You ca n't hold more than the house or apartment you intend to occupy ; you ca n't sell or sublet at a profit . But you can , even in America , by investing from $500 to $2,500 , get a permanent , desirable cooperative home . The upkeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to six rooms . This is a saving of almost one-half the rental of similar apartments rented from landlords . These monthly charges decrease as the mortgages are cleared off . The " Garden Homes " of Milwaukee are a proof that this plan works . Over a hundred are already built ; five hundred are planned on a plot of twenty-eight acres , a real cooperative community . And there are many true cooperative apartments in New York , Brooklyn , and a few other cities . The present banking system does not provide loans for the man with ideas or for the worker who has labor power and little else to offer for security . But the people 's banks , or credit unions as they are called in the United States , do . That is the reason they have increased so rapidly in the last few years . The need is here . The people are learning how to supply it . There are 95 credit unions in Massachusetts , 104 in New York , 35 in North Carolina , and a few others scattered through other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept deposits and make loans only to their members  --  telephone girls , mill operators , civil-service clerks , poor-white farmers , even intellectuals . Their shareholdings now amount to $15,000,000 . These savings they loan back to members whose needs and character they know . Over $12,000,000 has thus been used . Practically no losses ? in some districts a small fraction of 1 per cent only , in some absolutely none  --  have been sustained . " Oh , yes , these are the cooperative banks of the big unions , " you say . No , the labor banks are different . There are thirty-five labor banks in the United States with assets of $125,000,000 . They too are growing , but they are not yet cooperative . Their shares are largely held by labor , it is true , but their methods and investments are subject to the ordinary banking laws . There is as yet no national law for cooperative banking . When such a law is passed , these banks may reincorporate and become cooperative . At present they are following the usual course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one significant difference ; these labor banks have voluntarily limited the amount of dividend payable on stock to 10 per cent . Although some have been able to pay more , they have kept their dividends down as low as 8 per cent . The remaining surplus has been used to increase the interest paid to depositors and to decrease the interest charged to borrowers . In Europe , cooperation is standardized . Experimentation is passed ; but until recently we in the United States preferred to blunder along independently rather than to unite with the national federation of consumers ' societies , The Cooperative League , and learn the right way to go about things . An encouraging change is taking place . Three hundred and thirty-three of the strongest consumers ' societies in the United States , doing a combined business of about $15,000,000 a year , have joined the league . As a result of its education , its clearing-house for information , and its standardization , these societies are making better headway than ever before . At the recent cooperative congress , held in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups of cooperative organizations formed a federation for joint buying . They decided no longer to " go it alone " but to buy important staples  --  flour , sugar , etc. ? in carload lots . This is a promising step toward the formation of the much-needed cooperative wholesale . Who would have believed , a few years ago , that three non-profit-seeking cooperatives of several thousand members each could succeed in the heart of competitive business , New York City ? Is it not interesting to know that there are two cooperative restaurants flourishing in the Wall Street section and two in the uptown business district ? They serve 65,000 meals a month . " Our Cafeteria , " now known as Cooperative Services , Inc. , started less than four years ago . It has had a calm , steady growth , nothing very spectacular . Yet the 1,900 members , who have received $14,000 in savings-returns in addition to 6 per cent interest on their capital stock , will tell you that there is a demand for cooperative service even in gay New York . A recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is washing 1,500 bundles of its members ' clothing monthly at a distinct saving . The second " co-op " that knows how to succeed in New York City is the Finnish Cooperative Trading Association , with 1,500 members . It has a meat market , butcher shop , bakery , restaurant , and recreation room . Its success is , of course , more easily explained . It is in Brooklyn , in the center of a Finnish colony , with like habits , like needs , and like traditions . This is fertile soil . Union labor is the unbroken rule in the forty-five cooperative bakeries ranging from the Massachusetts seaboard to the coast of California . Some of these were or-ganized by union bakers who despaired of ever getting better wages and conditions through legislation . Strikes , too , had been of little effect . So the workers started to finance and run their own bakeries . They sold shares also to the consumers . As a result the working class as a whole has benefited . The presence of the " co-op " in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bakers , day by day . And in time of strike , for instance , the great textile strike of 1922 , 170,000 loaves of bread were sent from the cooperative bakeries in Massachusetts to the strikers ' food kitchen . Throughout the land there is a growing understanding of cooperation . Two training-schools for cooperative employees and executives are running annual courses of six weeks each . The colleges and special schools are giving increasing time to courses in cooperation . Spurious , fraudulent , and fanciful schemes have been put out of business by publicity , by court proceedings , or forced to the wall bankrupt . Henceforth they will have little chance of securing a foothold in the United States . Americans are beginning to know real cooperation from " fake . " Cooperators in this country are at last building solidly and laying deep foundations . Most countries have built a cooperative movement first and later sought to add a cooperative culture . In the United States we are building a culture upon which to found the growing movement . We shall succeed . But we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
