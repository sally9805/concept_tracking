Snores of ten textile strikers , abed in the Gastonia , N. C. , * headquarters of the National Textile Workers Union , ceased abruptly early one morning last week when the snorers were nudged awake by revolvers in the hands of a band of masked men . Out into the street the sleepy strikers were marched to the tune of random shots . With crowbar and sledge hammer the invaders-several scores of them , it was too dark to count accurately-set about wrecking the flimsy frame building . Window glass crashed out upon the street and through the aperture went sailing the union 's membership and financial records until the sidewalk was white with torn paper . With the headquarters in ruins , the wreckers moved two doors down the street to a striker 's grocery store , tossed out its contents , departed into the darkness-before-dawn , leaving this sign : WE HAVE QUIT YOUR DAMN UNION In their underclothes , National Guardsmen rushed up just in time to arrest the no-longer snoring strikers and lodge them in the Gastonia jail for rioting .

The United Textile Workers ' Union is a branch of the American Federation of Labor . A contest for control had flared up between these two . The Communist organizers had fostered the Gastonia strike , which now was not moving rapidly enough toward victory to suit the strikers . The mills had hired other workers , continued partial operation . The strikers had grown hungry . Communist Organizers Fred Irwin Beal and George Pershing had dropped out of sight . Many an observer was ready to believe that the raid upon the Communist headquarters in Gastonia was made by disgruntled strikers , weary of the Communist leadership .
