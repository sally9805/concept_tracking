" Open Jails " The seriousness of the situation which has arisen because of the increased smuggling of aliens into the U. S. has aroused the Government to take harsher repressive measures . It is estimated by some that the number of smuggled immigrants is almost , if not quite , equal to the number of immigrants who enter by legal channels . <P> Recently , 31 Italians ( male ) were captured on Long Island , were charged with entering the country illegally . They were taken to Ellis Island on a deportation order , but the Government changed its mind . Handcuffed together , they were taken to a jail in Brooklyn and held in $10,000 bail each . The usual bail is $500 . They and the two men charged with smuggling them in are to be prosecuted under the Immigration Act and the Passport Act . These provide , in case of conviction , for an extreme penalty of 20 years in jail , $10,000 fine and deportation when the sentence is completed . The Italians vary in age from 17 to 57 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can foreigners be convinced that it does not pay to try to enter this country by the smugglers ' route . H. H. Curran , Immigration Commissioner at Ellis Island , issued a new watchword : " Open arms for honorable applicants for admission to this country ; open jails for dishonorable , smuggled aliens .
