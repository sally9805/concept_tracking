txt Traders and investors are buying the good rails on the theory that there can not possibly be any railroad legislation for at least a year , if then . One banker points out that prosperity of the country over the last 18 monthshas been largely due to purchases of products running into hundreds of millions of dollars by the railroads . The latter have been given a square deal and are able to buy because of good surpluses . Had the railroads been forced to reduce freight rates to an unreasonable level figures would have been in red ink . The public will not buy securities of companies that show deficits . And what is more corporations showing deficits can not maintain satisfactory wages . WILLIAM H. WOODIN Shareholders of the American Car &; Foundry Co. will be pleased with the news that William H. Woodin does not propose to resign as president of the corporation . No industrial enterprise has been more ably managed than American Car &Foundry.; With Woodin at the helm shareholders feel safe at all times , particularly in periods of extreme depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , and that Car &.; Foundry at times is lending money when many other corporations are borrowing . Generally speaking no industrial group has been better managed than the egaipment companies , including American Car &; Foundry , American Locomotive , Railway Steel Spring , Baldwin Locomotive and Lima Locomotive . The managements have been able to see ahead and today working capital , cash on hand , property valuation and book value are at new high records . During panics and business depressions over the last 25 years the managements of these companies refused to become panicky . They had arranged their houses for just such emergencies and had nothing to fear . The shareholders did not dump their shares on the market for the very good reason that they had confidence in the management . Seldom does a properly managed corporation get close to the rocks . CROWDED La Follette is getting a little crowded . His following is not to his liking . Reds , Soviets , Communists , Bolsheviks , Anarchists , bootleggers and other leaders in this class are rallying to his support and La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realizes he can never be elected with that kind of support . With his third party idea he is trying to modify his views on things in general . He realizes the people refuse to stand for radicalism let alone the more extreme views of Foster , Emma Goldman and their like . With red and black flies swarming to his support La Follette will soon be forced to put on a net . It has escaped very general notice that the famed Walsh report on the oil leases got into Congress in the closing days , and as a result the report is as dead as a door nail because the Senate did not vote on it If Walsh was so soon to be done for , whatever was he begun for ? He is reported to have cost the government about $500,000 . Gamblers , train robbers and bootleggers who wanted to get from the Pacific Coast or the midcontinent to Washington for their health wrote Walsh that they had a - story of terrible Republican corruption to unfold and would he please send the railroad fare and guarantee the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to make the trip and it was noted that while most of the witnesses who said they could prove this or that never proved anything , they appeared on the streets of Washington in a day or two in new overcoats and loud clothes , each with a clean shave and a Bryan haircut But it is now said that Brother Tom and Brother John will pass from the scene of activity in chasing leaseholders and both will have to support the Hon. W. G. himself no slouch in oil law , in the approaching Democratic convention . mascarros MAY GET RICH TIMM:Gilt Carnegie wanted to die poor , but at that found difficulty in properly placing his wealth while he lived as he was not beset with excessive taxes as is the case today . The inheritance tax intricacies keep multiplying year by year and soon the rich may have an even chance with the poor man in procuring the necessary pass from St. Peter . That the outstanding short interest in the market is still large is evident from a canvass of the Street . There has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been little-change in the position of the big bears . At least all have been ready to deny they had switched from the bear to the bull side . But there is probably something in the statement that they are endeavoring to reduce their short position with the assistance of bear propaganda . Most of the floor traders are now bullish . It was becoming more and more difficult to make money on the bear side . One trader says up to Wednesday he had been short of ten different stocks for two weeks and had not made money in any of them . Some of them declined a point or two , but on every drop , carne back rasickly . Seven of the stocks he was short of he covered at a loss of one to four points , ineluding commissions and taxes . TOBACCO SHARES There has been excellent buying of the Tobacco shares . Wednesday the activity and strength of Liggett &; Myer was due largely to buying by inside interests . It is ex ' pected 1924 will be a good year for the tobacco companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the anthracite coal companies . Record consumption this year should be in order . Consumers have been compelled to keep the fires burning when they should be manipulating fans . Factory production of automobiles has been sharply curtailed since the middle of May so ' as to permit dealers to work off surplus stocks of cars which are still , in mart cases , higher than at this time last year . A-further drop in monthly production for June may therefore be ex , pected . May output in excess of 301,000 vehicles was at the rate of 3.600,000 cars for the year . In 1923 . May output of nom : * was at the rate of 4,100,000 and actual output last year was just under this figure . As production for the first five months this year aggregated 1,750,000 vehicles , it is obvious that an average output of 250,000 cars monthly would bring total for the year to 3,500,000 vehicles . On this volume the industry should have a satisfactory year particularly as leading manufacturers , show a disposition to conserve profits by advancing prices rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has made former low prices possible . Altho gh there is some skepticism as to whether the higher p e levels can be maintained , the industry feels is t its ' policy of passing economies along to the committer through lower prices the past three years , while practically all other lines were advancing prices , has strengthened its position with the consuming public which has come to recognize the outstanding values offered in the automotive field . MAN CONTEST RICHMOND marowross CONTROL Many large preferred stockholders of Richmond Radiator are of the opinion that the company should in the near future do something towards clearing up the arrearage on their stock , which amounts to 70% or $1,070,777 . They believe that earnings for the past two years would justify the company in starting dividends on the preferred and taking care of the ' accumulated dividends in the shape of possibly a new  --  second preferred issue . It is intimated in certain circles that unless the present management takes some action between now and the next annual meeting a contest for control may . be instituted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of consideration the $1,070,777 now due on the preferred , this was equal to $12.78 a share on the 28,574 shares of common , after allowing for the payment of 7% on the 15,296 shares of the senior stock . ARMOUR .5 CO . Earnings of Armour &; Co. so far this year have been considerably in excess of what they were in the corresponding period of last year . HEARD ON THE STREET Cleveland Society note  --  The Old Guard was also present . Bricklayers are on a sympathy strike . One wonders where the sympathy is coming from . Now if the " tipping " bureaus only remain bearish we may have a genuine bull market . The bull is now stalking the bear . International Telephone &; Telegraph is lending at a premium . That bear interview of a big plunger on the eve of a big rise in the market was poorly timed . The market was strong with the exception of a few of the active issues that reacted moderately at the close . The floor of the Exchange is bullish . Large professionals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for continued strength .
