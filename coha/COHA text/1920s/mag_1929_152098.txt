Secretary of State Stimson last week found his desk strewn with vexatious matters appertaining to that troublesome , vermiform little neighbor , Cuba . As President Hoover 's foreign minister , Statesman Stimson had to keep abreast of Cuba 's internal disorders , of which several were stirring last week . Complaints centred chiefly about President Gerardo Machado . <P> President Coolidge paid a magnificent visit to President Machado in January , 1928 , when he journeyed in state to Havana to open the Pan-American Conference . Generous and flattering were President Machado 's attentions to President Coolidge . They became indeed the " great and good friends " of diplomatic parlance . Mr. Coolidge returned to Washington full of admiration and praise for Cuba and its president . Secretary of State Kellogg took his cue from the White House and anti-Machado agitators kept well under cover . <P> Herbert Hoover , as President-Elect skipped Cuba on his Latin-American tour this year . Significant or not , this omission was sufficient to bring out of the shadows all the anti-Machado agitators in the U. S. and to guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " something be done . " <P> For all its formal show of sovereign independence , Cuba remains a U. S. appendix , attached not only by trade and finance but semi-politically by the Platt Amendment . Said this provision ( tacked on to the 1901 Army Appropriation Bill and never since retracted ) : " The government of Cuba consents that the United States may exercise the right to intervene for the protection of Cuban independence , the maintenance of a government adequate for the protection of life , property and individual liberty . ... " It was under this authority that the U. S. Army occupied Cuba from 1906 to 1909 to suppress uprisings and restore constitutional government . On the theory that Cuban sovereignty can be suspended at will by the U. S. under the Platt Amendment , Secretary Stimson is being implored by anti-Machadoists to see the " unconstitutional " character of that president 's regime , the suppression of " individual liberty . " the lack of protection for " property . " <P> On this score Secretary Stimson last week had these things to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Citizen Joseph E. Barlow settled in Havana . He dreamed it might one day be a fashionable winter resort . He helped develop the Marianao residential district , laying water mains on the Cuban Government 's promise of reimbursement . He now claims that $122,000 is still owing on this account , that the Cuban Congress has appropriated the money , that President Machado has refused to pay him .
