txt " Lenin is not only right back on the job , but is as fit as a fiddle . I watched him for the best part of an hour today , and if he is a sick man , I never saw a well one , ' . ' said Oscar Cesare , the American artist , who managed to gain admittance to Lenin 's office in the Kremlin , a privilege rigidly denied to " interviewers . " Cesare was admitted to make sketches of the Soviet leader for the Sunday Magazine of THE NEW roalt TIDIES , on condition that he would not interrupt Lenin 's work . Telling of his interesting experience , Cesare said : " And you never saw any one working with such gusto . It made me think of tile way a man who has been denied his favorite dish by a doctor for a long time ; and then when at last he ' is allowed to eat it goes right ahead as if he had n't tasted food for a year . " Admission to Lenin 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the way was securely guarded . First the visitor must pass the military control at the Trotzky rite of the Kremlin , connected with the ace by a long bridge over the park . 13cneath a tower at the far end there is a second post . At the entrance to the building to the right of a big square , where Lenin 's apartment is situated . one 's pass must again be shown to ... he sentries . Generally there are a couple of guards on the second floor landing outside the apartment itself . Cesare was kept waiting only a few minutes in the great anteroom with its long council tables and two girl secretaries before Lenin 's personal secretary , whose name is Fotyewa , announced that he could enter a simple little room overlooking a courtyard where the man who holds Russia in a firmer grip than any Czar since Peter the Great was sitting hunched in a chair before a flat-topped desk covered with books and papers . Lenin as He Looks Today . Lenin rose and greeted his visitor with a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft white collar and black tie . His figure looked stocky and strong and , though his hair is more gray than red in his bristly moustache and small chin beard , his eyes were clear and bright , his face full of healtiycolor . The room was lined with a restful blue paper , harmonizing with a thick blue carpet . A felt door closed softly on well-oiled hinges , shutting Cesare into a quiet chamber in which there were no ornaments and no pictures on the walls save two prints or photographs , apparently of some meeting . Behind Lenin there was an open fireplace without a fire . On the desk in front of him there was the usual Swedish box telephone that is common in Russia , but with an automatic calling apparatus affixed , and a small signal lamp instead of calling bells . " Lenin stepped close up to me , smiling in a wonderfully attractive way , " said Cesare . " ' Sit where you please and make yourself comfortable , ' he said . ' excuse me if I go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you ? ' " ' Not in. the least , ' I answered , ' just go ahead as if I was n't here  --  they said I could stay for ten minutes . ' " ' Ten , twenty , just as you like , ' said Lenin . ( In point of fact I stayed fortyfive and then went of my own accord ) . ' Well , then I 'll go right on . ' " For a time he sat hunched up in a chair reading a Russian paper intently as if he would burn a hole in it . From start to finish he seemed utterly unconscious of my presence and absorbed in his work . Of course that is not literally true . After a short while he dropped the , newspaper and pressed a buzzer for his secretary . He asked her to bring some documents . While waiting he smiled at me and asked how I found Moscow . I replied I. had been much struck by the order of the city , the cheerful faces of the people and the busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here long ? ' he asked . " ' Two months , ' I replied . ' Two months , eh ? That 's good . And You got a good impression ? That 's fine . ' " I took advantage of the opportunity to say how interested in him people in America were , adding : ' You are as well known there as President Harding . Even those who do n't agree with you admit you are a big man . " " Only a Little Man . " " Lenin again smiled the genuine attractice smile . ? I am not a big man , ' he said , tapping himself on the breast . ' I 'm only a little man , ' and again he stepped toward me with an indescribably friendly air . " At that moment he reminded me immensely of Theodore Roosevelt ? the same magnetism , the same almost childish frankness and friendliness . He seemed much simpler than Lloyd George . When I sketched the latter at Genoa he spoke cleverly and epigramatically , as if wishing to make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , he is not cold like Poincard . Poincard struck me as being a man who though everything out at night carefully and logically . Lenin seemed intensely human and alive . Though his English is n't absolutely perfect , he was so on the qui vivo for what I said that he appeared to catch the sense of the words before they were hardly out of my mouth . " His secretary brought in some papers and at once , N. ceased to exist for Lenin . He studied the typewritten pages profoundly , then murmured the names of some of his principal subordinates . Still muttering ; he seized a telephone book and ran through the pages , repeating the number as if I were a thousand miles away . He pressed the figures on the automatic dial and got the connection . In all his actions there was nothing nervous , but , swift conservation of movement and energy that reminded me of films I had seen to teach avoidance of waste motion at machines . " While telephoning Lenin gave the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the subordinate , and gestured naturally and instinctively with his free hand . " Finally I told him I had got enough sketches and added I would make lithographs for reproduction to be sold in America for the benefit of starvingRUSslan children . For an instant Lenin did n't catch the word and I explained . ' Good , ' he said , ' good , I understand . ' I murmured something about political opinion in America . Yes , ' he replied . ' I 've just been reading this , ' and he held up a red bound copy of Pettygrew 's ' Plutocratic Democracy . ' It 's a very fine book , ' and his eyes sparkled as he looked down at it . I got the impression that Lenin did n't admire the American political system as much as he admired the book . "
