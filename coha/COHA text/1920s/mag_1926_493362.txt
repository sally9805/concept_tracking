bow time after time the movies took their masters and stood them on their heads . Famous Players ? the very name ? is an example . The original intention , which brought over Sarah Bernhardt in Queen Elizabeth , was to present famous players of the stage in famous plays from the stage ; and the result was that a little blonde , almost unknown on the stage , became the mainstay of Famous Players , defeat ? ing the great names and asserting in practice ( and popular ? ity ) the independence of the films . That was Mary Pick-ford . The fact that it took the movies some ten years to learn the lessons she taught them may also be noted . The disproportion in Mr. Ramsaye 's book is purely edit ? orial . Roughly one-half of it deals with the invention of the projector and camera ; the story is written with animation ; it has journalistic skill ; it marshals the evidence persuasively in favor of Thomas A. Edison not as the sole inventor of the moving picture apparatus , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the one apparatus upon which all future apparatus was based . ( Whether the French and English claimants will tear down the plaques they have put up , is problematical . ) Too much , however , is made of this part of the story ; the rest , the fantastic stories of the ignorant and the inspired who went into the movies , for money and for fun , is the better portion . The acci ? dents and litigations , the stories of privations and millions , are all entertaining ; as the book is critical only by irnplica- , tion , it does not clearly sketch the great lines of develop ? ment ; one has to mark for oneself the changes from early trick movies to ' Westerns , from ' Westerns to serials , and so on through the feature film and the spectacle . The first bill put on at 66 Fifth Avenue , New York , seems to me to achieve perfection . It is , oddly enough , the same bill , in essentials , that I saw in Paris three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boulevards and attracted a general , not a special , audience . There was , this time , an interesting short subject dealing with the Parasol Ants ( in Paris the Soviet ice-breaker film , the best short subject I have ever seen , took this place ) , then , without any " presentation " whatever , Caligari and Chap ? lin 's A Dog 's Life and a badly cut version of Beaumont 's abstract movie . The ' virtues of these films separately are now known ; the virtue of putting them together , of afford ? ing a movie evening in which every item gave pleasure , most of it legitimate moving picture pleasure , is to be remarked . It is to be remarked also that the venture was a success ; the small theatre was crowded ; profits were taken in . Here , to stick to my text , the notable dispro ? portion was between the goodness of the program and the smallness of the theatre ; if the movies are good for any ? thing , there must be in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good movie fare . Raoul Walsh 's direction of What Price Glory ? shows a great many influences . The old Griffith touch , the von Stroheim touch , the King Vidor touch ? all of them could have been used without inviting comparison ; but Mr. Walsh , elsewhere inventive and interesting , let these in ? fluences appear in bits which repeated the bits of his mod ? els . A mooning love-sick soldier posed exactly as Griffith 's soldier did in The Birth of a Nation ; the pigs from the Merry Widow reappeared as geese , but precisely in the same positions and with the same effect . The fact that The Big Parade came first and was in the same tone , made What Price Glory ? a parallel , not an achievement ; it had the same high moment as the earlier film : the advance of the Marines through the barrage ; comparing a film seen last week with one seen last year , I think the new one is better ; the effect of the men marching under the trees ( overprinting possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point stressed in the film is the use of profanity , not in the titles , but on the visible lips of the characters . This is not important . The rowdiness and immorality of the earlier scenes , quite freely and refresh ? ingly done , is more than corrupted by the sentimentality of the central story ? exactly what Stallings and Anderson wanted not to do in the play has been done in the film . THE study of demonology has nowadays fallen into neglect . The demons are a dwindling race and , since the abandonment of Hell , we can no longer expect the subject to excite the same interest as in the past , when it so often commanded the attention of the ablest and most brilliant minds . Modern writers such as Huysmans , Poe and Algernon Blackwood who have dealt at all with the demon world have done so rather from the point of view of its picturesque or startling possibilities as material for fiction than in the thoughtful and thorough-going spirit of Sinistrari or Cotton Mather . It may , however , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status of the devils and to describe their habits and activities as . they appear in our own day : the writer has enjoyed unu ? sual opportunities for observing them ? has even , during certain periods , lived among them ( from necessity and much against his taste ) ; and he has made a special effort to un ? derstand them and to ascertain their characters . These notes are presented with no attempt to exploit the sen ? sational possibilities of the subject , but merely as a socio ? logical sketch of these beings as I have found them in their everyday pursuits and in their ordinary relations . It does , as I have intimated , require a special effort , on the part of a human being , to understand the demon char ? acter . We are so much in the habit of interpreting the behavior of the non-human creatures we encounter in terms of human nature ; it is so easy for us to ascribe human motives to the inhabitants of the supernatural world , who have often a superficial resemblance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards as ourselves . But , . if we approached them as we approach the animals , we should be less likely to misunderstand them ? or rather , since the animals do share with us some primitive emo ? tions and instincts , we should do better to bring to them the same point of view as to the entities of chemistry and phys ? ics , whose reactions leave us perfectly unmoved . In any case , we must remember that the devils are in everything abso ? lutely unhuman and that nothing we know of human con ? duct can throw any light upon them . When I say that the devils are unhuman , I do not mean merely that they are without human institutions or that their society differs from ours , though both these things are - true . Since the banishment of their emperor , Satan , and the disbanding of the infernal host , deprived at once of a country and a leader , they have had neither politics or religion . The old religious spirit of Hell , which has in its time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art , is today practically dead : without a god which his worshipers can figure as at once carnal like themselves and divine , there can no longer be a cult ; and without a cult , there can be no religion , in any real sense of the word . As for politics , Mr. Cabell has said that Hell is a democracy ; but this is no longer true : it is more nearly an anarchy . The devils still legislate , or rather , a few of them do ; but the others pay no attention to the laws and , indeed , rarely know what they are . Nor do the devils ever vote . An occasional attempt is made by some eloquent fiend with a gift for demagogy to lead a movement for the restoration of Hell ; and it is some ? times possible , on these occasions , to arouse considerable numbers of demons , who parade back and forth with torches , uttering concerted cheers . ( Their cheering sounds rather like our college yells , but is strident , mechanical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the sight of a hold-up , an unexpected murder or a pair of dogs at the street-corner is enough to divert them from their crusade . They have , in fact , never , even in the great days of Hell , been capable of real devotion to an ideal , but only of a sort of mob fury , which Satan had the power of exciting : the cooperative spirit , the foresight , the idealism and the dis ? cipline which are the accompaniments of human enterprise , whether in politics , religion or business , are quite unknown in the demon world . The devils are essentially individ ? ualists : each is simply out for himself . They are , there ? fore , utterly indifferent to others , not only in their rela ? tions to human beings , but also among themselves . Their instincts are all mischievous and maleficent . We are in the habit , on this account , of censoring their actions as perverse ; but this is to impute to them a moral intention of - which they are altogether innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and benevolence are to us . When we see a demon befouling a public place , spitting at a person who has been run over by a motor ? car or kicking a man who has been arrested by the police and is powerless to defend himself , we are not td con ? clude that these acts are inspired by anything properly describable as malignancy , but rather that they are corn-parable to reflex actions , as when one 's leg twitches at being hit below the knee . This is what I mean when I say the devils are unhuman and that it is difficult for human beings to understand them . It is perhaps particularly in their sexual relations that the subhumanity of the devils strikes us . These relations are entirely undignified by the loyalty , the high ecstasy and the romance characteristic of human relations . Many of the demons do not function sexually ; but , among those that do ? notably , the succubm and incubi ? their matings are wholly physical and transient and involve neither re ? sponsibility nor affection . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range is not perhaps disposed to con ? sider this unnatural . The more hideous and monstrous types have died out , like the larger and more powerful ; and such a bestial and complex creation as the visage as ? sumed by Satan in Diirer 's well known engraving would probably be impossible today . The demons have been un ? dergoing a process of standardization and are growing more and more alike every year . Thus , one sees curious modified forms of the pig or the crocodile snout ; and where a devil has originally been provided with two faces , the second situated on his buttocks , the unnatural face is seen to have atrophied and its features to be slowly disappearing . Such highly specialized types of demons as are to be seen in the admirable studies of Breughel and Callot are almost impossible to find nowadays : they were the products of a highly civilized society and have no longer any place among the nomadic and outlaw people which the demons have become . A being modeled merely as an obscene parody upon royalty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America at least , where the former of these callings does not exist and where the latter provide their own parodies and make the demons , in comparison , seem imposing ; such devils , in another category , as those which consisted of some single organ of the body endowed sim ? ply with a pair of frog 's legs or of bat 's wings have proved unable to survive : they depended upon the protection of a court and have no way of coping with the modern world . Yet the demons which have endured to our day are still sufficiently unsightly and grotesque , and in a sufficient variety of different ways , to appear repulsive to human taste as objects of amorous desire and unviable even to each other . We do not wonder when a female demon , coming straight from the embraces of a male , makes no scruple of jeering and spitting at him in the presence of other female demons or in the presence of another male ; or when a male , who has been living intimately with a female , makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the devils are so inveterately addicted ? throwing her into the water , robbing and leaving her or hacking off her arms and legs . We should , however , be quite wrong in supposing that the demons resent each oth ? er 's ugliness : being entirely without ideas of beauty , they are , in consequence , impervious to ugliness and do not even , as has sometimes been supposed , esteem it for its own sake . The demons exchange , in their amorous intercourse , in a manner not unlike ours , pledges of lasting affection and epithets of tender endearment ; but these expressions are simple accompaniments of the physical instinct itself and as involuntary as it ; they attach no significance to them and we should wrong them in supposing they do . The devils are sterile and unable to reproduce their kind ; and neither the desire to have children nor the necessity of providing for their future enters into their considerations . The fiends have a highly developed literature which ad ? mirably reflects their habits and ideas . It is mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around from hand to hand ; and it consists principally of obscene anec ? dotes and stories of atrocious crime . We must , however , bear in mind , in connection with this literature , that to the demons , whose point of view is so incomprehensible to ours , a scandal is not a scandal , nor a crime a crime the former they enjoy as a farce and the latter as a prac ? tical joke . They have an interesting school of poetry , of which the leader is Blashtalatshk . I have met Blashtalatshk and found him a devil of high intelligence . His horns are rudimentary and his lower jaw is lacking ; but his enormous black eyes are among the wildest I have ever seen . His poetry and that of his fellows is , of course , entirely devoid of the moral ideas and the passionate and noble emotions which distinguish human poetry today : it is exclusively occupied with the representation of sights , sounds , smells and sensations , which the demons recreate with great vivid ? ness and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoherence . These sensations are not , to be sure , those which give pleasure to human be ? ings , but , in most cases , directly the opposite ; yet we must remember that the attraction of a devil toward a sewer or a piece of carrion is as natural as that of a human being toward Horace 's fons Bandusim or Waller 's lovely rose . I will , however , quote an example of demon poetry ( from Blashtalatshk himself ) which can give no offense to human taste : One of the most interesting figures in demon literature , however , is the poet Prezzbo Brox , who has developed sensibilities so alien to his race as almost to give him an affinity with humanity . He has always , on this account , been regarded by his fellows as abnormal and treated with suspicion . Some years ago , he withdrew altogether from the society of devils and took up his abode in the ground with a mole , for which he had conceived a sentiment resembling affection . One of his omnipresent compatriots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set a mole-trap for the mole and killed it . Prezzbo 's chagrin over this tragedy was striking and some of the finest of his lyrics were inspired by it . I translate an example , which will certainly be appreciated more easily by human beings than by demon readers : At first , however , infuriated by the murder , Prezzbo had rushed out at once from his tunnel , pursued and captured the guilty demon and nailed him down to the floor of an old barn , where he compelled him to swallow a gallon of prussic acid . Demons are practically indestructible , but more easily affected by chemicals than by violence . In this case , though the victim was not destroyed , his internal organs were mostly eaten away : he was never able to talk again , but could only utter a low croak , and his mental faculties were thought to have been impaired . Prezzbo afterwards felt the acutest remorse for his relapse into demon nature : through the special development of his moral sensibility , what seemed amusing and proper to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this incident ) came to present itself to Prezzbo as degrad ? ing and horrible . In his revulsion of feeling at what he had done , he composed one of the longest and most im ? pressive of his poems , which afforded the author himself much relief and which has been greatly admired by those demons sufficiently cultivated to appreciate the exquisite art of a production of which the subject is unintelligible to them . It might be thought that the demons , with their detach ? ment and their capacity for purely intellectual development , should have distinguished themselves in the field of science ; but they are too restless and capricious . The continuous application required for scientific study is impossible to them . I have said that the devils were a diminishing race ; but they are not perhaps without their importance for us hu ? mans . They have , it is true , been dispossessed of their domain and their principal strength is , therefore , broken ; but , for this very reason , we have them more constantly with us , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period in the past , when they were dwelling se ? curely in Hell . Since the War , in particular , finding us demoralized and weakened , they have been prompt to take advantage of our plight ; and one is forced all too often nowadays to recognize the traces of their activity or influ ? ence . This is deplorable ; and all the more , that the , suc ? cess of these anti-social beings should follow on an event which called into play , in their purest and most dazzling form and on a scale probably unprecedented , the heroic capacity for cooperative effort and the triumphant ideal ? ism of humanity .
