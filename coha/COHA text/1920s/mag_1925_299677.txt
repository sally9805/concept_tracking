THE SPRING FLIGHT-Lee J. Smits-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . When geese went north in the night , when lurid shafts of light played in a forbidden alley , when girls looked longingly at his curly , black hair , Kenneth Farr of the Middle West could not help feeling that there was more in life than his mother had told him about between family prayers . When he grew older and found he was right , he pitied himself for not having been told ; posed alternately as " misunderstood " and " no good . " As is usual in such cases , he wrote bad verse . He sought liberation on the stage , in journalism , in writing advertising ; but found it only , invariably , in willing women . Eventually that escape became familiar ; unnecessary . Kenneth settled into his harness , comfortably drawing a wife and two children . Another account of mediocrity in search of an image deserves attention only because Author Smits can , indubitably , write .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
