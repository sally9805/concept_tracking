It was just the sort of argument that one would expect to hear if an average U. S. daycoach should be stalled between stations and a better-than-average red-faced Irish-American started talking loudly . <P> In the House of Representatives , the loud one was Representative James A. Gallivan of Massachusetts , whose specialty is alliterative abuse . Quoth he at the beginning of last week : " . . . Prohibition , its proconsuls , parasites , and plug-uglies . . , . has even reserved to itself and its allies a monopoly of murder-murder without penalty . The right to murder Americans abroad without fear or favor , it delegates to bandit organizations ; the right to murder Americans at home by poisonous liquors remains with the Anti-Saloon League and its allied bootleggers , and the right to wreck and drown American sailors and shoot up foreign seamen goes to its rum cruisers . <P> " Floggings , gougings , and arson are the special privileges of prohibition 's standing army-the Knights of the Nightshirt. . . " etc. , etc . <P> As usually happens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon ( next day ) everyone was joining in . The Representative train , en route to supply moneys for the Treasury and Post Office Departments , but stalled by a proposed amendment to prohibit poisonous denaturants in industrial alcohol , became clamorous . The amendment had been offered by Representative John Charles Linthicum of Maryland , who cited the facts that 10% of all industrial alcohol in the U. S. has annually been leaking into beverage channels under Prohibition ; that there were 11,700 deaths in 1926 from poisonous alcohol . <P> Up stood Michigan 's Cramton to say : " It is interesting to me to see what the policy is to be of the wet block in the House as presented by its newly chosen leader , the gentleman from Maryland . The policy of our other friend from Maryland , John Philip Hill , was to destroy the Eighteenth Amendment by authorizing beer and wine , but it is apparent that the gentleman from Maryland Mr. Linthicum , the new leader , has on his banner , ' Hamstring enforcement in any way we can do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to talk : " Mr. Chairman and gentlemen , I am as ' Wet ' as any man in this House . . . . What we as ' Wets ' ought to do ... is . . . insist upon the Prohibition Bureau having sufficient men , appropriating enough money . ... If the American people want Prohibition ... it will cost them anywhere from $200,000,000 to $250,000 , 000 . ... " <P> Florida 's Green : " Will the gentleman yield ? " <P> La Guardia : " No . I do not yield to the gentleman from Florida . Florida is so happily situated near the West Indies that you can get all the pure liquor you want and it is hypocritical to take any stand as to law enforcement . " <P> <P> Green : " Florida will always take the stand of upholding the laws of our Nation . . . . <P> La Guardia : " And there are more Prohibition lawbreakers in the gentleman 's State , in proportion to population than there are in my State !
