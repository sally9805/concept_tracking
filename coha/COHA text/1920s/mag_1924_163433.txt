The versatile press adapts itself to almost everything . Along came the radio , and there sprang into existence radio supplements and radio programs . But until recently , although radio had developed into one of the larger amusements of the nation , there had developed no seasoned attempt at radio criticism . <P> The New York Tribune took this omission to heart . It set up last week a department called Last Night on the Radio , conducted by " Pioneer . " He does not tell how to wind a deduction , or how to make a radio set out of a hair pin , a toothbrush and the spare parts of three Fords . Neither does he merely recite " today 's program , " although a program appears with his department . But in a series of short paragraphs he criticizes the manner and the substance of the programs on which he listened in the night before : <P> " Lieutenant Hinton 's talk about the NC4 flight was not altogether interesting for those of us who are favored with good memories . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if WJZ was not . ' News while news is newsy ' is our motto here at the Trib . <P> " That set of Corean automobile rules read off to us from WEAF was interesting . For those who detuned : ' Ring your horn , ' ' speed slowly . ' <P> " For Chopin we are thankful . For Felian Garzia ( WJZ ) to play his compositions for us we are also thankful . We have been listening in for three long years and it is saying a lot when we place this program on our long-to-be-remembered list . WJZ , is n't there some way of giving Mr. Garzia a key to the studio ? " <P> There is a long way to go from Pioneer 's paragraphing to a school of radio criticism . But then , his name is Pioneer . The Tribune professed to be very well pleased with the reception of its innovation .
