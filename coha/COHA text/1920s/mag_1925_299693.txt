The Loening Amphibians to be used in the MacMillan expedition ( TIME , Apr. 20 ) passed their tests last week , after a highly satisfactory flight from Mitchel Field , L.I. , to the Naval Air Station at Anacostia , Washington , D.C , and were formally accepted . In acceptance trials , the OL-1 , as the Amphibian is officially designated , attained a height of 14,000 ft , made a speed of 125 mi. per hour and climbed more than 5,000 ft. in ten minutes . Fully loaded , the plane weighs 5,200 lb. , and carries a crew of four men . With its inverted engine giving the pilot clear vision ahead ; its retractible gear allowing the plane to alight on ship deck , on land , on sea , or to roll up a beach under its own power ; with its photographic , wireless and heating arrangements , the Loening is the last word in airplane construction .
