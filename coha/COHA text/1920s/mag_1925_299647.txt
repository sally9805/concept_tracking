Some time after May 5 , the S.S. Pellegrini , big French tramp steamer , left her native waters . She slipped clumsily across the ocean , arrived , last week , at Rum Row . She was heavily laden . It may have been as much as 50,000 cases of liquor that she carried . <P> During the past four years , the value of a case at Rum Row has averaged between $20 and $25 . Assuming the Pellegrini carried only 10,000 cases a mere 75-ft. schooner will carry 5,000-the value of her cargo would approximate a quarter of a million dollars . <P> Her crew set busily to work , preparing the cases for delivery over the ship 's sides . Occasionally , a mate would gaze expectantly over the waters , looking for the swift little rum runner which would surely come . Hours passed . Then , suddenly , four small motor craft raced into sight , came up to the Pellegrini , but not alongside . They circled around and around-picket boats of the U. S. Coast Guard . <P> The Pellegrini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until this new official nonsense might cease . But , a few days later , she was visited by a Coast Guard vessel on inspection , was notified that war had begun . Her crew offered a case of champagne for a package of cigarets , but the contract was not concluded . <P> A German steamer , half unloaded , decided to leave Rum Row a fortnight ago . Last week , she returned . No rummies came to her side . Two indefatigable picket boats greeted her . Surly , she departed once more . <P> What has happened ? <P> In accordance with announcements made in March , there were assembled in the waters of the middle Atlantic , early in May , a score of revenue cutters ( Customs Service ) , a dozen submarine chasers ( borrowed from the U.S. Navy ) and nearly 100 picket boats and larger vessels belonging to the U.S. Coast Guard under the command of Rear Admiral Billard . All these vessels were put at the disposal of General Lincoln C. Andrews , recently appointed Assistant Secretary of the Treasury ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the general supervision of Secretary Mellon . <P> On May 5 , this armada took up a position on Rum Row-a line running about 200 miles from Southwest to Northeast , about 30 miles offshore from Atlantic City , N.J. , to New London , Conn . <P> Along this line were found about 90 vessels , steam and sail , engaged in liquor traffic . One or more U. S. vessels placed themselves a few yards from each of the smugglers . It became impossible for the smugglers to unload their cargoes into launches ( " rummies " ) , with the result that the launches stayed idly at their docks along the shore . <P> By last week , all but ten or twelve of the 90 laden vessels left the Row . <P> Contributing quite as much to this result as the presence of the armada itself was the presence of a bolder , more ferocious spirit . Hitherto , U. S. vessels have sighted rum runners scurrying to shore , have urged them to stop , have even fired a wild shot . But the rum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply scurried on . The Coast Guard seamen have not been shooting with intent to kill . <P> When the May war was undertaken , it was made quite clear that if a rum launch would not stop when warned , every attempt would be made to blow it out of the water . Thus rum running became something more than risking a doubtful fine or a short imprisonment-it came to mean the risk of life .
