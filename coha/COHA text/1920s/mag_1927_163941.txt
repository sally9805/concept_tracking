" Read your Bible , if you have not done it before , and you will find hundreds of passages relative to the Divine Being which any moral and honest man would be ashamed to have appended to his character . <P> " The God of the Bible is depicted as one who ... cursed a snake , sewed skins together for clothes , preferred the savory smell of roast cutlets to the odors of boiled cabbage ; who sat in a burning bush or popped out from behind the rocks . <P> " This irate old God who thunders imprecations from the mountain or mutters and grouches in the tabernacle , and whom Moses finds so hard to tame ; who , in his paroxysms of rage , has massacred hundreds of thousands of his own chosen people , and would often have slaughtered the whole lot if cunning old Moses had n't kept reminding him of ' what will the Egyptians say about it ? ' makes one feel utter contempt for the preachers and unfeigned pity for the mental state of those who can retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whims , freaks and fancies . " <P> Thus wrote recently , in Toronto one Ernest V. Steiry , editor of newly established atheist weekly Christian Inquirer . Last week he was arrested , charged with " blasphemous , indecent and profane libel of and concerning the holy scriptures and the Christian religion . " In vain he pleaded : " I was not writing of the Christian God but the God ' of the Jews . " <P> Referring to the case , Crown Attorney ( Prosecutor ) Eric Armour said sternly : " One may attack the Christian religion if one does so in decent reasonable language ; but publications which in an indecent spirit asperse Christianity or the Scriptures , and do so in a language calculated and tended to shock the feelings and outrage the belief of mankind , are held to be liable to prosecution . ' <P> Jailed , Atheist Sterry , a short , mild , slim man , was able to turn $1,000 bail within a few hours , was thereupon released . Blinking diffidently at newsgatherers he said a toneless voice : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do believe in Heaven or Hell ; I do believe in the Bible as the inspired work of a God . All I know is that we are on this earth . The one thing we can do here is try overcome the forces of nature in order to make it a better place for the generations that come after us . " <P> Straightway the Rationist ( Atheist ) Society of Canada , Inc. announced that its entire resources would be expended , if neceessary , on the defense of Mr. Sterry . Only twice in Canadian history has a blasphemy charge of this nature been upheld .
