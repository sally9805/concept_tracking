The Lord Justice of Appeal , Sir John Eldon Bankes , presided last week over an Extraordinary Tribunal appointed by joint action of both Houses of Parliament to enquire into the circumstances of an examination by police officers at New Scotland Yard of a young woman , aged 22 , who is by profession a tester of radio tubes . The motion defining the scope of the Tribunal was drafted jointly by the Attorney General , Sir Thomas Inskip , the Home Secretary , Sir William Joynson-Hicks and Sir John Simon , highest feed British barrister and august Chairman of the Indian Statutory Commission ( TIME , Jan. 30 ) . As the Tribunal sat , last week , the small gallery was crammed with smartest folk , including Margot , famed Countess of Oxford and Asquith . In the House of Commons Right Honorable Members repeatedly referred to the actions of the Scotland Yard Police as constituting a " Shame ! ( Hear ! Hear ! ) " and a " DAMNABLE SHAME ! ( Cheers ! ) . " <P> In a word the police were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulb tester to a scandalous third degree . She , Miss Irene Savage , a cheerful , comely girl , was recently arrested and acquitted of the charge of " indecent conduct " in Hyde Park with Sir Leo Chiozza Money , 58 , onetime Parliamentary Secretary to.David Lloyd George . In dismissing the case the judge severely rebuked the constables concerned and fined them jointly 10 ( $48 ) . The astounding and scandalous aftermath came a fortnight later when Miss Savage was called upon at her place of work by Inspector Clark and Policewoman Wilde who imperatively insisted that she accompany them to New Scotland Yard for further questioning with regard to the charge of which she had been acquitted . <P> In this connection Sir Leo Chiozza Money sent a most significant open letter to the press last week : " I myself was asked to go to Scotland Yard in the same way . I escaped Miss Savage 's unpleasant experience because I happen to know , as few people do , that the police powers are not all that they pretend to be . My solicitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer any questions they put to me at his office in front of him , but that I would not go to Scotland Yard . This offer was not accepted . " <P> Miss Savage , frightened , ignorant of her rights , went with the police . What happened was elicited , last week , before the Extraordinary Tribunal , while the Lord Justice of Appeal listened in his great sweltering wig and the Countess of Oxford and Asquith cocked an ear . Chief points : <P> The period of Miss Savage 's examination was 5 hours . No policewoman was present . She was alone with Inspector Collins and a male shorthand stenographer . She was told that " there 's a lot more we want to know about this case , " and that the constables who were fined for falsely arresting her " are respectable men with good police records and besides their wives have got to be considered . " Inspector <P> Collins showed a tendency to shout , " We know that already ! " and " Do n't lie to us ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this tea was served . Ensuing dialogue : <P> Inspector Collins ( noting that there is only one spoon ) : " Irene 'll spoon with me , wo n't you , Irene ? " <P> Miss Savage ( tired ) : " No. "
