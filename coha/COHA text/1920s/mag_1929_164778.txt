Death last month took John Gardner Murray , Presiding Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church . Bishop Murray left a will . But strangely unlike the bequest of a prince of the Church was this last testament . No hospital or needy mission gained by the primate 's death . All his estate Bishop Murray left to his wife ; there were no bequests to charities . <P> But Bishop Murray left a letter too . It said : " The reason that no bequests are made by me to agencies or persons other than my own immediate family is because during my entire income-earning existence I have consistently and continuously given one-fifth ( 20% ) of my income from all sources to church , charity and collateral relatives . " <P> Bishop Murray , supererogatory chari-tarian , had doubly tithed.
