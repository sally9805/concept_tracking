RHYTHM , more than anything else , is the factor responsible for such success as I have had as a football coach . Its proper application in team play is the foundation of all successful football . The coach who succeeds in instilling a sense of rhythm into his squad has more than half won his coaching battle . Practically every successful physical effort is rhythmic , from the swing of the blacksmith 's sledge to the movements of varsity oarsmen . There can be no grace of motion without rhythm , and there can be no muscular coordination without graceful motion . It ' does n't matter what sort of athlete you visualize , whether the aesthetic dancer , the boxer , the golfer , the swimmer , the baseball pitcher , the pole vaulter , the tennis player , the skater , or the fleet halfback on a football team ; rhythm of motion is inseparable from their achievements . The slow motion camera discloses the rhythm beyond question . Timed unison in thinking and acting gives eleven eager men on a football team an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinate the actions of individuals into team rhythm . It is one of the most essential qualities of a successful football team , both as an offensive and as a defensive measure . I have proved this , time and again , during my years of coaching at Iowa and at Dartmouth . It is an engineering fact ? and an obvious one ? that eleven light men , timing their motions with an exactness that enables the eleven to hit the opposing line as one man , can smash through much heavier opponents with an ease that would be utterly impossible if the shock of attack were untimed , unsynchronized , without rhythm . Of course the heavier the rhythmical team the greater the shock of attack . The speed of the rhythm is an important secret of success . It is easy to demonstrate that an object weighing 200 pounds can be much further deflected by a man weighing 150 after a run of fifty yards iii six seconds than by a man who weighs 200 pounds , but who takes twelve seconds to reach the same object from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself rather easily by raising your foot to a certain height and letting it drop to the floor iu definite rhythm , then cut the time of the rhythm in half and see how much more power there is the stroke . There has been no change in weight , no change in distance from the floor ; only a change iii time of rhythm . Possibly the best example of the value of rhythm in football I can cite is a play made by Dartmouth in the Chicago game last year . Dartmouth kicked off to Chicago . Our ends , of course , went down with the ball . A Chicago player tried for it , but missed . The ball struck his headgear and bounded toward Sage , of Dartmouth . Now remember , every Dartmouth player was acting in timed unison rhythm . SAGE saw the break , knew that if he broke rhythm and tried for it , he probably would recover the ball for Dartmouth . but lie knew also that the Dartmouth line was three and four strides behind him , and that Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would throw Parker 's playing off if he broke unison . By count , Sage continned his play , which was to get his man out of the way for Parker , so the latter could get the ball and get away with it . Sage did just that . Rather than break the perfect team rhythm , Sage passed up an opportunity to grandstand . He undoubtedly could have recovered the ball , and just possibly might not have been downed in his tracks . But he knew , without once turning his head to see , that Parker was in rhythm and that Parker would be on the ball at the exact instant Sage was blocking the Chicago player , while the Dartmouth line was getting into action . The result was that Parker ran thirty yards for a touchdown . But , before going more definitely into an analysis of rhythm , I think it proper in any discussion concerning the creation of an outstanding college football eleven  | to begin with fundamental necessities . From that standpoint , I should say that the most vital factor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first duty of a football coach is to steep himself and his staff in the tradition of the school ? the honor for which his eleven will fight in play . It also is tremendously important to fan undergraduate and alumni support and enthusiasm into active , hot flame . For this support and enthusiasm drives a sense of responsibility into the men on the squad . The story of school tradition becomes a thing to be cherished , semisacred ; and there is born the vigorous determination to live up to its lofty standards . AFEW years ago , in 1919 to be exact , we had an outstanding illustration of the loyalty that turns defeat into victory . Dartmouth was playing one of the strongest teams in the East . The game opened with a touchdown against Dartmouth from the kick-off . A fast man got the ball and our eleven was n't fast enough to get him . To make matters worse , three minutes later a Dartmouth man fumbled , and our opponents made another touchdown . Dartmouth was not good enough to beat that team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? called his team together and hammered tradition into it ; called on those boys to demonstrate their right to wear the green jersey , an emblem for so many generations . The result was that that team went back into play with a dash and vigor that I had never seen it display ? and won the game . Given a background of tradition , the successful football coach then must turn to the systematic planning of team structure , as well as team development . The basis of team structure may be summarized by the phrases : " thorough understanding of the game , " and " intelligent playing . " Each player should be analyzed for the following inherent qualities , listed in order of their importance : 1 . Courage 2 . Physical skill 3 . Mental capacity ( a ) Ability to understand theory of plan and its details ( b ) Fast decisions ; initiative ( c ) Coordination of brain and brawn WE , AT Dartmouth , call our department of psychology to our aid . No two of the men on a football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his staff of psychologists enables him to bring about the proper reaction from each of his men when the occasion for it demands . The psychologist also aids the coach in summing up a candidate 's native ability to coordinate brain and muscle . Definite tests have been evolved at Dartmouth . I could not , in loyalty , disclose all of these , but I can safely cite one of the simpler and yet important ones . The candidate is placed before the coach , face to face , with the psychologist acting as a sort of referee . " Follow my words , not my movements , " explains the coach . " Hands on hips ; hands on shoulders ; hands on head . " hands on head . " But the coach places hands on hips or shoulders instead of head . That simple test in brain and muscle coordination ? quick thinking and quick telegraphy of thought to muscles ? ha ? sounded the death knell of hope for many otherwise well-fitted candidates . The importance of such coordination has been displayed strikingly by Princeton on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much emphasis is placed on the fact that in every football game there is a loose ball , and Princeton players must take advantage of every loose ball . Sam White displayed its value very nicely in 1919 when , in games with Harvard andYale , he grabbed the loose balls for winning touchdowns , and repeated . against Harvard in 1920 . Courage , the great self-effacing heart of a man , that is vital . Without courage , intellectual capacity , brawn , skill ? all sink into nothingness . Two years ago Larry Leavitt , Dartmouth fullback , gave a striking illustration of what sheer courage will do . We had gone up against a team that displayed unexpected ability . Leavitt was nct in the best physical shape , and we were holding him back for what we considered a more important game . Toward the end of the last half , however , the score was a nothing-to-nothing tie , and the ball was in our possession in the middle of the field . LEAVITT begged to be sent in . He was . With him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' line ? just one . Again and again Leavitt plunged through that spot . Hurt , tired and battered , he would n't quit . Every time he hit he gained from three to four yards ; never more ; never less . With tears in his eyes , but with joy and tremendous courage iii his heart , he fought on until he had gnashed his way across the goal linewinning the game for Dartmouth . With a team structure composed of men who possess the fundamental qualities that I have outlined , the coach is in position to develop a championship team . The remainder is up to him . Taking his men as individuals into consideration , cataloguing the maximum abilities of each , the coach then must plan the football possibilities for them . Perhaps he finds that the team he has selected from the material that is available is lighter in weight than any other team represented on the forthcoming schedule . If so , his plan of play must be formulated in accordance with the utmost that can be derived from his squadmaximum possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of timing of play , or rhythm , enters largely into the calculation . OF COURSE , the greatest possible speed of rhythm should be developed , and the lighter the team , the greater the team speed must be , and the more accurate . Very seldom do you see a heavy team display as much speed as a lighter one is capable of showing , and that is what gives the lighter team a more even chance when heavily outweighed ? speed of rhythm . That can be understood by recalling the reported effect of the Charleston on dance floors ; compared with the fox trot , or one-step . Both the fox trot and the one-step are rhythmic . They ca n't be anything else ; but the rhythmic beat in those dances is different , slower , than the succession of beats in the Charleston . It is the difference in the beat timing that puts a dangerous strain on dance floors when a group engages in the Charleston . Proper timing , or rhythm , also enables  | every man on the team to jump into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being put into play . And that is a tremendous advantage . It is the futile effort to do that very thing by players who are not taught properly that results in off-side playing , and consequent penalties . Coordination of rhythmic thought and action prevents off-side play . Mere rhythm of motion will not do it . Exact timing of thought with ac tion s absolutely necessary . The way in which that co ordination is brought about . if the player is capable of accomplishing such coordination , is through speed ? speed of every action in practice or in play . When I put my men through practice I invariably demand , and force , speed , top speed , for it is only when maximum individual speed is being employed that the proper timing of team play can be brought about . OF COURSE it is not possible for each player to have the same speed capacity ? some are slower , some are faster . The coach then must make his plan of play in accordance with individual speed as well as group speed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover in order to arrive at their objective , but they are put where their top speed must be exerted . In the diamond formation , for instance , the man who is at the line tangent of that formation is slower than the men who are back of him . But because all of them have practiced and learned that play at top speed , and timed speed , they deliver their full force in exact unison . Another phase of playing that is dominated by rhythmic coordination of mind and muscle is the catching of punts . A fumbled punt almost always is the result of self-consciousness on the part of the player . In his effort to catch the ball he suddenly becomes conscious of his opponents thundering down upon him , or some other factor may enter into the play that makes him mentally conscious of his effort and so disturb the balance of rhythmic coordination . FREQUENTLY coaches themselves are responsible for the creation of that imbalance , and many an excellent back has been ruined through coaching tactics alone . Suppose . as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under conditions in which he really should have caught the ball . The coach is so likely to berate him , maybe chase him from the field for the day . In most cases the psychological reaction is disastrous , for the next time that back is called upon to catch punts he is so self-conscious , so over-eager , that he will fumble the ball in most cases . I would handle that back in a different way . He needs no scolding . His mind and heart , both , were in the catching of the ball . He needed more training in mass rhythm , so that , without conscious effort of mind , his muscles would re spond unerringly and mechanically to the situation that his brain had encompassed . To give another example of mass efficiency due to rhythm , I might point to the military drill . The best-drilled company is the one whose drillmaster has an exact sense of rhythm , and who can give his commands in accordance with that sense . The best track men are those whose sense of rhythm tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing gun will speak . Some of them have the sense of rhythm so coordinated with physical rhythm that they can " jump the gum " by a split second , and so obtain a great advantage in the sprints . IT IS impossible for me to go deeper into this matter of rhythm , but you all re member the Four Horsemen who won fame for themselves on the Notre Dame eleven of 1924 . It was their application of rhythm and speed , consciously or not , that made then so formidable despite their light weight . I train my men to measure their opponents ' strength at the beginning of play . They swing into this guard or that guard ; play this tackle or that tackle ; plunge center , or run ends . And when they have found the most vulnerable spot , they hammer , hammer , hammer with timed power at that man , break ing his physical strength , dis turbing his mental poise , and , sometimes , routing his courage . There is one more problem that confronts a coach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity , and that must be jealously and zealously guarded . The player who is kept going up to his maxi mum physical ability soon be gins to break under the physical strain , but the player who is kept going close to the limit of his physical capacity keeps perfectly fit . There must be a balance , When players are driven be yond their individual physical capacities , team play goes to smash .  |
