Achilla Ambrogio Damiano Ratti , Pope Pius XI , is surely one of the world 's most busy men . Last week especially did he toil in the hushed and shadowy gardens of the Vatican in Rome . A large part of his labor was , to be sure , of a somewhat contemplative variety ; the eyes of his attention , diverted always to the odd corners of the world , rested upon the U. S. , where the affairs of the Roman Church flourished exceedingly . <P> The Pope promoted one of his most able U. S. lieutenants . This was the Right Rev. Thomas Joseph Walsh , formerly bishop of Trenton , N. J. , whom Pope Pius elevated to the Bishopric of Newark . At the same time the Pope appointed the Rev. John J. McMahon of Buffalo to fill the vacated seat of Trenton . <P> More tidings arrived in Rome from Scranton , Pa. , to inform His Holiness that the Right Rev. Thomas C. O'Reilly , former pastor of the Church of St. John the Evangelist at Cleveland , Ohio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perusing these , the Pope was able to imagine the city-wide scenes of jubilation which had marked the splendid event . He perhaps pictured to himself the flag-filled town , the excited citizens , the procession of 400 clergymen , the important witnesses , the strange and architecturally miscellaneous cathedral to which humble U. S. worshippers came , and at which non-Catholic passers-by gazed with wonder and dismay . <P> The attention of His Holiness was not , however , directed entirely toward the actions of his U. S. servants . He spoke to 1,000 new members of the Catholic Youth Associations on the subject of athletic and other amusements , saying in heartfelt manner : " Amusements serve to refresh the spirit which otherwise would be too strained and unable to perform with satisfactory capacity its high noble functions . " <P> Several circumstances in the city of Rome demanded the Pope 's attention . One was the solemn benediction performed , near the Forum , by an abbot and a troupe of assorted monks , upon a bevy of parked automobiles . Holy water was sprinkled upon the radiators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patroness of motorists . The other circumstances were connected with Vatican Bond Issue , sold in the U. S. , to finance the building of the College for the Propaganda of the Faith , potent Catholic Missionary institution . The Pope had summoned George William Cardinal Mundelein of Chicago to Rome , so that he might see the cornerstone of the college laid ( TIME , Mar. 5 ) ; last week , the Cardinal was expected soon to arrive at the Vatican , but the cornerstone laying would , it seemed , be delayed by the illness of Willem Cardinal van Rossum , present head of the Propaganda Fide . This was unfortunate , because Cardinal Mundelein had contemplated an almost immediate return to the U. S. <P> Perusing the Vienna Roman Catholic Church Gazette , His Holiness noted that St. Paul 's Church in Vienna had been conducting services for three days " in atonement for outrages on morality " committed by Josephine Baker , Negress dancer , who had been performing next door at the Johann Strauss Theatre .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
