txt Food supplies were dropped from an airplane to Janice Amess , and Axel Simonson , who have been snowbound on top of Pike 's peak for a week . The food was carried by H. C. Lippiutt , and his mechanician , A. C. Luz , both of Los Angeles . As the big plane roared over the summit of the peak , Amess and Simonson , hearing it coming , hurried to the roof of Summit house , and tiliouted their appreciation to the fliers . Tile two men went to the top last Sunday with the first cog road train and did not return , thinking that another train would make the trip Monday . A heavy snowstorm a few hours later blocked the cog road and damaged the telephone line so that they have been marooned since . Lipplatt said that his plane was caught in a treacherous air pocket over what Is known as the bottomless pit and fell 1,500 feet before ho could control it .                 @ @ @ @
