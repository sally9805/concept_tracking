MAN with Wine-skin then proceeds on his way and EXIT at Back to R. SOLANIO down-Stage to L. SALARINO down-Stage to R. ANTONIO C. and a little up-Stage from them . ANTONIO In sooth , I know not why I am so sad:It wearies me ; you say it wearies you ; But how I caught it , found it , or came by it , What stuff ' t is made of , whereof it is born , I am to learn ; And such a want-wit sadness makes of me , That I have much ado to know myself . p. 3 SALARINO Your mind is tossing on the ocean ; There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rich burghers of the flood ,  --  Do overpeer the petty traffickers , That curt'sy to them , do them reverence , As they fly by them with their woven wings . SOLANIO Believe me , sir , had I such venture forth , The better part of my affections wouldBe with my hopes abroad ; And every object that might make me fearMisfortune to my ventures , out of doubtWould make me sad . SALARINO My wind , cooling my broth , Would blow me to an ague , when I thoughtWhat harm a wind too great might do at sea.I should not see the sandy hour-glass run , But I should think of shallows and of flats ; And see my wealthy Andrew dock 'd in sand , Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs , To kiss her burial.But tell not me ; I know AntonioIs sad to think upon his merchandise . ANTONIO Believe me , no : I thank my fortune for it , My ventures are not in one bottom trusted , Nor to one place ; Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . ANTONIO Fie , fie ! SALARINO Not in love neither ? Then let 's say you 're sad , Because you are not merry : and ' t were as easyFor you to laugh , and leap , and say you 're merry , ' Cause you 're not sad . ( BASSANIO , GRATIANO and LORENZO are heard laughing , off L. ) SOLANIO ( Looking off L. , and then speaking . ) Here comes Bassanio , your most noble kinsman , Gratiano , and Lorenzo . Fare ye well:We leave you now with better company . ( SOLANIO crosses R. to SALARINO . ) SALARINO I would have stay 'd till I had made you merry , If worthier friends had not prevented me . ANTONIO ( Up R. C. ) Your worth is very dear in my regard.I take it , your own business calls on you , And you embrace th ' occasion to depart . ( ENTER from L. 2 . E. BASSANIO , LORENZO and GRATIANO . ) SALARINO Good morrow , my good lords . ( SALARINO and SOLANIO are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signiors both , when shall we laugh ? say , when ? You grow exceeding strange : must it be so ? SALARINO We 'll make our leisures to attend on yours . ( EXEUNT SALARINO and SOLANIO R. F. E. ) LORENZO My Lord Bassanio , since you 've found Antonio , We two will leave you : but , at dinner-time , I pray you , have in mind where we must meet . BASSANIO I will not fail you . GRATIANO You look not well , Signior Antonio ; You have too much respect upon the world:They lose it that do buy it with much care:Believe me , you are marvelously chang 'd . ANTONIO I hold the world but as the world , Gratiano ; A stage , where every man must play a part , And mine a sad one . GRATIANO Let me play The Fool:With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come ; Why should a man , whose blood is warm within , Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster ? Sleep when he wakes ? and creep into the jaundiceBy being peevish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love thee , and it is my love that speaks ,  --  There are a sort of men , whose visagesDo cream and mantle like a standing pond ; And do a wilful stillness entertain , With purpose to be dress 'd in an opinionOf wisdom , gravity , profound conceit ; As who should say : " I am Sir Oracle , And when I ope my lips , let no dog bark ! " O my Antonio , I do know of these , That therefore only are reputed wiseFor saying nothing.I 'll tell thee more of this another time:But fish not , with this melancholy bait , For this fool-gudgeon , this opinion .  --  Come , good Lorenzo .  --  Fare ye well awhile:I 'll end my exhortation after dinner . ( LORENZO comes down R. C. ANTONIO is L. GRATIANO meets LORENZO , as the latter comes down . BASSANIO stands down-Stage of them R. C. ) p. 6 LORENZO Well , we will leave you then , till dinner-time : I must be one of these same dumb wise men , For Gratiano never lets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years more , Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue . ANTONIO Farewell : I 'll grow a talker for this gear . GRATIANO Thanks , i ' faith ; for silence is only commendableIn a neat 's tongue dried , and a maid not vendible . ( EXEUNT GRATIANO and LORENZO up-Stage to Back at R. ) ANTONIO ( R. of C. , looking after GRATIANO . ) Is that anything now ? BASSANIO Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing , more than any man in all Venice . His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff : you shall seek all day ere you find them ; and when you have them , they are not worth the search . ANTONIO Well ; tell me now , what lady is the sameTo whom you swore a secret pilgrimage , That you to-day promis 'd to tell me of ? p. 7 BASSANIO ' T is not unknown to you , Antonio , How much I have disabled mine estate , By something showing a more swelling portThan my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be abridg'dFrom such a noble rate ; but my chief careIs , to come fairly off from the great debts , Wherein my time , something too prodigal , Hath left me gag 'd . To you , Antonio , I owe the most , in money and in love ; And from your love I have a warrantyT ' unburden all my plots and purposesHow to get clear of all the debts I owe . ANTONIO I pray you , good Bassanio , let me know it ; And if it stand , as you yourself still do , Within the eye of honor , be assur'dMy purse , my person , my extremest means , Lie all unlock 'd to your occasions . BASSANIO In my school-days , when I had lost one shaft , I shot his fellow of the selfsame flightThe selfsame way with more advised watch , To find the other forth ; and by adventuring both , I oft found both : I urge this childhood proof , Because what follows is pure innocence.I owe you much ; and , like a wilful youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pleaseTo shoot another arrow that self wayWhich you did shoot the first , I do not doubt , As I will watch the aim , or to find both , Or bring your latter hazard back again , And thankfully rest debtor for the first . p. 8 ANTONIO You know me well ; and herein spend but timeTo wind about my love with circumstance ; And out of doubt you do me now more wrongIn making question of my uttermost , Than if you had made waste of all I have:Then do but say to me what I should do , That in your knowledge may by me be done , And I am prest unto it : therefore , speak . ( ANTONIO is C. , BASSANIO on his R. ) BASSANIO In Belmont is a lady richly left ; And she is fair , and , fairer than that word , Of wondrous virtues : sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages:Her name is Portia ; nothing undervalu'dTo Cato 's daughter , Brutus ' Portia:Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth ; For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her sunny locksHang on her temples like a golden fleece ; Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos ' strand , And many Jasons come in quest of her.O my Antonio , had I but the meansTo hold a rival place with one of them , I have a mind presages me such thrift , That I should questionless be fortunate ! ANTONIO Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea ; Neither have I money , nor commodityTo raise a present sum : therefore , go forth ; Try what my credit can in Venice do:That shall be rack 'd , even to the uttermost , To furnish thee to Belmont , to fair Portia.Go , presently inquire , and so will I , Where money is ; and I no question make , To have it of my trust , or for my sake . ( They clasp hands , then EXEUNT ANTONIO and BASSANIO severally as LIGHTS fade out and Dark Change to Second Scene. ) p. 9 p. 10 Act 1 , Scene 2 Second Scene , Belmont ; A Room , in the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right and Left , Draperies .

A Large Hanging Light , C. , above Stage . A Settee , R. C. A Small Table near it . A Low Seat L. of Settee . Music for change sounds on PP. through opening speeches of this Scene . Discovered PORTIA , seated upon Settee ; NERISSA on Low Seat L. of her , working upon a piece of Pettipoint . PORTIA By my troth , Nerissa , my little body is a-weary of this great world . NERISSA You would be , sweet madam , if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are : and yet , for aught I see , they are as sick that surfeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is no mean happiness , therefore , to be seated in the mean : superfluity comes sooner by white hairs ; but competency lives longer . p. 11 PORTIA Good sentences , and well pronounced . NERISSA They would be better , if well followed . PORTIA If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do , chapels had been churches and poor men 's cottages princes ' palaces . It is a good divine that follows his own instructions : I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done , than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching . But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband :  --  O me , the word " choose " ! I may neither choose whom I would , nor refuse whom I dislike ; so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father .  --  Is it not hard , Nerissa , that I can not choose one , nor refuse none ? NERISSA Your father was ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have good inspirations : therefore , the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold , silver and lead ,  --  whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you ,  --  will , no doubt , never be chosen by any rightly , but one who you shall rightly love . But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come ? PORTIA I pray thee , over-name them ; and as thou namest them , I will describe them ; and , according to my description , level at my affection . p. 12 NERISSA First , there is the Neapolitan prince . PORTIA Ay , that 's a colt indeed , for he doth nothing but talk of his horse ; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts , that he can shoe him himself . NERISSA Then is there the County Palatine . PORTIA He doth nothing but frown ; as who should say , " An you will not have me , choose : " he hears merry tales , and smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he grows old , being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth . I had rather be married to a Death's-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these :  --  God defend me from these two ! NERISSA How say you by the French lord , Monsieur Le Bon ? PORTIA God made him , and therefore let him pass for a man ! NERISSA How like you the young German , the Duke of Saxony 's nephew ? PORTIA Very vilely in the morning , when he is sober ; and most vilely in the afternoon , when he is drunk : when he is best , he is a little worse than a man ; and when he is worst , he is little better than a beast . An the worst fall that ever fell , I hope I shall make shift to go without him . NERISSA If he should offer to choose , and choose the right casket , you should refuse to perform your father 's will , if you should refuse to accept him . p. 13 PORTIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee , set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket ; for , if the devil be within , and that temptation without , I know he will choose it . I will do any thing , Nerissa , ere I will be married to a sponge . NERISSA You need not fear , lady , the having any of these lords : they have acquainted me with their determinations ; which is , indeed , to return to their home , and to trouble you with no more suit , unless you may be won by some other sort than your father 's imposition , depending on the caskets . PORTIA If I live to be as old as Sibylla , I will die as chaste as Diana , unless I be obtained by the manner of my father 's will . I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable ; for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence ; and I pray God grant them a fair departure . NERISSA Do you not remember , lady , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a soldier , that came hither in company of the Marquis of Montferrat ? PORTIA Yes , yes , it was Bassanio : as I think , so was he called . NERISSA True , madam : he , of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon , was the best deserving a fair lady . PORTIA I remember him well ; and I remember him worthy of thy praise . ( ENTER BALTHAZAR , at Arch C. from L. ) How now ! what news ? p. 14 BALTHAZAR The four strangers seek for you , madam , to take their leave : and there is a forerunner come from a fifth , the Prince of Morocco ; who brings word , the prince his master will be here to-night . PORTIA If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as I can bid the other four farewell , I should be glad of his approach : if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil , I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shut the gate upon one wooer , another knocks at the door . ( EXEUNT ,  --  BALTHAZAR , then PORTIA and NERISSA , C. to L. , as LIGHTS fade out for Dark Change to Third Scene. ) p. 15 Act 1 , Scene 3 Third Scene , Venice ; An Open Place Before a Synagogue .  --  Full Stage . Time , Late Afternoon . The Synagogue at Back . Large door ( with single step before it ) in front thereof . Entrances , Streets formed by the various buildings , R. and L. , down to Tormentors . Light : As of late afternoon , fading into a fiery sunset , and so almost to dark . The congregation has assembled and the evening service is in progress . The sounds of chanting by the congregation and cantor ; also , occasionally , the voice of the Rabbi , are heard . Several belated worshipers come hurrying on , separately , from R. and L. and are admitted through main door of Synagogue , by the Shamus ( Sexton )  --  each hurriedly performing the ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. of Synagogue Door . ENTER , from Synagogue , JESSICA ; she goes to LAUNCELOT ; they whisper , then EXEUNT R. U. E. After a moment , JESSICA returns , alone , and goes back into Synagogue . ENTER BASSANIO and SOLANIO , up-Stage , from L. They come to about center , and pause a moment irresolutely ,  --  BASSANIO being perplexed to know whether or no SHYLOCK is inside the Synagogue . ENTER from L. F. E. TUBAL and CHUS . BASSANIO stops them and questions TUBAL , who shakes his head in negation . TUBAL and CHUS then proceed toward Synagogue door ; TUBAL , looking off to R. U. E. , sees SHYLOCK approaching . He points him out to BASSANIO : then EXEUNT TUBAL and CHUS into Synagogue . BASSANIO and SOLANIO get down R. , and EXIT SOLANIO , at a gesture by BASSANIO , R. F. E. ENTER SHYLOCK R. U. E. ; as he gets to Synagogue door BASSANIO calls him : " Shylock . " BASSANIO goes up to SHYLOCK : they stand in converse near Synagogue door while several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SHYLOCK speaking as they do so . SHYLOCK ( C. , and BASSANIO R. of him . ) Three thousand ducats ,  --  well . p. 16 BASSANIO Ay , sir , for three months . SHYLOCK For three months ,  --  well . BASSANIO For the which , as I told you , Antonio shall be bound . SHYLOCK Antonio shall become bound ,  --  well . ( As he says " bound " there is a flicker of eagerness in SHYLOCK 'S eyes , immediately veiled . ) BASSANIO May you stead me ? will you pleasure me ? shall I know your answer ? SHYLOCK Three thousand ducats for three months , and Antonio bound . BASSANIO Your answer to that . SHYLOCK Antonio is a good man . BASSANIO Have you heard any imputation to the contrary ? SHYLOCK Ho , no , no , no , no ;  --  my meaning , in saying he is " a good man , " is to have you understand me , that he is sufficient . Yet his means are in supposition : he hath an argosy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , moreover , upon the Rialto , he hath a third at Mexico , a fourth for England ,  --  and other ventures he hath squandered abroad . But ships are but boards , sailors but men : there be land-rats and water-rats , land-thieves and water-thieves ,  --  I mean pirates ; and then there is the peril of waters , winds , and rocks . The man is , notwithstanding , sufficient :  --  three thousand ducats :  --  I think I may take his bond . p. 17 BASSANIO Be assured you may . SHYLOCK I will be assured I may ; and , that I may be assured , I will bethink me . May I speak with Antonio ? BASSANIO If it please you to dine with us . SHYLOCK Yes , to smell pork ; to eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into . I will buy with you , sell with you , talk with you , walk with you , and so following ; but I will not eat with you , drink with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Looking off to R. F. E. )  --  Who is he comes here ? BASSANIO ( Looking off in direction of SHYLOCK 's gaze , then EXIT as he speaks , going to meet ANTONIO , R. F. E. ) This is Signior Antonio . SHYLOCK ( Coming a little R. C. , watching off to R. F. E. as he speaks the following . ) How like a fawning publican he looks ! I hate him for he is a Christian ; But more , for that , in low simplicity , He lends out money gratis , and brings downThe rate of usance here with us in Venice.If I can catch him once upon the hip , I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him. He hates our sacred nation ; and he rails , Even there where merchants most do congregate , On me , my bargains , and my well-won thrift , Which he calls interest . Cursd be my tribe , If I forgive him ! ( SHYLOCK going down Left again , as ENTER R. F. E. BASSANIO and ANTONIO. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over Left , nodding slowly and not turning , while he speaks , ruminating . ) I am debating of my present store ; And , by the near guess of my memory , I can not instantly raise up the grossOf full three thousand ducats . What of that ? Tubal , a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe , Will furnish me . But soft ! how many monthsDo you desire ?  --  ( SHYLOCK , as he speaks , turns so as to see ANTONIO . ) Rest you fair , good signior ; Your worship was the last man in our mouths . ANTONIO ( R. ) Shylock , albeit I neither lend nor borrow , By taking nor by giving of excess , Yet , to supply the ripe wants of my friend , I 'll break a custom .  --  ( Addrssing BASSANIO , who is a little R. of C. ) Is he yet possess'dHow much we would ? SHYLOCK Ay , ay , three thousand ducats . ANTONIO And for three months . SHYLOCK I had forgot ,  --  three months , ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond ; and let me see ,  --  but hear you ; Methought you said you neither lend nor borrowUpon advantage . p. 19 ANTONIO I do never use it . SHYLOCK When Jacob graz 'd his uncle Laban 's sheep ,  --  This Jacob from our holy Abraham was ( As his wise mother wrought in his behalf ) The third possessor ; ay , he was the third ,  --  ANTONIO ( Impatiently . ) And what of him ? did he take interest ? SHYLOCK ( With vigor and great relish . ) No , not take interest ; not , as you would say , Directly interest : mark what Jacob did.When Laban and himself were compromis'dThat all the eanlings which were streak 'd and piedShould fall as Jacob 's hire , The skilful shepherd peel 'd me certain wands , And , in the doing of the deed of kind , He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes , Who , then conceiving , did in eaning timeFall parti-color 'd lambs , and those were Jacob 's . This was a way to thrive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steal it not . ANTONIO This was a venture , sir , that Jacob serv 'd for ; A thing not in his power to bring to pass , But sway 'd and fashion 'd by the hand of heaven.Was this inserted to make interest good ? Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams ? p. 20 SHYLOCK I can not tell ; I make it breed as fast !  --  But note me , signior . ANTONIO ( Aside to BASSANIO . ) Mark you this , Bassanio , The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.An evil soul , producing holy witness , Is like a villain with a smiling cheek ; A goodly apple rotten at the heart:O , what a goodly outside falsehood hath ! SHYLOCK ( C. ) Three thousand ducats ,  --  ' t is a good round sum.Three months from twelve ,  --  then , let me see , the rate  --  ANTONIO Well , Shylock , shall we be beholding to you ? SHYLOCK ( Coming down C. as he speaks , and facing ANTONIO , who is R. of C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a time ,  --  and oftIn the Rialto , This reading originated with the great actor  --  one of Garrick 's rivals  --  John Henderson ( 1747-1785 ) .  --  you have rated meAbout my moneys and my usances:Still have I borne it with a patient shrug ; For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe:You call me " misbeliever ! " " cut-throat ! " " dog ! " And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine , And all for use of that which is mine own.Well , then , it now appears you need my help:Go to , then ; you come to me , and you say , " Shylock , we would have moneys " :  --  you say so ; You , that did void your rheum upon my beard , And foot me as you spurn a stranger curOver your threshold : moneys is your suit ! What should I say to you ? Should I not say , " Hath a dog money ? is it possibleA cur can lend three thousand ducats ? " orShall I bend low , and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Say this :  --  " Fair sir , you spit on me on Wednesday last ; You spurn 'd me such a day ; another timeYou call 'd me dog ; and for these courtesiesI 'll lend you thus much moneys " ? ( SHYLOCK turns away , going a little down L. , as he ends the foregoing speech ,  --  to which ANTONIO has listened with visibly increasing anger. ) p. 21 ANTONIO ( To C. , and furiously . ) I am as like to call thee so again , To spit on thee again , to spurn thee too ! If thou wilt lend this money , lend it notAs to thy friend  --  for when did friendship takeA breed of barren metal of his friend ?  --  But lend it rather to thine enemy ; Who if he break , thou mayst with better faceExact the penalty . SHYLOCK ( L. , and coming C. ) Why , look you , how you storm ! I would be friends with you , and have your love , Forget the shames that you have stain 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doitOf usance for my moneys , And you 'll not hear me : this is kind I offer . BASSANIO This were kindness . SHYLOCK This kindness will I show :  --  ( To ANTONIO ) Go with me to a notary , seal me thereYour single bond ; and , in a merry sport , If you repay me not on such a day , In such a place , such sum or sums as areExpress 'd in the condition , let the forfeitBe nominated for an equal poundOf your fair flesh , to be cut off and takenIn what part of your body pleaseth me. p. 22 ANTONIO Content , in faith : I 'll seal to such a bond , And say there is much kindness in the Jew . BASSANIO You shall not seal to such a bond for me:I 'll rather dwell in my necessity . ANTONIO Why , fear not , man ; I will not forfeit it:Within these two months , that 's a month beforeThis bond expires , I do expect returnOf thrice three times the value of this bond . SHYLOCK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hard dealing teaches them suspectThe thoughts of others !  --  ( SHYLOCK coming a little toward BASSANIO and ANTONIO . ) Pray you , tell me this ; If he should break his day , what should I gainBy the exaction of the forfeiture ? A pound of man 's flesh taken from a manIs not so estimable , profitable neither , As flesh of muttons , beefs , or goats . I say , To buy his favor , I extend this friendship:If he will take it , so ; if not , adieu ; And , for my love , I pray you wrong me not . ( SHYLOCK about to go toward Synagogue , at Back , as though to leave them. ) p. 23 ANTONIO Yes , Shylock , I will seal unto this bond . SHYLOCK Then meet me forthwith at the notary 's ,  --  Give him direction for this merry bond ; And I will go and purse the ducats straight ; See to my house , left in the fearful guardOf an unthrifty knave ; and presentlyI will be with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee , gentle Jew . ( To BASSANIO . ) This Hebrew will turn Christian : he grows kind . BASSANIO I like not fair terms and a villain 's mind . ANTONIO Come on : in this there can be no dismay ; My ships come home a month before the day ! ( EXEUNT ANTONIO and BASSANIO to R. F. E. ) ( SHYLOCK is moving up C. , towards L. , as they EXEUNT . As they are going off , he turns slowly , his gaze following them . ) ( Music . ) ( The Scene is darkening into shadows : the Light falling upon SHYLOCK is a dull , ruddy glow . Sound of Hebrew choir singing within Synagogue .

" To be ruled by my conscience , I should stay with the Jew my master , who  --  God bless the mark !  --  is a kind of devil ; and , to run away from the Jew , I should be ruled by the fiend , who , saving your reverence , is the devil himself .

( Slight pause . ) We all expect a gentle answer , Jew . SHYLOCK ( C. ) I have possess 'd your grace of what I purpose ; And by our holy Sabbath have I swornTo have the due and forfeit of my bond:If you deny it , let the danger lightUpon your charter and your city 's freedom.You 'll ask me , why I rather choose to haveA weight of carrion-flesh than to receiveThree thousand ducats : I 'll not answer that ; But say " It is my humor : " is it answer 'd ?

Are you answer 'd ? p. 77 BASSANIO ( Speaking somewhat wildly , in excitement . ) This is no answer , thou unfeeling man , T ' excuse the current of thy cruelty . ( SHYLOCK , listening ; to answer , turns slightly toward BASSANIO ; there is a flickering gleam of resentment for a moment in his eyes : he has not forgotten that ' t was BASSANIO objected , at first , to ANTONIO signing the bond which has brought him to the present danger ; then SHYLOCK 's countenance again becomes stone hard , and he withdraws his glance , looking before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) SHYLOCK I am not bound to please thee with my answer .

BASSANIO Every offense is not a hate at first . SHYLOCK ( Turning toward him , dangerous and bitter ; speaks abruptly . ) What , wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice ? p. 78 ANTONIO ( To BASSANIO  --  with feeling , yet restraint . ) I pray you , think ,  --  you question with the Jew:You might as well go stand upon the beach , And bid the main flood bate his usual height ; You may as well use question with the wolf , Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb ; You may as well forbid the mountain pinesTo wag their high tops , and to make no noise , When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven ; You may as well do anything most hard , As seek to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  His Jewish heart :  --  therefore , I do beseech you , Make no more offers , ( To DUKE. ) use no further means , But , with all brief and plain conveniency , Let me have judgment , and the Jew his will .

SHYLOCK ( Turning toward BASSANIO , advances slowly to him , gazing into his eyes ; pointing downward , with a stab-like gesture , at the money-bags , but without withdrawing his eyes from BASSANIO 's , speaks : as he utters the words " not draw them " he kicks one of the money-bags aside . ) If every ducat in six thousand ducatsWere in six parts , and every part a ducat , I would not draw them ,  --  I would have my bond . p. 79 DUKE OF VENICE How shalt thou hope for mercy , rendering none ? SHYLOCK ( Facing about , returns toward C. , speaks with restraint but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) What judgment shall I dread , doing no wrong ? You have among you many a purchas 'd slave , Which , like your asses and your dogs and mules , You use in abject and in slavish parts , Because you bought them :  --  shall I say to you , " Let them be free , marry them to your heirs ? " " Why sweat they under burdens ? let their bedsBe made as soft as yours , and let their palatesBe season 'd with such viands ?

PORTIA ( After an instant , and as though nonplused . ) Then must the Jew be merciful . SHYLOCK ( Turning slowly toward her , as he speaks . ) On what compulsion must I ? tell me that ? PORTIA ( Impulsively , yet speaking very simply . ) The quality of mercy is not strain 'd ,  --  It droppeth as the gentle rain from heavenUpon the place beneath ; it is twice bless 'd ,  --  It blesseth him that gives , and him that takes : ' T is mightiest in the mightiest : it becomesThe throned monarch better than his crown ; His scepter shows the force of temporal power , The attribute to awe and majesty , Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is enthroned in the hearts of kings , It is an attribute to God himself ; And earthly power doth then show likest God'sWhen mercy seasons justice .

JESSICA carries in her arms many red and yellow Roses : JESTER , perceiving them , scrambles to his feet and gets silently to L. of Sun Dial , where , concealed by it , he crouches , watching them . The lovers advance ; LORENZO stops JESSICA , laying a hand upon one of her arms ; she turns to him ; they are standing R. C. ; they embrace , then kiss . JESTER , grimacing and laughing , darts forward from his concealment L. of Sun Dial ; dances around them ; then , still laughing , rushes off , L. F. E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JESTER off , turns ; looks toward Back , then , as he speaks , upward toward Sky . ) The moon shines bright :  --  in such a night as this , When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees , And they did make no noise ,  --  in such a nightTroilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls , And sigh 'd his soul toward the Grecian tents , Where Cressid lay that night . JESSICA In such a nightDid Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew , And saw the lion 's shadow ere himself , And ran dismay 'd away . ( They are moving toward R. ) LORENZO In such a nightDid Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew , And with an unthrift love did run from VeniceAs far as Belmont . JESSICA And in such a nightDid young Lorenzo swear he lov 'd her well , Stealing her soul with many vows of faith , And ne'er a true one . LORENZO And in such a nightDid pretty Jessica , like a little shrew , Slander her love , and he forgave it her . p. 103 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; But , hark , I hear the footing of a man . ( Music ceases . ) ( ENTER , up Stairs C. , at Back , STEPHANO . As he comes on , RE-ENTER L. F. E. , as from the HOUSE , THE JESTER , who stands listening . ) LORENZO Who comes so fast in silence of the night ? STEPHANO A friend . LORENZO A friend ! what friend ? your name , I pray you , friend . STEPHANO Stephno is my name ; and I bring wordMy mistress will before the break of dayBe here at Belmont . ( JESTER , hearing this , manifests exuberant joy at the imminent arrival of his mistress , dashes up-Stage and EXIT , down Stairway at Back C.STEPHANO bows as he utters the words " Here at Belmont " and moves toward L. U. E. , where he pauses . ) LORENZO ( To JESSICA . ) Sweet soul , let 's in , and there expect their coming.And yet no matter :  --  why should we go in ?  --  My friend Stephno , signify , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at hand ; And bring your music forth into the air . ( EXIT STEPHANO toward HOUSE L. F. E. LORENZO and JESSICA get down L. of Sun Dial , as STEPHANO goes off . LORENZO , as they move , glances upward ; then down again , at the Dial , which is bathed in silvery moonlight . ) How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank ! Here will we sit , and let the sounds of musicCreep in our ears : soft stillness and the nightBecome the touches of sweet harmony.Sit , Jessica . ( LORENZO , as he speaks , takes off his cloak and spreads it for them to sit upon , against the base of Dial , and they both sit  --  he passing an arm around her so that she is reclining upon his breast , both gazing forward and up . ) Look , how the floor of heavenIs thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:There 's not the smallest orb which thou behold'stBut in his motion like an angel sings , Still quiring to the young ey 'd cherubims ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy vesture of decayDoth grossly close it in , we can not hear it . ( Clapping hands . ) Come , ho , and wake Diana with a hymn ! With sweetest touches pierce your mistress ' ear , And draw her home with music . ( Music sounds , off L. U. E. ) p. 104 JESSICA ( Nestling close to LORENZO . ) I 'm never merry when I hear sweet music . LORENZO The reason is , your spirits are attentive.The man that hath no music in himself , Nor is not mov 'd with concord of sweet sounds , Is fit for treasons , stratagems , and spoils ; The motions of his spirit are dull as night , And his affections dark as Erebus:Let no such man be trusted .  --  Mark the music . ( A cloud-like obscuration of the moonlight now occurs . Song  --  Mixed Voices  --  heard from off L. U. E. ) Come away , come away , death , And in sad cypress let me be laid ; Fly away , fly away , breath ; I am slain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all with yew , O , prepare it ! My part of death , no one so trueDid share it . ( The Song ceases and instrumental Music sounds on . Then ENTER at Back C. , coming up Stairway , PORTIA and NERISSA , followed by JESTER . Arrived at head of Stairway , they pause ,  --  the JESTER crouched at PORTIA 'S feet , gazing up at her with dog-like devotion . ) PORTIA That light we see is burning in my hall.How far that little candle throws his beams ! So shines a good deed in a naughty world . ( LORENZO and JESSICA , couched upon base of Sun Dial , are wrapped in reverie , almost as though asleep . JESTER touches a hand of PORTIA and points out to her the lovers . PORTIA , swiftly and silently , goes down-Stage , snatching up some roses which JESSICA has dropped when she came on at opening of Scene , and , hiding behind Dial , leans over it , mischievously , and drops rose petals upon the dreaming lovers  --  at the same moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S song : ) Between the acres of the ryeWith a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonino , These pretty country folks would lie  --  ( She breaks off her singing and laughs merrily . LORENZO and JESSICA , as rousing from dream-like reverie , rise . Music off L. U. E. becomes softer. ) p. 105 LORENZO That is the voice , Or I am much deceiv 'd , of Portia . PORTIA He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo , By the bad voice . LORENZO Dear lady , welcome home . PORTIA We have been praying for our husbands ' welfare , Which speed , we hope , the better for our words.Are they return 'd ? LORENZO Madam , they are not yet ; But there is come a messenger before , To signify their coming . PORTIA ( Quickly . ) Go in , Nerissa ; Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent ;  --  ( EXEUNT NERISSA and JESTER , who gambols besides her , L. F. E. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Jessica , nor you . ( TRUMPET sounds off R. U. E. ) LORENZO Your husband is at hand ; I hear his trumpet:We are no tell-tales , madam ; fear you not . ( RE-ENTER NERISSA L. F. E.  --  Moonlight becomes very bright again. ) p. 106 PORTIA This night methinks is but the daylight sick ; It looks a little paler ; ' t is a day , Such as the day is when the sun is hid . ( ENTER , coming up Stairway at Back C. , BASSANIO , GRATIANO and ANTONIO . ) PORTIA ( To BASSANIO . ) You are welcome home , my lord . BASSANIO ( Embracing her . ) I thank you , madam . Give welcome to my friend:This is the man , this is Antonio , To whom I am so infinitely bound . PORTIA You should in all sense be much bound to him , For , as I hear , he was much bound for you . ANTONIO No more than I am well acquitted of . PORTIA Sir , you are very welcome to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I scant this breathing courtesy . ( GRATIANO and NERISSA have been disputing , in dumb show , during the two foregoing speeches . ) GRATIANO By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong ; In faith , I gave it to the judge 's clerk ! p. 107 PORTIA A quarrel , ho , already ! what 's the matter ? GRATIANO About a hoop of gold , a paltry ringThat she did give me ; whose posy wasFor all the world like cutler 's poetryUpon a knife , " Love me , and leave me not . " NERISSA What talk you of the posy or the value ? You swore to me , when I did give it you , That you would wear it till your hour of death ;  --  And that it should lie with you in your grave:Though not for me , yet for your vehement oaths , You should have been respective , and have kept it.Gave it a judge 's clerk ! No , God 's my judge , The clerk will ne'er wear hair on 's face that had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a man . NERISSA Ay , if a woman live to be a man . GRATIANO Now , by this hand , I gave it to a youth ,  --  A kind of boy ; a little scrubbd boy , No higher than thyself , the judge 's clerk ; A prating boy , that begg 'd it as a fee:I could not for my heart deny it him . PORTIA You were to blame ,  --  I must be plain with you ,  --  To part so slightly with your wife 's first gift ; A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger , And riveted with faith unto your flesh.I gave my love a ring , and made him swearNever to part with it ; and here he stands ,  --  I dare be sworn for him , he would not leave it , Nor pluck it from his finger , for the wealthThat the world masters . Now , in faith , Gratiano , You give your wife too unkind cause of grief:An ' t were me , I should be mad at it . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , I were best to cut my left hand off , And swear I lost the ring defending it . GRATIANO ( With a spice of malicious enjoyment . ) My Lord Bassanio gave his ring awayUnto the judge that begg 'd it , and indeedDeserv 'd it too ; and then the boy , his clerk , That took some pains in writing , he begg 'd mine : And neither man nor master would take aughtBut the two rings . PORTIA ( With an assumption of incredulous amazement . ) What ring gave you , my lord ? Not that , I hope , which you receiv 'd of me . BASSANIO If I could add a lie unto a fault , I would deny it ; but you see my fingerHath not the ring upon it ,  --  it is gone . PORTIA Even so void is your false heart of truth.By heaven , I will ne'er come in your bedUntil I see the ring . NERISSA ( To GRATIANO . ) Nor I in yoursTill I again see mine . p. 109 BASSANIO Sweet Portia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , If you did know for whom I gave the ring , And would conceive for what I gave the ring , And how unwillingly I left the ring , When naught would be accepted but the ring , You would abate the strength of your displeasure . PORTIA ( Indignantly . ) If you had known the virtue of the ring , Or half her worthiness that gave the ring , Or your own honor to contain the ring , You would not then have parted with the ring.What man is there so much unreasonable , If you had pleas 'd to have defended itWith any terms of zeal , wanted the modestyTo urge the thing held as a ceremony ? Nerissa teaches me what to believe:I 'll die for't but some woman had the ring . BASSANIO No , by mine honor , madam , by my soul , No woman had it , but a civil doctor , Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me , And begg 'd the ring ; the which I did deny him , Even he that had held up the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet lady ? I was enforc 'd to give it to him:Pardon me , good lady ; For by these blessd candles of the night , Had you been there , I think , you would have begg'dThe ring of me to give the worthy doctor . p. 110 PORTIA Let not that doctor e'er come near my house ; Since he hath got the jewel that I lov 'd , And that which you did swear to keep for me , I will become as liberal as you ; I 'll not deny him anything I have ! NERISSA ( To GRATIANO . ) Nor I his clerk ; therefore be well advis'dHow you do leave me to mine own protection . ANTONIO I am th ' unhappy subject of these quarrels . PORTIA Sir , grieve not you : you 're welcome notwithstanding . BASSANIO Portia , forgive me this enforcd wrong ; And , in the hearing of these many friends , I swear to thee , even by thine own fair eyes , Wherein I see myself ,  --  PORTIA Mark you but that ! In both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more will break an oath with thee . ANTONIO I once did lend my body for his wealth ; Which , but for him that had your husband 's ring , Had quite miscarried : I dare be bound again , My soul upon the forfeit , that your lordWill never more break faith advisedly. p. 111 PORTIA Then you shall be his surety . Give him this ; ( Giving ring from her finger to ANTONIO . ) And bid him keep it better than the other . ANTONIO ( Giving ring to BASSANIO . ) Here , Lord Bassanio ; swear to keep this ring . BASSANIO By heaven , it is the same I gave the doctor ! PORTIA I had it of him : pardon me , Bassanio . NERISSA And pardon me , my gentle Gratiano ; For that same scrubbed boy , the doctor 's clerk , Did give me this . ( Giving ring from her finger to GRATIANO . ) PORTIA You are all amazed:Here is a letter , ( Giving one to BASSANIO. ) read it at your leisure ; It comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the doctor , Nerissa there her clerk.Antonio , you are welcome ; And I have better news in store for youThan you expect : unseal this letter soon ; ( Giving ANTONIO a letter , which he takes and opens . ) There you shall find three of your argosiesAre richly come to harbor suddenly . p. 112 BASSANIO Were you the doctor , and I knew you not ? GRATIANO Were you the clerk and yet I knew you not ? ANTONIO Sweet lady , you have given me life and living ; For here I read for certain that my shipsAre safely come to road . PORTIA How now , Lorenzo ! My clerk hath some good comforts too for you . NERISSA Ay , and I 'll give them him without a fee .  --  ( Giving to LORENZO a legal document . ) There do I give to you and Jessica , From the rich Jew , a special deed of gift , After his death , of all he dies possess 'd of . PORTIA It is almost morning.And yet I 'm sure you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ; And charge us there upon inter'gatories , And we will answer all things faithfully . ( As she speaks the foregoing , PORTIA extends one hand to BASSANIO , and the other to ANTONIO and draws them toward L. F. E. , GRATIANO and NERISSA , LORENZO and JESSICA following . As they EXEUNT , the JESTER ENTERS L. U. E. , and , getting down to Sun Dial , drops upon its base and , half-satirically , half-wistfully , accompanying himself upon Lute , begins to sing. ) p. 113 JESTER It was a lover and his lass , AS CURTAINS CLOSE .
