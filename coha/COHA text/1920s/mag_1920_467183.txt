THIS is an account of how Pittsburgh , the toiling Vulcan of American cities , working long and intensely in iron and steel , absorbed in industry , struggling fiercely and avidly in commerce , more concerned with things than men and more interested in bodies than souls , has of a sudden become profoundly interested in the moral welfare of its thousands of neglected boys , mostly the children of the swarming and outnumbering foreign quarters ? the children who will be the human Pittsburgh of the morrow . It is an account of what one city is doing to-day and what all cities may be doing to-morrow . Preaching that the chief trouble with Pittsburgh humanity is human beings , Tensard De Wolf has deeply stirred the life of the city by seeking to improve its human nature ? not by eugenics , but by cutting off in a novel way the source of supply of a large part of the vagrants , tramps , inefficients , and criminals that infest the human family . Most bad men , he says , were bad boys ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than heredity . So De Wolf , after many years of dealing with bad men in municipal politics as secretary of the Voters ' League , in Which capacity he was instrumental in sending a dozen or so to prison , is now concentrating his attention on preventive measures based on the idea of " catching them young . " He does it through the instrumentality of what is called a " Morals Court , " though some other name would be more appropriate , of which he is the " judge , " though he is not a lawyer . It is a formal magistracy informally administered , with greater moral than legal powers , which seeks to cure the various social evils rather than to punish the offenders ? though it is based on authority and does not err in the direction of maudlin sympathy . The main idea is to give erring boys a fair chance by correcting the environments that have overpowered them . The average bad boy is from a weak , inefficient , bad , or demoralized family . He does n't get from family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks to give him a substitute , with the state , instead of the father , wielding the strap of chastisement and uttering the voice of counsel and direction . The court consists in its outward aspect of a few rooms and a few chairs and settees , De Wolf , the boy or boys in the case , complainants , friends , relatives , etc . The method of procedure is that of the family or the neighborhood group . The offense or problem , or whatever it may be , is talked over in free and easy style . The " judge " would scarcely recognize a law-book on sight , and there is no taint of the common or code law in his scheme . He is recognized as a sort of " great father " to all the little savages of Pittsburgh , and so when any of them have been on the war-path against the social order a general powwow of all interested is held in his presence . Sometimes they all talk at once , and more irrelevant than relevant material is adduced . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question or a word of wisdom . Out of this meeting comes a rather generally accepted conclusion that the facts are thus and so and that the course the judge advises is " about right . " Of a typical morning , Judge De Wolf , tall , thin , angular , and smiling quizzically , strolls into the room of the family court , greets familiarly the worried parents , apprehensive , complaining witnesses , policemen , and court attaches . A big boy is accused of misusing some little fellows . " Now let 's see what this is all about , " says the judge , as he takes two of the little fellows in his arms , and asks them to tell him their story . Another boy , who was himself once an object of concern to the court , is present as mentor and interpreter for the little witnesses who are foreign-born . The " trial " consists of an informal talk which soon becomes a babel . Women jabber in several languages , gesticulate in all , and close in on the judge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore order in the gentle manner demanded by this court . Out of it all , " incompetent , irrelevant , and immaterial , " as it would seem to a lawyer , the apparent fact emerges that the accused boy is abnormal . Then the judge descends from his refuge and explains the situation to the kerchiefed mothers who follow his every word with the most grave and concentrated attention . They glimpse that this is something new in courts ? something that seeks neither justice nor vengeance , but rather a cure . Next comes one of the rather frequent Wild West cases . A solemn-faced father and a sad-eyed mother stand in a group with a shamefaced boy . The boy had stolen S17.60 , bought a gun and some other traps , and started for St. Louis where , he gathered , buffalo were numerous and Indians plentiful , and no closed season . With downcast eyes and almost inaudible voice , he confesses the theft , the Wild West inspiration , and his designs on the St. Louis buffalo and red men . " I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? " asks the judge . " Yes , judge , I 'm off it for life , " says the would-be adventurer . " What ' " exclaims the judge . " Through with the Wild West ? Do n't want to be a cowboy any more ; do n't want to ride the plains , shoot , hunt , foil robbers , rescue beautiful girls , explore mountains , and have all sorts of adventures ? Why , I would n't give a snap of my fingers for a boy that did n't Tong for the wild life . " The boy was confused by this sudden turn of the situation , which restored credit to his motive . He confeKed that the Wild West lure was not dead . " Your hunch was all right , kid , " says the judge , " but you took a fool way of getting there . I 'm a Wild West man myself , but not your way . I 'll show you how to get what you want without raising hell and getting into jail . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the parents over the manner in which , through the good offices of the court , the Y. M. C. A. , and a committee of big brothers , the youthful lover of adventure is to be shown how to reconcile it with life as it must be . Next comes a boy accused of having stolen a bicycle from his employer , a merchant . The ease is clear . The boy admits his guilt , as do most boys in this court of no trial but of straightforward investigation . He has some sort of excuse to offer , but the employer is impatient of this informal court. , and demands signal punishment . There is need , he says , for an example . " This looks pretty bad for you , " says the judge , putting his hand on the frightened boy 's shoulder , " but , anyway , you did n't lie about it Pretty sorry now , are n't you ? Think you 'll ever do it again if we get you another chance ? " " No , " says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says the judge , turning to the employer . " Well , this stealing must be stopped . He stole the bicycle ; he admits it and ought to be punished . " " Let 's see about that , " answers the judge . " If you insist have to turn the boy over to the juvenile court , where , on the undisputed facts , he will be sent to the workhouse and branded for life . I do n't think he is really bad . The fact is that I do n't believe there is a living man who did n't steal something or other when he was a kid , when his life was in a miniature stone age . How about yourself ? Will you swear that you never stole anything ? As a matter of fact , can not you recall at this very moment some little theft of your childhood ? Tell me that . No , do n't tell me . Just tell yourself . " The accuser was silent . The judge waited for a full minute . " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we punish this boy in the old way , or shall we deal with him in a way that will make this his last offense ? " Then the judge explained how he proposed to make the boy pay for the stolen bicycle , and at the same time start him on a new road . In the end the employer decided to take the boy hack , and the machinery was started , with the consent of his parents , for putting the boy through the court 's program of bigbrother guardianship , new associations , and better surroundings . Three Italian boys , saucy , hold , and pugnacious , are herded up to the desk by a much ruffled policeman . The boys have long been the pest of his beat , Three anxious , dark - eyed mothers , wrapped in shawls , hover in the background . It appears that the boys are little " terrors " ; that they have a record of petty theft , of worrying the police ; that they have completely defied parental authority and are social rebels and proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against them . The judge considers them gravely , holds a whispered consultation with the parents , and advises that the boys be left with him for a few days . The former go sadly out and an officer takes the unrepentant boys to a rear DOOM . Half an hour later , having cleaned up his calendar , the judge saunters back and sprawlingly sits down on a settee with the three little rogues . He tries to get into their confidence , but they remain obdurate . They think the judge is " soft , " and they are inwardly congratulating themselves on being in his court instead of a regular criminal court . " What you fellows need is a darn good licking , " says the judge , " and I have a mind to give it to you myself . You ought to have your blocks knocked off , and be whipped till you beg for mercy . I guess we 'll put you in the cooler and give you a chance to think it over . " An officer is called and the boys are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule , the boys who come before the Morals Court see no more of the grim side of authority than a detention-room , but in this case a cell was considered advisable . The judge thought that the cell experience would soon sober the boys , but even by the next morning they had not offered their submission , so he ordered them brought to him . " Now , fellows , " said the judge to the boys , " we 're going to quit fooling and get down to brass tacks . You have lied to your father and mother and you have lied to me , and I 'm not going to stand for it . A liar is the lowest thing in the world , and the meanest . I 've known some decent burglars , and I have even met up with murderers that I could be friends with , but nobody can get anywhere with a liar . I 'll do business with anybody but a liar . You boys are just nasty liars , and you are going to stay here till you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ready to come clean ? " The boys looked at one another and remained sulkily silent . " All right , " said the judge , as he stepped out of the room for a minute . He came back with an officer , who took the boys away , one by one . New tactics had been adopted ; the boys were placed in separate cells , far removed from one another in a remote part of the gloomy , clanking cage . Their strength of contumacy had been in union . Facing , iso-rm. lated , the lonely terrors of the night , their courage faded . Within two hours they were imploring the keepers to take them to the judge . He came promptly to his rooms , to find three thoroughly melted little ruffians . They " owned up , " confessed to even more than they had been accused of , promised to repeat their confession to their parents and apologize to them for their many offenses against the family . They lived up to their word , the new road was opened to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has nothing to report but satisfactory progress without a sign of slipping . The little touch of imprisonment , informal and unrecorded , known only to the boys themselves , was like parental correction . It disciplined , but did not degrade . That 's one of the Morals Court principles . A strapping young fellow , already half a rebel against society , bully of a gang that had taken to lording it over one of Pittsburgh 's numerous bridges , was haled before the judge . Women had been insulted on the bridge , peaceable citizens had been assaulted , and many a minor crime had been plotted there and carried out elsewhere . " Listen , Bill , " said the judge ; " we ca n't have this bridge made unsafe for people this way . The gang 's got to let up . It 's got to clean up or we 'll get it . The question is whether it 's going to clean up with my help or be beaten up by the police and sent . to the pen . You are the boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , some of the fellows are afraid of me . " " All right . I know damn well that that gang will do just what you tell it to do . I 'm going to hold you responsible for that bridge . Clean it up and keep it clean or the whole crowd will be put away . " The judge explained what he had in mind for activities for the gang along normal lines . The bridge was " cleaned up " and the gang has become a club . So ; day after day , the boys of Pittsburgh who are in the early stages of rascality or crime file through Judge De Wolf 's court , have their " whys " searched out , their offenses relieved by confession , and are then sent on to the processes that have been worked out for their permanent redemption . " The amazing thing about it , " said Judge De Wolf , after I had followed him through the varied cases of a day ? a day of boys soiled by vice and warped by crime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a court " run by a reg'lar feller dat uses you right , " as one of them commented ? " is that so few of them come back by the back door , as we describe an enforced appearance . Of the five thousand boys and young men we dealt with the first year , only an insignificant proportion failed to make good , and virtually all of the failures slipped because they were congenitally deficient or because their home surroundings neutralized all that we were able to do for them . " In this court the badness of the boy is taken chiefly as a symptom , not usually as the real evil . " Why ? " ? a double-barreled " why " ? is poised at every boy 's case ; the one looking to the ultimate causes of the offending tnd the other to giving the boy the reason of laws and their observance . The actual offense may be awarded some punishment by way of reminding the offender that society is powerful and may be stern ; but the remodeling of the boy proceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his biography and thus to a comprehension of the motivation of his way of life that leads to a countercomprehension by him of the desirability of renovation . This plan is only for boys who can be persuaded to will wholeheartedly to a new life . For the others await the criminal courts , trainingschools , reformatories , prisons , and all institutions or corrective processes that demand physical restraint . It is the weir that saves from that channel the boys who are capable of willing their own betterment , following understanding . The court has no official machinery of its own to carry out its regenerative work , and it has none for the very good reason that Judge De Wolf considered that in his attempt to link up the authority of the city with the voluntary work of the thousands of men he would need to help him in reaching thousands of boys , the thing to be avoided was excessive formality and bureaucracy . What he needed was a spirit rather than a body . In the proceedings of the court the bad boy was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him if be elected to continue to defy the law and society . With the realization of authority always in the background , he was to have the opportunities and joys of a new life opened up to him . In looking around for a solution of the problem of the connecting link between the court and the men who must help , the church organizations were naturally thought of . It was their business to help people , observe the moral law , and to show the way to the better life . What better material for them than the boys picked up by the police in the daily welter of life and brought into the clearing-house of the Morals Court ? So it came about that the churches eagerly took up the new idea of preventing crime by preventing the making of boy criminals . The Protestant churches use the Y. M. C. A. as the means of cornmunication.between them and the court . The Catholics and the Jews each formed an organization of Big Brothers , with a paid secretary to look after their boys in the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovers and diagnoses the individual and group boy problems of the city ; they are classified into their religious affiliation groups , and then through the secretaries they are passed on in a friendly , informal manner to the individuals assigned to them . Each church congregation has a list of men who are willing to undertake the work of helping a boy . The right man is duly found for each boy , and , once appointed , he is heldstrictly to account and must report regularly and concisely . It is his business to keep in close touch with the boy , to see that he carries out the program of work , schooling , and daily conduct that has been prescribed for him as the way out to better things and the way from the harsh punishment of the regular courts and the bitter future that comes with crime . He must be more than a mentor ; he must h : a friend , counselor , and , to some degree , an associate . If he fails he is promptly replaced , as the enthusiasm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creates an unlimited supply of men who are ready to do their best . The work is , wisely , thoroughly decentralized , responsibility being placed on the churches and the Y. M. C. A. of the different districts . Priests , ministers , and rectors are reproached if their sections or their particular congregations are over-represented by the boys who pass through the Morals Court . If a particularly had situation develops , a meeting of the parish congregation is called to consider it . In this way the problem of the bad boy has become in Pittsburgh the pressing problem of the churches ; and the problem of the individual bad boy the problem of an individual churchman . One of the objects of the court is to avoid the stigma that goes even with a juvenile-court process . Most of the boy offenders are not lost to a sense of shame , and when , as sometimes happens , they object to the court 's proposed disposition of them on the perfectly correct ground that it has no authority for it , it is usually enough to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will be passed on to the juvenile court , where they will get a suspended sentence , at best , with a probation officer watching them , and the neighborhood notoriety of his visits and consequent disgrace for sister , mother , and the rest of the family . Thinking only of reclaiming individuals in the beginning , the boys ' work of the Morals Court has grown and gone farther . It has developed group , class , and neighborhood boy problems that have to be handled en masse , as when , through the case of a high-school boy accused of stealing apparatus from the chemical laboratory , it came out that the whole school was deep in a gambling mania , accompanied by an orgy of theft to meet " debts of honor . " Excluding the teachers , Avison , the Y. M. C. A. secretary in charge of the Association 's work with the Morals Court , was able in one heart-to-heart talk , answered with agonized confessions , to stop the whole bad business . Cases of boys who committed thefts while delivering milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small boys to climb stairs for them and encouraging the incidental looting . The employers soon put an end to this practice . Instances of thefts in shops and factories revealed a wide-spread practice of appropriating tools and materials that had gone on so long that it had become almost honored and respected . The employers clamored for condign punishment , but the Morals Court way wrought general reformation . The employment of young boys as newspaper sellers late at night or early in the morning was found to be an open highway to thievery . With the assistance of the publishers general corrective action was taken . This led to a general sweeping of boys off the streets at night . Roy bandits caught in the net of the court never " peach " on their uncaught comrades . They simply go out and bring the whole gang into Judge De Wolf 's chambers just as they would be sure to share any other good thing with the fellows . One gang that had turned into a club appeared in court by the tabooed " back way " of police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? nothing less than a bloody assault . The complaining witness told a plain story of assault and stabbing by the gang , and ex hibited a bloody and jagged wound . De Wolf was sure it could not be so simple as all that . investigation showed that the gang had by permission established its club-room in a cellar where , with crudely printed signs forbidding profanity , obscenity , spitting on the floor , etc. , they were one day sitting around a table discussing their business when , through a swiftly raised board in the floor above , they were deluged with the contents of a pail of slops ? they and all their common belongings were engulfed in the filth and slime . Whereupon , with the mad rage of the pack , they rushed up-stairs and fell on their enemy in the room above . Of course the stabbing could not be overlooked , but De Wolf 's faith in the integrity of that gang was not in the least disturbed . Interests and motives that run with the civic good are substituted for the destructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficial tasks , and the gangs , like the bandits of Mexico in the time of Diaz , become the upholders of law and order , having learned that they are only necessary rules for the right playing of the game of life . Many times have these things been attempted before , but the successful variant in the Pittsburgh experiment is the deft mingling of the authority of the law with the benevolence of the individual . Almost as fundamental as the effect on the boys is the reaction on the men who have come into the work . In making better boys they are making themselves better citizens . The Pittsburgh Morals Court set out to rehabilitate the unfortunate boys of the city and finds that it is regenerating the whole city and inaugurating a method of instilling a social consciousness and a social conscience that may spread to other cities and become , perhaps , one of the most potent of agencies of Americanization ? for a good citizen is a good American .               @ @ @ @ @ @
