txt Notwithstanding the fact that grain crops arc ofil- ; dirtily estimated at 8708.000,000 less than a year ago , the purchasing power of the farmers this year should astound the country . In fact , the biggest buying market since 1920 is now appearing . The farmers ' income is actually larger than at any time in the past five years , and a period of continued prosperity is to be seen for several year yet to conic Our total cultivated crop production is estimated at $9,615,000,000 , against $10,062,000,000 a year ago . The deficit of $447,000,000 was principally caused by wheat , cotton and oats . The official estimate goes still further and separates the grain crops from all others . making for these a total value on December 1 of $3,810.713,000. compared with $4,518,716,000 the year before , the principal deficit being in corn and amounting to $314,238,000 . If taken without any analysis , these figures would jus ? tify a highly pessimistic interpretation . About 80% , of the corn crop is fed on the farms , and therefore is raw material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash corn was $1.09 a bushel , and the average pried of hogs was $8.50 per hundred pounds . On the usual basis of 11 bushels of corn to 100 pounds of live pork , the farmers were feeding at a loss . On December 1 , 1925 , cash corn was worth 66 cents and hogs $11.15 per hundred pounds . The same ratio of 11 to 1 would mean- $7.26 worth of corn in a hog selling for $11.15 , or more than a dollar a bushel . Sheep and lambs are somewhat higher than year , and their numbers have increased . Cattle show an improvement , and there are as many as a ago . The corn belt farmers surely are getting good prices for their corn when sold in animal products . This statement will not meet with the approval of the agitators who , like the mine leaders , live on calamity . But the figures answer such objectors . Our corn crop is large enough for all needs , but when sold as grain is relatively cheap . Ever since last July , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crop . this newspaper has been pointing out that our wheat market must be on a domestic basis . That fact is beginning to appear now . Ailvances in the wheat market are likely to have an effect upon corn , and it is not at all improbable that before spring corn will sell even higher than now . Agriculture has traveled a cycle of five years duration , and is now on the upgrade . Unless some unforeseen industrial depression occurs , it is likely to continue upward for some time to come . As the rural population consumes 40 per cent . of our production , the stage is set for a great buying movement to make up for the unfilled ratedeJof the pant five years .
