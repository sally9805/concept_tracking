With pomp unusual to West Virginia , which has very few colleges , John Roscoe Turner , last week , was inaugurated President of the University of West Virginia . He had been Dean of New York University 's Washington Square College in Manhattan . From a huge commercial community , he went to a small industrial one ( Morgantown ) . From merely purveying education ( economics is his specialty ) , he went to set a state 's educational pace . <P> West Virginia expects much from its land grant university . The state covers the twisted knot of Appalachian mountain ridges . Soft coal constitutes its great wealth . Its coal , petroleum and natural gas sales approximate a third of a billion dollars a year . Those minerals West Virginians want to conserve and at the same time get more money for each year 's output . They expect their state university to tell them how . <P> The state produces more hardwood lumber than any other except Arkansas . And it has on its mountains great wealth in yellow poplar , birch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They too must be wisely utilized . <P> In the Morgantown hills around the University is fine glass sand . The state 's glass and glassware industry , with $50,000,000 production yearly , looks to the laboratories for pure research in glassmaking . <P> Not so seeking is the $100,000,000 iron &; steel business . Pittsburgh 's schools are available enough for them . <P> Agriculture is the preoccupation of practically all state universities , but not of West Virginia , although its corn , hay , tobacco , potatoes and fruits are worth $100,000,000 each year . Its hillbilly farmers are too difficult to reach with farming information. * <P> An immediate dependency upon the University is the state legislature 's . The senators and representatives expect the law school professors to draft laws and even to guarantee their authority . <P> These leanings upon the University , President Turner knows . He was born and partially educated in the state . So , astutely he gave his inaugural address last week a utilitarian tone : " This institution is not an end in itself , but a means to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluated in terms of its yield . It deserves and can rightfully claim the . united support of thoughtful citizens on the ground of its educational service . . . . Build the University into the life of the state . " That was a parody of Cornell 's byword , where President Turner once taught : " Build yourself into Cornell . " <P> <P> * West Virginia 's illiteracy percentage is 6.4 . That is better , however , than the percentage of any southern state , except Maryland .
