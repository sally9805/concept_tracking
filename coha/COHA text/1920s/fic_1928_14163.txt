At the rise of the curtain Eva Hibbert-Havens is seated , dressed for dinner , in a beautiful chair from which she does not rise until the close of the play . She is a stout aristocratic lady , assertive but illogical . In short , a Boston grande dame . She calls to her second husband who passes in the hall : EVA Charles ! Come in , please . CHARLES ( Offstage , reluctantly ) I could wait in the den , dear , until they come . EVA ( Firmly ) Well , please sit down just for a minute . ( Charles Havens comes in . He is an absentminded , slightly apologetic man in a tuxedo . ) I have n't told Daughter yet just who the guests are . I told her to dress for dinner quietly and she 'd find out later who they were . CHARLES ( Indifferently ) Surely it would n't hurt her to say that her brother is coming to dinner . EVA ( Severely ) Her brother , and her brother 's wife . CHARLES ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , so to speak . EVA Well , if I had told Daughter that !  --  And I want her to look especially well tonight . ( Forcefully ) To contrast with the rouge and tinsel of her " sister . " p. 3 CHARLES ( In surprised protest ) But George 's wife wo n't wear rouge and tinsel . EVA How do we know what George 's wife wo n't wear ? Where did he find her , I 'd like to know ? In a station lunchroom , very likely . In a prize shooting gallery . CHARLES ( Amusedly ) In a circus , perhaps . EVA ( With indignation ) I mean that my son , George Hibbert Junior , of the Boston Hibberts , married miles beneath him . CHARLES ( Absentmindedly ) Was that her name ? EVA As you say , he may have married a trapeze artiste . CHARLES ( Prosaically ) My dear , you 're always reminding me that you married beneath you when you married me . Why blame George for doing what you have found fairly satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with still some prestige to make . When I married you I had been for eight years the widow of the most distinguished citizen of Boston . I could have married someone much lower than my husband 's assistant manager , and still faced the world . CHARLES ( Gently ) My dear , I was not your husband 's assistant manager . I was his foreman . p. 4 EVA Foreman , never . I used to see you sign his checks for him . I married my husband 's sub-manager ; George has married his landlady 's furnace-shaker . CHARLES ( Shaking his head ) He has dragged the name of Hibbert in the coal bin . ( Enter Daughter in evening dress . A beautiful girl of twenty-five is Julia Hibbert-Havens . She is strong-minded and so has naturally found with such a mother that concealment is the best policy . We know her to be excitingly tricky , so we are able to appreciate that her demureness in the presence of her mother is a trifle exaggerated . ) JULIA Well , Mother , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed ! CHARLES It 's your brother George . JULIA And his bride ? EVA Yes , his acquirement . He holds an indignation meeting against me for two years because I married your present father , and then he marries a Nobody and breaks the silence by inviting himself to dinner . JULIA Who was she ? EVA No one seems to know ; a boardinghouse girl ; someone says , a waitress in a station lunchroom  --  CHARLES  --  You said so yourself . p. 5 EVA Perhaps the proprietress of a shooting gallery  --  CHARLES  --  That was your guess . EVA Do n't interrupt ! And Charles heard that she was from a circus . CHARLES I did n't hear , I guessed . EVA Well , take your choice . Those are the rumors . George has married beneath him . It 's a wonder the church allows it . Every debutante marries her chauffeur ; her brother marries her lady 's maid . It is a national danger . If everybody married beneath them where should we be , I 'd like to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It shows a nationwide admiration for the lower classes that is deplorable . That 's what George said in his terrible letter after I had married a second time . Such names he called me ! It was like Forbes-Robertson talking to his mother in Hamlet . Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson was a British actor whose daughter and son-in-law , Dinah and Vincent Sheehan , were Wilder 's close friends . CHARLES ( Vaguely ) Ahis there a situation like that in Hamlet ? ( He wanders to the bookcase ) EVA ( With alarm ) No , there is notnot the slightest . JULIA What does it matter ? p. 6 EVA ( Anxiously ) Do let us be frank with one another . You do n't realize how difficult this is for me . What are you doing , Charles ? You 're not listening to me . CHARLES Oh , yes I was . I was seeing if I could find Hamlet . EVA Julia , I want you to burn every copy of Hamlet there is in the house . JULIA It 'll spoil the sets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets . JULIA Not in Boston . EVA What was I saying , Charles ? CHARLES You wanted us to be frank with one another . My dear , I 've been frank . I understand perfectly that your son was angry with you when you married me . I wrote him that I did not pretend to be more than a plain ordinary man . JULIA Mother , it 's you that are not being frank . EVA ( Crying ) Have n't I told you that she was a station restaurant waitress ? CHARLES ( Pained ) Dear me ! What an affliction ! JULIA All the better . Then he 's in a glass house ; and wo n't dare to throw stones at you anymore . p. 7 EVA It 's not that I mind . I 'd like to give him a good talking to , myself . It 's because I 'm in a glass house . CHARLES ( Gently ) My dear , seeing that this does n't concern me , may I retire to my den until your son arrives ? ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family . No more mutual recriminations ; everybody wears muzzles  --  in fact , they 've married muzzles . CHARLES I daresay he 's timorous about coming to see you now . EVA ( Sharply ) Not at all ! There 's always you as a precedent . CHARLES ( Cowed ) Dear me ! So there is , so there is . There 's the doorbell now . EVA Now do n't anyone be tactless . JULIA Do n't anyone mention boardinghouses or glass houses , or anything that might cause self-consciousness . CHARLES Am I to stay in the room all the time ? EVA Yes ; they are not to think I have any regrets .  --  I shall soon find out which rumor was correct . ( Enter George and his wife . George is an obstinate young man ; Phyllis is an extraordinarily pretty young girl with large blue eyes . Her hair is arranged to resemble Billie Burke 's ; she is exquisitely dressed and has charming manners . It is the most difficult moment in her life. ) p. 8 GEORGE ( Kissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is my wife . EVA ( Offering her cheek ) You may , my dear . ( After Phyllis has kissed her ) We meet at last , so to speak . PHYLLIS ( Blushing ) Better late than never , as they say . GEORGE ( To Charles , shaking hands stiffly ) How do you do , Mr. Havens . Phyllis , this is my father . PHYLLIS ( Faintly ) I 'm very happy to know you . EVA George , why do n't you introduce your wife to Daughter ? JULIA Oh , we have met , Mother . EVA ( In astonishment ) When was that ? JULIA I have called on them several times . EVA ( With evident displeasure ) So that 's how you spend your time in Atlantic City . And never say a word about it to me ! JULIA I was saving it as a pleasant surprise . EVA You misjudged !  --  Were you ever in Boston before , Phyllis ? p. 9 PHYLLIS Unfortunately not . I have been kept pretty regularly to Atlantic City . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHYLLIS I have occasionally run up to New York for shopping . EVA ( Urgently ) Charles ! My smelling salts  --  in the hall . ( He gets them ) But naturally from your position in the station you were able to see the trains depart for Boston . PHYLLIS ( Agreeably ) Oh , yes . There are trains . EVA ( Nodding her head enigmatically ) Hmm  --  yesyes . Did you find it monotonous ?  --  Standing over the counter , long hours ? PHYLLIS ( At sea ) You mean , did we come by boat ? JULIA No , dear , Mother means : Did you find the trip longer than you expected ? PHYLLIS ( To her ) I like traveling . EVA I see ! Naturally . How fortunate . There must be long waits while the tents are being nailed down .  --  Then there 's the long , hot parade . PHYLLIS ( To George ) I 'm afraid  --  I do not understand p. 10 GEORGE You mean , Mother  --  ? JULIA ( To the rescue ) By parade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear so much about . PHYLLIS ( To Eva , brightly ) Oh , no . It 's a pleasure , I assure you . And on the hottest days there are the awnings  --  that 's what you meant by " tents . " EVA Yes , yes . But no doubt there are tents , too . Fortune tellers , and  --  PHYLLIS  --  A very few .  --  EVA  --  And among them , the shooting gallery . PHYLLIS ( Seeking light ) The shooting gallery ? EVA ( Boldly ) The one you were interested in . ( At last Phyllis is completely perplexed . ) PHYLLIS ( In a pretty confusion ) I 'm afraid I 'm very dull . But I 've heard of the subtlety  --  the wit  --  of Boston conversation . I have always lived quietly with my mother in our little home on the North Shore . I 've had little experience  --  JULIA  --  Do n't apologize , Phyllis . Mother has a playful way you 'll understand when you get to know her better . p. 11 EVA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now Eva ! You know you 're famous for your wit . GEORGE It has developed then in the last year  --  amazingly . EVA ( Retorting ) Think of what I 've had to bear . GEORGE I warned you in good time . ( Fortunately dinner is announced at this point . ) EVA ( Rising and repeating a formula used by all Boston hostesses at informal dinners to relatives ) We live very simply , but of such as it is we try to obtain the best , and to that you are always welcome . ( She leads the way out with Charles ) PHYLLIS ( Turning , at the front of the stage ; plaintively ) I do n't understand your mother at all , George  --  ( She sees Julia and runs to her ) When are you to be married , Julia ? JULIA ( Smiling down at her happily ) On Saturday afternoon at four o ' the clock . PHYLLIS Why at four ? JULIA Because they do n't let the dear boy out of the factory until three ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on into dinner. )
