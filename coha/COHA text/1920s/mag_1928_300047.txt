For several years there was very little doubt about who would win the National Singles Championship at Forest Hills , L. I. Tilden would swing lazily through the first rounds ; in the third and fourth rounds it became easier to see that he would win the last . In late afternoon matches his huge shadow would creep and flicker toward the clubhouse . By the time his opponent 's shadow was in the middle of the press marquee , Tilden 's shadow had gone upstairs . It was a terrifying shadow , with steps like dark lightning , enough to frighten any opponent . <P> This year , Tilden , suspended from amateur play for writing signed articles , attended the matches in a grey suit after he had left the vaudeville theatre where he was doing a turn . Henri Cochet was picked to win and would have been even if Tilden had been playing . Nevertheless , the tournament was a series of upsets . <P> In the first round Dr. George A. King took three straight sets from John Hennessey who has been regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this melancholy season . <P> The next round proceeded without untoward victories and defeats . Cochet , waggling his head from time to time as if he were baffled by the problem of what to have for dinner , put little Junior Coen out of the running . <P> Four of the eight matches in the third round were upsets . Hunter beat " Bounding Basque " Borotra , 0-6 , 5-7 , 6-0 , 6-4 , 6-2 . Australian Jack Crawford eliminated John Van Ryn , Princeton star . Brugnon beat Dr. King who had slumped after his match with Hennessey , Disconcerted , Cochet captured three out of four listless sets from menacing Mercur . <P> In the quarter finals , Frank Shields , the U. S. Junior Champion who lives in Brooklyn and has a serious face , beat famed Jacques Brugnon , the veteran of the French contingent , 7-5 , 6-1 , 6-0 . Abruptly people realized that Shields had not yet , in his six tournament matches , lost a single set . Would he beat Cochet in the semifinals ? Basing their predictions upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might . Shields did n't . In the finals , Hunter met Cochet . <P> Hunter came out first ; Cochet seemed to be nervous as they stood in front of the cup for the camera men . Hunter went through the first set , Cochet took the second , Hunter the third . After the five-minute rest , Cochet came out in a knitted shirt , his eyes looking huge and tired in his little pale face . He spurted five games ; Hunter caught him ; Cochet took the set and then , speeding up his game to somewhere near its peak , the last one . The scores : 4-6 , 6-4 , 3-6 , 7-5 , 6-3.
