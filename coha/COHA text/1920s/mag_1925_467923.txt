IN tourist-ridden southern California they capitalize Spanish vestiges almost unmercifully . You are never allowed to forget Padre Junipero Serra , that famous Franciscan ; he divides the honors with Helen Hunt Jackson 's Ramona . They advertise the old Spanish Missions vociferously ; and these are worth advertising , being historically romantic , physically lovely , and tragic in decay . I say no word against the Missions , for of them one does not tire . It is a great regret to me that . I have seen only a few of them . One tires immediately and profoundly of Ramona , for she seems to have had as many places of sojourn as Washington had headquarters or Lafayette had four-posters ; and it is all rather silly and forced . The Spanish influence , which in San Francisco is a single element naturally felt among many others , becomes in southern California an over-emphasized business asset . The populated region is overwhelmingly American , and Spain withdrew from it long since . There are plenty of Mexican families clustered in the towns and villages ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , seeking health and wealth , has swamped them . Southern California has no continuous history that you can trace visibly ; and Missions and such are mere furbished monuments to catch the tourist 's eye . There is really no practical use for Spanish in Los Angeles or San Diego counties . Kansan or Iowan would be more to the purpose . Farther east , however , lie Arizona , New Mexico , and southern Texas ; and in this real Southwest , Spain has played a different role . Here she is no licensed purveyor of the picturesque , long sinceelbowed out of the foreground except as , costumed on street corners , she can sell her wares to the tourist . Nowhere , except in Virginia and along the Massachusetts coast , can our country boast a continuous civilization of three centuries ' duration ? save in the Southwest . St. Augustine is hardly a case in point , since St. Augustine to-day has nothing whatever in common with St. Augustine as it was founded . There has been nothing Spanish about St. Augustine these hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously continuous a civilization ( such as it is ) as in New Mexico . Changes have been little felt here since the sixteenth century and the conquistadores . The New Mexicans have suffered few , if any , of the irruptions and interruptions so characteristic of our violent national history . They were separated from the vicissitudes and triumphs of our colonial period by two thousand miles of unknown territory , by Spanish blood , and by inherited Spanish rule . In the early nineteenth century they automatically became Mexican citizens instead of Spanish subjects . It must have made very little social and human difference . The bitterness of the free-soil controversies did not touch the New Mexicans , for they were not included in the Louisiana Purchase . Nor did they share in the thrilling , if not wholly creditable , adventure of the Texan Republic . ( The Texan Santa Fe Expedition was only a grim joke . ) Nothing , indeed , of our feverish influence touched them , except for the traders who traveled the Santa Fe Trail in the ' twenties and ' thirties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade came our war with Mexico . Then , and only then , did their civilization begin to be affected by the United States . The astonishing fact , to the sojourner in the New Mexican desert , is that the effect of the United States has been so slight . You are surrounded here by an old Spanish civilization . The Spanish of it is much more emphatic everywhere than the American of it . There is , also , of course , the Indian of it . " In a land of sand and ruin and gold , " I used to quote to myself ; the tone-color of the familiar words seeming to fit the landscape peculiarly , even though the gold is rather a matter of sunlight on the desert than of treasures within the earth . Pueblos , adobe houses , barren beautiful mountains , burros , mesas , dry arroyos , the Indian and Mexican skins ? all blend together into a soft , sad , dusty brown that the imagination connects immemorially with Spain . The emptiness , the sleepiness , the sudden note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as un-American as anything to be found in our great country . There is really very little United States to be savored . The country has never stopped being Spanish in temper , in language , in blood , in habit of life . " Santa F ? ? " said a good American in Albuquerque . " Oh , it 's just a Mexican town . Their principal pastime up there is doing nothing . " I suspect that he was right ; and certainly Santa Fe is far less American than the capital of any other sovereign state that I have ever seen . I do not know how much they " do " in Santa Fe , beyond making corrupt politics more corrupt , but visually speaking , it is more Spanish than American , and more Mexican than Spanish . All speeches made in the New Mexico legislature have to be translated by an interpreter into Spanish , sentence by sentence , as they are uttered . You can not live in this country satisfactorily without speaking Spanish ? and you certainly can not safely commit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to be unacquainted with English . If I speak casually of committing crimes , it is because one gathers that , in New Mexico , almost every citizen finds it , sooner or later , necessary to his business or his happiness to do so . The Anglo-Saxon American has not , according to his little habit , dominated the scene immediately on arrival . Except in a commercial sense , he has not " taken over " the country at all ; and up to a very short time ago the Spaniard owned most of the land , as he still owns the New Mexican soul . Why has the habitually dominant race failed here , when it has triumphed at once in every other part of the West ? That continuous civilization is , no doubt , one of the main reasons . The Southwest was not " new " country ; it was the oldest section , humanly speaking , of United States territory . But southern California also was " old " ; and southern California has been socially and physically conquered with no delay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? reason is probably this : that there was nothing in the Southwest that the dominant race supremely wanted . Gregg ( our chief contemporary authority on the Santa Fe trade ) says that the Indian attacks on the Santa Fe caravans were few and negligible became the white men carried . no ploughs . They threatened no permanent settling ? or stealing ? of the land . They were frankly transitory ; and their trains were like the great teacaravans that used to wander back and forth between central Asia and Archangel on the Arctic . The same Pawnees that were the terror of the Oregon Trail let the Santa Fe traders by . Tragic episodes occurred , of course , now and then , but they were far less molested than the northern pioneers . The Southwestern desert did not lure the farmer or the family man . There were no women and children on the Santa Fe Trail ? unless now and then a Spanish lady returning to Santa Fe or Chihuahua by the land route . Of precious metals there seems always to have been a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nature and conformation of the country made them difficult to get at . You can not do placer-mining where there are no rivers ; you can not , mine comfortably at all where there is no water to drink . The Mexicans worked the miner in desultory fashion , but it was mostly sheep country . There was never any big " strike , " never any gold-rush or occasion for a gold-rush . Nothing , in other words , to lure the adventurer or to tempt the sober citizen . The great deposits of coal that are said to underlie the soil of New Mexico are still undeveloped . The Americans seeped into New Mexico ; they never really invaded it or colonized it . There were ranches in the days of the cattle kings ; but while this is good sheep country , it is not good cattle country ? not , at least , under the modern conditions of cattle-raising . Within a very few years they have tried again to make cattle country of it , and have miserably failed . That sparsely inhabited land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted themselves to its peculiarities and are satisfied . The only thing an ambitious man could acquire was land by the square mile ; and he hardly knew what to do with the land if he got it . There has been plenty of landgrabbing in the Southwest ? organized pillage of the Indians and violent work with the vast holdings of Spanish land owners --  -- but there has never been a real American invasion . The later seepage into northern New Mexico has been caused very largely by two discoveries : first , that it is a marvellously curative climate for tuberculosis ; second , that the Pueblo Indians and their ways and works are what is known as " picturesque . " " Lungers " and artists have taken to New Mexico in numbers . The Middle West , which seems to be obsessed with the idea of packing itself and its property into an automobile and looking for a pleasanter habitation somewhere between the Rockies and the Pacific , has dropped a good many pilgrims in the Southwest , although most of them push on to southern California . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name in northern New Mexico : Santa Fe and Albuquerque . Santa Fe despises Albuquerque for an uninteresting and commercially minded place ; Albuquerque despises Santa Fe because it is divided between politicians and a-sthetes . In Santa Fe they shudder at the nearly unrelieved Americanism of Albuquerque ; in Albuquerque they shudder at the riotous living and the shameless politics of Santa Fe . You take your choice . Concerning Santa Fe , I must state my own case in the very teeth of the Santa Fe cult . A lovelier situation than this it would be unreasonable to ask and hard to find . Santa Fe is uplifted seven thousand feet in air , amid a tumble of mountain ranges ? the Jemez to the west , the Pecos melting into the Sangre de Cristo on the east . It has the charm of the city to which you must climb . Those of us who were taught in youth that it was the oldest town in the United States have dreamed of it , off and on , since childhood . Well , the Plaza is there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe ) ranged along one side ; with a monument , too , marking the end of the Santa Fe Trail . There is on the outskirts the old , old church of San Miguel ; there are mementos of the turbulent Mexican history of the first third of the nineteenth century . Unfortunately , they have developed in New Mexico a thing called the " Santa Fe type of architecture " ? a graceless blend of Spanish and Hopi . The Spanish type exemplified in the old Governor 's Palace has a distinction , a charm , a fitness of its own : you can not do better in this climate and this landscape . The Hopi house is , however , perfectly unadaptable to American life ; and the grotesques that cluster near the Santa Fe Plaza are disillusioning ? would be pathetic were they not so strident . The State buildings arc like many others scattered over our broad land ; merely uncompromisingly American and had . The New Fonda Hotel , the Art Museum , the Post Office , are like nothing on earth except their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed in Santa Fe , one wonders on what insane root the architects had dined . After all , they had the excellent if unpretentious Governor 's Palace hi their line of vision before they went to sleep . The interior of the Art Museum , the lobby of the hotel , are well decorated and very handsome in their way ; but inevitably one steps outside again and beholds the impossible fa ? ades . An Indian pueblo can be very impressive ; but the American conception of modernized and adapted Hopi is like Mrs. Todgers 's idea of a wooden leg ? though I believe , actually , Mr. Pecksniff never acquired that contribution to Art . It is partly the architecture , no doubt , that makes Santa Fe so disillusioning . As a Mexican town , it is not a very good Mexican town ; rather undignified and squalid . As an American town , it is not successful . Climate and situation apart , it would be fur most of us a depressing place of residence . To live in the very spot where New Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . Besides , the devotees of the picturesque have turned Santa Fe ? as one understands they have turned Tahiti ? into a sort of Greenwich Village . The Art Museum is full of bad pictures , the hotel is full of atrocious food , and the Post Office , one feels sure , is full of hectic and mendacious correspondence . Certain resorts in the neighborhood of Santa Fe must be heavenly places to linger in , for every prospect pleases . But the capital itself they have ruined . Even the delightful Governor 's Palace , in becoming a museum , has inevitably become dismal . Of Taos , sixty miles to the north , I can not speak . There is some good painting done at Taos , as we know ; more than that I can not say . I have never been there ? and fancy I shall never go , since one normally reaches Taos via the tragic and tawdry city of the Holy Faith of St. Francis . Some prices are too high to pay for the satisfaction of minor curiosities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's desire had been set on it long since . If divorce has " made " Reno financially , tuberculosis has " made " both Albuquerque and Santa Fe , I take it , in the same sense . Albuquerque is not a particularly attractive place , for , though it has an altitude of four thousand feet , and commands adorable views of the Sandia mountains ( for which I , myself , have an incurable passion ) it is municipally ugly . Moreover , the endless rows of little shacks that consist chiefly of a screened porch with a bed on it , are depressing . The object of the shack is only too clear ; and the inhabitants ? hopeful or hopeless ? take no trouble to beautify their surroundings . The shack seems no more like a home than the automobile you pass , parked for the night in the open desert , forty miles from anything except the Santa Fe Trail . You have to work for vegetation in these desert towns , and the number of Albuquerque householders who feel that a dirt chicken-run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The American part of Albuquerque is entirely hideous . Its only charm lies in the few old Spanish gardens , the frankly Mexican life . The Santa Fe Railroad hotel ? the Alvarado ? is the only beautiful building that Americans have erected there , and many of the Spanish houses are falling to decay . Though Albuquerque is much less advertised than Santa Fe , it is more accessible and , in several ways , more rewarding . Santa Fe is not easy to get to ? this is the third time I have taken the Santa Fe route home from the Coast , and the first time I have ever achieved Santa Fe itself . Not even this time did we attempt to reach it by train ? though there is a train , sometimes , from Lamy on the main line . We motored to it from Albuquerque . I shall always motor to Santa Fe from Albuquerque . Not only is the drive one of the most beautiful and one of the most exciting in the country ( those who have dared La Bajada Hill know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Santa Fe 's proud pretensions , is less depressing than the capital . It is , moreover , an excellent center for wondrous journeys into the ever-marvellous desert , to the feet . of divinely beautiful mountains . Except for a new hotel just finished ( protest , apparently , against the benevolent despotism of the Santa Fe Railroad ) , the citizens of Albuquerque have not indulged into the " Hopi house " vagary . The hotel ? I forget what it is to be named ? is an enormous Hopi house , worse perhaps than anything in Santa Fe . But so far it is alone . True , the University of New Mexico is more or less Hopi ; but it has the grace to sit down at a distance , among its own trees , on the tubercular side of the tracks , and not to mass its Hopi-ness in the public vision . Let it be said here that one was tempted ? while sympathizing with the desire of Albuquerqueans to thumb their noses at the despotic Santa Fe ? to give them Machiavellian advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but with flattery and argument . They can not buck the Fred Harvey system : consider the strategic position of the railroad ? sole carrier for a region five hundred miles in width and fifteen hundred miles in length . Consider also its organization . A system that can run a successful hotel on the brink of the Grand Canyon , to which all water must be carried sixty miles , and can pick up fruit and game in the middle of nowhere , to serve to you fresh that night in the dining ear , has nothing to fear from a rival hotel in a place where it has an excellent one of its own . Albuquerque should have approached the Santa Fe Railroad on its knees , saying " 0 king , live forever . " Then it might have risen to its feet and proceeded with cogent and practical argument . Albuquerque has a right to insist on its position as the only convenient tourist center between the Mojave desert and Colorado . It is on the main line of the railroad ? which Santa Fe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better center for excursions ? being three thousand feet lower , and tapping not only the Santa Fe region but also a vast , picturesque country to the west . It is the junction for the line down to El Paso and old Mexico . Moreover it is a city , with some of a city 's resources ; not , like Santa Fe , a much disfigured museum piece . To go to Taos and all the beautiful crannies of extreme northwestern New Mexico , you can start more easily from Santa Fe ; but Albuquerque is actually within striking distance of more pueblos than is the capital . If from Santa Fe you wish to reach Isleta , Laguna , or Acoma , you must first come sixty miles westward to Albuquerque ; and San Domingo , Cochiti , Abo , Sandia ( I have an unquenchable desire to see Sandia : I am told it is the dirtiest pueblo in the state of New Mexico ) are as well reached from Albuquerque as from Santa Fe . As for all the tourist goals in eastern Arizona , Albuquerque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no La Bajada Hill to negotiate . The Santa Fe Railroad has a charming trick of building good hotels suddenly in the middle of nothing at all ; but it can not make points of departure and repair of places like Flagstaff or Williams or Gallup . They do , however , owe it to the hundreds of thousands who are bent on seeing America last ? if not first ? Lo make a tourist center somewhere in the beautiful and historic Southwest . At present , if you wish to stop en route between the Grand Canyon and Chicago , you are heavily penalized . The California Limited ( which is , in summer at least , their one first-class train ) will make no reservations to points between the Grand Canyon and Kansas City . H you wish to stop at Albuquerque or Santa Fe , you depend on luck alone . There may be space on the Limited when it pulls into the station ; probably there is not . If you must have a Pullman reservation ahead ( most people have a preference that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inferior trains which carry no observation car and no dining car . Fred Harvey will feed you properly when you arrive at one of his eating-houses ; but you may be three hours late for breakfast , and there is nothing that you can do about it . No wonder most tourists pass through New Mexico without getting off the California Limited . As there is no reason on earth , except the Grand Canyon , why anyone should travel to the Coast ria the Santa Fe , it would seem as though the Santa Fe itself were neglecting its opportunities . They have immense and exclusive assets in the Spanish-Indian Southwest , but instead of luring the tourist hillier , they penalize him for stopping . It is rumored that the Santa Fe intends to develop Jemez Hot Springs eventually , when everyone has seen the Grand Canyon . Perhaps , then , Albuquerque will be better served . At present , it is served very ill ; and the new hotel is really a pathetic and not very lucid statement of its dire case . Why should the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Beaten Path in Arizona and New Mexico , " and make it as difficult and uncomfortable as possible for you to leave the beaten path and approach these treasures ? I have experienced some of the accommodations and conveniences that the booklet has the cynical audacity to recommend . . . . The sad Southwest : that is the phrase that recurs most often to one 's lips when one dwells upon this region . Beauty is itself inspiriting ; yet if there be a beauty in itself melancholy , it is the beauty of the inoccupable desert . There is a sharp distinction to he drawn between this and the black desert , say , of central Oregon , or the " bad lands " of North Dakota , which the devil seems to have created for an easy lesson in discouragement . This has an asthetic , almost a mystical value , and is totally lacking in the sardonic . On the other hand , the private question one asks is not , as in the bad lands , " What can man do with this ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the slow persistence of history , " What has man done with this ? " In New Mexico the immediate answer does not make for optimism . What man has done with it is all about you . The answer to the question is two dying civilizations , and a third which , so far , is only feasting on their corruption : the Pueblo Indian ; the Spanish Mexican ; the American , who is usually either a politician or a sentimentalist . Before the bar of judgment the sentimentalist will fare better than the politician , for , as Senator Walsh of Montana has recently reminded us , " You can not impeach a man for stupidity " ; but one comes to consider it a nice question whether the Pueblo Indian will not suffer as much from his misguided friends as from his cynical despoilers . The best citizens of New Mexico , by all accounts , arc the members of the old Spanish families . They are rapidly being shorn of their power and their estate ; and none of the invaders , apparently , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaders could not break into a genuine , if alien , aristocracy even if they would . Certainly one comes to feel that life in New Mexico would be humanly and socially tolerable only if one could contrive to establish relations with tke survivors of the old Mexican aristocracy . New Mexico is , all in all , a wild and uncivilized state . Life is cheap , ignorant Mexican juries are easily packed , and if a sheriff grows ( which seldom happens ) too zealous in behalf of law and order , it is pretty difficult , in the end , to find out who killed him . The politicians of New Mexico have never had an enviable reputation . Their chief activity has usually been lining their pockets at the expense of the Indian . The state 's most distinguished political figure at the present day is , one supposes , ex-Senator Fall . Senator Bursum , to be sure , achieved some notoriety recently with his unsuccessful Indian bill ? which was nothing like so bad as the uninformed publis , stirred up by the " friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bursum Bill was faulty ; but it was frankly a compromise , a makeshift way of dealing with a situation that had grown legally and practically intolerable ; and the manifesto against it which emanated from Santa Fe was certainly as faulty as the bill itself . The Indian has been ill served by his friends , and one is sometimes inclined to pity an Indian Bureau , however incompetent , which has to stand between the rapacious politician and the devotee who is ruining the Indian morally , aesthetically , and socially , as fast as ever his kind heart and muddled brain will permit . I omit any reference to the men and women ? there are plenty of them ? who are merely getting a new sensation out of the Indian , and exploit him for their own excitement , amusement , reputation , and trivial sense of power . It is for the real friends of the Indian one is concerned ; for all rightminded folk must be unofficially and sincerely his friends . The red man has had hard luck ; and one sometimes wonders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew sentimental about him as we did in the old days when we destroyed him at sight if possible . We have stolen unconscionably from him ; we have also wasted a great deal of money on him . He is a very conservative person ; and to attempt to Christianize ? especially to Protestantize ? him is as silly as it is impossible . To force the Pueblo Indian to a government school is an expensive piece of stupidity . Either American education " takes , " or it does not . If it does not , he goes back to the pueblo and reverts ; if it does , he is merely miserable , for the pueblo civilization is in his blood , and his half-hearted approximations to a United States mode of life are ridiculous and doomed . The race-prejudice which is so sLrong in the Anglo-Saxon temperament is much weakened when it is a question of the red man rather than of the yellow , the brown , and the black ; yet most white people are not easily going to admit most red people to real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , in point of fact ? and they do not thereby help the Indian . Neither as a temporary toy nor as a saint and martyr will he be enabled to work out his salvation . This preoccupation with the Indian on the part of resident and tourist alike is natural enough . You may go to New Mexico convinced that the Pueblo Indian bores you , or that he is merely a vanishing problem ; determined therefuse to seek for future rather than past factors in Southwestern affairs . All through northern Arizona and northern New Mexico you will , in spite of yourself , come back to the Indian . The white American is still to a large extent his parasite ? clinging to him , whether for the sake of gain or of cheap publicity or of archaeological interest or of aesthetic pleasure . Not to the temporary resident is it given to penetrate the patios of Oteros and Chavezes ; to meet face to face , with respect and sympathy , a point of view that derives from a religious and . social tradition wholly alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain ever successfully withstood America on this side of the Atlantic ? The Spanish New Mexicans will inevitably pass from prominence and control . As the great men die , their vast holdings are broken up and parceled out . The younger generation compromises with American ways , often to its own undoing . The atmosphere of a sovereign state of the Union is not favorable to the preservation of Spanish social and domestic traits . Moreover , this northern province of Mexico was , until 1848 , literally that ; and Mexico is not quite Spain , as we all know . It has had its own prejudices against the mother country ; and in the ' thirties a Spaniard from Spain was almost more unpopular in Santa Fe than an American from Missouri . What is true of Mexico in general must have been true of the northern provinces : namely , that the purity of creole blood grew more and more tinged with the darker Indian strain . The Rio Grande had no social significance in those days , and Santa Fe was only a smaller Chihuahua farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Mexico before 1848 was what differentiates it , chiefly , now : sparser settling , a greater emptiness , the atmosphere of the outpost and the frontier , a fighting history unbroken since the conquistadores ? and the Pueblo Indian . The Pueblos may seem a meek race compared with Apaches and Comanches , but they fought in the streets of Santa Fe as late as 1837 . In the days of rival governors , rival parties , the pueblos took sides or stayed neutral ? and the attitude of a strong pueblo was a matter of real importance . Since the sixteenth century they have spasmodically fought and conquered , been bloodily reduced or temporized , planned secret revolts , sulked on their mesas , massacred their priests or protected them ? but from 1549 to 1849 they always counted heavily in the turbulent history of northern Mexico . To the Mexican resident they were important as the aboriginal and by no means impotent owners of the soil ; to the incoming American they counted , later , as the chief opportunity of the unscrupulous , the most frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vivid asset of the archaeologically minded . This is , in a very real sense , the Pueblo Indian 's country . The Indians mix happily enough at fiestas and such like with the humbler Mexicans ; and they are of course far outnumbered by the Mexican citizens of the state . They have no objection to speaking Spanish , though they often have a profound objection to speaking English . But though New Mexico is prevailingly Mexican still ? did they not , in Socorro and El Paso , celebrate our recognition of the Mexican government as spontaneously as if it had been a saint 's day ? ? the Mexican sheep-herder or farmer is a less positive creature than the Indian . He and his adobe , his sheep , his dogs , his ponies , his children , are the dusty background against which life must move . He has imposed upon this region his language or the conquista-dores imposed it for him ? and in a general way his religion and his attitude to life . But he is too ignorant , too mongrel , too indolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express in his own person the perpetual question , " What are you going to do about me ? " We are not going to do anything about him except wait for the generations slowly to oust him . He confuses the social situation , because in the smaller towns and villages he has all the votes and can see to it that his vices are not too hardly dealt with and that vengeance is not too swift . The Pueblo Indian , on the other hand , is a perpetual interrogationpoint ; and being a ward of the government he must be answered . He can not simply perish vaguely among the rigors of competitive citizenship . For all these reasons , you can not get away from the Indian in the Southwest ? not until he is quite dead . We found it useless to try , in spite of our original prejudices born of much sentimental public and private nonsense about him . The Pueblo Indian is , one gathers , a very respectable as he is certainly a very fine-looking- person . It is not he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowns objectionable ranchers in their own sheep vats , or pays so much a head to the jury For acquitting him of murder . He is very conservative , he is very proud ? and lie is not a citizen . Nor is he a rich man . An Osage Indian from Oklahoma who has struck oil and proceeds to pile his women-folk and their enormous vanity cases into an expensive car , to jaunt westward and crow , in the worst American slang , over his red kin on the reservations , is as objectionable as any human being to be met with on New York 's east side . ( Oil , they have been suggesting lately , is a contaminating thing . ) The Pueblo is a farmer ; and the scorn of what the industrial schools can teach him about agriculture is not only deep but wellfounded . It is characteristic both of him and of us that the state of California should spend large sums of money and the time of experts to determine how to save the Imperial Valley from the dire results of over-irrigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians have been quietly practicing for generations Very like us never to have observed him ; very like him never to have told . The eternal squatting on Indian lands , the vagueness of titles , the consequent piling up of litigation ? thousands of eases , stretching over . years , that no one can make head or tail of ? which it was the honest intention , apparently , of the despised Bursum Bill to find some way out of ? even if not a perfect one ? have left him , certainly , with shrunken possessions . I am not defending the Bursum Bill ; but it is clear that even its objectionable clauses grew out of , and were conditioned by , an absolutely impossible situation which was in itself worse than almost any solution . It was not the cold-blooded steal that the country was made to feet it was ; and the points made against it were often illogical and ill-taken . The big steals came earlier . No honest American citizen , one supposes , would defend our treatment of the Indian since we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Indian commissioners and Indian officials . On the whole , the government has latterly been trying to do the decent thing ? frustrated at every turn by all the people who are concerned with the Indian : concerned to rob him or concerned to protect him . In the Southwest the case is perhaps most glaring , because the Pueblo Indian is not , and in historic times never has been , nomadic . His pueblos were going strong as self-governing cities when the Spanish came ; he had developed his own religion , his own art , his own political ideals , and , living as inaccessibly as possible , he asked only to be let alone . He cared as little , really , for scalps as for the blessings of Catholicism . The conquistadores , who were treasure-mad , would not let him alone , and we all know the results . The Pueblos took over Catholic Christianity and accepted resident friars in their pueblos . They built churches , a hundred and fifty to two hundred years before California did , and the New Mexican mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted on all sides that the priests have been good for their morals , though the Indians ' Christianity is at least as eclectic as that of St. Mark's-in-the-Bouwerie . The conservatism of the Pueblo Indian is something that iL takes more than three hundred years of an alien faith to disturb . Rome , with its profound psychological insight , has permitted them ? even as it did when it converted the Germans ? to keep their paganism pretty well unimpaired . They dance before the patron saint of the pueblo ? hut the dance is what it always was in character and meaning ; expurgated a little , no doubt , out of deference to the conquering paleface . One tribe -- 'Zuni , I think ? has come out in the course of the last decades and proclaimed itself definitely non-Christian . Most of the Southwestern Indians do nut trouble to announce the fact . Here was , one can not but feel , a beautiful chance for the white man to have peace with the red man . The tribes had to go from the vast prairie country because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the Pueblo farm-lands , which were neither rich nor vast ; and the Pueblo could have gone on living his life without detriment to the social fabric . He might , in that uncoveted region , have had from ns the peace that Spain ? which would believe in hoards of gold and the Seven Cities of this- or that ? never gave him . The Indian , however , is always the first person to be stolen from because , on account of his anomalous position , he is the safest . So we lost our chance of preserving his semi-civilization unimpaired , of co-existing with him in a dignified manner . Then came the tourist , who always ruins an alien peasantry . The Indians learned to sell their wares at stations and by roadsides , and learned also to beg . The children of any pueblo stretch out their hands and whine for " cirque centavos " as you pass . Their pride has been subtly corroded by the traveler , no doubt , as has their art .. Most of the things they want to sellyou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of Japan since Japanese stuff has become a fad . The old Indian paintings and weavings had a certain beauty and quality ? but where do you find them now ? Not in the hands of the flushed sightseer , surely . Their potters and their smiths still have a knack and a conscience ? until they begin supplying a market . Then you get things as bad as the modern Japanese product in the department stores . And ? let the truth he told ? none of it was ever great art , anyhow . Their vanity may well be flattered by all the artists who have wanted to paint them , the white folk who have wanted to live in their pueblos , the misguided people who construct " pageants " out of them . The pathetic fact is that it is the less respectable Indian , or the less respectable traits in that Indian , which condescend to endure this sort of patronage . The by-product of it is to be seen in the Indian who will not let himself be photographed save at an exorbitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , is not the handsome young buck whose profession in life is dressing up as an artist 's model , or who enters into the social life of white men and women . The ones you respect arc more apt to be the real residents of the pueblo , who work their farms , cherish their traditions , depart in no wise from their own courses , and object ? not physically or formally , but temperamentally ? to white visitors . I recall with pleasure one or two older inhabitants of Laguna pueblo , their dignity , their fine manners , and their uncompromising but quite unaffected Indianness . One of them , never forgotten , is still admiringly referred to by us as " the gentleman from Laguna . " His courtesy was complete ; but I do not think he would have cared to sit at meat with us ? I hope not . The English have learned better than we the right manner with the honorable member of an alien race , which consists in respecting rather than ignoring his differences , in admitting the clash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him nor flattering him , in meeting only when and as both races can meet without offending any convention of the other . It may be said , too , that it is the Englishman who achieves this golden mean . The English woman stays out of the game ? which is a help . We Americans are apt either to despise the alien or to fawn on him ? muddling all comparative values in either case . " No good Indian but a dead Indian " is at one extreme ; going into their pueblos and living with them ( unless for official reasons ) is at the other . Only mutual disillusion can come of the latter course . Not long ago the New York newspapers , which are always rich in astonishing incident , presented us with an account of some Pueblo Indians arriving in New York on their way to Washington , and giving one of their tribal dances in the Town Hall before an interested group of clergymen and others . The episode was conceived , one fears , by friends of the Indian . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It is at such a point as this that one begins to be genuinely and unashamedly sorry for the Indian to think that perhaps he does need fending for . The occasion for this absurdity ( or indignity , if you like ) was clear enough : various Pueblo Indians were on their way to Washington in connection with a Pueblo Land bill of sorts , and their white friends thought it an excellent opportunity to show an eastern public how innocuous are the tribal dances that the government talks of suppressing . But there is a lot of tortured logic in this matter ; and if the friends of the Indian would condescend to talk things over with people officially responsible for the Indian 's welfare , they would discover that to themselves is in large measure due the threat of forbidding his dances . You find many people pulling at the Indian in different directions ; his " friends " ( rival groups of them ) ; the white men who sink their consciences while dealing with the red man , and care not what becomes of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and incompetent , who are employed to advise and teach and look after him ? and , of course , the missionaries . There is also a queer mass of public opinion , variable but bulky . The friends of the Indian say that the dances are beautiful , symbolic , harmless , and that it is cruel and stupid and short-sighted of the government to stop them . So far one quite agrees ? and continues , I may say , to agree , even though some of the dances are perhaps not so beautiful or so harmless as they are stated to be . They are the Indians ' own affair , in any case . It is currently believed among the native American residents of Albuquerque that the people of one of the obscurer pueblos ( I will not name it ) still contrive to sacrifice a living baby every year to the snake-god . This may or may not be true . If it is , the custom is neither profoundly beautiful nor wholly harmless , and no one could blame an Indian Bureau that interfered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; only from the native-born resident , who took the Indians philosophically , having known them well , collectively and individually , all his life . VOL . CLI. ? No. 902. - 14 Within a fortnight the Secretary of the Interior has declared , in answer to a petition from the San Ildefonso pueblo , that the guardians of the Indians have no intention of interfering with religious dances " or those given for pleasure or entertainment which are not degrading . " But he adds , " There are certain practices , however , which are against the laws of nature or moral laws , and all who wish to perpetuate the integrity of their race must refrain from them . " Cryptic , to say the least ; and committing the government to nothing . The real storm center at the present moment seems to be the Hopi Snake Dance , held each August on the Hopi reservation in northern Arizona , alternately on the first and third mesas ? at Walpi and Oraibi , if you prefer the names . We came too late for the Snake Dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopi Snake Dance has not much longer to run ; that the government is sure to stop it . Apart from one 's baffled desires for the Hopi Snake Dance , on whichever mesa , is one of the few things I can hardly bear to die without having seen ? one hopes that the government will have the common sense not to interfere . Their only good argument against it seems to be that preparation for it unfits the partakers for normal work during a good many weeks of each year . The snakes are entirely real and venomous ; and the only way the priests ran deal with them , apparently , is to subsist for a long time before the dance on a curious secret diet . They starve themselves into a kind of anemia no blood flows , I understand , when the serpent strikes ? and drug themselves also into immunity to the poison . While the process is going on , they are far from being able and industrious citizens . What of it ? one can not but ask . Are they not perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us an ancient ritual as by harvesting a little more corn ? A man is useful to the community by virtue of his peculiar gifts . Almost any one can raise corn and peaches , but those who can preserve and perform the Snake Dance are few . To the people who object on the score that it is a pagan ceremonial , one has nothing to say . It is a pagan ceremonial . Again , and more emphatically , what of it ? Are we or are we not going to be faithful to our original promise of religious liberty for all dwellers within our land ? It would take a Klansman , I think , to say " no " with real and pious conviction . So long as the Indian does not harm others ? and no one can accuse him of trying to propagate his faith , or of asking anyone else to develop anaemia ? he has a perfect right , under the Constitution of the United States , to pursue his private cults . The Roman Church has not seen fit , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Protestants going to be less intelligent and less tolerant ? " But they say they ' are going to stop all the dances , " some friend of the Indian says to you , in righteous and terrified wrath . To which , at long last. , one 's reply comes to be as follows : " We hope ' they ' wo n't . It would , I agree , be the last insult to a proud race that is dying , and dying in our power . But if they ' do anything so unreasonable , you will have been largely to blame . Of most of the dances no one has ever complained ? or ever would have complained effectively , unless you had begun to capitalize , artificialize , exploit them . ' They ' are probably justified , to some extent , in saying that the dances take the Indians away from their farms , and spoil them , and may eventually bring them to poverty . This arid land takes a lot of arduous cultivating . People who dance all the time ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dance and to farm until you came . Now the pueblos are crowded with white folk on feast-days ? and of course the temptation is to charge a thumping admission fee instead of raising funds in a more laborious way . " Moreover , instead of piously protecting the real , the sincere , the immemorial seasonal dances , what have you done ? Created a lot of new occasions . You have invented an intertribal ceremonial at Gallup which is directly contrary to every Indian habit and tradition , and you drag them there from all over to make a perfectly meaningless festival . In September you bring them into Santa Fe to do all sorts of stunts which have no significance whatever in the Plaza of Santa Fe , precisely because the dances are religious , seasonal , and local . Abolish your silly Santa Fe pageant ; give up your idiotic invention at Gallup ; stop dressing the Indian up and bribing or flattering him into posing , in and out of season , for third-rate painters . Give guarantees to the government that you will stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , corrupting his integrity , and making a holy show of his religion ? and perhaps the government might even reconsider . " That your intentions are of the best , one does not doubt ; but mere archwology , mere aesthetics , mere taste should show you that a religious ceremony loses all validity when you remove it from the time , the place , and the occasion that it was created to fit . No person with a sense of the fitness of things is going , if he can possibly help it , to witness a corn dance or a rain dance or whatever in the Plaza of Santa Fe or the Town Hall of New York , or watch the tribes ' get together ' in the tourist season at Gallup . " You might suspect from the Santa Fe handbook that the Snake Dance is hard to get to . But no one would suspect that discomfort and delay attend on him who would visit Acoma . It must be confessed , however , that Acorna is one of the things for which one must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things , one finds Albuquerque the best point of departure . Indeed , it is so hard to get to any point on the Santa Fe ( except the Grand Canyon , which is pampered with every sort of special service ) that the wise thing to do is , once having contrived to get to Albuquerque , to stop there and make it headquarters for all one 's exploration of northern New Mexico and eastern Arizona . It is not within the scope of this article to dwell on Acoma . Let it merely be taken as illustrative of the whole pueblo problem . The legend that the Acomatis lived originally ? very far back , since we know Amnia , was going strong in 1549 ? on the Enchanted Mesa , seems to have been exploded , like many other cherished theories . Few people have been on top of the Mesa Encantada , and descriptions of human vestiges thereon are not well substantiated . Acoma itself is difficult enough of access ; you climb up the cliff-side , using handholds and toe-rests cut in the rock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some official person at Laguna , who preferred the young product of the government schools to its unreelaimed elders . Horizontally fifteen miles from a road , across gashed and hummocky desert , vertically five hundred sheer feet in air , it is what you might call separated from the blessings of civilization . The church of Acoma , is a well-known marvel ; said , thirty years ago , to be actually the largest church ( in area ) in the United States , it took forty years , in the seventeenth century , to build , and every cubic inch of earth for the adobe walls and roof , every foot of timber for the beams , had to be carried up the face of the cliff on Indian backs . The CaliforniaMissions , so much lovelier , so much newer ? and so much more ephemeral ? than these of New Mexico , become historically insignificant compared with the queer pueblo churches which have been in active use ( some of them ) for nearly three hundred years , and are still served by mission priests . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going ; the roof ' rr In sore need of repair , and there was no money anywhere ? two thousand dollars being the needed sum ? to repair it . There are , you see , no Daughters of the Pueblo Revolution ( they had a first-rate Revolution in 1680 ) to form chapters and preserve monuments of Pueblo history ; there is no A coma Association , with lady regents , to protect one of the oldest churches we possess . I have been told , however , since beginning this article , that certain wide and kind individuals in Denver have guaranteed the repair of the Acoma church roof . I am told also that " they " are threatening to move the inhabitants of the pueblo from Acoma to Acomita in the plain where their farm lands lie . I can not say ? for desert distances are hard to judge in desert air ? how many miles away Acomita lies ; but it would be hard work to commute from the top of the Rock of Acoma to any place whatsoever , even to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Rock will be maintained . Nowhere else , however , can St. Stephen have quite such a setting and such a prelude for " his " dance . Por though there are no Delight-Makers at Acorns , there is the Rock ; and while the torntoms beat in the underground council chamber , the whole cliff thuds and resounds and reverberates about you and beneath you , and you stand at the heart of a monotonous and thrilling vibration of which you can not determine the place or the source . It is rather too bad that there is not an Acorns Association . And one is inclined to side with the friends of the Indian to this extent : that one wishes the government had a little more respect for the Pueblo Indian as he is , and less for its conception of the hybrid he ought to be . " In 1540 Coronado made gunpowder in Bernalillo . " He mined his sulphur at Jernez , I believe . Bernalillo is still there ? in fact , it is the county-seat of Sandoval county , and must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a year . Bernalillo , Algodones , Domingo , La Bajada -- these Spanish villages stretch along the desert between the near Sandias and the distant Jemez , and if one were looking for a Thebald one might do worse . An acre of desert should come cheap ? some sheep-owning Spanish or American magnate might cut one off for you , without noticing it , from his quarter of a million ? arid a Mexican can build you an adobe shack in your own back yard . All you do , as has been said , is to convert your own land from the horizontal to the vertical position . You had best not have too much wealth and gear ? but who does in a Thebaid ?  - -  for the morals of Sandoval county concerning life and property are not quite up to specification , and though the capital is not far away , the benign influence of the legislature does not seem to extend to any great distance . You would expect to be killed in Bernalillo or Algodones if you made yourself unpopular ; nor would you expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in any such village why you should be unpopular if you neither splurge nor criticize nor shout English at your neighbors . The climate is gorgeous , the landscape lovely , maiiana is the watchword , and if you are neither ambitious nor quarrelsome nor censorious , I fancy you will be let alone . To make yourself quite solid you would probably need only to make friends with the priest , and now and then to show that you are human ? go off at night with your burro ( you can buy one for fifty cents in Sante Fe ) to the neighboring turquoise mine and chip out a few bits of blue stone for yourself . The turquoise mine belongs to Tiffany , but Fifth Avenue is very far away , and the Indians never seem to lack cheap turquoise for their personal use , though one is quite sure they do not buy it from Tiffany . It would also be well , one supposes , to pretend not to see any Penitentes , if one did see them ? but the Penitentes are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the far folds of the hills . The Church , I believe , has almost won its long campaign against the flagellants ; though you still hear the old tales of their secret political power , and still hear the classical remark that if you could see the backs of many prominent citizens , you would see them scarred . Not , however , in Bernalillo or Algodones or Domingo , in all probability , would you spend Good Friday among the Penitentes . When the Indian has at last perished and the Mexican has been submerged , what will be left here in New Mexico ? Only with infinite and costly irrigation does it become white man 's country in the productive sense . The climate and the beauty will attract more and more parasites ; but they are not the people who make a state and a civilization . Will there come a day when English , not Spanish , is the convenient tongue outside the rare cities ? Will the fiestas give place to the movies and the adobe walls revert to the soil whence they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three centuries , with the Pueblo Indian for sole rival ; and , compared with the Anglo Saxon , these two are brothers-in-arms . The patron saint of the pueblo receives on his feast day a curious medley of honors : the Mass first , then a pagan dance before his image , and most likely in the afternoon a wholly Spanish fie.eta , with the Indians looking on , sympathetic but incurious . It is difficult to foresee the future , even after the Indian shall have passed . The Mexican will stick on much longer than he , and the adobe shack will outlast , probably , the Hopi house . All we shall do , no doubt , is to obliterate the graces and preserve the drawbacks of the old Spanish civilization . We shall eventually see to it that all our Spanish citizens are desperately poor ; for that is our pleasant little conquering way . IL is all a matter of the intensity of our desire , the richness of the loot . If they strike oil ? or mine their coal ? God help them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely and profitless , it can for a time remain Spanish ? as it is now .
