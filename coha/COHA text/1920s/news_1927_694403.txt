txt The selection of the jury , ten men and two women , in whose hands rests the fate of . Albert B. Fall , former Secretary of the Interior , and Harry F. Sinclair , oil operator , who are on trial here charged with conspiring to defraud-the Government in the lease of the *Teapot Dome naval oil reserve , was completed today . It is not the youthful aggregation the Fall-Doheny jury was . The oldest is John J. Costinet , a tailor , 67 , while the youngest of the twelve is Gardner P. Greafell , 16 , an electrical cable splicer . The ages of the women members were not disclosed . Practically the entire morning session was spent in filling the jury box , and then was heard for the first time in the record of the oil lease controversies , the expression . " Ladies and gentlemen of the jury . " The entire afternoon session of the court was consumed by Owen ' J Roberts for the Government and Martin W. Littleton ' of the Sinclair defense group in'outlining the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins , probably sometime tomorrow afternoon . Mr. Littleton was still talking when court adjourned and will resume tomorrow morning . In the Dolieny-Fall conspiracy trial last year the jury was locked up . This time the jurors are to remain at liberty , but Justice Siddons of the Criminal Branch of the District of Columbia Supreme Court warned them to hear nothing , say nothing and read nothing about what transpires before them in the weeks the trial is expected to continue . It is an earnest appearing jury and from a standpoint of breadwinning is made up of a brick mason , an ice salesman , a floor walker , two automobile men , a leather worker , a taller , a bakery man , a plumber , an electrical splicer , a telephone instructor and a piano store clerk . ' List of the Jurors . " The list of jurors is as follows : Mrs. ANNELA BAILEY , 2.700 Connecticut Avenue . clerk in a piano store . JOHN 3 .

Mrs. Bailey and Miss Heaton appear to be about thirty years of age . As was the case yesterday , talesmen who had read of the case , and they were in the majority today , and who had formed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused were promptly told to step aside . Fall Sits Silent in Court . The scene in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like that of yesterday . Ex-Secretary Fall , facing Justice Siddons , seldom looked to right or left . He had little to say even to his counsel . Quietly he came hr.to court , and just as quietly he left when the court was adjourned . Mrs. Fall was not with him today , but is ill in her apartment . Because of this Justice Siddons prolonged the noon recess twenty minutes so that Mr. Fall might have a little more time with her . Mr. Sinclair watched every move by his own counsel as well as that a the Government attorneys . With him today was Sheldon Clark of Chicago , who was one of the - judges named by the Illinois Athletic Commission to render judgment in the Tunney-Dempsey fight . As Mr. Clark sauntered into the legal inclosure today he broke into a broad smile when somebody ? it was . not Mr. Sinclair  --  dared him to count fourteen . Mrs. Phoebe Sinclair , 80 , mother of the defendant oil man , was again in court , as alert as her son in following every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York , who appeared yesterday as counsel for H. M. Blackmer. former Chairman of the Board of the Midwest Refining Company , who has defied Government efforts to have him return and tell what he knows about the Continental Trading Company , Ltd. , transaction , was not in court today . George Gordon Baa1 tle " observed " alone ' for the missing oil man . Declaring that , as Secretary of the Interior , Fall " had favored Sinclair and disfavored the Government , " Mr. Roberts , addressing the jury in a conversational tone , outlined the trend the Government 's case will take as it is unfolded . He did not talk longer than twenty minutes . He had not - proceeded far when it became certain that the Continental Trading Company transaction , out of which the Government charges Fall received $230,500 , will play a commanding part in the battle to win a conviction . On the other hand , Mr. Littleton , made it clear that the defense will emphasize the drainage feature of the issue and will seek to prove that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger of leakage of the Government-owned oil into privately owned or leased fields adjacent to the Teapot Dome reservation . Mr ! Littleton had not reached the Continental phase of the issue nor did he refer- today - to the national defense argument which was advanced in the Fall-Doheny trial , and is expected to be brought forward in this case . At the close of-Mr . Littleton 's presentation of the defense program tomorrow it is expected that he will disclose the names of the witnesses ' to be called for the defense . It is expected that this list will include those of Edwin Denby , former Secretary of the Navy ; Captain John K. Robison , retired , who was Engineerin-Chief of the Navy at the time of the Teapot Dome negotiations , and Dr. H. Foster Bain , who was Director of the Bureau of Mines during Mr. Fall 's tenure of office as head of the Department of the Interior . The first witness to be called by . the Government will be Mr. Finney , Assistant Secretary of the Interior ; Colonel Robert M. Stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Indiana , who was one of the guarantors of the Continental deal , will probably take the witness chair Friday . Roberts Defines " Conspiracy . " Beginning his opening address to the jury . Mr. Roberts traced the history of the indictment . declaring that in the pending case the word ' conspiracy " means an agreement " by any ' means or in any manner " to defraud , the United States Government . He indicated that circumstantial evidence will figure largely in the Government 's case . " The Government will prove to you that the reserve was set aside for the exclusive use or benefit of the navy , " said Mr. Roberts . " The Court and you will take notice of the act of June 4 , 1920 , which puts that thing under the Secretary of the Navy , and the Executive order by which President Harding attempted to transfer that from the Navy to the Interior Department , of which Secretary Fall was the Secretary . " Then the Government will prove that Secretary Fall assumed full control of the thing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am in charge here and will do as I please and see best for these reserves . ' " We will show that the usual people in the department who had to do with these things had nothing to do with it , and that Fall and Sinclair alone conducted the negotiations . " Mr. Roberts related in some detail ' how ' the ? . Government expects to prove that the Teapot Dome- lease was drafted largely in the New York ' office of Mr. Sinclair . Furthermore , he said , the Government will bring evidence before the jury to prove that subsequent to the lease of the reserve to Sinclair other responsible persons and corporations made inquiries as to the possibility of bidding for the lease of the Teapot Dome and they received information of an evasive nature , in at least one instance Fall telling a prospective bidder he would have a chance , and this , added Mr. Roberts , was after the Sinclair lease was signed . " We will show you , " continued Mr. Roberts , " that between October , 1921 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own people in his own department that there was no necessity for making this lease for the purpose of protecting the reserve from draining , and in spite of that he writes , in his own hand , that it is necessary to do it to protect the reserve from draining , and orders a lease on the whole reserve  --  not on the borders , but on the whole reserve  --  immediately on the heels of the report that such a thing is not required . " Turns to Bond Transaction . Following a reference to the secrecy which the Government charges featured the entire Teapot Dome transaction Mr. Roberts came to the Continental Trading feature of the case . " The lease , " he said , " became ef- I fective about the middle of April , 1922 , and the Government will show you that on top of the irregularities which I have briefly outlined , that immediately after the lease became effective in the month of May , 1922 , Secretary Fall 's own son-in-law , Mr. Everhart , appeared at Pueblo , Col. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Fall , . turned over to him , in part , and used to pay his debts , ? in part , of the cattle company which he owned in New Mexico . " We will show you that those bonds were obtained as dividends in a. transaction which I shall try now to make clear to you , and which is a little bit complicated . Along in November , 1921 , a . man named Humphreys had a big oil field in Texas . He had , I think , more oil than money . He found it necessary to sell some of his oil . He got in touch with the Standard Oil interests and the Sinclair Consolidated interests , the Prairie Oil and Gas interests , to sell some of that oil . And as a result of negotiations he arranged to sell 33,000,000 barrels of that oil as it was produced from the wells . " When Humphreys came to sign the contract he was told that he was to sell that oil to the Continental Trading Company . Ltd. , of Canada . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' Well , ' they said , ' you make the contract with that company . ' He and his lawyers said , ' Well , we do n't know that company . ' ' Well , ' they said , ' the Sinclair and the Crude Oil Purchasing Company will guarantee the Continental 's performance . ' Mr. Humphreys said , ' I know those companies . I will take their guarantee . I will sell the oil to anybody that they say . ' So Mr. Sinclair was present at that meeting . " Mr. O'Neil of the Prairie Oil and Gas Company and Mr. Stewart of the Standard Oil Company of Indiana put their guarantee on that contract . That contract called for $1.50 a barrel for 33,000,000 barrels . On the same day the Continental Trading Company , which was organized in Canada on that day  --  not before ? the Continental Trading Company sold that oil at not less than $1.75 a barrel to the . Prairie Oil and Gas 1Company , thus making a profit of at least 25 cents a barrel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gas Company paid for the oil on the 20th of We month and the Continental paid Mr. Humphreys on the 15th , so that the company made a profit of 25 cents a barrel , cash in hand . " We will show you that all of that money was invested in New York , not at the home of the company in Canada , because we will show you that the company had no records of any kind , but in New York that money was invested in Liberty bonds , not in anything but Liberty bonds at per cent. , and that from time to time those Liberty bonds were distributed around to the extent of $3 , - 000,000. and . in 1922 $300,000 worth of those Liberty bonds went out , May 8 and 17 , and of that $300,000 worth we identify over $200,000 worth in Mr. Everhart 's hands in Pueblo , Col. " We shall show you that the only persons in the negotiation of the Continental Trading Company were James E. O'Neil of the Prairie Oil and Gas Company , Robert W. Stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Midwest Refining Company , and Associated Press Photo . ALBERT B. FALL , Former Secretary of the Interior , on Trial Under Charges of Defrauding the Government in Oil Leases . Harry F. Sinclair , the defendant here . " And we will show you that none of those persons had any dealings with Mr. Fall but Mr .. Sinclair . And we will show you that of the some $3,000,000 in Liberty bonds we find over $200,000 worth of the bonds , with the same numbers , turned over in Pueblo , Col. , for Mr. Fall 's benefit something over ten days later . $25,000 More Sent to Fall . " But more than that , the Government will show you that Mr. Fall resigned from office in the Spring of 1923 ; that no sooner had he resigned from office than Mr. Sinclair 's officers , and Mr. Sinclair , desired to employ Mr. Fall to go to Russia with him on some-oil matter , and that Mr. Fall was interviewed for that purpose , if you believe the defendant 's then statement or the officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ahead . But at that time we shall show you , Mr. Fall being in Washington . Mr. Sinclair being in New York , $25,000 of the same kind of Liberty bonds were sent to Mr. Fall 's bank at El Paso , Texas . " It is stated that it was not a fee , and it was not expense ' money ? but that it was a loan to Mr. Fall , because he could n't go to Russia until he bought a couple of pieces of land in Texas , and , therefore , he had to have this money . But we will show you that although that was the story given out , that money went into Mr. Fall 's bank account , and all but about $2,500 of ? it stayed there for a year and was not used . " We shall show you , further , that Mr. Fall sold those bonds and banked the money for twenty-five thousand and six hundred some-odd dollars , and we shall show that Mr. Fall gave Mr. Sinclair a note for $25,000 . But more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sinclair .. We shall show you that the note was given to Mr. Zevely , Mr. Sinclair 's , counsel ; but - until the Senate , investigated the matter it was not known a note had been given , and no payment has been made on it . " ? Mr. Littleton , following a brief recess of the court , began his opening speech for the defense . " Congress , " said Mr. Littleton , " having armed the Secretary of the Interior and the President of the United States with the power to lease the lands : surrounding the reserves , committed to the Secretary of the Navy the day and the Power of preserving the oil within the reserves against the seeping and the taking of the oil out by wells on the outside which might be driven . " We will show you , . not as the Government counsel said in his opening . statement , that . Mr. Fall early sought to control the disposing of these reserves , but that Secretary Denby himself , who is not indicted in this case or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his superior , and made the suggestion that these reserves , which had been committed to him by the act of June 4 , 1920 , and for the handling of which ' there was no equipment-in his office , and for the handling of which there was the traditional and age-old equipment in the Interior Department , should be Placed in the hands of the Interior Department for administration for that very reason . " Secretary Denby originated the idea , as we will show you by the evidence , and presented it to President Harding . " Mr. Littleton made reference to the drainage situation in the Elk Hills ( Cal. ) reservation , in leading up to the drainage situation which the defense contends existed at the time in the Teapot Dome reserve . He mentioned Dr. Bain , Carroll Weegemann and A. W. Ambrose , former officials of the Bureau of Mines , who , it was indicated , will be among the witnesses who will come forward to substantiate the contention that the Teapot Dome was facing a leakage peril . Refers to Pacific ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Littleton began leading up to the national defense feature , namely the fear that Captain Robison , at one time holding the rank of Rear Admiral , entertained that the United States was threatened with war in the Pacific . " When Admiral Robison , " Mr. Littleton continued , " went over to the Navy Department on Oct. 1 , 1921 , he went over carrying with him the knowledge and information that came to him in the War Plans Committee work and of the plan which the General Board had made for the defense of the country . " Moreover , it will be shown to you that this secrecy , which my friend spoke of in his opening , and which he speaks of here as a badge of fraud in this case and as evidence of a conspiracy between my client and Secretary Fall ? it will be shown to you that from the very beginning , when Admiral Robison left the War Plans Committee and went to the Secretary of the Navy , he was carrying with him the knowledge of the secret plans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he came to deal with the oil question , as it re-lated to naval defense , of course , the two plans merged one with the other , as I shall show you later . Says Robison Took Charge . " Admiral Robison came the first of October . Ho came on a verbal order by Secretary Denby , which order put him in charge of the naval oil reserves and of the petroleum situation . He came by verbal order , which was later confirmed . He immediately got in touch with the Secretary of the Interior and with his department . " He read and studied , as the evidence will show , and made himself familiar with the situation with respect to the reserves and with respect to the oil situation generally , because he was to stand now , and from now on , in this picture as the man representing the Navy Department in the conferences about those leases . " And the evidence will show , and I anticipate by this much , and let me say this now : The evidence will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or almost daily contact with Secretary Denby , at least four or five times a week from the beginning to the end , kept Secretary Denby posted in detail as to all the negotiations that were going on with respect to these leases . " When Sinclair went to Three Rivers , N. M. , in the latter part of December , 1921 , to see Fall , he ' went there , Mr. Littleton said , to confer with him regarding certain interests he had in the Osage ( ( Okla. ) oil lands . Before he elaborated on this and supplied the details , Justice Siddons announced the hour of adjournment and asked Mr. Littleton to suspend until 10 o'clock tomorrow morning , when the trial will be resumed .
