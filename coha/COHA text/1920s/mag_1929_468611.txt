IN a previous essay I described " modernism " as a tendency of poets to keep the values of their poems to themselves ? or offer them to the reader incidentally , to be enjoyed as a kind of colored puzzle . If all literature may be described as a verbal communication of values , the modernists may be described as absorbed in the values to the neglect of the act of communicating them . They are unsociable poets , unfriendly , and in extreme cases their language approaches that of the insane or idiotic . Indeed , the word idiot means in its origin nothing more slanderous of the character of much of their poetry than " private . " But that describes only one-half of its character , the unlovely half . The modernists are distinguished not only by their ahsorption in values , but also by the kind of values in which they are absorbed . It seems to me that what they are cultivating in their privacy ? and what they communicate at such times as they do consent to a social relation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated , so far as that is possible , from values which belong properly to practical , or scientific , or prose language . By pure poetry I do not mean a " mystic essence " supposed to reside in certain lines which happen to be beautiful or moving , or to suggest perfection , for reasons not easily analyzed . " La fine de Minos et de Pasiphoe " is the line usually chosen by French critics to illustrate this mystic essence . ( You will destroy it neatly if you neglect to sound the final e . ) In English we have " Kubik ) , Khan , " or " The sedge is withered from the lake , And no birds sing . " And lately we have been instructed that T. E. Hulme , with the few rather watery poems he published in a volume with Ezra Pound , entered into the inner shrine of the temple of this mystic essence . To my mind this way of talking about poetry , proper to the age of alchemy , has in this day a rather sophomoric flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By pure poetry I mean to designate a real thing ? a way of using words that can be identified , and to some extent at least explained , by the psychologist . Perhaps the best way to see what poetry is in its own nature , is to imagine it originating in the incantations of medicine-men or magicians . Names are supposed by all primitive people to have an occult power over the thing named . They have the power of evoking the being of that thing and compelling its obedience . But in order to do that , they have to be just the right names . And the medicine-man or shaman or poet-magician , who had also some of the gifts of the quack-doctor , would get the idea spread abroad that he knew the right names of things . He could bring rain , for instance , by standing out under the sky and saying the right words . That is a very wonderful and exciting way to use words , and yet totally unrelated to science or everyday practical communication . The ordinary way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TENDENCY TOWARD PURE POETRY 0,23 to say , " Well , do n't you think we 'd better find the old sprinkling pot ? " And the scientific way is only a little more elaborate , " Let 's build a darn and dig ditches and irrigate the whole valley . " But the sorcerer , the poet , this wonderful and deep-eyed man who is in touch with the heart of reality through language , gets out there in the middle of the valley , and spreads out his hands , and says words which do not mean a thing . And then the rain falls . Or else it does n't . In any case it ought to . And among almost all primitive peoples , all human tribes who have not yet passed under the affliction of statistics , the opinion is that if the poet has got the right words , the rain does actually fall . Mr. Briffault tells us that the Greek words ode and epode , the German lied , the Eng/ish /ay , and similar words in other languages , have meant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carmine meant indifferently verses or " charms . " Votes was a magician or a poet . In several languages the word for magician , like the word poet itself , means " maker . " And so we infer that the poet was so named , not for any of the edifying Carlylian reasons that we tried to believe in when we went to school , but because this sing-song man was supposed to he able to bring things into being by naming them . He was a sorcerer ; his rhyming language was a magic spell ; his function was not to edify soulful people , but to " produce the goods . " That was undoubtedly the principal mother-lode from which poetry arose . But that is not what poetry is . In the mind of that verily gifted magician , naming the raindrops out of the sky , there was an actual vision of the drops he named . His words did have the power to evoke the being of things ? in his imagination . For him , moreover , the line between imagination and sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sorcerer , but something also of a child . And he had an interest in raindrops , an absurd and altogether important interest in raindrops , which badnothing whatever to do with agriculture or the problem of watering the soil . He had a like interest in the sky . It is not too much to say , in view of what we know about his successors , that he sometimes loved the sky , in a mournful way , even when it failed to rain . Whether with joy or sorrow , he loved -- or was fascinated by ? the whole business of " being " in this world . And , like all people who love a thing , be enjoyed calling it pet names . Set free by his profession from any other very steady occupation , he developed a great habit of sitting around thinking up pet names for things -- the names that would most exactly and vividly evoke them into his imagination . That was how he kept awake when be was not working , and that was pure poetry . The American Indians believed that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep was a mere hint or routine application of its almost omnipotent occult powers . And yet there were pure poets among the Indians also , as is shown very aptly by Natalie Curtis in her Indians ' Book . She quotes the following song or tuneful incantation designed to bring rain , from a young Navajo poet : deleted material The magical intention or , at least , the surviving form of such an intention , is here quite obvious . And yet the poet , when he was questioned by Miss Curtis as to the " meaning " of his song , had nothing whatever to say about this form or intention . " My song , " he said , " is about butterflies flying over the cornfields. and over the beans , One butterfly is running after another like the hunt , and there are many . " I set this answer apart from my text , because it is , in effect , another poem ? another pure act of realization through language , The poet is asked for the meaning ? or as Walt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his poem , and he only attempts again , and by a fresh manipulation of the magic contained in names , to evoke into consciousness an experience of the being of the things he named . It is to this original and pure form of poetry that the modernists , with all their sophistication and their city things , are tending back . They too are abandoning purports , themes , meanings , preachments , all that so recently and extravagantly admired stuff of edification that led Matthew Arnold almost to the definition of poetry as a " criticism of life . " In place of a criticism , these poets are offering us in each poem a moment of life , a rare , perfect or intense moment , and nothing more . They offer us awakening ? they even offer to keep us awake for the few moments while we are reading their poem ? and that seems to them enough . Poetry is a thing like music or the morning , which stands in no need of meaning anything for those who are sensitive enough to perceive it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that " the modernist poets are bringing a new and heightened consciousness to life . " Hart Crane describes the whole province of the poet 's art as " added consciousness and increased perceptions . " Neither of these poets clearly conceives what he is saying as a psychology of poetry , or holds with any continuous force to its implications . But at least for a moment they forget the mystic essences , and speak of their art with the same modern intelligence withwhich we speak of " locomotives and roses . " For the length of that moment they confess themselves to be devotees of pure poetry ? understanding by that term the original simple thing as it emerged from the practical employments of the magician. deleted material It is only necessary to select such an example as this ? where by accident , or by some momentary act of grace , a modernist poet has actually communicated his whole poem ? in order to see what in their privacy these poets are trying to do . They are trying to surrender themselves , more utterly than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience . And it seems quite possible ? to judge , at least , by this exquisite example from E. E. Cummings ? that they are succeeding . Of course all poets have written pure poems upon occasion . No genuine poet has ever accepted the obligation to support with a criticism of life his every offering of an increased perception of it . 11r . George Moore not long ago compiled an Anthology of Pure Poetry which contains verses from all the great periods of English literature . Through a predilection for lyrical song ? or perhaps through an influence from the mystic essences ? Mr. Moore left out of his volume some of the more rich and slow-moving of pure poems . He left out Keats ' " Ode to Autumn , " which says absolutely nothing throughout thirty-three lines except just this one very thing ? Autumn . But , upon the whole , his anthology accords with our definition , and it proves that there is nothing new in abandoning meanings , or the problem of adjusting man with his environment , and devoting oneself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new thing about the modernists is the extreme to which they carry this devotion . Pure poetry is not an occasional exploit with them , but a regular duty . In all their poems you feel , not so much a tendency as a determination , to avoid all valid or verifiable judgments or opinions about anything . In their critical essays they boast of this attitude of detachment . They call it " intellectual " or " classical " ; but I do not think we need to take that very seriously . When T. S. Eliot dismisses Bernard Shaw and Bertrand Russell as emotional " and offers in the name of " intellect " to replace their arduous thinking about important problems with his wilfully meaningless poetry , his narrowly literary learning , and rather pedantic prose , it is quite obvious that words are being misapplied . Still more obvious , when our American propagandist of modernism , Gorham B. Munson , lays Randolph Bourne away among the " emotional , " and brings forward Ernest Hemingway and E. E. Cummings as showing a revival of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Munson had the intellect of which they boast , they would not be found , fifty years after the birth of genetic psychology , still taking seriously this old-fashioned dichotomy , intellect versus emotion . Virginia Woolf repudiates her predecessors as resolutely as T. S. Eliot , but she puts her finger more knowingly upon the line which divides her fromthem . In order to complete their books , she says , " it seems necessary to do something . " The reader must " finish them actively and practically for himself ? ' The kind of book she admires in contrast is " complete in itself ; it is self-contained ; it leaves one with no desire to do anything . " In short , it has no meaning , in the technical and matter-of-fact sense of the word . The modernists not only abandon meanings more persistently than other poets , but they abandon , whenever they want to , those logical and grammatic forms which are the established vehicles of meaning . They allow their poems to move without the support of these emptied vehicles ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past imparted to the procession of the poet 's images . Let us compare , for illustration , a pure poem by E. E. Cummings with one by William Shakespeare . And let us give Shakespeare ? for the moment ? the precedence . here is a pure poem which he contributes to Mr. Moore 's anthology : When all aloud the wind doth blow And coughing drowns the parson 's saw And birds sit brooding in the snow And Marian 's nose looks red and raw , When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl , Then nightly sings the staring owl , Tu-whit ; Tip-who , a merry note , While greasy Joan doth keel the pot . This is , you see , in its grammatical form , not a poem at all , but a scientific observation . When all those first things happen , exactly then , simultaneously with them , the owl sings , " Tu-whit ; tu-who . " That is , I believe ? provided neither the owl nor the roasted crabs are moving with the speed of light ? an accurate observation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be able to read it through with composure , and concede that Shakespeare was sane and of sound mind , and that he might perhaps have discovered something original or important about owls ? about the hibernal habits of the strigidce , I should say ? if he had carried his observations a little farther . Poetic people know that the scientific observation , as well as the grammatic form which conveys it ? the compound declarative sentence ? is a mere accidental convenience , a piece of old clothes-line upon which the acts of imaginative realization are strung . Now the great revolution accomplished by the modernists , in their more extreme and Presbyterian devotion to pure poetry , has consisted of occasionally throwing that piece of old clothesline away . In Mr. Cummings ' realizations of a mouse , for instance , we are not led astray from the poetry by any compound declarative sentence , or by any sentence whatever : deleted material Here the scientific people will throw up their hands in disgust ? the thing does n't make sense . But poetic people will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making sense about mice to the zoologist . In still another way the modernists carry pure poetry to an extreme . Pure poems in the past have always been single or closely unified moments of realization . If two or more of these moments were united together , some narrative or argumentative connection was supplied . The modernists unite them arbitrarily , at the dictate of taste or a purely creative impulse . They pile up poems out of imaginative moments asarchitecture is piled up out of blocks of stone and stone images . T. S. Eliot 's " The Waste Land " appears to me to be such a work of purely creative architecture . Most of his admirers ? alominated by the traditional opinion that long poems must be held together by some narrative or conceptual thread ? find it necessary before they can enjoy this poem to tell themselves that it is a treatise on the futility of human enterprise , or the decline of western civilization , or the discontinuity of modern life . They attribute this meaning , not to anything the poem says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a treatise on the discontinuity of modern life you do not have to write a discontinuous treatise . In order to expound in poetry the thought that human enterprise comes to nothing , you do not have to compose poetry that comes to nothing . For me the essential distinction of " The Waste Land " ? in so far as it is something more distinguished than a " passionate cross-word puzzle " ? is that it expounds nothing . It means nothing . It is a symphony of pure poems composed as freely in the air as symphonies of musical sounds and phrases are composed . The attempt to attach a meaning to its very meaninglessness ? to make of T. S. Eliot the prophet of a sort of philosophy of fragmentism ? is but the last gasp of the practical intelligence drowning in a sea of pure poetry . T. S. Eliot himself , to be sure , has not wholly escaped from the bondage of the meaningful tradition . He feels obliged to pose in his " Notes " as a sort of scholarly wizard with meditative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . This also , 1 think , should not be taken too seriously . Other modernists in their character as critics have made the same mistake . Allen Tate , in discussing his friend Hart Crane 's poems , says that " the vision often strains and overreaches the theme . " To this the English modernists reply that , on the contrary , " Mr. Crane is preserving his vision from a theme . .. the movements of his poems are the fluctuations of surfaces : they give a sea sense of externality : the moon , frost , tropical horizons . . . " That is the true way , and I think the only way , to receive the values of these wilfully pure poems ? poems which steadily refuse to criticize life , which abjure even grammar and logic as a bondage , and which evolve upon threads of connection as tenuous as those of a musical symphony . Remember that they are the legitimate children of a magic incantation . They have abandoned their pretense to call forth actual events and objects into the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire of practical science . They remain proud . They refuse to deck themselves out with meanings . They stand there , offering you nothing ? only themselves , and that only if you will surrender to an invisible spell . IIf It is absurd to describe this arrant and absolute revolt of the motive in the heart of all poets against the central mechanism of practical civilization , meaningful language , as a neo-classic revival , a return to the eighteenth-century tradition , a revolt against the tyranny of the general reader . That is a poor and weak way to defend a crusade that takes its force from the aboriginal fountains of life . The revolt is not against the tyranny of the general reader , but against the tyranny of the practical mind . Instead of describing it as a return to the eighteenth-century tradition , it would be more adequate to say that there have been throughout human civilization three fundamental schools of poetry ? three distinct positions of the poet . First he employed his meaningless but life-enhancing words , wider the impression that they performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical common sense of the race . That was the first school of poetry ? the incantation school . When the belief in word magic declined , he began to offer his words as a kind of colored clothing in which to dress up meanings , and make them more alluring and exciting . Even when he did not actually intend a meaning in the creation of his poem , he would look around until he found one and stick it in somewhere ( as Poe confesses he did ) , because it was now only in this way that he could justify himself to the practical common sense of the race . That was the second school of poetry ? the meaningful school . It has held the center of the stage throughout the historic period . The people in our world to-day who are most boldly gifted in the poetic use of words are attempting to go back to the forms of the incantation , but without the pretense that their words have power to evoke real objects or events . They form a third " school " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , although their hearts were old when civilization began . They should be called by some name to indicate that they are interested in poetry as a thing by itself ? a realization of life through imagination and language ? distinct both from science and sorcery . If this is a true account of the tendency toward pure poetry , its association with a more trivial Cult of Unintelligibility was natural and almost inevitable . The commonest function of words is to communicate practical meanings . This function has determined the whole growth and structure of language ; poetic communication has been ritual or incidental . To cease communicating these practical meanings without also ceasing to communicate would require a rather dexterous discrimination . It would require at least that the poet should know what he is trying to do , and that he should have some sense of the special nature of his material . A poet who knew that he was trying to get rid of the practical meaning in words ? their perfectly , automatic stimulation of action , or active attitude , in those who hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would devote a great deal of attention to the strategy of communication . The modernists , who do not know exactly what they are trying to do , and who talk about words as though they were a material as simple in its values as dyed chalk or porcelain , have followed the opposite course . They have abandoned meanings and at the same time ignored the strategy of communication , as though these two things were one and the same . It is against this obtuseness of theirs , this foolish confusion , that I have attempted to initiate a gentle rebellion of the reader in these two essays on the Cult of Unintelligibility and the Tendency toward Pure Poetry . . . . It seems to me IV that the tendency of poetry to make itself independent of meanings is deeper and has endured longer than the movement called " modernist ? ' It began in the " art for art 's sake " talk of the nineties ? if not long before that , in the abandoned sentimentalism of the pre-Raphaelites . An impression prevails that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence , against the devotees of art for art 's sake . But I think , in the world of artistic creation , the opposite was true . There was a realization that in their preoccupation with sin , their exaggerated delight in a freedom from moral meanings , these people of the nineties were feeble in their own impulse and superficial . They were exemplifying the very bondage to morals which they denounced . They were failing to see , moreover , that morals is but one kind of practical thinking . The deeper tendency , of which their sinful and delightful excitement was a mere top-ripple , is the tendency of art to declare itself independent of , and irrelevant to , all practical thinking and all actual truth . Artists are no longer sages , and they no longer wish to be . They offer us no guidance , no instruction , not even adirected inspiration . They offer us a " heightened consciousness , " an " added or increased perception . " They deride us as antique and rural bumpkins if we ask them what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not only aspiring , but in our day they are actually moving , toward the position occupied by music . Painters can find no more contemptuous name for a painting which they do not like than " literary . " Poets can find no language but that of painting in which to express their own new aims . It is a universal flight from meaning hi which the poets ? because meaning inheres in the very material of their art ? inevitably lag behind . But their revolt , although so recently become violent enough to assail its last enemy , the logic of grammar , is only the culmination of a deep and general tendency of all contemporary art . There are two reasons for this tendency , and for its culmination in modernist poetry . One is that the meanings which poets used so confidently to clothe in the bright colors of their experience are no longer convincing . The old codes and creeds have ceased to command the artist 's mind . The intellectual world is disillusioned ? deeply , as never before . I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a very stiff fight in order to defend his vision against a theme . There has been no vast multitude of themes besieging his restless pillow , begging him with the old passion and conviction to give them a poetic utterance . It is so with him , and it is so with the other poets ? the older ones going back to Arthurian legends to escape the problem of mean- I ing anything in this modern world , the newer ones bluffing it out with a hollow-voiced glorification of the machine ? a mere piece of bravado . What could be more pitiful than the attempt of civilized man to make an ideal of the tool which he invented ? He invented the tool to create with . What then shall he create ? An imitation of the tool , an expression of the influence of the tool , a reflection of the age that is dominated by the existence of the tool . What a reduction to absurdity of the grandiose ambitions of an ingenious and self-bewildered savage ! A creative artist really at home in a machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing to me ? He would ask : What shall I do with these machines ? The poets and dramatists of the New Masses and the New Playwrights Theater , in their loudly conscious attempts to exemplify the effects of machinery upon them ? to make a crusade of this subjection to influence ? seem more distracted than revolutionary . You feel that in the depth of their hearts there is one poem they would sincerely love to be able to utter : He maketh me to lie down in green pastures , He leadeth me beside the still waters ; He restoreth my soul . Deprived by their education of the possibility of saying that , they are , like the modernists and like those who have fled to the legends of Arthur , saying essentially nothing . Poetry is abandoning meanings because there are no meanings enshrined in the poet 's heart as truth . That is one reason . And the other is perhaps only the same re , - son more thoughtfully expressed . Science is becoming unintelligible to the poet , it is becoming absolutely alien to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do securely believe in to-day . We believe in the new physics , the new chemistry , the new astronomy . We believe in Bohr and Lorentz and Einstein . But we can not understand them . Teachers of the new systems are kind-hearted enough to tell us that Newton and Copernicus were as difficult for the people of their day as Einstein is for us , but we know that this is not true . You can draw pictures of the Copernican universe . You can make diagrams of the Newtonian physics . When it comes to units of " space-time " and curves passing into the fourth dimension , the imagination drops back . It is not geometry any longer , it is algebra . And algebra is the farthest that you can go in language from suggesting the experience of things . It is the farthest from poetry . The ordinary intelligence by which men live is at a loss among these meanings abstracted from life . The poet 's intelligence , disposed by its essential character to cling to the experienced qualities of things , is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truths we believe in to-day because he can not understand them . And if he could understand them , he would find that they can not be sung . They can not be realized by the imagination . The intrinsic and aboriginal conflict between the two ways of using words , the poetic and the practical or scientific way , has become absolute . Einstein is unintelligible because he has gone to the extremes of pure science . The modernists are unintelligible because they have gone to the extremes of pure poetry . The common man , the survived savage , his mind a quaint mixture of color and meaning , of poetry and science , stands bewildered between these prodigies . He does not know what to put in the cup of his curiosity or his life thirst . . . . He is wiser in a way than either of them , for he knows that there is a conflict , a trouble , a slightly insane separation of knowledge from experience , a problem to be solved . Poetry will not die in this conflict , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like other artistic movements ? although less quickly than some people imagine ? modernism will give place to new creative tendencies . Grown-up poets will not permanently content themselves with writings , no matter how rich in vividness , which seem as deliberately impotent as words without an active meaning seem . An impulse to make their poems virile will prevail over the impulse to make them pure . And out of this there will arise ? if I may be foolish enough to attempt a prophecy ? two new schools or tendencies in poetry . A mystical reactionary school will profess to have a meaning planted in these modernist poems , an ultra-logical , arduous , occult meaning , an escape from the confinements of the cerebrum , not by returning to the varieties of pure experience , but by flying out through the skull into some supernal region inhabited by a knowledge still more pure . There are signs that this school of poets , linked with the " mystic essence " school of critics , have begun already their work of retarding the progress of human intelligence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twentieth century will be the placing of " literature " on a plane superior to science . " Literature will lay truth open upon a higher level . " And Gorham B. Munson , professional evangel of modernism , leads us by the gentle strings of literary criticism straight into the dancing prayer-meetings of Gurdjiev and Orage ? professional evangels of anti-science , wizards of the cult of the new psychosophy . Another kind of poet will emerge , I think , from the weariness of modernism ? a poet more like Goethe than any other poet of the past , though not too like him . He will know the difference between poetry and science . He will know when he is doing one thing and when the other ? when and to what end he is combining the two . He will know what he is doing . In that he will differ sharply from the modernists . But his language will be brilliantly enriched and liberated by these experiments in pure poetry lying behind him as a tradition .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
