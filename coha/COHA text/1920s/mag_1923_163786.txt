Robert C. Benchley , literary buffoon of the brightest motley , is deserting the third row , aisle ( critic 's seat ) for the opposite side of the footlights . It became public property last week that Life 's theatrical commentator has accepted an engagement with the forthcoming Music Box Revue . <P> Mr. Benchley 's metropolitan theatrical experience includes brief appearances in No , Sirree and The 49ers . Both were melanges stirred together by the critics for the benefit of themselves and their friends . His act " in one " ( all by himself ) where he comes before the curtain and reads the Treasurer 's report of finances , is rated as supreme burlesque . He will repeat it in the Music Box and do a bit with Frank Tinney , as well . <P> Mr. Benchley has long been known as the brightest contributor on the staff of Life . He is the author of a number of books of humor , of which Love Conquers All is the latest and best . He is a Harvard graduate , class of 1912 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show ( the first in three years ) would be entitled Stepping Stones and that the comedian 's daughter , Dorothy , would make her debut in the cast . Despatches from Rome indicate that the filming of The Eternal City ( from Hall Caine 's novel ) is attracting masses of curious natives .
