Two voices , quite different , quite typical , spoke , last week , in England . <P> Canadian Voice . The Vice Chancellor of Oxford University sat attentively in a reserved seat , surrounded by the more or less hoary Doctors , Proctors and Heads of Houses . Supported in the rear by a begowned mass of the lesser learned , Sir Robert Falconer , President of Toronto University , delivered a professorial lecture . <P> His address was on Canada and her nationalist spirit , was delivered under the title : The United States as a Neighbor . He voiced the attitude of his country , often taken for granted or ignored in the U.S. , the attitude of a nation conscious that it has grown to its majority : <P> " Today the United States does not stand on these Americas as the leader of young nations who look to her for protection against Europe . It is doubtful if the Latin Republics of the Southern Hemisphere would willingly accept her as a protector-ess . . . . <P> " Over against the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing members on these American continents - Canada , the British West Indies and British Guiana . . . . <P> " If a dispute were to arise with one of the Caribbean republics of such proportions as to demand the intervention of Britain as the head of the Commonwealth of Nations , would the United States step in and assert her sole right to settle it ? This was what she did in the Venezuelan matter. * In the future , Canada might have a very great interest in the solution . Foreign policy is rapidly becoming an affair not of Britain alone , but of the Britannic Commonwealth . <P> " Insofar as the Monroe Doctrine refers to Brazil , the Argentine , Chile and Peru , Canada would probably stand aside . It is the future of the West Indies that concerns her . If it should ever happen that any of the islands now owned by other European nations should become salable , the Canadian might find his own interest leading him to urge Britain to purchase it , and he might be unwilling to admit that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " All this leads up to another position which has been prepared for but not yet occupied-the appointment of a Canadian representative at Washington . " <P> British Voice . Characteristically different was the attitude of an Englishman , an attitude not infrequently expressed in England of late . An unnamed correspondent , writing for the Spectator , London weekly owned by J. St. Loe Strachey , declared : <P> " Powerful forces - premeditated and unpremeditated-are at work for a union of the two great nations of the American continent . United States capital is n't the least of these factors . More than 500,000,000 of American money now is invested in the Dominion ; and it is expected that , before 1925 is out , another 100,000,000 may be added . . . . <P> " Pan-Americanism , too , is busy . Its elaborate organization in Washington seldom sleeps . It has no direct connection with the American Government , yet American politicians wink at operations of the Pan-American Bureau within a stone 's throw of the Capitol . . . . <P> " They Canadians know perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join the United States , they would only have to say so .
