Ill-cooked eggs , cold toast , no drinking water , no milk , no soup , no jam , no jelly- upon such things and conditions did the Secretary of War have to spend attention last week . Such things and conditions had been found to exist at Walter Reed General Hospital , the Army 's largest medical establishment . <P> Walter Reed Hospital occupies a large scrubbily-wooded tract at the far end of 16th Street , Washington , near the District of Columbia-Maryland line . It is composed of central stone buildings surrounded by numerous one-story frame houses . Commanding is Brig. - General James Madison Kennedy , U. S. M. C. <P> The hospital was named in honor of Major Walter Reed ( 1851-1902 ) , Army Surgeon , who was dispatched to Cuba in June , 1900 , to learn the causes of yellow fever ( " yellow jack " ) and whose discovery that the disease was transmitted by Stegomyia calopus ( mosquito ) paved the way for the slaying of that " yellow dragon " and the construction of the Panama Canal . Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the place named for him are taken men hurt and broken in the nation 's service . Wives of Army men travel thousands of miles to bear their children there , with free and excellent medical attention . Last year 237 Army babies were born at Walter Reed . Calvin Coolidge Jr . died there ( 1924 ) . <P> Some three months ago complaints of Walter Reed patients reached the ears of Senator David Aiken Reed , chairman of the Military Affairs Committee ( no kin of the late Major Reed ) . The complaints were : insufficient food of poor quality , " wormy " fruit , no milk to drink , squelching of patient criticism . <P> Secretary Good had the Reed charges investigated . Last week he answered Senator Reed specifically , telling which charges had been found true , which untrue . True conditions acknowledged over the Good signature included the following : <P> " No water was served in the dining room , " no soup had been served for " several months , " no milk for drinking " for more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at breakfast , this not with the intention of furnishing hard-boiled eggs but because the cooking arrangements were such that by the time the eggs in the bottom of the large cooking utensils have been removed , they have been allowed to cook beyond the soft-boiled stage . " <P> " Socalled ' scrambled eggs ' were uninviting . The eggs were not really scrambled but were broken and mixed with milk and then beaten and cooked , resembling egg custard more than scrambled eggs . " <P> " The understanding of the patients that only one egg was allowed for breakfast . . . was justified , since only one egg per individual was placed upon the tables and the patients did not understand they might obtain another egg upon request . " <P> Secretary Good added : " The inspector has concluded that criticism of the mess was warranted . . . . As to all other complaints the inspector has reached the conclusion that they are not justified by the actual facts . . . . The hospital is rendering a fine service to its patients . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the attention of the commanding general of the hospital and have instructed him to remedy them at once . . . .
