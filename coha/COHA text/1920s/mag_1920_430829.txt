STRAUSS was never the fine , the perfect artist . Even in the first flare of youth , even at the time when he was the meteoric dazzling figure flaunting over all the bald pates of the universe the standard of the musical future , it was apparent that there were serious flaws in his spirit . Despite the audacity with which he realized his amazing and poignant and ironic visions , despite his youthful fire and exuberance ? and it was as something of a golden youth of music that Strauss burst upon the world ? one sensed in him the not quite beautifully deepened man , heard at moments a callow and plebeian accent in his eloquence , felt that an unmistakable alloy was fused with the generous gold . The purity , the inwardness , the searchings of the heart , the great religious sentiment of beauty , present so unmistakably in the art of the great men who had developed music , were wanting in his work . He had neither the unswerving sense of style , nor the felicity of touch , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exacting artist . It was apparent that he was careless , too easily contented with thematic material , not always happy in his detail . Mixed with his fire there was a sort of laziness and indifference . But , in those days , Strauss was unmistakably the genius , the original and bitingly expressive musician , the enginer of proud orchestral flights , the outrider and bannerman of his art , and one forgave his shortcomings because of the radiance of his figure , or remained only half-conscious of them . For , once his period of apprenticeship passed , and all desire to write symphonies and chamber music in the styles of Schumann and Mendelssohn and Brahms , to construct operas after the pattern of  | Tannhauser and Parsifal , had gone out of him , this slender sleepy young Bavarian with the pale curly hair and moustaches had commenced to develop the expressive power of music amazingly , was making the orchestra speak wonderfully as it had never spoken before . Under his touch the symphony , that most rigid and abstract and venerable of forms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analytical power , its literalness and concreteness of detail . It was describing the developments of a character , was psychologizing as it had hitherto done only in conjunction with poetry or the theatre . Strauss had made it represent the inflammations of the sex illusion , comment on Nietzsche and Cervantes , recount the adventures , somersaults , and end of a legendary rascal , portray a hero of our time . He had made all these intellectual concepts plastic in a music of a brilliance and a sprightliness and mordancy that not many classic symphonies can rival . Other and former composers , no doubt , had dreamt of making the orchestra more concretely expressive , more precisely narrative and descriptive . The Pastoral Symphony is by no means the first piece of deliberately , confessedly programmatic music . And before Strauss , both Berlioz and Liszt had experimented with the narrative , descriptive , analytical symphony . But it was only with Strauss that the symphonic novel was finally realized . Neither Berlioz nor Liszt had really embodied their programmes in living music . Liszt invariably sacrificed programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was too trammelled by the classical concepts , the traditional musical schemes and patterns to quite realize the symphony based on an extra-musical scheme . His symphonic poems reveal how difficult it was for him to make his music follow the curve of his ideas . In Die Ideale , for instance , for the sake of a conventional close , he departed entirely from the curve of the poem of Schiller which he was pretending to transmute . The variations in which he reproduced Lamartine 's verse are stereotyped enough . When was there a time when composers did not deform their themes into amorous , rustic , and warlike variations ' ? The relation between the pompous and somewhat empty Lament and Triumph and the unique , the distinct thing that was the life of Torquato Tasso , is outward enough . And even the Mazeppa , in which Liszt 's virtuosic genius stood him in good stead , makes one feel as though Liszt could never quite keep his eye on the fact , and become finally  | engrossed . in the weaving of a musical pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , an exception . Berlioz , too , failed on the whole to achieve the musical novel . Whenever he did attain musical form , it was generally at the expense of his programme . Are the somewhat picturesque episodes of Harold in Italy , whatever their virtues ? and they are many ? anything but vaguely related to the Byronism that ostensibly elemented them ? The surprisingly conventional overture to King Lear makes one feel as though Berlioz had sat through a performance of one of Shakespeare 's comedies under the impression that he was assisting at the tragedy , so unrelated to its subject is the music . And where , on the other hand , Berlioz did succeed in being regardful of his programme , as in the Symphonie Fantastique , or in Lelio , there resulted a somewhat thin and formless music , a music without much intrinsic value . But Strauss , benefiting by the experiments of his two predecessors , realized the new form better than any one before him had done . For he possessed the special gifts necessary to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place , a miraculous power of musical characterization . Through the representative nicety of his themes , through his inordinate capacity for thematic variation and transformation , his playful and witty and colourful instrumentation , Strauss was able to impart to his music a concreteness and descriptiveness and realism hitherto unknown to symphonic art , to characterize briefly , sparingly , justly , a personage , a situation , an event . He could be pathetic , ironic , playful , mordant , musing , at will . He was sure in his tone , was low-German in Till Eulenspiegel , courtly and brilliant in Don Juan , noble and bitterly sarcastic in Don Quixote , childlike in Tod and Verklarung . His orchestra was able to accommodate itself to all the folds and curves of his elaborate programmes , to find equivalents for individual traits . It is not simply " a man , " nor even " an amatory hero , " that is portrayed in Don Juan . It is no vague symbol for the poet of the sort created by Orpheus or Tasso or Mazeppa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Juan Tenorio . The vibrant brilliant music of the up-surging light-treading strings , of the resonant palpitating brass , springs forth with a lithe , virile march , reveals the man himself , his physical glamour , his intoxication that caused him to see in every woman the Venus , and that in the end made him the victim as  | well as the hero of the sexual life . It is Till Eulenspiegel himself , the scurvy comic rascal , the eternal dirty little boy with his witty and obscene gestures , who leers out of every measure of the tonepoem named for him , and twirls his fingers at his nose 's end at all the decorous and respectable world . Here , for once , orchestral music is really wonderfully rascally and impudent , horns gleeful and windy and insolent , wood-wind puckish and obscene . Here , a musical form reels hilariously and cuts capers and dances on bald heads . The variation of Don Quixote that describes with wood-wind and tambourine Dulcinea del Toboso is plump and plebeian and good-natured with her very person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding suave variation that describes the knight 's fair , sonorous radiant dream of her . There is no music more plaintively stupid than that which in the same work figures the " sheep " against which Don Quixote battles so valiantly . Nor is there any music more maliciously , malevolently petty than that which represents the adversaries in Ein Heldenleben . So exceedingly definite is the portrait of the Hero 's Consort , for which Frau Richard Strauss , without doubt , sat , that one can aver without even having seen a photograph of the lady that she is graced with a diatonic figure . And certainly the most amusing passage of the Sinfonia Domestica is that complex of Bavarian lustihood , Bavarian grossness , Bavarian dreaminess , and Bavarian good nature , the thematic group that serves as autoportrait of the composer . And just as there seemed- few characters that Strauss could not paint , in those days , so too there seemed few situations , few atmospheres , to which he could not do justice . A couple of measures , the sinister palpitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood-wind , the dull flickering of the flutes , the labouring breath of the strings , and we are lying on the death-bed , exhausted and gasping for air , weighed by the wrecks of hopes , awaiting the cruel blows on the heart that will end everything . Horns and violins quaver and snarl , flutes shrill , a brief figure descends in the oboes and clarinets , and Till has shed his rascal-sweat and danced on the air . The orchestra reveals us Don Juan 's love affairs in all their individuality : first the passionate fiery relation with the Countess , quickly begun and quickly ended ; then the gentler and more inward communion with Anna , with the boredom resulting from the lady 's continual demand for sentiment and romantic posturing ; then the great night of love  | and roses , with its intoxicated golden winding horns , its ecstatically singing violins ; and finally the crushing disappointment , the shudder of disgust . The battle in Ein Heldenleben pictures war really ; the whistling ironical wind-machine in Don Quixote satirizes dreams bitingly as no music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his madness , and smiles a conclusion ; in Also Sprach Zarathustra it piles high the tomes of science and waltzes with the superman in distant worlds . And then , though less fecund an inventor than Liszt , less rich and large a temperament than Berlioz , Strauss was better able than either of his masters to organize his material on difficult and original lines , and find musical forms representative of his programmes . Because of their labours , he was born freer of the classical traditions than they had been , and was able to make music plot more exactly the curves of his concepts , and to submit the older forms , such as the rondo and the theme and variatiobs , more perfectly to his purpose . Compositions of the sort of Till Eulenspiegel , Tod and Verklarung , and Ein Heldenleben are both solidly made and yet narrative and dramatic , place the symphonic poem in the category of legitimate musical forms . The themes of Till grow out of each other quite as do the themes of a Beethoven symphony or of Tristan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the symphonic poem something of what Wagner did for the opera . And not an overwhelming number of classical symphonies contain music more eloquent than , say , the " sunrise " in Also Sprach Zarathustra , or the final variation of Don Quixote with its piercing shattering trumpets of defeat , or the terrifying opening passage of Tod and Verklarung . For Strauss was able to unloose his verve and fantasy completely in the construction of his edifices . His orchestra moves in strangest and most unconventional curves , shoots with the violence of an exploding firearm , ambles like a palfrey , swoops like a bird . There are few who , at a first hearing of a Strauss poem , do not feel as though some wild and troubling and panic presence had leaned over the concert hall and bedevilled the orchestra . For , in his hands , it is no longer the familiar and terrorless thing it once had been , a thing about whose behaviour one could be certain . It has become a formidable engine of steel and gold , vibrant with mad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Violin music launches swiftly into space , trumpets run scales , the tempi move with the velocity of  | express trains . It has become a giant terrible bird , the great auk of music , that seizes you in its talons and spirals into the empyrean . But it was what he seemed to promise to perform , to bring into being , that , even more than what he had already definitely accomplished , spread about the figure of Strauss the peculiar radiance . It was Nietzsche who had made current the dream of a new music , a music that should be fiercely and beautifully animal , full of laughter , of the dry good light of the intellect , of " salt and fire and the great compelling logic , of the light feet of the south , the dance of the stars , the quivering dayshine of the Mediterranean . " The other composers , the Beethovens and Brahmses and Wagners , had been sad , suffering , wounded men , men who had lost their divine innocence and joy in the shambles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength gained during their fights , by hunger and frustration and agony . Pain has even marred their song . For what should have been innocence and effortless movement and godlike joy , Mozartean coordination and harmony , was full of terrible cries and convulsive rending motions and shrouding sorrow . And Nietzsche had dreamt of music of another sort . He had dreamt of a music that should be a bridge to the Superman , the man whose every motion would be beautiful . He had seen striding across mountain chains in the bright air of an eternal morning a youth irradiant with unbroken energy before whom all the world lay open in vernal sunshine like a domain before its lord . He had seen one beside whom the other musicians would stand as convicts from Siberian prison camps , who had stumbled upon a banquet of the gods , might stand . He had seen a young Titan of music , drunken with life and fire and joy , dancing and reeling and laughing on the top of the world , and with fingers amid the stars , sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old and eternally youthful figure of Indian Dionvsos . And even though Strauss himself could scarcely be mistaken for the god , nevertheless , he made Nietzsche 's dream appear realizable . He permitted one for an instant to perceive a musical realm in which the earth-fast could not breathe . He permitted one for an in- ; tant to hear ringing " the prelude of a deeper , stronger music , perhaps a more wayward and mysterious music ; a music which is superGerman and which , unlike other music , would not die away , nor pale , nor grow dull beside the blue and wanton sea and the clear  | Mediterranean sky ; a music super-European , which would hold its own even by the dark sunsets of the desert ; a music whose soul is akin to the palm-trees ; a music that knows how to live and move among great beasts of prey , beautiful and solitary ; a music whose supreme charm is its ignorance of good and evil : " For he came with some of the light and careless and arrogant tread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the musician of the new race . The man who composed such music , one knew , had been born on some sort of human height , in some cooler , brighter atmosphere than that of the crowded valleys . For in this music there beat a faster pulse , moved a lighter , fierier , prouder body , sounded a more ironic and disdainful laughter , breathed a rarer air , than had beat and moved and sounded and breathed in music . It made drunken with pleasant sound , with full rich harmonies , with exuberant dance and waltz movements . It seemed to adumbrate the arrival of a new sort of man , men of saner , sounder , more athletic souls and more robust and cool intelligence , a generation that was vitally satisfied , was less torn and belaboured by the inexpressible longings of the romantic world , a generation very much at home on the globe . For it had none of the restless , sick desire of Wagner , none of his excessive pathos , his heaviness and stiff grandeur . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , witty , diverting , exciting , popular and yet cerebral . Though it was obviously the speech of a complicated modern man , self-conscious , sophisticated , nervous , product of a society perhaps not quite so free and Nietzschean as it deemed itself , but yet cultivated and illuminated and refined , it nevertheless seemed healthful and good . The sweet broad diatonic idiom , the humour , the sleepy Bavarian accent , the pert , naive little folk-tunes it employed , the tranquil touching childlike tones , the close of Tod and Verklarung , with its wondrous unfolding of corrolla upon corrolla , were refreshing indeed after all the burning chromaticism of Wagner , the sultry air of Klingsor 's wonder-garden . And this music glittered with the sun . The pitch of Wagner 's orchestra had after all been predominantly sober and subdued . But in the orchestra of Strauss , the colour-gamut of the plein-air painters got a musical equivalent . Those high and brilliant tints , these shimmering , biting tones , make one feel as though Strauss made music with the paint brush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and brilliant and silvery , his violins scintillant and  | electric , at moments winding a lazy , happy smoke-blue thread through the sunburnt fabric of the score . His horns glow with soft fruity timbres . The new sweetness of colour which he attains in his songs , the pale gold of Morgen , the rose of the Serenade , the mild evening blue of Traum Durch die Dammerung , shimmers throughout his orchestra scores . Never have wind instruments sounded more richly , dulcetly , than in that Serenade fur Dreizehn Blaser . At a first hearing of Also Sprach Zarathustra , it seemed as though the very dayspring had descended into the orchestra to make that famous brassy opening passage . For here , in the band of Strauss , the orchestra begins to round out its form and assume its logical shape . The various families of instruments are made independent ; often play separately . The shattering brass of which Berlioz had dreamt is realized . Violas da more , haeckelphones , windmachines are introduced into the band ; the familiar instruments are used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestral composer for the first time has a suitable palette , and can achieve a brilliance quite as great as that which the modern painter can attain . To-day , it is difficult to realize that Richard Strauss ever incensed such high hopes , that there was a time when he made appear realizable Nietzsche 's mad dream of a modern music , and that for a while the nimbus of Dionysos burned round his figure . To-day , it is difficult to remember that once upon a time Strauss seemed to the world the golden youth of music , the enginer of proud orchestral flights , the outrider and bannerman of his art . For it is long since he has promised to reveal the new beauty , the new rhythm , has seemed the wonderful start and flight toward some rarer plane of existence , some bluer aether , the friend of everything intrepid and living and young , the " arrow of longing for the Superman . " It is a long while since any gracious lordly light has irradiated his person . In recent years , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of what he gave so brave an earnest of becoming . He who was once so electric , so vital , so brilliant a figure , has become dreary and outward and stupid , even . He who once seemed the champion of the new , has come to fill us with the weariness of the struggle , with deep self-distrust and discouragement , has become a heavy and oppressive weight . He who once sought to express the world about him , to be the poet of the coming time , now seems inspired only by a desire to  | do the amazing , the surface thing , and plies himself to every ephemeral and shallow current of modern life . For Strauss has not only not deepened and matured and increased in stature . He has not even stood still , remained the artist that once he was . He has progressively and steadily deteriorated during the last decade . He has become a bad musician . He is the cruel , the great disappointment of modern music , of modern art . The dream-light has failed altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentary illumination . Strauss to-day is seen as a rocket that sizzled up into the sky with manicoloured blaze , and then broke suddenly , and extinguished swiftly into the midnight . It is not easy , even for those who were aware from the very first that Strauss was not the spirit " pardlike , beautiful and swift , " and that there always were distinctly gross and insensitive particles in him , to recognize in the slack and listless person who concocts Joseph 's Legende and the Alpensymphonie , the young and fiery composer , genius despite all the impurities of his style , who composed Till Eulenspiegel and Don Quixote ; not easy , even though the contours of his idiom have not radically altered , and though in the sleepy facile periods of his later style one catches sight at times of the broad simple diction of his earlier . For the later Strauss lacks preeminently and signally just the traits that made of the earlier so brilliant and engaging a figure . Behind the works of the earlier Strauss there was visible an intensely , fierily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beautiful sensations , and the gift of expressing them richly . Behind the work of the latter there is all too apparent a man who for a long while has felt nothing beautiful or strong or full , who no longer possesses the power of feeling anything at all , and is inwardly wasted and dull and spent . The one had a burning and wonderful pressure of speech . The other seems unable to concentrate energy and interest sufpicienily to create a hard and living piece of work . The one seemed , to blaze new pathways through the brain . The other steps languidly in roadways well worn . He is not even amusing any longer . The contriver of wonderful orchestral machines , the man who penetrated into the death-chamber and stood under the gibbet , has turned to toying with his medium , to imitating other composers , Mozart in Der Rosenkavalier , Haendel in Joseph 's Legende , Offenbach and Lulli ( a coupling that only Strauss has the lack of taste to bring about ) in  | Ariadne auf Naxos . He has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unblushingly , Mendelssohn , Tchaikowsky , Wagner , even hirhself . His insensitivity has waxed inordinately , and led him to mix styles , to commingle dramatic and coloratura passages , to jumble the idioms of three centuries in a single work , to play all manner of pointless pranks with his art . His literary taste has grown increasingly uncertain . He who was once so careful in his choice of lyrics , and recognized the talents of such modern German poets as Birnham and Dehmel and Mackay , accepts librettos as dull and inartistic and precious as those with which Hofmannsthal is supplying him , and lends his art to the boring buffooneries of Der Rosenkavalier and Ariadne auf Naxos . Something in him has bent and been fouled and broken . One thing at least the Strauss of the tone-poems indisputably was . He was freely , dazzlingly , daringly expressive . And this is what the Strauss of the last years thinly and rarely is . It is not Oscar Wilde 's wax flowers of speech , nor the excessively conventionalized and stylized action of Salome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not even the libretto of Der Rosenkavalier , essentially coarse and boorish and insensitive as it is beneath ail its powdered preciosity , that wearies one with Strauss 's " Musical Comedy , " or the hybrid , lame , tasteless form of Ariadne auf Naxos that turns one against that little monstrosity . It is the generally inexpressive and insufficient music in which Strauss has vested them . The music of Salome , for instance , is not even commensurable with Wilde 's drama . It was the evacuation of an obsessive desire , the revulsion from a pitiless sensuality , that the poet had intended to procure through this representation . But Strauss 's music , save in such exceptional passages as the shimmering , restless , nerve-sick opening page , or the beginning of the scene with the head , or certain other crimson patches , hampers and even negates the intended effect . It emasculates the drama with its pervasive prettiness , its lazy felicitousness where it ought to be monstrous and terrifying , its reminiscences of Mendelssohn , Tchaikowsky , and " Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance of the seven veils , is represented by a valse lent . Oftentimes , the score verges perilously on circus-music , recalls the side-shows at county fairs . No doubt , in so doing it weakens the odour exuded by Wilde 's play . But if we must have an operatic Salome , it is but reasonable to demand that the composer in his  | music express the sexual cruelty and frenzy symbolized in the figure of the dancer . And the Salome of Strauss 's score is as little the Salome of Wilde as she is the Salome of Flaubert or Beardsley or Moreau or Huysmans . One can not help feeling her eminently a buxom , opulent Berliner , the wife , say , of the proprietor of a large department store ; a heavy lady a good deal less " damonisch " and " perverse " than she would like to have it appear . But there are moments when one feels as though Strauss 's heroine is not even a Berliner , nor of the upper middle class . There are moments when she is plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she declares to Jokanaan that " it is his mouth of which she is enamoured , " she delivers the words in her own true-hearted , unaffected brogue . Nor is Elektra more sharp than Salome , though it oftentimes is the musical equivalent for the massive and violent forms of archaic Greek sculpture that Strauss intended it to be . Elektra herself is perhaps more truly incarnate fury than Salome is incarnate luxury ; ugliness and demoniacal brooding , madness and cruelty are here perhaps more sheerly , powerfully expressed than in the earlier score ; the scene of recognition between brother and sister is perhaps more large and touching than anything in Salome ; Elektra 's paean and dance , for all its closeness to a banal cantilena , its tempo di valse so characteristic of the later Strauss , is perhaps more grandiosely and savagely triumphant than the dancer 's scene with the head . Nevertheless , the work is by no means realized . It is formally impure , a thing that none of the earlier tone-poems are . Neither style nor shape is deeply felt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusively demonstrates it than the extreme ineffectuality of the moments of contrast with which Strauss has attempted to relieve the dominant mood of his work . Just as in Salome the more restless and sensual passages , lazily felt as they are , are nevertheless infinitely more significant than the intensely contrasting silly music assigned to the Prophet , so too , in Elektra , the moments when Strauss is cruel , brutal , ugly are of a much higher expressiveness than those in which he has sought to write beautifully . For whereas in moments of the first sort the lions of the Mycenae gates do at times snarl and rage , in those of the second it is the Teutonic beer-mug that makes itself felt . Elektra laments her father in a very pretty and undistinguished melody , and entreats her sister  | to slay Klytemnaestra to the accompaniment of a sort of vats pervers . It is also in tempo di valse that Chrysothemis declares her need of wifehood and motherhood . As an organism , the work does not exist . But even the expressiveness and considerability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , is wanting in the more recent works . With Der Rosenkavalier , Strauss seems to have reached a condition in which it is impossible for him to penetrate a subject deeply . No doubt , he always was spotty , even though in his golden days he invariably fixed the inner informing binding rhythm of each of his works . But his last works are not only spotty , but completely spineless as well , invertebrate masses upon which a few jewels , a few fine patches , gleam dully . Salome and Elektra had at least a certain dignity , a certain bearing . Der Rosenkavalier , Ariadne auf Naxos , Joseph 's Legende , and Eine Alpensymphonie are makeshift , slack , slovenly despite all technical virtuosity , all orchestral marvels . Every one knows what the score of Rosenkavalier should have been , a gay , florid , licentious thing , the very image of the gallant century with its mundane amours and ribbons and cupids , its petit-maitres and furbelows and billets-doux , its light emotions and equally light surrenders . But Strauss 's music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soggy , even though it is dotted with waltzes and contains the delightful introduction to the third act and the brilliant trio . It has all the worst faults of the libretto . Hofmannsthal 's " comedy for music , " though gross and vulgar and cheap in spirit and unoriginal in design , is full of a sort of clever preciosity , full of piquant details culled from eighteenth century prints and memoirs . The scene of the coiffing is a print of Hogarth 's translated to the stage ; Rofrano 's name , Octavian Maria Ehrenreich Bonaventura Fernand Hyazinth , is like an essay on the culture of the Vienna of Canaleto ; the polite jargon of eighteenth century aristocratic Austria , spoken by the characters , with its stiff courteous forms and intermingled French , must have been studied from old journals and gazettes . And Strauss 's score is equally precious , equally a thing of erudition and cleverness . Mozart turned the imbecilities of Schickaneder to his uses ; Weber triumphed over the ridiculous romancings of Helmine von Chezy . But Strauss follows Hofmannsthal helplessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitates Mozart , affects his styles , his turns , his spirit ;  | inserts a syrupy air in the style of Haendel or Mehul in the first act ; and follows Mozart with modern comic-opera waltzes , Haendel with post-Wagnerian incantations . And , like Hofmannsthal 's libretto , the score remains a superficial and formless thing . The inner and coherent rhythm , the spiritual beat and swing , the great unity and direction , is wanting . " I have always wanted to write an opera like Mozart 's , and now I have done it , " Strauss is reported to have said after the first performance of Der Rosenkavalier . But Der Rosenkavalier is almost antipodal to Don Giovanni or to Falstaff or to Die Meistersinger or to any of the great comic operas . For it lacks just the thing the others possess abundantly , a strong lyrical movement , a warm emotion that informs the music bar after bar , scene after scene , act after act , and imparts to the auditor the joy , the vitality , the beauty of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while since Strauss has felt anything of the sort . Had the new time produced no musical art , had no Debussy nor Scriabine , no Strawinsky nor Bloch , put in appearance , one might possibly have found oneself compelled to believe the mournful decadence of Richard Strauss the inevitable development awaiting musical genius in the modern world . There exists a group , international in composition , which , above all other contemporary bodies , arrogates to itself the style of modernity . It is the group , tendrils of which reach into every great capital and centre , into every artistic movement and cause , of the bored ones , the spoilt ones . The present system has lifted into a quasi-aristocratic and leisurely state vast numbers of people without background , without tradition or culture or taste . By reason of its largeness and resources , this group of people without taste , without interest , without finesse , has come to dominate in particular the world of art as the world of play , has come to demand distraction , sensation , excitement which its false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come to give a cast to the whole of present-day life , its members pretend to represent present-day culture . It is with this group , with its drained bodies and frayed sensibilities and tired pulses , that Strauss has become increasingly identified , till of late he has become something like its court-musician , supplying it with stimulants , awaking its curiosities , astonishing and exciting it with the superficial novelty of his works , trying to procure it the experiences it is so lamentably unable to procure itself . It is for it that he created the trumpery horrors , the  | sweet erotics , of the score of Salome . It is for it that he imitated Mozart saccharinely in Der Rosenkavalier , mangled Moliere 's comedy , committed the vulgarities and hypocrisies of Joseph 's Legende . And did no evidence roundly to the contrary exist , one might suppose this group really to represent modern life , that its modernity was the only true one , and that in expressing it , in conforming to it , Strauss was functioning in the only manner granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since so many eminent modern musicians have managed to avoid that pestilential band , since a dozen other musicians , to speak only of the practitioners of a single art , have kept themselves immune and yet create beauty about them , to remain on the plane upon which Strauss began life , to persevere in the direction in which he was originally set , and yet live fully , one finds oneself convinced that the deterioration of Strauss which has made him musical purveyor to this group , has not yet been the result of the pressure of outward and hostile circumstances . One finds oneself positively convinced that it was some inner weakness within himself that permitted the spoilt and ugly folk to seduce him from his road , and use him for their own purposes . And in the end it is as the victim of a psychic deterioration that one is forced to regard this unfortunate man . The thing that one sees happening to so many people about one , the extinction of a flame , the withering of a blossom , the dulling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental energies , seems to have happened to him , too . And since it happens in the lives of so many folk , why should it surprise one to see it happening in the life of an artist , and deflowering genius and ruining musical art ' ? All the hectic unreal activity of the later Strauss , the dissipation of forces , points back to such a cause . He declares himself in every action the type who can no longer gather his energies to the performance of an honest piece of work , who can no longer achieve direct , full , living expression , who can no longer penetrate the centre of a subject , an idea . He is one type of man unfaithful to himself in some fundamental relation , unfaithful to himself throughout his deeds . Many people have thought a love of money the cause of Strauss 's decay ; that for the sake of gain he has delivered himself bound hand and foot into the power of his publishers , and for the sake of gain turned out bad music . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in the man 's life , and keeps on playing a greater and greater . But it is probable that Strauss 's desire for incessant gain is a sort of perversion , a mania that has gotten control over him because his energies are inwardly prevented from taking their logical course and creating works of art . Luxury-loving as he is , Strauss has probably never needed money sorely . Some money he probably inherited through his mother , the daughter of the Munich beer-brewer Pschorr ; his works have always fetched large prices ? his publishers have paid him as much as a thousand dollars for a single song ; and he has always been able to earn great sums by conducting . No matter how lofty and severe his art might have become , he would always have been able to live as he chose . There is no doubt that he would have earned quite as much money with Salome and Der Rosenkavalier had they been works of high artistic merit , as he has earned with them in their present condition . The truth is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pains of creation , by pretending to himself a constant and great need of money , . and permitting himself to dissipate his energies in a hectic disturbed shallow existence , in a tremor of concert-tours , guest-conductorships , money-making enterprises of all sorts , which leave him about two or three of the summer months for composition , and probably rob him of his best energies . So works leave his writing-table halfconceived , half-executed . The score of Elektra he permits his publishers to snatch from him before he is quite finished with it . He commences composing Der Rosenkavalier before having even seen the third act . The third act arrives ; Strauss finds it miserable . But it is too late . The work is half-finished , and Strauss has to go through with it . Composition becomes more and more a mechanical thing , the brilliant orchestration of sloppy undistinguished music , the polishing up of details , the play of superficial cleverness which makes a score like Der Rosenkavalier , feeble as it is , interesting to many musicians . And Richard Strauss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle down to uninterrupted composition , gets to his writing-table in his apartment in Charlottenburg every evening at nine o'clock , that is , whenever he is not on duty at the Berlin Opera . And always the excuses : " Earning money for the support of wife and child is not shameful , " or " I am going to accumulate a large enough fortune so that I can give up conducting entirely and spend  | all my time composing . " But one can be sure that when Strauss soliloquizes , it is a different defence that he makes . One can be sure , then , that he justifies himself cynically , bitterly , grossly , tells himself that the game is not worth the candle , that greatness is a matter of advertisement , that only the values of the commercial world exist , that other success than the procurement of applause and wealth and notoriety constitutes failure . Why should you take the trouble to write good work that will bring you posthumous fame when without trouble you can write work that will bring you fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advertisement and opportunism , is it not ? Reputations are made by publishers and newspapers . Greatness is a matter determined by majorities . But impress the public , but write music that will arouse universal comment , but break a few academic formulas and get yourself talked about , but write music that will surprise and seem wonderful at a first hearing , and your fame is assured . The important thing is to live luxuriously and keep your name before the public . In so doing one will have lived life as fully as it can be lived . And after one is dead , what does it all matter ? Yet , though the world be full of men whose spiritual energies have been lamed in kindred fashions , the terrible misadventure of Richard Strauss remains deeply affecting . However far the millions of bright spirits who have died a living death have fallen , their fall has been no farther than his . There is no doubt of the completeness of Strauss 's disaster . It is a long while since he has been much beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hatred to thousands of honest , idealistic musicians . He has completely , in his fifty-sixth year , lost the position of leadership , of eminence , that once he had . Even before the war his operas held the stage only with difficulty . And it is possible that he will outlive his fame . One wonders whether he is not one of the men whose inflated reputations the war has pricked , and that a world will shortly wonder , before his two new operas , how it was possible that it should have been held at all by the man . Had he been the most idealistic , the most uncompromising of musicians , he could not be less respected . Perhaps his last opportunity offered itself in the Alpensymphonie . Here was a ceremony that could have made him priest once again . Europe had reached a summit , humanity had had a vision . Before it lay a long descent , a cloudburst , a sunset of a civilization , another  | night . Could Strauss have once more girded himself , once more summoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those first grand pages that won a world to him , he would have been saved . But it was impossible . Something in him was dead for ever . And so , to us , who should have been his champions , his audiences , his work already seems old , part of the past even at its best , unreal except for a few of the fine symphonic works . And to us , who once thought to see in him the man of the new time , he seems only the brave sonorous trumpet-call that heralded a king who never put in his appearance , the glare that in the East lights the sky for an instant and seems to promise a new day , but extinguishes again . He is indeed the false dawn of modern music .  |
