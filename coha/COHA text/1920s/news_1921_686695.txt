txt Business men who have recently talked with Congressional leaders in Washington have come away with the distinct impression that the internal revenue tax bill , when it is finally introduced , will provide for drastic reduction of the surtax on individual income . In preliminary discussion of the most productive maximum for the surtax , a tentative figure of 33% to 35% had been reached . It is understood now that , as is result of the recent hearings before the Senate Finance Committee , the most recent maximum for a productive surtax is placed at 28% . Experience of collecting the taxes during the last three years has shown u heavy falling off in the amount of income returned subject to the higher surtax rates . The explanation given is simple . Men with large incomes have invested in tax-exempt state and municipal bonds instead of in business enterprises . Treasury experts figure that with a maximum surtax rate of 28% enough investment would be diverted from tax exempt securities to business securities to bring in as much in tax collections as is collected now under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tbare must of course be reduction of excess profits tax on corporations , in order to equalize mutters between individual enterprise and corporate enterprise . Details of this adjustment have not been worked out . But if 28% is adopted as the surtax maximum , it seems a foregone conclusion that the excess profits tax must be abolished . Those who bring hints of the 28% maximum for surtax rates , say nothing of the outlook for an overturn sales tax , but other indications are that the political opposition to such a tax is not as strong as it was recently . If there can be agreement on the surtax and corporation tax rates in advance of introduction of the general tax bill , it would seem that adjustment of the proper relation between income taxes and consumption taxes must necessarily involve some kind of u general sales tax provision .
