An ocean liner rounded Sandy Hook and glided up the river that leads toward the cubistic jumble of Manhattan 's skyline . No smoke issued from the two stacks . No soot begrimed the upper deckhouse ; the engineer had on a stiff collar ; the attendants who stooped among the glinting wheels and thrusting , noiseless pistons of the engine room , tried not to get their cuffs dirty and succeeded . For this was the Gripsholm , arriving on her maiden trip from Gothenburg , Sweden , the first direct oil-burning* liner to cross the Atlantic . The motive power is generated by two double-acting six-cylinder Diesel engines of a new design , the largest ever built , which use crude oil for internal combustion approximately as an " automobile uses gasoline . Each engine drives a propeller . The vessel averaged 17 knots . Its smokestacks are dummies . <P> <P> *For many years liners have used oil to heat the steam that drives the propeller , but the Gripsholm is the first big boat to be propelled directly by crude oil as a launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
