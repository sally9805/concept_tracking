For three score years and nine Mexican patriots have scanned occasionally the Constitution of 1857 , militantly transfused into the new Constitution of 1917 , and wondered if Mexico would ever be strong enough to enforce the anti-foreign clauses of those highly pan-Mexican documents . <P> President Calles has deemed Mexico potent enough to defy the foreigner at last . He secured passage for bills enforcing the anti-foreign land and oil exploitation clauses of the Constitution of 1917 , as the present year opened ( TIME , Jan. 25 ) . He ordered the expulsion of all foreign clerics ( TIME , Feb. 22 ) , relying for authority simply on the anti-religious clauses of the Constitution . <P> Since then the deportation of priests and nuns from Mexico has proceeded steadily ( TIME , March 1 , 15 ; April 12 , 19 ) . Recently this somewhat arbitrary procedure , undefined or circumscribed by enforcement statutes , was more exactly legalized by their addition . <P> Provisions of a presidential decree promulgated to take effect on July 31 : 1 ) Church property to be confiscated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3 ) No religious corporation may conduct an educational institution . 4 ) Monasteries and nunneries are dissolved . 5 ) No religious publication may publish any account of or comment on national political affairs . 6 ) There can be no religious instruction in schools . 7 ) Religious ministers shall not be able to associate themselves for political purposes . 8 ) All religious acts of public worship shall be celebrated absolutely inside of churches which shall always be under the vigilance of the authorities . 9 ) There shall be no trial by jury . <P> The Mexican Government commented : " . . . It is the purpose of the Mexican Government to keep the Catholic Church outside politics . " <P> Monks , nuns , foreign-born prelates disconsolately look for redemption to the special prayer ordained by the indignant Holy See set for Aug. 1 ( the festival of " St. Peter-in-chains " ) . <P> Trains and mules last week carried a sorry parade of downcast Catholics to Vera Cruz .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
