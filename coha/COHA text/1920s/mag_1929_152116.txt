Maana <P> TOMORROW NEVER COMES-Robert L. Duffus-Houghton Mifflin ( $2.50 ) In one of those pleasant South American republics where blood is hot and daggers sharp , Latin temperament turns law clerk into general , army-sergeant into dictator , dictator into corpse . Rafael , the law April 29 , 1929 clerk , happened to be " nephew " to the canon of the cathedral . That was powerfully to his advantage ; but his friendship for Sergeant Domingo , ancient soldier-philosopher , was to more immediate purpose . For Rafael had had the misfortune to fall in love with Vitoria of the mellifluous eyes , Vitoria whom General Hernandez had marked for his own . With the general Rafael drove , laudably , a bargain : give him and Vitoria one night undisturbed and on the morrow he , Rafael , would surrender himself for slaughter . Rafael and Vitoria had their night . Before dawn the revolution broke . Hernandez was shot . Sergeant-Dictator appointed Rafael general in his place . The wise old soldier had been predicting revolution : " To be governed at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same man for one , two , three , years-that is more than any one ought to be asked to endure . Always the same face , always the same proclamations , always the same way of stealing money . It is like having only one woman . " An effervescent story , eminently readable , Tomorrow Never Comes is running-fire satire on politics and love , Nordic inhibitions , Latin excesses .
