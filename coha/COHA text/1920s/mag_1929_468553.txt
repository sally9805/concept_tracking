THERE was no employment office . We stood outside the iron gates which were fastened with a padlock as big as a fist . To look inside ? past the time-clock , past the racks of timecards , into the twilight of the factory ? made us feel like convicts waiting for a cell . Still we were all anxious to get in . The sun was hot . If you got tired you could go back and sit down on the levee , but then you might miss your chance . So we waited and fidgeted and eyed one another furtively , and talked as strangers talk who are not especially interested in one another ; or stood with our hands in our pockets , staring up at the water tank inscribed in prim , schoolma'am 's script " Ford . " By nine o'clock there were two hundred of us . Then a man came to the iron gate , opened the lock , and stepped before us . He had a steel-trap mouth and the eyes of a petty boss . The mob grew silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The eyes slipped over us : everybody tried to catch their attention . He could n't possibly choose with any discrimination . He did n't try to . He pointed his finger at random , saying , " All right . You ... you . " Half a dozen others stepped out , smiling , extending their hands . He recognized three , beckoned to them , cried , " That 's all ! " and led the lucky five behind the bars . The lock snapped . Outside , we stood looking fixedly into the blue haze of the plant : cranes swinging , belts whirling , a chassis floating through the air , a completed car rolling by . The blue haze seemed cool , seductive . To be in itwould mean to have a job . To have a job . . ! The mob began to drift apart . Single file and double they trooped down the levee . A stubborn dozen remained . One turned to me with bitterness . If you knowed somebody , if you could hand ' em the big mitt . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He clasped and shook his own hand . " Is it like this every morning ? " I asked . " Worse . Hell , they ai n't no use of comin ' back . You can stand here all day for six months , and they do n't know you 're livin ' . You 'd think you was lucky if you got in , would n't you ? Well , believe me , kid , old man Ford do n't give you nothin ' for nothin ' . Five bucks a day , but he works sweatin ' hell out of you . You got to go round like this . " He twirled his arm in the air till he was out of breath . " You worked in there before ? " " Eighteen months . At the end of that time I was gettin ' five and a half . I guess if I 'd a stayed on for ten years more , I 'd be gettin ' six ? maybe . The hell with ' em . I would n't be comin ' out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dead , " We parted at the levee . Half a mile down the river a sugar refinery rose in a jungle of towers , smokestacks , elevators , silos . At the gate I met one of those shabby gatekeepers , the toothless old watchdogs of factories all over the world . " They taking any hands on here , dad ? " I asked . " Mebbc . A few , I reckon . " " What 're they paying ? " " They ai n't payin ' you much , tell you that . Twenty-five to thirty cents an hour . " I grunted in disdain . Once I had worked in the machine shop of a cotton mill in Tennessee : ten hours a day , the most gruelling kind of labor that wore me down , tore at my muscles , burned into my feet , so that I could barely grit my teeth and keep going ; could barely crawl home at night , swallow my food , stumble into bed . For thirty cents an hour , sixteen-fifty a week : no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm not gain to starve . " If I was you , bud , " said the old man , leaning closer , " I 'd go down and get me a job with Henry Ford . When you work there you 're makin ' somethin ' . You 're from the North , ai n't you ? Yeh , I kinda thought so by the way you talked . Me too . These factories down here , they do n't pay you nothin ' . You better go get yourself a job with Henry Ford . " It was good to feel the grass underfoot on the levee , with the river heavy and brown below , and the ships riding down to sea , silent , like big black cats , their noses in the air , their haunches curled back . The sky was deep water , and the Louisiana sun penetrated everything , drenched your clothes and stung your skin . It was hard to keep the feet going . The sun simmered in the mind . It would have been sweet to lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got to get a job . You 've got to get a job . A job job . . job .... " Br-r-r-rap ! came the iron voice of a compressed-air rivet hammer . I had drifted into a drydock yard . Ships hoisted out of the water , their secret parts laid bare and strange ; scaffolds swung under overhanging iron cliffs ; tugs butting boats about , leaning against them like a man throwing all his weight into one shoulder ; booms dipping and swinging in a drunken waltz ; locomotives , tractors , trucks : grotesque dancers in a ballet . .. one step forward , now one back , this side , that side , whoa ! whoa ! And everywhere , on the ships , on the tugs , on the drydocks , on the booms and locomotives swarmed men . Here they were tearing the roof off a bridge ; there , far below , with brushes on yards of rod , they were curving paint down a keel . In and out of hatches they crawled , grimy , sweaty , dragging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circles on the bowdecks and bulkheads , shoving their hats back , arguing . I breathed it in , sucked up its movement and energy . It whipped away my despondency . Several years ago I had said farewell to the little clique of New York artists with whom I had long shared a padded isolation . I had grown tired of theories ; art ; interminable arguments about the working classes between aesthetes who despised them and radicals who sentimentalized over them , while neither knew anything about them . I felt a need for air , for rough-and-tumble experience , for wholesome dirt and hard work . Above all , as a writer , 1 needed to get back to masses of people , to touch hands with laborers , to eat the food and share the thoughts of fully three-quarters of America . Oh , the disgust I had felt for the sterility of our writers , their precious aloofness , their faint-heartedness , their toadying to fashion and society ! Fear ? that 's what eats them up . They 're afraid . They huddle together ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personalities ? out of fear , fear . And this fear they call being civilized , sophisticated . To cut yourself voluntarily off from the great human life current is to belong to " the civilized minority . " No wonder Whitman cried you must rim , run for your life , from " the civilized minority . " And in those years I had touched the earth I was famished for . I drew incalculable strength from it . There were weeks when I could feel myself grow : tougher outside so that I could be more tender at heart ; surer of myself , so that with a world of faith , I could yet be freer in mind . It was not always easy . I have no illusions about working men ; I do n't believe I ever had any . I never expected to find in them as a class the grandeur which the New Masses exhales about them like a cloud of gold . And there have been days when I wanted to bowl for the friends I really loved , for my old books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life : days when I lay on my belly in an undershot seam of a coal mine ; days in blazing Californian canyons when my wrists swelled from swinging a shovel ; days of sweltering under the steel decks of ships in tropic waters ; and of long-drawn-out agonized fatigue in factories and stores . Has it been worth it ? I ca n't say . As I write these lines I am still in the woods , perhaps deeper than ever before . But this much I know : that among poor and toil-ridden people I have seen unthinkable heroism in the face of suffering which was shattering them , body and soul ; and now and then I have touched the grandeur of those " strong uneducated persons " who were for Whitman the flower of the nation . II Here on the river front of New Orleans I saw again the soil I was after . Climbing over several drydocks and two or three ships tied side by side , dodging workmen and booms , I found the foreman . " I 'm hunting for a job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunt features and a skin like a cooked tomato . Like so many sub-bosses in American industry , he was obviously chosen for bulk and brutality ? a born driver of men . He shot me a glance of colossal contempt as he snarled , " Ai n't got no time to fool with you now , boy . " But a few minutes later , seeing that I had n't moved , he shouted , " What can you do ? " What can you do , what can you do ? How often they bad slung that barb intome ! Barb , because I can not do anything . I was brought up on books ; I never learned a trade . I 'm ingenious enough . I love to putter around . And by puttering around I have won some deftness for my hands . I 'm half a carpenter , half an electrician , half a painter , half a pipe-fitter . Actually I 'm nothing : I could n't hold down a first-class workman 's job for five minutes . If I ever have a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to know a trade and be ready for a union . Then , if he has any dreams , any talents : " All right , kid . . . you 've got your feet on the ground now : you 'll never starve to death . The rest of the world and all of heaven is yours if you can get it . " I felt the man 's eyes travel over me . Always that same slow , incredulous , measuring look . God , why was n't I cut ont a husky and tough ? Why , in spite of everything , do I look so young ? always dubbed boy , " " bud , " " kid , " " son " ? years younger than I really am ? Why am I saddled , to my despair and chagrin , with what my friends call " the honest face of an Alger hero " ? My face has cost me a score of jobs . " Well , what are you ? Carpenter ? Mechanic ? Painter ? " I lied . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been a pipe-fitter 's helper . At least I could make a bluff with a wrench . I had to get a job . " See Marks . He 's got charge of all the pipe-fitting . " A wild search brought me face to face with Marks in the engine room , up to his ankles in grease ; a tall , dry , stringy man squirting tobacco juice and obscenity . He did n't stop for me . He did n't even look back . I ran along beside him , stumbling over valves and coils of pipe . " Ai n't got nothing , " he shouted . " Anything going to open soon ? " I shouted back . " Ca n't tell . May he busy as hell to-morrow . " Then , as he ducked through a door , he paused for a moment . " There 's a ship coming in any time now . Come around in the morning , early . " He was gone . The ship had n't come in the morning . But Marks was in better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a dollar an hour , helpers only forty-eight cents . We did n't discuss my status , but I should have been satisfied with forty-eight . That was twenty-one dollars a week , and I can live on ten or twelve . I managed to win his interest . In the end he gave me his telephone number and told me to call him up at night . The world began to look more rosy . All the way home I figured how much I could lay aside by cutting down on food and tobacco ; and how many weeks would pass before I had scraped together the two hundred dollars it costs me to live while I write a play . The ship , for all I know , never came in . The next night he told me to-morrow ; to-morrow he told me next week . -I 'll tell you the truth , bud . There ai n't nothin ' doin ' out here . Shippin ' ought to be pickin ' up now . This is the season . But it ai n't . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans was dead . For days , for weeks , I tramped from one office to another , from shop to factory to store . Nothing . Endless chases after elusive bosses . Endless waits to see them . Curt no 's . Churlish rejections . Some- ' times a flicker of hope , telephone calls , 1 promises . They all smoldered out into smudge . , " Business is dull . " " We just laid off 1 a bunch of men . " " We have n't enough work to keep our old hands going . " " Well , the election 's over now ; come around again . " " This is the season , things ought to be picking up now , but times are hard . " " New Orleans is shot . It 's the same everywhere , I guess . " Unemployment , unemployment : when I went hunting for a job that was all I heard . Wails and groans and discouragement . Yet down on Canal Street people laugh and prod one another with costly sleeves , and flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with beads and bracelets , spangles and furs , red shoes , brown hats , striped pajamas . French restaurants splash music through lace curtains . Automobile gears grind mighty choruses to the pr-r-ring of traffic signals . The " largest phonograph in the world " blares " I loved you then as I love you now . " Two lovers kiss in hundred-watt bulbs over the million-dollar lobby . The new eighteen-story hotel spins its headlight through the sky . Money , perfume , light , luxury , a torrential sweep of life : where does it all come from ? Who pays for it . all ? " You 're broke . You 've got to get a job . What 's to become of you ? Starve ? That 's absurb . In America nobody ever starves . You 've got to get a job . " How many out in the middle of this stream , all smooth , all dapper like you are broke like you ? How many thousands are hunting for jobs like you ? Jobs .. . jobs . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimless , turning corners at random , hands in pockets , half sunk in morose thoughts , yet all eyes , all ears . ( A hundred cities in America , from New York to Minneapolis , from Chicago to New Orleans , from Omaha to San Francisco have known the pound of my aimless feet on their sidewalks . Not altogether aimless , for always there are notes , pages and pages of minute notes . Most of them I never look at again . It is as if the overcharged senses were easing off their burden . ) Then I would drift into the old French Quarter . Its somber mood would dovetail mine . How furtive the narrow streets slink away down lace-iron balconies ! How bitter is its forlorn grace , the resignation of its age ! It has no tinsel , no bright-lights , no Ioud-speakers : it is n't go-getter enough : it 's been left behind . Like me it is down-at-the-heels . " Say , mister , can you stake me to a cup of coffee ? " From the arch of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come on , baby , I want to tell you somethin ' . " An imitation Greenwich Village tearoom . " Got a spare butt on , Jack ? " The match flares against his face . A taxicab driver , huddled against the damp , smooths out a crumpled newspaper under his spotlight . An old man munches his gums , staring into a show-case full of doughnuts . New Orleans , gay , fabulous New Orleans , city of Mardi Gras and romance ! Crushed , shuddering with pity , vicious under the smart of injustice , 1 would crawl up the steps to my room , crawl into bed . God , how good it was to sleep ! And in the morning : away with pity , away with moods . Action , action . You ' ve got to have courage . I would make out lists from the classified telephone directory : contractors , electricians , plumbers , oil companies , railroad yards , shipping agents . At first I would make six to eight calls a day . By nature I am shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from meeting people ; and for each interview I had to screw up my will . Sometimes I would walk up and down outside the door fighting with myself . Grown tougher , I extended the number to ten or twelve . One day I made fifteen . If a man were at all sympathetic I asked for suggestions . At the next office I brazenly introduced myself as sent from the last . I lied monstrously . Sometimes I tripped over my own lies and fled , burning with confusion . I wrote numberless applications . Oh , the senselessness of those applications ! " What did you do as a boy outside of school hours ? " " What was your father ? " ( What 's that to you ? ) " What makes you think you will succeed with us ? " ( Rubbish . I want a job . ) " State fully . . " " List completely . . . " " Do you use liquor or narcotics in any form ? " ( What idiot would admit it ? ) Nothing ever came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dead . " I can still remember my rage when I read one morning in the newspaper a report by the Louisiana bureauof the Department of Labor on the employment situation . Factories everywhere operating at full blast ; everybody working ; everybody happy . Well . . here and there a slight surfeit in unskilled labor ( that means negroes in the South , and any Southerner will assure you that " niggers can get along on nothing " ) . But in general , prosperity : that great American mirage , prosperity ! All our wealth spins slowly down a vortex into the diamonded hands of a few , and we bellow , Prosperity . The more arid the desert , the more shimmering the mirage . And our newspapers , what pusillanimous rags they are ! How the good quick brains that write them cringe before the money that pays for the advertisements ! One day you are warned against the calamity-howlers , the professional belly-aehers . The next day ? oh , discreetly , discreetly ? you are urged to push your business enterprises , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slack in employment may for the health of the community be absorbed . " My last dollar was gone . I acquired a hang-dog air . I saw insults where none was intended . And this I knew was disastrous : above all , you must keep up a front . I borrowed ten dollars from my landlord , a homely old French doctor who radiated benignity ; and with a terrible surrender of pride , I wrote back home for more . I have a blind horror of debt . To be in debt : that means that even when I get a job , what I can lay aside above my living costs I must pay out again instead of saving for the next play . The next play is always the big thing . I live , I work , I skimp , I dream always for the next play . How I clung to those borrowed nickels as they slipped away ! I made budgets which , to my anguish , I never kept . I washed my own linen . I avoided street cars as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee and doughnuts for a dime . For lunch a ten-cent sandwich . At night , for a quarter , a dozen raw oysters over a bar and a cup of coffee . Thank God for Bayou Cook oysters . But I was hungry , always hungry . My stomach clamored for more food . My hard , restless body balked against this shortage of fuel . I would weaken and give way : first an apple , then some dates , a bunch of carrots , a duster of raisins . In the end , for the same money , I could have had meat and satiety . Instead , all I had was a stomach-ache and that agonized remorse which follows my lapses of will . In despair I would then throw my money away , a whole half-dollar at a time on a miserable movie or a magazine which , an hour later , I would hurl in disgust across my room . My room was my one solace . It was small , dark , bare . Its besmirched white walls added to its bleakness . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to a balcony overlooking a half dilapidated Creole courtyard . Yet here after the chagrin and futility of the day , was peace and solitude . On the way upstairs I would sometimes stop to greet the doctor , who would talk to me about his early years of globe-trotting , or about French books and writers , or his slant on life , shrewd , still somewhat French-provincial , yet big-hearted , warm . His wife would join him , plump , gray , laughing like a little girl . " You find something ? No ? Oh ! " She understood , she and the doctor had had hard times too . " You find something yet , you see . " And her laugh was full of comfort . How good it was to feel their affection around rue ! How good it was to talk to somebody without the need of " selling yourself . " " Selling yourself " . . . that gorgeous American phrase . On the dresser she had placed a piece of fruit cake for me or a slice of pare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would lie on my belly in bed and read . From the library I had drawn Rolland 's Jean-Christophe . Poverty , joblessness , rebuffs , hunger , despair , everything melted away . Only Chris-tophe existed . How I suffered with him through those first weeks in Paris ! Was n't New Orleans for me the gehenna that Paris had seemed at first to him ? How I rejoiced with him when he found the charming and melancholy Olivier , whom I too grew to love ! And when , at midnight , I laid the book tenderly aside , what courage to face the next day I had absorbed from Christophc 's stormy courage ! It was not only my emotions and my mind that were aroused . The book bolstered up my will , steeled my determination . " Let 's see , to-morrow ? to-morrow I 'll look up the rest of those shipping agents and those contractors I jotted down from that sign on St. Charles , where they 're driving the piles . " Ah , to have had a friend like Christophe or Olivier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books you read really become apparent . It is then that a great book takes you away from a bruising world , and yet brings you back to it , refreshed and strengthened . Weary , despondent , lost in a swamp , you see the sudden miraculous glow of a lantern ; and with a fierce joy you know that someone else has wandered that wilderness before you , someone with surer step to find his way . You take new heart . You will find your way out too . Letters began to come . Friends to whom I had written of my troubles sent money and , better yet , that priceless aid known as contacts . There used to be a time when I scorned contacts . What , cast my pride , my independence to the wind , go toadying for patronage ? My pet illusion was that I could blow into a strange city and convince the first-comer ( anyhow , the second ) that here was a man of intelligence and ability who ought to get a job . I am wiser now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred thousand has even the faintest flair for judging at first-hand brains or character or skill or any quality except the most superficial . Ability has to be pointed out to the ordinary man . His real genius lies in steering a bee line for the unmistakably tenth-rate . I suppose that explains why Mozart died of poverty and Beethoven looked like a tramp ; while Puccini and Verdi splashed in wealth and fame . What the average business man needs is for his customer or his friend to write , " Look , here 's your man . He 's good . Besides , he 's So-andSo 's friend . Hire him . " Then , if he needs you , you 're hired . So armed with letters announcing to the world of influence that / was a " promising young writer , " I marched out to see the first of the contacts . This was the head of an importing concern , a large man , round , smooth , soft , pompous . He leaned back in his chair and talked about art . How business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what asses they make of themselves when they do ! " At a luncheon club the other day , " he said , ? we got to talking about the plight of artists in New Orleans , and do you know , one fellow got up and moved that we give them our ' moral support . ' That made my blood boil . I got up and said that that was just the chief trouble with us business men : we are always giving artists our moral support when what they need is something more tangible , something to butter their bread with . Moral support ! " he snorted . Then I asked him to help me find a job . He was taken back , visibly annoyed . With the smoothest kind of insolence he answered that " artists are always taking advantage of business men . They think because they 're artists everything ought to be handed them on a platter . " I tore up the names he wrote down for me when I reached the street . I realized that to him , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts is a social accomplishment , something linked up with luncheons , clubs , tuxedos , above all : good taste . To ask a man for a job is n't good taste . At a second and a third office , finding men even more unctuous than the first , I left without mentioning the purpose ofmy visit . Compared to their polished emptiness , the curt rebuffs of foremen seemed the height of compassion . Disheartened , I called it a day . Another to whom my list took me was the head of a large food-shipping company . From my old French doctor I learned beforehand that he was a big man in the city , prominent in public affairs and clubs , as sharp as a whip in business . I was kept waiting an hour . Then I found myself in an office with the light full in my eyes . At first I could see only a mountain of flesh blocking out the window . Later I discerned features , sensual , bald , coarse , full of ruthless energy . You could sense at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women . Lust , acquisitiveness , love of power and display were stamped all over his face . Yet here this man sat before me as solemn and intractable as a Buddha on a dais , not opening his mouth , staring at me out of one eye . Ill at ease , I stammered out an explanation . He let me tangle myself up in knots ( would to God I had some smoothness ) ; then interrupted with a question , asked it again ; and when I began to repeat my original answer , snapped , " You told me that . " He pondered for several minutes . " Come back in couple of days , and I 'll see what I can do for you , " he uttered . When I did he sent out an application blank with his office boy . The man was under no obligation to give me work or even to see me . I could have understood his being annoyed or his saying bluntly , " I have n't a thing for you , " or , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this pose of the demigod , the strong and silent superman swaying a vast domain from a flat-topped throne ? a pose I have seen struck time and again in business men ? Whom do they think to deceive besides their office boys ? I used to be disgusted with Greenwich Village artists because of that air of bonhomie and reckless living which in most of them is humbug . But back of bohemia there is at least a kind of renunciation , a fine revolt , even if only weakly carried out . Like the monk , the bohemian lives by poverty and faith ? if not by chastity and obedience . The business man 's only faith is his faith in money .. His pose is simply small-time hokum . I had one name left . This proved to be a young Jewish lawyer whom I shall call Marcus Schulman . At first he seemed odd , even grotesque . While I talked he kept fumbling through the papers on his desk . Then he would stop , open his mouth wide , and study me minutely . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to come , and Schulman was puzzled ; he could n't make me out . Little by little his distrust faded together with my confusion . A warmth sprang up between us . His eyes , alert and clear with a beautiful candor , stopped edging off and came to rest on my face . I could feel that he was interested , though I suspected his was a straw-fire interest which to-morrow would be burned out . Still , for the first time in New Orleans ? no , for the first time in the South , I bumped into a really fine mind . It flashed swiftly and without fear over personalities , ideas , books , places . Whata joy it is to run headlong into a , man 's free mind ! I felt unbound ; I laughed ; I talked in a rush of words . For months I had been alone , utterly locked in . Now it seemed as if I had come up from the bottom of a deep pool and was sucking in fresh air . Oh , I liked this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection found an echo in him : he could n't help liking me too . Two days later he got me a job on the freight docks in the harbor . The cold wind whips the damp through my clothes . I rise in the dark at five and it is dark when I come home , bristling with dust and cotton lint . Yet how good it is to work again , to know at the end of day that you have earned your bread ! Already the mists of depression begin to lift from my mind . Look , at night I even start writing again . But the sword of Damocles hangs over my head . " It 's a bad year . Shipping is dull . Naw , sir , it ai n't what it ought to be this time of the year . " Any day it may shrink till my job is gone . Then the ordeal will start over again .
