Conductor Leopold Anton Stanislaw Stokowski has a way of taking his Philadelphia audiences to account . Last week they annoyed him by coming late to a concert , clattering down the aisles , banging down seats . He stopped the music , wheeled on them : " Please , please do n't make those noises . They are very distracting . We work hard all week to give you this music , but I can not do my best without your aid . I 'll give you my best or I wo n't give you anything . It is for you to choose . " <P> The ushers mistook the pause for the end of the number , admitted more people . Conductor Stokowski sprang off his dais and off the stage . Philadelphians caught their breaths , sat still as pins till he came back , started the concert for the third time .
