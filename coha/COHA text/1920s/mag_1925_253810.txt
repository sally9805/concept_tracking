They were not Tilden and Johnston . They were not Borotra and Brugnon . They were much younger than that- slim high school lads in their teens . But to them the match was infinitely more important than any that was ever played at Forest Hills or Wimbledon . And they played ably- serving swiftly , slamming hard- there in a Manhattan armory , for the national junior indoor tennis championship . The larger of the two , Henry C. Johnson Jr. , of Newton Academy ( Waban , Mass. ) , was behind but wearing well , pulling up . The frail one , Horace G. Orser , of George Washington High School ( Manhattan ) , had fatigued himself cracking over an impregnable service for two hard sets . The third set drew out to deuce , to 6-all , to 7-all . Frail Horace bit his lip , clung to his nerve , made it 8-7 , became champion . Score : 6-3 , 6-4 , 9-7 . In the doubles , played afterwards , Henry found solace . He and Malcolm T. Hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Horace and his partner , Kenneth Appel . <P> Last week on a covered court in Paris , two other young men strove . They too were not Tilden and Johnston . They were Ren LaCoste and Jean Borotra . Ren had no trouble in covering himself with la glorie . He beat Jean , the French Davis Cup captain , 114 points to 88 ( 8-6 , 6-0 , 6-3 ) and captured the Christmas Cup . Then , said Ren : " With another visit to the United States , I may do better !
