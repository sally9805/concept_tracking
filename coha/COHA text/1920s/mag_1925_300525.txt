President Coolidge pressed a button in the White House . No secretary or stenographer entered ; no uniformed blackamoor thrust his head around a screen , but far away in Chicago a gong rang ; the lights in the huge amphitheatre of the Chicago Riding Club flashed on ; a fine brass band assisted by a $50,000 organ struck up successively the national anthems of Belgium , France , England , the U. S. , while a mighty shout arose from the crowd . National Horse Show had begun . <P> President Coolidge , in the White House , sat down to pass a pleasant evening with a dossier of papers and a pair of carpet slippers , but in the Chicago Riding Club thoroughbred horses paraded to the music of the band ; society sat throned in boxes draped with Spanish shawls , which gave the place the appearance of a bull ring ; delegations of children from the Catholic , Jewish and Protestant orphanages and from the Illinois Children 's Home clapped their hands in delight . Once the great gathering sucked in its breath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " that fevers a plaza de toros when the matador is tossed . This was when Vadabelle , ridden by Dick Messcrop of Port Chester , N. Y. , in taking the five-foot wall at the edge of the tanbark instead of the last jump on the course , went sprawling into a group of spectators , knocking them down like dolls . But no one was hurt ; Vadabelle went back to her stall . Otto W. Lehmann 's Princess Mary went jingling around with a fine gait to take the heavy harness event . Miss America of the Cavalry School bested Light o ' Love in the hurdles . Officers from all the countries whose national anthems the band had played rode against the U. S. on their sleek chargers and were soundly beaten . Eleven out of 13 of the early blue ribbons went to horses that were not owned , trained , bred or ridden by people from Chicago .
