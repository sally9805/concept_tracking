Can you locate the River Brisbane ? It flows east into the Pacific Ocean out of the highlands behind Brisbane , Australia . It often floods its flats , causing destruction in the low-lying suburbs of Brisbane . <P> What of this ? Along its sluggish surface , one J. Padden , world 's professional sculling champion , last week propelled himself and his slender shell fast enough to put six lengths between him and Alfred Felton , 1919 champion . <P> This race has never been held in the U. S. and only once in Canada . That was in 1901 , on Rat Portage River . Favorite scenes since 1880 have been the Parramatta River , New South Wales ( 18 times ) ; Thames River , England , ( 11 times ) ; Wanganui River , New Zealand , ( 4 times ) .
