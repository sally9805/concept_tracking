Great names are faces . To read " MUSSOLINI " is to receive a potent visual impression . Last week Germans read " STINNES , " and before them arose an unforgettable face ( See Cut ) . <P> The scare heads said STINNES IN JAIL . That was only literally true . In a clean Berlin cell sat only Hugo Hermann Stinnes Jr. - not his late father STINNES , the titan who turned his coal and iron into fleets of ships , miles of factories , myriads of newspaper presses-all , all HIS ( TIME , April 21 , 1924 ) . In those mighty days STINNES was the Despot of German industry and the Bogey Man of Europe . . . . <P> Last week Stinnes sat in a cell . He did not want to get out . Swindled people wanted to get in-to smash the runt ! <P> Hugo Hermann Stinnes Jr . is charged with supplying sharpsters with funds whereby a bond swindle involving several million marks was attempted . Clumsy , they falsified twice as many bonds of a certain series as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racket as clever as that . In cell sat Stinnes . He had been obliged to resign as president of 17 Stinnes companies in which U. S. investors have a stake of $25,000,000.
