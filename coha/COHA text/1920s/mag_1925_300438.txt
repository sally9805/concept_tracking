Last week portentous rumblings issued again from Fascist throats . II Benito , cheered by thousands at Vercelli , an active industrial centre , erupted into interrogatives as follows : <P> " What does the Opposition amount to ? What do we care whether they continue their boycott* or return to Parliament ? What do we care for their impotent resolutions , their slanderous falsehoods , their hates ? Do they really think they can halt our impetuous advance with their fatuous paper barricades ? They will never succeed ! " <P> Meanwhile Deputy Farinacci , Secretary General of the Fascist party , speaking at Bari , scattered affirmatives from which the direction of his party 's " impetuous advance " might be charted . <P> Said he , with pre-honeyed menace : " Our regime , haying passed laws for its consolidation and defense , will now begin work on laws of reconstruction . . . . This phase will be perfectly peaceful if we are not disturbed , but will be pushed through by force if anyone dares to stand in our way . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the last session of Parliament , as a boycott-protest against a series of laws passed to give the Fascist Government practically unbridled power ( see TIME , Jan. 19 ) .
