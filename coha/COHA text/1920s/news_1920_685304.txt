txt The fiftieth anniversary of the Metropolitan Museum is celebrated today by a reception , and a commemorative exhibition will be open tomorrow . to the public . The occasion naturally will be marked by a certain fervor of attention to the past . Aside from the reminiscent mood appropriate to anniversaries , we have not yet quite shaken offthe feeling that a museum is in the nature of a. that the objects it contains , however , beautiful and filled with the intensified vitality of the artist who expresses the whole energy of life in his work , are nevertheless dead objects , over and done with except as idols to be worshipped idly . The first gift made to the Metropolitan Museum was a sarcophagus . But the chief glory of the Metropolitan Museum is that this cramped and ungenerous attitude of mind has been alien to it from the beginning . It , has not grown old but young in the wide span of its years , because it has encouraged the outlook toward the future with which its founders started , and has developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art assembled by it . play their part of direct service to this country avd time . When the Museum was five years old its annual report noted cheerfully that already it had had its effect for good , that several schools had introduced the history and principles of the fine arts into their courses of education , that teachers came with their pupils to find illustrations of the subjects they were studying ; a tear later it Was recorded that artisans visited the Museum in numbers to gain instruction in their respective arts , and that outside the galleries , a higher standard of taste was beginning to be observed in household decoration and an eagerness on the part of the people of the city to gather works of art about them Was apparent , in part , no doubt , due to the influence of the new Museum . In 1880 , when the Museum , after ten years of wandering from house to house , found a permanent home , Mr. CHOATE congratulated the Legislature upon its forethought in providing for the erection of theL Central Park building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said in : the inaugural address , " and has become their best resource " and most efficient educator , if it be " within the real , objects of govern " ment to ' bromote the general wel " fare , , to make education practical , to " foster commerce , to instruct and en- , " courage the trades , and to enable " the industries of our people to keep " pace with , instead of falling hope " lessly behind , those of other States " and nations , then no expenditure " could be mere wise , more profitable , " more truly republican . " The words should echo today with a very pleasant music in- the ears of those who have devoted ' their time and energies , to justifying them . It was not- until 1907 that an adequately : organized effort was made to extend ' ' ihe vital and practical influences of art to the " working millions " " toward whose welfare and efficiency Mr. ' CHOATE was looking . At that time ** of ? MUseurn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle began to make art omnipresent among us as it was in Greece and Egypt and Italy when they were the countries representing the power of civilization in , the world . The devices employed by the department for overcoming mental lassitude , for stimulating that desire for doing which is the life of a people , and the desire for doing well which is the honor of a people ; for encouraging study of originals and examination of technical methods as well as of results ; for bringing manufacturers and designers together on one plane of interest in the quality of the thing to be produced ; for interesting teachers in what they were teaching and pupils in what they were learning , ? are too many to be ' enumerated . But it is this strong creative spirit in the Museum , its determination to share in al ) , the interests of the metropolitan ' community in which it is placed , that il justifies our pride in it . Its possessionsare now great and include extraordinary treasures , but the use that it makes of its treasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
