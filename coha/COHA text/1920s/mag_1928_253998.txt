A Girl in Every Port . <P> " Said rollicking Bill , the sailor . " <P> Elizabethan Ballad . <P> There are two rollicking sailors in this fractious and excellent comedy . One is Spike Madden , an amorous captain ; the other is Salami , a tough , common , swab , whose philanderings around the world are vastly annoying to the first . In every port to which Spike Madden ventures , searching love and its accompanying delights , he finds that Salami has already appropriated the most lovely ladies . Enraged , he longs to meet his rival and give him a beating . He does not , however , discover the identity of Salami until this wayward character , traveling incognito , has worsted him in a street fight for which both are put in jail . <P> As might be expected the rivals become fast friends and are to be seen together scouting the bright seas for frolic and fistfighting . In Marseilles they meet Marie , who loves the swab and is beloved of Madden . She , a most charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end , Spike Madden and Salami , both very drunk , fare forth from Marseilles in search of further fun beyond the seas . <P> A Girl in Every Port is really What Price Glory ? translated from arid and terrestrial irony to marine gaiety of the most salty and miscellaneous nature . Nobody could be more charming than Louise Brooks , that clinging and tender little barnacle from the docks of Marseilles . Director Howard Hawks and his entire cast , especially Robert Armstrong , deserve bouquets and kudos . <P> The Crowd . Director King Vidor and Scenarist John V. A. Weaver tell here honestly , finely , the story of an American Everyman , the man in the street , born to run with the pack . They put Eleanor Boardman , wife of Director Vidor , into the role of the wife , where she played with disconcerting beauty . They put James Murray , virile boy , into the part of John Sims , average child , average man . They seated him at a desk , one of a thousand clerks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with spring , to Coney Island with his girl , had him kiss her in the tunnel of love and bump her in the crazy house , until she leaned a tired head on his shoulder . Then they sent both to Niagara Falls . <P> John Sims &; Wife come back to a closet flat , under the noise of the elevated , where the bathroom door swings open annoyingly , and the Murphy bed clasps catch on blankets . John becomes twice a father and gets an eight dollar raise . John and Mary worry and work ; then in a mobbed street a truck crushes the baby , and John , frenzied , tries to stop the city because his child is sick . The acid of the tragedy bites his brain . He loses his job , his work fibre loosens , he is out of step with the crowd . When Mary threatens to leave him , he gets a sandwichman job ; the work fibre tightens , and John Sims . Everyman , is once more running with the pack , happy .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
