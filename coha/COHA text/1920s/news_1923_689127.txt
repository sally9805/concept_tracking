txt A marked improvement in Brazilian exchange since the first week in June  --  although it has not been fully sustained  --  was the first tangible proof of President Beynardes ' efforts to nurse the public valescence . One cent is not much the mitre 's , but 11 cents instead of terment of 10 per cent . This was due primarily to the reappearance of coffee bills with the new crop , which commences statistically on July 1 , but which in reality accounts for entries at Brazilian ports all through June . Another presage of recovery is the news that a surplus of revenue over expenditure has been obtained by the government for the firSt quarter of this year , It is equivalent to only about $510,000 , Nit it is the first surplus in 22 years , and its moral effect may be prodigious . Improvement in exchange means enhanced profits for importers who have goods to deliver , and slightly better prospects of obtaining new orders . , Federal government , states and municipalities , with foreign debt service to meet will breathe more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be easy to keep it going . Brazilian ' produce is fetching fair prices ; the rubber , extraction industry is reviving ; treasury emissions of paper money have stopped ; the balance of trade for first quarter of ' 1923 is satisfactory . But it is extremely doubtful whether the improvement will ' be sustained this year at a rate muck exceeding the highest registered in June . The coffee interests are powerful in Brazil , and high exchange is their pet aversion . Government is pledged to help the planters , and has exacted payment in advance for doing so . Every fraction of a rise in milreis value makes this more costly . As the current crop is a bumper , much coffee would have to be taken off the market in order to sustain prices . It is true that this coffee could be pledged for a loan , but more foreign debt service is exactly what the government wishes most to avoid . So far , coffee trade conditions in Brazil are rose-colored . Prices are adequa'e and world 's supply less than usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small . But stores will soon be gorged to overflowing . Dollar prices must inevitably decline . If , yield in milreis is reasonably good planters do not complain . If it is not , their outcry is loud and , persistent .
