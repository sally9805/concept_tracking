Handsome , stocky , dark , and dapper , Gene Sarazen , walked round a golf course at Nassau with dour Johnny Farrell , voted the best dressed U. S. golfer . At the ninth hole Sarazen was a stroke behind . At the seventeenth he was all even . He sank his approach shot on the eighteenth for a birdie 2 . Farrell 's 15-foot putt hit the back of the cup and bounced out . Sarazen , who goes to Nassau yearly for a sunburn , had won the open championship of the Bahama Islands . In St. Augustine , Fla. , Glenna Collett , favorite daughter of Providence , R. I. , and of Robert Collett , onetime six-day bicycle rider , outdrove Virginia Van Wie on nearly every tee to win the women 's Florida East Coast championship .
