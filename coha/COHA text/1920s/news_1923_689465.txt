txt Magistrate Joseph E. Corrigan brought his defense of the criminal libel action started by Police Commissioner Enright to a sudden and dramatic close yesterday when , as the final witness in the Proceedings before Judge Thomas C. T. Crain , he declared that when he gave out a telegram containing a reference to " Enright and his graft collectors " he believed that Commissioner Enright was a. grafter . The Magistrate 's appraisal of the Police Department head was not volunteered . It was brought out as the result of a direct question by Assistant District Attorney Pecora on cross-examination . Magistrate Corrigan denied that in giving out the telegram he sought to give expression to his private thoughts . On the contrary , he asserted that he felt that the publication of the telegram was unjust and unfair to Mr. Enright , and added that he had believed it understood that the offending words were to be struck out of the message before publication . Nevertheless . Magistrate Corrigan de- . Oared , he believed that he had submitted some " pretty good proof " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Peeore , to specify theRroOrr ize replied : ?  --  a r- think ? that when you get to Room 20d , ** you are getting pretty close to home . " o ? ' " Do you think that is fair proof that Enright took graft ? " asked Mr. Pecora . " I think that it is a fair inference , " said Magistrate Corrigan . " Room 205 " Brought Up . Room 205 , according to the testimony of the hearing , was the private office of Commissioner Enright at the time of the so-called Petrucci case , on May 28. 1021 . It was from there that Detective William Morrison testified that he received a telephone message warning him to " lay off " after he had stopped a truckload of liquor , which the driver said belonged to three high police officials . Magistrate Corrigan , under direct examination by John D. Lindsay , his counsel , swore that while he believed that Widespread corruption among the police was the inevitable consequence of the Mullan-Gage State Prohibition law , he had no legal proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had assiduously avoided personalities . The reference to Commissioner Enright in the telegram , Magistrate Corrigan also said , had not struck him at the time he gave it out . In fact , he asserted , his intention was centred on the suggestion made by Assemblyman Cuvilher , the sender of the telegram for a ' legislative investigation of the police situation . When he did notice the allusion to Commissioner Enright , he said , he called up the representative of one newspaper and asked that the phrase be struck out and that the other newspapers be notified . " I told him I would not take any responsibility for it , " he said . Counsel May Sum Up Today . With the testimony of Magistrate Corrigan both the defense and the prosecution rested . Judge Crain adjourned the proceedings to 10:30 this morning , when the counsel may sum up , if Judge Crain so allows . It is possible that briefs will be submitted . While there is nothing to prevent a decision by Judge Crain today as to whether Magistrate Corrigan and Assemblyman Cuvillier shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he will defer such a decision for several days at least . Assemblyman Cuvillier , who has been Present at only a few of the sessions , has not put in any defense . He has argued that the telegram was the privy ileged act of a member of the Legislature . Judge Crain ordered that Mr. Cuvillier be instructed to appear this morning . Before Magistrate Corrigan took the stand the examination of Commissioner Enright , begun on Tuesday , was completed . The Commissioner was questioned further by Mr. Lindsey concerning his official acts with regard to the Petrucci case and other cases of alleged police misdeeds related to Mullan-Gage enforcement . Mr. Pecora 's cross-examination involved less than a dozen questions . As on Tuesday , the demeanor of the Police Commissioner was cool and he continued unruffled under the examination to which he was subjected . He characterized as " grand-stand plays " dismissals of policemen on charges when it seemed certain that the courts would reinstate them , and declared that no such practices were indulged in under his administration . ? The Commissioner had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry . A. Gordon . appeared with a bundle of documents , which he threw upon the counsel table . It developed that the documents were statements from 425 banks , taking in all those in the city , certifying that Commissioner Enright had no accounts with them . The statements of the five Registers in the city that he owned no real estate accompanied them . The certifications were obtained at the suggestion of Judge Crain . " There are 9,000 banks and trust companies in the United States , " said Mr. Lindsay.co " There are hundreds of banks in the unties adjoining New York State . i maintain that this evidence is incompetent , immaterial and irrelevant . " It was finally received in evidence after Mr. Lindsay had agreed to stipulate that if the signers of the certificates had appeared as witnesses they would have testified in substance as their certificates indicated . The declaration of Magistrate Corrigan that he believed Commissioner Enright was a grafter came suddenly while Mr. Pecora was cross-questioning him on his previous assertion that as a City Magistrate he had observed conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned up . " " I ? was referring to 6- situation-1n which I believed that the police were not only not acting honestly in the enforcement of the Mullan-Gage law , " said Magistrate Corrigan , " but I felt that perjury was being committed in cases being heard before me ? I felt that justice was a mockery . " Mr. Pecora asked him whether he had any proof of police misdeeds . " No , I think not , " was the reply , " if you mean legal proof. , If I had had legal proof I would have taken some action . " Mr. Pecora , in view of Magistrate Corrigan 's admission that much of the material presented in the defense of the libel action was not in his possession at the time the telegram was published , asked that all of such testimony be struck out . Judge Crain said that he would allow it to stand . Believes Enright a Grafter . Then came this testimony : Q. ?

He said that he was slightly acquainted with Commissioner Enright and their relations had been pleasant . He said that as a Magistrate he had heard about 10,000 cages a. year . He said that he was not in favor of prohibition and that he was partieulraly opposed to the passage of the MullanGage law . " When the Mullan-Gage law was under consideration I thought it would open a wide field . of graft , and my experience since its passage has confirmed that opinion . My opinion was that fully 50 per cent . of the cases were decided in the corridors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can either make a case or not by his testimony . " Magistrate Corrigan testified that in saying as he did in Essex Market Court that half of the police in New York were bootleggers " he " expressed himself rather forcefully , " edt explained that he was " very much annoyed " at the ' character of testimony before him . It was this statement that led to an investigation by Commissioner Hirshfield. which Magistrate Corrigan characterized as a " whitewashing " investigation . Says Hirshfield Abused Him . " Commissioner Hirshfield spent most of his time abusing me , " he said . " I had a pretty tough deal down there . " On Mr. Pecora 's objection the last declaration was struck Out . This testimony followed : Q. ? In view of the results of the Hirshfield investigation , what did you do ? A. ?

Judge Craft ) held that the city had a legal right to test the validity of the subpoena ; " When . a step is taken with the purpose of impeding an investigation it should be inquired into , " said Judge Crain . " In this case , however , the Commissioner , as an official , felt that it was his duty to resist the subpoena . I am confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisted it . " Judge Crain declined to admit as evidence a general order of the Police Department dated July 12 . It contained letters exchanged between the Commissioner and Mayor Hylan in which reference was made to the Crain Inquiry . " Your Honor knows , " said Mr. Lindsay , " that police witnesses have shown an unwillingness to testify on their appearance here . This is an act on the part of the complainant to guide the whole force  --  those who had been witnesses and those who may have been witnesses . " Mr. Lindsay turned to the retirement of Captain Patrick Randles after he had testified at the Crain inquiry . Commissioner Enright admitted that an investigation of Captain Randles had been ordered . " The point was , " he said , " that the Chief Inspector was under suspension and out of the department , The Chief Inspector says that Captain Randles did not put him in possession of all the facts . I ordered the Second Deputy Commissioner to make an investigation to find out the truth .

" Commissioner Enright knows nothing about these cases ; I do . So , while I am representing him here , he is representing me . " Commissioner Leach declared that " some people " seem to think that policemen should be dropped from the force " on their say-so . " He explained that it takes five years to make a man into a fully ' efficient policeman . " You have got to give them that length of time to know if they are making good or not , " he said . Under the Enright regime , he declared , great care is taken in dismissing policeman . Evidence of this was contained in the fact that while 150 policemen have been dismissed , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The oft-hurled allegation that high officials of the police are protecting vice and serious crime has been thoroughly , investigated by me and I can find no evidence of any kind that any high official is interested in this regard .
