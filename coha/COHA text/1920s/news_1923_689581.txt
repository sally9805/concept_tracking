txt Copper sales , foreign and domestic , by American agencies so far this month are estimated at 200,000,000 to 225,000,000 pounds , or more than a month 's mine production at present rate sold during the first two weeks of November . ' This is as active a half month as any this year and accounts for the recovery of almost 1 cent a pound during the last two weeks . Record sales for the industry were in November , 1919 , when 481,000,000 pounds were sold for foreign and . domestic account . While it is hardly to be expected that sales for the second half of the month will approach first-half business in magnitude , several agencies are not especially anxious for further business at present prices . Magnitude of November business seems to assure strong copper market for the remainder of the year , as with advance in copper , ultimate consumers have begun to place good orders with wire drawers and brass works , indicating good winter business .               @ @ @ @ @ @
