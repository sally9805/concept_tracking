FINGERS poke through cold holes in the wool mittens ; the old coat with two buttons gone flaps and blows about the knees : dirt and old papers spiral upward on the chill gusts of a raw winter day . Close your eyes , duck your head , and hurry on . Under one arm is clutched the paper bag filled with lunch and the blue-checked apron ; under the other , the . old brown leather bag . In the old brown leather bag is an old black purse . In the old black purse are fifty-five cents , a key , and a safety pin . In the old brown bag are also two sticks of chewing gum , a frayed handkerchief , and the crumpled list of possible jobs . That list was copied from the Sunday World ? " Female Help Wanted , Miscellaneous . " On Sunday the future looked bright . Now , when four attempts to land jobs had ended in failure , the future did not look bright at all . Because , you understand , we were assuming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-five cents and a key and a safety pin was all that stood between us and ? well , a number of dismal things . And this was fifty-five cents and a key and a safety pin more than some people had that Monday morning in New York . You must know that in days of unemployment it is something of a catastrophe if you do not land the first job for which you apply on Monday morning . For by the time you reach the second place on the list , no matter how fast you may go , it is apt to have been filled from the group which was waiting there from 7.30 on , as you had waited at your first hope . The third chanceis slimmer still by far , and if you keep on until 10 or 11 it is practically wasted time .. And if you do not land a job Monday , that whole week is as good as lost . Of course , there is always a chance ? the smallest sort of chance ? that something can be found later on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 7.30-to-8.30 wait Monday morning . Often it is 9 before the firm sees fit to announce that it needs no more help , and there you are with fifty-five cents and a key and a safety pin ? or less ? to do till Monday next . It was strange what a. cruel comfort one felt at the sight of the countless others hurrying about hopelessly , hopefully , that raw Monday morning . On every block where a firm had advertised for help were girls scanning their already worn lists , making sure of the address , hastening on . Nor were they deterred by the procession marching away ? even if some one called no use goin ' up there ? they do n't want no more . " Perhaps , after all , thought each girl to herself , the boss would want her . The boss did not . First , early in the morning and full of anticipation , I made for the bindery on West Eighteenth Street , which had seemed the likeliest of the various possibilities . No need to get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It must be where the crowd stood on the sidewalk ahead , some thirty girls and as many men and boys . Everyone was pretty cheerful ? it was twenty minutes to eight and most of us were young . Rather too many wanted the same job , but there were no worries to speak of . Others might be unlucky ? not we . So our little group talked . Bright girls they were , full of giggles and " gee 's ! ' Finally the prettiest and the brightest of the lot peered in through the street doors . " Say , w'at d'ye know ? I see a bunch inside ! Come on ! " In we shoved our way , and there in the dismal basement-like first floor waited as many girls and men as on the sidewalk . Good night ! A fat show those dead ones outside stand ! " And we passed the time of day a bit longer . The pretty and smart one was not for such tactics long . " W'at d'ye say we go up to where the firm is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? " You said it ! " And we tore up the iron stairs . On the second flight we passed a janitor . " Where 's the bindery ? " " Eighth floor . " " My Gawd ! " And up eight flights we puffed in single file , conversation impossible for lack of wind . The bright one opened the door and our group of nine surged in . There stood as many girls and men as down on the first floor and out on the sidewalk . " My Gawd ! " There was nothing else to say . We edged our way through till we stood by the time clock . The bright one was right that was the strategic point . For at 8.30 a forewoman appeared at that very spot , and in a pleasant tone of voice announced , " We do n't need any more help , male or female , this morning ! " Two frightened looking girls just in front of me screwed up their courage and said , pleadingly , " But you told us Saturday we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , all right . Then you two go to the coatroom . " Everyone looked a bit dazed . At least one hundred girls and more than that many men had hopes of finding a job at that bindery ? and all they took were two girls from Saturday . We uttered a few of our thoughts and dashed for the iron stairs , down which we rushed pell-mell , calling all the way to the steady procession filing up , " No use ; save your breath . " Some kept on , nevertheless . From the bindery I rushed to a factory making muslin underwear . By the time I got there ? only six blocks uptown ? the boss looked incredulous that I should even be applying at such an advanced hour , although it was not yet 9 . No , he needed no more . From there to the address of an " ad. " for " light factory work , " whatever it Might turn out to be . A steady stream of girls coming and going . Upstairs a young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column of figures , called out , " No more help wanted ! " A rush to a wholesale millinery shop just off Fifth Avenue ? the only millinery establishment advertising for " learners . " The elevator was packed going up , the hallway was packed where we got out . The girls already there told us newcomers that we must write our names on certain cards . Also , we roust stale our last position , what sort of millinery jobs we expected to get , and what salary . The girl ahead of me wrote $28 . I wrote $14 . She must have been experienced in some branch of the trade . All the rest of us at our crowded end of the entry : hall were " learners . " The " ad. " here had read " apply after 9.30 , " It was not yet 9.30 . A few moments after I got there , my card just filled out , the boss called from a little window : " No more learners . All I want is one experienced copyist . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone was indignant . Several girls spoke up : " What made you advertise learners if you do n't want none ? " ? " I did want some , but I got all I want . " We filled the elevator and went down . As a last try I tore for the Subway and Park Place , down by the Woolworth Building . By the time I reached that bindery there were only two girls ahead of me . A man interviewed the younger . She had had a good hit of bindery experience . The man was noncommittal . The other , a very refined middle-aged woman had had years of experience . She had no sooner spoken of it than the man squinted his eyes at her and said : " You belong to the union , then , do n't you ? " ? " Yes , " the woman admitted with no hesitation , " I do , but that makes no difference ; I 'm perfectly willing to work with nonunion girls . I 'm a good worker and I do n't see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , " What bindery experience have you had ? " I had to admit I had had no bindery experience , but I made it clear I was a very experienced person in many other fields , and willing and quick to learn . " Nothing doing for you . " But he had advertised for " learners . " " Yes , but why should I use learners when I turned away over seventy experienced girls this morning , ready to do any work for any old price ? " I was hoping to hear what else he might say to the union member , but the man left me no excuse for standing around . I ate my lunch at home . When the next Sunday morning came , the future again looked bright . I redpenciled eleven " ads. " ? jobs in three different dress factories , sewing buttons on shoes ( you see I have to pick only such positions as require no previous experience ? it is only among unskilled workers that I belong as yet ) , girls to pack tea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco , in sample cards , girls to pack hair nets , " learners " on fancy feathers , and " learners " to operate book-sewing machines . The rest of the newspaper chronicled much trouble in the garment trades . I decided to try the likeliest dress factory first . I was hopeful , but not enough so to Lake my lunch and apron . Reaching the first dress factory before eight o'clock , I found about nine girlsahead of me . We waited downstairs by the elevator , as the boss had not yet arrived . The " ad . " I was answering read , " Wanted ? Bright girls to make themselves useful around dress factory . " Upstairs in the hall we assembled to wait upon the pleasure of the boss . The woodwork was white , the floor pale blue ? it was all very impressive . Finally , second try , the boss fixed his eye on me . " Come in here . " A white door closed behind us , and we stood in a little room which looked as if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old scraps and odds and ends , unpainted . " What experience you have had ? " He was a nice-looking , fairly-young Jew who spoke with a , good deal of German accent . " None in a dress factory , but . . . " and I regaled him with the vast amount of experience in other lines that was mine , adding that I 'd done a good deal of " private dressmaking " off and on , . and also assuring him almost tremblingly ? I did so want to land a job ? that I was the most willing of workers . " What you expect to get ? " " What will you pay me ? " " No , I 'm asking you . What you expect to get ? " " Fourteen dollars . " " All right . Go on in . " If the room where the boss had received me could have been the work of a twelve-year-old , the rest of the factory must have been designed and executed by a boy of eight . There was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boards of various woods and sizes had been used and nothing had ever been painted . Such doors as existed had odd ways of opening and closing . The whole place looked as if it had cost about $7.29 to throw together . But , all ! the white and pale blue of the showrooms ! The dress-factory job was like another world compared with the candy , brass , and the laundry jobs of which I have previously written . In each of those places I had worked on one floor of a big plant doing one subdivided piece of labor among equally low-paid workers busy at the same sort of job as myself . Of what went on in the processes before and after the work we did , I knew or saw nothing . We packed finished chocolates ; we punched slots in already made lamp cones ; we ironed alreadywashed , starched , and dampened clothes . Such work as we did Look no particular skill , though a certain improvement in speed and quality of work came with practice . One 's eyes could wander now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation with one 's neighbors was always possible . Behold the dress factory , a little complete world of its own on one small floor where every process of manufacture , and all of it skilled work , could be viewed from any spot . Not quite every process ? the designer had a room of her own up front nearer to that place where the woodwork was white . " Ready-made clothing ! " It sounds so simple . Mrs. Fine Lady saunters into a shop , puts up her lorgnette and lisps , " I 'd like to see something in a satin afternoon dress . " A plump blonde in tight-fitting black with a marcel wave trips over to mirrored doors , slides one back , takes a dress off its hanger ? and there you are ! " So much simpler than bothering with a dressmaker . " But what had brought that dress to the place where the blonde could sell it ? " Ready-made " indeed ! There had to be a start somewhere before there was any " made " to it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French designer first got a notion into her head ? she who waved her arms and gesticulated and flew into French-English rages just the way they do on the stage . " Mon Dieu ! Mon Dieu ! " ? gray-haired Madame would gasp at our staid and portly Mr. Rogers . Ada could say " My Gawd ! " through her Russian nose to him and it had nothing like the same wilting effect . Ready-made ? yes , ready-made . But first Madame got her notion , and then she and her helpers concocted the dress itself . A finished article , it hung inside the wire inelosure where the nice young cutter kept himself and his long , high table . The cutter took a look at the finished garment hanging on the side of his cage , measured a bit with his yard stick , and then proceeded to cut the pattern out of paper . Whereupon he laid flat yards and yards of silks and satins on his table and with an electric cutter sliced out his-parts . All those pieces had to be sorted according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanted ? bright and useful girl right here . ) Next came the sewing-machine operators ( electric power ) ? a long narrow table , nine machines at a side , but not more than fourteen operators were employed ? thirteen girls and one lone young man . They said that on former piece rates this man used to make from $90 to $100 a week . The operators were all well paid , especially if compared with candy , brass , and laundry standards , but they were a skilled lot . A very fine-looking lot , too ? some of the nicest-looking girls I 've seen in New York . Everyone had a certain style and assurance . It was good for the eyes to look on them after the laundry thirteen-dollar-a-week type . When the first operators had done their part the dresses were handed over to the drapers . There were two drapers , who were getting about $50 a week before the hard times . No oite appeared to know what anybody 's wages really were at present . There seemed some reticence in discussing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl as I ever saw anywhere ; bobbed hair , deep-set eyes , a Russian Jewess with features which made her look more like an Italian . She spoke English with hardly any accent . She dressed very quietly and in excellent taste . All day long the two draped dresses on forms , always pinning and pinning . The dram pers turned the dresses over to certain operators , who finished all the machine sewing . The next work fell to the finishers . In that same end of the factory sat the four finishers , getting " about NO a week , " but again no one seemed sure . Two were Italians who could speak little English . One was Gertie , four weeks married ? " to a Socialist . " Gestic was another of the well-dressed ones . If you could know these dress-factory girls you would realize how , unless gifted with the approach of a newspaper reporter ? and I lack that approach ? it was next to impossible to ask a girl herself what she was earning . No more than you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls themselves who had been working long together in the same shop did not seem to know what one another 's wages were . It was a new state of affairs in my factory experience . The finishers , after sewing on all hooks and eyes and fasteners and doing all Lhe remaining hand work on the dresses , turned them over to the two pressers ? sedate , assured Italians , who ironed all day long and looked prosperous and were very polite . They brought the dresses hack to Jean and her helper ? two girls who put the last finishing touches on a garment before it went into the showroom ? snipping here and there , rough edges all smoothed off . It was to Jean the boss called my second morning , very loud so all could hear , " If you find anything wrong mit a dress do n't look at it , do n't bodder ? Did it ? jus ' - Crow it in dere faces and make ' em do it over again ! It 's not like the old days no more ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? there was your dress , " ready-made . . . " This used to be the entire factory personnel , if we add the two office girls , the model , who was wont to run around our part of the world now and then in a superior fashion , clad in a scant pale pink-satin petticoat which came just below her knees and an old gray-and green sweater ; plus various male personages , full of business and dressed in their best . Goodness knows what all they did do to keep the wheels of industry running ? perhaps they were salesmen . They had the general appearance of earning at least ten to twenty thousand dollars a year . It may possibly have risen as high as two thousand . And Peters ? who was small , though grown , and black , and who cleaned up with a fearful dust and " snitched " lead pencils if you left them around . At present , in addition , were the sixteen crochet headers , because crochet beading is stylish in certain quarters ? their " department " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headers could begin work the goods had to he stamped , and before they could be stamped Mr. Rogers had to concoct a design . He worked in the cage at a raised end of the cutting table . He first pricked the pattern through paper with a machine at a small table outside by the headers . That table was always piled high with a Mess of everything from spools to dresses , which Mr. Rogers patiently removed each time to some spot where some one else found them on top of something she wanted , and less patiently removed them to some other spot , where still less patiently they were found in the way and dumped some place else . And Ada would call out still later : " Mr. Rogers , did you see a pile of dresses on this table when you went to work ? " Whereat in abject politeness and dismay Mr. Rogers would dash out of his cage and explain in very broken English that there had been some things on the table but " vairee carefully " he had placed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pile had disappeared . If a dress had to be beaded , Mr. Rogers took the goods after the cutter finished his job , and he and his helpers stamped the patterns on sleeves , front and back and skirt , by rubbing chalk over the paper . Upon the scene at this psychological moment enters the bright girl to make herself useful . ( In fact , she entered even earlier , by helping the cutter tie the bundles according to size and color . ) The bright girl " framed up " the goods for the benders to work on . To " frame up " you take boards the proper length with broad tape tacked along one edge . First you pin the goods lengthwise , pins close together . Then you find side boards the desired length and pin the goods along the sides . Then with four iron clamps you fasten the corners together , making the goods as tight as a drum . There 's a real knack to it , especially when it conies to queerly shaped pieces ? odd backs or fronts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six or eight feet long and three broad . But I can frame ! Ada said so . The space I had in which to make myself useful was literally about 3x4 feet , just in front of the shelves where the thread and beads were kept . That is , I had it if no one wanted to get anything in the line of thread or beads , which they always did want to get . Whereupon I moved out ? which meant my work might he knocked on the floor , or if it was bigger I had to move the work out with me . Or I crawled under it and got the thread or beads myself . If it were a skirt I was framing up I earned the curses , though friendly ones , of the assemblage . No one could pass in any direction . The headers were shut in their quarters till I got through or they crawled under . Or I poked people in the back with the frames while I was clamping them . I fought over every large frame I managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space I had to work in . Until in compassion they finally moved me around the corner into the dressmaking quarters , which tried Joe 's soul . Joe was the Italian foreman of that end of things . Ile was nice . But he saw no reason why I should be moved up into his already crowded space . Indeed , I was only a little better off . The fact of the matter was that the more useful I became the more in everybody 's way I got . indeed , it can be taken as a tribute to human nature that everyone in that factory was not a crabbed , nervous wreck from having to work on top of everyone else . It was almost like attempting dressmaking in the Subway . The boss at times gazed upon my own frantic efforts and declared , " Every time I look ad you the tears come in my eyes . " And I told him , " Every time I think about myself the tears come in mine . " About every other day he appeared with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assurance that his every effort spelled industrial progress and especial help to me . " All I think on is your comfort , yes ? " " Do n't get gray over it ! " So then I framed up . Nor was it merely that I worked under difficulties as to space . The boss 's idea of scientific management seemed to be to employ as few bright and useful girls as possible . He started with three . He ended with just one . From dawn to dewy eve I tore . It was " Connie , come here ! " ( Ada , the headwork forewoman ) " Connie , come here ! " ( the cutter ) " Connie , thread , thread , yes ? There 's a good girl ! " ( the headers ) " Connie , changeable beads , yes ? That 's the girl ! " " Connie , unframe these two skirts quick as you can ! " " Connie , never mind finishing those skirts ; I got to get this ' special ' framed up right away ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirts ? " " Connie , tissue paper , yes ? Thanks awfully . " " Connie , did you see that tag I laid here ? Look for it , will you ? " But the choice and rare moment of my bright and useful career was when the boss himself called , " Oh , hiss Connie , come mal here , yes ? " And when I got mel there he said , " I want you should take my shoes to the cobMars so fort , yes ? . . . And be sure you get a check . . . and go quick , yes . " Whereupon he removed his shoes and shuffled about in a pair of galoshes . I put on the green tam . I put on the old brown coat with now three buttons gone and the old fur collar , over my blue-checked apron , and with the boss 's shoes under my arm out I fared , wishing to goodness I would run into some one I knew to chuckle with me . Half an hour later the boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should bring my shoes back , yes ? " I went . The cobbler said it i ? ould be another five minutes . Five minutes to do what I would with in New York ! It was a wonderful sensation . Next to the cobbler 's a new building was going up . I have always envied those who had time to hang over a railing and watch a new building going up . At last ? my own self , my green tam , my brown coat over the blue-checked apron , chewing a stick of gum , hung over the railing for five whole minutes and watched the men on the steel skeleton . All this Lime my salary was going on just the same . I was hoping the boss would tip me ? say , a dime ? for running his errands . Otherwise I might never get a tip from anyone . He did n't . He thanked me , and after that he called me " dearie . " The first day in any new job seems strange , and I wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f felt that way for several days . Hitherto 1 had always worked with girls all round me , and it was no time before we were chatting back and forth . In the dress factory I worked by myself at chores no one else did . Also , the other girls had the sort of jobs which took concentration and attention ? there was comparatively little talk . Also , the sewing machines inside and the riveting on that steel building outside made too much noise for easy conversation . At lunch time most of the girls went out to eat at various restaurants near by . They looked so grand when they got vol .. exult ? No. 857. - 83their coats and hats on that I could not imagine them letting me tag along in my old green tam and coat with buttons missing . My wardrobe had all fitted in appropriately to candy and brass and the laundry . But not to dressmaking . So I ate my lunch out of a paper bag in the factory with such girls as stayed behind . They were mostly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the sort who would not talk had they been given a bonus and share in the profits for it . They read the Daily News , a group of some five to one paper , and ate . By Thursday of the first week I was desperate . How was 1 ever to " get next " to the dress-factory girls ? During the lunch hour Friday I gulped down my food and tore for Gimbel 's , where I bought five new buttons . Saturday I sewed them on my coat , and Monday and all the next week I ate lunch with Ada and Eva and Jean and Kate at a Yiddish restaurant , where the food had strange names and stranger tastes . But at least there was conversation . Ada I loved ? our forewoman in the bead work ? young , good-looking , intelligent . She rather took me under her wing , in gratitude for which I showed almost immediate improvement in those lines along which she labored to improve me . My grammar , for instance . When I said " it ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connie , ai n't ! " Whereat I gulped and said " is n't , " and Ada smiled approval . Within one week I had picked up wonderfully . At the end of that week Ada and I were quite chummy . She asked me one day if I was married . No . Was she ? " You do n't think I 'd be working like this if I was , do you ? " When I asked her what she would be doing if she did n't have to work , she answered , " Oh , lots of things . " Nor could I pin her to details . She told me she 'd get married to-morrow , only her " sweetheart " was a poor man . But she was crazy about him . Oh , she was . The very next day she flew over to where I was framing up . " I 've had a fight with my sweetheart ! " It was always difficult carrying on a conversation with Ada . She was continually being called for from every corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had for talk I was called for . And such jumpiness is particularly detrimental to sharing affairs of the heart . I only know fragments of Ada 's romance . The fight lasted all of four days . Then he appeared one evening , and next morning she beamingly informed me that " her sweetheart had made up . Oh , but he 's some lover , I tell you . " Ada was born in Russia , but came to this country very young . She spoke English without an accent . Never had she earned less than $20 a week , starling out as a bookkeeper . When crochet beading first became the rage , about Eve years ago , she went over to that and sometimes made $50 and $60 a week . Here as forewoman she made $40 ; $20 of that she gave each week to her mother for board and lodging . Often she had gone on summer vacations . For three years she had paid for a colored girl to do the housework at home . I despaired at first of having Ada so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . What was my joy then at the end of the first week to have her come up and say to me : " Do you know what I want ? I want you to come over to Brooklyn and live with me and my folks . " That same Saturday morning the boss said he wanted to see me after closing time . There seemed numerous others he wanted to see . Then I discovered , while waiting my turn with these others , that practically no one there knew her " prices . " There was a good deal of resentment about it , too . He had hired these girls , and no word about pay . The other girls waiting that morning were benders . I learned one trick of the trade which it appears is more or less universal . They had left their former jobs to come to this factory in answer to an " ad. " for crochet headers . If after one week it was found they were getting less than they had at the old place , they would go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otherwise , they planned to stay on at this factory . Each girl was called in alone , and alone bargained with the boss . Monday , just for instance , Sadie , ahead of me in the Saturday line , reported the conversation she had had with the boss : " Well , miss , what you expect to get here ? " " What I 'm worth . " " Yes , yes ? you 're worth one hundred dollars but I 'm talking just plain English . What you expect to get ? " " I tell you what I 'm worth . " " All right , you 're worth one hundred dollars , you think you 'll get thirty dollars . I 'll pay you twenty dollars . " ( Sadie had previously told me under no consideration would she remain under $25 , but she remained for $20 , ) My turn . I thought there was no question about my " price . " It was 814 . But , perhaps , seeing how I had run my legs almost off , and pinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to raise inc voluntarily . " What wages you expect to get here ? " Oh , well , since lie thus opened the question we would begin all new . I had worked so much harder than I bad anticipated . " Sixteen dollars a week . " " Ho ? sixteen dollars !  - -  - and last Monday it was fourteen dollars . You 're guing up , yes ? " " But the work 's much harder ' n I thought it ' it 'd be . " " So you go from fourteen dollars to sixteen dollars , and I got you here to tell you you 'd get twelve dollars . " Oh , but I was mad ? just plain mad . " You let me work all week thinkin ' I was getting fourteen dollars ? it ai n't fair ! " " Fair ? I pay you what I can afford . Times are hard now , you know . " I could not speak for my upset feelings . To pay me $12 for the endless labor of that week when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add insult to injury he said , " Next week I want you should work later than the other girls evenings and make no date for next Saturday ( I had told him I was in a hurry to get off for lunch this Saturday ) because I shall want you should work Saturday afternoon . " Such a state of affairs is indeed worth following up . Monday morning he came around breezily ? he really was a cordial , kindly soul ? and said , " Well , dearie , how are you this morning ? " I went on pinning . " Good as anybody can be on twelve dollars a week . " " Ach , forget it , forget it . Always money , money ! Whether a person gets ten cents or three hundred dollars ? it 's not the money ' at counts " ? his hands went up in the air ? " it 's the service ) " Yet employers tell labor managers they must not sentimentalize . A hit later he came back . " I tell you what I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work Saturday afternoon , like I told you you should , and I 'll pay you for it ! " To such extremes a sense of justice can carry one ! Actually , he had expected that extra work of me gratis ! During the week I figured out that in his own heart that boss had figured out a moral equivalent for a living wage . There was nothing he would not do for me . Did he but come in my general direction , I was given a helping hand . He joked with me continually . The hammer and nails were always busy . I was not only " dearie , " I was " sweetheart . " But $14 a week ? that was another story . The second week I got closer to the girls . Or , more truthfully put , they got closer to me . At the other factories I had asked most of- the questions and answered fewer . Here I could hardly get a question in edgewise for the flood which was let loose on me . I explained in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from California to look after her children . I did some work for her evenings and Saturday afternoon and Sunday , to pay for my room and board . Not only was I asked every conceivable question about myself , but at the dress factory I bad to answer uncountable questions about the lady I lived with ; her " gentlemen friends , " her clothes , her expenses . It was like pulling teeth for me to get any information out of these girls . In such a matter as reading , for example , every girl I asked was fond of reading . What kind of books ? Good books . Yes , but the names . I got We Two out of Sarah , and Jean was reading Ibsen 's Doll 's House . It . was a swell book , a play . After hours one night she told me the story . Together with Ada 's concern over my grammar , it can be seen that I left the dress factory more intellectually advanced than when I entered it . The girls I had the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole . Only now and then they went to " a show . " Less frequently they spoke of going to the Jewish Theater . No one was particularly excited over dancing ? in fact , Sarah , who looked the blond type of the danceevery-night variety , thought dancing " disgusting . " Shows were n't her style . She liked reading . Whenever I got the chance I asked a girl what she did evenings . The answer usually was , " Oh , nothing much . " One Friday I asked a group of girls at lunch if they were n't glad the next day was Saturday and the afternoon off . Four of them were n't glad at all , because they had to go home and clean house Saturday afternoons and do other household chores . " Gee ! do n't you hate workin ' round the house ? " I wonder how much of the woman-inindustry movement is traceable to just that . The first day I was at the dress factory a very dirty but pleasant-faced little Jewish girl said to me : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just awful ? " She had made $32 , a week beading at her last place ? did n't know what she 'd get here . I had hoped to hear murmurings and discussions about the conditions of the garment trades and the unions ? not a word the whole time . Papers were full of a strike to be called the next week throughout the city affecting thousands of waist and dress makers . It might as ' ( veil have been in London . Not an echo of interest in it reached our factory . I asked Sarah if she had ever worked in a union shop . " Sure . " ? " Any different from this ? " ? " Different ? You bet it 's different . Boss would n't dare treat you the way you get treated here . " But as usual I was called for and got no chance to pin Sarah to details . A group of girls in the dressing room exploded one night : " Gee ! they sure treat you like dogs here ! No soap , no towels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 12.15 ; 1.00 to 5.15 . One Saturday Ada and the boss asked the headers to work in the afternoon . Not one stayed . Too many had heard the talcs of girls working overtime and not being paid anything extra . On Wednesday I went bark after my last week 's pay . When the cashier caught sight of me she was full of inter-. est . " I was writing you a letter this very day . The boss wants you back awful badly . He 's out just now for lunch . Ca n't you wait ? " Just then the boss stepped from the elevator . " Ach , here you are ! Now , dearie ? if it 's just a matter of a few dollars or so ? " I was leaving town . Much discussion . No , I could n't stay on . Well , if I insisted ? yes , he 'd get my pay envelope . My , oh my ! they missed me ! Why so foolish as to leave New York ? Now , as for my wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Allright , all right , he 'd get my last pay envelope . . And there was my pay envelope with just $12 again . " What about my overtime ? " Overtime ? Who said anything about overtime ? He did himself . He 'd promised me if I worked every night . that week late I 'd get paid for it . Every single night I had stayed and where was pay for it ? He shook his finger at my time card . Show him one hour of overtime on that card ! I showed him where every night the time clock registered overtime . Yes , but not once was it a full hour . And did n't I know overtime never counted unless it was at least a full hour ? No , he had never explained anything about that . I 'd worked each night until everything was done and I 'd been told I could go . Well , of course he did n't want to rob me . I really had nothing coming to me . Each night I 'd stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and sce what they could pay me . They figured . I waited . At length majestically he banded out fifty-six cents . The fat , older brother in the firm rode down in the elevator with me , he who used to move silently around the factory about four times a day , with a pleased air that bespoke one hundred per cent possession . He held his fat thumbs in the palms of his fat hands and benignly he was wont to survey his realm . Mine ! Mine ! Mine ! his every inch of being said . Going down in the elevator , he edged over to my corner . He pinched my arm , he pinched my cheeks . Ach , but he 'd miss me bad . Nice girl I was . Evidently he , too , had evolved a moral equivalent for a living wage . Little kindly personal attentions were his share for anything not adequately covered by twelve dollars and fifty-six cents .                   @ @
