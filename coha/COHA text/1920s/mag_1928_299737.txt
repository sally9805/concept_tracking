The militant glory of France may be summed up , today , in a pyramid of six great names : <P> Foch <P> Petain Lyautey <P> Joffre Franchet d'Esperey Fayolle <P> These heroes of the War , and these alone , received the gold-starred baton of a Marshal of France . <P> Last fortnight the right-hand cornerstone of the pyramid of names , Fayolle , was knocked out by Death ( TIME , Sept. 3 ) . <P> Last week the dead Marshal , Marie Emile Fayolle , 76 , was interred at Paris with greater pomp than has been accorded any Frenchman since the Unknown Soldier was laid beneath the Arc de Triomphe . <P> In the mourning procession paced the battle charger of Marshal Fayolle , with bridle down and empty boots reversed in stirrups . Ten officers followed , bearing on velvet cushions the Marshal 's baton , sword and blazing decorations seemingly numberless . <P> Nobly borne upon a rumbling gun carriage came the coffin of Fayolle , he who succeeded Petain and held Verdun through the dire summer of 1917 . Like most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Ecole de Guerre ; and time has vindicated his numerous original doctrines de la concentration des feux et des moyens ( theories of laying down a barrage ) . <P> Behind the coffin walked Prime Minister Raymond Poincar and Marshals <P> Foch , Petain , Lyautey , Franchet d'Esperey . <P> Where then was Joffre , the jovial , the well beloved ? Good " Papa " Joffre announced through his onetime aide-decamp , Colonel Fadry , that , at the age of 76 , he did not feel equal to a two-mile walk . The end of the walk was the Crypt of Honor at the famed Hotel des Invalides , near the great , domed , imperial tomb of THE CORSICAN . <P> In that place of transcendent glory , there seemed to stand , last week , merely four old men : Foch , 76 ; Lyautey , 73 ; Petain , 72 ; Franchet d'Esperey , 72 . <P> Ferdinand Foch was early nicknamed the " man of geometrical mind , " later the " man of will , " lastly the " Man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ecole de Guerre ; as the second a General of brilliant , pitiless strategy ; and at last he became the Generalissimo of half the World . Of all the Marshals of France Foch is the most keenly intellectual . <P> Joseph Jacques Cesaire Joffre is the " ThickHeaded Marshal , " if his many savage critics are to be believed . They concede that his phlegmatic refusal to be defeated at the Marne ( after appalling losses ) saved Paris . But they blame him for the still more titanic losses suffered by the Allies in their failure to push through the great Offensive of the Somme . Placid " Papa " Joffre is even now dictating his vindication , his book-and promises to spare no critic . <P> Louis Hubert Gonzalve Lyautey is the " Moroccan Marshal . " He was born in France but his spurs and his glory were won on the other side of the Mediterranean , in French Morocco , As High Commissioner and Resident General almost continuously from 1912 to 1925 , he pacified a robber rabble , waged reforms as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure foundations of a great colonial and commercial future .
