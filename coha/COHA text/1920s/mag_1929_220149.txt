England is nicer in lots of ways than Mexico , so much nicer that last week the civilian leader of the latest Mexican Revolution , Senor Don Gilberto Valenzuela , must have devoutly wished himself back at the Court of St. James 's , strutting again in silk knee breeches with a cordon across his chest as Mexican Envoy Extraordinary &; Minister Plenipotentiary . Instead he was desperately striving in the state of Sonora , first to bolster up civilian support for the army of his chief-of-staff , General Gonzalo Escobar , and second with the forlorn project of despatching to President Herbert Hoover a request that the ten most northerly states of Mexico be recognized as having seceded from the Mexican Union , and as constituting the Republica Mexicana de Obregon . <P> Thus by a gesture intended principally for local effect , Chief Rebel Valenzuela sought to identify himself with the magic name of his old heroic friend , General Alvaro Obregon , who was assassinated last year shortly after his re-election as President of Mexico ( TIME , July 30 ) . Last week indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was understood to have added a letter of fervent supplication to the documents despatched by Seor Valenzuela to Washington . <P> Of course it was all in vain . President Herbert Hoover had long since cast his sympathies against the rebels and on the side of squarejawed , gnarled-fisted President of Mexico Senor Emilio Portes Gil . Just to make assurance doubly ironclad , Secretary of State Frank Billings Kellogg told correspondents that " under no circumstances " would the State Department recognize the soi-disant and really nonexistent Valenzuela government . <P> Undaunted the rebels opened at No. 66 Beaver St. , Manhattan , an office which was called a ' " consulate " by the . self-styled " Consul , " Seor A. Jiminez . When reporters dropped in , the Consul assured them that merchandise shipped from the U.S. to Sonora and other states controlled by the rebels would be subject to a heavy fine unless registered with the consulate . Strolling back to their press rooms , and eying latest despatches from Mexico , the reporters could see at a glance how little founded were the pretensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This perhaps was unfortunate , for Senor Don Gilberto Valenzuela , who was Mexican Minister in London until late December last , is a really brilliant lawyer , a keen chess-player , teetotaler , nonsmoker , and a civilian , whereas Mexican governments are traditionally composed of militarists , traditionally corrupt . The nickname which his enemies have fastened upon him , El Capitan de los Cristeros , correctly indicates his Catholic sympathies , but is cruelly unjust in its literal connotations , " The Captain of the Christers . " <P> Calles after Escobar . " I give the revolution ten or 15 days more to live , " said President Portes Gil in Mexico City . " Our troops will capture Torreon , and after that it will be just a chase . "
