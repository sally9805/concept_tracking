THE CHARWOMAN 'S SHADOW - Lord Dunsany-Putnam ( $2 ) . <P> The slovenliest man in all Britain writes some of its loveliest prose . Lord Dunsany takes childish pride in the sag of his coat and the splay of his collar , what time he gets lost on a golden road to nowhere , beholding faery sights . Shadows are among his specialties . For The King of Elfland 's Daughter ( 1924 ) he invented a whole zone of twilight , where unicorns browsed and cabbage-roots were thunderbolts . Now he writes of a crone , cheated of her shadow by a magician of old Spain , and of a romantic worldling who came to the magician 's wood to learn the making of gold for his sister 's dowry ; of how this lad , one Ramon Alonzo , did not rest until he had rummaged through the magician 's spellbound shadow-box and found that which ends the story as all fairy tales should end . There is a certain philosophy of shadows woven through the pages , but the book is mostly music .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
