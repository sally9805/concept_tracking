txt Now , that General SMEDLEY D. BUTLER 'S S two years of " active service " as Director of Public Safety in the City of Brotherly Love are coming to an end , it is pertinent to quote from a letter written on Dec. 9 , 1924 , by President- COOLIDGE to Mayor KEN DRICK : The people of your city and your State are the only ones who are responsible for the conduct of their own municipal affairs . Unless they execute their own laws themselves , nobody can execute their laws for them . " Local self-government can not be enforced from the outside , " Mr. Coot. - ' nos maintained . General BUTLER , - who thought that it could when he assumed charge of the police force of Philadelphia , must be of Mr. COOLIDGE 'S opinion now . He came , he saw , but he did not conquer . He had his triumphs , but they were followed by admitted failures . In April of this year he said : " Cleaning up Philadelphia 's " vice is worse than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was tired of the job , but declared he was " going to stick it out to the end . " On Dec. 31 General BUTLER will return to his duties in the Marine Corps . In his first year as Director of Public Safety General BUTLER no doubt made life safer in Philadelphia . His war on banditry was successful . The city was so well patrolled by swift motor cars carrying police and- detectives that hold-ups ? were more dangerous to the thieves than to their selected victims . Crimes of violence of all kinds decreased . There were thirty-five fewer murders in the city than in 1923 and thirty-six fewer manslaughters . In his raids on gamblers the Director " breached the political wall , " something that had never been done before . He closed 125 " clubs . " The record showed an increase of 4,631 arrests for violations of the liquor laws , and many stills were destroyed . General BUTLER is as belligerent as ever , but it was only the other day that he charged one of his special squads with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " beating of drums ' and the fanfare " of trumpets , but still the liquor " flowed on . * * * The police have " been dishonest and have accepted " bribes . " In May he said that a conspiracy to violate the liquor laws existed : four hundred policemen detailed to guard the breweries had been unfaithful to their trust . A month later the General said : " I have tried every fnethod " conceivable to put an end to crime " and the flow of rum . From now on " until the time I leave Philadelphia " it is going to be a war to the " finish . " All , along General BUTLER has had to contend with more enemies than criminals and bootleggers : the brand of ward politician notorious in Philadelphia , pettifoggers as vicious as their clients , and citizens who would rather have the city " wet " and " open " than law-abiding . Numerically , the enemy has greatly exceeded the forces under his corrimand : That he has failed to enforce the Prohibition law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criminal classes and the politicians who are opposed to it ; Governor PINCHOT ' S influence has been exerted unavailingly in Philadelphia . The time has not come for passing finally upon General BUTLER 'S work as a policeman . He has laid his plans for another vigorous campaign , and hopes to breach still more walls . Whether it is work for a soldier to do , except in a great emergency , may be doubted . President COOLIDGE in his letter to Mayor KENDRICK disapproved of such details for " officers of the United States military forces . "
