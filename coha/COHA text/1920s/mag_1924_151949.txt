" Uncle Charlie " Patton , 85 , of Marion , Ohio , minus a piece of ear since the Civil War , and White House gardener since Warren G. Harding first took up his residence at the Executive Mansion , resigned his job . The LaFollette publicity department fairly bellowed the news : " Uncle Charlie is going back to Marion to vote for LaFollette . " <P> Senator LaFollette has been accused of proposing to do many terriblethings to the Constitution ; already he has brought about a condition in his home state which its Constitution never foresaw . <P> The Constitution of Wisconsin provides that , in the absence of the Governor , the Lieutenant Governor shall act in his stead ; and , in the absence of both these gentlemen the Secretary of State shall be Acting Governor . <P> Last week , Secretary of State Zimmerman had left Wisconsin , campaigning for LaFollette . So had Lieutenant Governor Cummings . Then , suddenly , Governor Elaine decided to do the same . Result : Wisconsin , sans Governor , sans Acting Governor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Roosevelt and devoted brother-worshiper , exclaimed in a political speech ( in favor of " my nephew , " Teddy Jr. ) in Manhattan : " My brother said of LaFollette in 1915 that he was a sinister influence working against Democracy and in 1912 he worked tooth and nail against the Progressive Party . He has not asked for the support of the Radicals today , but they are following him ; and , for contrast , I wonder whether you think Theodore Roosevelt would have allowed any unsolicited followers to wave the reg flag over his head ? " <P> The LaFollette publicity department told a good story to this effect : In the Capital , a Democratic rally was staged . A labor leader was invited to speak . He was expected , of course , to praise Davis . Instead he began : " I myself am a LaFollette man and I do n't care who knows it . " Promptly the amplifiers on the rostrum were turned off , and of the large crowd only a few in the front row could hear . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great possibilities for the use of the invention . By it , the alert campaign manager can not only shut off such unexpected attacks , but can silence any unpremeditated indiscretions of his own candidate . <P> Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes marched into Indianapolis on the heels of Candidate Davis , stepped to the lectern of Cadle Tabernacle , discoursed in part as follows : <P> Third Party . " When Senator LaFollette talks of what he will do when he is elected President , he may manage to keep a straight face , but he cherishes no such hope . . . . The campaign of Senator LaFollette is not to elect himself but to control the election and elect Mr. Bryan . . . . Was there ever a more miserable pretense than this talk of restoring the government to the people ? . . . It is Coolidge or Bryan . It is Coolidge or no election . " <P> Davis and Bryan . ' ' The first and most significant act of the Democratic candidate for President was to select Mr. Bryan as his running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country in Mr. Davis as a political leader . ... If , for the sake of political expediency , the Democratic candidate for President was willing to put this country at the risk of having Mr. Bryan as its President , where would he stop ? . . .
