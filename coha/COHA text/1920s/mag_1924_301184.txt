Benito Mussolini , hale and hearty and fresh from the recent Fascista victory in the General Election ( TIME , April 14 ) , was received with every mark of wild enthusiasm by the Romani , when he returned to the Eternal City from Milan . <P> Outside the Palazzo Chigi ( Italian Foreign Office ) a crowd estimated at 100,000 assembled to do honor to Il Duce ( the leader ) of Facism . Signor Cremonesi , Royal Commissioner of Rome , attempted to address the crowd , but it shouted him down with cries of " Basta , vattene ! " which , translated into , the vernacular , means " Enough , beat it ! " <P> Then Benito appeared on a balcony at the corner of the Corso and the Piazza Colonna . There was a momentary hush . Then 200,000 hands clapped and 100,000 voices bawled " Viva d ' Un a Noi " ( Three cheers for one of us ) . <P> Mussolini addressed the assembled Romani thus : <P> " Five million free Italian citizens rallied as one man round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we will not allow the Italian people to be insulted by attempts to make the world believe that they were herded to the polls like a flock of conscienceless beasts . <P> " Rome has marched in the forefront at elections . Our opponents said that the Roman Government clerks would not vote for us , but they have voted . They said that in Rome there is no population of workers . As head of the Government I wish once and for all to confute this miserable lie . <P> " Rome works ! Look around you and you will see energy and enterprise pulsating around you , because the Rome we dream of is not the capital of a small kingdom of antiquarians and must not rest content to be . How solemn is the following : ' Every one must surrender before what we have done , for what we have done is irrevocable . ' Our party has declared : ' We will give Italy five years of peace and fruitful work . ' This I have declared myself because whereas some people say : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we Fascist ! say : ' Become heart of our young nation , but it must become the wonderful capital of all the Latin world ! ' . . . You see that this victory leaves me quite calm because the greater is victory the greater are the duties of work , discipline and national concord , and I ask you Fascisti , will you perform these duties ? " <P> Here thundered 300,000 " Si 's " ( yesses ) . * <P> Benito continued : " I accept your monosyllabic reply as the formula of a solemn oath and ask you to raise the triple cry of ' Viva il Re ! Viva L ' Italia ! Viva il Fascismo ! " The crowd repeated the solemn oath with enthusiasm .
