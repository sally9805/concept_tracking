txt " I am out of it and from now on you fellows are going to do the work . " Mayor John P. Hylan , at yesterday 's meeting of the Board of Estimate , thus smilingly informed his associates of the board that until the end of his term of office it was his purpose to bear his official burdens as lightly as he could consistently . Within a few minutes after the conclusion of the meeting , which was concerned chiefly with routine matters , the Mayor gave tangible evidence that he meant what he had said . Accompanied by Mrs. Hylan and his son-in-law and daughter , Mr. and Mrs. John F. Sinnott , he left for an automobile tour of the Catskill Moustains . He does not expect to return to his duties in the City Hall until next Tuesday , or possibly later in the week . During their outing the party will visit the Mayor 's birthplace at Hunter , Greene County , N. Y. , and also his mother 's grave at Tannersville . ? The outward harmony that prevailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestive of the calm following the " twister . " There were missing the bitter exchanges that had characterized the clashes between the Hylan and the anti-Hylan factions of the board during the three preceding meetings , which occurred after the exigencies of the primary period had split the administration forces into hostile camps . Mayer in Merry Mood . The MOO 'S tttittt8 of distiODOititL ment , with which he had confronted his Public duties since the primary election , seemed to have yielded to a mood of philosophical and almost merry good humor . As the session progressed , he bandied quips with his colleagues . His manner was like that of the schoolboy when vacation days are near . At the end of the meeting he announced that the Committee of the Whole of the Board of Estimate , from which he already had resigned as Chairman , would meet neat Monday . " But , " he added with a chuckle as he tapped himself ton the chest , " it will meet with one member absent , as I am going on a little vacation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mayor 's resignation as Chairman of the Committee of the Whole , he told his associates that he should expect them to do the work from now on . His attitude left no doubt of the complete sincerity of his expressed purpose to retire to private life . The board , however , declined to act immediately on his resignation . At the suggestion of Borough President Henry Bruckner of the Bronx , it will come before a meeting of the board next Monday , while the Mayor and his family will still be away . Defers to " Majority Members . " In several instances it was made clear by the Mayor that he no longer seeks to dominate the board . In disposing of one of the routine items on the calendar he said : " Refer this to the majority members of the bdard indicating those who. stood with 0:vany and Tammany Hall , as I do n't desire to assume an authority which I have n't got . " The opposition of Deputy Controller Frank J. Prial , who was sitting as the representative of Controller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Plant and Structures , from receiving several departmental requisitions which he sought at the hands of the board . Mayor Hylan turned toward the Commissioner with a grin and commented : " See how easy it is for you to get things now , Mills . " A little later , when Chief Engineer Arthur S. Tuttle of the Board of Esti- mate was pressing for action on an appropriation involving some figuring , the Mayor chortled : " Wait a minute , Tuttle ; go slow ; I 'm not anxious - to work hard today . " When the meeting lagged and promised to be protracted beyond 12:15 P. M .. the Mayor shot glances at the clock and warned the members that they had better speed things up , as he expected to be clear of the City Hall and headed for the hills in fifteen minutes . Nobody seemed to be desirous of delaying the Mayor 's departure . The reina'inder of the calendar was hurried through and the Mayor left to begin his holiday . $6,000 PENSION FOR MAYOR . , Riegelmann Amendment , Which He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expressed intention to " retire to private life " eevived speculation yesterday concerning the amount of the pension to which he would be entitled as a member of the City Employes ' Retirement System if ' ee makes his exit from the public service Dec. 31 . Under an amendment to the law fixing the minimum age for service retirement of members of the City Env10r-es ' Retirement System , introduced by Edward Riegelmann , the Mayor 's close friend , who was then President of Brooklyn Borough and who now is a Justice of the Supreme ? Court , thee Mayor , - it was agreed by Finance Dtpaftment authorities , would undoubtedly become eligible upon retirement to an annual pension variously estimated at from $6,000 to $6,500 . The Riegelmann amendment reduced the minimum ages at which city cm , ployes. grouped into three general classifications , may , become eligible io retirement pensions , from 58 , 59 and tkr years , respectively , to 53. 54 and e5 1 years . Mayor Hylan falls into Class 3 , " clerical , administrative , professional and technical workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including heads of departments . " Members of that group are now eligible to pension retirement upon attaining the age of 55 years . Mayor Hylan , when he ends his term of office at the close of this year , will be more than 55 , but not yet 60 years old . It was that fact which ; at the time , Borough President Riegelmann intro1 duced the amendment , led to the char ; that it had been conceived primarily it the interest of the Mayor . Mr. Hylan , however , repudiated that ' " suggestion . He declared that he had no intention of retiring from the service of the city , and insisted that his approval of the amendment was prompted only by consideration for the hundreds of faithful and deserving city employe to whom it would prove a boon . If the Mayor should be offered a nomination to the Supreme Court bench by the McCooey Brooklyn organization forces , as some of his friends still ' eeneve he may be . and should he be elected to that office , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice of the State Supreme Court . serving in a metropolitan district , of $17,500 , of which $10.000 would b. ? chargeable against the city and $7,500 against the State . In that event , however . he would not , under the law , uc able to draw . in addition , his $6,000 a year as a former city employe . Illustrative of the operation of this restriction is the case of Joseph Haag. who was appointed assistant to the Mayor by Mayor Hylan . Mr. Haag ' ' or more than two years has occupied regularly an office in the basement of the City Hail . but he has not been permittei by Controller Craig to draw salary . the ground that before his nominatioe to that position he had been and continued to be a pensioner of the City Government . Mr. Haag has continued to do his work as an aid to Mayor Hylan and has never tested the issU ? in the courts .
