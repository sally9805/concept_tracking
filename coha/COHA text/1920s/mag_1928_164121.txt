BAD GIRL-Vina Delmar-Harcourt Brace ( $2 ) . On a Hudson River Sunday excursion boat-jazz under bright lights , petting in the shadows-Dot of the Bronx picks up Harlem Eddie ( not colored ) , gets goin ' with him steady , falls for him ( i.e. is seduced ) and thus becomes a bad girl . But she marries him next day , and soon enough has a child . Simply this and nothing more-but what more is there ? <P> Eddie Collins hides a heart of gold under a curt manner . He wo n't allow his young wife to continue as typist , because silently he remembers his work-ridden mother . Bored , Dot window-shops on Eddie 's forty-a-week , but Eddie refuses to buy furniture " on time . " Finally they find a drab little apartment where Dot busies herself with pink ruffled curtains , neat drawers of kitchen utensils , and ( rather than an abortion ) " keeping her baby , " to the raucous tune of " something good on the radio " - the delirious Democratic Convention of 1924 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unusual explicitness . The usual nine months occupy 125 pages . <P> Author Delmar , 23 , Bronx-bred herself , reports with winning sincerity the workaday story of small-town white Harlem . Except for formalistic lapses that smack of the copies and carbon copies of her typist days , Mrs. Delmar sticks to the racy inelegant talk of the Collins 's and their friends , and thus brings them into the limelight of current fiction , featured with Harlem blacks , New England neurotics , mid-western realtors , Manhattan flappers , Riviera swells . The Literary Guild has made Bad Girl its April choice , because " around the simple story is woven a background so authentic it has the quality of universality . "
