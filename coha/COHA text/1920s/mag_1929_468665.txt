THIS year of all the years that have passed since William Webb Ellis in 1823 " with a fine disregard for the rules of football first took the ball in his arms and ran with it , " is , of course , the greatest the sport has ever known . This fall , we are assured by the headlines in the press ? headlines that we are obliged to glance at whether we happen to be interested in football or not ? we are in the midst of such enthusiasm for the game as the country has never known . The crowds are greater , the interest keener , the competition better , the contests cleaner , the excitement among all sorts and conditions of men is more intense than it was last year ? when , as you remember , all records for crowds , interest , competition , cleanness and excitement were broken for the first time in twelve months . Never have tickets for the big games been so hard to get as this year . Never have speculators asked such outrageous prices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the press , so much electricity spent on evening practice , so many automobiles parked outside our bowls and stadia each Saturday afternoon , such hordes transported from X to Y in long special trains bearing big banners on their sides beseeching the team to " BEAT WISCONSIN . " No , never have the graduates , the undergraduates , the general public , and the Congressmen of the House of Representatives been so preoccupied with their football as they have this fall . Truly , this is the greatest of all seasons in the greatest of all American sports . Perhaps it would be just as well to admit at this point that the preceding lines were written on a hot afternoon in midsummer several months before the first kickoff . But never mind ; it is perfectly safe to make conjectures about the headlines in advance . For every fall is to the headline-writers the greatest in the history of football , and there is nothing to indicate that this year will prove an exception to the rule . With the help of the public relations counsel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges and universities of the land , it would be possible by the time this article appears to support the assertions in the first paragraph with facts and statistics . And thereby to prove , if proof were necessary , that a new high-for-all-time was made in November , 1949 , by Football Common . Or so , anyhow , it appears upon the surface . But is it really true ? Six barbers were busily engaged in trimming the locks of six undergraduates in a barber shop on the side street of an Eastern college town late one Friday afternoon in November in the year 190i , when a noise penetrated above the hum of conversation and the rhythmic clicking of the shears . It was indistinct , a vague and distant noise ; but a noise that persisted and grew slowly louder until the head barber heard it and paused , scissors upraised . In a minute the whole room was listening to the murmur , which was fast changing to a roar and then dissolving into the sound of two hundred and fifty young voices and two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near , the occupants of the barber shop , personnel and clientele , deserted the chairs for the plate-glass window in front of the store . The noise increased , and soon the head of the procession appeared : a group of happy youngsters in jackets and small caps perched on the back of their heads , bearing ou husky shoulders a youth in a football suit ? laced leather jerkin and the tightest of tight trousers ? the whole surmounted by an enormous shock of hair . Just behind came the band , a volunteer band , a band capable of little harmony but much sound , while at their heels staggered the entire freshman class , arm locked into arm , twisting in glorious ecstasy from one side of the street to the other and counting in unison . " One , two , three , four , FIVE . One , two , three , four , FIVE . One , two , three , four , FINE . One , two , three , four , FIVE . One ? two ? three ? four ? riv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sophomores 5-0 . The first test of college life had been successfully passed . It was a big moment in the history of the class of 1906 . Those were the days when classes were smaller and more compact , when everyone knew everyone else , when there was a feeling of class loyalty , of homogeneity , that does not and could not exist in a large university to-day . They were the days of Class Rushes and Class Bonfires and Bloody Monday Nights . Stadia and crowds of a hundred thousand people were unknown in those far-off days ; a crowd of thirty-five thousand people at a Yale-Princeton game drew headlines in the Sunday newspapers the following morning . Those were the days when Directors of Athletics and Supervisors of Athletics and Boards of Athletic Control were yet to come , when some bespectacled professor in the Greek Department managed the whole thing with the help of one or two undergraduates ; he it was who arranged the trips of the team , made out the schedules , passedover money for expenses , and saw to it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and evening news releases were sent out to the press by an Athletic Association panting for publicity , before a Director of Public Relations was considered a necessary part of every football squad ; the days when one umpire and one referee with an amateur timekeeper could handle a college football contest without a squad of assistants supplied with wrist whistles on leather straps , horns , megaphones , and other appliances to interrupt play and make sure that no one gets the better of the breaks . Those were the days when ineligibility rules were anything but closely defined , when it was not always wise to ask questions about your opponents for fear they might retaliate . Football in its early and undeveloped state lasted , with changes of a minor nature , from 1890 to about 1910 . Let us call this period the Rah-Rah period ; the term almost exactly connotes the condition of the sport during those approximate years . It was then still a game ; it had yet to reach the point in which canny observers in the colleges began to perceive that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the games were essentially college crowds , the men who played in the games were college men , the interest was chiefly confined to the colleges and had not yet spread to the general public . At this time intercollegiate football was divided into two groups : Yale , and the rest of the country . To show Yale 's supremacy at the time it is only necessary to point out that between the years 1890 and 1910 , the Elie lost but four games to Harvard and five to Princeton . This first stage of football , the Rah-Rah period , was in all truth the golden age of the sport . III The second period through which football in the East passed was the period of Big Business , from the year 1910 to 1924 . This period , like the first , must inevitably be loosely defined ; it is not my intention to set up arbitrary boundaries to the various phases of the development . But somewhere about 1910 football began to change in many ways . First of all , it was at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East began to be challenged . Yale was no more the Yale of Shevlin and Rafferty , of Hogan and Hinkey ; other names and other faces were occupying the headlines of the day in the sporting pages . The game had spread by this time to the Middle West and the Far West ; in fact , the state universities throughout the country had long before been developing teams that were at least as good as the Eastern teams . Whereas in the nineties football had been mostly a sport of the colleges along the Atlantic seaboard , by the first decade of the present century it could be justly called an American game , as popular ? and as well played ? at Michigan and Minnesota as at Princeton and Pennsylvania . The year 1910 was about the time when intercollegiate football first began to be recognized as Big Business . The Archbold Stadium at Syracuse , the first of its kind , was built in 1900 ; the Harvard Stadium was opened shortly afterward , in 1903 ; but the crop of bowls and stadia throughout the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost tempted to call this the Stadium Period . Yale presented her Bawl as a sacrificial offering to Mr. Mahan of Harvard in the fall of 1914 ; Princeton followed with the Palmer Stadium the next year ; and from then on there was an epidemic of stadium-building . Football Common was getting ready for the Big Rise . Harvard , ever the first to adopt new ideas regarding athletics , was perhaps the first university to perceive exactly how big the business of football really was . And the credit for this must fall to the late Major Fred Moore , at thetime Graduate Treasurer of Athletics , who realized that if the Stadium on Soldiers Field could be filled six or eight times during the season as it was filled for the game against Yale , a corresponding increase in the athletic revenue would naturally result . He it was who investigated the potentialities of a remarkable team from a college called Centre in Kentucky ; a team to which the newspapers that year were devoting yards of space . And when Bo McMillan led his famous " Praying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1920 , a capacity crowd was on hand for the fray . This was the day when Football Common jumped ten points before closing time . Now when more than one university in the United States takes in well over a million dollars each fall in gate receipts , when some teams travel as much as five thousand miles in the course of a short season of several months , and play to half a million spectators on a few successive Saturdays , we are apt to look back with something like contempt upon football 's Mauve Decade . But the sums and the crowds that are considered so small to-day were regarded as overwhelmingly large ten to fifteen years ago , and they brought the usual chorus of denunciation upon the game which has been going on since the beginning . This period was the period of the mass meeting with its bands and its frenzied oratory , the period when the special train was actually utilized as a means of transportation by the majority of the spectators on the visiting side , when the " support the team " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the undergraduate who failed to turn out to parade down to the field to cheer the team on its final practice before the Big Game was a traitor to the college . This was the period when a crowd of eighty thousand at the Yale Bowl caused a wave of excitement over the entire college world ; eighty thousand at two dollars apiece meant a hundred and sixty thousand dollars . Yes , that was beginning to he Big Business indeed . From a mere nobody who amounted to exactly nothing , the head of the Athletic Association gradually became a highly salaried gentleman with power comparable to that of the President , and at least a member of the faculty called " Professor " by his colleagues . Or by some of them , anyhow . This was the period when the vast edifice of hocus pocus which surrounds the game to-day was being built up . More money at the gate meant more money to spend ; longer trips , rests for the team on the night before the big games at the country club outside town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaches and backfield coaches and kicking coaches , bigger and better scouts to watch the rival universities , more doctors , trainers , rubbers , and supernumeraries to help spend the money which the stadium was bringing in and the team was earning . Money-makers like Notre Dame had not yet been visualized ; it took Middle Western brains and ingenuity to think up a scheme of this sort , to play in one season a schedule of games all away from home in places as far apart as Atlanta , Georgia ; Baltimore , Maryland ; and Los Angeles , California ; to run the football team of a university devoted to and intended for the cause of sound learning after the manner of a big league professional baseball club like the New York Giants . As a rule the football of the prewar period was run on piker 's lines ; but enough was seen to bring home to farsighted observers the gold in the football hills . The chart of Football Common took a marked upward swing between 1910 and the end of the War . IV The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game itself . Any impartial observer ? and by this term I mean any sportsman not brought up in the football tradition , not accustomed to the sport ? will watch it for the firsttime and tell you that this game is a dull affair . Rather is it the devotion of youth to a cause which makes it so appealing . Not the game itself , but the fact that it reaches and touches the sporting idealism of the American people , is what has made football our greatest national pastime . The average gambler would prefer to watch a Yale-Princeton football contest than the biggest professional baseball game or prize fight because he knows the former is not framed , whereas he may have his suspicions regarding the latter . This is the secret of the game 's popularity with the masses the country over . When , however , the youth of the nation , and the college youth particularly , begin to lose this sentiment of idealism about football , then is the time to look out for a decline in Football Common . When they begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town in which the college is situated , to feel that they would rather take out a canoe on the river or shoot some golf with the roommate than cheer at the last practice , then the future of Football Common assumes a bearish aspect . If , owing to external causes , the stock itself has not actually registered that decline , do not assume that the slump is not long overdue and that it is not on the way at the present moment . Let me once more insist that the periods into which I am arbitrarily dividing the rise and fall of intercollegiate football are not to be taken exactly or precisely but only approximately . Of the three , the final period is the hardest to limit in terms of years because , although it may be said to have begun with the post-war college generation , the change in temper which distinguished it has been most definitely noticeable since 1924 . Since about that time the attitude of the undergraduate toward sport in general and football in particular has undergone such a transformation ? in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey among the colleges will soon enough realize for himself that football enthusiasm is weakening at the center . The different feeling of the Eastern undergraduate not only toward sport but toward work is an accepted fact by those connected with our colleges to-day . While I was visiting Dartmouth last spring a young man was presented to MC who , besides being the leading athlete of the University , an important figure in extra-curricular activities , and a remarkable student , bore a new sort of distinction : he was an All-American football star who had dropped out of the game in his senior year in order to make Phi Beta Kappa ! It was generally assumed that this young man 's decision was altogether exceptional ; such in fact I took it to be until I had traveled to six or seven other universities where men who had made similar renunciations were produced for inspection . The fact is that the Eastern undergraduate to-day is as different from the undergraduate of fifteen years ago as he was from his predecessors of the nineties . Many reasons have been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that in this year of grace 1929 studying is no longer unfashionable . Quite the reverse . In most of the big Eastern universities the emphasis is now distinctly on the cultural side of college life . Much of the Eastern undergraduate 's change of attitude toward athletics has undoubtedly been due to this increased interest in intellectual achievements , to the stiffening up of the curriculum which has taken place of late years in so many colleges . He has far less time for sports and athletics . But what is more important , his mind has matured ; he takes far less interest in the spectacular side of collegiate games . Not only as regards sports and athletics , but as regards collegiate problems of all kinds , the Eastern student of this period has a much more discriminating outlook . Men will tell you this who have been connected with colleges for thirty years and more , but seniors also will testify to the difference in under graduate thought even in their own college life . The American student to-day is asking questions his elder brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered to ask if they had ! He is acquiring a new sense of values those gentlemen did not possess , and in no way is this plainer ? in the East , at any rate ? than in his attitude toward athletics . Do not assume that he does not care to see his university win . He does , most emphatically . But if the team loses , he is not going to let it ruin his fan . " The ones who take it hardest are the fellows who bet on the team , " said a wise undergraduate to me recently . The student of 1929 takes football in his stride , he considers the football game the focal point of a good week-end . But he is not going into sackcloth and ashes as his father did when the university team has a losing season , and the pleasing result is a lessening pressure upon the coach to turn out a winning eleven , a consequent refusal to obtain students for their playing ability , and a general raising of the scholastic standard . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown by the front pages of the Harvard Crimson , the student daily newspaper , in the years 1925 , 1926 , 1927 , and 1928 . On the day of the big football rally of I the season of 1925 there was a headline across the page about this rally and a streamer along the top : " THE TEAM WILL BE AT THE RALLY TO-NICHT . WILL 7.013 ? " The next year the streamer across the top merely announced in smaller type , " Rally at the Union To-night . " In 1927 the space at the top was bare of print , and the news space devoted to the rally had been reduced to a paragraph with a modest one-column head declaring that there was a " Rally To-night . " And in 1928 there was nothing at all in the Crimson about the rally ? because there was n't any rally . There was , however , a rally at New Haven that night . It was a distressing affair : barely five hundred undergraduates came into Woolsey Hall . Former Head Coach Tad Jones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delivered what the newspapers termed " a scathing arraignment " of the modern student , declaring that the old Yale spirit had vanished ; while another coach went so far as to call the undergraduates yellow for not supporting the team . Yet the fact remains that after the season of 1928 , which was the most disastrous any Yale eleven has experienced in years , the undergraduates behaved like men and not like children . Thirty years ago , when their fathers were young men on the make , such a season would have caused great uneasiness and discontent in the student body and a quick change in the coaching system . To-day the Yale undergraduate takes football as a game ; there was no demand for a change in the coaching system or in the sport last year at New Haven . A better or healthier football situation than exists to-day at Yale can not be found in the colleges . If the old Yale spirit that was expressed by yelling oneself hoarse at rallies and cheering in torchlight processions has vanished , is it not possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are seeking facts about the attitude toward athletics in the colleges , the one man you must at all costs avoid is the Director of Athletics . Of course he will welcome you cordially ; if you happen to be connected with a newspaper your welcome will be all the heartier . He is there to present you with reams of statistics proving that ninety per cent of the undergraduates take part in intramural athletics , that the coach is a high-minded aristocrat who cares nothing for winning games but merely wishes the boys to play because they love football , that everything in university sport is as nearly perfect as possible . Even if he is intellectually honest , he is obviouslya man with a job , and obviously anxious to have his point of view prevail . It is far easier , to be sure , to take your beliefs ready-made in canned doses from this gentleman than to tramp about from fraternity houses to dormitories in the rain , seeking that elusive thing , undergraduate opinion . But it is much less reliable . The facts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always an easy task ? and from no one else . But the effort was worth while ; get an undergraduate talking , and you will learn some startling things . My only wish was that some of the Athletic Directors could have been with me and heard their magnificent ninety per cent program of sports-for-all riddled by the remorseless humor of the American youth ; and that some of those football coaches whose names you see daily in the public prints as character builders could have listened with me to the verdict of their charges . The number of football players who told me they were sick of football was amazing . " I am sure of one thing , my kid will never play college football , " said a bitter undergraduate . " If you want to have fun in athletics , " said another , " do n't play football . " And at another university a brilliant tackle who had delivered some hard words previously to show that an after-game scolding by a sharp-tongued coach was not compensated for by the honors won , remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a necessary evil . " That the game was in an unhealthy state , that playing it was not entirely a pleasure , and that practice was simply drudgery , that to a large extent the player was exploited for and by the graduates and the public , was said to me by more than one gridiron star . I heard much caustic comment about what a sardonic young man described to me as " the professional alumnus . " " Why , the first thing these birds in my home town want to know is what kind of a football team we are going to have next fall . That 's the first question I 'm asked when I get home . " " That 's right , " said another , " they know all the players on the team by their first name , and they know all about men in my own class I never heard of . " Sentiments of this kind would have been considered heretical ten or twenty years ago . But the undergraduate of 1929 is more mature ; he can and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ca n't tell these chaps to go out and die for dear old Blank , " said the head coach of a great university team to me last year . " They 'd laugh in my face . " Precisely . So they would . But he could have told them that twenty years ago ; in fact . men did . " The boys just wo n't go out and spend the whole afternoon at a tackling dummy , " said another university captain to me . " There are too many interesting things to do about the campus . " And it is worth noting that as the Eastern undergraduate is beginning to ask whether the values of football are really as advertised , so he is asking the same question regarding other supposedly desirable crowns and prizes of college life . In every university I visited , with one exception , the editor of the daily newspaper confessed that it was harder to get out candidates than formerly , and that the quality was poorer . Candidates for managerial positions were also less numerous than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great " business training " which awaits the manager of the baseball team fails to attract men as it used to . A bright youth remarked to me , " I can get a better business training working summers in a bank . " When it becomes fashionable to study a man must of necessity spend more time on his work , and when he spends more time on his work he has less time or desire to spend cheering the football team at mass meetings . A Cornell junior , talking to me of the Committee of Seventeen , that famous committee of Cornell graduates which came to Ithaca last spring to salvage athletic prestige along the shores of Lake Cayuga , remarked iu the course of conversation that getting excited over football was " rather Middle Western . " You may not like this attitude , the Cornell graduate who watches his team get beaten 49-0 does not like it ; but that it exists at Cornell as it does elsewhere in the East is undeniable . It is not that the Eastern college man cares less for sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming tanks and squash courts and golf links , it could probably be shown that he spends more time in exercise than his elder brother did . But he does not like to feel that the President may lose his job if someone happens to drop a forward pass in the last minute of play . That this is a healthy attitude goes without saying . One of the most startling signs of it , one of the greatest victories for sport and for common sense , took place during the football season of 1928 only to be entirely overlooked by the metropolitan press . To whom the credit belongs is a question ; it happened at Princeton , so let us bestow credit upon that university . The night before the Cornell-Princeton game the two football squads dined together . It may sound like a small matter ; actually , it was a far greater step than most persons unconnected with intercollegiate football realize . As proof thereof I submit the remark of the football captain of another large university who solemnly assured me that such a thing was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he naively explained , the men might get to know one another and like one another at dinner , and then there would be no fight the next afternoon on the field . " For instance , " he added , " if you found out that the fellow beside you had a weak ankle you might feel you would n't want to go out for that ankle the next day . " Thank heaven , there are at least two universities in the country , Cornell and Princeton , where the archaic sporting philosophy that justifies " going out for FOOTBALL ON that ankle " can be put in the limbo of dead things where it belongs . VI One effect of the present craze for college life ? notice that I do not say for a college education ? has been that with hordes wishing to attend our universities , the authorities have been able to pick and choose their men . Thus the class which entered many endowed educational institutions this fall was selected sometime early last spring ; no more candidates have been considered since then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a better intellectual level of potential students demanded . This selective process of admission has had remarkable results , as is shown by the following figures taken from the Dean 's office of a large Eastern university . The class of 1924 had 37 men dropped for failure to keep up in class work . The next class lost 32 , the class of 1926 lost 29 , the number fell to 27 for the class of 1927 , to 25 for 1928 , the freshmen class of 1929 lost but 24 students , 1930 lost 17 , 1931 lost 12 , and 193e only 11 . Each class numbered 600 men . These figures are significant . The modern undergraduate in the East comes to college to study . A young man at New Haven put it to me this way : " The men do n't come here so much just to go to Yale . " Last May the freshman class at Georgetown announced through their President , Mr. Daniel Canning , that they " had come to college to study . " They rebelled against being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running track as freshman classes at Georgetown have done for years without number . This unprecedented rebellion was promptly quashed by the Student Council ; the striking thing was that it could have happened at all . And it will be interesting to observe the class of lose when they become juniors and seniors , and members of the Student Council themselves . Amherst went farther than most colleges ; there it was actually suggested , by one of the undergraduates , that intercollegiate football be abolished . James S. Stillman , the editor of the Amherst Student , who wrote the editorial in which this rash suggestion was made , did not pretend to speak for the whole student body ; but he certainly did express the opinion of a growing minority in the colleges which feels that all is not right to-day with intercollegiate sport . " Players , coaches , and spectators , " he said , " are not the only people who are dissatisfied with intercollegiate athletics . It is a general feeling in Eastern colleges . " This is undoubtedly true , if the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic seaboard . That things have moved more slowly in the South , the Middle West , and perhaps still more slowly in the Far West is but to be expected . For football , after all , was originally an Eastern game . Just as the orgy of stadium-building started in the East , it is only natural that the decline in undergraduate enthusiasm should first be felt throughout the older colleges of the East . Last fall when Princeton played Ohio State at Columbus it was noticeable that the atmosphere of the city was the same atmosphere which pervaded an Eastern college town twenty years ago . It was not only the college , but the entire town of Columbus , the entire state of Ohio , the entire Middle West which united against the invader . Merchants closed their shops , the day was a gala day , a big affair for the city . Whereas in an Eastern college city the game would have made little impression . That football still has the hold throughout the Middle West that it had in the East ten or fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Atlantic seaboard and then one in the Mississippi Valley region . I remember on the morning of an Illinois-Nebraska football game stepping off the train at the Champaign station to see a large white sign stretching almost the entire length of the platform : " WELCOME NEBRASKA . " I do not see any such sign in the Grand Central Station when Columbia is about to entertain a visitor at Baker Field ? or even at . New Haven or Boston . You realize the difference between the two attitudes toward football of the different parts of the country from the propaganda they broadcast . The most excessive broadsides are fired mostly from the Middle West . There are , it is true , one or two Eastern universities which flood the sporting offices of the metropolitan press with their releases every day ; but they are in the minority , whereas the colleges of the Middle West revel in this sort of publicity . One state university in the Mississippi Valley maintains a press bureau in New York ; every day this office is in close touch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and gives the vital information about the football situation to a waiting world through the newspapers . On the other hand there are many Eastern universities ? Yale and Harvard are two of them ? which rarely send out anything of this nature . They simply do not care whether the latest news about the star halfback gets into the papers or not and so they refuse to bother . Had such methods been thought of twenty years ago they would have been in the van of the movement . You also notice this difference between football feeling in different parts of the country by observing the attitude of the graduates . It is seldom that an Eastern graduate takes the trouble to call up the local newspaper to protest because his college is " badly treated " by the sports writers ; Middle Western graduates on the other hand are continually ringing up to demand why East Dakota was not mentioned on Monday morning when the r ? sum ? of the week 's contests was written . You can understand their feeling when you realize that throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get more publicity than the National Government and Henry Ford combined . But it is hard to imagine Yale men protesting because football news in Chicago does not feature their own second-rate eleven . Football was ? it is no longer ? an Eastern game . The first contest between Harvard and Yale took place in 1878 , the first between Minnesota and Wisconsin in 1890 . The first Yale-Princeton game was held in 1888 ; the first Conference game was played in 1895 . Naturally enough , the feeling about football is more advanced where it has been longest played ; in fact , it is hardly unfair to say that the Middle West is still in the Stadium Building Period , the Big Business Era of football through which the East passed a decade or more ago . The crop of stadia which have been springing up in towns like Urbana and Evanston and Ann Arbor are proof of this . There you have football as it was in the days just before and just after the War along the Atlantic seaboard . There you discover little discontent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the " pep rallies " enthusiastically and faithfully attended . Football still reigns King . A girl at a large Middle Western state university told me recently of the invasion of her sorority meeting by a male classmate who made an inspiring speech and practically demanded that the sorority sisters , like the fraternity brothers , give money to send the band on a several-thousand-mile trip to assist at an intersectional contest . Attached to the observation car of the train which carried the squad and supporters of the University of Nebraska east last year , was an electrically lighted sign " of scarlet and cream bearing the words u . OF N. CORNHUSKERS . Each car and pullman was equipped with cards placed in the windows with NEBRASKA written on them . " And the student daily , commenting on the departure of the team , said : " Approximately two thousand students gathered in front of Social Science and marched to the depot for a rally as FOOTBALL ON the team , coaches , and band entrained for West Point . The rally and send-off yesterday shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student body is behind its team . " " The old Nebraska spirit . . . " " behind its team . . . " These phrases have a curiously reminiscent ring . They were the sort of thing that was current throughout the East some fifteen or twenty years ago . To-day a new sentiment has superseded this feeling ; it has gone West to college for the time being . If the feeling throughout the Middle West regarding football is that of the Big Business period ten or fifteen years ago in the East , the sentiment in the Far West might be likened to that of the Eastern Rah-Rah days of the even remoter past . Remember that I am talking of the feeling toward the sport , not the sport itself . My football friends assure me that teams like Stanford under the good Doctor Warner are simply playing modified Eastern football to-day . That is as it may be . But in its reactions to football and its attitude toward the game , the Far West is not ten or fifteen but twenty or thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwavering , there you will find no evidences of rallies being abandoned , of students deserting the stadia . In fact only in the earliest stage of the disease could a great football saturnalia like the Tournament of Roses arise and flourish . VII It will be pointed out , and correctly too , that football has more of a vogue with the general public than formerly , that interest among the outside public over the sport is more intense than ever it was . But football ? Mr. C. C. Pyle will testify to the truth of this statement ? is essentially a college game . And the important thing about the decline of interest in football among the Eastern undergraduates is that it is taking place at the very core of the institution , where football was born so to speak , and among those young men who in ten years will be graduates and in twenty trustees of their alma mater . If the leaven continues to work , as there is little reason to suppose it will not , football in ten years will have vastly less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does to-day , no matter what the outside public thinks about it . I expect to be faced with the charge that this classification of football feeling into three periods is unjust and unfair to many universities which fit into none of these classes , and also that it is typically Eastern in outlook . I expect to be told that whereas many of the state diploma mills of the Middle West are in the Big Business era of football , others are not . I admit all this . No classification of the sort can be anything but loose and roughly defined , for if colleges like Ohio State , Illinois , Iowa , and Minnesota arc fairly well committed to the policy of good teams , large stadia , and all the rest of the big business of football , it is none the less a fact that some of their neighbors like Michigan and other Conference colleges ? for reasons derived from geographical location , early founding , and closer contact with other parts of the country ? have less of the traditionless , new building atmosphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is approximately correct and that it will become more so as time and football go on . How long the Middle Western collegian will take to view the game as his Eastern brother does no one can tell . A prominent undergraduate from a state university in the Middle West says , " There is little danger of football dying out in the West for a long time to come , if for no other reason than that it is good business , and undergraduates will always be undergraduates in regard to their varsity . " Certainly football is good business , and certainly the Middle West is in the throes of it as regards football ; but if the Eastern collegian is any criterion , the undergraduate will not always be an under- graduate with regard to his varsity . That the undergraduate of the Middle West will some day swing round to the Eastern point of view seems inevitable to anyone who sees the progress of football in perspective . " There is a tide in the affairs of men . . . " In the nineties and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best football teams were in the East , where was the greatest concentration upon the game . To-day the point of greatest concentration has spread through the Middle West to the Far West ; there we find the best elevens of the present , the champions of the future . As the Eastern colleges begin to care less about the game and , therefore , less about producing winners , they will produce fewer winners . From now on you will undoubtedly see , as you have seen in recent years , an overwhelming string of victories whenever teams from the Pacific Coast cross the continent . The days of the Rah-Rah period in the East , when an All American eleven consisted of a half a dozen pupils of Mr. Walter Camp with perhaps several recruits from Princeton and Pennsylvania , have gone never to return . The Rah-Rah spirit in football has gone to the Far West where they have the men , the coaches , and , most important of all , the enthusiasm to develop winners . The East , on the other hand , lacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time ) to follow . I appreciate perfectly the reply that will be made to this contention . It has already been made to me several times ; it was best expressed by a Middle Western undergraduate who knows his football the country over . " Can it be , " he says , " that the older Eastern institutions , no longer able to compete with those farther west , have come to adopt a sour-grapes attitude ? " Let us admit frankly that this is not an irrelevant suggestion . But if football in the East has fallen off simply because the Eastern teams can not develop winners , what then about intercollegiate baseball ? Is there not a parallel between the two games ? Few observers will deny that despite vigorous efforts to resuscitate the sport , such as intercollegiate baseball leagues and the like , baseball in the Eastern colleges is on the way out . I attended a game between two large Eastern universities last May at which fifty spectators were present . Yet Eastern college baseball is but little inferior to Western college baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the corresponding decline of interest in football be the cause rather than the result of the defeat of Eastern by Western elevens ? Interest in football is definitely on the wane in parts of the Eastern collegiate world because the Eastern undergraduate has gone through the early stages of the football disease and is slowly convalescing therefrom . This disease , which is now attacking the Middle West , and the Far West in even more virulent form , will pass away as it is passing away along the Atlantic seaboard today . Do not , I beg , construe this as meaning that the end of football is in sight , that our celebrated coaches will no longer be able to syndicate their articles in the daily press next fall , that in a few years the Yale Bowl will resemble the Colosseum at Rome . It may take the huge outside public a long time to realize that football is weakening at the center . The headlines will probably continue to extol the sport as attracting crowds and breaking all manner of records for years to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will die ; what I am referring to is not the sport of football but the religion of football , the great business edifice of football , in short , the football mania . This it is which shows undeniable signs of being on the wane . If you are interested in Football Common my advice at present is not to hold for a Iong pull .
