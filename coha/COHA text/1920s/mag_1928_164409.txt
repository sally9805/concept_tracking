Few Egyptians are so well posted as to know that the Link Belt Co. of Chicago ( silent chains for automobiles ) was founded by that same William Dana Ewart who won Egyptian gratitude by using Link Belt profits to found and endow the American University in Cairo . <P> Last week Egyptians were further grateful to U. S. philanthropy when a new and sumptuous lecture hall for the American University was opened . The donor remains anonymous , but was represented at the dedication , last week , by Mrs. Ruth Litt of Manhattan , a lady of wealth so unobtrusively engaged in good works that her name has seldom heretofore been seen in print .
