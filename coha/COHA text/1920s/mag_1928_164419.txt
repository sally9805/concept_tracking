The jaunty , clean-limbed incumbent of the $30,000,000 Peacock Throne of Persia was once a swashbuckling bandit , Reza Khan . Today he is the Shahinshah , Reza Shah Pahlevi : " The King of Kings , Reza Pahlevi , Shah of Persia . " He indulges in such luxuries as to allow to his 10-year-old son the Valiahd ( Crown Prince ) a civil list ( allowance ) of $2,000,000 . But withal Shah Reza has not grown effte or enervated . The old eagerness for battle kindled in his veins , last week , when news came that rebellious tribesmen were stirring in Luristan and had assassinated the Shah 's Minister of Public Works , the Emir Lashkar . <P> Ripping out a brace of terse orders , the King of Kings dynamically prepared to lead an army into Luristan . But someone must reign at home , in Teheran , during his absence . A happy thought ! His Majesty would make the 10-year-old Valiahd temporarily Regent of Persia . The lad should do something to earn his $2,000,000 a year . <P> Swiftly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went before the Majlis ( Parliament ) and presented to that assembly as Regent the boy , Shahpur Mohammed Reza Pahlevi . The lad , trained to drill and play war games from infancy , made a trim , soldierly appearance . The Majlis cheered him and he held his head high . But afterwards his nether lip trembled as his father bade him goodbye and set forth , jauntily , to lead an army into Luristan.
