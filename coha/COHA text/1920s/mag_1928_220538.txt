Daniel Ser-ruys , Permanent Chief of the Ministry of Commerce . His schedule is primarily designed to win farmer votes at the spring election . It sharply reduces the duties on farm tractors , doubles or triples those on many foodstuffs , and abolishes the duty on U. S. wheat seed , now popular in France . Sugar , from the U. S. , which France has not heretofore imported , should flow in if the bill becomes law , for it would reduce the duty on sugar from 290 francs per 100 kilos to 100 francs. * <P> The Cabinet approved and President Doumergue signed , last week , a decree restricting the showing of foreign films in France . This measure creates a board empowered to reject any foreign film if the country of export is not exhibiting a generous quota of French films . Last year 368 U. S. films were shown in France , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decree will become operative on March 1 , 1928 . <P> Before the Chamber of Deputies , last week , was a bill based on the assumption that when certain French oil properties in Mosul are developed the Republic will be able to exist on its own oil .
