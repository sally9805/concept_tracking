txt Outstanding in today 's developments in connection with the international conference is that the nations most affected by the American program for a reduction and limitation of armaments are showing no disposition to complicate the situation by injecting new elements . The British delegation reached the conclusion at a meeting today that its part in tomorrow 's open session demanded a careful avoidance of suggestions not germane to Secretary Hughes 's proposals . Under this agreement there will be no counterproposals from Great Britain . The Japanese are understood to have the same purpose . Certainly the attitude of Japan 's spokesmen in the conference has been correct enough to satisfy the most punctilious stickler for propriety . Nothing said or done by the Japanese can ' be construed as carping or unfriendly , and the impression created by their course is.regarded es an augury of conference success : This impression is all the more remarkable in view of a general belief ? that from the outset of the conference the Japanese would begin to play . for position and show a temper indicative of the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Japan the defendant before a world court . President Harding and Secretary Hughes , by their tactful handling of the situation , have apparently convinced all the participating nations that this is a conference of equals . There has been no act on the part of the Government or the American commission to give color to suspicion of unfriendly intent toward any of the Governments concerned . It is known that the American Government does not like the Anglo-Japanese alliance , and would be pleased to see it terminated , but there has been nothing to show that it contemplates any radical procedure to obtain that end . The disposition of this Government le rather to bring about an arrangement between Great Britain , Japan and the United States that would remove the dangers of war that exist in the Far East and the Pacific . Such an arrangement would be pleasing to Great Britain and the British overseas dominions . The happy start of the conference is looked upon as a move in that direction . Balfour to Read Statement . In his speech before the , conference tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of armament limitation and reduction from a British viewpoint , will confine himself to what Mr. Hughes proposed . He will not suggest that Great Britain thinks some other plan more desirable or attempt to show that the American plan Is not workable , but will accept the plan " In principle " in behalf of Great Britain and will then proceed to discuss points which the British delegation believes should be considered-with a view to amendment or modification . The importance which the British delegation attaches to Mr. Balfour 's statement is indicated by a little sidelight . Mr. Balfour has frequently prepared speeches in advance with great care but it was explained today that he never used his manuscript in delivering them . He has evidently been a believer in the thcpry that a public address loses much of its force and grace if read to the audience . But tomorrow , for the first time , Mr. Balfour is to read the speech he has prepared . In his statement he will point out that in the opinion of the British delegation the proposals of the American delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reduction of British and American submarine tonnage to 00,000 each . While at the end of the World War , according to British figures . British submarines had an aggregate tonnage of 131,65S , there has been considerable , scrapping of undersea craft singe and it is stated that the tonnage of . British submarines is now below 90,000 . The British contention is that nations should cut their submarine tonnage below the figure proposed by the United States and should not be permitted to go above the present figures of the royal navy . According to British opinion , too many submarines in one fleet is a bad thing for the world . Anott er point to be urged by Mr .. Balfour tomorrow concerns , the proposed naval holiday of ten years . If that proposal is adopted , the ? British ask , what is to be the fate of shipyards which are dependent to- some eXtent on warship construction ? And what is to , become of tte plants for ' manufacturing armor plate ? If at the end of the ten-year naval holiday , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building warships , factories for making armor , how is the resumption to take place ? The situation as it is viewed by the British , was likened today to an agreement among newspaper publishers to abandon the use of typesetting machines for ten years . The person acquainted with the British view , who used this illustration , said that when newspapers sought to resume typesetting by machinery at the end of the decade they would find their expert operators driving taxicabs or engaged in other occupation and unwilling to return to an occupation so precarious . As for the typesetting machines themselves , they would be too rusty for use . The same consideration has been voiced in the last forty-eight hours with respect to the American warship ' mailing and armor plate industries , : 3 Lel It is likely that Secretary Hughes and his associates in the conference will hear a good deal on the subject before any decision is reached . It is asserted that unless the American Government provides a means of replacing warship building and armor Industries , much hardship will be caused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government should by mail subvention or other means encourage the construction of merchant steamships of the largest size . If this were done , it is held , the plants ca pable of building ; such large vessels would be converted within a reasonable period into plants for building warships . There are navy yards in both the United States and Great Britain where the largest annorclacls are constructed , but the fate of ' the private shipyards , which have depended to a large extent on contracts from the Government for building warships , will be uncertain , according to opinion voiced here . While Mr. Balfour may refer to the ma tter , it is known that there is some British criticism of that feature of the American plan , which provides that each of the three naval powers shall scrap certain specified warships , mentioned by name or number . The British reaction2 to this is that . while the United States had a right to name the vessels which it was willing to scrap , it should leave discretion to Great Britain and Japan in carrying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designation of groups of warships from which the vessels to be scrapped should be chosen by the Governments . Committees Hold Meetings . The conference Committee on Program and Procedure with respect to armament held its first meetin today . After its meeting the committee authorized the publication of this formal communique : Nov. 14 , 1921 . The Committee on Program and Procedure with respect to the limitation of armament , appointed by the conference in its session of Nov. 12 , met at 11 A. M. Monday , Nov. 14 , at the Pan American Building , there being present the following delegates : Messrs . Hughes ( Chairman ) , Balfour , Briand , Schanzer and Kato , with their respective secretaries . It was decided to recommend to the conference the appointment of a committee , composed of all the plenipotentary delegates of the United States , the British Empire , France , Italy and Japan , to examine and report to the full conference with respect to limitation of armament , and with power to set up such subcommittees as it might from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee and of the conference , undertook to submit this proposal to the conference . Mr. J. Butler Wright was nominated as Secretary to the Committee On Program and Procedure with respect to limitation of armament . It was agreed that ' the delegates should be given an opportunity to speak , if desired , at the meeting of the conference tomorrow concerning the proposals of the delegation of the United States with regard to limitation of armament . The committee on program and procedure with respect to Far Eastern and Pacific questions also met today . This communique was issued later : November 14 , 1921 . The Committee on Program and procedure . with respect to Pacific and Far Eastern questions , appointed by the conference in its session of Nov. 12 , met at 3 P. M. , Monday , Nov. 14 , at the PanAmerican Union , there being present the following delegates : Messrs . Hughes ( Chairman ) ; de Cartier de Marchienne , Balfour , Sze , Briand , Schanzer , Shidehara , Van Karnebeek and d'Alte , with their respective secretaries . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a committee composed of all the plenipotentiary delegates of the United States . Belgium , the British Empire . China , France , Italy Japan , the Netherlands and Portugal , to examine and report to the full conference with respect to Pacific and Far Eastern questions , and with power to set up such subcommittees as it might from time to time deem desirable . Mr. Hughes , as chairman of the committee and of the conference , undertook to submit this proposal to the conference . Mr. J. Butler Wright was nominated as secretary to the Committee on Program and Procedure with respect to Pacific and Far Eastern questions . lags would be held behind Closed doors and that the public would get a glimpse of the proceedings only when , in their capacity as committeemen , the delegates have an important decision to report to the conference as a whole . The committee plan is said to have been agreed to as the most direct method of attack on the problems before the ' conference , since it would permit greater ' liberty of confidential expression between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the procedure that would be necessary should the sessions continue in the open . Another argument used by those who favored the proposal was that it would facilitate such modifications of program as might become necessary through changes in the personnel of the delegations and in the diplomatic situation confronting the conference . One result of the decision may be to make tomorrow 's open session of the conference the last of those which precede the period of actual decision of the questions on which the negotiations hinge . The most optimistic officials do not expect the committees to be able to report without long study and debate . It is pointed out that there is no injunction against an open committee meeting , but tile likelihood of such a development is generally conceded to be remote at , the present state of the negotiations . An additional result , at least at the beginning , will be to permit the whole body of delegates to deal with subjects before the conference instead of leaving the decisions to the " Big Five " or the " Big Nine . " Creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should that step be found advisable . Details of what took place at today 's committees ' meetings were kept in closest confidence , but it was indicated that Secretary Hughes , for the American delegation , had proposed open sessions in principle , with frequent executive sessions , the results of which should be made public . Some of the other Governments wanted absolute secrecy , and the committee plan was decided on by way of a compromise . The naval armament proposal of the American Government came before the delegation heads incidentally in their discussion of procedure , and at the suggestion of Premier Briand of France it was decided that each interested nation should first inform the Armament Committee how much of the American plan it could accept and what parts it considered necessary to amend . Suggested substitutions for inacceptable portions would be submitted as the negotiations proceed . Britain Wants Submarines Outlawed . Great Britain 's acceptance " in principle " of the American proposals for limitation of naval armament contemplates an alteratiorl of the plan in several important details . Mr. Balfour may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Great Britain wishes to make , but they are substantially described in this way : Instead of a. flat ten-year holiday , Great Britain wants the replacement program to be an elastic one  --  spread over ? a period of years . Great Britain would like to see the submarine outlawed from naval warfare . Failing this , she wants to see their tonnage and equipment distinctly limited . The United States , Great Britain feels , would Lave her at a disadvantage in airplane-carrying ships , under the terms of the American proposals , because while Great Britain has an equipment of these craft , the United States would have to build new the number allotted . They would be of later design and superior improvement , while tie British ships Would be obsolete . Great Britain wants the replacement program spread over a. period of years , because , British naval experts argue , the program could be carried on with a very small equipment of building plant at a small scale , probably a ship at a time . If a flat ten-year holiday were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesale replacement at the end of ten years would have to be kept in organization . Such a program , the British naval ex " - perts say , does not go to the root of the question . Therefore they will propose that , for instance , a one-ship production equipment be left to each nation , to fit in with a replacement program , extending over a period of years , And that the immense properties , equipment , technical staffs and other organization , which would have to be kept in readiness to take up a replacement program in ten years , be dispensed with . Acceptance " in principle " of the American program is taken by observers to mean that Great Britain will not close her acceptance finally until the conference has proceeded to conclusions in the cases of France and Italy , and it may be further conditioned upon the development of the discussion of Far Eastern affairs . Committee i:voids Fall Fabileity . ' WASHINGTON , Nov. 14 ( Associated Press ) . ? The real work of the armament negotiations was transferred today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee room . After a debate , which developed widely separated views on the advisability of giving publicity to the negotiations , the big five , comprising the chief delegates of the United States , Great Britain , France- , Italy and Japan , settled on the committee plan as the only acceptable solution . To one committee , whose membership will be identical with that of the full conference itself , was assigned the task of working out a solution for the Far Eastern question . Another , composed of all the delegates ' of the five great powers , was created to take over the negotiations on the main topic of armament limitation . Since only the delegates of the five powers are qualified to act on armament limitation in the conference , the result in each case will be to resolve delegates into a " committee of the whole . " Although no official would make a prediction prior to the assembling of the new " committees . " the presumption evqrywhera toilgbl was that the meet           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
