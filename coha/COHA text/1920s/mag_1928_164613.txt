Stirred by June headlines to its quadrennial semiconsciousness , the body politic of the U. S.-the so-called " silent vote " which really decides presidential elections - began last fortnight to divide , if not into Republicans and Democrats , at least into Hoover voters and Smith voters . In many an instance the final determination of the individual to vote for Hoover or for Smith will not occur until November . A pretty girl at the polling booth , or an ugly man , or a hangover , a new hat , a spun coin , will be the deciding factor . <P> Practically all such votes will , however , cancel each other , as required by the law of equal chances . The weighty , decisive body of votes will be moved by instinct . In the last analysis , such issues as the campaign will present will sum up in two questions which instinct alone can answer : <P> 1 ) Does the voter dislike or does he desire , at this time , the idea of a change , a transition from something familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. ? <P> 2 ) Which candidate 's personality appeals most to the voter ? <P> Besides the rabble of chance voters , the mass of instinctive voters and the organized ranks of strictly party voters , there will be a limited class of voters to whom it will occur that , while an individual vote is infinitesimal in deciding the outcome , still an individual vote is interesting to cast . Many a voter in this class will plan , this summer , to do some political-historical reading . He will want books that are general and complete rather than specialized treatises on a few eras , issues , men . <P> Following is a two-party shelf of current publications well suited to the requirements of persons desirous of taking thought before voting : <P> THE REPUBLICAN PARTY : A HISTORY-William Starr Myers-Century ( $4 ) . Dr. Myers , Princeton professor , writes studiously , comprehensively , unexcitingly , dependably . <P> THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY : A HISTORY-Frank R. Kent-Century ( $4 ) . Mr. Kent , hot-pointed commentator of the Baltimore Sunpapers , strives for quiet lucidity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest party . <P> HERBERT HOOVER : A REMINISCENT BIOGRAPHY-Will Irwin-Century ( $3 ) . Mr. Irwin , a college mate of the Beaver Man , inclines to glorify but introduces enough facts to clarify . <P> ALFRED E. SMITH : A CRITICAL STUDY-Henry F. Pringle-Macy-Masius ( $3.50 ) . Mr. Pringle , an unassuming member of the Naked and Unashamed Club of free lance correspondents , reports frankly , fearlessly , sternly , not without humor . <P> TAMMANY HALL-M . R. Werner-Doubleday-Doran ( $5 ) . A biographer of eccentricians ( Barnum , Brigham Young ) , Freedom , suffrage , peace . Mr. Werner reproduces all the war-paint and peacetime paint , all the cardinal sins and probable virtues of a famed phenomenon , in a manner calculated to sell books . <P> THE PRESIDENCY VS . HOOVER-Samuel Crowther-Doubleday-Doran ( $2.50 ) . Mr. Crowther , a skilled publicist , lengthily educes the candidate 's fitness for office from his record in other offices . <P> PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRACY-Alfred E. Smith-Edited by Dr. Henry Mos-kowitz-Harcourt , Brace ( $3 ) . Dr. Moskowitz , husband of a skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the candidate 's addresses and state papers speak for themselves , aided by selection and arrangement .
