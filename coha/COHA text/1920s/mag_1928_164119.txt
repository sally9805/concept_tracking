Sotheby 's auction rooms , in London , are in a large house , full of dark carpeted passages , like tunnels under the ground . One of these passages leads to the big gallery which , one day last week , was inhabited by a curious and excited crowd . The walls of the gallery were covered with brown burlap and old paintings . In front was an oak pulpit and the auctioneer . <P> The people who had come to bid were sitting around a long U-shaped table below the auctioneer 's pulpit ; behind them was a crowd of 300 spectators . The most important prospective bidders were four : B. D. Maggs , representing Maggs Brothers of London ; W. Roberts , London bibliophile , representing Gabriel Wells , Manhattan book dealer ; E. H. Bring , president of Quaritch 's , London dealers in rarities , reputed to be representing the British Museum ; and a squat man with a pince nez , Dr. Abraham Wolf Rosenbach , one of the members of the famed Rosenbach Co. , Philadelphia dealers in rare books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the auctioneer . <P> " A hundred pounds , " said Mr. Maggs , as if he had been voicing a contradiction . <P> Dr. Rosenbach raised him a hundred . Mr. Maggs jumped another hundred . After 1,000 , Mr. Maggs tried to slow down the bidding , but Dr. Rosenbach went on raising him , 100 or more at a time . When Dr. Rosenbach bid 1,500 , Mr. Maggs kept silent and the auctioneer announced that Dr. Rosenbach had bought a first edition copy of Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll , inscribed by the author to his friend , Mrs. Dinah Maria Mulock Craik , author of John Halifax , Gentleman . Then the auctioneer raised his hand and lowered his voice . <P> " Number 319 , " he said . " Five thousand pounds , " said one of the men at the table , in a voice that sounded as though he thought the matter was now settled for good and all . " Six thousand , " said another . " Seven thousand , " said the third . <P> It was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 . Mr. Dring would jump first , Mr. Maggs would outbid him , then Dr. Rosenbach would go over both of them . Dr. Rosenbach never outbid the proxy of the British Museum until his English competitor had done so . After 10,000 , the price went up more slowly . " Ten thousand and a hundred , " said Mr. Dring . " And a hundred , " said Mr. Maggs . Dr. Rosenbach took off his glasses ; " And a hundred , " he whispered . For one round , each raised the other 10 , as if they were all nearing the limit . The gallery sat back , talking and sighing . They wanted to see the Museum get it , not to have it leave England ; but they began to see that there was no way to pass the bids of the collectors . Sure enough , at 12,500 Mr. Dring stopped and Mr. Roberts , looking out for his American client , picked up the bid . Mr. Maggs dropped out at 13,500 . Mr. Roberts and Dr. Rosenbach went faster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fifteen thousand , ' ' said Dr. Rosenbach . " Fifteen thousand , two hundred , " said Mr. Roberts . " Four hundred , " said Dr. Rosenbach . Then he took off his glasses and wiped them . There were no more bids . <P> " Goodness me , " said the auctioneer , mopping his face with a handkerchief . He had just sold the original manuscript of Alice in Wonderland .
