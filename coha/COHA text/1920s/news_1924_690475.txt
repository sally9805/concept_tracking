txt " It 's a great pool market , " commented the head of one of the largest wire houses in Wall Street as American Can broke through 127 for a new 1924 high and Steel sold at 109 last Saturday . This comment aptly described the stock market which started upward about two months ago and has witnessed trading of over 1,010,000 shares daily in the last twelve trading days , Saturdays excluded . Like all previous markets . it had its foundation when prices were depressed , last May , the particular reason for the low prices being the effect of political hysteria on business . The buying then was of the accumulating character which always steps in when prices get under values . As improved condition. ; gradually confirmed the judgment of buyers around the lows , an unexpectedly large advance in grain prices further stimulated buying with the result that stocks all through the list were sponsored by different groups . To name specific stocks which pools , groups or individuals are sponsoring would necessitate a recital of almost the entire list. , It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in this category the motor truck stocks , Mack and White , would be the leading examples . It is an axiom that there is little new in stock markets , but this bullish situation certainly can boast of some things different . The rails , for example Unsponsored , frowned on , legislated against and generally disregarded for a decade , they suddenly come into genuine favor through the urge of good earnings and consolidations . The Van Sweringens , with their " Four Iron ' Horses , " Nickel Plate , Chesapeake igz Ohio , Erie and Pere Marquette , arc credited with conducting the greatest concentrated buying in rails witnessed for many years . Their operations should be added as a potent factor in the public finally deciding it should own some rails . An instance of this concentrated buying is offered by a broker of many years ' exrerience in big operations . He visited the Erie crowd to check up on things and found the bid and asked prices on the common one-eighth apart . In response to his inquiry as to how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000. 20,000 or 40.000 shares , Or as much as he had to offer . An unlimited btiying order was what that meant . Another extreme furnished by the present market is the activity in a class of stocks like the express companies which have been dormant for years . Activity there , of course , is only . relative compared to the active leaders . Yet American Express at 119 is up 31 points from the year 's low . The copper stocks finally have responded to Dow , Jones &; Co. ' s presentation of ' the strong trade position with consumption at a new record , exceeding production by 88,000,000 pounds in the first half of 1924 . A fortnight ago copper stocks started on what appears to be their biggest market since the boom in 1917 . In one day six listed coppers aggregated 110,000 shares of trading , nearly 10% of the day 's business . Two apparent paradoxes are furnished by oils and steels . Sinclair passed its common dividend , and crude oil and gasoline prices were cut , yet in a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steel passed its common dividend and in eight trading days U. S. Steel common advanced eight points . The point about these apparent conflicts with news is that buyers of stocks believe conditions in steel and oil will improve . There are strong groups sponsoring such leaders as American Can , Baldwin , New York Central , Southern Pacific , General Electric , Studebaker , Union Pacific and others . Friends of New Haven are back of the buying there , based on the first surplus in eight years , as indicated by half year 's profits . Even Interborough Rapid Transit has a group back of it because of improved earnings , the resultant advance in price causing the first real short interest in that stock in years . Mail order stocks , Sears-Roebuck and Montgomery Ward , were pushed forward when the former restored its dividend after three years and greater wealth of the farming community insures larger buying power . Department store stocks respond also on larger wealth of the nation , while chain store stocks , big earners in good times and bad , have their show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general strength on the urgent buying of special stocks for control . Concentrated buying in this group is strikingly like that in certain rails and , while there is more of this kind of buying done in the unlisted utilities , the listed group has its features in American Water Works &; Electric and West Penn Co. which it owns . The former sold from a low of 10 to 117% in n relatively short time . The net of all this activity is to lift the average price of 20 industrials used in the Dow-Jones averages from 88.8:i on May 20 until , on August 2 , it was at 102.89 , the highest so far in 1921 . From May 20. when it stood at 81.17. average price of 20 railroads moved to a new 19241 high of 90.41 on July 2G . Meanwhile , public response to the brighter business and political outlook , foreshadowed by stock prices , is increasing and while pools may said to be still the potent factors in the activity and advance , public participation now forms a considerable part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
