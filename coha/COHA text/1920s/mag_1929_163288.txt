Ever since President Roosevelt called the first Governors ' Conference at the White House in 1908 to discuss protection of national resources , state executives have been meeting periodically to discuss their executive duties , to eschew all controversial matters , to have a sociable time . This year 's Conference , held last week by 22 Governors assembled in New London , Conn. , bubbled with unusual excitement when Gov . Franklin Delano Roosevelt of New York injected into it a letter on Prohibition which he had obtained from no less a personage than George Woodward Wickersham , chairman of President Hoover 's National Commission on Law Enforcement and Observance . <P> When they assembled , their agenda looked politically nonexplosive . Gov . Roosevelt of New York was down for a talk on " Cooperation of Governors on Crime Problems . " Maine 's Gov . William Tudor Gardiner was to speak on " Employment of Prisoners , " Carolina 's Gov . Oliver Max Gardner on " Youthful Prisoners , " Virginia 's Gov . Harry Flood Byrd on " The Segregation Plan of Taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " The Gasoline Tax . " It looked like poor pickings for newsmen assigned to cover the conference . <P> Gov . Roosevelt 's speech was tame until he quoted Commissioner Wickersham : <P> " Thus far the Federal Government has borne the brunt of Dry enforcement . It seems to me the Governors ' Conference might well consider approaching the Federal Government on some feasible proposal to share this burden . If the National Government were to attend to preventing importation , manufacture and shipment in interstate commerce of intoxicants , the State undertaking the internal police regulations to prevent sales , saloons , speakeasies and so forth , national and state , laws might be modified so as to become reasonably enforceable and one great source of demoralizing and pecuniarily profitable crime removed . . . . " <P> The significance of this proposal lay in the fact that until then the Hoover Law Enforcement Commission had studiously avoided specific mention of Prohibition as a crime problem . How did Gov . Roosevelt get such a message ? Was it meant for public use ? Gov . Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some ideas . Responding in longhand from Bar Harbor , Me. , Mr. Wickersham had explained : " I have no stenographer with me but I feel that your letter calls for the most helpful reply I can give and I hope that what I have written may suggest something of value in preparation of your address . " Gov . Roosevelt said he felt no restriction had been imposed against the letter 's publication . In Washington Chairman Wickersham refused to see newsmen , to answer their questions of whether or not he intended his letter for publication . <P> Thick and fast flew the questions at New London . Was Commissioner Wickersham demanding that all States give more material assistance to the U. S. on enforcement ? Or did he hint at local option , with each State free to deal with Prohibition as local sentiment dictated ? The words " modify " and " reasonably enforcible " caused Dry Governors to bristle with hostility . <P> West Virginia 's Conley said : " We do n't need modification . " <P> Utah 's Dern : " Logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
