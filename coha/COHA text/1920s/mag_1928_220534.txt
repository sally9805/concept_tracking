The first real outpopping of honest , controversial opinion , at the Sixth Pan-American Conference , came last week , in Havana , as the delegates were about to adjourn their stale and stuffy sittings . <P> Rotund and glossy Argentine Delegate Honorio Pueyrredon was first to potently outpop . His vastly rich and extensively land owning family enable him to flout whom he will with impunity . At the first session of the Assembly of the League of Nations , in Geneva , he arose and stalked out when Argentine interests seemed threatened . He stands high in the ranks of the strong , opposition , " Radical " party of Argentina . He has maintained himself as Ambassador at Washington by sheer prestige and almost in despite of Argentine President Marcelo de Alvear . <P> Since the opening of the present Conference , Seiior Pueyrredon has unalterably insisted it should make some definite pronouncement against high tariff barriers-that is to say , against high U. S. tariffs . By hard , driving diplomacy he got such a pronouncement tentatively recognized for insertion into the preamble of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. pressure resulted in the striking out of Pueyr-redon 's preamble clause . From Buenos Aires came , allegedly , instructions that he should knuckle under and sign the treaty draft . <P> Seiior Pueyrredon 's action was a Rooseveltian gesture . At one stroke he resigned as head of the Argentine Delegation and as Ambassador to Washington . <P> Soon in Buenos Aires , Foreign Minister <P> Dr. Angel Gallardo expressed his " amazement , " and President de Alvear openly flayed Senor Pueyrredon for " such conduct . " Both knew that with an Argentine presidential election scheduled for this spring , Senor Pueyrredon had made the grandest of grandstand plays to convince the electorate that he alone is of sufficiently tough presidential timber to stand up for Argentina , even against the U. S. With Outpopper Pueyrredon thus self-eliminated , the treaty reorganizing the Pan-American Union was submitted in innocuous form to the plenary session of the Conference . <P> Three resolutions condemning various phases of immigration restriction were adopted by the Conference in plenary session , last week . After each was read out , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Ambassador to Italy , rose and announced that the U. S. reserves to itself the right of determining its own " purely domestic " immigration policy without reference to any international authority whatever . <P> Final and titanic outpopping occurred on the eve of adjournment , last week , when Foreign Minister of Salvador Dr. Don Jose Gustavo Guerrero broke an agreement arrived at in committee not to present to the plenary session a resolution condemning intervention-such as that of the U. S. in Nicaragua . <P> When the delegates had assembled for a routine plenary session , Dr. Guerrero suddenly leaped to his feet and moved a resolution as follows : " Resolved : That no state shall intervene in the internal affairs of another . "
