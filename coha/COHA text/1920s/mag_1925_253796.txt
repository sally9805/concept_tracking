Small things huddle together in bundles , herds , packages ; the great walk lonely . It is strange to see a school of whales , a troop of tigers ; stranger still to see a congress of pianos . Yet , on the r.tage of the Metropolitan Opera House , Manhattan , were marshaled 18 of these great , suave , sable instruments , in neat rows . Most remarkable of all-before each sat a famed player , before each a face which alone might have been enough to bring to the hall the notable company that filled it on that evening . The company had assembled , the pianos trundled into line , all to get money for the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor . Walter Damrosch* , famed conductor , waved his baton ; the thunderous regiment as one voice responded . <P> Thus were the 18 famed players ranked with their 18 pianos : <P> Left row-Guy Maier , Krnest Schelling , Lee Pattison , Sigismund Stojowski and Guiomar Novas . <P> Left center-Josef Lhvinne , Alexander Brailowsky , Ethel Leginska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Harold Bauer , Germaine Schnitzer and Yolanda Mro . <P> Right-Mischa Levitzki , Karl Friedberg , Ernest Hutcheson , Alexander Siloti and Elly Ney . <P> Eyeing the hand of Conductor Damrosch , the entire congress began to play , with sonorous tutti , Saint-Saens ' Variations on a Theme by Beethoven . Then Mines . Hess , Leginska and Mr sat jowl to jowl at one piano , played Boieldieu 's overture to La Dame Blanche . Laughter and applause . Mr. Brailowsky opened the preamble of Schummann 's Carnaval , passed it on to Mr. Gabrilowitch , and so the music leaped from instrument to instrument " till all marched against the Philistines . " <P> This mountebankery over , Dwight W. Morrow , Chairman of the Association and famed J. P. Morgan partner , rose . There was something to be done , he said . The Knabe-Ampico Piano Co. had given a piano to be auctioned off . Who would beat the gavel ? " Oh , there you are ! " said Mr. Morrow , spying Joseph P. Day , famed amateur auctioneer . Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he . " Who 'll give me two thousand ? " <P> " Two thousand , " yelled a voice . <P> " Piker ! " said Mr. Day , " Come higher ! " <P> " Three thousand , " yelled a voice . <P> " Who 's going to bid for this piano ? " asked Mr. Day . <P> Doctors , lawyers , merchant chiefs-they were going to bid for the piano . Cunningly , Mr. Day conducted an orchestra of instruments subtler than those of Mr. Damrosch 's . Up and up went the bidders . At last only three were left : William C. Potter , President of the Guaranty Trust Co. ; Charles E. Mitchell , President of the National City Bank ; Thomas Cochran , of J. P. Morgan &; Co . <P> " Twenty-one thousand nine hundred dollars , " said Mr. Mitchell . <P> " Who 'll give me twenty-two ? " asked Mr. Day . <P> " I , " said Mr. Cochran . <P> " Sold ! " said Mr. Day . <P> Thus hearty Mr. Cochran , generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to own the piano . Immediately he presented it to the Association . Then the 18 artists played We Wo n't Go Home Till Morning . They improvised chopsticks ; the tune was recorded on a player-piano role , auctioned by Mr. Damrosch to Cornelius N. Bliss for $2,000 . <P>
