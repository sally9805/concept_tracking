Vienna , the Gay-Vienna , rival of Paris , was last week preparing joyfully to revive its famed Redouten Bal , its opera ball , after four years of " interruption . " Its committee was resolved it should miss no facets of the sparkle of days before the War . The entire building of the Opera House was last week in readiness for dancers , whom five famed orchestras , no less , were to serve . With faith in her charms , Vienna invited the wealth and beauty of Europe to attend . <P> As distinguished prelude to this gayety , there occurred the Vienna premire of Intermezzo , newest opera by Richard Strauss . He , its composer , has lately been unkind to Vienna . Only last month , he refused to conduct the Viennese Opera unless the government granted him a huge salary , complete autocratic powers , a once royal palace for the duration of his life-this at a time when the Viennese are living on rations . But Vienna could not do without him . He alone could be the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always prophesied speedy neglect for Richard Strauss , * now 62 , and have simultaneously hailed him again and once more the foremost living composer . The subject of their judgment may be an old man , his apogee undoubtedly passed . But the creations of Richard Strauss , are never treated casually , for his work is intensely personal and his personality is provoking . Looking upon the philosophical brow , dreamy eyes , sensitive lips , effeminate chin , one marvels how this musician can grate so on the world . There is his mercenariness . Once he invited notables from all parts of Europe to a supper given after the premiere of his ballet La Legende de Joseph , then served upon each guest a bill for his share of the food . There is his snobbish insincerity : " I have always said my work was superficial . " Many people will never forgive him for the satirical hoaxes of program music composed specially to test how much cacophony , dissonance , exaggeration , clowning the dilettante audiences would applaud , the grave critics would ponder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recall his wife 's remark : " You may say what you like about his music , but if you do n't praise his handwriting he will be cross with you . " Many of these people curl the lip , reflect with Hugo Riesmann : " His last works only too clearly reveal his determination to make a sensation at all costs . "
