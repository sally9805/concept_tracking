Henry Ford watched pensively , last week , while a line of motor cars no bigger than bathtubs moved briskly toward completion in the huge , humming plant of Morris Motors Ltd. , at Cowley , England . <P> Because there is a crushing British tax on engines of Ford dimensions , the tiny and lightly taxed Morris-Cowleys are bought in preference to Fords by thrifty Britons . <P> Through minute after minute Henry Ford watched the swift , straight , line of bathtub-cars with a fascinated gaze . " You <P> English , " he observed at last , " are further ahead here than most Americans realize . " Formal entertainment proffered last week to the visiting Motor Man ( TIME , April 16 , 23 ) included a luncheon given by David Lloyd George in the Members ' Restaurant of the House of Commons . " My goodness ! " said Mr. Ford , later , of Mr. George , " how that man can ask questions about America ! "               @ @ @ @ @ @
