" I saw myself in 1906 again , driving Paddy from store to store , doing my level best to sell Cheese . The heartbreaks and disappointments all came back and were just as real as if they were just happening . Over again I ate my ten cent breakfast of coffee and rolls , and quietly slipped one into my pocket for lunch . I remembered the summer underwear and low shoes that I wore during that cold winter of 1907 ... the past when the Kraft Company was small and everybody called everybody else by his first name-even the stenographers . . . . " <P> This glimpse into the early life of the president of his company would have been afforded a stockholder of Kraft Cheese Co. who in 1925 read an article entitled , " A Cheese Business for the Ages , " written by James Louis Kraft and printed in the monthly Kraft house-organ , Cheesekraft . If the stockholder had read further , past a reference to " dear old aunt Beckey . She has gone to her reward , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future : " I do not suppose anyone else ever planned a cheese business to live through the ages . . . after we are gone , there will be Kraft salesmen trekking the veldt of Africa , braving the snows of Siberia and battling the superstitions of Mongolia-all earnestly striving to increase sales , which by that time will be far in excess of a hundred million . " <P> Yet , however true were these predictions , there have happened since 1925 events that even visionary President Kraft could not have foreseen . In 1928 Kraft Cheese Co. acquired Phenix Cheese Corp. , changed its name to Kraft-Phenix Cheese Co. , became dominant in the U. S. More companies have been added constantly . Late this summer it became known that control of Kraft-Phenix had passed to Selected Industries , Inc. , and affiliated investment groups . But bigger than any of these developments was an announcement last week that Kraft-Phenix would be a unit in a new food company sponsored by the National City Bank . Other companies included were Hershey Chocolate Corp . and Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new company ahead of J. P. Morgan 's Standard Brands , Inc . <P> In many ways the new holding company will resemble Standard Brands , which retains the identity of its units but profits through economy in distribution . Chief unit of Standard Brands was Fleish-mann Yeast Co. with a highly specialized , rapid system of distribution famed in fact and romance . Another was nationally sold Royal Baking Powder . To the new company Kraft-Phenix Cheese Corp . brings an international distribution system that embraces food stores , while the marketing systems of Hershey and Colgate include candy and drug stores . With this nucleus other companies can be added , swiftly expanded .
