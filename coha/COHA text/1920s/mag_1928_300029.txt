" I propose the fig leaf as your emblem , gentlemen ! Honor it as the origin of your great Merchant Tailors ' Federation . When the Garden of Eden crisis occurred , Eve took the only available fig leaf , and Adam had to clothe himself in heavy skins . <P> " In our present day of grace , Eve has returned to her old principle of the scant fig leaf , but Adam still clothes himself heavily and laboriously . . . I suggest more color in Adam 's clothes . . . . May we live to see a scarlet morning coat worn with fig-leaf-green trousers and a canary waistcoat ! " <P> To convivial Merchant Tailors , banqueting in London last week , it seemed that the above words were actually uttered by Guest-of-Honor Sir Nicholas Gratten-Doyle , M. P. , and Director of Northern Newspapers Co. , Ltd . But friends of Sir William doubted . They knew that he knows his Bible . Therefore it seemed impossible that he could have so thoroughly scrambled the Genesis story of the fig leaves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself in " the only available fig leaf . " There were plenty . For ( Genesis III , 7 ) " they Adam and Eve sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons . " <P> Adam was apparently quite as satisfied with his scanty apron as Eve ; but the Lord God was not . Therefore ( Genesis III , 21 ) " unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothed them . " <P> Pious Merchant Tailors should honor no more fig leaf or apron of fig leaves , but rather the Lord God , as the true originator of their ancient profession .
