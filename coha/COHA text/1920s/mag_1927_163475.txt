The Idea : Modern life reflected in dress silks . <P> The Motive : To create a vogue for odd materials . <P> The Story : Designers last week exhibited in Manhattan ( at the Art Centre show ) silk dress fabric taking as motifs jazz bands , Fifth Avenue crowds , ticker tape , rollercoasters , etc . In similar designs are printed linens and other fabrics for drawing-room hangings . Graphic art is represented in the work of F. V. Carpenter . He has designed a pattern portraying Manhattan 's shopping district with its pedestrians &; automobiles . Other designers have used toboggan slides and umbrellas , massed lines , moving lines of busses and cars . Artist John Held Jr . has done a jazz band-round bald heads , heads with sparse hair , their owners blowing saxophones or beating drums . Sil-houet prints contrast the curves of a roller-coaster runway with the straight lines of tall supports . The emphasis in the toboggan cars suggests a pattern of the Orient rather than Coney Island . So called " message prints " ( letters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell out such words as " It , " " Cheerio " &; " Je t'aime . " Ticker tape on a black background careless of space and balance meets the requirements of graphic design . " April " in the modern sense is the view of struggling humanity from a 21-story skyscraper.
