Among the difficulties they are facing is the tendency of specialists to monopolize prestige and large fees .

" " There are people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report , " ls doomed ; that he will disappear because he can not compete with ' the specialist on the one hand and with preventive and social medicine on the other . Points to Doctors ' Value . " Such an outcome is to be viewed with concern . The well-trained , properly equipped , experienced general practitioner of ability , character and personality is a fundamentally valuable person . He is a good diagnostician . He sees his patient as a whole . He knows his peculiarities and circumstances . He can decide when to refer him to a specialist sad when to protect him against the very real clanger which is threatened by a narrowly specialist point of view . He , cheers and encourages , warns and commands . He is not only a physician but ' a friend and counselor . The disappearance of the general practitioner would be a serious loss . The stimulating philosophy of individualism with . its insistence upon independence , initiative and ambition seems to be embodied in the general practitioner . " He will survive only if he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to meet the new conditions . He will have to submit to a measure of team work in the use of laboratories and other resources ; lie will be compelled , to recognize tile public demand tor sharing costs of sickness and , most important of all , he must become a practitioner of preventive medicine , a counselor of health , a man who can recognize and correct the minor but remediable physical and mental detects which are so common . ' This will mean an increasing preoccupation with the normal and a Knowledge of the effects upon health of diet , exercise , mental attitudes , recreation and family and social life . To train men and women for this reinterpreted and redirected function - the medical schools will be compelled radically to modify their aims and methods and to ' Permeate the curriculum with the preventive idea .
