txt The woman under 30 is not- often deeply concerned about lines in her face . Unless she has been a victim of ill health , or has victimized herself with dissipations of one sort or another , she has n't much right to be concerned , except perhaps for those fine little imprints around the outer edges of the eyes . These she may have brought on by taking life with a laugh , which is n't a bad way to take it , you 'll admit . If that 's her nature she wo n't worry much about those lines , either . But 30 has a way of coming around , no matter how you try to laugh it off . And before you know it , the skin begins to lose considerable of that fresh charm of earlier days . Incipient lines at first , maybe , but give them a few more falls and winters and what have you but a harder job ahead to iron them out than if you 'd begun preventive work earlier ? Those laughing lines around the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's feet , and the mouth corners have shadows that are suspiciously ageing . and under the chin , maybe , is an Indian summer crease . Personally , . I do n't think a face without a passing dent or two of time worth the cold cream you use to cleanse it with . You 'd have to be an imbecile , or a moron , at least , to have lived some thirty odd years without some story written in your face . No one really should want to look like a dunimy , any more than she should want to be one . On the other hand , neither do you want to look in these full-bloom years as if life had used you for a football , or you 'd let yourself be used so . Tha trick is not , in my opinion , to look what you were at 16 , but to hang on to that period of ripe maturity as long as you can . That is why 30 , because of the lines and wrinkles that follow closely on its heels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armor and fight with skin foods , massages , and the ' correction of bad facial habits . If you catch these more or less in. cipient marks of time when they are young and pliable you 've got them under control , at least . Arid that is about all we can ask from a well spent life . Watch for them in the order of their appearance  --  crow 's feet , lines around the mouth and the deep creases at each side of the nose . Mold and pat these special areas with cream for five minutes night and morning , alwayil with an upward and outward motion . And keep an eye on the chin line , for every neglectful year after 30 takes its toll unmercifully there . BEAUTY ANSWERS MRS . H. P.
