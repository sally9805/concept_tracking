txt In a statement declaring that the investigation into the bonding business of Sinnott &; Canty was part of a conspiracy on the part of " the traction and public utility groups " to drive him out of office , Mayor Hylan denied yesterday that he had had any knowledge of the eighty-six messages sent from his office to the Sinnott bonding firm , a list of which was made public on Saturday by Deputy Controller Charles F. Kerrigan . The Mayor declared that the scheme of his enemies was to undermine his health , attack and besmirch him , to reach into his home by sending his wife batches of newspaper clippings attacking him and to create fear among members of his family not only for his health but fqr his life . The Mayor added that he would go on " regardless of the mountains of calumny and abuse " against him . " My only hope , " he Said . " is that those nearest and dearest to me may not be affected by the most contemptible and cowardly warfare against a public official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . " Mayor Hylan did not dispute the authenticity of the slips showing that the cost . of the special messenger service from his office to the office of Sinnott &; Canty had been charged to the city . He declared that it was the duty of Controller Craig , if he had any doubt about the city 's liability , to refuse to pay the bills and to notify him . The majority of the slips were marked with the initials . " J. F. S. , " presumably those of John F. Sinnott , the Mayor 's secretary and son-in-law , arid brother of J. Paul Sinnott , head of Sinnott &; Canty . Although neither Controller Craig nor Deputy Controller Kerrigan would comment for publication on the Mayor 's statentent , it was learned that the Controller ' had stopped payment on the- slips as soon as he noticed that the number of messages indicated a steady flow of communications between the Mayor 's office and the Sinnott firm . It was said that the head of the special messenger firm called last Fall at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid , and that soon after this the charge to the city stopped for any messages from the Mayor 's office to Sinnott &; Canty , if messages continued to be sent . Quoting Corporation Counsel George P. Nicholson to support his contention , Mayor Hylan declared that Controller Craig should have rejected any bond offered if he had any evidence of favoritism or fraud in the procurement of the bond by the broker handling it . ' and should have notified the District Attorney of any violation of law . Mayor Hyian 's Statement . The Mayor 's statement follows : " Some real facts would have been given to the public regarding the bonding of contractors and the absolute freedom of connection therewith of the Mayor and his office if the newspapers had given adequate space to the letter which the Corporation Counsel wrote to me yesterday . " In that letter the Corporation Counsel pointed out that the Controller has run power to reject the security of any contractor if there has been any irregularity in the letting of the contract or the procuring of the bond of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance of the contract made it obligatory upon the part of the Controller to stop the payments of the peo- I ple 's money to contrateots . " It was also pointed out that any evigience of favoritism or fraud in the procurement of a bond by the broker handling the surety business vested the Controller with the duty to reject the bond proferred . The Controller was also I required to bring to the attention of the District Attorney any violations of the penal law in connection therewith . " The Corperation Counsel further stated that every bond given for the faithful performance of each of the thousands of contracts entered into with the city received the approval of the Controller and that therefore it must be presumed that there was no evidence of wrongdoing . but that if there were and the Controller failed to take appropriate action the responsibility for any untoward consequences must be borne by the Controller and by him alone . Secret Investigation Attacked . " The further point is made by Corporation Counsel Nicholson that the firm of Sinnott &; Canty is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Jurisdiction of the State Superintendent of Insurance and that their brokerage rates are identical , but that the Controller persists In giving an ugly appearance to the situation by his conducting , through his deputy , Kerrigan , of an investigation behind closed doors and the feeding to the press and the public of doctored and distorted statements . carrying imputations of wrongdoing when none in fact do exist , have existed or will exist so long as I am in the Mayor 's office . " As bearing upon the attitude of the newspapers in this Sinnott-Canty matter , I notice that those newspapers , which have bitterly opposed the policies of my administration , have again given front page space to another misleading statement issued by Craig 's deputy , Kerrigan . " Kerrigan 's latest political statement is intended to convey the impression that for three years certain messages between the Mayo 's office and the firm of Sinnott &; Canty , transmitted through a private messenger service , were paid for by the city , and that such messages had something to do with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of such messages . Never did I authorize the sending of a single one of such messages , even if they ' were Gent as alleged by Kerrigan . Bays Craig Has Not Complained . " I have repeatedly told Contrpller Craig that he should direct my attention to any charge to an appropriation of the Mayor 's office or any of the Mayor 's departments about which he entertained the slightest doubt as to regularity or propriety . At no time has the Controller called my attention to any budget charge which in his opinion was not entirely Proper . " If a single one of the alleged roeslieges referred to was not an appropriate charge , it should not have been paid by the Controller . If they were wrong three years ago , nobody heard a word about them from the Controller . Where was Craig ? " Perhaps he was too busy paying out over two million dollars in settlement of claims a contractors . one of which claims was for 3423,000 and all of which Payments he made without consulting with the members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the people 's money Means in these instances a three point raise in the tax rate . The Commissioner of Accounts is looking into these millions of disbursements of the people 's money while Craig spends his time looking : Tito the 30-cent disbursements which his deputy does not charge were not of an official nature . " There is one thing which the people of this city may be certain of , namely , that the fake investigation of Deputy Controller Kerrigan into trivial matters having no relationship to the official conduct of my office , and despite the sinister attempts of Kerrigan to impute a relationship , will not deter the Commissioner of Accounts from bringing out the facts of the relation of the Controller 's office with contractors and especially the payment by Controller Craig or over two million dollars to contractors in settlement of claims without consultation with the members of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment . " The traction and public utility groups , which have had seven lean years , are determined to get a new set of public officials who will let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hope to seize . They will stop at nothing to accomplish this purpose . They will use anybody who will stoop to their designs , in and out of official circles . Objects to Dragging In Mrs. Hylan . " The meanest and most petty annoyances to which I am being subjected are all a part of this traction-public utility campaign to drive me out of the Mayor 's office . The scheme is to undermine my health , to attack and besmirch me as no man has ever been attackea and besmirched , to reach into my home with their filthy fingers by sending to Mrs. Hylan daily batches of clippings from the newspapers which attack me , and to create a fear among the members of my family not alone for my health but for the safety of my very life .

I shall continue to employ for the best interests of the people the facilities which God has given me . I shall continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imputations os wrong made by money-mad individuals and corporations and , given the widest currency . by newspapers sympathetic to them , of every humane and progressive activity of the City Administration .
