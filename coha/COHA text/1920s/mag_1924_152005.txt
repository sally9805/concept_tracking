Cornell 's high-powered , underslung applecart had , up to last week , trundled through three seasons and two games without lurching . Then along came Williams-in particular Left End Ide of Williams . The Big Red applecart took a lurch , a swerve , a jolt on the thank-you-ma 'm , and lumbered off the road 7 to 14 . Ide , scion of Troy , N. Y. , collar-makers , scored both Williams ' touchdowns , one by whisking up a fumble , one by fastening on a pass . Cornell , fast and brawny , fumbled five times ; Williams , fast and brainy , worked smoothly . <P> At Annapolis , another capsizing occurred . Marquette cruised all the way from Milwaukee and blew the Navy out of water , 21 to 3 . Navy led until the second half , when the Milwaukeans took turns scampering to the Navy goal . Skemp scampered 45 yards , McCormick 65 , Dilweg 75 . <P> Princeton had little joy of her guests from Lehigh . Large fellows , they kept their goal line inaccessible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped out of bounds on a longish run . The scoreless tie made it obvious that Princeton could neither drop-kick nor punt . <P> Had it occurred to Quarterback Moore of Georgia to drop-kick from the 17-yard line in the last period , Yale might not have squeaked through 7 to 6 . But Moore forgot or disdained or just did not know . He passed , was beaten . The Georgia running attack was superb . For Yale , Halfback Cottle passed , plowed , scored . <P> Harvard 's game with Middlebury was reminiscent of the 6-to-6 tie that stuck in the Crimson craw last year . Captain Klevenow , of the Vermonters , missed his try for goal , however , and Rogers and Gherke gathered belated points for Harvard . Score : Harvard , 16 ; Middlebury , 6 . <P> During Dartmouth 's 38-to-0 seige upon Vermont , Halfback Oberlander transported the ball for a total of 200 yards , scored four of six touchdowns . When he runs , Oberlander puts 197 pounds in rapid motion . <P> Syracuse roughed and tumbled about with William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the services of Halfback Bowman , the fleet " Chet " Bowman who ran for the U. S. in Colombes Stadium last July . Tackled violently , Bowman left the field " indefinitely , " his neck and shoulders damaged . <P> From behind a forward wall which clicked into side formations at a signal , Chicago smashed and smashed at Brown , rammed home 19 points to 7 with straight football . A blocked kick led to Brown 's score , but a flight of passes failed to add to it . This was the first " big intersectional game . " <P> In the one Western Conference game of the week , Ohio State and Iowa spent an afternoon bunting , barging , bucking , kicking , passing-and the score was 0-0 . Michigan University and the Michigan Aggies seemed about to come to a like concluson when , as dusk came down , a 33-yard pass shot into Aggie territory , a Michigan end touched down . <P> Illinois pulled herself together and swamped Butler 40 to 10 , Halfback McIlwain looking almost the man his captain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored 12 points . <P> Northwestern and her lusty Ralph Baker took 42 points from Cincinnati . <P> On the Pacific Coast , where football championships are celebrated by burning up great pyramids of pine trees , California set about her season by letting Pomona off at 28 to 0 .
