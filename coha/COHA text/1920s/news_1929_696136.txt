txt THE Timas editorial , " New York Farmers , " has been read with considerable interest . I gather that you and our New York neighbors are in a quandary as to why our Kansas and Iowa friends do most of the wailing , in view of the attention you have called to the Empire State as no mean agricultural territory . It is also with interest to note that you city folks can not bring yourselves to believe that farmers " grow " milk and apples . I believe it would be a great service to the country if city folks took a course in the rudiments of farming and that farmers received instruction in the trials and costs of manufacture . Were there a better understanding of each other 's problems , there would be less need to stimulate each industry artificially . The average New York housewife and her husband are agreed that we country fellows " blackjack " them when they are called upon to pay 40 to 50 cents for prime beefsteak out of 14 to 15 cent live cattle ; also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 60 cents per dozen for choice white eggs , depending on the season . Of course , the housewife does not know that a steer is not all steak and that the average beef animal yields only about 50 per cent meat . On the other hand , farmers in all parts of the country wonder why shoes cost $5 a pair and a suit costs $20 , when both have so little raw material in them . Farmers do grow milk and do grow apples . To get the former , cows must be grown . One can not very well grow cows without growing a suitable feed crop , unless we come to the point where we can obtain milk from the milk tree ; but that , too , would have to be cultivated . The milk tree , if it could be transplanted to our climes , would probably solve the distribution cost , for each city worker who resides in the suburbs could produce his own milk by planting a few of these trees , thereby serving a twofold purpose -- beautifying the home and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pasteurization , bottle , labor , and delivery costs . The city dweller could get like benefits by planting these milk trees on the roof of the apartment , or it could be made a block community project . If Congress would pass legislation to create a few New Yorks in the midst of Iowa and Kansas , so that our friends there could load up their Fords with spinach , celery , sweet corn , chickens , eggs , flowers , asparagus , &c.,; market these products and be back on the farm the same day , it is quite likely that Iowa and Kansas would not wail so much . It would be efficiency to the nth degree to move the population to the midst of cattle and grain producing sections . But until that is done we shall need railroads and farmers in Iowa and Kansas to raise the grain crops , while the farmer in the centre of populous sections can very well practice crop diversification . Being in the midst of an agricultural section , we have opportunity to see farm problems as they actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 18 , 1929.
