TWO great authors were unusually active last week . Rudyard Kipling produced a poem which was printed on the front page of the Times , and which read as if it were a poem written by a press agent for John D. Rockefeller , Sr. , while A. Conan Doyle published in Liberty a " Sherlock HoImes " story which opened with a lump of negro dialect so bad as to be a scream . These authors have our sympathy in their brave struggle to continue great though famous . WE CAN NOT help congratulat- ing Mr. John Wanamaker on having got out an Apartment Rental Guide covering the Washington Square , Greenwich Village , Chelsea , and Gramercy Park districts . The fact that Mr. Wanamaker is doing this in order to advertise his store does not make his service any the less endearing . Vacant apartments are listed according to both location and price , and we believe that , were we thinking of moving , we would honor Mr. Wanamaker by using his pretty booklet . Unfortunately for the big store , however , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dire are the equinoctial storms that sweep the open-air back gardens of Greenwich Village tea rooms at this season . Nothing is quite so wet , quite so disintegrated , as a minor poet eating Salisbury steak in a heavy rain . Very , very hungry minor poets , we are told , have been known to quit the garden at the first downpour , take a table inside , and try to look like a newly arrived guest , in hope the waitress will start in with soup again . IN ORDER that The Public may not be confused during the painful adjustments of back-to-normalcy after saving daylight all summer , we wish to add our word of warning to that of the time tables and other literature en the subject . On Sunday , or preferably Monday , an extra hour of sleep may be had by all  --  that hour which was unaccountably lost last spring . For at least one , we must confess that we have saved no daylight whatever during all these months . There are always , however , the thrifty few , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at four per cent , in various banks about town for the sundry rainy days that will soon be upon us . And we shall doubtless have to be one of the borrowers at six or eight per cent by January . ' THERE may be something sound - I-  in the agitation to prohibit the throwing of paper out of the windows at celebrities , but we disagree . We ca n't see why the people of this city have n't the right to throw waste paper at whoever they think deserves it . Some assert that it is all right to act thus toward Trudy , but that it would never do for the Queen of Rumania . This is piffle . As a matter of fact America has no greater honor to give than the Salute of the Wastebasket . The key to the city is a formal and an empty honor . The Salute of the Wastebasket is a very real tribute . If the coming Queen does not recognize this she is not so intelligent as her pictures in advertisements make her out to be . FURTHERMORE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about the only spontaneous expression of emotion in which we sad and inhibited inhabitants of this town dare indulge . The cop is always on the corner waiting to arrest any one who forms a crowd . We are afraid to sing , dance , drink , make merry , or make love in the streets we own . Let us at least throw paper at princes . On with . the Ball WITH the fall influx of travelers and its consequent hotel rush , a recent bridegroom has related his most disconcerting experience . Returning to the city with his wife , he betook himself to one of New York 's largest and most fashionable hotels . He had wired for accommodations . To the young man 's discomfiture the hotel management had failed to receive his wire . No room would be available until morning . Meanwhile , it being already midnight , the tired travelers insisted emphatically that the hotel provide temporary quarters . " We have only the ballroom , " explained a desperate clerk , " but a bed could be put up there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There in the very middle of the floor , just beneath the magnificent and brilliantly lighted crystal chandelier had been placed a bed . Feeling about as secluded as they would have felt in the middle of Times Square , the unhappy pair forthwith donned their raiments de ? mit . " Now , dear , " suggested the wife , " put out the light " Whereupon began a fruitless search for the button to extinguish the crystal chandelier . Sallying pajama-clad into the hall , the frantic husband hailed a passing waiter . Would he put out the light ? " Sorry , sir , " explained the waiter , " but the same switch controls your chandelier and the one in the banquet hall next door . And it just happens there 's a stag dinner on there tonight " Miserably , in floods of brightest light , husband and wife climbed into bed , after first opening the great French window to let in some air . This last move , however , proved most unfortunate , for the sudden fierce draught from outdoors blew open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing to the latter 's some fifty merry stags a wild-eyed young couple brilliantly illuminated in their bed in the middle of a ballroom . ? A GENTLEMAN was describing 1- one of those very modern young ladies whose habit it is to adjust their garters in public , displaying the while an engaging glimpse of their undies . " Ah , " murmured Mr. David H. Wallace , " her mentionables . " Buzz-Buzz " THERE are always plenty of things which need explaining by the telephone company , and of late the buzz-buzz and the soft voice of one operator calling " Right ! " to her mate when you give a number has been one of them . The telephone official who explained the phenomenon to us prefaced his remarks with the cheering news that no one outside the telephone company could understand it . We pass this news on for what it is worth . In the old days of last spring , when a Bryant ( or any other non-dial ) operator was asked for Rector ( or any other non-dial ) number , she pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rector then spoke to her and told her which lines were open between the exchanges . The Bryant then connected her party with the Rector , who completed the call . This is simple to understand but was clumsy in operation and was discarded . What happens now beggars description . Lucidly , the buzz-buzz is the cry of the automatic machine connect-Mg Bryant and Rector without the preliminary conversation we outlined above . The " Right ! " is the cry of the Rector assuring the Bryant that she is on hand and that all is set for the giving of the number . In short , Bryant , instead of having to ask Rector which line to use , now puts in a plug , hears the cry of " Right ! " and gives her number , the selection of lines being automatic . Smoker 's Seat N THIS day it sounds incredible , I but in Helen Woodward 's book , " Through Many Windows , " is a story of a fa mcais woman author who was engaged as editor-in-chief of one of the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ten minutes because she insisted that she could n't work without smoking cigarettes , and because her predecessor , one of the owners of the magazine , could not allow such a pernicious practice in the editorial sanctum . Miss Woodward tells the story anonymously , but it seems that the author in question is Mary Roberts Rinehart , the magazine the Ladies ' Home Journal and the former editor Mr. Edward Bok . So near , apparently , did Mrs. Rinehart come to being an editor and giving up her writing . We recall that as recently as ten years ago a lady of our acquaintance was told by the headwaiter that she could not smoke in the dining room  --  a quaint bit of history . Hit THE USUAL romantic tale atitaches to the adventures of " Broadway " before it became , quite suddenly and unheralded , this season 's first " smash . " Its original author , Philip Dunning , bumming around in cabarets , on the Coast , here in town , had sent it on the conventional rounds of producers and brokers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the Shuberts included ; and even Jed Harris , the man who has finally produced it , was offered the manuscript a year ago but neglected an opportunity to read it . When it reappeared in a bunch of manuscripts sent him from a play broker recently , he glanced at it casually , caught the line toward the bottom of the first page of manuscript , " Enter waiter with a funny walk , " and promptly put it on the bottom of the pile . However , he eventually did read it again and decided to persuade the budding playwright to collaborate with a more experienced technician . Donning agreed , which explains George Abbott 's name on the bill . Meantime Dunning has become stage manager of " Sunny " and divides his time between being excited over his sudden success as a playwright and being worried over a new girl of doubtful value in the cast of the musical comedy . Incidentally , Abbott , his collaborator , is also said to have had a hand in the making of another Broadway hit with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said to have been kept in a top drawer of a bureau for three years until the horoscope of its authors showed the stars to be propitiously disposed toward its production . ? AMONG THE ARCHAIC signs on the island are those which announce : " Public Hack Stand . " They would probably be Greek to the younger generation were it not for the sub-captions : " Two Cabs ( Horse ) and Two Taxicabs . " And there , in front of these signs , stand two taxicabs but no horse cabs . And yet , four taxis are not allowed  --  so far . Further Report NOW that more than just a few New Yorkers have been at the Sesquicentennial , what with the lure of the Dempsey-Tunney fight , our report is more complete than it has been for some months . It appears that the exposition is at last in full operation , albeit feebly . Almost everything is finally the way it was supposed to be in June , except for the Tower of Light , which is nothing but a steel structure with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it was intended to be properly clad in plaster and ornateness . A few foreign governments , a great many industrial concerns , Pennsylvania , and the United Stares have things on display . At night the buildings are lighted with red , pink , and blue lights  --  and the result is not as painful as it sounds . The Pittsburgh building is the most amusing to those who are interested in modern tendencies in architecture . Despite the fact that it looks like a prop in a German movie , it is the only thing which smacks of solid American 1926 stuff . It is a blessed relief from the imitation Italian campaniles and Greek temples . Except during the last days of fight excitement , the attendance has been small and most of the attractions on the " Gladway " have seemed empty , idle , and sad . But there is a terrifying roller coaster doing a fairly good business because of its super-thrill of a simultaneous precipitous descent and hairpin curve . People will pay to risk their lives . At the far end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot-dog sellers and amusement runners begin barking all along the line as soon as a single customer heave= in sight . Just what will eventually be done with the exposition , no one seems to know . The Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company may take it over . It may be run by the present organization for another year , although it is about three million dollars in debt . The city has reached its borrowing limit and the only way of helping is to divert money now held for subway construction . An example of the hard luck which has pursued its progress is cited in the magnificent pageant which was counted upon as an important feature , but which fell through . The spectacle was heavily insured against rain  --  if it rained before eight o'clock in the evening . It happened that it rained almost every time the pageant was scheduled , but always after eight , so that no insurance could be col-It cted . Testimonial ATOUCHING tribute to the tabloids has come to our attention in the form of a confession on the part of an amateur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were interested in music beyond jazz . Through the Lonely Hearts column in the Graphic he has found congenial companions , and now he never attends a classical concert alone . The next thing we hope to learn is that some zealous soul who has been able to pass ten consecutive examinations on " Are You a New Yorker ? " with an everage of 100 per cent , has found from the lonesome hearts column an equally adept man about town and that together they will retire to Chicago and conquer another world . Post-Mortem AFAINT echo from last week 's Radio Show has come to us from a fan who has always been loud in his insistence that every home should have a set and that there is always at least one thing on the air each evening worth listening to . It was the night of the Radio Industries Banquet and our friend was trying to tune in on something more diverting than a lecture by Vice President Dawes on the subject of reforming the Senate Rules . He had forgotten that on this epochal evening some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set normally reached , were in one gigantic hook-up . He had worked his dials all the way from VEAF 's number down practically to zero before he collapsed , a forlorn little heap , among the A-batteries . Tour de Luxe HAVING suddenly realized that he had not been West for fifteen years , Otto Kahn is off on an offseason tour and this time is making it as thorough as his undivided attention , two months of his time , and a scheduled itinerary in two private cars can make it . He has already reached the Pacific Coast by way of Toronto , Chicago , Denver , Salt Lake City , and Glacier National Park , and after another week or so on the Coast will go to the Grand Canyon , dip down into Mexico and return toward the end of October through Texas , Omaha , and St. Louis  --  a total of 11,708 miles . Roger Wolfe Kahn , his son , is also enjoying a brief vacation on the Coast rather unexpectedly . He told his mother he could n't take any time off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his obligation to keep them working in order to pay salaries . But Mrs. Kahn was not fazed . She is paying the musicians their full salaries ? $l 1,000 , it is said ? while Roger loafs for six weeks . THIS apparently indicates that the swimming season is over , since the Kahns have deserted the new pool in their Long Island home . It seems that the vapor which arises from this swimming pool is distressingly like the vapor which arises from other swimming pools , condensing especially on side walls of the stair well and forming muddy and unpleasant effects . Accordingly architects were called upon to remedy the situation , and the result was that a young artist named Austin Purves was commissioned to decorate the walls of the stair well with paintings on glass . After some months of labor on the part of Mr. Purves , the descent into Mr. Kahn 's pool is a descent to the bottom of the sea . Multitudes of gorgeous black , gold , silver , and blue fish , surrounded by a suitable coral and seaweed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As one descends the stair well , the water gets bluer and the types of fish change . Aided by Dr. Beebe and the living models in the Aquarium , Mr. Purees carefully relegated each fish to its proper level and habitat . The conger eels , for instance , are near the top , while the pompanos are swooping about near the door of the pool . A tender bit of piscatorial domesticity is pictured among the eels , incidentally , one of which is having its teeth cleaned by a four-eyes , a little dental fish that devotes its life to cleaning the mouths and teeth of larger fish . As the paintings are done on glass plates a few inches from the wall , they are astonishingly lifelike and the condensed vapor merely adds to the realistic effect . Thus does art triumph over nature . Dumb Waiter ALL who have eaten in restaurants will he interested in an occurence in a private dining room at one of our more elegant hostelries . The host at a small dinner party was annoyed with the service , which finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the kitchen , the management , the hotel , he swept the china and glassware and silver all into one glittering mass in the center of the table , then gathered them , with a loud clatter , into the virgin damask tablecloth , and hurled the buntile magnificently down the service elevator . Photographic M cCALL 'S MAGAZINE , so the story goes , after exhausting the supply of ladies from history for its covers and after long conferences , decided on a series depicting the most beautiful girl from each of the larger women 's colleges . The idea was heralded as a brilliant solution , and to grease the wheels each of the chosen beauties was to be brought to New York at the magazine 's expense to sit for the portrait and to be presented later with the original painting . Everything went smoothly in preparation ; finally Bryn Mawr was selected as the first college to he represented . A name and telephone number were given to Neysa McMein , the artist , who was asked to call her first model for an appointment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested the editor , " that you have seen her photograph . " Miss McMein was tact itself and managed the arrangement with ease . " But , " said the chosen lady , " where on earth did you see my photograph ? I have n't had one taken since 1900 when I graduated from college ! " Just what happened that switched the names and phone numbers of Bryn Mawr 's loveliest undergraduate and one of its alumni officials , has not yet been revealed , but the plans which took weeks to perfect , have now been abandoned and the new cover series will instead depict New York 's cutest babies from the largest apartment houses  --  beginning with the artist 's own . Excelsior BEFORE all the new buildings an Fifth Avenue are completed , we should like to call attention again to this matter of apexes . It is sad , as we remarked last winter , that the golden cockerel on the Heckscher Building should he overshadowed by higher and less arrogantly surmounted structures . Now we learn that new plans have been filed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories high , two of them to rise more than thirty-two stories and none of them with specifications mentioning a frivolous roof . It seems only fair that a silver penguin or at most a brass sparrow should surmount at least one of these , in order to preserve the gay aspect of the street . A gentleman has supplied us with astonishing statistics . Plans have been definitely filed , he says , for fifteen new buildings on the Avenue since the first of the year , half of them to be business offices and half apartments . It appears that half a dozen more are " reported . " The nineteen in course of construction include the already well known landmarks , the Fifth Avenue Hotel , the French , Aeolian , and Delmonico buildings , Waverly Apartments , Academy of Medicine , and the Synagogue , all of which ( so far ) measure up to our meticulous ideas of what Fifth Avenue buildings should be , save for this matter of a decorated tip . Further interesting information is that there are to he two new residences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanker , at No. 934 , and that of Mrs. Hamilton McKay Twombly at No. 900 . An announced twenty-three-story apartment at 824-26 Fifth Avenue , to be 245 feet high , has attracted the hawk-eyed Fifth Avenue Association and brought up the question of the tenement law , which , it appears , is faulty . A tenement house ( and this means an apartment house ) , according to city law , can he one and one-half times as high as the width of the street in which it is located . Fifth Avenue is thus allowed apartments 150 feet high , whereas Park Avenue , being much wider , can have even taller ones . There is , however , a catch : hotels and office buildings can go up the limit distance of 150 feet , with a tower above that as well . The obvious way , then , to circumvent the law is to call a tenement an apartment hotel , supply it with the necessary minimum of those features which distinguish a hotel , and thus go on up into the air . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fine that the building laws will have to he altered , it is said . Brunettes Preferred NATURALLY June Walker 's dark brown hair is carefully covered for the part of Lorelei in " Gentlemen Prefer Blondes , " and when she took a taxi from the wigmaker up to John Emerson 's , where she donned the new blond wig for his inspection , she kept the taxi waiting . The wig was approved and Miss Walker returned to her waiting taxi without the formality of removing the wig . " Sorry , mum , " said the driver , " this taxi 's already taken . " Surprised , she looked about for her cab and , not finding it , took another . It was some hours later that the infuriated driver sought an explanation and that Mr. Emerson finally paid the oversized bill . Prehistoric Mechanics WHAT with the masses taking up science , it is worthy of note that during the waning season an educational show was not only a success at Coney Island but the biggest money-maker there . George Mess-more and Joseph Damon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masterpiece of the successful exhibit , are contracting to put the animal on a vaudeville circuit and thus enlighten a few hundred thousand throughout the land . The synthetic animal industry , of which the Coney jungle , replete with Brontosaurus , Mammoth , Triceratop , et al. , is the high-water mark , had a humble origin . Messrnore and Damon , whose workshop was in West Twenty-seventh Street , began making for department-store window displays monkeys that stuck out their tongues and gradually worked up to elephants , which proved the most popular of their creations . Finally , they began working secretly in their shop and with the aid of the Museum of Natural History , they eventually completed a life-size , forty-nine-foot , 4,000-pound dinosaur which breathed , heaved , wagged its tail , and lifted a fifteen-foot neck with aid of ten electric motors concealed in its belly . This animal , too expensive to sell , was designed as a mere professional gesture , but when it made its debut at a display managers ' convention , a Newark department store rented it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riot . And thus , unexpectedly , its success began .
