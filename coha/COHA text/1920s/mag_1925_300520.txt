A prescription is something that a physician writes with a gold fountain pen on a little pad with incredible rapidity . " Get that filled , " he says with a cheery nod , and drives away in his buggy or his Isotta limousine . The person lying sick tries to read the hieroglyphics scrawled on the bit of paper . Those venomous little curlicues , what do they mean ? Of course the chances are that the physician was an honest fellow , but-well , there is something sinister about a prescription , the sick one thinks . It might mean absolutely anything . Suppose the doctor had taken a dislike to him ; he might have written : <P> " Apothecary : Burn this one 's insides out with cyanide of mercury and oblige , <P> DR . DRUGGET . " <P> Or suppose , on the other hand , that the doctor was honest , but that the pharmacist , unable to read what had been prescribed , made some fatal mistake ? And who could read a rigmarole like that ? <P> Reasoning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Middlesex , England , wrote a physician a letter which was read before the local medical committee : <P> " I have been trying to force medical men who are rotten writers to use typewriters . I guess you would come under that rule . It does n't strike me as a fair deal to your patients that your writing should not be so legible that any chemist could read it . Suppose it were urgent and none but Blank could read the writing and Blank 's store was closed . You would sign a death certificate just so . A nod is as good as a wink , and this note may lead to some intelligibility . " <P> The committee reported : " This letter is . . . most improper . "
