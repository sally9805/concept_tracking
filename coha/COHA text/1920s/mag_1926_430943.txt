WHILE Crown P r i n c e Gustav Adolph of Sweden was touring the United States recently , he was introduced to one of the most interesting languages in the world ? the sign language of the American Indian . It was at Los Angeles , during ceremonies by which the Prince was installed as a member of the great Arapahoe tribe . Seated on a blanket , surrounded by feathered braves , the future Swedish ruler watched with rapt attention while the tribesmen went through the ceremonial , speaking their silent welcome by means of earnest gestures . Every one of the gestures conveyed a definite meaning , which was interpreted for the Crown Prince by Colonel Timothy McCoy , one of the few white men who understand the Indian sign language . At once the Prince was impressed by the effective simplicity with which men could convey their thoughts without words . By coincidence , it was at about the same time that the fascinating secrets of this ancient language were revealed to us all in a book prepared by a man who has spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western plains ? the Blackfoot , Cheyenne , Sioux , Arapahoe , and other tribes . He is William Tomkins , of San Diego , California . For forty-one years he has known the Indians and their language . As a boy , working on the cow range on the edge of the Sioux Reservation in Dakota back in the ' 80 's , he made close friends among the redskins . He learned to talk with them , first by the signs understood by all Indians from one side of the continent to the other , then in their spoken languages . Ever since that time he has delved into the romance of America 's first inhabitants , their customs , speech , and strange picture writings carved in the rocks . His knowledge he now passes on to the rest of us in the form of a dictionary , entitled Indian Sign Language , of nearly 800 Indian word signs and their meanings . Most of these signs , like the ones illustrated here , are such wonderfully natural and graphic expressions of thought that they can be learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Tomkins has listed and translated 2.20 of the strange picturewords which story tellers of the Sioux and Ojibway nations once carved in the rocks or painted on wood or leather . One of these picture stories , with the translation . is reproduced here also . The Indian sign language , Mr. Tomkins says , has , a romantic history unequaled by any other . It is probably the first American language . Certainly it is the first and only universal language . It is older than the pyramids , and it is the most important gesture language the world has ever produced . - Unquestionably it was born of necessity- , In North America there were so many tribes , speaking so many tongues , that the continent was an immense Babel . When strange tribesmen met , if they were friendly , they managed to exchange a few simple sentiments by signs with their hands . During years of these occasional contacts , the signs increased in number until a Comanche and an Ohio Indian could carry on a long conversation without uttering a sound except an occasional grunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tribesmen held councils , agreed to treaties , and planned campaigns , all with gestures . As you look at the signs illustrated on these pages , you 'll be surprised to see how natural and understandable they are . At least some of them , you 'll say , are exactly the gestures you might use if you had to speak with your hands . In fact , a few of them are precisely the same gestures we palefaces actually use for emphasis . For instance , who has not expressed the word " done ! " by emphatically brushing the palms of the hands together ? That is pure Indian . And how man . times have you said , " Come over here . " by beckoning with your finger ? That 's Indian , too . Can you think of anything more - expressive of " escape " than the Indian way of crossing the wrists , hands closed , then abruptly separating the hand . swinging them to right and left ? Even more readily will you recognize the gesture for " give " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanings of some ' other signs may not be quite obvious , you 'd find it difficult to devise more perfect gestures for the thoughts they convey . Thus , the Indian idea of " mourning " is expressed by clipping with the fingers at the back of the head as though shearing off the hair ; then , with the two forefingers , indicating tears coursing down the cheeks . " Dance " is indicated . by raising both  | hands , pointing upward and wriggling them up and down quite in the manner of modern jazz singers . Holding the left hand palm upward , and squeezing the tips of the right hand fingers together above it , signifies " powder . " Again , the idea of " corn " is conveyed by imitating the act of shelling corn . The left index finger and thumb are projected as though they were an ear of corn ; then they are twisted by the corresponding fingers of the right hand . " Woman " is indicated by making the movement of combing the hair , combined with a feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to indicate " girl . " To say " book , " the Indian would hold both hands in front of him , side by side , palms up , and look at them as if reading . If he continued the same gesture by sweeping his hands apart , he was saying " newspaper . " Especially interesting is the way the Indian would combine several signs to indicate one word . For example , to say " the President , " he would combine three signs , for " whites , " " chief " and " big , " and then ' with the left hand point toward Washington . To indicate " whites , " he would make the sign for " color " and then rub with the tip of the right index the small segment at the upper end of the left thumb nail . " Chief " was indicated by holding the right hand at the side , pointing upward , raising the hand in a gradual circle as high as the top of the head , then arching toward front and downward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands together in front of him , palms in , ? and separate the hands , bringing them apart but still opposite each other . All this means " President . " Similarly , " Bible " was indicated by combining the signs for " book " and " medicine ; " " brave " by combining the signs for " heart and " strong ; " " bridge " by combining the signs for " river " and " across . " One wide difference between the Indian sign language and the signs used by the ( leaf and dumb is shown in the word " think . " The originators of the Indian signs thought that thinking or understanding was done with the heart , and made the sign " drawn from the heart . " Deaf mutes place extended fingers of the right hand against the forehead , to give the same meaning . The deaf use a great deal of facial contortion and grimace . The Indians seldom used facial expression , but maintained a composed and dignified countenance , the signs being sufficiently expressive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sign language than to read it , for usually a sign sentence is made up of nouns and verbs that have many shades of meaning . The exact meaning of a sign must be determined by other signs accompanying it . Qualifying words , articles , prepositions , and so on , are absent . Indians never bothered , Mr. Tomkins says , to find signs for " the , " " a " and " an . " They used the sign for " question " when they wished to ask one , instead of starting off with such words as " what , " " where , " " why , " and " when . " If one wanted to ask : " Will you make the fire ? " he made the following signs : Question ? you work ? fire . " What do you want ? " the Indian would express by the sign words : Question ? you ? want . The words " we " and " they " would be made by the signs : Me ? all . He ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he " or " she " was by adding the sign for " man " or " woman . " Past tense was indicated by adding the signs for " long time . " These very crudities are the things that add charm to this picturesque language . Now that the signs are at last available and inter preted , many people , it is said , are learning to converse the Indian way . The beauty of this sign talk , Mr. Tomkins cm phasizes , depends upon the manner of making the gestures . Movements should not be angular or jerky , but should rather be rounded and sweeping in their rendition . It is inspir ing and a thing of beauty , he says , to witness a sign conversation be tween two capabieIndian sign talkers . The few who are left are living in many parts of our country , and , Mr. Tom kins advises , should be cultivated w h e r e v e r found .  |                 @ @ @ @
