Hotel Astor. at which Viscount Cecil received the medal and check of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation for his pre-eminent services to the cause of peace based on justice , the distinguished guest was introduced as Lord Robert Cecil  --  his former ( and inferior ) title  --  the name being pronounced as if spelt Cessil . Sometimes , in America , one hears the pronunciation Ceesil , though the other is much commoner . Both , in fact , are incorrect ? so far , at least , as the family of which the Marquis of Salisbury is the titular head is concerned . The proper pronunciation of the word is Cissil . If Lord Cecil . who for his public services has been permitted to drop his honorary title and assume a title of his own , ' le to visit this country often ( as all will wish who have had the privilege of meeting him here or hearing him speak ) , it may be just as well to pronounce his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to hearing it pronounced at home . We may feel very sure , though , that the matter is not one over which a man of his calibre 13 apt to lose much sleep . In ? passing , It may be noted that an American family , in the South , writes its name Cissel ? an evident adaptation of the spelling to the old and correct pronunciation . J. B. G. New York .
