txt Returning to Ohio to fight Senator Harding for the twenty-four votes of their home State , Governor James M. Cox continued today to - address throngs which by their size and enthusiasm were accepted by his supporters as testimony to the quickened impulse of the Democratic Presidential candidate 's campaign . The Governor declared tonight that it was no longer a question of counting his crowds by the thousands , but of measuring them by the acre . Favorable reports met the Governor as he crossed the Ohio River on a ferry boat which he , helped to guide to the shore . A crowd of his old political friends greeted him as he once more set foot en the soil of the Buckeye State and assured him that " the swing " was on in Ohio to an even greater extent , they believed , than could be true in other parts of the country . The change was so great , the Governor was told , that it would sweep him to victory next Tuesday . He took , up . the tidings and conveyed them.LO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hard fight , " he said , " but victory is ours . Some time ago we drove the enemy out of the first and second line trenches . . Now he has been driven from his last defences and is on the run . " ? Sig Meeting in Cincinnati . The end of another remarkable day of campaigning came in this city tonight with ' a meeting in Music Hall , where thousands , unable to gain admittance , stood outside to cheer- the candidate as ' he made his way through them . Governor Cox has long been popular in Cincinnati , which is a Republican stronghold : He began his career here as a reporter on The Cincinnati Enquirer , and he had upset political tradition by capturing - Hamilton County in one of his fights for the Governorship . ? There has been grave doubt as to his ability to make much headway here this year on account of the big German vote . The Republicans are claiming this vote as solid . In size and enthusiasm , hpwever , the meeting tonight took rank among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the exception of a visit to Indianapolis on Thursday evening and to Chicago on Saturday night , Governor Cox will devote the rest of his campaign to Ohio : This is accepted as the great battleground of the nation , and there appears to be agreement among many political observers that as Ohio goes so will go the country . . The Republicans have been centring their fight here for some time . More Republican money has been spent in this State , it is said , than in any other . The organization has been perfected down to minute details . By Means of the thorough work of the party organisation it is believed that virtually every Republican Voter in the State has been registered . Particular attention has been paid to the negro women voters . for it is realized that they represent an absolutely solid Republican block . The Democrats were slower in getting under way in the State , but they are working with wonderful spirit now . Senator Harding 's continued presence in Marion has helped inspire the Republican workers . Governor Cox had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his campaign under headway and necessarily had to leave Ohio largely to his friends , but they ' have proved intensely loyal . Gives Soidlere ' Ines for League . One of the most striking incidents of the campaign marked ' the Music Hall meeting tonight . In the midst of a fervent plea for the League of Nations , Governor Cox took from his pocket the last copy of " The Stars and Stripes , " published in France by , American soldiers . With the horrors of the war still fresh upon them , the editors of this Paper made a stirring appeal for a League of Nations . They declared that ' it was only the men who had suffered in actual contact with the war at the front who could say what the heritage of the conflict should be . Governor Cox said he knew that the men of the American expeditionary forces were for the League of Nations . He had talked with thousands of them , especially the wounded and disabled in hospitals . Other thousands had marched in the parades which had marked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said to him : Governor , no man who had to wear a gas mask for twelve hours will vote against you or the League of Nations in this campaign . " As has been the ease with most of his meetings of late , the gathering In . Music ' Rail took on marked fervor . Governor Cox brought tears to the eyes of some of his hearers when he read a letter from a Gold Star mother in New Jersey , who had sent four of her sons to the war and had lost two of them in . Frazee. while a third is still " unfit " as the result of passing through a gas attack . This Gold Star mother sent a " widow 's mite " to help along the Governor 's campaign . Open to Reservations " With Honor . " Governor Cox reiterated in all of his speeches today his willingness to accept from the Senate any reservations which would make possible America 's entry into the League of Nations with honor . " I have found , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we use in keeping our pledge as it is that the meaning be clear and that the only possible step now available be taken to keep wars from being in the future . " He also made a special plea , for the election of Senators who would be for the League , saying : " Do n't tie my hands . " The Governor declared that a year ago Ex-President Taft predicted that the League of Nations would make its greatest appeal to Church people , to the workingman , because it would bring blessings and benefits to workers all over the world , and to the women because of the great sacrifices they are called upon to take in war , sacrifices often greater than those of the battlefield itself . " Mr. Taft , in this respect at least , has ? proven himself a wonderful prophet , " said Governor Cox . " All that he said has come true , and the elements to whom he said the Covenant would appeal , are the very elements that- are going to . vote this year to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are almost 100 percent . for the League ? labor Is all but unanimous . while of the newly enfranchised women I confidently believe that the ratio , despite family political ties . will be at least two and one-half to one in favor of the League . " Spoke In Rain at Kenova . Governor Cox campaigned through the first rainstorm he has encountered since he left Portland , Ore. , six weeks ago . His first speech of the day was at Kenova , W. Va .. and it began to rain while he was facing an immense crowd in the ball park . Some one offered to hold an umbrella over him , but he waved aside the profered shelter . I 'm weatherproore ? he , laughed . " Do n't mind me . Our great fight is won , and during the fighting we have had some of the most wonderful weather that could be imagined . Now - we are having the benediction of Heaven 's grace and approal . " From Kenova , v Governor Cox crossed into Kentucky and spoke at Catlettsburg and Ashland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first trip away from Marion . At both places enormous crowds were out to hear the Democratic candidate dee spite the intermittent squalls of rain . At Ashland Mrs. Robert Dickens , who introduced Governor Cox , compared hirn to Washington , le:ricoln and other great characters in history who have arisen in crises . Governor Cox proceeded from Ashland by automobile to Fullerton , where an Ohio River ferry was boarded for the trip to Portsmouth . It was there that he helped pilot the boat across , the regular pilot directing the course while the Governor turned the big wheel . Portsmouth is a Republican City , but Governor Cox has carried it in all his fights and his popularity in the community was evidenced by the two meetings he addressed . onr being outdoors in the rain , and the other in the high school . At the latter place the Governor had an honor guard of gold star mothers and Civil War . veterans on the stage . The railroad workers of the city took a holiday to hear him . During the day the Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a special appeal to them . lie remarked that the Republican candidate was asking for a return to " normalcy " and asked : . " Do you know what that means ? " " No , " shouted some of his hearers . " Well , " he went on , " a return to normalcy means a return to the good old times of the long day and the short pay envelope . You do n't want a return to that , do you ? Of course not . There is not a man within the sound of my voice but has more money in his pocket or in the bank than he did eight years ago and there - are more home owners in the United States today than at any time under Republican rule . " We hear much talk of the people , wanting a change . It is fostered only by the professional politicians who are out and want a change so they can get back into office . " Nominee 's Speech In Cincinnati . Governor Cox 's Cincinnati speech was chiefly devoted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperialist in Europe Is opposed to the League . It is a striking coincidence that the only thing approaching imperialism in America , the Senatorial oligarchy , is the outstanding force in opposition to it in America . " The hope of the world is in the revived spirit of an awakened democracy in all nations . An- evidence of this is the insistence upon the part of the people in Germany that the country become a member of the League of Nations . Application has already been made . The German people realize that there can be no recovery from the disasters of war unless the burden of armaments is removed and a guarantee against war is established . ' I am convinced that the people of Mexico , impelled by the impulse for good that seems to have possessed that country , will insist upon membership in the League also , because they realize that among other interests opposing the covenant in America are the speculators who want to invade that country with the army of the United States in order to remove the hazard which enabled them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - been , and our pilgrimage has covered thirty-six States , the farmers recognize not only that the Federal Reserve and farm loan banking systems must be preserved against the big interests that now surround the Senatorial candidate for the Presidency , but that continued prosperity in America is contingent upon our becoming a member of the League . The difference between depression and prosperity in America is the demand for our surplus products . Without the European market . American energies , agricultural and industrial , must subside at least 33 per cent . The spiritual consideration is , of course , more controlling . America always wants to do the proper thing , and it is perfectly apparent that the issue is well defined as to whether we will be a nation of honor or a nation of repudiators . We gave a very definite pledge when we went into the war , and it must he determined now whether the promise given to our soldiers and their mothers is to be redeemed . " I have found that America is not so much concerned in ' the words we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning be clear and that the only possible step now available be taken to keep wars from being in the future . Letter from a War Mother . " I want to read to you now a copy of a letter which has come to me which expresses , beyond what words of mine might do , that which is in the heart of the mothers of America : Please accept the enclosed small contribution to the fund for dissemination of the truth about the League of Nations . It is literally a " widow 's mite , " but it comes from a mother who sent four greatly needed sons to the World War . ? Two of these sons were killed , a third was held . in the hospitals in Franc , e for five months due to gassing in action , and is still classified as " unfit , " and a fourth risleed his precious young life in the air . When an honest and concerted effort is being made by the nations of the earth to save , if possible , the mothers of son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are those who oppose such an effort . I feel sure that among those who paid for the war there can be but one opinion , and that is to try the League of Nations . Even if it is not perfect it is the best that has been proposed and , all objections being weighed , is manifestly the most feasible . Please God it will not fall . Very truly yours , MRS . EDWARD CRAWFORD DAVIDSON , Elizabethtown , N. J. " I have been deeply impressed by the determination to keep the pledge which fills the very souls of the boys who were in the trenches overseas and who know what the hell of modern warfare is . They do not indulge in idle phrase , but use the words which mean determination for the cause . I have visited the hospitals for disabled soldiers wherever I have gone , and have talked to men who are maimed and men whose lungs are all but gone from having breathed the poisonous gases in the trenches . At Phoenix , Ariz. , one said to me ' Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours will vote against you or the League of Nations in this campaign . ' " He knows what the torture of war is , nor does he want those who come in after generations to have to go through what he knows and what he has seen . These men and their mothers are going to have something to say about it and in terms that can not be misunderstood . ' View from Soldiers ' Paper . " I hold in my hand and read to you from the last issue of the Stars and Stripes , gotten out by the ' doughboys ' in the very sight of the trenches in which their comrades died and where they could see the graves of the 81,000 brave American lads who laid down their lives for the cause of world democracy and world peace : We have finished , and we have the satisfaction of knowing that we did a good job . We are glad to quit , but Can we carry the message home ? Print ca n't do it , photographs ca n't do it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the murder turned to romance . Nobody under God 's great tranquil skies can tell of the rottenness of war but the men who suffered through it . Upon them rests a solemn duty , they must go home and check the coward jingo who masks himself behind ? his false arid blatant patriotism , and the merchant politician , not content with stuffing his own coffers until they burst , but - anxious to barter his country 's manhood for new places in the sun . The Prussian Guardsman died hard fighting for such a place . The men in frock coats ' who make the laws never had to stand up against him . They never took a machine-gun nest or saw a barrage wall roll down , stop , and then uncurtain into a wall of shrieking steel . We know , but we can not give that knowledge to others , but upon it we can act . We can ? help build a League of Nations with such sinews ' of war and such conscience for peace that no one will dare oppose it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own foolish heads , which by the grace of God , chance or some Prussian Guardsman 's aim are still upon our foolish shoulders . Each one of 81.000 men who died is a sacred reason why America dare not now falter . As he died , his eyes resting on the Stars and Stripes for the last time , he read there the pledge , which had been given to him and which had been given to the country , that he was making his contribution to future generations in order that war might be no more for all time . In his ears rang the music of America 's answer to " Flandees Fields , " in the words of our own poet , Lillard , the words that were sung as assurances to those who died that they had not died in vain Rest ye in peace , ye Flanders dead . The fight that ye so bravely led We have taken up , and we will keep True faith with you who lie asleep . With each a cross to mark his bed And poppies blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So let your rest be sweet and deep in Flanders fields . Fear not that ye have died for naught . The torch ye threw to us we caught . Ten million hands will hold it high , And - Freedom 's light shall never die . We have learned the lesson that ye taught in Flanders fields . Says Died a Martyr . CINCINNATI , Oct. 26 ( Associated Press ) . ? Governor Cox , in his speech here tonight , received ' long applause when he gave his views on the starvation of Lord Mayor of Cork . " How about ? " a man shouted from a box . " In my opinion , " the Governor replied , " died as a martyr . Martyrs grow , almost always , from centuries of injustice and oppression . I believe the martrydom of will enrage the Englieh people as they were enraged against the injustice King George visited upon the American colonies . " Same say that the Irish question is a religious question . Of the last ' ten or twelve leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestants . Therefore it ca n't be regarded as a religious question . " The : crowd approved vigorously the Governor 's statement that the League of Nations had the universal indorsement of religious denominations . Prolonged applause greeted the names of Pope Benedict and Cardinal Gibbons , who are prominent sponsors , the speaker said . Governor Cox ' reiterated his charge that Senator Harding was trying to win the Presidency " under false pretenses , " because , the speaker said , he had " wiggled and wabbled " upon the League issue . The Governor called attention to speeches yesterday by former President Taft and Senator Johnson of California , respectively , at Ogden , Utah , and Canton , Ohio . In his speech Mr. Taft was quoted as saying that Senator Harding 's election would insure American participation in the League . Senator Johnson , the Governor said , contended that Harding would " scrap " the hall hissed the Senator 's name and Californian warned against any other " indefinite " plan . Hisses for Round Robin Senators . The audience cheered the Governor when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also in the hall hissed the Senator 's naem and those of others who signed the " round robin . " Predicting a " landslide for the cause of peace " in the election , Governor Cox reiterated his opinion that Senators Brandegee of Connecticut , Smoot of Utah , Moses of New Hampshire , Watson of Indiana and other Republican Senatorial candidates who signed the " round robin " would be defeated . He urged support of W. A. Julian , the Democratic Senatorial candidate in Ohio . Senator Harding , Governor Cox predicted , would " spend the next four years at Marion , Ohio . " and referring to Senator Moses the Governor repeated that he was " one Moses who might well have been left in the bullrushes . " " Whenever my opponent is given . a vacation from the front porch , " the Governor said , " he has been making speeches for me , too . " Governor Cox defended vigorously the mingling of the League covenant with the Treaty of Versailles . " Our boys fought for it , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had promised it to our soldiers arid to their mothers and unless it had been placed in the Treaty of Peace we would have lost , in all probability , the outstanding compensation of that great war . " Tomorrow will be spent by the Governor on home soil . He will speak in the morning at Middletown , his birthplace , and tomorrow night ? at Dayton , , his home .
