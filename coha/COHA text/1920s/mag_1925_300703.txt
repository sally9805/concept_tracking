Despatches from Italy last week assumed almost the stereotyped cast of official bulletins , as Fascist censors ruthlessly blue-penciled all reports considered unfavorable to Il Duce ( Benito Mussolini ) or to Fascismo itself . <P> Foreign Censorship . The 56th birthday of King Vittorio Emanuele was celebrated at a reception tendered him by the Government and Premier Mussolini at the Capital . Foreign newspapermen were barred even from attendance at this function by the adroit form in which the official invitos were cast . It was specifically required that every male guest appear in uniform , and since even those foreign correspondents in Rome who are military men had left their uniforms at home , cables reported that all of them were refused admittance. + For good measure , numerous Italians who had outgrown their military trappings or allowed them to suffer from neglect were also barred . Despatches asserted that the American Ambassador , Henry P. Fletcher , was the only male guest who was allowed to appear in strictly civilian attire . <P> Local Censorship . The alleged attempt by the Socialist Zaniboni to assassinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , the excuse for much of this relentless clamping down upon anti-Fascist activities . News leaked through to the effect that Il Rivoluzione Liberale , noted anti-Fascist organ at Turin , had been suppressed ; and at Rome a similar fate overtook the Avanti , Giustizia , Unita Cattolica and Voce Republicana , while other opposition papers such as Il Mondo and Il Risorgimento were " allowed to continue publication , although their entire issues were seized daily . " <P> In Yugo-Slavia . Friction between Italy and Yugo-Slavia was generated , curiously enough , by the Zaniboni affair . At Trieste the Slavonian newspaper Edinost published accusations to the effect that the whole Zaniboni " plot " had been " framed " by Fascist leaders to embarrass the Opposition and serve as an excuse for further tyranny . Promptly Fascists attacked and severely damaged both the offices of Edinost and the Yugo-Slavian consulate at Trieste . <P> At once anti-Fascist and anti-Italian demonstrations took place in reprisal at Belgrade , Agram , Laiback , Spalato and other Yugoslavian cities . Apparently the Government of Yugo-Slavia made almost frantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Italian flags , attacks on Italian consulates and some scattered plundering of Italian-owned shops . Foreign Minister Nintchitch of Yugo-Slavia promptly despatched a note of apology to the Italian Government , and was reviled as a " traitor " by many of his countrymen for so doing . The incident appeared closed with the alleged arrival at Belgrade of an Italian note in which the original Fascist outbreak at Trieste was " deplored " and the Yugo-Slavian apology accepted . <P> +But Miss Beatrice Baskerville , New York World correspondent , was present .
