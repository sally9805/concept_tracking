txt // being mythical . Such is the case among the Tlinkit of the Northwest Coast of North America . Among Chinese , Greeks , Romans , Teutons , the kinship group was related through males , actual or mythical ; among the Tlinkit the relationship was traced through females to a mythical founder of the totem group to which the kin belonged . The recognition of one blood tie implies , of course , the failure to recognize other blood ties as socially binding . The Local Group .  --  Locality may be the tie which holds the group together . Such local groupings are found among the widely scattered Eskimo peoples . It is a common feature of the grouping in the Plains area of North America , where the bands are of larger composition than in the sparsely populated Eskimo belt . Local grouping , with strong emphasis on family bonds , is found among the Veddas and in the Andaman Islands . Many African tribes exemplify it in combination with other social bonds , such as the kraal in South Africa . Perhaps most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort to local grouping , frequently combining it with other social adhesions . Clan and Gens.  --  A group which functions as a unit in tribal life and which recognizes matrilineal descent is a clan ; a group functioning as a unit and practicing patrilineal descent is a gens . Greek and Roman life furnish examples of the latter . Clans or gens are well developed in many parts of North America , notably on the Northwest Coast . Another area of high development is the Southwest of the United States , with similar groupings in parts of the Plains area . Clans or gens usually function in connection with exogamy , as is well illustrated by Northwest Coast culture . Moiety.  --  Sometimes a tribe is divided into two large sections , called moieties . The division dichotomizes the tribe , though the parts , not being equal , can not correctly be called " halves . " Such dichotomous divisions are found in parts of Australia , among the Todas , and through most of the Northwest Coast area of North America . The distribution of moieties is highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether the moiety was primary and broke up into clans or gens , or whether a combination of gens or clans gave rise to moieties , we can not say . Perhaps in different areas the two processes were separately at work . In all probability the one gave rise to the other , though the areas in which the one or the other of these respective processes went on we are not able to identify , since in ethnology there is little to guide us in making historical reconstruction . In the absence of history , logic is not sufficient . The Tribe .  --  A group integrated by a commonly recognized authority and acknowledging no external authority is a tribe . A tribal arrangement is nearly ubiquitous in savagery , but not quite so . The Eskimos , for example , are not a tribe or a collection of tribes , but rather groups of peoples sharing a common language and a common culture , but without tribal authority . The tribe functions as a political unit . Though this is evident in time of peace , the integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It then appears as the group which may consider any other group its enemy ; and some other group is always a potential enemy . The activities of the tribe are not subject to authority emanating from without ; independence is the crucial test of tribal reality . The Confederacy.  --  Tribes banded together constitute a confederacy . Confederacies are not common in savagery , constituting , it would seem , a more complicated political arrangement than is feasible at this stage of culture . Practically always it exists for purposes of war , usually for aggressive war . Confederacies existed among the Maoris , who were martially and politically a highly developed people . They were known to the Northern Iroquois , who developed and for a long time maintained the confederacy known as the Five Nations ( later the Six Nations ) . The almost continually warring Plains tribes seem not to have been given to confederacies , operating usually as politically isolated tribes or bands , though perhaps a loose confederacy existed among the Dakotas. // SOCIAL AUTHORITY Custom .  --  A regulator of life in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract way of expressing the tendency of individuals in a community to conform to accepted standards , there can be no doubt that this tendency is a conservative element . Being conservative , it has the force of virtual authority . To say that custom regulates is but a way of saying that society regulates itself along those lines which we call custom . Yet the regulation which grows out of behavior has a tendency to force behavior into accepted channels , so that custom has a compulsory aspect . No group in savagery , as no group in civilization , is without custom , and in no group can individuals defy it for long . Tradition .  --  Closely related to custom is tradition . Tradition is the rationalized portion of social behavior , as custom is its objective behavioristic side . People not merely do things in a fixed fashion , they find reasons for doing them . The reasons which they discover are their traditions . The traditions take on a historical background , being thrust back into the beginnings of the group life or into some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myths , but for the savage they represent what happened and not merely what he wishes may have happened . The wish which brought them into existence gives place to the faith that they really did exist ; the wish drops out of consciousness as faith in their historicity dominates . " This is what our fathers told us , " is the justification for many of the tenets of savagery  --  and , for that matter , of civilization . We differ from savages in degree rather than in kind . Public Opinion .  --  Potent in every primitive community is public opinion . Savages are not unappreciative of the opinions of their fellows . Indeed , one may say that public opinion reigns supreme in savagery . The savage can face the spears of the enemy , but not the taunts of fellow-tribesmen . He has physical courage , but little moral courage to stem the tide of public opinion . In some communities , such as those of the Eskimos , public opinion , custom , and tradition constitute about the only elements of authority . Not least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community sometimes brings about the death of a man , shames men into doing courageous acts of which they otherwise are not capable , brings the guilty to justice , and confers rewards upon the deserving.On the Northwest Coast of North America public opinion enforces clan regulations ; in the Plains area it regulates conduct in the ceremonial . organizations ; in African tribes it is a scourge with which to lash the recalcitrant , a balm to those who suffer injustice . A detailed account of its working would include the whole of savagery.The important part which it plays in savagery is due to the unrestrained publicity which characterizes the lowly cultures . The savage lives a life in common with his fellows , having about him few of the barriers which conduce to privacy . When he thinks , he thinks aloud , his words are words to everybody . As no man lives to himself alone , so none is free from the opinions of his fellows.The Elders .  --  Kinship terms frequently connote age , which in social life plays an important part . The words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases , as among many Australian tribes , a group of elder men regulate tribal affairs . In the Plains area of North America was a tiotipi , an old men 's tipi , to which the people went for counsel in peace or in war . Most of the older civilizations inculcated a respect for the aged which invested them with authority.Executive Council .  --  Often the group of elders is organized into an executive council largely responsible for the conduct of tribal affairs . In many cases there is an executive assembly not composed wholly of the elders , perhaps not primarily of elders . Among the Northern Iroquois , for example , assemblies of women supervised certain tribal affairs.On the Northwest Coast of North America assemblies within the exogamous moiety division deliberated about intramoiety affairs and settled many a dispute . The palavers of African tribes were virtually such councils . They consti354 SOCIAL ORGANIZATION tuted an important part of Maori life , determining war or peace and deciding the succession to the chieftainship . Headman and Chief .  --  At the head of many a clan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily lies the duty of determining policy and of seeing that the desires of the group are carried out . Direction of tribal affairs by a man of authority constitutes chieftainship . Chieftainship is seldom unqualifiedly inheritable , the right to the succession depending upon qualifications for office . In certain societies , however , as in the highly evolved social structures of the Northwest Coast of North America , inheritance of chieftainship is a well-established right , the succession being handed on through the sister 's son , the line of descent being matrilineal . In less evolved social structures merit plays a large part in determining the succession . King .  --  There is no distinction , other than an arbitrary one , between a chief and a king . When the office is elaborately developed and the executive is recognized as above and apart from the rest of his tribesmen , we speak of the incumbent as king . So defined , the institution flourishes in West Africa . It is not a feature of the less evolved African cultures and was absent from the New World , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central and South America . SOCIAL CLASSES : CASTES AND HIERARCHIES Where social life is elaborate in its distinctions and in its forms of organization , there are frequently castes or hierarchies . Such social classes are a feature of Polynesian culture . They are found in the highly developed civilizations of West Africa , and in the cultures of Central America and the Andean region . Something approaching the caste system is found in the Northwest Coast region , where the totem groups constitute a hierarchy . The distribution of castes and social hierarchies is correlated with the development of chieftainship and kingship . No social classes exist where there are no prerogatives of chief or of SOCIAL ORGANIZATION 35 : royalty . Also they are correlated with economic and industria development . Endogamy is a feature of caste and of socia hierarchy . SECRET SOCIETIES AND CEREMONIAL ORGANIZATIONS Secret societies are not limited to colleges and the communities of western European civilization . They existed ii the early Mediterranean cultures , particularly in ancien Greece , where they took the form of religious cults . In man areas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notably in the Southwest of the United States and in Wes Africa . They are found also in Melanesia , Australia , any parts of Polynesia . These secret religious orders are in all o the areas mentioned restricted to men and their nature mus under no circumstances be revealed to women . Frequently too , their membership is confined to a few members of th male sex . In parts of West Africa and in Melanesia the perform a function something like that of the Ku Klux Klar operating in the dark and under cover of disguises . Much more numerous are the ceremonial organization : These flourish most abundantly in the Plains area of th United States , particularly among the various bands of th Dakotas , where they are sometimes described as dance orgar izations , a dance being a phase of their activities . A widel distributed one in this area is the War Dance society , compose of those who have taken scalps or have counted coup on th enemy . Scalp locks attached to hoops were commonly use in the celebrations of this organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vow not to tur their back upon the enemy and not to desert a fellow member during a fight with the enemy . Another , found also in th adjacent Algonkian Woodland area , is composed of medicine men and medicine-women , the wakana watchipi . Still anothe is known as the Raw Dog Liver Eaters , from the practice o eating the raw liver of the dog during the celebration of thei rites . The Clowns , who are powerful medicine-men as we as clowns , also have their organization , a feature of the celebrations being the extraction with bare hands and arms of th // tongue of the buffalo from the kettle of boiling water in which the meat is being cooked . Clown organizations are found also in the Southwest . TOTEMISM A group which functions as a unit and which has as its distinguishing characteristic an animal or thing which serves as its symbol is known as a totem group , and the animal or object serving as the emblem is called its totem . Totem comes from Central Algonkian , where it connotes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or trance , which assists him in the hunt or on the warpath . Totemism is of wide distribution , as a glance at the map in Frazer 's four-volume work on Totemism and Exogamy , will show . It rages in Australia , and is found inv Polynesia , in parts of India , in regions in Africa , and in elaborate form on the Northwest Coast of North America . Its distribution is interestingly discontinuous . Frequently it is associated with clans or gens . Only an animal or other symbol is needed to make a clan or gens into a totem group  --  though by what manner totemism came about we do not know . Generally it is associated with exogamy . Such is the case on the Northwest Coast , for example , where a man of one totem group must marry out of that group . In most Australian totemic tribes , however , there is no tabu upon marrying into one 's totem group . The tendency toward exogamy is in keeping with savage philosophy regarding the totem , which is that the totemites are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ akin . Frequently members of a totem group believe themselves descended from , the totem animal . The psychological implications of totemism are numerous : the appearance of the totem to the totemite in dream or trance ; the attribution to the totem of the qualities shared by the totemites . Its religious significance has been urged by many . Some students of religion think totemism had its origin in the worSOCIAL // ship of animals , and consider sacred animals relics of a decadent totemism . In many cases the animal which is tabu , like the pig to the Hebrews , is tabu not because of uncleanness , but because of prior sanctity . So , too , the eating of the animal some students of culture regard as a survival of an older method of placing oneself en rapport with the totem animal . By this means one imbibes its virtues , so that the communal eating of it is a sacrificial meal in which the worshipers literally imbibe the virtues of the god . But it is doubtful whether these theories would merit attention had they not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the theories of W. Robertson Smith , J. G. Frazer , and followers . The predominant interest which once attached to them is now largely in the discard  --  no doubt to be revived by some subsequent writer who approaches the problem from a new angle with the data of more recent ethnological researches . As regards origins , so much lies hidden that practically nothing can be said with surety , or even with comparative safety . Totemism is a differentiating factor of social importance . In Central Australia it brings the individual within a sphere of influences determined by the totemic orientation , providing helpmates in certain emergencies , determining ceremonial activities , and , in some tribes to the south , choice of a mate . This centering of interests , obligations , rights , activities , and delimitation of a field of experience and " education " gives totemic trend to the psychic life of the individual as well as to his social career . In some tribes of Southeast Australia sex totems play an important role , among the Yuins the emuwren being the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The welfare of the sex is bound up with that of its totem : " The life of a bat is the life of a man , " for the bat is " brother belonging to black fellow . " On Gunpowder Creek the death of the men 's totem heralds the death of a representative of the women 's totem . The " personal " totem , or guardian animal , found at Cape York and in Southeast Australia , provides extension of personality with potency for good as well as for ill . The Euah-II // layis look upon the personal totem as a sort of alter ego : A man 's spirit is in his Yunbeai and his Yunbeai 's spirit is in him . An injury to his Yunbeai is an injury to himself . In this tribe the individual totem , or protective animal , pertains to powerful medicine-men who represent highly developed personalities . CHAPTER XXX THE STATUS OF THE CHILD THE savage has a lively sense of the importance of childhood and inducts the child into tribal life by lengthy formal rites which insure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No people appreciates better than does he the social importance of childhood ; none is more concerned to conserve these resources for future tribal life . Even before the birth of the child the mother may have to abstain from certain foods or from designated activities which would , it is believed , unfavorably affect the unborn . From birth to adulthood magic assists the child in becoming accommodated to the new world of nature and of men . Nor is there a tendency to shorten the period of dependency upon elders . Children are not weaned until four to six years of age . Youths are inducted into tribal life by story and tradition , by the recital of legend or myth designed to stir imagination and impart instruction . The Yoruba story about a little girl 's adventures with a goblin , her reward for obedience and the punishment for disobedience , illustrates the type of instruction frequently imparted . Yet children may not hear stories at certain times of the day , nor during certain days of the year , for this would make them lazy and inert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daytime ; to do so would cause the children to have long ears and to be bitten by rattlesnakes . Amusements , however , are cherished and are abundant . In many instances the playful activities of children are an imitation of the pursuits of adulthood and thus a preparation for maturity . Boys throw spears at a mark or at smaller animals ; girls sew , cook , or play with dolls . Almost universally the children of savages are contented and well behaved . In decorum the 36o // children of primitive folk rank above the children of Europeans , who do not deserve the compliment of " little savages . ' ' Seldom do savages punish children , though their treatment of them often is inconsistent . Infanticide may prevail in a region where otherwise children are well treated . Usually , however , there are reasons for the practice : In Polynesia and in Australia it is usually owing to harsh economic conditions and to the necessity of keeping down the population . Among the Todas and the ancient Arabs , where polyandry was practiced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of plurality of husbands , and also , in part , a cause of polyandry . The treatment of orphans may be severe or indifferent , ; hough parents treat their own children kindly . In some cases , in tribes in which no one considers it a duty to look after the helpless orphan , it is buried with the mother  --  as in parts of California . If , however , the infant is raised , much thought is given to its care , particular attention being paid to its food and drink . Thus the Hudson Bay Eskimos will not allow the infant to take nourishment until it is three days old , and meanwhile no water may touch it . They swathe the child in skins and cloths , sphagnum moss , changed daily , being used next the body . When the infant is three days old the shaman ceremonially washes it , the assembled women wishing it , if a male , an active life ; if a female , expressing the hope that it will be the mother of many children . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , falls to the lot of the mother . The San Blas mother carries the child on her hip , but the prevailing method in North America is the use of the well-known cradle-board , the children being taught to shift for themselves at an early age . Among the Flatheads and the Nez Perces , children as young as three years of age were mounted alone , generally upon colts , and were lashed to the saddle so that they would not fall off when asleep ; for when overcome with fatigue and stupor they went to sleep , notwithstanding their precarious position . Asleep , they reclined upon the horse 's shoulder ; awake , they plied the whip vigorously , guiding the animal with great dexterity . Children // ) o young to sit in the saddle were carried in the cradle-board , ther on the mother 's back or suspended from a high knob n the fore part of the saddle . When about a month old ; skimo children are put into a jacket made from the skin of deer fawn and a cap of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child is carried in the mother 's hood . In some laces the Eskimo women wear large boots , in which they wry a small child . In most Eskimo huts babies are kept AImost constantly in the mother 's hood until about a year and half old , and then are allowed to play on the bed . After this age they are carried only in case they become too mishievous . If the mother is engaged at hard labor a sturdy girl arries the child . The Dyak mother carries the infant in a curious portable radle , a semicircular contrivance slung behind the shoulder , a which the infant sits erect with the legs hanging free . The Tasmanian mother carried the infant astride her shoulders , holding its hand to keep it from falling . In New South Vales , the new-born infant is carried by the mother on a piece f bark until the child is strong enough to sit on her shoulder vith its legs around her neck , holding to her hair to maintain tself upright . Various methods prevail in South Australia : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her arm or neck for support ; or it rides " pick-aback " ; or it is laid across its mother 's pack , the legs of the child under one of her forearms , its head under the other . This permits the mother to use both hands . Ainu babies are carried on the back . A plaited band resting , n the head of the nurse is attached to the two ends of a short tick on which the child sits ; another band passes round the hild and is secured about the body of the nurse , so that the hild will not fall from its precarious seat . The Dyaks welcome the birth of a son by the beating of drums and the firing of guns . For three days the father may iot drink water , and for five months he must sleep and eat in olitude , taking no salt with his food , not chewing sirih , and lot smoking . At the end of this period there is a feast , at 1 // which pigs and fowl are the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feast the infant is given a name . The Dyak child is nursed until it is two years of age , or older . Children are usually laden with silver bangles , strings of coins , shells , beads , small bells , and other ornaments which rattle . They lead a happy life , full of play , and they are always ready for a game . When they attain sufficient strength they engage in trials of endurance and skill . One rarely sees a Dyak child who is not running , jumping , fighting , or wrestling with one of its companions , or else carrying the war among the pigs or the poultry . In the evenings they dance or play the nose flute . They soon learn smoking from their parents . The dress of children is seldom the same as that of adults . Even when patterned after that of their elders it usually has some distinguishing characteristic . The Nenenots make the moccasins of young children more comfortable than those of adults , running a seam parallel with the toes , thus preventing creasing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same manner as elders , with the exception that their apparel is less carefully made . Often their clothing is " glazed with filth and glistening with vermin , " and they present a disgusting appearance . Infants usually have garments made in the " combination " style , the cap forming a " separate piece . As long as any portion of the navel string remains , the Central Eskimo child wears a strip of sealskin around the abdomen . A few days after birth the first dress of the child is exchanged for another . A small hood made from the skin of a hare 's head is fitted snugly upon the head , a jacket for the upper part of the body is made from the skin of a fawn , and two small boots , made of the same material , the left one wreathed with seaweed , cover the legs . While the child wears this clothing , that which was first worn is fastened to a pole secured to the roof of the hut . Two months later the child gets a third suit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time on the top of the hut , the first one is taken down , and both are carefully preserved for a year . At the // and of this time both are once more exposed on the top of a pole and are then sunk in the sea , a portion of the first birdskin dress alone being kept , for this is considered a powerful amulet and is held in high esteem and is worn on the point of the hood every fall at the Sedna feast . At about the age of eight , boys dress like men , and at about the age of nine or ten , girls dress like women . Where weather conditions permit , children of a tender age usually go naked . This is true of Australia , where , however , they sometimes wear a piece of worn-out rug . After the initiation ceremony , passed through at about the age of fourteen to sixteen , Moorundi boys may wear two kangaroo teeth and a bunch of emu feathers . Macquarrie parents decorate the hair of young children with fish bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quite commonly mutilations are practiced upon young children or upon the adolescent , usually as adornment or as record of status . The noses of Dieyerie children are pierced with wood when they are about five or six years old ; at about the age of ten or twelve the two front teeth of both boys and girls are knocked out ; when the beard of the boys appears the lads are circumcised . These mutilations , or similar ones , are most common in Australia and in Africa , particularly in East Africa . Betrothal of children , often when mere infants , is widely practiced , particularly in Oceania , as notably by the Maoris and by most Australian tribes . Child-marriage is most common in India , where arrangements for it usually are initiated by the father of the boy . If the Toda father succeeds in making arrangements for the wedding , he spends the night at the village of the girl , a few days later taking the boy to the home of his intended wife . They take with them the loin cloth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the boy performs the salutation of kalmelpudithti ( bowing and raising the foot of another to the forehead ) , to the girl 's father and mother and her brothers . Father and son stay one night at the girl 's village , returning home the following morning . Sometimes the girl goes with // them , but usually she remains in her home until she is fifteen or sixteen years of age . " From the time of child-marriage the boy has to give a tadrp twice a year until the girl is ten years old , when its place is taken by a putkuli . The tadrp ( loin cloth ) which is given at first is very small , worth , perhaps , only four amas , but as the girl becomes older it is expected that the garment shall become larger and more valuable . If any member of the girl 's family should die , it is expected that the boy 's family shall , on each occasion , give a sum of eight amas or a rupee . . . . Formerly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffaloes killed at the funeral , but the custom is now obsolete . " 1 Not infrequently children are called upon to participate in important ceremonies . Among the Todas a ceremony , called notiteiti , is performed by a little girl about six or seven years of age , when the inhabitants of the village are migrating . " Before leaving the village from which the people are coming , this girl will have been given food in the dairy . On reaching the new place , the girl plucks three blades of the slender grass called kakar and goes to the front of the dairy and sweeps the threshold with the grass . She does this with her right arm outside her cloak , and when she has swept she bows down with her forehead to the threshold three tirnes . . . . The dairyman then gives her a small handful of butter , and the girl goes to the huts . Up to this time women have been waiting near the village , but when they see the girl has performed her ceremony they go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at certain festivals , the young girls dance around the wooden image of the phallic god , Elegba , which is paraded in great pomp and pointed toward the young females , who respond with a dance . Hair-cutting ceremonies are found in many areas . At the first head-shaving ceremony held by the Todas special bangles are put on the wrist of the child ; it would fall ill if they were not used . In Siam , the first hair-cutting , which takes place when the child is twelve or fourteen years of age , is an im- // portant ceremony . No matter how poor the parents of a child , they provide an entertainment ; if rich , they spend a great deal of money on the affair . In Cambodia great importance is attached to the ceremony of hair-cutting . When a royal child reaches the age of seven years , the hair is cut by the king in the presence of the dignitaries of the land . In Panompin the ceremony is performed on an artificial mound euphemistically called a " mountain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Australia , Africa , North and South America , in fact , in some tribes in almost every large ethnographical area . In parts of Australia girls must submit to the multilation known as introcision , a practice correlated , to a large extent , with the subincision practiced upon males . At the second initiation ceremony undergone by girls in the Boulia district of Northwest Central Queensland , they are allowed to maltreat the men without limit , but after the introcision ceremony they must submit to intercourse with any man save one of the forbidden marriage class . At the first menstrual period the young Chinyanja girl is taken in charge by an old woman . If the girl has frequently shown an insolent nature this old woman collects the matrons , who tie the girl in a bundle of grass and throw her into the water . When the sun becomes hot she is taken out , put on the bank , and given a severe rebuke . While the girl is being put through the initiation ceremonies she is given much good advice , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for seniors , as well as much advice which is silly or obscene . Having passed through the initiation rites , she is taken by the women to her future husband 's hut , where ndiwo is being cooked . During the night the young wife puts some salt into the pot and next morning gives some of the food to her mother and to the woman who had charge of the initiation ceremony . This food the women rub on their feet and under their armpits . If a relation is abroad some of it is set aside for his return and no one gives him food or drink until he rubs this " medicine " on his feet . Among the Yorubas an operation , corresponding to the I 1 // circumcision practiced upon boys , is performed on girls , who are incised by women operators shortly before puberty  --  that is , between the ages of ten and twelve . The " menstrual feast " given by the Takelma father was one of three occasions when dances were held . Among the Nootka it was an elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwest Coast to southern California . Among the Diegueno the girls ' ceremonies differ widely from those of the boys . The most striking portion of the girls ' ceremony consists in the " roasting . " A large pit is dug , heated by a fire built over it , then partly filled with green bark . A number of girls , who previously have drunk tobacco crushed in water , lie at full length in the pit . Dry brush is piled over them . They are kept in the steam bath for a week or longer . In primitive society as in civilization the child has a status peculiar to those of its age grade and is not merely a small adult . With few exceptions savages are kind to children , humor them in almost every respect , and are never tyrannical . There has not been a need for a child-labor law in any primitive group , for the savage has never exploited his children , has never expected them to perform tasks beyond their ability or happiness , has never lived by their labor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ignorance , superstition , or a wrong understanding . He is interested in their education , which is begun at a very early age  --  sometimes immediately after birth  --  and , in the main , does the utmost for their welfare . The lot of the savage child is relatively much better than that of the savage adult . CHAPTER XXXI POSITION OF WOMAN " IF there be a word of truth in history , " wrote Macaulay a century ago , " women have always been , and still are , over the greater part of the globe , humble companions , playthings , captives , menials , beasts of burden . Except in a few happy and highly civilized communities , they are strictly in a state of personal slavery . Even in those countries where they are best treated , the laws are generally unfavorable to them , with respect to almost all the points in which they are most deeply interested . " The view that women are different from men in social or other qualities is widespread . The Chiquitos class everything as rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the Australian and Polynesian opinion that the flesh of women is preferable to that of men is a doubtful compliment to the fair sex . The recognition of social discrimination based on sex is as old as Plato , who decries it , and as Campanella and More , who , like many later writers of Utopias , have been concerned about the position of woman . Explanation of the existing social inequality is more recent . Montesquieu refers it to a " natural inequality between the sexes . " Another explanation is that the consequences of breaking sex moral laws are more dire in the case of women than in that of men , and more far-reaching discriminations are the result . Others , again , refer the harsher phases of woman 's subjection to man to conditions in the social or economic world , declaring that the degree of subjection is closely correlated with the intensity of such conditions . Whether or not woman 's position is inferior to that of man , everywhere it is different from that of man . A cleavage runs through virtually every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , slightly or emphatically In some areas they do not even eat together . At meal time the 369 // women in an Eskimo village form a circle apart from that of the men . Women do not partake of the dinner which successful hunters eat immediately after their arrival home with game , nor , on most occasions , do the women obtain their share of the food until after the men have eaten ; an exception being the concerted attack upon the frozen meat kept in the storerooms next to the hut . The feast of the Nenenots , who live adjacent to the Labrador Eskimos , and in many ways are like them , closes with an invitation to the women to participate ; they have been excluded from the feast , but now are allowed to partake of the remnants left by the noble males . Even among the Iroquois , who accord to some of the women of the tribe an exalted political status , the men generally appropriate most of the fresh meat and fish , consuming it in a succession of feasts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation may save a portion for the women of his family , but aside from this , women who stay in the village sometimes eat no fresh meat from one year 's end to another . At ordinary meals the men eat first and by themselves , the women and children later , by themselves . In South Australia the women get only the bones and fragments which the men leave after their repast . At Tana , in the New Hebrides , women and girls have their meals apart from the men , and do not drink the kava in which the men indulge . So among the Moors a separation at meal time is observed , the men eating first lest the women contaminate the food with the evil eye . A distinction in the foods eaten by the respective sexes is not uncommon . Thonga women eat only the flesh of animals having hoofs , not of those having paws ; Bangala women , and sometimes boys , but never men , eat the sweet potato . At Port Lincoln , Australia , the male of an animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , young animals for children . Two species of bandicoot are tabu to young women , the eating of which will produce premature menses . Iguanas and lizards are proper food for girls , accelerating maturity ; snakes are proper food for women , promoting fecundity . At Encounter Bay the roe of fish belong to the old men . Should // women , young men , or children , eat of them , they would become prematurely old . A species of fish abundant at certain seasons must be brought to the men , by whom they are cooked ; women and children are not allowed even to approach the fires until , the cooking is finished and the fish are cold . Then they may eat the fragments left by the men . The contagion of woman 's inherent uncleanness is one reason for the food tabus , while another is the monopoly of the better foods which the men reserve to themselves . A feeling of appropriateness , connected often with magical influences , is another source of the tabus , as , for example , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Separate habitations for the sexes also are found . Among the Nagas of Assam two large houses are set apart , one as a sleeping-place for unmarried men , another for unmarried women . The Igorots of the Philippines have special huts for unmarried girls , and the men 's council hut is forbidden to women . A village house for the exclusive use of men is found in New Guinea and in many parts of the Melanesian and Papuan area . Among the Chinyanja of Central Africa young unmarried girls occupy a special hut ; in the camp is a bwalo , an open space , where the women pound the meal and do other work . In the wigwams and tipis of North America a special place is assigned to women and another portion of the habitation to men . As a rule the man has the place opposite the door and behind the fire , the least disturbed by draughts , the most comfortable and cozy . In the Australian camp and family circle men and women have their respective quarters . Africa abounds with such distinctions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation of women and children from the adult male population . At Tana , except during a marriage feast or other public festival , women are not allowed on the marum , the place used for public meetings . The south side of the island of Savaii is called the side of the women ; the north side , the side of the men . The natives of the near-by De Peyster 's Island aver that at death a man goes to his family , a woman to hers . // From sacred precincts women usually are excluded . This as true of the temple areas in Polynesia as of those among he Hebrews . The paths along which the Toda sacred bufaloes go when approaching or leaving the village may not be raversed by women or girls . When going to the dairy to eceive milk , women must take special paths and avoid those ised by the dairyman . They may not go to the dairy nor to other places connected with it , except at the time appointed o receive buttermilk from the dairyman . While the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms of the dairy hut , women may not go beyond the outer room , although men may ' titer the middle room , only the dairyman being permitted to ) enetrate to the innermost room . The family house is divided into two portions , the division being indicated by a hole in he floor ; only into the portion behind this division may the women go , their activities being limited to that part of the muse . In primitive life the voice of woman sometimes is heard n the councils of the tribe , often in times and places where we least expect it . In the warlike Iroquois League of the Five Nations three of the councilors of the gens were women . the women councilors nominated the sachem , or head chief 3f the gens . The women 's council was held prior to and apart From that of the men . They then reported their decision to the council of old men , who passed final judgment . Any woman might come to the tribal council and express an opinion . The council of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four women councilors chosen by the female heads of households . Four-fifths of the council were women . Among the warlike Maoris , women exercised great influence over the tribe , especially the widows of important chiefs and old women , some of whom possessed powers of sorcery . One might amplify such instances as the above , but they would still remain the outstanding exceptions of savagery rather than traits which characterize the status of woman in the political realm . Yet woman is not devoid of social privileges or of particiPOSITION // pation in family affairs and in the larger social life . Usually she is the head in matters pertaining to the hut or household . Among the North American Indians the wife usually is consulted and her advice taken in matters concerning her , the family , or family possessions . Seldom will a man sell his own property without first consulting his wife , and almost never will he dispose of hers except at her bidding . Yet in general the position of woman in the community life is a subordinate one , a subordination shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been frequently noted that among North American Indians , when on the march , women are assigned a position behind the men and carry the burdens . This is true generally of primitive peoples . But one might easily draw the wrong inference that this indicates subjection , even humiliation . As a matter of fact it is imposed by the conditions of savage life . How would the men he able to protect the party from the enemy , or take advantage of the presence of game , unless they were to the fore and free of burdens , which in consequence fall to the women ? It must be admitted , however , that on peaceful expeditions as well , where attack is not feared and game is not anticipated , the women are similarly burdened . If woman 's activities in the ceremonial life are taken as a gauge of her larger social activities , hers is a narrowly restricted sphere . In Africa women generally are excluded from ceremonial life . Among the Yorubas women on penalty of death must keep within doors during the Oro celebrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though they know the statements of the men are false . In Ondo , where this annual festival lasts for three lunar months , women are obliged to remain within the house from daybreak till noon , while the men parade the streets , whirling the bullroarer , dancing , singing , and beating drums , killing stray dogs and fowls , on which latter they afterward feast . In some parts of Africa , however , the women play an important part in certain ceremonials . The Thongas may not move from one village site to another until a certain old woman is ready to lead the migration and by her presence fortify the new location . // From North America there is a varied story . In many of the ceremonial organizations of the Plains area women are allowed to participate , even , in some cases , to be officers . From some ceremonial organizations they are excluded . In the Osage and other tribes are societies whose membership is restricted to women . From most of the ceremonial performances of the Southwest they are excluded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally , the Takelmatabu excluding women from the periodic tribal ceremonies is probably representative rather than exceptional . Among the Samoyeds , when a shaman is making his indispensable tambourine , his wife , because per se she has a taint of uncleanness , must keep away ; among the Lopars , no woman may touch a shaman 's tambourine . Some tribes express no preference for men or women as manipulators of magic , while others show a decided preference for one or the other sex . Among the Smith Sound Es-kimos , women as well as men are angakut , though the Eskimos declare the former rarely are dangerous , since they lack the courage to do evil . The Iroquois put to death , under the charge of using evil magic , both men and women . Among the Takelmas no distinction is observed between male and female shamans , neither sex being supposed more efficient than the other . Often there was ready co-operation between the sexes . If the shaman treating the sick person was a woman , her husband began the ceremony with a song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a man , his wife assisted in similar manner . In practically every North American tribe both men and women possessed magic power . Yakut female shamans are inferior to male shamans except as regards mental diseases , a phase of practice in which women excel . A woman is called in only when no male shaman is procurable . The most frequent employment of female shamans is to foretell the future , or to find the location of things lost or stolen . Female shamans are found also among the Tungus , Samoyeds , Ostyaks , Buryats , Altaians , and Chuvashs . Among the Botyaks they ply their trade unPOSITION // hindered by any prohibition save one which denies them the position of chief shaman . The Kamchadal have no special male shamans , their place being taken by women specially gifted for the undertaking . Often old women are thus gifted , able to call up spirits and appropriate their services . In primitive society a father is not always a necessity and ceremonial mothers may take the place of actual ones . At the court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she may be twenty years his junior . " The King 's actual parent is now alive ; when she departs , he must supply her place by selection . For each monarch in the dynasty there is an old woman mother . The mothers ' of high officials have corresponding honors . For instance , the she-Min-gau is popularly called the he-Min-gau 's mother . ' Many have two mothers , ' an old one for the last , and a young one for the present , reign . Visitors communicate with the mothers ' of their respective nations . Mothers ' is the official title of the Amazons '  --  hence the custom . " 1 In Ashantee the queen mother exercises considerable power in affairs of state , though the wives of the king have no power . The Yoruba mother cherishes her child and refuses comfort until the lost one is restored to her . In a Yoruba tale the mother refuses to receive any offerings , however lavish , in lieu of her child whom the araurau bird has carried off . No stigma attaches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egbas , attribute barrenness to had health . Australian mothers rejoice to the point of tears at meeting a daughter from whom they have long been separated and attachment of mothers to their children is marked . Angas says the women of New South Wales take great pride in making their children attractive in appearance , whereas Collins , not altogether inconsistently declares : " Never were women so inattentive as these . We often heard of children being injured by fire , while the mother lay fast asleep beside them , these people being extremely difficult to awaken when once asleep . " Barrenness is looked upon with disfavor by primitive // peoples , as by most of the peoples of the older civilizations  - -  for example , the Hebrews . The Eskimos of the Ungava district apply a term of contempt to the mother who bears only female children , and Rasmussen has said of the Greenland Eskimos that the only women who aroused his pity were the barren . The souls of women who die in childbirth go to the lowest place , but this lowest place corresponds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the souls of such women go to the upper world , which is the " heaven " in this locality . Eskimo women are not prolific and many are barren . A woman is seldom a mother before the age of twenty . The Wyandot mother is the recipient of presents from the prospective son-in-law ; to her house the groom goes after marriage , there to take up his abode at least for a while . The Iroquois mother and her relations control the children , give them their names , raise them , attend to their marriages and funerals , adopt strangers  --  in short , manage the general activities of the household . The Osages , it is said , frequently kill the mothers of twins , but if so in this respect they are unique among American tribes . From her mother the young wife receives instructions about the tabus to be observed during pregnancy , that no misfortune befall the child through carelessness of the expectant mother . Frequently the mother assists at the parturitions of her daughter . When on the eve of delivery the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . The treatment of women must be considered in the light of the prevailing moral ideas and the enlightenment of a people . By this test the primitive woman is usually as well off , relatively , as are her European sisters . True , she sometimes has a hard lot . But so , sometimes , do the men . If she works hard at home , they frequently undergo great hardships in the hunt for game and encounter dangers in the pursuit of war . The ordinary visitor to a savage comrnunity sees the women at work , but does not witness the hardships of the men . Even so , it is true that the world of savagery , as much perhaps as the world of civilization , is a man-made world , and // woman is subject to the power of the male . Undoubtedly the male has used might in determining the issues of right , and woman has had to accept his decisions . CHAPTER XXXII BIRTH RITES FESTIVITY and ceremony are features of every savage community , whether it be otherwise a placid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crises of life and death are met in ceremonial and formal manner . Birth , a phenomenon of mystery , is fraught with dangers of various complexion . The event is a test of the mettle of the savage , a strain upon the nerves , and resource is had to social measures as well as to the realm of the occult . If we are to believe Herodotus  --  and we can not always do so  --  " The Trusis have also this custom : When a child is born , its kinsfolk sit around about it , and lament for all the evils that it must endure now that it is born into the world , recounting all the troubles of human life . But a dead man they bury with much laughter and joy , for they say that he bath been delivered from all manner of unhappiness and is now in great joy and felicity . " Such is not the custom of any tribe known to the ethnographer . Almost always birth is regarded as a crisis  --  for the infant , for the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of birth , and numerous precautions must be taken to protect those concerned . As a prophylactic against two specific diseases the Chinyanjas steam the infant . This done , the dung floor of the hut is renewed , and baskets , potsherds , spoons , everything which was in the hut during the mother 's accouchement , is burned . The fire is raked up and the ashes removed ; when the mkuzi belt is placed around the infant 's wrist , the fire is extinguished and rekindled from that of some other hut . The father comes and stands near the doorway . Men make two incisions along each of his legs , four small slashes on his chest , and two on his back . Into these they rub a medicine which will protect 378 // him from a disease in the legs known as chinyalo , which otherwise he would be liable to contract should he step over the place on the veranda where the umbilical cord and the afterbirth are buried . To the old women who place the child in the arms of the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he makes a present of beads . Among the Yorubas , seven days after birth , if the child be a girl , nine days , if a boy , the priest or medicine-man comes and sacrifices a cock and a hen to Ifa and Olori , the spirits which dwell in the head of the child ; after which , in order to prevent Elegba from interfering with mother and child , the entrails of the two sacrifices are sprinkled with palm wine and are taken outside of the house and placed before his image . The water which stands in the earthen vessels placed in front of the images of the gods is brought to the house and thrown upon the thatched roof ; as it drips down from the eaves mother and child pass three times through the falling drops  --  a purification . The medicine-man next takes the water of purification with which he bathes the head of the child , repeating three times the name by which the infant is to be known , then holds him so that his feet touch the ground  - -  thus initiating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When these ceremonies have been performed the fire is extinguished and the embers are carried away ; the house is carefully swept , live coals are brought , and a fresh fire is lighted . When the new fire has been kindled another sacrifice of fowls is made to Ifa , and the ceremonies are complete . In the Fjort people collect around a woman in childbirth and fire off guns to ease delivery . She is attended by her mother and other female relations . The child is washed , sometimes in palm wine , by the attendants , and the mother is given a hot bath . Among the Euhalayis of Australia the arrival of the child is facilitated by entreating chants delivered by the grandmother or other female relation : " Come now , here 's your aunt waiting to see you ! " " Here 's your sister ! " " Make haste , the fruit is ripe . The flowers are blooming . The grass // is waving high . The birds are all talking . And it is a beautiful place , hurry and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after giving birth to a child the Kachari mother is unclean and subject to certain restrictions . She may not approach the domestic altar commonly found inside of a Kachari 's house , on which ordinarily she offers eggs , chickens , etc. , in time of trouble . The use of a " water of peace " terminates the tabus . With this water the priest sprinkles freely the mother as well as the house and its contents , after which the mother is at liberty to resume social intercourse with neighbors . Not infrequently numerous tabus are imposed upon the father , infraction of which brings misfortune to mother or child . After the birth of a child the Mandan father may not bridle a horse , that is , may not fasten a lariat to the lower jaw of a horse , for if he does so the infant will die in convulsions . For five or six days after the birth of a child the Yurok father eats apart , touches neither meat nor fresh salmon , and instead of water drinks thin acorn soup . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it has been a stillbirth , for sixty days , she remaining meanwhile in a separate hut . The Yuki mother of a new-born child eats apart , though she is not compelled to leave the house . Among the Northern Maidus a tabu rested upon both parents for a ten-day period following the birth of the child , the father occupying the seclusion hut with the mother . In the mountain districts occupied by these tribes the parents fasted and rested until the remnant of the umbilical cord fell from the child . Following the birth of a child the Yokuts parents ate no meat or hard food , neither did they cook , hunt , work , or touch tools . The tabu might apply for several months , or until the remnant of the navel cord dropped off . The Mohave mother ate neither salt nor flesh for a month after the birth of the child , during which time both she and the father refrained from smoking . When a child is about to be born the Teton Dakotas set up a pole inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the top , as at the puberty ceremonies . Soon after its . birth they paint a certain pattern in vermilion on the face of the child ; if they neglect to do this the infant becomes blear-eyed or falls sick . When the navel string is severed , they make a small bag of deer-skin , cut in the shape of a tortoise , and in this , along with sweet-smelling leaves , place a piece of the navel string . The infant carries this bag on its back . A part of the navel string is buried . When a child is mischievous the people say : " He is hunting his navel string . " The custom of preserving the navel string is common to much of the Plains area , is found in northern California , over the greater part of Africa , in many Australian tribes , and among the peasantry in Europe . The umbilical cord of a Yurok child is severed carefully and preserved in the house for about a year . When the time has come to wean the child the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge , where he splits a young living fir , inserts the cord , and binds the sapling together so that the tree will hold it . When he returns after performing this duty the child receives the first food other than milk . The Yukis carefully keep the child 's navel string , which they lay in a wet skin or rag that is squeezed over the body of the child should it be ill . The Shastas burn the umbilical cord or carefully wrap it and secrete it at a distance from habitations . As among Plains tribes , the mountain Maidus tied the umbilical cord to the child 's cradle . The Chukchansis buried the cord , though the Tachis attached it to the child , who wore it over the abdomen . One of the most interesting customs in connection with childbirth is the couvade . Couvade is the custom of the father taking to bed and behaving as if he had given birth to the child . Conversely , in most cases the mother takes care of the household as usual , providing the food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband . It is possibly referred to in the old French poem of " Aucassin and Nicolette , " delightfully translated by Andrew Lang . It flourishes among several tribes in British Guiana and in the Dutch East Indies . By Bachofen , Tylor , and others , couvade has been interpreted as a record of transition from matrilineal to patri382 BIRTH RITES lineal descent , a view strengthened by the fact that it is found only in patrilineal tribes or in those which show indications of passing from matrilineal to patrilineal descent . At the same time it is almost always closely bound up with the idea that the actions of the father greatly influence the child . The father may not hunt , for the spirit of the child might accompany him and lose its way or suffer injury . He may not cut with a sharp instrument , for fear of injuring the spirit of the child . Most of the tabus upon his action are inspired by , or at least are supported by , the belief that the fate of the child is at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This philosophy , no doubt , turns attention to the importance of the father and paves the way to the patrilineal descent which Bachofen and Tylor infer is the cause and not the effect of couvade . However that may be , childbirth is a time of tabus Bich affect a great many people . Usually delivery is in seclusion . The Australian woman goes apart in the bush with an old woman who acts as assistant ; the African woman is alone in the hut with the nurse ; if the mother does not leave the house and the family remain , she is placed apart to herself . But most stringent is the tabu upon the presence of the father . Seldom is he allowed to be present , and not infrequently , as in the Plains area of North America and in some African tribes , he may not see the child until the latter is at least a few days old . The philosophy which lies back of these tabus upon the father is a matter of conjecture . The tabu often applies to the child as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor into the presence of other people , until it is at least a few days old . The underlying idea is the danger inherent in childbirth , which is regarded as mysterious and uncanny . It is best to be on the safe side and avoid undue risks . The use of magic is frequent . Many magical ceremonies insure the mother an easy , delivery . Not infrequently this involves certain behavior upon the part of the father , whose conduct has much to do with the delivery of the child . Thus the Australian father walks rapidly to and fro not far from // the place of accouchement , that the child may be inclined to come into the world quickly . Many magical acts are designed to secure good fortune for the child . This , too , involves primarily conduct upon the part of the mother and the father . Often the medicine-man helps to insure success for the future hunter or housewife . Amulets are placed upon the child , or substances containing magical virtues are brought into apposition with it . The Chilkats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolf , so that the child will be a good hunter when he grows up and will have a nose for game as keen as that of the wolf . Widely spread is the view that the child at birth is not a member of the society of living beings , or at least is not a member of the tribe and must be admitted into it . Admission into the tribal circle is symbolized and is accomplished by the visits of friends , by formal recognition of the child by the father , by presentation to a " god " or " power , " by ceremonies of admission into the tribe , and by formal admission into the religious cult . The latter , in the form of baptism , still plays a large part in many branches of Christianity , as well as in other religions . During the first five or six days of its life the Yurok child may not take nourishment , for should it do so its jaws would be affected and it would soon starve . Meanwhile it is given a little water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the liquid having a milky appearance . Childbirth removes from the social circle those immediately affected , and often it is necessary to readmit the parents . To accomplish this there is a rite or ceremony , frequently with magical accompaniments , through which the re-entry of the parents to everyday life is made possible . Since at birth the Omaha child is not a member of the tribe , nor even of the group of beings living on the earth , it is necessary to induct it into the world so that it can cope successfully with the difficulties which beset it on every side . Announcement cards are not sent to friends , but there is a ceremonial announcement , an introduction to both the tribe and the universe . The ceremony of introduction is held the eighth day after birth . The medicine-man upon whom , this // duty falls , stations himself at the door of the tipi in which the child lies , raises his right hand toward the sky , palm outward , and intones the following in a loud , ringing voice : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ye that move in the heavens , I bid you hear me ! Into your midst has come a new life . Consent ye , I implore ! Make its path smooth , that it may reach the brow of the first hill ! " Ho ! Ye Winds , Clouds , Rain , 1'Iist , all ye that move in the air , I bid you hear me ! Into your midst has come a new life . Consent ye , I implore ! Make its path smooth , that it may reach the brow of the second hill ! " Ho ! Ye Hills , Valleys , Rivers , Lakes , Trees , Grasses , all ye of the earth , I bid you hear me ! Into your midst has come a new life . Consent ye , I implore ! Make its path smooth , that it may reach the brow of the third hill ! " Ho ! Ye Birds , great and small , that fly up in the air , Ho ! Ye Animals , great and small , that dwell in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasses and burrow in the ground  - -  I hid you hear me ! Into your midst has come a new life . Consent ye , I implore ! Make its path smooth , that it may reach the brow of the fourth hill ! " Ho ! All ye of the heavens , all ye of the air , all ye of the earth : I bid you all to hear me ! Into your midst has come a new life . Consent ye , consent ye all , I implore ! Make its path smooth  --  then shall it travel beyond the four hills ! " The Hopi baby is washed and dressed by the paternal grandmother or one of her sisters , the woman making four marks with corn meal on the four walls of the room on the day of its birth . One of these she erases on the fifth , a second on the tenth , a third on the fifteenth , and the last of them on the twentieth day of the child 's life . On each of these days the head of the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the purifactory solvent of the Southwest . The twentieth day marks the end of the lying-in period for the // mother ; then the grandmother comes early in the morning , bathes the child , and puts corn meal on its lips , accompanying this act with a prayer that the child may reach an old age , then giving it a name . Women who are members of the father 's clan come in , one at a time , bathe the child , and bestow additional names  --  for the child shall not suffer from paucity of names . The paternal grandmother then goes with mother and child to the eastern edge of the mesa , arriving there about sunrise , taking with her the two ears of white corn which have lain near the child during the twenty days of its life on earth . After placing the ears of corn on the child 's breast , the grandmother waves them toward the east , then strews corn meal toward the sun , and places some on the child 's mouth . These rites are accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have been bestowed upon the newcomer . Then the mother goes through a similar ceremony , uttering a similar prayer . Thus the child is introduced to the sun and to the tribal food . Birth , then , is a crisis . It is a crisis in the life of the newborn child and in the lives of parents . It is dangerous , mysterious , uncanny , and must be treated accordingly . Above all , one must see to it that the new arrival is properly introduced . to the world of things and of men in which he is to live a life patterned after that of the members of his group . CHAPTER XXXIII MARRIAGE RITES MARRIAGE is one of the crises of life and must be celebrated with appropriate rites . Its purpose is to unite the couple in lifelong intimacy and cement the tie which shall bind thern together " for better or for worse . " It also establishes new relations within the social group , and it is important that its members be apprised of them . Hence marriage is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its celebration is almost always a social rite , usually tribal in nature , though sometimes regarded as a matter concerning only the kin of bride and bridegroom . Sometimes the selection of wives lies largely in the hands of the old men , who , as in Australia , may appropriate the younger women , assigning to the young men the old women whom they have discarded . The Euahlayis say these young men were in love with said old women when the former were previously on earth , but that the lads died before passing through the initiation ceremony and so could not marry until a later incarnation . Thus do vested interests justify themselves by far-fetched explanations . Decisions about marriage are usually made by the fathers of the parties concerned , though sometimes the mothers arrange it . Among the Maoris , however , the marriage is arranged by the brothers of the bride , the girl 's parents having little to do with it . Her relations prepare the house in which she is to live and conduct the bridegroom to it . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife for him when he has attained the age of fifteen to twenty , and then endeavor to raise the stipulated bride price . They visit the parents of the prospective bride , present them with various articles , such as rice , liquor , betel nuts , and formally ask the daughter 's hand for their son . If the girl 's parents 386 // accept the proffered articles this signifies that the proposal is looked upon with favor . Elders or leading men of the village who are present witness the marriage contract . But individual choice is not always negligible . Kachari young people sometimes take the matter into their own hands . Such a marriage , though irregular , is valid . The bride 's parents claim from the bridegroom a marriage portion larger than usual , and , if their demands are complied with , there is seldom further objection to the union . Or , if the regular proceedings have been gone through and the bridegroom 's parents are unable to pay the stipulated bride price , the young man may offer his personal services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospective bridegroom may sever all connection with his family and identify himself completely with that of his bride , in whose house he serves until the death of her parents . Then he shares equally with his wife in their property , though he retains no claim to that of his parents or other relations . So in other parts of the world in which one 's mate is chosen for one , the boy or the girl may defy authority and choose a partner of his or her own liking . Hopi young folks themselves arrange their marriages . If the young couple have made up their minds , and the young man has acquired property , the parents of the two are informed of the decision . The mother of the girl accompanies her to the house of the young man , carrying a tray of corn meal , which she presents to his mother , and then returns home . The girl , however , remains and grinds corn for three days . On the fourth day the relations of the couple assemble at the bridegroom 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yucca suds . With one of these the mother of the girl washes the boy 's head , while with the other the boy 's mother washes the girl 's head , other female relations assisting in rinsing the suds from their hair . This completes the marriage ritual . In Australia betrothal commonly takes place at an early age , independently of the consent of the girl , perhaps without the consent of the boy . In the Kunandaburi tribe female infants are betrothed by parents to men , or to boys , who claim // them when the girls arrive at the age of puberty , or before . In the Larrekeya and the Wogaits tribes girls are given to men at an early age . Lumholz suspected , among the natives at the Herbert River , the existence of regulations by which girls , from time of birth , are betrothed . Infant betrothal is common among most of the Kamilaroi tribes . In the Geawegal , marriage was ordinarily by gift of the girl and by consent of the respective fathers , in case the future husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the time for marriage . Thus , girls in childhood commonly were affianced to men much older than themselves . In West Australia two friends agree that if the first child of the one be a girl she shall become the wife of the other . If the friend who benefits by this arrangement has seven sons , the eighth child being a girl , she will be the wife of her father 's said friend . When she has arrived at the age of marriage , the New South Wales girl , who is betrothed when very young , is taken to the camp of the future husband , her mother forearming her with a yam stick and providing her with a bag in which to carry her possessions . In southwestern Victoria , a man who desires a girl in marriage does not always con ult her wishes nor procure her consent , but makes his proposal to her father through her uncles or her cousins . If the father approves , he informs the suitor . To this decision , whether she admires the man or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their respective mothers with the concurrence of the brothers of the mothers , the respective fathers , as also in other New South Wales tribes , having no part in the arrangement . In Central Australia , the common method of getting a wife is by arrangement with the brothers or fathers of the man and those of the woman . In the Wotjobaluk , the father of the bride takes the girl to the camp of the bridegroom . At about ten paces from the camp they sit down , the father 's sister saying to her : " That is your husband ; he will give you food ; you must stop with him . " " Capture " seldom is employed in the Central tribes , though it is common on the Herbert River . // Marriage by " capture " is common in W s.t , Australia , though the woman who submits usually fares badly . Among the Kurnais , elopement was the common way of obtaining a wife , though capture was sometimes resorted to , and , less frequently , exchange or gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of securing a wife , though we are not informed as to relative frequency . Elopement is possible only through concurrence of the girl , and seems to involve keeping knowledge of the plans from the girl 's parents . In Gippsland marriage by agreement was the rule , pursuit and capture being feigned . In Australia choice of a partner is influenced by at least two considerations : the personal attractions and the personal worth of the suitor . If a woman is " good-looking , " all the men want her ; she generally goes to the strongest and most influential , and may change husbands many times during the course of a lifetime , even contrary to her wishes . SYMBOLISM IN MARRIAGE RITES Frequently the celebration of marriage is designed to establish by magic an intimate bond between bride and groom . Among the Maoris the wlzaha-nzoe , or sleeping together , constitutes the marriage rite . In Indonesia a portion of the marriage ceremony consists in the bride and bridegroom eating rice or chewing betel together . Among the Jagir Duseens , of North Borneo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feast , in the presence of the two families , the rite consisting of transferring a drop of blood from a small incision made with a wooden knife in the calf of the man 's leg to a similar incision in the woman 's leg . Drinking together consummates the Ainu marriage . The Kacharis gather for a feast at the house of the bride , the food and drink for the occasion being provided by the bridegroom and his relations . When the wedding feast is prepared , the village elders sit in front , the younger people behind , each guest supplied with a brass plate or with a plantain leaf . On these plates the bride places rice and curry , serving the elders first . When all have been provided for , she makes obeisance , and may kneel in // their midst for their sanction , the bridegroom , if present , kneeling with her . Thereupon one of the village elders makes a short address on the obligations of the married state , at the conclusion of which he wishes every blessing for the newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the response from the assembly . The Ahom Chutiyas observe a form of marriage known as chaklang . This consists of an interchange of presents between bride and bridegroom , after which they formally inhale the fragrance of turmeric together . This is followed by the tying of the nuptial knot and the distribution of simple refreshments among assembled friends and relations . " With the Hindu Chutiyas there is a still more elaborate ceremonial in vogue , one which approximates somewhat closely to the orthodox Hindu ideal . The chaklang form is superseded by that of the horn  --  i.e. , libations of clarified butter ( ghi ) are formally poured in sacrifice on the sacred fire , and certain special mantras are recited by the officiating priest in the presence of the bride and bridegroom , who are formally seated by his side , and formally united by the tying of the nuptial knot . It is said , further , that matrimonial etiquette requires postponement of consummation of the marriage for a week or so after the completion of the wedding ceremonial . " i In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclosure is formed by planting a plantain tree at each corner , and within this inclosure are placed sixteen lighted lamps and sixteen earthenware pots full of water , the bridegroom taking his stand in their midst . The bride then formally walks around him seven times , and then finally takes a seat at his left side , her face turned toward the east . No mantras are recited nor is any Brahmin present , but some village elder sprinkles water over the couple from one of the water pots and the ceremony is held to be complete . " 2 The Dyak bride and bridegroom are placed face to face on a copper tray , on which they sit holding each other by the hand . An old man smears the hand of the bridegroom with // blood , then the hand of the bride . The following morning bride and bridegroom bathe together . The magic underlying these ' rites is reflected in the prohibition that previous to the marriage ceremony the betrothed couple may not eat off the same plate nor take betel and sirih from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without sufficient justification , as survivals of marriage by capture . Occasionally the Moran bridegroom carries off his bride by force , especially during the April festivities , such a marriage being afterward recognized by the girl 's parents . The Ahom Chutiya bridegroom carries off his bride through a hole cut in the corner of the house . In Southeast Asia there are ceremonial abductions of the bride , or a sham fight between the relations of the bridegroom and those of the bride , in which , of course , the latter have the worst . of it and the bride is secured and carried off . Similar customs survive among the Slays , and the Roman custom which prescribed that the bridegroom should carry the bride over the threshold is by some interpreted as a survival of an earlier marriage by capture  - -  as is the story of the rape of the Sabines . It is doubtful , however , whether these customs are survivals of marriage by capture . Probably they have their origin in a real or assumed reluctance of the bride , which is thus ceremonially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is general throughout South Africa , the price of a bride being reckoned in cows or oxen , the act of living together constituting the marriage ceremony . The Wa-Langulu bridegroom must pay to his father-in-law a marriage fee of a tusk of " male " ivory weighing about seventy pounds , and to his mother-in-law a cow tusk . A peculiar form of satire and insult is given by Thonga relatives to the bride and bridegroom . The women who take the bride to her husband on the wedding day sing this song : " Let us go with her , but let us go back to our homes ! " the insinuation being , " She is going to find trouble ; we wo n't follow her as far as that ! " The Mandingo intended bride brings her intended groom a // little water in a calabash , and kneeling down before him desires to wash his hands . " When he had done this , the girl , with a tear of joy sparkling in her eyes , drank the water  - -  this being considered the greatest proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mungo Park gives the following description of a wedding ceremony among this people : " In the evening the tabala , or large drum , was beat to announce a wedding , which was held at one of the neighboring tents . A great number of people of both sexes assembled , but without that mirth and hilarity which takes place at a negro wedding : here was neither singing nor dancing , nor any other amusement that I could perceive . A woman was beating the drum , and the other women joining at times like a chorus , by setting up a shrill scream , and at the same time moving their tongues from one side of the mouth to the other with great celerity . The wedding drum continued to beat , and the women to sing , or rather whistle , all night . About nine in the morning the bride was brought in state from her mother 's tent , attended by a number of women who carried her tent ( a present from the husband ) , some bearing up the poles , others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched , whistling as formerly , until they came to the place appointed for her residence , where they pitched the tent . The husband followed , with a number of men leading four bullocks , which they tied to the tent strings ; and having killed another and distributed the beef among the people , the ceremony was concluded . " 1 On the Gold Coast a girl about to be married was taken first to a certain rock , thence to her husband 's home . An offering of rum was poured into a hole in the rock and a piece or pieces of white cloth laid upon it . This was believed to promote peace in the household of the future wife and also to guarantee a safe recovery from the dangers attendant upon maternity . Among the Wishrams , the father of the boy arranges for the " purchase " of the bride , paying , perhaps , slaves and horses . The father of the bride may send to the father of // the groom , as if in exchange , ox-hide or other blankets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bridegroom meet the bride at her house , and the father of the groom escorts the latter . He lives with his wife 's people for a while , later he and his wife taking up their abode in his father 's house . Among the Takelmas a girl was purchased ( with dentalia ) from her father by the father of the prospective groom , and was taken to her future husband by the respective fathers . This might happen in spite of the fact that neither partner to the marriage was pleasing to the other . Among the Yanas the prospective groom said to his promised bride : " I will give you as food whatever I hunt . I shall not whip you . You on your part shall not scold me . " To this the bride made reply : " If I have a child we shall go off to your house . Stay now in my house . " His reply was : " Yes , I will stay in your house . Now I shall go out hunting . " To which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps it will be I who shall die first , perhaps it will be you . " Sometimes the mother compelled the daughter to marry a certain man because he was recognized as a good hunter and would be a good provider for his mother-in-law , in whose house he was to live . Among the Osages , when a match has been decided upon , the two families palaver over the price of the girl . When the price has been decided upon it is made public by announcement . At a subsequent meeting the horse and property to be given in payment are brought by the man 's family and divided among the members of the girl 's family . Thereupon they settle upon a day for the marriage . When the day arrives the girl , " dressed in her best finery and armed with a gun , is mounted on a pony and is brought toward her prospective husband and his family until within a short distance . Suddenly she fires the gun and dashes off as if to escape . The bridegroom 's family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone tries to be the first to seize her . The first to reach her , if a man , gets her horse ; the second , the gun . If a woman be first , she gets the bride 's finery and outer clothes ; the second woman gets what is left . The bride when caught is // brought to the lodge of the groom 's family . Here the couple dine together and the two families exchange presents . During the ensuing night the couple sleep together in the groom 's lodge . The next morning they are escorted to the bride 's mother 's lodge . A fine horse is then presented to the girl 's brother by the family of the groom . " After the planting of the corn the Sacs and Fox hold a crane dance in which the women dress in their best , decorated with feathers . At this feast the young man selects the young woman whom he wishes for wife . The brave informs his mother , who calls on the mother of the girl . If arrangements are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lodge . " He goes to the lodge when all are asleep ( or pretend to be ) , lights his matches , which have been provided for the purpose , and soon finds where his intended sleeps . He then awakens her , and holds the light to his face that she may know him  --  after which he places the light close to her . If she blows it out , the ceremony is ended and he appears in the lodge next morning as one of the family . If she does not blow out the light but leaves it to burn out , he retires from the lodge . The next day he places himself in full view of it and plays his flute . The young women go out , one by one , to see who he is playing for . The tune changes , to let them know that he is not playing for them . When his intended makes her appearance at the door , he continues his courting tune until she returns to the lodge . He then gives over playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out favorable . " When a Northern Saulteaux wished to marry a girl he asked her father for her . " If the father approved , an interview was appointed for which the lover prepared by taking a sweat bath . He then came into her presence and sat on the ground , smoking a pipe . As he smoked , he took one hundred small pieces of wood about an inch in length and threw them at her , one by one . She tried to catch these in a hark bowl , and for everyone which she caught her lover had to make a present to her father , these presents being considered as pay- // ment for the daughter . The young man then gave a feast to which the entire family was invited . After the feast they danced and sang their war songs . Presents were exchanged between the lover and the relations of the young woman . The father then covered the lovers with a beaver robe and gave them a new gun and canoe . " ' The woman went to live in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , her oldest brother-in-law gave her in marriage ; if there was no brother-in-law , this right fell to the oldest brother . Polygamy was common . Earlier theories of marriage were concerned largely with matters of presumed origin and development . Lewis H. Morgan thought that man had started out like many of the animals , in promiscuity , then had developed a group marriage , in which a number of men were husbands of a number of women . This , in turn , was presumed to have given place to a plurality of husbands , polyandry , which was followed by a plurality of wives , polygyny , the final stage being that of monogamy , which prevails in the higher civilizations . For a time it was thought that certain Australian tribes practiced occasionally the promiscuity which Morgan had surmised to be the original condition of mankind . Moreover , he thought he had discovered group marriage in Polynesia . But we know no tribes which practice promiscuity , and the partial lapse into it which is sometimes apparent is probably to be interpreted otherwise than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certain , too , that the presumed group marriage did not exist in Polynesia . Morgan misinterpreted the significance of the customs which he thought indicative of that practice . Polyandry , polygyny , and monogamy are the only forms of marriage which we know actually existed . The interpretation of the levirate , the requirement in Leviticus that a man marry his brother 's childless widow , is not evidence of a survival of polyandry . Its motive was the desire that the deceased might , if only by fiction , have issue  - -  as is clearly expressed in the Biblical injunction . On the other // hand , Morgan was correct in inferring that polygyny tends to give place to monogamy as a culture attains a higher development , though monogamy prevails in most primitive cultures . It is sometimes stated that each form of marriage ceremony represents a stage in a unilinear evolution of that institution . But this can not be proved , nor is it probable that such is the case . Rather it is probable that the institution has developed in different directions in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage rites of widely separated tribes is due to similarity of psychological conditions . In other cases the form of marriage has spread from one region to another . Each problem must be considered on its own merits by the logic applicable to such instances . CHAPTER XXXIV DEATH RITES " Although dead they live in our memory and will live in the memory of times to Come . "  --  BENEDETTO CROCE . " The dead have no life but that which the living lend them . "  --  SIR THOMAS BROWNE . OF burial customs in Paleolithic times there is no evidence beyond the suggestion that orientation , laying the head in the direction of a certain point of the compass ; probably was employed and that man believed in survival of the soul . Some Paleolithic skeletons were covered with red ocher . From Neolithic times , however , there is considerable evidence . A Neolithic skeleton unearthed in northern Italy in 1884 , at a depth of over eight meters , was extended on the back , the head covered with red ocher . Three skeletons found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two lying on the left side , one on the back , two of them holding a flint knife in the left hand . Shell ornaments and red pigments accompany the burial . In another grave the bodies are wrapped in ornamented skins and are accompanied by flint implements . The grave is in a cave , possibly a former habitation of the deceased . In the caves of Tuscany the disturbed nature of the deposits leaves no evidence as to orientation . In the cave burials on the coast of Liguria , usually the body lies on the left side in contracted position , in some cases protected with a casing of rough stones and provided with considerable funeral furniture , usually including pieces of red ocher . The graves of infants and of young children are without the casing of stone , seldom containing much furniture . In some cases the body lies on the left side , legs contracted , left hand under the head , feet toward the sea . On the forehead of one skull there is a large irregular patch of red ocher. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead are mourned for according to the position they occupied in life , a favorite child often causing an alarming amount of grief in the mother , who mourns for many days , constantly bewailing her loss , reminding auditors of the excellent traits of the child which grief calls to mind . Among the Greenland Eskimos , if the deceased be a man , his team of dogs is slain and the dead dogs are harnessed to his sledge , which is placed by the grave . If the deceased be a woman , only one dog is killed . Among Labrador Eskimos as soon as death is certain the household sets up an unearthly wailing , the women tearing their hair , beating their breasts , and otherwise giving vent to grief . The virtues of the deceased are lauded and his vices forgotten . In come the villagers to add their contribution to the general woe . A watch is kept by two men during the night ; a man might he overcome by the ghost were he alone . Next day the body is taken out through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , and is buried . It is not taken out through the doorway lest the ghost find its way back . Unexpected death in a house is a great misfortune , for it pollutes everything in it . When the end of a man is approaching , his housemates remove the household furniture and the man 's possessions . A method of disposing of the dead suggesting that employed by the Wotjobaluk of southeastern Australia is in vogue among the Hudson Bay Eskimos . If the deceased is young his feet are placed in the direction of the rising sun , while those of the aged are pointed in the opposite direction . The Iglilirmiut Eskimos bury half-grown children with the feet toward the south , middle-aged persons with the feet toward the west . Boas believes the same methods of disposal were in vogue at Cumberland Sound , inasmuch as not all graves lie east and west . One is reminded of the custom among Christian peoples of burying the dead with the head to the east , and of Shakespeare 's lines in " Cymbeline " : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the east ; My father had a reason fo'ta custom to which Beaumont and Fletcher refer in The Faithful Shepherdess . Among Alaskan Eskimos the number and kind of articles attached to the coffin or strewn around it depend upon the wealth of the deceased , as to whose social position these things are silent witnesses . Among the Flathead Indians of Memaloose Island in the Columbia River a corpse is prepared for its last resting-place by a rude process of embalming . A species of berry is placed in eyes , nose , and mouth . As a protection from bugs and other insects pieces of snake-skin are tied around the head and to the trunk of the body . Blankets are then wound round the body , and silk handkerchiefs round the head , together with beads and wampum . The whole is securely sewed up in buckskin with leather thongs and carefully laid on the bare ground on a pile of dead bodies which has already been formed in one of the wooden inclosures . Old residents say that in former times the Indians did not scruple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest wife if he had more than one . They deposit with the body the deceased 's blankets , implements of war and of hunting , with whatever other personal effects can conveniently remain near the corpse . Among the Wishrams , when a woman died with unborn child the people mourned for five days . During this time they ate only in the morning , fasting during the remainder of the day . The reason given was their sorrow at the loss of the child . " Now suppose a man is dead . Then he is to be taken to the burial vault and deposited among the dead . Now he is being carried and very many people go following him , as the dead person is being carried . He is liked , his heart was good to everybody . Ten days and five days they mourn . So also in the case of a woman . Good was her heart and , when looked at , good her appearance . " " If a young man should die the people mourn . He is liked ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his body are tied on to him beads of sea-fish bones , sea-shell beads , round // glass beads , and strings of brass square-holed coins ( probably Chinese ) ; they are put around him on his body ( neck and arms ) . And then they mourn for ten days . Again , so also it is done if a virgin woman dies . If a virgin dies , there are put all over her woven cloth , round glass beads , sea-shell beads , fish-bone beads , and bracelets . Her mother cuts off her hair down to her ears . Again , so also her father just cuts off his head-hair . Again , so also all her relations . " The Wascos also cut the hair when in mourning . The Yanas wrapped up with the corpse various belongings  --  arrows , bows , and blankets . The brother of the dead man lay down in the grave and was then pulled out , being admonished , " Do not weep , you will soon follow him . " The women danced and cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpse . The dead man 's mother remained near the grave throughout the night . Pitch was daubed on the face as a sign of mourning . The house and the unburied belongings of the deceased were burned and the family moved to another locality . Every summer food was burned at the grave . Beads of various kinds were brought to the grave of the deceased and pounded there . The Yanas sometimes buried a man in the sweat-house when it was snowing severely , reburying him outside as soon as a favorable opportunity presented itself . After the process of burning the corpse of her husband the Tolkotin widow collects the larger bones , which she is obliged to carry for some years on her back . During this time she is treated as a slave . The Clallams and Twanas begin the mourning as soon as a death occurs , the most arduous mourning duties falling to the women . Among the Twanas the mother of the deceased sings the mourning song , others occasionally joining , repeating the words : " My son ( or daughter ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair . About nine months after the death there is a potlatch at which each clan is represented by a delegation of two or three men who bring a present to the grave . Shortly after this the corpse is buried ,
