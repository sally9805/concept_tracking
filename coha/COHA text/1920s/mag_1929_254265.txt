" This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified ... by ... the several States . . . within seven years . <P> So reads Section 3 of the 18th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution . To the lay mind it may not seem particularly funny , but last week it caused Idaho 's Senator William Edgar Borah some great-though very temporary-amusement . <P> Much reading of the Constitution has made Mr. Borah a solemn man whom the ordinary run of jokes fails to amuse . But this time he had gripped , he thought , a Constitutional jest , the cream of which would taste sour in the mouths of the Wets . All a-chuckle , he was not hesitant in sharing it with the world . Rhode Island had raised a captious question on the 18th Amendment 's ratification . Senator Borah judicially pronounced it " utterly unsound " and then continued : <P> " There is , however , a much stronger point against the validity of the 18th Amendment . That is the seven-year limitation as to ratification . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood why Root and the other lawyers who argued the case in the Supreme Court did not raise this point . . . . But it is too late now for this objection . " <P> A prime joke this would have been , had not other students of Prohibition , perhaps less profound than Senator Borah but with better memories , recalled that on May 16 , 1921 , the Supreme Court had decided this exact point-and decided it solidly against Senator Borah 's present interpretation . In the case of Dillon v. Gloss , Mr. Justice Van Devanter delivered the unanimous opinion of the court : <P> " We do not find anything in the article that suggests that an amendment , once proposed , is to be open to ratification for all time . ... Of the power of Congress , keeping within reasonable limits , to fix a definite period for the ratification we entertain no doubt . "
