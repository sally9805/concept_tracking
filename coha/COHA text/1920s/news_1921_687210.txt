txt Seated in the office of the manager of the Lannard Steel company , Harry L. Rasher listened as that hard eyed individual stated his proposition . You say you do n't know anybody here and do n't belong to a union . Good . You will suit my purpose exactly if you have sense enough to keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you . " " I sure want a jab , " Rasher answered . " All right . This wo n't be hard work either . All I want you to do is to go ' round among the men and find what they 're talking about .

" The manager was now talking more to himself than to Rasher , who judged that long sustained labor coa- , . filets had so warped his thoughts into one groove that he could think of nothing else . How else could be explained his talkativeness to a stranger ? Rasher 's mind was working swiftly . The Work outlined for him was repugnant , and yet for his purposes it might prove to be the one thing most desired .

" It was settled that Rasher should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to come here with your reports unless I send for you , " said the manager . " I 'll arrange ' to ' have you deliver them to my secretary at her home . You must not be seen around hero more than necessary . " ' He then rang for his secretary . " Miss Brook , this Man is to go on as a truck driver , " 4 ' he announced . " He will make some special reports for me and deliver them at your house . Add his name to the pay roll .
