The economic factors underlying the Franco-Belgian action are to be found more in the domestic conditions of the countries concerned rather than in the occupied region . The Ruhr mines are yielding comparatively little coal , and both France and Belgium are forced to import supplies at an enormous cost . <P> France has been suffering from strikes in her most important coal fields , and it will be some time before she recovers from the effect . Belgium is threatened by a strike which may paralyze not only her coal supplies but her iron industry . <P> Both countries face a daily rising expenditure of about $100,000 for the direct cost of occupation . The Germans , too , are being forced to expend large credits on coal and food , but their hindering tactics are not so costly as the Franco-Belgian Ruhr administration .
