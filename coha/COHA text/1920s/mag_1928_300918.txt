Tom-toms beat ceaseless din as Edward of Wales &; Party approached , last week , the stronghold of that quaint , Afrlc potentate , H. H. Daudi Chau , the Kabaka of Buganda , East Africa . Though subservient to Great Britain , the Kabaka exercises many a right and power over his own people . Aloof , he resides within a spacious palace , surrounded by a woven fence of elephant grass , two miles in circumference and 15 feet high . <P> In all Buganda only the Kabaka himself may step upon a leopard skin , symbol of Royalty . But last week the Kabaka , clad in robes of blue and gold , led Edward of Wales to a throne chair set up beside his own and resting upon leopard skins . <P> Cried the Kabaka 's subjects : " Ump ! Toto ya Georgia ! " , " Hail ! Son of George ! " Said the Kabaka in faultless English to the Son of George V : " Welcome , Your Royal Highness , to this small , insignificant country of mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward of Wales , " to see such progress and prosperity in so remote a portion of the realm of His Majesty my father . " <P> Later the Kabaka showed H. R. H. the great bonfire which was lighted at the Kabaka 's birth and will burn steadily until he dies . <P> Well pleased Toto ya Georgia continued his Afric tour ( TIME , Sept. 17 et seq. )
