THERE is a widespread conviction that Bishop William Montgomery Brown really is a heretic . But there is another widespread conviction that heresy has n't hurt him any . Which is why he stays in the headlines even after his case has been " finally closed " . If heresy had broken out on the old man , or soured his soul or spoiled his looks , the reporters would have noticed it long before this . As is apparent from reading the newspapers , they give the old bishop all the breaks . It is n't often that New York makes a fuss over the visit of a bishop : but when it does happen , it is pretty sure to be Bishop Brown . And the more guilty he is the more completely and hopelessly beaten  --  the more space he seems to get . There is a reason . For there is something not only entertaining but decidedly newsy in old Bishop Brown 's brand of guilt . A super-heretic , according to all accepted theories , should be either sinister or sublime . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . He should be Gargantuan , Titanic , almost Rooseveltian in his impressiveness . It is not absolutely necessary that he be in eruption all the time : but when not in eruption , he should tremble threateningly . There is something disconcerting , therefore , when a reporter braces himself to encounter such a personage , to meet a benign and garrulous old gentleman , about as sinister in appearance as the memory of Mother 's prayers , and about as threatening in attitude as the poems of Eddie Guest . Plainly , he is n't the type . There is a twinkle of mischievousness about him , however , which suggests that he , in " Lightnin ' " , a character completely winsome if not noted for dynamic qualities : and if there should ever he a revival of " Old Lady 31 " , he ought to do it perfectly . Brown is about eighty years old , going on seventy . Five years ago he was at least ninety-two , but when the Church singled him out for a heresy trial , he grew young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken down in the service . If you have ever been Bishop of Arkansas for any considerable stretch , you know what that means . It means , in the first place , that there is nothing much to look forward to except heaven : and when there is nothing much to look forward to except heaven , one gets very old . Also , if he has been a fairly decent bishop , he becomes saintly . That 's what Brown did . Brown had been a good bishop , albeit a bit irascible at times . They do say , in the height of his virility , that he was something of a martinet . But all that has now faded out of his character , humility ' and benignity creeping in , as becomes One who has left Arkansas for heaven and is only waiting at Galion , Ohio , for the final summons . But the summons did n't come , and what to do in the meantime was apuzzle . A mischievous doctor suggested that he read Darwin . The Bishop thought that was a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , and he did n't see any reason why he should n't read him now . To a younger man , of course , it might be dangerous : but his faith was fixed , and Darwin certainly could n't injure a retired bishop . But it was through Darwin that he made a most disconcerting discovery . He decided that there was n't any heaven , and that , that being the case , even he , Bishop Brown , could n't go . It was a most extraordinary predicament : but having once started to read , he went on and devoured all the scientific literature he could . And right on top of that came the war , with all the Christian nations of earth praying to Christ to help them exterminate each other . It was just one hell of a fix , as anyone who has been Bishop of Arkansas can readily see . To make a sad story funny , Brown became a Socialist , then a Communist . His book " Communism and Christianism " was a sort of deathbed confession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had just found out that there was n't any place to go . There was nothing to do , apparently , but to write that hook and die . Nobody read the book , although it had a great twenty-five cent sale . That a Bishop of the Church had decided to " Abolish Gods from the Skies and Capitalists from the Earth " made the pamphlet a novelty : but the average reader got lost before he had covered many pages ; and so nothing much happened , either to science or religion , as a result of the publication . Churchmen , when interviewed , hinted that the old man was crazy . Such a suggestion was a shock to the former plenipotentiary of the See of Arkansas . It shucked him back to life . It made him sit up . He even indited a letter , suggesting that the churchmen were not necessarily competent alienists : but if they wanted to find out just how crazy he was , he would submit himself to a proper jury of psychologists . " They say I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not try me for heresy because they say I am crazy . And when I ask them what makes them think I am crazy , they point to my heresies . " The old bishop was sure enough coming back to life . He was something to reckon with after all ; and a year Later , three of his fellow-bishops formally presented him for trial . That changed things entirely . That brought his future in front of him once more . And gosh ! how the book began to sell ! He tottered into his first trial in Cleveland , two years ago , still quite unable to walk alone , but with a lively determination to find out what was what . Could the Church punish a man , in these days , for changing his mind ? What is the doctrine of the Church anyway , and just how far can anybody safely deviate from the ancient creeds ? Deviation seemed to be the order of the day  --  was there any point , he asked , where it had to stop ? Admittedly , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heresy ? His questions were not answered , and Bishop Brown took on another lease of life . He decided to get them answered . He decided to make the Church answer them . He decided to make everybody answer them : and he launched his questions sidewise right into the middle of a Nation-wide Modernist-Fundamentalist controversy . He soon took the center of the stage . The best that the others could do was to state the problem . Bishop Brown decided to be the problem instead . He found it great fun . He began to have the time of his life . Before his second trial occurred , he had put on thirty pounds . A few weeks later , he made his first public speech in years . Then he came to New York and found himself a headliner through innocently suggesting to Bishop Manning that he be invited to preach in the Cathedral . Ever since then , Bishop Brown has had all the fun of a fight without doing any fighting . He has n't had to fight ; for he has discovered that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them too . Also , he has learned how to be the storm center of a controversy without having to lead it in any way . He has no following to placate and can thus afford to be interesting all the time . All he has to do is to spill the beans and look innocent , and he does it perfectly . It was the Old Catholic Church which made Brown a bishop before the Protestant Episcopal Church had a chance to unmake him . Entirely aside from that , anybody with his visage would pass as a bishop anywhere . His halo speaks for itself and he spills benedictions with as little self-con-sciousness as he spills the beans . Americans do not fall for heretics who are quarrelsome , nor for those who are too aggressive , nor for those who have been technically discredited in any way . If Brown had actually lost his title as Bishop , the show might easily slump : and if Brown had been a fretful , high-keyed heretic , he might have developed a little following , and nobody else would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Americans being what they are , he is going to be allowed to believe anything he likes . The reporters , at any rate , can be depended upon to give him all the breaks . Bishop Brown may be a heretic , but that is n't the point . The point is that he is Bishop Brown : and anybody that starts to pick on him for his heresies is going to get himself disliked . For Americans are like that Lightnin ) Bill was a booze-fighter , but people even in the dryest communities fell for him just the same . Nevertheless , our heroes must not be ordinary and Bishop Brown is n't . We may admire people who are justlike us , but we ca n't love and worship them . In order to love and worship anybody , he must have all the virtues which we lack . Look at Christ . Everybody in America loves Christ because he was so different . " The Church can not trade any longer in the Blood of Christ , " he says , and for every little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . To be sure , it does sound heretical . But there is a certain directness about if which appeals to interviewers . It sounds as though the old man was n't holding anything back . Newspaper men wonder sometimes if other bishops do n't have moments of doubt . If they do , they never give it away . The result is that what they do say does n't carry much emphasis : while , when Brown says he loves the Church , everybody seems to believe him . If he did n't love it , they know , he would say so . When in doubt , he trumpets . Of course , he is n't intellectual . The other bishops have often pointed that out . He does n't believe the creeds literally , as the intellectuals do , but accepts them merely as poetic or symbolic expressions of religious faith . That was the only charge that was ever brought against him , and the bishop still hopes to get it thrashed out . Although he has had two trials and a formal deposition , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hearing on the issue in New Orleans : but he was so unintellectual that the House of Bishops finally decided not to give it to him . Which is one reason for his present visit to New York . He thinks the bishops have put the Church in an embarrassing situation and he is appealing to the civil courts to make them keep their promises . In spite of his lack of intellect , however , he is a good old boy . His soul is no doubt damned , but New York does n't care very much about that . New York is just chock full of sinners , and he is the sort of bishop that sinners can like . In the case of some bishops , this is a little difficult . You feel that you 've got to he careful what you say in order to stay in their company . With Brown , you can just come out with anything that is on your mind
