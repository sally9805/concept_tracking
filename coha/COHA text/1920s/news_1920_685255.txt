txt Reporting upon the demand for sol='diers ' and sailors ' bonuses , the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York says that if the sum of money required , which is estimated at ; 12,000,000,000 , were raised by a retroactive excess war profits tax , by a general sales tax , or by a bond issue , : % " any one of these methods would " mean an increase in the tax burden . " upon the business . of the country , " a burden that is already stifling en " terprise , " and it would " add to and protract the present inflation . " The Government would be reluctant to ask the taxpayers to take an issue Of bonus bonds . A higher rate of interest than the Victory Loan notes tarry , 4N , per cent. , would have to be offered , but who would subscribe for the bonds ? There are attractive opportunities to acquire securities that Pay 7 per cent . The Government could not afford to put out a 7 per , - 4cent. bonus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of 14 to 15 per cent. , and there may be a , further decline in them . It is not to be Lupposed that bonus bonds would be taken by the small holders of Liberty securities who have either sold them . at a loss or view them going steadily down in price with.misgivings . A bonus bond issue is out of the question , then . It may be gravely doubted whethet. a new tax on war profits would produce enough bonus money  --  that is say , $2,000,000,000 . Furthermore , collection of such a tax is considered impracticable . The mere attempt to trace the profits to be levied on would throw industry into disorder and unsettle business incalculably . Business is in the breakers as it is . No member of Congress whose opinion is worth having thinks that a retroactive war profits tax could possibly be a success . There is left the sales tax . The bonus money could be raised in that way , but a gathering storm of protest from the consumers who are desperately trying to make both ends meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that direction . ' While the politicians want to please the ex-service men , not because any principle of justice is involved , but to get their votes , no party desires to enter a Presidential campaign with a record of having deliberately added ? to the higher - cost of living . So men of both parties in Congress are now dividing about the wisdom of enacting bonus legislation at this session and asking the people to pay the piper . Sober rri. en in Congress are beginning to point out that to establish the precedent of paying bonuses to several millions of ex-service men would involve the country in an ever-swelling volume of payments to the men who wore the uniform in the war . Senator THOMAS of Colorado predicts that if a halt is not called upon the " blanket bonus " the demands of the ex-service men and their political friends will ultimately cost the country $25,000,000,000 . Senator 111cCu*BER estimates that appropriations on acmount of the very recent war already amount to ** but this the bonus campaigners entirely overlook ? it is a drop in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show its gratitude in ' a substantial manner . Who can doubt that pensions upon pensions , and still , more pensions , would be piled upon the blanket bonuses ? The Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York , at Its meeting on Wednesday , approved of liberal and generous provision for the disabled and for dependents of those who died in battle , and it declared that the cry Of bonuses " is contrary to the spirit s " of patriotism which animated the " American Expeditionary Force . " That is how the American people feel about the matter , and if the American Legion will sound them it will learn the truth .
