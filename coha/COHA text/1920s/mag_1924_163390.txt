The Strong . This turgid but powerfully analytical play adapted from the Danish of Karen Bramson stresses the point that Virtue , besides being its own reward , is its own weakness . An old , hunchbacked , club-footed professor , who in addition to going blind has about every other deformity of mind and body , saves a lovely girl from a brutal father , and then clutches at the girl . He forces her to marry him , through weakness and pity , and when she tries to elope with the sculptor she loves , the professor chains her to himself with the intangible but unbreakable bonds of gratitude . The strength of the frail proves so crushing that suicide alone can free the girl . Henry Herbert as the professor gave an insinuating study of the iron hand in the velvet glove . Helen Weir almost had the girl 's role at her finger tips . <P> Alexander Woollcott : " Miss Weir gallantly stormed a role that required at least a Duse . . . She needs voice training and experience . Time will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , and will gently suggest that an actress making her debut in an emotional role would do well to wash her hands . " <P> E. W. Osborn : " A story morbid and repellent beyond degree . . . . The only satisfaction which its presentation involves-a purely and coldly artistic one-is in the acting of Mr. Herbert . " <P> The Moon-Flower . Here romance rivals roulette at Monte Carlo as a game of chance . The speculative plunger is a penniless law clerk from Hungary who comes with his little hoard for a fling ; his prize is the official sweetheart of a wealthy Duke . The starveling dreamer dares to aspire to her love , and the great courtesan yields to him . She hopes to spite the Duke , who has ordered her to Paris to avoid a marital collision with his wife . Love awakens in her frostily brilliant eyes at the youth 's touch , but she realizes her arms will be a millstone around his neck . <P> She returns to the Duke , who , finding her humanized by love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal keeper does not mind whom she loves so long as her tenderness for somebody makes her forget she has a fiery temperament to uphold . Thus , on a cynical note , ends an uneven revelation that a too passionate wooer can play right into his rival 's hands . Despite its occasional irony , the play seems to be smitten with awe at moving among elegant folks in grand surroundings . With a first act that sparkles and others that go diminuendo , Miss Zo Akins remains the broad-jumping playwright . She leaps off with a great rush , then loses momentum . Elsie Ferguson recovers in the courtesan role the warm , stirring undercurrent of her earlier acting . Throwing off the cataleptic spell of the cinema , she no longer seems to be waiting for a closeup . Except for a farewell scene , Sidney Blackmer has the cold , damp passion of a clay statue . He seems hardly to have the resolution to kill himself-as he threatens to do at regular intervals but never does . A moonflower is a bloom that lives only between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-night stand , at times its fragrance fades .
