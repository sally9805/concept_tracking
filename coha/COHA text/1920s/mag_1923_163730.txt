A German recently visited London . Questioned by friends as to what impressed him most , he said that after the difficult conditions in Germany he could not help feeling impressed ! with the extraordinary feeling of confidence . <P> He had been warned that Londoners would receive him coldly , but he found people exceedingly courteous . <P> One fact impressed him more than anything else . The day after his arrival he reported to the police . The officer at the station-house actually apologized for inconveniencing him ! " I doubt , " he said , " if anyone in Germany would believe such a thing possible . "
