Following on the heels of the virtual downfall of Terrigiani , head of the Grand Orient Order of Masons in Italy , who was reduced to a position of political impotence by the recent Fascista decree denying political rights to the Masons , comes the news of Serrati 's arrest . Menotti Serrati is the editor of Avanti , most radical newspaper of the Socialist party . His arrest for plotting against the safety of the state is considered a vindication of Mussolini 's recent threat that he would carry his war against Bolshevism into the enemy 's camp . <P> When Serrati left Italy last October to attend the Third Internationale , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . The fact that he was forced to return secretly to his native land and that he found most of his colleagues against him , is striking proof of the decline of communist power in Italy . With the exception of the Socialist press not a dissenting voice was heard in all the land . <P> Mussolini declares that he has no prejudices against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the political and civil life of the country-he does not believe that the time has come for granting them suffrage . <P> Mussolini holds under advisement a scheme giving facilities to Italian emigrants whereby they may participate in the political elections of the homeland .
