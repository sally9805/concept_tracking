txt The debate on the World Court within the ranks of the Republican Party took on new vigor today , Senator Borah issuing an aggressive statement against the Harding proposal for joining the court and Elihu Root defending It strongly in an address to the American Society of International Law . Secretary Hughes will address the International Law Society tomorrow night and is expected to outline  --  the Administration 's case in great detail . Senator Borah 's comment was the most severe arraignment he has made of any of the policies of the Harding Administration . His position is that ' If the court is to live . the League which cresated it must also live and function . To view the proposal from any other standpoint , the Idaho Senator declared , was unworthy of the United States . Mr. Root , in his address , said that the question at issue was " merely whether we shall give our moral approval to the establishment of the same kind of a court which our Government has been urging for a generation . " He held that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not involve the United States in any , complication , as " we undertake to do nothing .041 : . to . give nobody authority or powCit0 , .. - tiO ? anything to us . " Watson in Harmonizer 's Role . Senator Watson of Indiana , who has been classed as an opponent of the court , called on President Harding . He let It become known that he was seeking to harmonize his party on the subject . Speaking for a majority of the Democrats , Senator of Tennessee commended the position of the President , who , he said , for more than two years had sought - faithfully but ineffectually to sustain his party 's doctrine of AznerI lean isolation from world affairs . He agreed with Senator Borah that the court was a ' part of the League , and he congratulated the President who , he said , like Saul of Tarsus , had " at last seen a light . " The blast from Senator Borah , following as it- did the statement issued yesterday by Senator La Follette , who denounced the Harding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally to the irreconcilable group some- Senators who , within a week , have been denouncing the court plan and prophesying a " wide open split " in. the Republican Party . All the indications are that these Senators are still quietly shaping their course so as to get back into the Administration camp with as Intel noise and publicity as possible . Nothing developed today with respect to Senator Lodge 's much heralded visit to the - White House . When he left the Executive offices . Senator Watson said he was on his way to confer with Mr. Lodge and that he might have something to say . At Senator Lodge 's office ? no one professed to know where the Massachusetts Senator was , If the conference was held , it was not in Mr : Lodge 's office . Neither was it held in Mr. Watson 's office . Mr. Watson was busy most of the afternoon , it was said , revising the speech which he is to make i in Pittsburgh tomorrow morning . A friend of the Senator said that in Pittsburgh he would attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even refer to the Court . McCormick Classed as Convert . Senator McCormick is another original opponent of the Court plan who has been impressed by President Hardilig 's New York speech . He Is believed to have returned to the fold , at least so far as open opposition to the Court is concerned . Senators who privately oppose the Court are now snowing a disposition either to support it publicly or else a reticence to speak their minds on the subject . Apparently they hope that in some way the whole question will not reach the Senate in time for a final vote before the election next year . This , of Course , does not apply to the BorahLa Follette-Norris-Reed group . A rumor was industriously circulated t.nd even found its way into print that President Harding was so distressed over political opposition to the World Court that he contemplated canceling his Western tour . Whatever the source of this rumor , it did not originate at the White House , for today found the President quietly going ahead with plans for his speaking tour . The statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the man who believes in the League and wants us to join it . But I can not understand , I am frank to say , those who insist we tnust not join the League , but must ' oin everything the League creates and Vet stay out of the League . I think the proposition that you can go into the League Court and still continue to be Eainst the League , or stay out of the ague , is the most remarkable proposin ever presented to the public . It is On impossible proposition . It would never be suggested if political exigency did Cot seem to reauire it . " We are told almost every day that tissis we join the I  --  league . It must Inevitably break down , that without the ' United States it can not ultimately succeed . There is a great campaign being Organized now to take us into the League in order that the League may be preserved . Suppose it becomes perfectly apparent to all , as it now is to so many , that unless the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those people who are now advocating this court under such eirLeague continue to oppose the League and let the court perish ? They Would know that the moment the League broke down their court must go . " If we are called upon in the future to bear our proportion of the expenses of the entire League or see It break down And lose the court , what will we do under such circumstances ? Will we put - dollars and cents value upon the court and say that if you people do not keep up the League , pay up the exp.enses of maintaining it , we will let the court perish ? " Grasping Selfishness " Suggested . " We are now more financially able than any one else , perhaps , to defray these expenses . Yet it is said that we can take the position before the world tl- , iie vast ex --  - nses of the Leafrue . Without which the League would fail and the court would fail , shall be borne by other nations . This is the position , Which , I venture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an exhibition of grasping selfishness the like of which no nation ever before advocated . " If we still want the Court and believe in the Court , shall we say to the League people : You fight it out , you make the sacrifice , we will have nothing to do with it , we are simply going to enjoy the fruits in case you succeed , to wit , the Court . Does anybody think that under these circumstances , a resertation  --  one of those technical things that lawyers like to play with  --  would bave the slightest effect ? It would be a reproach instead of a comfort . It Would be rejected as an insult , that is . Resuming that we were sincere in desiring to have the Court . I have my first pro-Leaguer to talk to . Republican or Democrat , Senator or private citizen . who does not believe that the going into this court takes us into the League and makes us a part of the League . Our Democratic friends will no doubt vote against some of these reservations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intellectual hypocrisy . But they will unhesitatingly vote for the court proposition With the reservations . " Let us make the issue plain and Clear , therefore . If the League of Nations has created a court which is Worthy of our adherence , has given us Pa tribunal which the world ought to have . I say that It is simply downright political cowardice to undertake to gather the fruits of the League and still Continue to fight the League . " It is just such a position as the old Democratic and Whig Parties took in 2852 upon the question of slavery . A itolitical party can not any more sacrifice ts morality , its intellectual integrity and ts moral being than an individual can . has got to be honest . The Republican ' arty , in asserting that it can go into e League Court and stay out of the League , is taking a position which will bring down upon it the moral condemnation of every one . " Commends Harding . The statement commending President Harding for his stand in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Justice ti-as created by the League of Nations compact and is a most important branch V the League . I have long believed in the interest of an orderly settlement of internal differences and in the interest of world peace that we should join this court , and , of course . I am glad that President Harding now takes the same view . For more than two years he and his party have sought faithfully , but Ineffectually , to carry out the doctrine of American isolation from world affairs . " A man must have little faith in his Own country who is afraid that official 0 .. nd legal representatives of the United States will not and can not defend the interests of this great nation In any assembly and in any conference in the World . We should be leaders in all Conferences . We should take the exalted place that the power of our nation gives us. and it is unworthy of us simply to have ' unofficial observers handicapped by lack of power . Like Saul of Tarsus , the President has at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I greatly marvel that there seems - to be so much division and dissension over the court in at least enough Republican Senators will join us Democrats in voting for the proposition to insure our entrance into the court .
