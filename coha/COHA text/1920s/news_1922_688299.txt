txt The Cohalans and the War . TO Me Editor of The New York Times : While a convinced believer and supporter of an untrammeled , unbowed and unprejudiced judiciary , knowing that It is the bulwark of this Republic , I must contest ; that the muddle over the Surrogate of New York County raleed by a Cohalan does not come within the scope of a non-partisan judiciary . How did Cohalan secure his nomination in 1908f Was it through the financial support and political influence of his brother Daniel , then Grand Sachem of the Tammany.Soaloty , the good nature and kindness of " Charlie " Murphy , and the gratitude and payment of an obligation by " Tim " Sullivan ? During the , World War , while presiding on the bench which was decorated with the American flag , he was continually pending presents in the shape of Surrogate notices to John Devoy , editor of The Gaelic-American , which by act of the Appellate Division , First Department , was peremptorily refused the advertisements for lack of circulation . The United States Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet the use of our mails . Surely New Yorkers have not forgotten how strenuously this organ had supported the enemies of our country while receiving the patronage of thin high-minded Surrogate . There Is nothing in the name Cohalan to admire or cherish . When 1 think of my nephew , James Phelan of Buffalo ; my nephew , Cyril Englebrido of Newburgh , N. Y. , who sleep in depth in Bony Cemetery in France seven graves apart , after the Hindenburg line was smashed : also my cousin and namesake from Bolton , England , who expired in Flanders field , coupled with the countless heroes from every State in our Union upholding gloriously the arms of their Government when civilization was at stake , while these people were receiving their salaries from the taxpayers of our city and In their every action were anxious for Jur defeat , is It any wonder that I myself with others have determined to defeat and meparate this greedy clan from the public payroll , as it is dangerous to free institu:ions for one faintly to have so much power ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1922.
