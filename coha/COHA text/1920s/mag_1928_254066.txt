When the Council of the League of Nations sat down to its June session in Geneva , last week , two famed faces were absent . One is nude , plump , confident ; the other shaggily mustached , and lined with weary wrinkles . As everyone knows , these are respectively the faces of German Foreign Minister Dr. Gustav Stresemann and French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand . Both are slowly convalescing from illness . <P> Accordingly , Germany was represented on the Council , last week , by that veteran pre-War and post-War " career diplomat , " Dr. von Schubert , now Assistant Foreign Minister . Came in behalf of France her reputedly richest citizen , M. Louis Loucheur , not long since Finance Minister . ( TIME , Dec. 28 , 1925 ) . Just prior to leaving Paris last week , M. Loucheur accepted the post of Minister of Labor , replacing unlucky M. Andr Fallire , who lost his parliamentary seat in the recent French election ( TIME , April 30 , May 7 ) . <P> During sessions of the League Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friend , Aristide Briand . On such occasions the richest man in France frequently leaves and returns to his seat by leaping nimbly over the top of his desk , in order to avoid disturbing Great Aisle Seater Briand . Last week , however , French Representative Loucheur leaped for no man . <P> Present as the only Foreign Minister of a Great Power to attend was Sir Austen Chamberlain , jovial to fellow diplomats , glacial to the press , British . <P> Questions . Up before the Council were three vital questions upon which it had delayed to act for months or years : 1 ) Shall the Rumanian Government pay compensation for lands expropriated by it from Hungarian citizens ? ( TIME , Sept. 26 ) ; 2 ) Should the League fix responsibility and apply censure in the matter of the Italian arms which were smuggled into Hungary in defiance of the Treaty of Trianon ?
