The following estimates of books much in the public eye were made after careful consideration of the trend of critical opinion : <P> POEMS-Katharine Mansfield-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . A collection of poems by the author of Bliss and The Dove 's Nest ( TIME , Sept. 10 ) . They do not compare with her stories . In fact , the best that can be said for them is that a few - Sleeping Together , To L. H. B.- rise above the average , and that anything done by Katherine Mansfield is likely to be at least graceful . <P> SIEGE-Samuel Hopkins Adams- Boni &; Liveright ( $2.00 ) . What happens when a woman of the old type , representing authority and tradition , comes in contact with the new woman , straightforward , honest to her own standards , but determined to be controlled by the standards of no one else ? Augusta Ruyland is the woman of the old type . She is the head of the Ruyland family . She controls the mill town of Habersham and all the Ruylands ' interests there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better terms than union labor gets . But she is a despot- insistent upon having her own way . The new woman is Fredericka Gage , who marries Kennion Ruyland , Augusta 's grandnephew . Since Fredericka will not be dominated , the fight begins . In the end-after a lawsuit , a suicide , much biting talk and a dramatic strike in the Ruylands ' factory- Fredericka wins . It is an exciting novel that moves swiftly , without faltering . But it has at least one considerable fault . It claims to be a serious " study . " Yet for all its modern setting , much of it seems hardly any more connected with actuality than the incidents of a tale by Jules Verne . <P> MR . ARCHER , U. S. A.-R . H. Platt , Jr. - Doubleday ( $2.50 ) . The self-told tales of an old timer in the army , " translated into writing from the oral , " are made into a book . It is the life story of a man who satisfied his wanderlust in the Army . He took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boxer Rebellion , in an Honduran revolution , in the Great War , and tells about them all as his personal adventures . The book has no style except the lingo of the doughboy , but it makes a flowing tale that carries the reader off forgetfully , through innumerable adventures , human , dangerous , unbelievable , yet convincingly real .
