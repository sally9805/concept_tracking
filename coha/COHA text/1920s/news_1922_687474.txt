txt The flood of words and torrents of ink which are flowing over and around the Genoa conference project may easily hide from world public opinion for the moment the fact that the great outstanding world political development of the day Is the agreement on the Anglo-French alliance . Its im ? portance is ten times that of the Genoa conference . . The Anglo-French treaty of allianoe. which is to be signed In London before the opening of the economic negotiations on April 10 , will of necessity have its repercussion in all quarters of the globe . If it means anything it must mean an end of the tiresome quarrels between England and France which have cursed Europe since Nov. 11 , 1918 . In the present state of flux of world affairs a tight union between England and France has untold possibilities , provided the statesmen of those two countries have enough wisdom and enough skill to maintain that union , which is rally desired by tha two peopled . After returhink to their respective capitals from the noulogne meeting yesterday both Premier Poinearn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Considered as consummated and that all differences with respect to it had been removed . Victory Gained for Poland . It Is understood that the treaty of guarantee by which England pledges herself to come Immediately to France 's aid in case of unprovoked attack by Germany and to support France in enforcing German disarmament will run for twenty years Instead of ten , as originally proposed , and that there is addition the important chamie that England and France pledge themselves to act In accord in case of trouble on the eastern frontier of Germany . This , of course , means that England and France promise to protect Poland against attack by Germany  --  a considerable victory gained by France for her proldg6 . It will be remembered that when M. I3riand presented the text of the original proposed treaty of alliance many French leaders objected that the shortness of its duration made It valueless , inasmuch as no one expected Germany to attempt to attack France in the next ten years .. Doubling the term of the treaty naturally adds its value for France . It now bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , England and America which was never ratified , except that there is a time limit . From the world-wide standpoint the alliance grows in importance from the circumstance that France and England can not act together with regard to Germany without being in accord on other international questions affecting them . It is not to be expected that the two nations will he in perfect harmony on the Rhine and In discord at the Dardanelles . Conclusion of the alliance will justify ' the hope that the two big allies will at last find a common policy on reparations and In Asia Minor . Interest of the United States . America has an interest in the FrancoBritish alliance . It has been the case ever since the Paris Peace Conference that with England and France as rivals , America 's entrance into world politics on a real scale ' meant that she would hold the balance of power , The close partnership between England and France changes that and puts ' us on a different footing . In parenthesis it should be said that the United States stands responsible indirectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League of Nations and made it the real organi ? zatlon it was intended to be , England and France would not have faced the necessity of the alliance about to be concluded . The covenant 's framers intended it to make unnecessary the system of military alliances , and that it has not done so Is due in the largest agree . to abstinence of- " America ' tom League activity . It is not to be supposed that the new alliance will bring unmitigated joy to every Englishman or Frenchman who breathes the breath of life . Not at all . It is a partnership of many difficulties . inherent from centuries of ' political rivalry . It is a partnership which has been decided upon as the next beet thing to an association of the Allies and the United States to restore world stability . America made impossible the first choice of England and France . They now turn to the second-best choice .

He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind the inconveniences of tying up tight with England , French statesmen , up to the opening of the Washington conference , held to ' the hope of international action by the side of America , with England leading the opposing facti6n . It did not take M. Briand long to discover at Washington that that dream would not come true . He returned to Europe his mind made up that he must Make a bargain with London . That policy of M. Briand has been carried out by M. Poincard . And England and France will form a combination hard to beat . kronelk Press Is Enthusiastic . PARIS , Feb. 26 ( Associated Press ) . ? The newspapers today are practically Unanimous in heartily endorsing the results achieved by Premier Poineare of France and Prime Minister Lloyd George of Great Britain at their conference in Boulogne yesterday . The Figaro says : " It was a good day for the Franco-British entente , which was strengthened by the meeting of the Premiers . " The Journal comments : " Much notable work may be accomplished in four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who meet in a friendly spirit . " Pertinax in the Echo de Paris says : " The meeting of the Premiers gives us complete satisfaction concerning the Genoa conference . " The Action Francaise , with Royalist leanings , declares : " Prime Minister Lloyd George verbally acquiesced in PreMier Poincares suggestions to which he had failed to reply in writing . " The Gaulois simply observes : " It was a memorable and capital day for the Franco-British entente . " The Humana &; with Communistic tendencies , strikes the single discordant note in its declaration : " French militarism and British commerce are still arrayed against each other , quarreling about the advantages secured from their supremacy . " The Temps says the moral effect , perhaps , is the most valuable , as nations are not exclusively led , as theorists believe , by juridical reasoning and economic abstractions , but obey instinct and sentiment . The Journal des D  --  bats expresses the belief that the . happiest result , of the meeting will be a resumption of cordial Personal relations by the two states-men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tales . LONDON , Feb. ** opinion is divided as to whether much or little Was done at the meeting ' between the British and French Premiers at Boulogne . Those papers which hoped that European disarmament would be discussed at Genoa console themselves by recalling that , after all , disarmament Was not on the agenda for Genoa agreed to by Lloyd George and Briand at Cannes , and it is pointed out that should the nations at Genoa agree upon a truce for ten yeare or more , as Lloyd George May propose , meanwhile recognizing and accepting existing frontiers , the way might be opened for a later agreement for a reduction of armies . France recognizes that as the League of Nations does not include Germany and Russia it could not undertake the task prescribed for Genoa . This is one point obtained by Lloyd George , who argues that to turn over the work of the Genoa conference to the League of Nations , as France had seemed to want to do , would be to make American participation Wholly impossible . The Daily News gays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the securing of guarantees from Russia for the payment of her debts , it is fair to ask Mincer() whether he Is prepared to give on behalf of France the same guarantee to England and America that he demands from Russia . " On the whole The Daily News thinks the meeting between Lloyd George and Poincare was " a decisive diplomatic victory for the French Premier . " The Westminster Gazette 's political correspondent says : " There can be little doubt that the question of the allied debts was raised and that this is one of the matters which will be discussed at Genoa . Mr. Lloyd George is credited with a plan fo the remission of these debts on the condition of France adopting a more reasonable attitude toward Germany by agreeing to accept a reasonable sum in cash and kind . " His ideas are said to be very farreaching , and they are based on the hope that America , will be a party to the compact for remission of debts between the Allies . But if he is to obtain the co-operation of America he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on armaments . If France would change her attitude to armaments and the military occupation of the Rhine , the Prime Minister , it is said , believes he could induce America to assist in the work of Europe 's reconstruction . On this basis Mr. Lloyd George would be able to build a far-reaching plan for the revival of trade . It is hardly posse 1e that such questions could have been settled in one conversation . " All the papers agree that the main thing is that the Genoa bonference is still in being . The Daily Telegraph 's diplomatic correspondent says : " The restriction relating to the intangibility of existing treaties was apparently at first assumed in France to cover not only those of Versailles , St. Germain , Trianon and Neuilly , but also the group of commercial and military conventions concluded between France and other Allies and among the latter . It is even hinted that a similar demand will be put forward by various border States in regard to their recent treaties with the Moscow Soviet . This remains to be seen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not inconceivable that on such a basis a mutual undertaking by all ' the powers to refrain from aggression against their neighbors might yet be arrived at , albeit with greater difficulty than in other circumstances . A concomitant measure of military disarmament is widely favored , on the British side . The French thesis , however , is that no concrete decisions to this effect can be taken except by the League of Nations and that Germany 's disarmament has tot been completed . But the reduction in naval armaments agreed to at Washington was decided altogether outside the League . Poincar ? urged at length that the League should be directly associated with the conduct of proceedings at Genoa on the grounds that some of ths problems to be discussed came within the specific scope of the covenant and that the technical personnel of the League was highly skilled . But In the end he realized the force of the British contentions that such a. move would definitely bar all hope of American co-operation and might antagonize Russia , and might in any event create fresh difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia .
