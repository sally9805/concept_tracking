It was an unexpected appointment but unsensational . It was so purely personal and political , that it was uninteresting . Yet it seemed adequate . President Coolidge himself had pointed out that the Department of the Interior is so well staffed and organized that it scarcely would need a chief to replace Dr. Hubert Work for the balance of the Coolidge administration . <P> So Roy Owen West of Illinois became Secretary of the Interior without reasonable doubt that the Senate would confirm him when it meets . Aged 60 , circumspect , alert , " regular " pince-nezzed , he had done well as a Chicago lawyer , served faithfully as a G. 0 . Politician in Illinois ( five times State Chairman , three times National Delegate , twice National Committeeman , and for the Coolidge campaign National Secretary ) . This year he was to have been vice chairman of the National Finance Committee , but he said he would resign that job at once and " familiarize myself with the great office for which I have been chosen . " <P> The Summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no way meant to presume upon or embarrass the Cabinetmaking of a hypothetical President Hoover .
