" He declared that the Chemical Foundation and he himself personally were going to see the fight through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in acting against the Chemical Foundation the Harding Administration was simply being hoodwinked by the Germans , who wished above all things to get back into their own hands control of the organic chemical industry of the whole world .

Witness my hand and official seal this 8th day of July , 1922 . THOMAS W. MILLER , Allen Property Custodian : Foundation Run at a Loss . Mr. Garvan said that the Chemical Foundation started with about $438,000 capital . It has been run at a loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 150 stockholders , all big chemical firms , have not been assessed for this loss , he said , and now , for the first time , the foundation is paying expenses . Mr. Garvan referred frequently to the printed record of his testimony on the organization of the Chemical Foundation before the Senate last March . " This thing seems to have developed into a personal thing with you ; just why did you go into it ? " he was asked . " I went into it , " he said , " because as Alien Property Custodian , I saw the importance of the chemical industry unfoldedbefore me . It was a job that came to me and I ca n't let go , and it is a job I am going to " I am going through with it for the benefit of American industry , the American Army and NaVy and the American people . I will tell you if you want to know what my most heartfelt motive Is . It is the development of medicine . That is the thing which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been given its freedom can take care of itself . ' Once industry is developed national defense will be secure . But the main thing is the development of research in this country on the chemistry of the human body . In this respect the Chemical Foundation is absolutely a philanthropic institution . " Mr. Garvan told- how a certain big plant had been sold by the Alien Property Custodian and purchased by a concern whose Directors all had German names . But those men were the fine old Germans of Ohio and Pennsylvania who had been there since the Revolution  --  the finest fellows in the world , " he said . " HoweVer , that brought the face to face with the fact that this company had paid millions of dollars for the patents that belonged to this one concern . If I Went to put the others up At auction the Germans could be in the position of buying the other patents and becoming absolute monopolistic holders of the patents . " And that started us to devise some way by Which they Could be Made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We couldn t give them to the Government because there would have been nobody to take care of them  --  nobody to look into the patents and go around urging people to study them , &c.,; and nobody to prevent the infringements of the Germans after the war , and nobody to go in and invest if we threw them open , because no man knew but what the minute the armistice was declared Congress would give back the plants and they would have nothing but their patents . Whole Strength of Germany . " There was the job dumped on to me . I had a position where I had to know it , because every German knew the importance of the chemical industry , and if you read , day in and day out , their papers , as we went through their companies , you would have realized that it was the whole strength of Germany . It was the whole thing on which they based their preparation for the war . Germany would have been licked within three months if - it had not been for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Germany that they were ready and that they were not dependent on the Chileans for chemistry , and that meant in 1013 the war was made certain . She made her explosives and everything else in her dye ' ? factories . I can show you those documents again ' and again  --  like that telegram from Bernstorff. , Ilernstorff cabled , ' If you shut off the supplies of dyes now , you can throw 4,000,000 men out of work in America . ' " Mr. Garvan reviewed the history of the Foundation , established through authority granted by Acting Secretary of State Frank L. Polk and approved by President Wilson . Referring to the dye and drug patents , Mr. Garvan continued. : " Congress gave the G ( ions all that they had , and it can haru.y be accused of unfairness If it takes these patents away when it sees that they were taken out for the purpose of strangling American development ; that they were used to shut us off from medicinal supplies during the strain and stress of war ; that they were used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts policy against the English blockade . " As the Germans took them out , the patents contain none of the information as Congress intended . They are so fixed that you can make nothing out of any of them except by expenditure of thousands of dollars and the utmost energy In research , Germany , I repeat , took out these patents to injure the United States . She can have no objection if the Congress which granted the patents now takes them back again . " Mr. Garvan declared that he himself received not one penny of salary as an official of the Foundation and that never had he either asked or received a nickel for expense money . Special to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , July 10 . ? Attorney General Daugherty today refused to comment upon the demand on the Chemical Foundation . Mr. Daugherty , who has returned to Washington after a week 's absence , said that the case would be taken under investigation by the extra Federal Grand Jury recently created by special act of Congress to hear warcontract cases , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss matters pending before Grand Juries.
