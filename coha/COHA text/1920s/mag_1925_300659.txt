The value of memberships in speculative exchanges , like the price of speculative commodities and securities themselves , usually rises before and during a period of business prosperity . Recently , in Manhattan , two new records for exchange memberships were made : 1 ) In the New York Cotton Exchange , $35,000 was paid for a " seat " ; later two bids , one at the same figure and one at $37,000 , were made without calling forth any offers . 2 ) On the New York Curb Exchange , a seat brought $10,000-also a new high price for all time . <P> Seats on the New York Stock Exchange have not yet attained their record of price of $115,000 , reached in 1920 , but they have nevertheless climbed within reaching distance of it . The last reported sale of a seat on the " Big Board " was for $108,000-an advance of $5,000 over the previous sale . Moreover , it is said that $110,000 has been subsequently bid for a Stock Exchange seat in vain .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
