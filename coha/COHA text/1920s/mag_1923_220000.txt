John Powell , the American composer who has used American Negro tunes so extensively in his compositions , has given to The Kansas City Star a statement that will seem to many a strange pronouncement . Powell does not think that Negro music can figure considerably in the development of an American national school of music . Says The Star : " At any rate , Powell does not believe they ( Negro spirituals ) can justly be made the basis of a national American school - because , he declares , there is not the least kinship between the Negro and the descendants of the first English settlers , who still are presumed to boil highest in our melting pot . Mr. Powell favors using the ' Lonesome Tunes ' of the Tennessee and Carolina mountains for the basis , if such there is to be . The strange melodies are genuinely of ' our people , ' he points out , and of a strange and lasting fascination . "                  @ @ @
