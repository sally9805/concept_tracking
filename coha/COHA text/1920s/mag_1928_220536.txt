What would the editor of the patrician London Times say to blatant " Big Bill " Thompson , should they meet face to face ? Last week onetime Times Editor Henry Wickham Steed vowed , at London , that he spoke as follows when recently in Chicago : <P> " I said to Mayor Thompson , ' it is a great grief to me to find Chicago , which I had expected to see a go-ahead , up-to-date , forward , driving city , such a miserable , stick-in-the-mud , backwater town . Here you are with your noses stuck in the end of the eighteenth century , smelling about a miserable old quarrel between an old German king on one hand and George Washington on the other , and not thinking for a moment that you are 150 years behind the times . ' " <P> The House of Commons passed through second reading , last week , a bill proposing as the legal date of Easter " the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April . " At present Easter is the first Sunday after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or about the 21st of March ) . The dates of all other " movable feasts " depend on that of Easter . If the British bill passes third reading , a world conference will be called by British Home Secretary Sir William ( " Jix " ) Joynson-Hicks " to consider joint action . " <P> A charming flippancy is one of the attributes of Edward of Wales . Addressing the Birmingham Jewelers ' and Silversmiths ' Association , he recently said : " I would not like to say positively whether the idea of a pair of earrings actually sprang from the human brain before the idea of a pair of trousers . . . but your industry may claim to be one of the oldest if not the oldest of human handicrafts . " <P> At Oxford , Major General Sir Ernest Dunlop Swinton , one of the principal collaborators in the invention of the " tank , " lectured last week . Lectured he : " When the next great struggle comes , the belligerent nations will not have any scruples regarding treaties . They will consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a formal declaration of hostilities . " <P> Gossip spiced , last week , the appointment of Sir William George Tyrrell to become British Ambassador at Paris . He has been for 15 years the most influential bureaucrat at the Foreign Office , and since 1925 its permanent Under-Secretary . But he and Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain have never " clicked . " Because the Foreign Office must smoothly " go on forever , " a comfortable post has been found for Sir William in France . <P> The-new Ambassador will replace the Earl of Crew'e , who has just turned three-score-and-ten . At the Foreign Office the new permanent Under-Secretary will be Sir Ronald Lindsay , now Ambassador at Berlin , widower of one U. S. wife , and husband of another , the onetime Miss Elizabeth Sherman Hoyt of Manhattan . <P> At a recent banquet of the corporation of the City of London , Edward of Wales held out his hand for shaking to a lean , sad , elderly person of impeccable and impressive mien . <P> " B-but , Your Royal Highness , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Undismayed , Edward of Wales grasped the person 's hand and shook it warmly , remarking , " I do n't see that your profession makes any difference . "
