No one sings two verses of " Home , Sweet Home " which run as follows : <P> To us , in despite of the absence of years , How sweet the remembrance of home still appears ! <P> From allurements abroad which but flatter the eye The unsatisfied heart turns and says with a sigh : <P> Home , home ! Sweet , sweet home ! <P> There 's no place like home ! <P> There 's no place like home ! <P> Your exile is blest with all fate can bestow-But mine has been chequer 'd with many a woe ! Yet though diff'rent our fortunes , our thoughts <P> are the same , And both , as we dream of Columbia , exclaim : <P> Home , home ! Sweet , sweet home ! <P> There 's no place like home ! <P> There 's no place like home ! <P> They are not sung because , until last week , they have never been published . But they are included in a manuscript copy of the song given to the Library of Congress last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Embassy . <P> Poet John Howard Payne wrote the extra verses in 1829 as a personal tribute to the " exile " of the verses-Lucretia Augusta Sturgis Bates , wife of Joshua Bates , famed London banker ( Baring Bros . ) . Both Mr. and Mrs. Bates were natives of Massachusetts . He gave great gifts toward the founding of Boston Public Library . Their London years were cheered by opulence , popularity . But Poet Payne , who also spent most of his life away from his native U. S. , was a homeless , often unhappy , expatriate , visited by the nostalgia which led him to write his famed song . When he met Mrs. Bates she asked him to inscribe the words in her autograph book . He did so , composed the two special stanzas , concluded : " I have added a few words more , addressed to you ... What this trifle wants in poetry you will do me the justice to believe is made up in truth . " He died in Tunis .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
