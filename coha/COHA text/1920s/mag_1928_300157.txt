Americans know that Thomas Alva Edison invented the " Kinetoscope " ; and Frenchmen know that Louis Lumire invented the " Cinematograph . " Experts still wrangle over which of these inventions was the more basic ; but grizzled Louis Lumire has long since ceased to care . Interviewed last week in Paris he barely condescended to observe : " My . brother Auguste and I looked upon our invention as a novelty , capable of offering distraction for a few moments only . . . . The Americans have taken a toy and made it into a trade . . . . Primarily I am a chemist . I have little or no time to go to the cinema . ... I do not think I have ever seen or heard before of the women you call ' Clara Bow ' and ' Lillian Gish . ' ... I myself turned the crank when my brother and I took our first motion picture . It was of Auguste sculling our rowboat across the River Rhone . " <P> Strikingly different from the nonchalance of Old Louis Lumire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Vittorio Emmanuele of Italy and Prime Minister Benito Mussolini proceeded to inaugurate , at Frascati , near Rome , last week The International Institute of Educative Cinematography . <P> Boomed Il Duce : " Cinematography ranks with the printing press as a formidable instrument for the conquest and diffusion of culture ! " <P> Although the I. I. of E. C. will operate on funds supplied by the Italian Exchequer , it is under the political aegis of the League of Nations . Also established in Italy this year , under the same potent patronage and auspices is The International Institute of Private Law .
