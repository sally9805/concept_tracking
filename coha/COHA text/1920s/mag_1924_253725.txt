From England was reported a sharp increase in the number of cases of the new sleeping sickness ( Encephalitis lethargica ) . Every week of 1924 has revealed , for that matter , a relentless increase . For the week ending Jan. 12 the number was ten ; for the week ending April 19 , 253 . Only 541 cases were recorded for the whole of 1919 . The current year thus far has recorded 1,409 cases . <P> Lethargic encephalitis has not the slightest connection with African sleeping sickness ( Trypanosomiasis ) . The name is more appropriate to the former disease than to the latter . Sleep symptoms are not invariably characteristic of the African sickness , but they occur whenever the parasite localizes in the fluid of the spinal cord or in the brain . Since they are conspicuous when present , the disease got its popular name from them . Sleep is a marked and invariable symptom of encephalitis , ranging from a light slumber to a profound coma . <P> The cause and cure of encephalitis are still unknown . There are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide attention when it appeared in Europe and North America in the wake of the epidemic of influenza in 1917-18 , and it has been noticeable in England only for the last five years . Its history , however , is longer , for a few isolated cases were recorded in Central Europe in 1712 , and it followed , also , the influenza outbreak of 1890 . <P> It is probably not communicable . In the U. S. the case fatality rate has been about 29% , with the greater number of fatalities in cases where the onset of the disease was sudden . The onset is usually gradual . Symptoms : Headache , vertigo , eye troubles , changes in speech , a low fever , a peculiar masklike expression of the face , a lethargy which gradually develops into coma , or , rarely , into wakeful delirium . <P> In 1918 investigators of the U. S. Health Department decided that encephalitis is " a specific disease and must be caused by a specific living virus which has a specific affinity for the central nervous system .

It never occurs outside of Africa . It has been almost conquered by driving the fly away from human habitations , and the prescribed method of treatment ( usually with arsenic in certain forms ) is generally effective . Unlike encephalitis , trypanosomiasis is always characterized by a severe progressive fever-a daily rise of temperature . <P> Better remedies for trypanosomiasis will be needed as long as there are tsetse flies in Africa . During 1920 Germany is known to lave developed a valuable trypanocide , " Bayer 205 . " This medicine was so effective that it attracted the attention of all interested in tropical diseases , but its makers refused to tell the secret of its composition . The Germans virtually offered it as the price for the restoration of their African colonies ( TIME , Feb. 4 ) . <P> At last a French chemist , Fourneau , and his associates have produced a substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
