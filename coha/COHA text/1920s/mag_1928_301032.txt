One year after Appomattox , her parents christened her Martha McChesney Berry . For her they must have envisioned a gracious membership in the Colonial Dames of America , and the Daughters of the American Revolution , also a brilliant Southern marriage . But Miss Berry never married . Nor did she choose the delicately charming life of a Southern aristocrat . <P> Twenty-six years ago Miss Berry founded a school high in the Georgia mountains . The schoolroom was a log playhouse on Captain Berry 's estate . The pupils , ten , were the children of poor families living in the mountains . <P> Today 1,000 students attend the Berry Schools , now an institution of more than 50 buildings sprawled over a portion of a 10,000-acre estate . But the pupils are no different from the first ten . <P> No child of the rich may enter the school . But many a half pagan urchin , wont to roam wildly in the Georgia hills , has been received . There are 7,000 names on the alumni list of the Berry Schools . <P> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medal " For Distinguished Service " ( TIME , May 25 , 1925 ) . Last week . Miss Berry received yet another honor and reward . She won the annual prize of $5,000 given by Pictorial Review magazine to the U. S. woman who has made the greatest contribution to art , letters , science or the social sciences . None doubted that Miss Berry would immediately turn the $5,000 to profit for her school . <P> Other winners of the Pictorial Review Prize have been : in 1924 , Mrs. Edward A. MacDowell , widow of the late Composer MacDowell , for her musicaliterary colony in Peterborough , N. H. ; in 1925 , Cora Wilson Stewart , for her Moonlight Schools , and her work discouraging illiteracy ; in 1926 , Sara Graham Mulhall , for her work decreasing the drug traffic ; in 1927 , Actress Eva Le Gallienne , for her organization of the Civic Repertory Theatre in New York City .
