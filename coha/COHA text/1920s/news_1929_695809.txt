txt Western Union Telegraph Co ' s preliminary statement . covering cperations for 12 months ended December 31 , 1928. with last month estimated , was better than earlier 1928 predictions had indicated and in point of net it was the second best year in the company 's history . Report showed net income of $15,373,669 after depreciation . taxes . rentals and interest . equivalent to $15 01 a share earned on 1,024,0S2 shares , compared with $15,030,453. or $15.06 a share , on 997.866 shares in 1927 . Increase in shares was due to employes ' stock participation plan . Company showed the largest gross in its history with 5139.244,596 , compared with $134,460,816 ft year earlier . and S54 25 : ' , 411 ten years ago . Undoubtedly a fair amount of the gross increase emanated from the cables business which , while rapidly expanding in volume , has not shown a like increase in profits owing to the competitive conditions under which the foreign business is carried on . At the same time . Western Union has been in the van in making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly putting into operation new forms of cable letter service throughout the world which ulti ' mately will increase revenues greatly as the public realizes the value of the service . In ten years . net income has increased from $11 619. - 513 in 1918 to $13.373.669 in 1928 . Company 's ability to keep a firm hold on expenses , despite the fact that wa.ge3 of workers have been increased steadily year by year . as well as the income participating plan which workers enjoy . has been one of the important factors in the ' good earnings statements which the company has been able to show year after year . Dividend. , Paid Each ' Year Company 's earnings a share In the past decade have ranged from a low point of $9.65 in 1921 , a depression year , to a high of 516.22 in 1923 . Taking an average over that period , the company has earned approximately 514 a share and the dividend rate , which ruled at 7 , , from 1917 , was increased to Se. - in 1928 . Company , previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but Newcomb Carlton has favored permanency and a stable rate and no extras have been declared in ten years Dividends have been paid in each year with two yearly exceptions for half a century . The management is not in favor of stock dividends nor split-ups and steadfastly has maintained an attitude of a well-earned stable rate for the shareholders in the matter of wage increases , approximately 54,000,000 , or $4 a share . on the capital stock has been added to the payroll . Sir Carlton 's contention that a happy corporate family makes for better and bigger business apparently is being justified with the increasing gross and the ability of the workers to keep expenses down at points where revenues have been reduced for one reason or another . It is not expected that there will be any dividend increase at this time . Furthermore , with every prospect of increasing competition with the Postal Telegraph Co. recently affiliated with the International Telephone Sz Telegraph Co .. It is obvious that the Western Union will fortify itself against this as well as radio competition in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' - of the land lines of the country , is strongly entrenched to meet competition . Radio Development Expected It is expected that some development will take place linking the communications business of the Radio Corp . with the Western Union . At present although the Western Union does much of the pick-up and delivery business of the Radio Corp . it has no contract with the Radio Corp The contract expired a year ago and has not been renewed . At the same time it is known that conversaUons have been going forward between the two companies With respect to a working agreement as to the communications business . The White Act is a touchy point , but it has been hoped that this can be circumvented and the two companies get together in a natural merger to meet world competition . Newcomb Carlton always has averred that this would be a natural evolution of the communications business , and , of course . Great Britain already has formed its **25;258;TOOLONG ! s mergei It has been expected that if such a plan were to go into operation a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the communications business of the Radio Corp . would go . This would leave the Radio Corporation free to develop its huge amusement business plans which really represent more than 90 ' , or the present operations of the company . Nothing official has been heard of these plans which are apparently in abeyance following active discussions late in 1928 . Western Union is selling currently at 195 compared with a low of 1391-2 and high of 201 in 1928.
