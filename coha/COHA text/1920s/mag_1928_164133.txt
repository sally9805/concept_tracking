The bung to Ontario 's liquor supply is a clause providing that liquor may not be warehoused by the makers , that it must be kept in transit . Commercial enterprise has kept this bung out . Scores of warehouses line the Ontario shoreline and load up U. S. rum-runners . Diplomatic pressure , probably , was what drove the bung in last week , when the Ontario Liquor Control Board seized $5,000,000 of beer and whiskies in two warehouses at Windsor . Thirty other storage plants with $50,000,000 worth of goods were threatened . <P> The charge was that the liquor , instead of proceeding normally through bootleg channels into the U. S. , was being sneaked back into Canada to compete illegally with Government-operated stores . <P> One of the warehouses seized belonged to Carling Brewing and Export Co. , famed for its pure , potent ale , which can be and is bought between Chicago and Buffalo for 75 the bottle , and up .
